PEEK INSIDE A MAYAN TOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rio Azul archeological project in Guatemala is considered one of the finest 
examples of early classic Mayan culture, encompassing the period from about AD 
250-600. "Rio Azul: City of the Storm God," highlighting discoveries from the 
excavation, will be at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County 
beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists began excavating the site in 1982, but found that many of the 
burial sites had been sacked by looters. Artifacts from unlooted sites, 
however, proved to be an invaluable source of new information about the Mayan 
people and will be on display. A highlight of the exhibit is a replica of a 
tomb re-creating the scene at the moment it was discovered by archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
"Rio Azul" continues through Nov. 11. Call (213) 744-3466.

STATE'S REPORT ON MALATHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "State Panel Says Malathion No Serious Health Threat," Part A, 
Aug. 16: 
</P>
<P>
So the state Department of Health Services issued its pro-malathion 
"health-risk assessment" report. There were no surprises, since we had 
previously been told what the report was to conclude. 
</P>
<P>
My wife was made so ill from the sprayings (verified by five-figures in medical 
costs and her doctor's opinion) that she has fled our home of 15 years and 
resided in a hotel outside the spraying areas for four months. Don't tell us 
about the health risks of malathion! 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone see anything ironic here: 
</P>
<P>
1) We spray first, investigate later? 
</P>
<P>
2) We spray people, not fruit? 
</P>
<P>
3) We declare spraying is safe, but the victims cannot sue the state to let a 
jury hear the evidence and decide the issue? 
</P>
<P>
4) Smog has to be reduced because it's unhealthy, but it is acceptable to spray 
a biocide on the populace? 
</P>
<P>
5) We export pesticides to other countries that are illegal here and import the 
fruit on which it has been used, while saving our fruit for export? 
</P>
<P>
The spraying of malathion over populated areas is a political act perpetuated 
by politicians in pursuit of agribusiness support. Unfortunately for them, the 
people have issued their own "health-risk assessment," and it is against 
malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian's decision not to run for reelection has rendered him 
impervious to the will of the people and he is able to impose the spraying. 
However, those who have been harmed by it will long remember the politicians, 
bureaucrats and physicians who conspired to injure them.

I wish to commend The Times for its editorial ("More Winners Make for Better 
Business," Aug. 20), which was critical of the lottery administration and its 
latest move to increase its "take." However, I would like to point out that 
your statement, "Does common sense say that you will attract more players if 
one person occasionally wins $40 million . . .," is not applicable to the 
lottery if it is referring to a jackpot winner. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you win $40 million, the state pockets the $40 million and pays 
you only 5% of that amount each year for 20 years. If the state wanted to 
invest that $40 million in, say U.S. Treasury notes paying over 8%, it could 
earn over 3% per year for the next 20 years and still end up with the $40 
million. Even if the state spends your $40 million immediately, it ends up with 
an obligation to you similar, in effect, to a 20-year municipal bond that pays 
5% interest per year for 20 years and zero principal at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, lottery officials with their latest gimmick to increase the odds to 
increase the jackpot, are firm believers in the old maxim "never give a sucker 
an even break."

A VOTE FOR ABE

<P>
Yes, we love Kermit and Miss Piggy, and have a special place in our hearts for 
Gonzo. But when that tall figure of Abraham Lincoln stands up to speak in a 
Disneyland auditorium, and a deep and dignified voice begins to resonate, well, 
it's practically goose-bump time for some people. 
</P>
<P>
"The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the 
American people, just now, are much in the want of one," the robot says, 
quoting one of five speeches given by President Lincoln between 1838 and 1864. 
"We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was moved to Disneyland from the 1964 New York World's Fair, the 
Lincoln exhibit has been one of the park's most enduring attractions. Millions 
of park visitors have listened to Lincoln's five-minute address, given 51 times 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as popular as other exhibits, but it's a sentimental favorite. That's 
why many people were upset at reports that Disneyland was thinking of removing 
the exhibit to make room for the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, Disneyland insists that talk of removing Mr. Lincoln from the 
park's Main Street home is decidedly premature. "We have not made a decision on 
Mr. Lincoln vis-a-vis the Muppets," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
That's good. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the Muppets are an adequate reason to remove this stirring exhibit. It 
is a useful way to put people in touch with American history. Now, as in 
Lincoln's time, we need something to remind us to keep searching for a good 
definition of liberty.

Van de Kamp has suppressed free speech and the truth by refusing to publish the

BUCKS FOR BEETHOVEN, NOT THE BIZARRE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTISTS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO SCANDALIZE THE BOURGEOIS. BUT NOT TO MAKE THEM PAY 
FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, Charles Krauthammer is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has wisely postponed until the fall the 
great kulturkampf over funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. The 
fight badly needs its August recess. It is hard to think of a debate in recent 
years that has generated more nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
For example: The bill to extend the life of the NEA is encumbered with 26 
amendments, including one that prohibits federally supported art from including 
"any part of an actual human embryo." At first I thought that must mean any 
artistic representation of the human embryo. But since no one could possibly be 
for banning that, it occurred to me that the author, California Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), means that one may not include an actual fetus in a 
piece of federally funded art (Why just federally funded? And why just art?). 
This idea wins the award for most bizarre anti-abortion legislation of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not just ax-grinding congressmen who have muddied the debate. 
Self-serving artists have risen mightily to protest a Jesse Helms-inspired 
provision in current law that bans the NEA from giving money to any work that 
might be deemed obscene. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is being threatened," cried Joseph Papp in a statement true to his 
name. "I feel like I'm living under McCarthyism or Stalinism," cried Karen 
Finley, the New York performance artist best known for smearing ("deftly" -- 
Newsweek) chocolate on her semi-nude body, a statement, it seems, against the 
degradation of women. "Censorship!" cries the art world in unison. And, of 
course, "First Amendment!" 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law. . . ." It does not say, 
"Congress shall subsidize." Restricting federal subsidies for art has as little 
to do with censorship as it does with abortion. No one is censoring anything. 
Artists have the right to unfettered expression. The only question is by what 
right they demand unfettered subsidy for their unfettered expression. 
</P>
<P>
Artists have every right to scandalize the bourgeois. However, when they demand 
that the bourgeois pay (with taxes) for that which scandalizes him, they go too 
far. The bourgeois has every right to say, through Congress, "I'll only 
support, say, music that is tonal and art that is not obscene." 
</P>
<P>
A free society allocates its resources through its democratic institutions in 
order to achieve some freely chosen public purposes and social goods. The idea 
that artists should have some special say in the allocation of goods that line 
their own pockets has no more validity than the same claim by the sugar lobby. 
The only difference is that the sugar lobby doesn't have the chutzpah to claim 
that its subsidies are a constitutional right. 
</P>
<P>
Artists have good reason, however, to insist that the NEA debate is about 
censorship and the First Amendment. They don't want -- they don't know how -- 
to talk about the real issue, which is public purposes and social goods. If 
they didn't talk about the First Amendment, they would have to explain why 
chocolate-smearing is entitled to a federal subsidy. In other words, they would 
have to defend the value of their art. Given what passes for art these days, 
they had rather not. 
</P>
<P>
It is because art has become so self-indulgently and vacuously defined that 
legislators run around trying to contain it at the edges. Now some Republicans 
are proposing to ban federal funding for art that "deliberately denigrate(s) 
the cultural heritage of the United States, its religious traditions, or racial 
or ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
One's initial reaction is to say, forget the whole enterprise. Get government 
completely out of the arts. No more absurd debates over how to restrict an 
activity that no one can adequately define. Do what you want, go into the 
marketplace and, if enough people think it is art and will support you, fine. 
Otherwise, try bus-driving. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sympathetic to this throw-up-your-hands approach. But I have a better idea. 
It comes from historian Gertrude Himmelfarb. Since no one can define art, let 
alone obscenity and racial insensitivity, and since no one really wants to cut 
off the local symphony orchestra, let's make a new rule: The NEA will support 
the reproduction and dissemination only of old, established art. Not a penny 
for anything new. 
</P>
<P>
Creativity? On your own time, at your own expense. But if you want to expose 
the good citizens of Tempe and Tupelo to the wonders of the past -- 
Rachmaninoff and Beethoven, Raphael and Rubens -- the American taxpayer will 
look sympathetically upon your request. 
</P>
<P>
The Himmelfarb Amendment. A great idea with not a chance of passage.

NO FREE FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Horace Strather, who has been driving buses in Los Angeles for 33 years and 
still likes his job, commented on the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District's new policy of free fares if the buses are late. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(I don't think there will) be a lot of free riders. I think the only places 
you'll find that will be affected will be the long-distance lines, where you 
have the long headways. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the city lines are geared to 6-to-10-minute (trips), and I don't 
think you're going to have many (schedule delays) there. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a bus breaks down, you still are going to be within that 12-to-14 
minute interval. Most major lines run a very good schedule. 
</P>
<P>
I think the idea is good, and it might make people feel a little better about 
(riding the bus), but I think most people -- especially working people -- they 
are not concerned with saving money (in this particular area). They're just 
concerned with getting where they want to go on time. I don't foresee (free 
fares), although I see a bunch of youngsters in certain areas who will try it 
for a while just to keep from paying the fare.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN WOOLLACOTT, Martin Woollacott has for many years written about the 
Middle East for the Guardian of London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I write, I have before me a letter from a distinguished and charming 
Palestinian writer and film-maker. He speaks excellent English, was educated in 
the West, and his many children have made homes and careers in Britain, America 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all concerned," his letter begins, "about the feelings and worries of 
the families of the so-called foreign guests" -- and then it goes on to justify 
their detention. 
</P>
<P>
"This move is for peace rather than in the direction of war. First, it 
frustrates superior power to dictate what should be the object of rational 
negotiations. Second, it tries to move the common people in the West into 
thinking and applying pressure on politicians. . . . Finally, the move gives 
time to everybody to re-think the whole thing again." 
</P>
<P>
The letter continues with a long quotation from the Koran and ends, "I do pray 
for all the victims, and pray that the politicians will awaken to the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Outrage is one's immediate reaction. How can a civilized man endorse 
hostage-taking in this way? How can he, and many others, go along with the 
sickly euphemism that turns prisoners into guests? 
</P>
<P>
It is hard for us to grasp a moral universe in which the use of hostages is 
acceptable, but many Arabs, and not only in Jordan and Palestine, do see it 
that way. One reason is that the Middle East does not share our habit of 
looking at a deed in isolation and awarding it the character of bad or good. 
There, an action is seen within a vast context -- of grievances both immediate 
and historical, of other evils and injustices, of pain endured in the past and 
pain to be endured in the future. Chains of consequences are calculated or 
imagined, and only then can the whole significance of a particular act be 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
As American forces mass against Iraq, Arabs see above all that the West is able 
to inflict pain without suffering much pain itself. The civilians of Iraq, and 
perhaps of Jordan and Israel, will be in the front line, while those of the 
West will be safely watching the war on television, hundreds or thousands of 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner the other night, an Arab businesswoman blazed with anger at the 
insouciance with which Western newspapers print maps bristling with tank and 
aircraft symbols and likely missile targets. The West was treating this as a 
war game, while at home in Amman her 8- and 10-year-old sons were sleeping, and 
each morning she woke up convinced the war had begun, and the bombs and the 
missiles would soon be falling. The most the West was worried about was the 
price of petrol and the collapse of the stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
Your children are not going to be bombed, she said, so you cannot feel as we 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing stopping the West from looking at everything she'd loved and 
valued as a disposable item on the war-game board, she implied, was the 
presence of so many Westerners in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to try to justify Saddam Hussein's action, most inhabitants of his 
world do not express wholehearted approval, but they want to explain how this 
wrong -- the use of Western civilians in this way -- fits into a whole series 
of other wrongs, most of them by the West against the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
The first line of argument usually is that the West's determination to continue 
to control the Arab world is a great wrong from which other wrongs spring -- 
including evils wrought by Arabs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The same reasoning is encountered in discussion of Saddam Hussein's brutal 
record at home in Iraq. Even if it is accepted that the West's motivation in 
moving against him is far from pure, you may say, should he not be stopped 
simply because he is the worst kind of dictator? Few Jordanians or Palestinians 
would agree. "Saddam's character is about No. 22 on my list of worries at this 
moment," said the same businesswoman from Amman. It is Iraq that is going to be 
attacked, Arabs argue, Iraq whose back is going to be broken. Saddam's 
Hussein's record is incidental to that. 
</P>
<P>
The plain refusal to face facts is hard for a Westerner to swallow. Jordan, for 
instance, has a leader -- King Hussein -- who in nearly 40 years of rule has 
killed only a handful of political opponents, and those legally. Saddam Hussein 
has killed as many over a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Prison or exile have been the maximum penalties for political opposition in 
Jordan, and those used with restraint. Plotters, dissidents and critics have 
been pardoned, given jobs, pensions, sinecures. 
</P>
<P>
It has been autocracy tempered by kindness and, from time to time, by elements 
of genuine democracy. Yet Jordanians seem to repudiate this gentle tradition 
when they endorse, as some of them do, Saddam Hussein and all his works. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing with one left-wing journalist from Jordan whose equivalents in Iraq 
have long since been purged, I said, "If you were an Iraqi, you would be dead." 
He did not demur, but carried right on with his arguments in support of Saddam 
Hussein. That a triumphant Saddam might achieve such influence over Jordan as 
to control him and his future -- if he would then have one -- did not seem to 
concern him. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Arabs resemble Europeans and Americans in many ways. They watch the 
same films, wear the same clothes, aspire to the same material way of life. But 
a great difference remains, and a situation like this reveals its extent. 
</P>
<P>
Where we see only the dictator, they see that they are once again being 
dictated to by the West. Where we see a threat to the world order, they see a 
threat to our world order, an order that has never favored them. Where we see a 
threat to the oil that fuels the world economy, they see a threat not to oil, 
but to Western control of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Where we see one bully, they see two -- Saddam Hussein and George Bush. Where 
we see a war in which the West will prevail, they see their cities destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
So when Arabs watch British children on television at the side of an ominously 
jovial Saddam Hussein, they see the unfairness and injustice of the situation. 
But they see it alongside other images -- of the intifada's many dead, and of 
their own children now at risk in the wider war that threatens, and at risk in 
a way that children in London and Paris and New York are not. 
</P>
<P>
The moral laxity that can excuse Saddam Hussein must be confronted. But our 
easy habit of looking only at the morality of a particular issue, while 
ignoring the broader context, is also a kind of dishonesty.

Concert Crashers: A group of about 40 youths scaled gates at the Shoreline 
Amphitheater in Mountain View, Calif., during a performance Friday by the rap 
group Public Enemy and randomly assaulted concertgoers and security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty people were treated for minor injuries at the venue's first-aid 
stations, said police Lt. Gary Smith. Victims told police that they believed 
the attackers were members of a gang, but Smith said no gang affiliation had 
been confirmed. The assaults, which took place in the plaza surrounding the 
amphitheater, apparently did not disrupt the concert attended by 8,000 people.

Bandit Stops News: WLS-TV in Chicago returned to broadcasting Sunday after 
nearly nine hours of dead air caused by the search for a pizzeria bandit who 
slipped into the station's building. 
</P>
<P>
It was "business as usual" for the ABC station once it resumed broadcasting at 
7 a.m. after three searches of its location failed to locate the gunman, 
General Manager Joe Ahern said. The station was evacuated just before 
Saturday's 10 p.m. newscast. The gunman, suspected in a robbery Saturday of a 
Chicago pizzeria, was fleeing police when he entered the building housing the 
studios. BETH KLEID

KAVAKOS BRINGS FIREWORKS TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Tchaikovsky Spectacular at Hollywood Bowl is thoroughly familiar, 
and everyone knows what familiarity breeds. But over the years the beloved old 
pyromaniac's delight has also created the cheering expectation of musical 
fireworks in the pre-intermission concerto spot. 
</P>
<P>
Such anticipation was rewarded again in the latest enactment of the ritual, 
courtesy of young Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos. In his Bowl debut, he 
applied rousing sound, potent technique and an interpretation of occasionally 
disconcerting eccentricity to the Violin Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Kavakos began slowly, with the odd mixture of deliberation and dreamy eloquence 
that characterized his approach to the lyrical material. In the bravura 
conflagrations he proved technically precise, but his phrasing and bowing were 
sufficiently idiosyncratic to lose conductor Gerard Schwarz and the supporting 
Seattle Symphony at times in the first movement. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Kavakos produced a big-sounding, emotionally engaging performance. 
Schwarz backed him with generally lithe, balanced and pertinently detailed 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz and his visiting orchestra had to themselves the familiar charms of the 
Polonaise from "Eugene Onegin" and the "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy. The 
Polonaise danced blithely enough, and the ensemble's lean, dark sound -- 
illuminated by gleaming brass -- and articulate rhythmicality projected much of 
the drama of the tone poem. But Schwarz somehow left "Romeo and Juliet" overall 
a prosaic, unconnected experience of surprisingly low energy. 
</P>
<P>
In the increasingly anticlimactic "1812" Overture, Schwarz's company was 
enlarged by the USC Trojan Band. The orchestra dispatched the introductory 
solemnities with minimal rhetoric, and the assembled throng accompanied the 
fireworks diligently. JOHN HENKEN

20TH-CENTURY WORKS FEATURED AT LA JOLLA CHAMBER FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chamber music may be rarefied and elitist in its mystique, but audiences for 
the genre respond in the same ways other crowds do: Virtuosity is applauded, 
musicality appreciated, charisma admired and glamour rewarded. Not necessarily 
in that order. 
</P>
<P>
All these virtues popped up, at one time or another, in the two weekend 
concerts of SummerFest '90, the annual August celebration of the La Jolla 
Chamber Music Society. But in combination with negative elements: oddball 
programming, some low-energy performances, as well as unfocused playing and 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
There were some novel aspects in both the Friday and Saturday night concerts in 
Sherwood Auditorium at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Heiichiro Ohyama, artistic director of the fest through its five-year history, 
sprinkled music by 20th-Century composers into these two programs: Bruce 
Adolphe's Quartet for oboe and strings (1978), Edgard Varese's "Density 21.5" 
and two works by Andre Previn, his "Peaches" for flute and piano (1974) and 
Five Songs on Poems of Philip Larkin (1978). 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, in his spoken program notes, Previn himself, disparaging the 
title composer-in-residence Ohyama bestowed upon him this summer, promised a 
receptive audience some more recent works of his composition if he is invited 
back. Nevertheless, the two pieces from the 1970s heard Saturday proved highly 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
As played by Carol Wincenc, "Peaches" turned out to be an affecting, languorous 
and savory lullaby -- in D, with pungent chromatic accents -- a five-minute 
reverie that sings but never cloys. At the piano, the composer became an ideal 
partner for flutist Wincenc. 
</P>
<P>
As downbeat as "Peaches" is upbeat, the five Larkin songs reach the listener 
through pointed word-setting and a musical subtext of considerable potency. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Cairns, familiar in Southern California through regular visits with 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, seemed less than well-cast in this assignment: 
Her characteristically handsome, even mezzo-soprano appeared effortful, her 
control of vocal detail unsteady. Still, with pianist Previn guiding the way, 
the singer made much of the quiet dramatic points in this touching suite. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Saturday performance emerged a splendid exhibit of virtuosity. 
At the end, pianist David Golub displayed his chops in an irrepressible 
run-through of Mendelssohn's early Sextet for piano and strings, Opus 110. Even 
the most jaded chamber-music aficionado might have dropped his jaws at Golub's 
flying 32nd-notes and octave runs -- all of his technical feats accomplished 
with a clairvoyant musicality. 
</P>
<P>
Wincenc, another deservedly acclaimed wizard of technique and tone, opened the 
program with Debussy's "Syrinx" and the Varese piece, giving in both an object 
lesson in resourceful, pertinent music-making. 
</P>
<P>
Despite clever programming -- two novel eight-minute pieces before 
intermission, and Brahms' big Sextet, Opus 36, after -- the Friday-night 
concert failed to rouse the listener above a pleasantly somnolent state. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in the G-major Sextet was a failure of leadership. All six players 
-- violinists Franco Gulli and Robert Chen, violists Cynthia Phelps and 
Francesca Martin, cellists Carter Brey and Gary Hoffman -- played 
conscientiously and in careful balance. But no strong musical thread held this 
performance together; it merely moved along. 
</P>
<P>
Adolphe's brief Oboe Quartet, played by Gerard Reuter, with violinist Deborah 
Redding, violist Martin and cellist Diane Chaplin, is a charmer, a wistful, 
melancholy piece in the contemporary style of Geoffrey Burgon's deservedly 
admired score to "Brideshead Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
At mid-program, mezzo Cairns was joined by pianist Golub and a string quartet 
in Chausson's ironic "Chanson Perpetuelle" in a performance of generalized 
emotions, questionable intonation and missing textual point. Those listeners 
who had not encountered the work before ought to be told: It's better than this 
reading would lead you to believe.

NOTES PROVE HARD TO CARRY IN 'MOTOWN REVUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early '60s, Motown Records helped launch the careers of newcomers like 
Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, the Miracles and Marvin Gaye by giving them 
exposure and performing experience in traveling revues. The '90s version of 
that concept, "The Motortown Revue," rolled into the Hollywood Palladium on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who saw those early Motown revues can see that this one, featuring 
Motown's crop of new artists, is comparatively minor-league. Though the show's 
major acts -- the Boys, Today, the Good Girls -- have had hit records, none 
seem unusually talented. Singers like Gaye and the Supremes were impressive and 
loaded with star quality even as rookies. 
</P>
<P>
The new revue included six acts performing sets lasting between 15 minutes and 
a half-hour. All were backed by musicians except the rappers who, of course, 
were accompanied by taped tracks. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most talented artist was Milira, a 19-year-old gospel/R&amp;B 
singer. But her style could use some toning down and fine tuning, and she was 
hampered by lame material. 
</P>
<P>
Rapper Rich Nice was backed by some potent music tracks but his delivery was 
woefully weak. The trouble with female rapper M.C. Trouble was that her 
mile-a-minute delivery made her lyrics unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a male vocal quartet, spent too much time trying to be cool and sexy -- 
playing the teasing playboys. If they want to live up to their billing as the 
next Temptations they'd better learn to sing on key consistently. The Good 
Girls, touted as the new Supremes, are known for their remake of their 
forerunners' "Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart." They performed 
energetically but sang erratically. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the crowd at the Palladium, which slowly filled up during the nearly 
three-hour show, was pre-teen, and clearly was there to see the Boys, whose 
half-hour set closed the show. Though cute and poised, the four young Compton 
brothers now based in Northridge are not the reincarnation of the Jackson 5. 
These youngsters can barely carry a tune. They weren't impressive, except to 
the young females who regarded them as swoon-bait.DENNIS HUNT

HAYNES IS IN FINE VOICE AT GIORGIO'S; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE APPEALING SINGER PUTS TOGETHER A PERFORMANCE THAT SHOULD FIND A WIDER 
AUDIENCE. 
</P>

<P>
Stephanie Haynes is one very appealing singer. 
</P>
<P>
She has a marvelous voice, a warm, personable alto that's distinctively her 
own. She chooses terrific tunes which she performs terrifically, remaining true 
to the songs' emotional intentions and musical constructs, yet not reluctant to 
nudge them this way or that to suit her feel-free-to-fool-around jazz-based 
rhythmic concept. She enunciates clearly, so you can hear every word and she's 
got a dandy ear that keeps the pitch right on target and handles a modulation 
from A flat to G with nary a slip. 
</P>
<P>
Friday in the cozy back room of Giorgio's Place (located at the base of the 
Arco Towers in Long Beach, where singers and trios have been the call for a few 
months), Haynes brought along all the above qualities and, backed by her 
regular accompanists -- pianist Larry Flahive and bassist Jack Prather -- gave 
listeners there an aural treat. 
</P>
<P>
The medium-plus tempoed "The Best Thing for You Would Be Me" proved to be a 
lively opener that displayed Haynes' horn-like approach in her rhythmic 
choices, and found Flahive soloing with spritely repeated attacks of a single 
note, bluesy phrases and lines that constantly curved. A slight bossa nova 
feeling underpinned the subsequent "Deep in a Dream," and led to Jerome Kern's 
"I'm Old-Fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
This evergreen, which was done as colorfully as the purple print dress with a 
black-and-silver-sequin-embroidered shoulders that Haynes wore, found the 
singer extending some of her phrases like pulled taffy, so that a word such as 
"rain" became "ray -- aa -- ain" and "fancies," as in 'passing,' became 
"fan-seeeees." On still other passages her words were separated as crisply as 
the texture of fresh cucumber slices. 
</P>
<P>
Flahive and Prather offered ever-at-the-ready support for Haynes, and scored 
with three opening duo tunes, among them "For All We Know," where the pianist 
caressed the melody as if he were slow dancing with his one-and-only. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes is a rare vocalist and in a area that is known for its fine singers. She 
should be heard more often.

Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia are building a cocaine empire in Western 
European countries, which have replaced the United States as the biggest market 
for the drug, Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported, citing a joint study by 
the international police organization Interpol and the Colombian intelligence 
police. The Bogota offices of both Interpol and the intelligence police were 
closed Sunday, and no one could be reached for comment. The European market 
will continue to grow because of the Italian Mafia's intention to preserve its 
distribution monopoly and the Colombian cartels' desire to capture part of the 
market, according to the study.

About 1,000 Manila police officers rallied to protest army rebel involvement in 
a rash of bombings across the country. Unarmed officers in civilian clothes, 
carrying placards reading "Damn the coup plotters," "Bombers are so crazy" and 
"Damn you, bombers," staged a march at dawn to a public park in Manila. They 
were joined by about 2,000 others in chanting slogans against the army rebels, 
who have attempted six coups against President Corazon Aquino in the past four 
years.

About 300 anti-government demonstrators occupied a central square in Bucharest, 
Romania, a day after 48 people were arrested and two reportedly hurt in a clash 
with police there. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents demanded the resignation of President Ion Iliescu. Critics accuse 
Iliescu and his associates, who won free elections earlier this year, of 
keeping many of the policies of the authoritarian Communist leader Nicolae 
Ceausescu, who was executed after his regime was toppled. The protesters at 
University Square, located at the main intersection on the capital's 
fashionable Balcescu Boulevard, disrupted traffic and forced motorists to use 
side streets.

Protesters opposed to the hunting of Tule elk said eight demonstrators were 
arrested during a weekend confrontation with authorities on a bridge to the 
Grizzly Island wildlife area. Police were barring demonstrators from using the 
bridge to reach the island, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Animal 
Law said. 
</P>
<P>
The group said it was protesting the killing of 30 Tule elk. In all, 26 
protesters have been arrested during the three-week campaign against the 
hunting, which the group said it has been protesting for several years. The 
foundation said it intends to go to court to challenge the latest arrests on 
grounds that only protesters were denied passage to the island. About 60 
demonstrators were met by about 50 officers of the state Department of Fish and 
Game and the Solano County Sheriff's Department, the group added.

LEARNING MORE ABOUT HUMANS FROM SHARKS;

<P>
RESEARCH: THE CREATURES HAVE AN UNUSUAL RESISTANCE TO MANY HUMAN DISEASES, 
INCLUDING CANCER. SCIENTISTS ARE SEEKING CLUES TO THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Before dense jungles covered the land, long before the Earth's continents moved 
apart, and millions of years before the first amphibians crawled out of the 
sea, there were sharks. More than 400 million years ago, they were already 
stalking prey in the Earth's warm, enormous primordial sea. 
</P>
<P>
Sharks are among the most fabled and feared of the Earth's creatures, and the 
subject of both popular lore and considerable misconception. They have survived 
several mysterious mass extinctions of ocean life and have outlived most other 
fish in the sea, except for a few ancient oddities, like hagfish and lampreys. 
From an evolutionary viewpoint they are one of the most successful creatures 
the world has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long regarded the shark as a living link to the marine origins 
of vertebrates, and recent studies of the shark immune system have shown it to 
be unlike that of any other animal. The discovery is considered a tantalizing 
clue to the evolution and workings of the mammalian immune system, a better 
understanding of which could ultimately benefit those working to combat various 
immune-system disorders in humans. 
</P>
<P>
But the work also promises insights into the evolutionary process in general 
and a better explanation of why sharks seem to have unusual resistance to a 
number of diseases, including cancer. This latter fact has been known for more 
than 25 years and continues to be the subject of a few isolated, long-term 
research efforts aimed at developing a treatment for human cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The recent immune-system studies were done at several marine laboratories in 
Florida and New York, where researchers are working with sharks, skates and 
rays, all of which occupy the same taxonomic subclass, called elasmobranchs. 
Compared to the immune systems of mammals and birds, which have received the 
most scrutiny so far, the elasmobranch immune system appears primitive but 
remarkably effective and highly adapted to its environment, according to 
Michael Sigel, who did pioneering work on the shark immune system at the 
University of Miami in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Immunity seems to be much more effective in the shark than in man, horse or 
other mammals," said Sigel, now chairman emeritus of the department of 
microbiology and immunology at the University of South Carolina Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
A properly working immune system keeps its host alive by combating disease and 
infection. It does this by identifying antigens -- potentially harmful foreign 
substances, mainly proteins -- in the body and mounting an attack against them. 
</P>
<P>
In humans and other mammals, a two-part system has evolved. One part, called 
the cell-mediated response, or T-cell immunity, eliminates cells with antigens 
on their surfaces. A virus-infected cell, for example, has viral protein (a 
form of antigen) on its surface, which initiates a cell-mediated response. 
</P>
<P>
The other part of the immune system is the humoral antibody response, or B-cell 
immunity, which deals directly with antigens by releasing antibodies into the 
blood. These antibodies are other kinds of proteins that attach themselves to 
the antigen, either destroying it directly or enabling other cells to destroy 
it by ingestion. In humans, there are millions of possible antibodies, which 
fall within five classes, known as immunoglobulins. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, Sigel found that sharks have a peculiar immunoglobulin 
molecule called IgM that offers unusually versatile protection. Sigel later 
found that a large amount of the IgM is always circulating in sharks and ready 
to act. "It always seems ready to attack anything in sight," Sigel said. In 
humans, on the other hand, the immune system is normally dormant, turning 
itself "on" in response to antigens. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in the IgM discovery, Sigel established an interesting link 
between humans and sharks: human fetuses have mostly IgM immunoglobulin at 
first, and begin producing the other forms later on. Sigel interprets this 
coincidence as an example of "ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny," or the 
development of an individual organism reflecting evolution itself. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists believe that through evolution, the human immune system became 
complex and extremely flexible in order to cope with the huge number of 
different antigens that it must respond to. Every one of these antigens prompts 
a different set of antibodies, so B-cell immunity depends on a fabulous 
diversity of antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
In virtually all animals, the very first wave of antibodies that responds to an 
antigen is IgM. But during this first response, some antibodies undergo a 
mutation that refines and improves the way they bind to that particular 
antigen. The next time the immune system encounters the antigen, it mounts a 
quicker and more effective attack based on a higher class of antibodies called 
IgG or IgA. 
</P>
<P>
But since sharks cannot make these higher antibodies, they never experience an 
improved, or memorized, second immune response. Multiple exposures to the same 
antigen merely produce essentially the same response over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, after the role of genetics in the mammalian immune system 
was uncovered, Gary W. Litman and Kristin R. Hinds at the Sloan-Kettering 
Institute for Cancer Research in Rye, N.Y., began exploring the antibody-gene 
system of the horned shark, which is found mainly in the Pacific off Southern 
California. The evolutionary line including sharks diverged from the line 
extending to mammals as many as 450 million years ago, and Litman and Hinds 
were looking for clues to the immune systems that existed at the time of that 
divergence. 
</P>
<P>
What they found exceeded expectations. "At every twist and turn of evolution, 
we have documented evidence in this laboratory that there were sometimes major 
differences in the way that antibody genes were organized and functioned," said 
Litman, now at the University of South Florida, in a recent interview. "That 
came very much to our surprise." 
</P>
<P>
For example, sharks do not have nearly the variety of gene segments that humans 
have, so their immune system is less flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Litman says he and Hinds have found some evidence in sharks of antibody 
mutation, but it is not at all like the mammalian process that lays the 
foundation for a much-improved secondary response to an antigen. 
</P>
<P>
To Litman, the shark immune system is evidence that "evolution doesn't always 
work in a continuous way to improve. At some departure, a type or form may 
appear that doesn't have to work anywhere else in evolution." 
</P>
<P>
The shark's system, he notes, is less sophisticated than man's, "but perhaps it 
leaves less to chance. Maybe it stayed less complicated because it doesn't need 
capabilities like those of a higher, land-bound system." 
</P>
<P>
Litman's theory is supported by past findings that the shark immune system 
seems to do an extraordinary job of protecting against cancer and other 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
More recent research in this area has focused on the ability of shark cartilage 
to inhibit tumor growth. Tumors need a large blood supply to survive, and it 
has been known for years that cartilage of all kinds -- whether from mammals or 
fish -- has no blood vessels, and indeed contains substances that prevent the 
formation of new blood vessels. For studies of this phenomenon, the shark is 
the ideal laboratory animal: It is cartilaginous from head to tail, without a 
bone in its body. 
</P>
<P>
Carl A. Luer, a senior scientist at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla., 
has been working in this area since 1979. Having shown that a group of proteins 
from shark cartilage does in fact inhibit blood-vessel growth, Luer is now 
trying to isolate the specific proteins involved and compare their 
effectiveness with proteins from mammalian cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, he narrowed the group of proteins from eight to three. His 
long-term goal is to identify, in these proteins, one or more active molecules 
that might lead to a tumor treatment lacking the harmful side effects of 
current treatments like radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In related experiments, Luer has been trying to induce tumors in hundreds of 
clear-nose skates and nurse sharks (the only ones being kept as laboratory 
animals in the United States, Luer says). He has tried two chemicals known to 
cause cancer in human beings and other species. But he has not yet been able to 
cause a tumor in either a skate or a shark. 
</P>
<P>
This comes as no surprise to Churchill McKinney of the University of Miami 
School of Medicine, another expert on shark immunity. "Whatever causes cancer 
in human beings probably does not cause cancer in sharks," she said. Although 
skeptical of claims of extraordinary immunity in sharks, McKinney hopes that 
studies of the elasmobranch immune system may help researchers trying to 
understand mammalian immune systems, particularly humans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Human Immunity 
</P>
<P>
When the human immune system senses the arrival of microorganisms -- identified 
by surface proteins called antigens -- it produces two types of white blood 
cells, or lymphocytes. (1) T-cells orchestrate the immune response, releasing 
chemical signals that activate the inflmmatory response. Some also become 
killer cells that ingest and destroy the invaders. (2) B-cells secrete 
antibodies that bind to the antigens and target them for destruction. (3) 
"Memory" B-cells, sensitized to that invader, remain in the circulation to ward 
off future attacks, making the patient imune. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shark Immunity 
</P>
<P>
The shark's immune system works differently. It does not produce specific 
antibodies against each intruder. Instead, an immunoglobulin molecule called 
IgM constantly circulates in the shark's blood, binding to foreign antigens and 
marking them for destruction. Because the shark does not make antibodies, they 
do not become immune after an infection. Instead, the same immune response 
begins afresh with each new infection.

READING DISABILITIES MISLABELED

<TEXT>
<P>
Schools are up to four times more likely to label boys as reading-disabled than 
they are girls. But when standard research criteria are used to diagnose 
reading disability, the problem is found to occur about equally in both sexes, 
scientists reported last week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Yale University and the University of Texas evaluated 445 
Connecticut schoolchildren whose intelligence, behavior and academic progress 
were regularly assessed from kindergarten through the third grade. When reading 
disability was defined as a discrepancy between IQ and performance on a reading 
test, it was found in about 9% of second- and third-grade boys and in 6% to 7% 
of girls -- not a statistically significant difference. But teachers identified 
10% to 14% of boys in those grades as reading-disabled, compared to only 3% to 
4% of girls. 
</P>
<P>
Children whom schools considered reading-disabled but whose tests did not 
confirm the diagnosis were significantly more likely than average to show 
behavior problems. Conversely, children whose tests indicated a reading 
disability but who had been "missed" by schools were significantly less likely 
than average to be classroom troublemakers.

DUST MITES LINKED TO ASTHMA

<TEXT>
<P>
Exposure to house-dust mites during infancy appears to be an important cause of 
childhood asthma in places where the climate is humid year-round, researchers 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. University of 
Virginia scientists based the study on a survey of 67 children in humid Poole, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers checked for house-dust mites by testing samples of dust from 
their homes. By age 11, 17 children had asthma. All but one had been exposed to 
high levels of house-dust mites at age 1. 
</P>
<P>
The work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins from common 
household creatures, especially cats and cockroaches, can trigger asthma. It 
also suggests that modern home construction, including insulation and central 
heating, is raising the risk of asthma. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitant of houses everywhere, 
especially in places with year-round humid climates. In the study, children had 
an elevated risk if the house dust in their homes contained 500 or more mites 
per gram. Children whose asthma is triggered by house-dust mites are allergic 
to a form of a protein found in the mites' gastrointestinal tracts and 
droppings.

Exhaust from space shuttle and other rocket launches makes the government one 
of the biggest contributors to ozone depletion, an environmental group charged 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Each launch of the space shuttle or the Air Force's Titan IV does more to 
deplete the fragile ozone layer . . . than the annual ground-level emissions of 
chlorofluorocarbons from most individual (industrial) plants," the report by 
the National Toxics Campaign Fund of Boston said. 
</P>
<P>
Shuttle launches are exempt from air safety regulations, and unless they can be 
brought into compliance, NASA should be forced to abandon solid rocket fuel, 
the report said. Space shuttles and Titan IV rockets are propelled by solid 
rocket fuel, which produces exhaust that causes environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
The European Space Agency's Ariane rocket and the Soviet Energia rocket use 
liquid fuel, which the report said is less damaging.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS SPORT OFFERS FUN IN THE SUN AND A LOT MORE

<P>
Usually I don't go to the beach to look at guys. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I was one of the 25,000 or more who spent Sunday afternoon 
sunning at Hermosa Beach, watching some of the hottest mister sandmen in the 
world competing in one of the hottest outdoor sports in the world, pro beach 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the Miller Lite USA Championships, an event that has grown and 
grown to the point that the winning partnership of Sinjin Smith and Randy 
Stoklos stuffed $41,000 into their trunks. It was the best time any two people 
have had in the sand since Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
What we have here is a cult sport that is in the process of being discovered. 
And believe me, the popularity of beach-ball is extending far beyond our 
Southern California shores and all our suntan-oily volley boys and volley 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
Two-on-two beach volleyball will be a demonstration sport at the 1992 Barcelona 
Olympics, with a shot at being sanctioned as a medal sport for '96. So, if you 
know any kids who can't afford football or golf equipment, tell them there's a 
lucrative activity where all they need to bring in the way of equipment is sun 
block. 
</P>
<P>
Certain people might be slow catching up with this form of volleyball. Maybe 
they don't even realize that beach volleyball has become a lot more than just 
an alternative to playing with a Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
Total prize money at Hermosa came to $200,000, richest in the history of the 
tournament. When the first world championships of beach volleyball were staged 
at Pacific Palisades in 1976, the entire purse amounted to a crummy $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
So, who said there ain't no cure for the summertime blues? Not me, babes and 
dudes. I had an excellent time Sunday, watching all the booms, clamps, facials 
and kongs at the net, not to mention a couple of beautiful dinks just when I 
thought the dude was about to deliver a heater. 
</P>
<P>
(And I'll bet you thought I didn't know this stuff.) 
</P>
<P>
About the only disappointment was that I went the whole day without once 
spotting Annette Funicello, who usually hangs out in these places. She must 
have been home making peanut-butter sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
At least Toni Ayabarreno of Long Beach was there, to present first prize to the 
winners. As major sporting events go, this could be the only one that also 
conducts a beauty contest. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was there, too, to tape the matches for showing next Saturday. I'll 
probably watch them again, because it was the most fun I've had since my daddy 
took my T-bird away. 
</P>
<P>
There was an absolutely super semifinal match that pitted two Olympic gold 
medalists, Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons, on opposite sides. 
</P>
<P>
The sand was so hot that Kiraly and his partner, Brent Frohoff from Loyola 
Marymount, elected to wear socks. Not shoes, just socks. Meanwhile, Timmons and 
his partner, Adam Johnson from USC, were even hotter, taking a 12-8 lead and 
nearly pulling off a nice upset before Kiraly and Frohoff rallied. 
</P>
<P>
What it got them was a shot in the finals at Smith and Stoklos, the UCLA alums 
who are more or less the Pam Shriver and Martina Navratilova of this pastime, a 
doubles pair that doesn't often lose. Smith, 33, is the winningest player in 
the history of beach volleyball and Stoklos, 29, is the sport's two-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also has a little John McEnroe in him. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing a finger and striding out of his sandbox toward a section of 
spectators in his too-cool upturned visor, Smith demanded: "Have your friends 
quiet down over there!" 
</P>
<P>
It turned part of the crowd against him, but what the heck, the sport needs all 
the personalities it can get. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher St. John Smith definitely puts on a good show, as evidenced by his 
decision to go to a "skyball" serve on match point -- sort of an eephus pitch 
that he lobs about 75 feet into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Sinjin got that final point, giving another title to the tag team from the 
Palisades, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
In certain corners of the world, South America and Europe in particular, some 
of these top-gun volleyballers are mobbed and fawned over like movie stars. 
They rate right up there with soccer players in popularity -- and, better 
still, you almost never hear of anybody being killed during a 
volleyball-stadium riot. 
</P>
<P>
Matter of fact, these volleyball guys really understand what a beach crowd 
likes. 
</P>
<P>
When the match was over, Smith thanked everybody for coming and for having a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
Then Stoklos said: "OK, everybody go out now and have a beer!" 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Maybe I'd better start covering more sporting events at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The only part I didn't like was when the game got interrupted because a 
baseball got loose.

out of the game . . . 
</P>
<P>
He changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst was staying in. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since becoming manager of the Padres seven weeks ago, 
Riddoch went to the mound without asking for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect to see that occurrence again any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Riddoch was slumped on the bench, watching Larry Walker hit a 
three-run homer over the right-field fence off Hurst, leaving the Padres with a 
4-2 defeat to the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Tony (Gwynn) going back, and back," Riddoch said, "and I really thought 
he had a chance to catch it against the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The next feeling I had was my heart bouncing off the bottom of my stomach. 
And, believe me, that's the worst feeling in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat in front of the crowd of 27,650 at Olympic Stadium was almost a 
carbon copy of opening day, which actually sent Hurst (8-9) into a tailspin 
from which he has yet to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
It was on a sunny afternoon April 9 at Dodger Stadium when Hurst took a 2-1 
lead into the eighth inning, put two runners on base, was allowed to stay in 
the game and promptly gave up a three-run homer to Hubie Brooks, resulting in a 
4-2 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of vanishing, the ugly trend has only flourished. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have lost five games this season in the sixth inning or later on 
home runs allowed by Hurst, each time wiping out at least a one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn how to win games," Hurst said, "and I haven't learned how to 
so well this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the part that's disappointing because it's all my fault. I'm the one 
responsible. I'm the one who threw the pitch. I'm the one who let everyone 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hurst had plenty of help in losing this one, starting with dreadful 
offense, negligent defense and a manager who wishes he had stuck with his own 
gut feeling. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres somehow had survived all of their mental and physical mistakes, with 
Hurst bailing them out time after time, but in the eighth, everything unraveled 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Noboa led off with a sharp ground ball in the hole, and shortstop Garry 
Templeton was only able to stop it, without making a play. Tim Raines followed 
with a ground-ball single almost to the same location. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris and Craig Lefferts were feverishly warming up, and when they saw 
Riddoch walk to the mound, they figured that Harris was coming in to face 
right-handed hitters Tim Wallach and Andre Galarraga and that Lefferts would 
face left-handed Walker, then finish out the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
That indeed was the plan . . . temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I went out to take him out," Riddoch said, "but when I did, my 
stomach told me, 'Hey, we got the perfect matchup. He's going to get these guys 
out.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Riddoch went to the mound, instead of asking for the ball, he fooled 
everyone by saying, "How are we going to get them out?" 
</P>
<P>
Hurst: "We'll fork(-ball) them to death." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch went back to the bench actually feeling good about his decision. He 
knows as well as anyone that Hurst is tougher on right-handed hitters (.220) 
than lefties (.276), and between Wallach, Galarraga and Walker, they had 
combined to hit just two balls out of the infield the entire day. 
</P>
<P>
When Wallach hit a shallow fly ball to center for the first out, and Galarraga 
struck out on three pitches for the second, Riddoch remembers sitting in the 
dugout, thinking, "This has worked out perfect; where can I pat myself on the 
back?" 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Walker, who struck out twice and lined out to right in his first 
three at-bats against Hurst, and was mired in a seven-for-46 slump (.152). 
</P>
<P>
"We had him so fooled his last time up," Padre catcher Mark Parent said, "that 
we were sure he'd just look at the first pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Walker saw a forkball fluttering over the plate, a little bit inside 
and a tad high. 
</P>
<P>
It looked good enough to Walker. He hit a towering fly ball that looked 
immediately as if it would barely stay inside the fence, or just clear it. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think it was going over," Gwynn said. "I was getting ready to 
make the play, but I couldn't, because the thing went over the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The home run left Hurst, who was 3-0 with a 1.17 ERA in his last six starts, 
with his first defeat since July 19. But, of course, when your offense has 
scored just eight runs in the past 52 innings against the Expos, you've got big 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those outings were against Kevin Gross (8-10), who not only has gone 11 
consecutive starts without winning a game, he entered the game having allowed 
19 earned runs in his past 20 innings. 
</P>
<P>
So what do the Padres do? 
</P>
<P>
They knocked Gross around for nine hits and obtained two walks. But when he 
left after five innings, the Padres had only a 2-1 lead to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't let a pitcher like Gross get away like that," Parent said. "When you 
got a guy struggling like that, you've got to take advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Padres, in particular second baseman Roberto Alomar, made it as 
difficult as possible for Hurst. In the first inning, Alomar failed to throw 
home on a pickoff play, allowing Marquis Grissom to score. In the seventh 
inning, he dropped a throw from first baseman Phil Stephenson, putting runners 
at second and third with no outs. And in the ninth he ended the game by 
grounding into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the teams who win all the time," Riddoch said, "there are reasons 
for their success. Those are the teams that do the little things right, who 
execute the fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're not one of those teams." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays, according to sources, are interested in acquiring Padre 
pitcher Eric Show in exchange for one or two prospects from their minor-league 
system. The Blue Jays shunned earlier advances by the Padres concerning Show, 
but according to Blue Jay club officials, have had a change of heart and are 
interested in acquiring him before the Aug. 31 deadline when playoff rosters 
must be submitted. . . . The Padres are certain they will call up second 
baseman Paul Faries from their triple-A club in Las Vegas when they return home 
Sept. 1. Faries has stolen 42 bases this season. Also expected to join the 
Padres are outfielder Thomas Howard and infielder Joey Cora. 
</P>
<P>
Memories were resurrected for several Padre players when they watched replays 
of Cecil Fielder's home run over the left-field roof Saturday at Tiger Stadium. 
That's impressive, to be sure, but Dennis Rasmussen and Mike Pagliarulo 
remember a mammoth shot that left everybody awestruck. It was the opening day 
of the 1987 season when they were members of the New York Yankees, they said, 
and playing on a cold and blustery day in Detroit. In the first inning, with 
Rasmussen on the mound, Larry Herndon hit a home run to dead center that 
bounced off the upper facade. Just how impressive was the homer? The center 
field fence is 440 feet away from home plate. "I think everyone that was at the 
game that day will always remember that one," Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal shortstops incredibly have committed just six errors in 126 games this 
season, handling 563 chances. . . . The Expos' rookie pitchers this season have 
combined for 19 victories and three saves. . . . The Padres will conclude their 
four-game series against the Expos at 4:35 p.m. (PDT) today. Ed Whitson (10-7) 
and Oil Can Boyd (7-4) are the scheduled starters. The Padres then will play a 
two-game series at Shea Stadium against the New York Mets.

MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S CHANCE TO LAUGH AT FEARS OF RECESSION 
</P>

<P>
A recession might be upon us, but it's comforting to know that NFL Properties 
is looking out for the bargain-minded sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
The company is offering a chance to compete in golf, tennis, fishing and flag 
football against former NFL players Gale Sayers, Jack Ham, Bert Jones, Paul 
Warfield and Ted Hendricks. 
</P>
<P>
The activity is scheduled for February of 1991, during Pro Bowl week in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
So you've got some time to think about it. There's a special 800 number, and 
operators are waiting to take your call. 
</P>
<P>
And your $4,995. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the last major league player to hit home runs in four 
consecutive at-bats in one game? 
</P>
<P>
Muteman: Outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., normally the Seattle Mariners' most 
talkative player, told his teammates that when he saw "Darkman" Saturday in 
Kansas City, "It was so good I didn't say a word during the whole movie." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mariner Coach Gene Clines: "It must be the greatest movie ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Add Mariners: When rookie pitcher Brent Knackert turned 21 recently, he went to 
celebrate in the bar of the Oakland hotel where the team was staying. 
</P>
<P>
But the security guard told him: "I'm sorry, in California there's a 24-hour 
waiting period." 
</P>
<P>
Knackert shrugged and walked back to his room. But a group of coaches, who had 
put the guard up to the hoax, stopped the pitcher, took him back to the bar and 
picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
A sad display: In 1977, three years after the death of Hall of Fame pitcher 
Dizzy Dean, the city of Jackson, Miss., established the Dizzy Dean Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it is visited by only three or four people each day. 
</P>
<P>
Con Maloney, the owner of the double-A Jackson Mets, told the Associated Press: 
"I am somewhat embarrassed for the memory of Dizzy Dean that the facility is 
not used any more than it is." 
</P>
<P>
AP reported that if Jackson closes the museum, the Hall of Fame is interested 
in the Dean memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Wear two gloves: Columnist John Steadman of the Baltimore Sun has urged Oriole 
pitcher Ben McDonald to switch from eating sardines to crab the night before he 
pitches. Steadman suggested that this would help the sagging crab industry in 
Maryland and in Louisiana, McDonald's home state. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gunning, a former pitcher in the Orioles' farm system who operates a crab 
house in Baltimore, offered to take McDonald crabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Steadman: "The Orioles, no doubt, would have to grant permission because 
handling live crabs can be precarious. They wouldn't want him to turn into 
another Three-Fingered Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Bring in the fences: On this day in 1977, Toby Harrah and Bump Wills of Texas 
hit inside-the-park home runs on consecutive pitches as the Rangers beat the 
Yankees, 8-2, at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Field of streams: Pittsburgh center fielder Andy Van Slyke recently shared an 
image not many fans get to see when he described the artificial surface in 
center field at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, Lenny Dykstra's defensive 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
Said Van Slyke: "There's so much tobacco and juice all over the rug, you can 
get cancer by just standing out there. It's like a toxic waste dump." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mike Schmidt of Philadelphia in 1976.

U.S. OPEN APPEARS TO BE OPEN; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: EDBERG AND GRAF ARE EACH SEEDED NO. 1, BUT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF 
CHALLENGERS AT FLUSHING MEADOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 110th U.S. Open begins today at Flushing Meadow with Stefan Edberg and 
Steffi Graf top-seeded and favored to win the year's fourth and final Grand 
Slam tennis event, which is expected to have its usual two weeks of heat and 
humidity. 
</P>
<P>
But this U.S. Open will not be routine. For the first time in 21 years, there 
will be no Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
The five-time U.S. Open champion played an exhibition match Saturday against 
Ivan Lendl at Forest Hills, but Connors retired in the third set, complaining 
of exhaustion and leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
Connors, who will be 38 next Sunday, has played one tournament match this year 
and that was in February. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . if you thought I could come in here and win the Open, thank you very 
much, that's some awful strong confidence and I appreciate that, but for 
someone 38 to go out and feel they can be out for six months and go into the 
U.S. Open -- you're fooling yourself, but you're not fooling me," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
If Connors is on the sideline, can 31-year-old John McEnroe be far from joining 
him? 
</P>
<P>
Because of his No. 21 ranking, McEnroe is not seeded. He will play Javier 
Sanchez Vicario in the first round and could play 10th-seeded Andrei Chesnokov 
in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who lost to Edberg in the semifinals Saturday of the Hamlet Challenge 
Cup, is only 7-5 since playing at Queens. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's analysis: "He's a bit slow . . . not as quick as he used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly but surely, McEnroe is winding down, but he is not expected to be a 
factor to challenge for Boris Becker's crown anyway. Nor would have Connors. 
</P>
<P>
The list of real contenders is long, according to Michael Chang: "There's no 
one dominating men's tennis any more. You got some people who win a little more 
than others, but there's nobody who really stands out." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg might come the closest. Ranked No. 1 for the first time, the 24-year-old 
Edberg has won his last three tournaments -- at Wimbledon, Los Angeles and 
Cincinnati -- and owns a 17-match winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's hard court record of 31-3 is the best on the IBM/ATP Tour. Becker has 
not won a Grand Slam title this year, which might make him more dangerous. 
Although he lost to Edberg in the Wimbledon final for the second time in three 
years (Becker beat Edberg in the 1989 Wimbledon final), he has jumped over 
Lendl to No. 2 and won the U.S. Hardcourt title in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
One player Becker will watch out for is 18-year-old Yugoslav left-hander Goran 
Ivanisevic, who is in his quarter of the draw. Becker lost to Ivanisevic at the 
French Open and won a close four-set match at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, a three-time U.S. Open champion, is seeded third, his lowest seeding in 
eight years. Last year, Lendl equalled Bill Tilden's record of eight U.S. Open 
final appearances, although he lost to Becker in four sets. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Andre Agassi and Chang, seeded 11th, could have an impact, but 
Agassi's hard court results have been disappointing recently. He lost to Chang 
in Toronto and to Peter Lundgren in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's 20-4 hard court record is second only to Edberg's. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who has a busy schedule the rest of the year to make up for tournaments 
lost because of his hip injury, won in Toronto and lost to Edberg in the Los 
Angeles final. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the women's field is equally as wide open and more clear-cut. 
Graf remains the favorite to win her third consecutive Open title, but she must 
dispel notions that her game has been affected by her father's widely 
publicized personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The primary challengers to Graf are second-seeded Martina Navratilova and 
third-seeded Monica Seles. If form holds through to the semifinals, Seles would 
play Navratilova in a rematch of the Los Angeles final, which Seles won in 
three sets. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Zina Garrison is once again in Graf's path and so too is 
13th-seeded Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
According to eighth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, "It's an open Open." Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Graf lost to Seles in the French Open final. Navratilova did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Garrison beat Seles in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Garrison beat Graf in 
the semifinal. Navratilova beat Garrison in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Navratilova beat Garrison in a semifinal at Los Angeles. Seles beat 
Navratilova in the final, but only by winning a third-set tiebreaker, 8-6. Graf 
did not play.

World motocross champion Roger DeCoster tried for years to win a United States 
motocross Grand Prix at Carlsbad when he was a rider, but he could never pull 
it off. Sunday, in his first USGP as a promoter, he came out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Motul U.S. 500cc Grand Prix at Glen Helen Park had little at stake except 
the prestige of the sport, but its results pleased just about everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Geboers, the world champion from Belgium, went home the overall winner to 
close out a Grand Prix career that saw him win five world championships overall 
and 11 of 24 individual motos this season. He had announced his retirement when 
the clinched the 1990 crown. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Johnson, from El Cajon, won the second 40-minute moto to prove to all that 
he has recovered from a severe wrist injury that had curtailed his career since 
March 1989. 
</P>
<P>
DeCoster was all smiles as he surveyed the crowd that swarmed over the brown 
hills of Glen Helen. It was reminiscent of the golden days of motocross at 
Carlsbad Raceway a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy," said DeCoster, who was the man most instrumental in 
popularizing the sport in the United States in the early 1970s when he was the 
No. 1 rider in the world. "I was pleased to see all the people, but I was more 
pleased that they saw some great racing." 
</P>
<P>
DeCoster estimated the crowd at 15,000, but many observers felt it was a 
cautiously low figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best USGP I have ever seen," Geboers said. "I say, 'Well done, 
Roger.' " 
</P>
<P>
Geboers' first moto victory, a 40-minute fender-to-fender duel between his 
Honda and Johnny O'Mara's Kawasaki was one of the most competitive in USGP 
history. O'Mara got off the line first, closely followed by Geboers, but it 
only took three loops of the 1.3-mile course before Geboers slipped past O'Mara 
on a tight corner at the bottom of the Yamaha Dropoff, a 65-foot jump on the 
east end of the course. 
</P>
<P>
From then to the finish of the 21-lap race, O'Mara would close to a bike length 
of Geboers over the lower half of the course, which was laid out like stadium 
Supercross. But once the riders left the start-finish line and started up the 
sweeping high-speed portion that was more European-like in its style, Geboers 
would pull slightly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The pace never slackened as Geboers and O'Mara seemed to go faster and faster 
with each lap. It ended with O'Mara tucked in behind Geboers' tailpipe. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave it the best I had," Geboers said. "I was riding over my limit. I was so 
exhausted that I became sick between the motos. It was the hardest moto I rode 
all year." 
</P>
<P>
Far back, Johnson finished third, Jeff Matiasevich fourth and England's Kurt 
Nicoll fifth. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone left unhappy, it had to be the Kawasaki contingent. After O'Mara lost 
a heartbreaker in the first heat, Matiasevich, from La Habra Heights, saw his 
moment of glory disappear in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasevich, riding in his first 500cc race, took the lead from Australia's 
Jeff Leisk before the first lap was completed and built up a substantial margin 
over the first half of the 40-minute moto. 
</P>
<P>
Geboers, knowing he had to finish at least third to win overall if Matiasevich 
held on, was fourth, just ahead of Johnson. Nicoll and Leisk were second and 
third. When Nicoll fell and was bumped by Geboers, Johnson used the confusion 
to pass all three riders and move into second behind Matiasevich. 
</P>
<P>
It took Johnson, riding with a brace on his tender wrist, four laps to catch 
Matiasevich, and once he tasted the lead there was no challenging Johnson. The 
only question then was if Matiasevich could hold off Geboers. 
</P>
<P>
Geboers, fighting off nausea and exhaustion, would not be denied. With three 
minutes remaining, he caught Matiasevich where the course dipped into a canyon 
gully.

UNSER STRATEGY WORKS IN VICTORY AT DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A full-course caution flag early in Sunday's Denver Grand Prix raised a 
strategic dilemma for Al Unser Jr.: to pit or not to pit? 
</P>
<P>
Unser stayed on the track, most of the other leaders pitted and Unser went on 
to earn his third consecutive victory and solidify his hold on the CART-PPG 
series point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"At our team meeting (Sunday morning), we decided we'd get past lap 12 before 
we'd come in," Unser said. "It (the caution flag) was too soon." 
</P>
<P>
The yellow flag waved at the finish line on lap 10 after pole-starter Teo Fabi 
crashed. Unser and teammate Bobby Rahal remained on the downtown street 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the race was pretty much a strategic duel between the two 
teammates, with Unser winning the battle of late pit stops, as mechanical 
problems dropped Rahal to third. 
</P>
<P>
Unser ended up handling the 90-degree heat, the thin air of the mile-high city 
and the demanding 1.9-mile, 16-turn downtown street circuit to beat Danny 
Sullivan by 28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But Rahal raced with Unser through most of the 80-lap, 152-mile race on the 
much slower temporary circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, who earned his 14th career victory and fifth of the season, gave up the 
lead to Rahal by making a final scheduled pit stop on lap 61. 
</P>
<P>
He came back out of the pits trailing Rahal by 16.83 seconds and proceeded to 
slice into that margin every lap, moving up right behind the nearly identical 
Chevrolet-powered Lola of his Galles-Kraco before Rahal was forced to pit for 
fuel on lap 73. 
</P>
<P>
That pit stop was a slow one because Rahal's hydraulic jack and clutch both 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, who won $123,866, averaged 71.24 m.p.h. in the slowest race in CART 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Ayrton Senna won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps for the 
third consecutive time, beating world champion Alain Prost of France and 
extending his Formula One standings lead. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, driving a McLaren-Honda, led all the way, driving cautiously over the 44 
laps. He finished 3.550 seconds ahead of Prost's Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
Senna's teammate, Gerhard Berger of Austria, was third, 28.462 seconds back, 
after a tough battle with Alessandro Nannini of Italy in a Benetton-Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The victory increased Senna's point total to 63 in the world drivers' 
standings. Prost is second with 50 and Berger third with 33. 
</P>
<P>
Senna finished in one hour 26 minutes 31.997 seconds. He averaged 131.272 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rodrigues was the beneficiary of attrition, taking the Denver round of the 
American Racing Series for his first ARS victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, from Van Nuys, took the lead five laps from the end of the 25-lap 
event on the 1.9-mile, 16-turn downtown street circuit. He easily held off 
Robbie Buhl, whose car was having an electrical problem, by 4.24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues earned $29,500 and averaged 61.050 m.p.h.

Long-hitting left-hander Phil Mickelson added the U.S. Amateur title to his two 
NCAA championships, beating Manny Zerman, 5 and 4, Sunday in the double-round 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, 20, of Arizona State, was five under par through the 32 holes 
played. He birdied 10 of them -- including five of his last 12 -- to hold off 
Zerman, 20, of the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson now is eligible to play in next year's Masters, U.S. Open, British 
Open and British Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I've dreamed about for quite a long time," he said. "It was 
a tough match. I'd play well, then I'd play poorly, then I'd play well again. 
But my putter was consistently strong all day." 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson said the turning point may have come at the par-three eighth hole in 
the afternoon. He was one-up but looked about to drop to even after Zerman 
holed out a 55-foot chip shot. But Mickelson promptly sank a 30-foot, 
double-breaking putt for his own birdie to halve the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"For me to make that putt right on top of him made me feel I was still in 
control," Mickelson said. "After he made the chip, I thought I was losing it." 
</P>
<P>
Zerman felt he was "done in" by the 10th hole, which he bogeyed in both the 
morning and afternoon rounds. The second time he played it, he drove into the 
rough, left a wedge short of the green and chipped poorly, leaving himself a 
20-footer. He two-putted for bogey, starting Mickelson on a run where he would 
win four of five holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't feel I was quite in sync all day," Zerman said after hitting 
only 15 fairways and 16 greens. 
</P>
<P>
He called Mickelson, his teammate when both were seniors at University of San 
Diego High School, "an all-around great player. He's a shotmaker with a great 
head on his shoulders, and he doesn't get rattled very easily." 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, 3-up after the morning 18, immediately dropped the first two holes 
of the afternoon. They alternated winning the next four holes, but Zerman never 
could pull even.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
OLAZABAL WINS WORLD SERIES BY 12 STROKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was no contest; a rout all the way. 
</P>
<P>
The last lingering doubt that Jose Maria Olazabal would win the World Series of 
Golf was dispelled when he started with consecutive birdies in Sunday's final 
round at Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 12 ahead with 16 holes to go," the 24-year-old Spaniard said. "I never 
had that kind of a lead before. I didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
He handled it very nicely, going on to a 12-shot victory, the largest victory 
margin in 15 years on the American pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Go on home. Get the hell out of here," a laughing Lanny Wadkins said after 
congratulating Olazabal on his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
After going 12 in front on the second hole, Olazabal turned the last round into 
a victory lap over the Firestone Country Club that he dominated as no one ever 
had, as few would have thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd see 18-under at Firestone," said Wadkins, who had the 
previous record at 13-under. "I didn't think I'd live to see 13-under broken, 
let alone finish second to it." 
</P>
<P>
For the other 46 players in the international field of winners only, it was an 
exercise in frustration, with more than a trace of humiliation thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal led all the way and set a flock of course and tournament records. But 
that doesn't begin to describe his domination. 
</P>
<P>
"The most amazing thing is that there were only three guys within 18 strokes," 
Wadkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal, now unquestioned as the outstanding young player in the world, won 
with rounds of 61, 67, 67 and 67 on a 7,149 yard, par-70 course with the 
reputation and respect of the touring pros as one of the most difficult they 
encounter all season. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal, playing Firestone for the first time, simply took it apart. He opened 
the tournament with a birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie burst in the first round, and 
had a legitimate shot at breaking 60. 
</P>
<P>
He set course and tournament records for 18 holes (61), 36 holes (128), 54 
holes (195) and 72 holes (262). His 36, 54 and 72-hole scores also were the 
best on the PGA Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
While Olazabal was smiling and waving to galleries that gave him standing 
ovations on every back-nine green, Firestone was exerting its more customary 
pressure on the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins, Hale Irwin and Donnie Hammond were the only others under par for the 
tournament. Wadkins, with a 66, took second at 274. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champ Hale Irwin shot a 74 and was third at 277. Hammond was 71-279. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was within 18 strokes of the runaway winner. Some examples: Greg 
Norman was 19 behind at 281, Tom Kite 20 back 282 and PGA title-holder Wayne 
Grady was 29 behind at 291. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was John Huston, a winner in Florida earlier this year. He 
finished 45 strokes behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal, who won $198,000, is now in his fifth season as a touring pro. He has 
played most of his golf on the European tour. He has eight European victories. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel shot four-under-par 68 to win the Northgate LPGA tournament by six 
strokes, the third victory in the past four tournaments for the LPGA's leading 
money winner this season. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who shot 66 and 69 in earlier rounds, finished at 13-under 203 for 54 
holes over the 6,149-yard Edinburgh USA course in Brooklyn Park, Minn., and won 
$56,250. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Hammel, who shot 69 Sunday, and Chris Johnson, with a 68, tied for second 
at 209.

<TEXT>
<P>
Venturing into the cold winter night, Michael Stonebreaker was a football hero 
-- an All-American linebacker at Notre Dame, a member of a national 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks earlier, he and his teammates had visited the White House. 
</P>
<P>
He was, he recalled last month, "on top of the world." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, he was in a world of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He and his date lay severely injured in the wreckage of his car, which had 
plowed through a stop sign and smashed into a utility pole at about 40 m.p.h., 
police estimated. 
</P>
<P>
It was about 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 25, 1989, and Stonebreaker, his blood-alcohol 
level high enough that he would later be charged with driving under the 
influence, had fallen asleep at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The impact forced his hip out of its socket, and his nose and a kneecap were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
His image, too, was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
But 18 months later, Stonebreaker's date, Ursula Garzia, has fully recovered 
from her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
And Stonebreaker is back together again, too, seemingly no worse for the wear 
and tear on his body -- or a year's suspension from the team that was the 
result of a related incident. 
</P>
<P>
Several magazines rank him as the No. 1 inside linebacker in college football. 
Last April, the youngest son of Steve Stonebreaker, an agent and former NFL 
linebacker, was named as the outstanding defensive player in the Irish's final 
scrimmage of spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
Is he back to normal? 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing normal about Michael Stonebreaker," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His Notre Dame career certainly has followed an unusual course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been bizarre," said Stonebreaker, who spent his summer in Texas, working 
for a friend as a personal trainer for high school players. 
</P>
<P>
If he had his way, the 6-foot-1, 230-pound Stonebreaker might never have gone 
to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time all-state linebacker at John Curtis High in River Ridge, La., 
Stonebreaker preferred UCLA. But the Bruins, he said, rescinded their 
scholarship offer after other recruits made commitments to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they didn't want a short, white linebacker from Louisiana," 
Stonebreaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, UCLA would love to have had Stonebreaker, said Bill Rees, the Bruins' 
recruiting coordinator. "Unfortunately, we were filled up," Rees said. "We just 
couldn't take everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker enrolled at Notre Dame, where he developed into a key reserve by 
the end of his freshman season and was expected to challenge for a starting 
assignment as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
But in the summer after his freshman year, Stonebreaker failed a class, 
dropping his grade-point average below 2.0. Although still eligible to play 
under NCAA rules, Stonebreaker was ruled ineligible for the 1987 season by 
Notre Dame, which maintains more stringent standards. 
</P>
<P>
It mattered not that Stonebreaker had attempted to pass the class while 
recovering from ear surgery. He has been deaf in his left ear since he was 2, 
when he fell out of a car, breaking his ear drum and fracturing his skull. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my own fault," Stonebreaker said of his failure to pass a statistics 
course. "I didn't do what I had to do. I made a mistake. I screwed up and 
didn't do my schoolwork. When you sign your scholarship, you're not signing 
just to play football. You're signing to go to class every day and to do what's 
required." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return in 1988, Stonebreaker showed no ill effects from a year's 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he emerged as a star, moving Irish defensive captain Ned Bolcar out of 
the starting lineup and making 33 tackles in Notre Dame's first two games. 
</P>
<P>
By season's end, the Irish were 12-0 and national champions. Stonebreaker was 
an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two months later, he ran his car into a pole. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no short-term memory of the accident," Stonebreaker told a Chicago 
reporter three months later. "I don't remember anything that happened. When I 
woke up in the hospital and saw all the lights, I asked the nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me I was in an accident. Ursula was in the emergency room. She'd be 
OK. Then, I felt this stinging down my right side, and I immediately thought 
they amputated my leg. I am an athlete, and it was the scariest moment of my 
life. I felt down for the leg and then I went into unconsciousness." 
</P>
<P>
When he regained his senses, Stonebreaker discovered that all of his limbs were 
more or less intact. 
</P>
<P>
He soon discovered, though, that his reputation was not. 
</P>
<P>
Letters poured into South Bend, Ind., from around the country, more than a few 
unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"Some said I had embarrassed the university, and that I should be ashamed of 
myself," Stonebreaker said. "But Notre Dame isn't exempt from reality. This 
could have happened to anyone we know. A couple of (the letters), I looked at 
and thought, 'Doesn't this person have anything better to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker also faced several months of rehabilitation and, perhaps even more 
frightening to him, 80 hours of community service under the terms of his court 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He chose to speak to high school students about the evils of drinking and 
driving, although he said of the experience: "It's hard to open up to people 
and tell them your failures." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker grew more expansive when he realized his impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody drinks and everybody parties and everything, and it's something that 
I've done since I was 15 years old," he told an audience that included a 
reporter from the Chicago Tribune. "And sometimes it's an everyday occurrence, 
and drinking and driving is, also. That's what you learn in New Orleans, where 
I grew up. And you don't think twice about it, because what's going to happen 
to you? Nothing's going to happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought I was indestructible. Played football at Notre Dame. Never 
been hurt in my life. Nothing. Been dealing with big, 300-pound guys, just 
throwing them around. I just thought things like this could never happen to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on top of the world. We had won the national championship. I was a 
potential first-round draft choice. And now I'm back at the bottom again. Don't 
know if I'll play football next year. Don't know to what extent arthritis will 
set in or where I'll be four or five months from now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out saying this just for the hell of it or just to get my community 
service done. People are telling you this all the time: 'Don't do drugs. Don't 
drink and drive.' They're not out to give you a hard time. They're doing it 
because they care about you." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker experienced double vision for about four months after the 
accident, but recovered from his injuries in time to pass a physical last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, Stonebreaker had made another costly mistake. 
</P>
<P>
A month earlier, he had driven onto campus, violating a ruling by Notre Dame's 
office of student affairs, which had revoked Stonebreaker's on-campus driving 
privileges after he was convicted of driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Although he claimed that he had driven only a short way to unload clothes and a 
television set for summer school, Stonebreaker was suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was (upset), but I'm not bitter," he said. "If I had to choose all over 
again, I'd go to Notre Dame again, even though I've been through Notre Dame the 
hard way. It's a good school. I've met a lot of really good people. 
</P>
<P>
"At Notre Dame, you have to do things their way. You can't fudge on anything. 
It makes you a stronger person, a better person. You're going to (face) hurdles 
in life, and not being able to play football one year is not that big a thing 
when you're looking at life as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
The year off doesn't seem to have hindered Stonebreaker, who said the 
suspension actually may prove beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"My leg is so much stronger than it was a year ago," he said. "I was setting 
myself up to get hurt, I think. The year off helped me physically to get back 
into the shape I want to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker made great strides last April, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the longer he went, the more comfortable he became, and by the 
end of the spring he was approaching the Michael Stonebreaker of old," Holtz 
said. "I would expect that he would be much, much better this fall. He's got a 
lot of competitiveness about him and an awful lot of talent." 
</P>
<P>
Except for "one bad decision," Stonebreaker has been a model student and 
player, Holtz said. And when a reporter told Holtz's secretary that he was 
preparing a story about Stonebreaker, he was told: "He's been my favorite 
player ever since he's been here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz: "Michael is a very, very special, talented person. He made a 
mistake, (but) he's not a perennial problem." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker graduated last May with a liberal arts degree. Last winter, he 
petitioned Notre Dame's Faculty Board in Control of Athletics to play football 
this fall as a graduate student. He didn't consider going through the NFL draft 
because "nobody's going to bank on a question mark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker will be Notre Dame's only fifth-year senior this season and 
already has been called "Old Man" by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
He has been called worse.

RANKINGS: AN IRONCLAD RULE OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS IS THAT MOST POWERFUL SCHOOLS 
STAY THAT WAY.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three seasons over 20 years. Three season-ending polls. 
</P>
<P>
One trend? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not really, unless you state the obvious: that parity seems to be a 
foreign concept in college football. 
</P>
<P>
The test years were 1969, 1979 and 1989. Teams in the final United Press 
International polls were cross-checked for each of those years. (The Associated 
Press rankings weren't used because they included only the top 10 teams during 
parts of the 1960s.) The results aren't altogether shocking. 
</P>
<P>
For example, of the 60 total poll spots available, the same 36 teams dominated 
the voting. Four teams -- Penn State, USC, Arkansas and Nebraska -- finished in 
the top 20 in 1969, 1979 and 1989. Thirteen teams were one poll shy of matching 
the accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top 20 teams in 1960, nine were still there at the end of the decade. 
Nine teams from the 1970 poll made it to 1979. And 10 survived the cut from 
1980 to 1989. None of those 10 programs -- Miami, Pittsburgh, Michigan, Florida 
State, Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Brigham Young, Washington and USC -- seem 
to be in danger of collapse in the next nine years. And add teams such as UCLA, 
which made the list in 1969 but not in 1979 and 1989. But beginning in 1980, 
the Bruins have finished in the top 20 eight times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when 2001 comes about, we're going to see the same institutions 
winning, the same institutions losing, the same institutions playing in 
basically the same postseason games," said Mickey Holmes, longtime executive 
director of the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's going to be a lot of difference in who's winning and 
who's losing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Louisville Coach Howard Schnellenberger: "I would think there would 
continue to be cycles that there always have been. But the cycles might not be 
as broad as they've been. By and large, the top 40 or 50 teams (will 
dominate)." 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions, of course. Temple made an appearance in the 1979 rankings 
and hasn't been heard from since. Stanford couldn't make it out of the '70s, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
But these are the odd cases. For the most part, what was good way back when, is 
good today. And, it seems, will be tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Below are the final United Press International rankings for 1989, 1979 and 
1969.

Eric Bieniemy's Handy Guide to Home Safety.

Air Colorado: Better Football Through Incompletions, Interceptions, One-Hoppers

On a late August afternoon at Anaheim Stadium Sunday, the entire University of 
Colorado football team and coaching staff went to summer school, learning that 
some great ideas are destined to remain just that. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Coach Bill McCartney keeps saying he wants to pass more this season. 
Why, no one at the Big A Sunday could really be sure. As evidenced throughout 
the Buffaloes' disappointing 31-31 tie with Tennessee in the first Disneyland 
Pigskin Classic, when you have a quarterback who throws like Darian Hagan and 
an offensive line that blocks like Colorado's, your offense should best 
concentrate on three simple maneuvers.

Just pick out a tailback, plug in a name and watch him go. Anybody can qualify. 
Normally, the assignment belongs to Bieniemy, an All-American with Heisman 
hopes and, luckily, no aspirations for fireman. Bieniemy had to sit this game 
out after refusing to run interference for a team of firefighters outside a 
blaze at his parents' home in West Covina. When the fire squad brought out the 
axes to chop through the Bieniemys' front door, Eric tried to physically stop 
them, an incident that led to a one-game suspension by McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
A wide receiver named Mike Pritchard filled in for Bieniemy, making his first 
appearance at tailback since 1987.

Pritchard rushed for 217 yards, the most by a Tennessee opponent since 
Alabama's Bobby Humphries also netted 217 against the Volunteers in a 1986 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard ran for two touchdowns. One covered 55 yards. The other went for 78. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard averaged almost 11 yards a carry and, as a team, Colorado amassed 368 
yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Buffaloes came out throwing. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan passed five times during Colorado's first three possessions. Two of them 
were intercepted. By halftime, Hagan's interception total was up to three -- 
meaning Tennessee had caught more of his passes than Colorado had. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan's first-half statistics: 10 attempts, two completions, 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the afternoon with five completions in 19 tries for 68 yards, 
prompting McCartney to comment, "Hagan experienced a lot of frustration today. 
He is capable of throwing much better than that." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney, however, didn't stick around too long to find out. Finally, he 
returned to the run in the second half. Pritchard took the ball and ran with it 
-- all the way to a 31-17 fourth-quarter Colorado lead. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 10-10, before Pritchard broke loose for 55 yards early in 
the third quarter. And Tennessee was within 24-17 when Pritchard fielded 
Hagan's best pass of the game -- a falling, left-handed, overhead lateral -- 
and carried it 78 yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard also fumbled three times, including his first carry of the game, but, 
hey, this isn't his job. He was the Colorado tailback for the day -- and 217 
yards or no, he is moving to wingback next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric Bieniemy is our tailback," McCartney said. "He's going to get a lot of 
carries and he's going to get a lot of yards. He's one of the great backs in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard claims he doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped in today," Pritchard said. "I did an adequate job, but (Bieniemy) is 
our tailback and that's the way it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Adequate? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, Pritchard insisted. Remember those three fumbles? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I played that great," he said. "In the first half, my mistakes 
cost us. We could've been in great field position; instead, Tennessee had great 
field position. And in the second half, the offensive line was making 
truck-sized holes for me." 
</P>
<P>
His 78-yard scoring sprint, he insisted, was the sole product of Hagan's option 
handiwork. "That's just the magic of Darian Hagan," Pritchard said. "You don't 
see any other quarterbacks who can make a pitch like that." 
</P>
<P>
It was a special kind of play. Hagan took the snap and rolled to right, 
breaking inside and drawing the defense with him. Hagan was hit and as he began 
to fall, he twisted and looked toward the sideline, where his left-handed toss 
found Pritchard all alone and in midsprint. 
</P>
<P>
If only his right-handed throws were as accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Darian is ambi-, ambi- . . . he can throw with both hands," Pritchard said 
with a laugh. "He actually turned around and threw it back. It had some 
velocity on it." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Darian is Mr. Magic," he said again. "That's why you always want to stay with 
him on the pitch phase. You never know when the ball might come." 
</P>
<P>
You could say the same thing about Hagan on the pass phase, but that would be a 
cheap shot. At wingback, Pritchard attempts to catch passes from Hagan. Last 
year he caught 12 of them. He says he prefers it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going back to wingback. That's the way it's going to be and the way I want 
it to be," he says. "I like wingback better. I feel more comfortable there. 
It's a big play position." 
</P>
<P>
It's also riskier that way. 
</P>
<P>
At Colorado, the surest way to get your hands on the football is by way of the 
handoff.

Ed McDowell's patched-up Grand Illusion trailed Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer 
around the course without a need to win the heat during Cabrillo Beach Yacht 
Club's Summer Sled Regatta for ultralight 70s at San Pedro Sunday. Taxi Dancer 
had lost a chance at the overall title Saturday when she was disqualified for 
colliding with Grand Illusion in the second race, so it didn't matter that 
Rouse won Sunday by 2 minutes 25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse could easily have absolved the foul in Saturday's race -- in which he was 
second -- by performing a 720-degree penalty, two full circles. Even with the 
penalty, he would have placed high enough for the overall win. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's race was sailed in winds to 17 knots on a 23-mile course to Pt. Fermin 
and around the outer harbor. After overnight repairs to her hull, Grand 
Illusion, with Billy Peterson at the helm, had only to beat Bob McNulty's 
Chance and Peter Tong's Blondie. RICH ROBERTS

IRAN, SYRIA OPEN IRAQI BORDERS TO MOST REFUGEES

MANAMA, Bahrain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran and Syria, two longtime foes of Baghdad, on Sunday declared their borders 
open to Western, Arab and Asian civilians held in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian authorities announced their decision as five Britons and an Australian, 
all construction workers on an Iraqi project, made it to the frontier in an 
overland escape by truck. "We told them (the Iraqis) we were going to Baghdad 
for a beer," one said on arrival in Damascus. "We headed that way and then we 
turned left across the desert." 
</P>
<P>
With Jordan's borders reopened, with the Syrian and Iranian decisions and with 
Turkey accepting foreigners set free by Baghdad, all of Iraq's frontiers are 
open for passage out with the exception of Kuwait. Saudi Arabia, which also 
borders Iraq, has welcomed refugees from Kuwait, and presumably would take in 
any other foreign nationals that could reach its frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic tie-ups and technicalities have jammed the Jordanian and Turkish 
crossing points over the past two weeks, and if Baghdad permits organized 
departures through Syria and Iran the pressure will ease. There was no 
immediate word from the Iraqis on the decisions by the Syrians and Iranians, 
who said passage would be granted on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of foreigners remain trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, and 
President Saddam Hussein's regime has refused exit for about 12,000 Americans, 
Britons and other Westerners except in a few instances. Citizens of countries 
whose ships have not joined the naval blockade, for instance, have been allowed 
out, as well as the wives and children of detained diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
As more West European warships steamed toward the gulf, the Soviet Union 
announced in Moscow that its ships would not take part in armed enforcement of 
U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference with visiting French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Soviet ships would not join the 
force unless the Security Council specifically set up a blockade mission. He 
said, however, that the weekend Security Council resolution approving "measures 
commensurate to the specific circumstances," which Moscow supported, permits an 
armed blockade by American-dominated naval task forces. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad on Sunday decried the U.N. decision, declaring it illegal. Iraqi 
authorities also reiterated their warning that food shortages in the country 
would be shared by detained foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait city, the standoff continued between defiant diplomats at more than 
20 embassies and Iraqi military authorities who have ordered the missions shut 
down and evacuated. Latest reports said Iraqi soldiers had made no move to 
force out the skeleton staffs, which include U.S. Ambassador W. Nathaniel 
Howell and a few of his officers, but that power to the buildings had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
London officials said that electricity to their embassy was off again Sunday. 
It was on briefly early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a press pool report from Saudi Arabia, two Iraqi jet 
fighters took off from a Kuwait air base at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and headed 
directly for the Saudi border. An American AWACS radar spotted the sortie and 
ordered two U.S. warplanes to the area, the report said, but the Iraqi jets 
turned back before reaching Saudi air space. 
</P>
<P>
Gulf sources reported late Saturday that the Iraqis had not had their planes in 
the air for the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Arab diplomats and travelers who arrived in Syria on 
Sunday after fleeing Iraq said that the Baghdad regime has executed scores of 
senior military officers, including a major general and five brigadiers, for 
refusing to take part in the invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
They said the officers were put to death on the orders of President Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Cairo's Al Ahram newspaper reported on Aug. 9 that 120 Iraqi officers were 
executed for opposing the invasion. Iraq had denied the Egyptian daily's 
report.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dusty field at sunset Sunday, hundreds of balding Iraqi teachers, 
white-haired office workers and paunchy professionals practiced going to war 
with America. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in fatigues and armed to the teeth, they practiced firing mortars. They 
shouldered powerful new rocket launchers, and they charged invisible enemies 
with empty machine guns, shouting all the while such slogans as "Ask the sky: 
Saddam is beloved. Ask the sky: We will fight. Ask the sky until we die." 
</P>
<P>
Meet Saddam Hussein's reservists, Iraq's volunteer Popular Army that is among 
the sights and sounds of a city preparing for war -- perhaps against the entire 
Western world. 
</P>
<P>
It was a publicity event, to be sure, a photo opportunity organized by the 
Iraqi government for the handful of Western television crews and newspaper 
reporters who have been permitted to report on the Persian Gulf crisis from 
inside the country at the heart of it. 
</P>
<P>
But the Popular Army's evening training camp was among the stark images that a 
Times reporter saw during the first day behind what may well become enemy 
lines, and it helped illustrate the depth of control President Hussein and his 
monolithic Arab Baath Socialist Party still appear to enjoy in this sprawling 
capital of 5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
There certainly was no shortage of symbolic imagery of that omnipresence. 
Hussein's first larger-than-life portrait appears on the roadside just a few 
miles out of Saddam International Airport, his right arm outstretched in 
greeting a few hundred feet from a second billboard that declares, "Welcome to 
Baghdad. Capital of Arab Saddam." 
</P>
<P>
And throughout Baghdad, there are literally hundreds of Saddam Hussein 
billboards, some picturing the Iraqi leader in uniform and beret, others in a 
traditional Arab kaffiyeh, still others in a business suit, but, in all of 
them, smiling and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the Ishtar Sheraton Hotel, where the journalists are staying, a 
6-foot-high portrait of the Iraqi president smiles down on the lobby, and the 
only hint of crisis is a sign outside the rooftop elevator announcing, "Please 
be informed that the nightclub will be closed until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, in the souks and shopping centers that provide the Iraqis' daily 
bread, there are few signs on the surface that the world's economic 
stranglehold on Iraq is having an immediate effect. 
</P>
<P>
Most shops were well-stocked with dry goods, canned food and general consumer 
products, and traffic appeared to be moving normally on the city's broad lanes 
and boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Just beneath the surface, though, there was talk of growing hardship. Bread 
lines were seen in parts of the city, a byproduct of a strict government policy 
warning that food hoarders will be shot. There was evidence that the 
black-market economy is growing. And, in sunbaked Baghdad, where day 
temperatures soar to well over 100 degrees, one of the biggest sacrifices of 
daily life is ice cream -- the Arab summer staple that requires two key 
commodities that are running low, sugar and powdered milk. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little evidence of any dissent against an iron-willed president 
who has led Iraq in war during most of the past decade. Taxi drivers, 
shopkeepers and civilians approached on the street all voiced strong support 
for Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, for his image of defiance and for the tough 
stand he is taking against the West. 
</P>
<P>
"You can ask any Iraqi, and he will tell you that we feel Kuwait is a part of 
our country that was taken away from us," said Moyat Sayed, a 55-year-old 
English teacher, who similarly said he believes Iraq should possess chemical 
weapons because the Americans and Soviets possess them. 
</P>
<P>
"The mentality is different here," he added, in explaining that Iraq also feels 
justified in keeping Westerners as virtual hostages in Baghdad and Kuwait 
because the Americans forced Japanese into U.S. internment camps during World 
War II. "The Arab people support Iraq's invasion," he said, "only some Arab 
governments don't agree because they don't represent their people." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not by coincidence, that is the same line broadcast several times daily 
on government radio and television and carried in the state-run newspapers in 
what, taken together, ranks among the world's most effective propaganda 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point was Sunday's edition of the government's English-language 
daily, The Baghdad Observer, which led with the headline: "President Hussein 
Says U.S. Occupation of Arab Sacred Land Is a Crime." Another prominent story 
reported the government's decision to permit the 52 wives and children of 
American diplomats stopped here en route from Kuwait to Turkey to leave Iraq. 
And, throughout the paper, the editors clearly sought to whip up anti-American 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Arab-Americans Harassed, Threatened With Death," shouted a front-page headline 
over an obscure wire story from Boston reporting on a 41-year-old American of 
Arab descent who received death threats in that city. Another front-page story 
reported on anti-American demonstrations in many Arab and European capitals and 
quoted a Jordanian Islamic leader as shouting "Death to America, death to 
Israel, death to the emirs (Kuwait's exiled rulers)!" Surprisingly, though, 
very little such sentiment seems to have reached Baghdad's grass-roots. A taxi 
driver at the airport, for example, asked The Times reporter his nationality. 
</P>
<P>
"American," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
The driver beamed and held out his hand. "America very good. America good. 
Welcome. Welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused for a second and added, "Well, America so-so. There are some 
problems there, but inshallah (if God wills) they will soon be gone, and we 
will be friends." 
</P>
<P>
Although hardly as effusive, even members of Hussein's Popular Army took time 
out from their training exercises Sunday night to explain that the gulf crisis 
is not yet a confrontation between Iraqis and Americans, but between 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Modhaffar Abad, a 48-year-old professor at Baghdad College, leaned his AK-47 
assault rifle against his leg and said, in fluent English, that he spent two 
enjoyable years in New York on a scholarship in the early 1980s. "American 
people are very friendly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you now fight America?" Abad was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, yes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you kill Americans?" 
</P>
<P>
"If the soldier will come to my country, yes. If somebody should come to your 
house and try to enter by force, you must kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'll be frank with you. We are not against anybody. We are not against 
any person. We are against anyone who says Iraq is going to get put down. 
Personally, we have to defend our country. 
</P>
<P>
"And if my friend in the United States is going to be a certain person invading 
my country, I will kill this friend to defend my brother. You are my friend 
now, but if you are going to take this machine gun and kill me, my brother will 
use it to kill you. That is the way here."

OPEC REPORTED NEAR ACCORD ON BOOSTING OUTPUT

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are 
nearing an agreement that would allow Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries to 
begin pumping extra oil to make up for lost supplies from Iraq and Kuwait, 
sources familiar with the talks said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ministers, meeting informally in Vienna, appear close to consensus on 
a plan that would allow the group's members to exceed their individual quotas 
as long as total oil production does not exceed OPEC's overall ceiling of 22.5 
million barrels a day, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC would have to convene in formal session before giving final approval to 
any agreement, which sources here said could be completed as early as today. 
But even if no agreement is reached, Saudi Arabia has said it is prepared to 
begin pumping an extra 2 million barrels a day in an attempt to stabilize the 
market in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they will reach an agreement to allow people to produce within the 
(overall) quota limit. . . . A consensus is emerging," said one source, adding 
that Saudi Arabia intends to increase production with or without OPEC's 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of OPEC members now appear inclined to go along with Saudi Arabia's 
position, Saudi officials believe, because to do otherwise would be to risk 
destroying the oil cartel and whatever future influence they may be able to 
wield via their membership in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"In the back of their minds, they know we have both the capacity and the 
ability to increase production and they know we will," said one source familiar 
with Saudi Arabia's position in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"What you are seeing is Saudi Arabia almost being able to dictate to OPEC, 
almost being able to control the oil market. Do the other people want to have a 
working relationship with Saudi Arabia, or do they want to throw OPEC out the 
window and let Saudi Arabia run the show?" 
</P>
<P>
There was no announcement in Vienna, the site of the talks, that any agreement 
is pending. Ministers from all but two of OPEC's 13 member nations -- Iraq and 
Libya -- arrived Sunday for the informal talks. A vote of seven members will be 
required to call an emergency formal conference, and at least 10 would have to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, the cartel's president, told reporters 
Sunday that officials would try to "minimize as far as possible the negative 
impact" of the Persian Gulf crisis, which has sent oil prices soaring past $30 
a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we have in mind is to save OPEC," Boussena said. 
</P>
<P>
World oil production has fallen by an estimated 4.5 million barrels a day 
because of the international trade embargo imposed on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil 
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent proclaimed annexation of the 
tiny gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait together possess about 20% of the world's oil reserves. Saudi 
Arabia, however, controls more than a quarter of gulf oil production and has 
historically sought to keep oil prices moderately low in an effort to encourage 
long-term demand. 
</P>
<P>
Following the crisis in the gulf, Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir announced 
that Saudi Arabia was prepared to begin pumping an extra 2 million barrels a 
day, on top of the 5.38-million-barrels-a-day quota assigned by OPEC at its 
most recent meeting in July. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, OPEC ministers agreed to restrain production to 22.5 million 
barrels a day in the last half of the year in an effort to drive prices up to a 
new target of $21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
That benchmark price was quickly surpassed because of the gulf crisis, and some 
OPEC members without the ability to increase production have reportedly been 
reluctant to allow other OPEC members to cut into the new pricing windfalls by 
boosting production. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has argued that allowing some increase in oil output to make up 
for the losses of Iraq and Kuwait is necessary to preserve long-range demands 
for OPEC oil. The Saudis are still smarting from a 1970s oil embargo that 
brought enough conservation measures and alternative energy development in the 
West that demand has still not fully recovered to pre-1970s levels. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement Saudi officials are pushing for now would allow OPEC members to 
exceed their individual quotas to make up for lost oil from Iraq and Kuwait, as 
long as the overall 22.5-million-barrels-per-day ceiling is not exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's oil minister, Celestino Armas, told reporters in Vienna that his 
country will increase output by an important percentage because of the 
possibility that the oil crisis could be an extended one. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that Venezuela could increase production by up to 500,000 
barrels a day over its OPEC quota of 1.9 million barrels. The United Arab 
Emirates, Nigeria and Libya also have the ability to pump extra oil, and there 
are indications that the United Arab Emirates is also prepared to move forward 
to increase its production, according to some sources. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said much of the remaining shortfall could be made up by non-OPEC 
producers in Mexico, the United States and the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials, along with Venezuela, were unsuccessful in attempting to 
convene an emergency OPEC meeting last week. But Saudi Arabia has persisted in 
trying because it wants to preserve the oil cartel and is seeking "political 
sanction" for increasing its production, according to sources familiar with the 
Saudi position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exactly the way George Bush did it with the U.N.," said one source, 
referring to the Administration's urging the U.N. Security Council to support 
the use of military force to enforce a trade blockade against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC member nations are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, 
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

NAVAJOS TRY TO SEIZE POWER IN SWEEPING BID FOR OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: AN ALL-INDIAN SLATE RUNS IN COUNTY ELECTION IN SOUTHERN UTAH, WITH 
THE GOAL OF REDISTRIBUTING FUNDS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the day this spring when six American Indians walked into the San Juan 
County Courthouse, the Navajos of southern Utah had offered little resistance 
to the steady encroachment of white settlers into the starkly beautiful canyons 
along the San Juan River. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first Mormon wagons arrived in 1880, the Navajos were confined 
to the barren lands of a reservation. They languished in poverty while the 
Mormon settlers built prosperous towns and established farms of wheat and 
alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Navajos believe they can turn the established order upside down. Their 
goal is to take over the "white man's government" in the next countywide 
elections and radically redistribute county funds. 
</P>
<P>
The movement is apparently the first attempt by American Indians to use the 
ballot box to unseat an established, Anglo-dominated government. A Navajo 
victory could send an important signal across the West, where American Indians 
form large but often inactive voting blocs in dozens of rural counties. 
</P>
<P>
The six who entered the courthouse registered to run as an All-Indian slate for 
key posts inthis county of 13,000 residents, which is split almost evenly 
between Indians and whites. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Maryboy, 34, a tall, soft-spoken Navajo who is running for reelection to 
the county commission, heads the slate. The Indians, all Democrats, face an 
all-white, all Republican slate of incumbents, some of them descendants of the 
Mormon pioneers of the last century. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Indian candidates wear T-shirts proclaiming in Navajo: "Niha 
whol zhiizh" (It's our turn). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why Native Americans should suffer if they can see the problems 
are all around them," Maryboy said. "They should speak out and fight for their 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps inevitably, the campaign has turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian candidates say they were insulted by angry whites while marching in 
a Fourth of July parade in the predominantly white town of Blanding. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have exchanged allegations of corruption and racism in recent weeks. 
This month, federal mediators arrived in the county to help soothe the growing 
ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the Mormons) have the attitude that they're somehow chosen by God to 
be superior to anybody who isn't a member of the church," Maryboy said. "We 
shouldn't be afraid of the white people. They eat, breathe and die like we do." 
</P>
<P>
Most Anglo residents seem angered by the Navajos' move for power. Some believe 
an Indian-led government would lead to fiscal disaster. More than anything, the 
Anglo farmers, schoolteachers and merchants say they resent that race and 
religion have even become issues in their otherwise peaceful, bucolic county. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's racism and prejudice, it sure as heck isn't coming from me," said 
Tyrone Lewis, 47, a Mormon farmer and county commissioner who has tangled with 
Maryboy and other Indian leaders. "If (the Navajo candidates) don't get their 
way, they start screaming racism. . . . I'm not a racist. Some of my best 
friends are Navajos." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is their unity in the Navajo ranks. Some conservative Navajos have 
reportedly summoned "skinwalkers," Indian shamans, to launch a spiritual war 
against their radical brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the members of the Indian slate and their supporters have forged 
ahead with the election drive. They have set a goal of registering 2,000 new 
Navajo voters. Presently, the county has 6,000 registered voters, most of whom 
are white. 
</P>
<P>
But organizing a mass movement among the Navajos hasn't been easy, said Jean 
Melton, 37, the slate's campaign manager. For one thing, many of the 
registration applications get turned down by the county because of the 
difficulties in establishing correct names and addresses on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Navajos traditionally have found strength in an ancient belief 
system that stresses obedience to the tribe alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Navajo language itself is a problem, Melton said, since English political 
terms and slogans have few Navajo equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to say 'Power to the people' in Navajo," she explained. Power 
can only go to the niha, the leader. You have to use metaphors. We tell a story 
about driving a car. About how you have to drive a car yourself and how no one 
can do it for you." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Navajos have virtually ignored the white man's affairs, Melton 
said, and many consider San Juan County to be literally a foreign government, a 
world apart from their sovereign Navajo nation. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Nakai, this year's Indian candidate for county clerk, said until recently 
she mistakenly thought it was illegal for residents of the reservation to run 
for county office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always people from off reservation who were running, so it made me 
think we weren't eligible," said Nakai, 41, a Cherokee who married into a Utah 
Navajo family. "We need to educate everybody that we're all citizens of this 
county." 
</P>
<P>
If Navajos can win a stronger voice in county government, Nakai and the other 
Indian candidates argue, residents of the reservation can finally get their 
fair share of badly needed services, including electricity and water. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan is both Utah's poorest and largest county. About 30% of county 
families live below the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the families on the arid, desert-like reservation do without 
running water. Many Indian communities in the 7,800-square-mile county -- 
roughly the size of Connecticut -- are not served by roads and can only be 
reached on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the impoverished Utah Indians live on top of a large oil and 
natural gas field that generates millions of dollars of royalties for state, 
county and tribal governments. 
</P>
<P>
One recent study found that between 1979 and 1988, the reservation had 
generated more than $50.6 million in revenues for the county, but had received 
in return only $30.5 million in services. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the All-Indian slate doesn't sweep the November election, Daniel 
McCool, a political scientist at the University of Utah, said he believes it is 
only a matter of time before the Navajos exert political dominance in San Juan 
County. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, demographic trends and increased political awareness among 
American Indians favor the Navajos, he said. Similar patterns have led to 
recent victories by individual Native American candidates in county elections 
in New Mexico, Arizona and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"You're really talking about the potential takeover of the San Juan County 
government -- ultimately that's going to happen," he said. "It's going to be a 
very confrontational process, but eventually (Navajos and Anglos) will learn to 
work together. They will learn that confrontational politics have a tremendous 
price." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the Anglo residents of San Juan County don't seem to be 
willing to surrender the county government they have controlled for more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
At the Blanding auto parts store of Howard Randall, where a half dozen 
residents angrily discussed campaign developments, Kelly Laws, a 35-year-old 
farmer, said Navajos don't deserve to hold county office because, as residents 
of the sovereign Navajo reservation, they don't pay local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a civil war once because we had a nation within a nation," said Laws, 
whose grandparents worked as Mormon missionaries on the Navajo reservation. "It 
looks crooked to me to have someone getting a job that's paid by the taxpayers 
and not having to pay taxes yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Laws and other Anglo inhabitants of the county say they find the Navajo 
challenge especially difficult to accept because they take pride in the 
efficiency and independence of their local government. 
</P>
<P>
Blanding, Monticello and other towns in San Juan County were created by hardy 
Mormon pioneers whose religious faith helped them overcome both the unforgiving 
desert terrain and the persecution of federal marshals, who sought to arrest 
them as polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
Given this history, it didn't sit too well with most Mormon residents here when 
federal officials arrived in the county earlier this year to monitor the 
election and to ensure compliance with voting rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. attorneys had filed suit against the county in 1984, alleging that the 
county had failed to guarantee fair elections and full participation among 
Navajo-speaking voters. The suit was settled when the county agreed to redraw 
district boundaries so that an American Indian could be elected to the 
three-member county commission. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. attorneys have made new requests of county officials, including that 
they produce Navajo-language radio commercials announcing the election, said 
County Clerk Gail D. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that even though she has worked hard to comply with the requests, 
she still resents the intervention of the federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"When you complain, it looks like you're racist against the Navajo," she said. 
"But it's not that at all. It's the principle of the thing. I think that's 
oppressive in America, for the federal government to come in and do that to a 
little local government." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the November election, supporters of the All-Indian 
slate say they can already claim an important victory -- more Navajos than ever 
are registered to vote and there is a growing consciousness among them about 
the importance of local government. 
</P>
<P>
That much was clear late one afternoon, when 25 Navajos gathered to discuss the 
election at the home of a supporter in the heart of the Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the heat on the sagebrush covered mesa, the meeting was held in the 
shade of a "summer house," a shack with a makeshift roof of roughly cut wooden 
beams and cottonwood branches. 
</P>
<P>
"How many here will register people to vote?," Chester Harrison, a social 
worker, asked in Navajo. There was a brief pause. 
</P>
<P>
"It only takes 10 minutes," he added. "Remember, we're all climbing this 
mountain together." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, most of those present raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Although power lines to the oil and gas fields of the reservation run close by, 
the home was without electricity. When the sun set and the desert sky turned to 
deep violet, the activists found themselves sitting in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than call an end to the meeting, two men walked across a dirt path to 
their automobiles. They used the car headlights to illuminate the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
And the talk of ballots and election campaigns continued.

THE COMPLEXITIES OF PAIRING PRINCIPAL AND SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SHOULD POSITIONS BE ROTATED ON A REGULAR BASIS? WHAT ABOUT PARENT 
INPUT? CONTINUITY? SUPT. TOM PAYZANT, FOR ONE, HAS CHANGED THE WAY HE VIEWS 
REASSIGNMENT.

<P>
By all accounts, Virginia Foster had done an excellent job running Morse High 
School in Encanto for the past seven years and had no desire to move to another 
site. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this month, when San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant and 
school board trustees rejected the three finalists among applicants for the top 
post at troubled Lincoln High, Payzant phoned Foster on the morning of the 
board meeting to tell her she was being moved there. 
</P>
<P>
While Foster's switch was only one of dozens made during the annual spasm of 
principal reassignments announced over the past two months, it enjoyed special 
visibility among several surprise transfers because both Lincoln and Morse are 
home to a significant number of the district's nonwhite students whose academic 
achievement lags unacceptably behind state and county averages. 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrows were also raised because Payzant has promised Foster he will discuss a 
bonus plan as part of her new post, his trial balloon to push individual 
contracts for principals at selected schools, in contrast to present policies 
for uniform pay based on enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
She also is being permitted to take her administrative assistant, her head 
counselor, a resource teacher, her ROTC instructor and a vice principal to 
Lincoln, considerations almost unheard of when transfers occur. 
</P>
<P>
As such, Foster's unexpected transfer symbolizes the complex nature of 
principal selection, principal transfer and principal demotion in the nation's 
eighth-largest urban school system. 
</P>
<P>
Should principals be rotated regularly no matter what kind of job -- good or 
mediocre -- they have done in their present assignments? Should changes be made 
in salary scales that automatically reward principals at larger schools? 
</P>
<P>
What about the increasing demand by parents and teachers for a say in who comes 
to their school? What to do with administrators trained as managers at a time 
when new conditions demand leadership in improving instruction and helping 
teachers adapt to a wider range of student preparation? 
</P>
<P>
"Candidly, we'd like to have more continuity, but people also want to make more 
money, we have deaths and retirements, we have some principals whom we can't 
figure out what to do with -- it's not always easy to get the right fit," 
school board President Kay Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant, about to enter his ninth year as district superintendent -- the 
longest tenure of his 22-year career -- has changed his view of how to handle 
principal assignments. 
</P>
<P>
No longer does he believe principals should be rotated among the district's 
170-some schools every three to four years, just for the sake of change, as he 
strongly felt when he arrived in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The critical need for schools to create strong parent-school ties, to 
experiment with educational reforms and stimulate better teaching -- these and 
other requirements for creative leaders argue for greater longevity as well as 
improved principal training and ongoing reassessment, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
But he concedes that, despite his high hopes for quicker change, the reality of 
a district with multiethnic demands, wide-ranging student achievement and 
uneven administrative talent has so far resulted in only halting progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Where possible, I would like more stability and continuity for principals," 
Payzant said. "But you're always faced with having to weigh the needs of a 
particular school and the entire district against the wishes of an individual 
employee, and to strike the best balance among conflicting views." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his administrators are still told they are principals within 
the San Diego Unified School District, "and not principals of a particular 
school." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Foster, Payzant said the veteran's leadership abilities were 
needed at Lincoln after trustees decided that the three finalists, all vice 
principals, should not be given as their first assignment a school with the 
toughest socioeconomics of any site in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Foster was identified as one of the few black district principals who could 
move forward with programs at Lincoln, long considered an educational symbol 
for the black Southeast San Diego community. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't give her a choice because if you do that, you have to be willing to 
accept 'no,' and I wasn't willing in this case," Payzant said. While Foster has 
a longstanding policy of not talking to the press, several associates said 
privately that she was not thrilled by the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said he told her that "if she had a similar situation" to his, she 
would do the right thing. "And she laughed,," he said. "There's always going to 
be tension if you really believe you ought to have your best principals in the 
toughest schools when some of those people may not want those positions." 
</P>
<P>
But the superintendent, in a move related to his push for fundamental changes, 
has offered Foster incentives in exchange for her acceptance of the transfer. 
Such site-based incentives could include a bonus plan based on her 
accomplishment of specific objectives, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about something in the range of $3,000 to $4,000, money in 
return for accomplishing objectives at Lincoln," he said. "And yes, some 
administrators might not like this at all because they are leery of 
performance-based bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think as part of our whole restructuring effort, we should open up our 
thinking in response to incentives." 
</P>
<P>
That restructuring -- under which the district hopes to give principals, 
teachers and parents more decision-making power and accountability at 
individual schools -- is already leading to some changes in the selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous schools where the former principal retired or died have taken 
advantage of a new district policy that allows teachers and parents to 
participate in interviews of applicants for these so-called "first-order" 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Maruta Gardner, principal at Mann Middle School for the past six years, was 
asked by several teachers at Mission Bay High to apply after their principal 
retired. Gardner said she had been interested in moving to a high school, but 
would have stayed at Mann if her superiors could have guaranteed that she would 
not have been moved to another school against her wishes. They made no such 
guarantee this past spring, when the first soundings are made annually among 
administrators as to what moves might be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to move, I want to go to a place that I really want to be at," 
Gardner said. "Just waking up one morning and finding out that you are going to 
a new school, after putting your heart and soul in a job you like, that's not 
the best way to do things." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner believes that principals chosen through restructuring must be allowed 
to stay at a school longer than in past years in order to move programs forward 
and repay the trust shown in them by parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"And all the research tells me that you need at least four to five years to put 
programs into place, to get a school on track," Gardner said. "So if people are 
moving every three to four years, that's counterproductive to everything being 
said now." 
</P>
<P>
However, the size of the district mitigates against a rapid reduction of 
wholesale rotations because of what Payzant calls "backfill" and others call 
"dominoes," the filling of the posts vacated when principals are promoted or 
otherwise moved to positions left empty by retirement or death. 
</P>
<P>
Principals for the backfill posts have traditionally been plucked from schools 
without interviews or bids, based only on what assistant superintendents 
believe would be good combinations of administrator and site, as well as a way 
to punish or reward. 
</P>
<P>
Former Crawford High Principal Nancy Shelburne, now a district administrator, 
recalled walking into a trustee meeting one Tuesday afternoon to receive an 
award for excellence for her two years of leadership at Bell Junior High. "And 
while getting the award, they said, 'By the way, you're being moved to 
Crawford,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for example, after the principal at Grant successfully applied for 
the post at McKinley Elementary, Payzant and his assistants moved the principal 
from Fremont Elementary to Grant, the principal from Silver Gate to Fremont, 
the principal from Kennedy to Silver Gate and promoted a vice principal from 
Florence to principal at Kennedy. Some of the moves were promotions, some were 
lateral transfers and others were warnings to those judged to be doing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant did allow two schools with backfill vacancies this year to conduct 
interviews first with prospective principals, but he said that to allow 
teacher/parent participation at all schools with vacancies would slow down the 
process unacceptably. 
</P>
<P>
"As more and more schools want a say (in selection), it's going to get harder 
to handle each year because you always reach a point in the calendar where 
we've got to have principals in place," he said, noting that it can take up to 
six months to fill a vacancy by going through the complete notification and 
interview process. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there could be some principals wanting to move -- or some whom 
Payzant wants to move -- who would prove unacceptable to parents and teachers 
at any school. "We've got to place those principals somewhere" because current 
policies almost foreclose demotions back to the classroom, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of principals at small schools who perform well generally want to 
move up to sites with larger enrollments because that means more money, said 
Cathy Hopper, a longtime principal and assistant superintendent who retired in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"And for lousy principals, they are never going to be moved up to a larger 
school, so they just get moved around from small school to small school," 
Hopper said, referring to longstanding district policies of not giving bigger 
schools to principals with poor records. 
</P>
<P>
"So some small schools that are among the toughest to lead in the district end 
up with a new principal every three years and don't show the academic or 
leadership growth that they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Hopper allowed Barry Bernstein, considered one of the district's better 
elementary principals, to stay an extra year at Torrey Pines in order to 
nurture several important curriculum and race-relations programs new to the 
school, at a time when Bernstein had been tagged by Payzant for a bigger school 
needing his expertise and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"He suffered financially (for a year), but he wanted to stay," Hopper said of 
Bernstein, now principal at Horton Elementary, a school with one of the largest 
enrollments and a variety of academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bernstein, "I believe that five to seven years could make it easier to 
develop stronger relationships with parents as well as gain the confidence of 
teachers and students . . . but I can also say that purposeful and planned 
transitions can help produce better principals as well." 
</P>
<P>
But in too many cases, administrators concede, principals learn of their 
transfer to a school of which they know little or nothing about, and are forced 
to undertake a crash course during the summer to know at least the names of 
their new teachers by September. The time line is shortened further for those 
principals assigned to the increasing number of year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
The iconoclastic superintendent of the 12-school South Bay elementary district 
in Imperial Beach moves his principals around on five-year rotations, but sits 
down with each one and discusses why they are being moved to a particular 
school and what he wants them to try in their new position. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't just leave someone largely to his or her devices without any 
specific plan," Philip Grignon said. "I watch each school, I know the strengths 
and weaknesses of each principal, so I'm not just moving them around for the 
hell of it" or basing the changes just on intuition. 
</P>
<P>
"After five years, I think most principals have done the magic they can at a 
particular school, and so it's nice to bring in someone with a different 
perspective. But we remain a centralized district with a strong academic focus, 
and no school is going to go from pillar to post," Grignon said. 
</P>
<P>
"One principal may be good at improving a school through his or her 
personality, while another who has strong organizational skills will work well 
at a school needing less of the personal touch. . . . The bottom line still has 
to be better student results."

ONE MAN'S JUNK IS ZORTHIAN'S IDEA OF ARTISTIC TREASURE; 
</P>
<P>
ECCENTRICITY: THE NEVER-ENDING WORK IN PROGRESS IN ALTADENA ATTRACTS NOTORIETY. 
HE'S BEEN CALLED A 'MOUNTAIN TOULOUSE-LAUTREC' AND 'A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.'

<P>
In an instant, Jirayr Zorthian scampered up a narrow iron ladder on a retaining 
wall at his Altadena ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortcut," he explained, as he toured his rambling, dust-covered spread in the 
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
From this vantage point, the painter-sculptor-craftsman-eccentric scanned a 
landscape heaped with junk: a full-sized telephone booth, heavy-equipment 
tires, river rocks, rusty metal slats and broken concrete -- all grist for the 
Zorthian artistic mill. 
</P>
<P>
To him, everything is a work in progress. "I have 40 more years of work," 
Zorthian said. "I'm 79 now. So, 40 years from now. . . ." he paused for 
emphasis. "I'll be 119." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the Zorthian art ranch makes clear that he has no intention of 
relinquishing any of his roles -- as rattlesnake handler, horse breeder, 
architect, painter, winemaker, hog butcher, lover of life and raconteur 
extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
Shirtless and in shorts on a recent day, Zorthian walked the ups and downs and 
sideways of his ranch, 45 acres of chaparral perched 2,000 feet above sea 
level, with the rest of Altadena and Pasadena covered in smog below. This place 
-- rich in textures, shapes and smells -- has been his home since he left the 
U.S. Army Intelligence Corps after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although by no means a famous artist, the Yale-educated painter has exhibited 
around the country and the world. As a teacher and mentor, he has inspired 
many. In Pasadena art circles, his reputation for eccentricity has grown to 
mythic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to these boring, liberal parties and there he is having a great time, 
wearing a hand-tooled leather top hat and colorful vests," said Pasadena arts 
activist Dorothy Garcia. "He's like a half-man, half-horse, a centaur with Pan 
influences, dancing on tables. He's sort of a mountain Toulouse-Lautrec." 
</P>
<P>
Zorthian gained fame in the best-selling book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. 
Feynman!" The author, the late Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning 
physicist at Caltech, recounted how Zorthian, taken by Feynman's bongo drum 
playing at a party, ran into the bathroom and sprayed designs in shaving cream 
on his hairy chest. When he returned, Zorthian had cherries hanging from his 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, this crazy nut and I became good friends right away," Feynman 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Decades after the bongo-inspired dance, Zorthian is still exploring his own 
laws of physics and art. 
</P>
<P>
He is known for hosting exotic banquets with a robust blend of intellectuals, 
scientists, movie stars and artists in attendance. Pilgrims such as actor 
Burgess Meredith, futurist R. Buckminster Fuller, Bob Hope's wife, Dolores, and 
comedian Cheech Marin have journeyed up the dusty switchbacks to see the 
ranch's wonders. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who relishes Zorthian's feasts is Albert R. Hibbs, now retired 
after years of prominence as a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist. He said, 
"(Zorthian) is often a little bit crazy, but in such a pleasant way." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, William Agee, then the director of the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art 
(later taken over by the Norton Simon Museum), said Zorthian's "entire ranch is 
a living work of art. . . . The distinction between architecture and art is 
difficult to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Proudly, Zorthian said, "This entire property has sort of been sculpted with a 
skip-loader." 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, part art and part function, takes various forms. The most famous 
are his walls, which curb erosion on the mountainside and embody his visions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a controlled artistic situation," Zorthian said, pointing to his 
favorite wall, taller than he is and sloping with the earth's contour. 
</P>
<P>
Encased amid the mortar and stone are a shovel, a piece of a tree that shaded 
Zorthian's studio with bright yellow flowers before it died, and a baby doll 
with a hair-loss problem (Lady Godiva, he explained) on a ceramic horse. 
</P>
<P>
Another totem contains a series of metal strips behind a rusted radiator. On 
each strip is inscribed Zorthian's version of the seven deadly sins: 
"Judgmental. Indulgence. Vanity. Anger. Anxiety. Procrastination. Gluttony." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Zorthian said, he hopes to finish his decades-in-production, three-story, 
creosote-colored barn/house made of telephone poles. Scores of bottle-glass 
electrical insulators stud the outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Dabney, 56, live in a stone farmhouse, chockablock with 
artifacts and art, including the governor of Tennessee's 1987 declaration that 
Zorthian is a "Tennessee Colonel" because of the mural he painted in 1938 in 
the state capitol. 
</P>
<P>
One notable attraction on his ranch is buried behind a wall of rusting items. 
It's an elephant Zorthian made for a 1959 exhibit at the Pasadena Museum of 
Modern Art, constructed from a fire hose, buckets, burlap and rope. Inside the 
animal's stomach is a papier-mache missionary's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this in 1959, long before Kienholtz and the others were doing this kind 
of art and selling it for a fortune," he said, referring to Edward Kienholtz, 
whose assemblage "Back Seat Dodge '38" is in the Los Angeles County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
As Zorthian surveyed his domain, he quoted an old saying: " 'Art is long but 
life is short.' You can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Come back in 20 years and you'll really see something."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
With This Rink, I Thee Wed . . . 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, I don't do windows or weddings. 
</P>
<P>
I've declined possible items recently on a hockey goalie marrying his beloved 
on the ice at the San Diego Ice Arena, and two hiker-lawyers from San Diego 
exchanging vows atop Tahquitz Rock (Elev. 1,200 feet) near Idyllwild. 
</P>
<P>
For future reference, here is my rule: I only do 50th wedding anniversaries 
when husband and wife are both on roller skates, as they were on their Wedding 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
As such, I am obligated to report that James and Aleva Gantz of San Diego will 
renew their vows tonight at Skateworld in Linda Vista, surrounded by kith and 
kin (including seven skating grandchildren). 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 2, 1940, the Gantzes were married at the Pacific skating rink 
downtown, with the entire wedding party on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
It was a natural: Aleva (Cookie) was a "floor-lady" at the Pacific rink, 
picking up skaters when they fell, blowing a whistle to maintain order. Jimmy 
was just out of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a roller-skate romance. The couple had met at the Mission Beach Roller 
Rink. 
</P>
<P>
It was roller-skating's heyday. The owner of the Pacific knew a media grabber 
when he saw it; he hosted the wedding, attracted 700 customers and got a splash 
in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's half a century later, and Cookie is 69 years old, a retired computer 
operator, and still teaching kids to skate. Jimmy is 72, a retired food 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
The evening at Skateworld will include a demonstration of skating through the 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's son Larry, 49, a communications consultant in Arizona, will serve 
as emcee. He was the 1957 California yo-yo champion, and so naturally he'll do 
yo-yo tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Skates or no, 50 years of marriage is a long time. Is there a link? 
</P>
<P>
"I got a letter from the Roller Skating Assn.," says Cookie, "saying that this 
proves that whoever rolls around together, stays together, or something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
If anybody else has a better formula for ensuring wedded bliss, I've yet to 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Stories 
</P>
<P>
Here, there, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego's crime rate is an issue in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein is blasting Pete Wilson by saying crime increased in San Diego 
by 25% during his tenure as mayor, while it decreased by 27% in San Francisco 
when she was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson retorts that San Diego had the lowest crime rate of the nation's 10 
biggest cities when he left, while San Francisco was fourth on the list when 
Feinstein departed. 
</P>
<P>
There, now do you feel safer? 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. James Traficant (D-Ohio) is seeking a congressional hearing into the 
war-crimes case of Arthur Rudolph, the German scientist who worked in San Diego 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Traficant's House Resolution 404 is supported by a small group of San Diegans 
who believe Rudolph is innocent and should have his naturalized U.S. 
citizenship restored. 
</P>
<P>
It is opposed by the national Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, which 
believes Rudolph is guilty and had ample opportunity to state his case during a 
Department of Justice probe in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego city attorney is renewing his periodic warning to City Council 
members not to have discussions with developers with pending projects. 
</P>
<P>
No tete-a-tetes, no private deals. 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: "Save Our Most Endangered Species. The Unborn." 
</P>
<P>
* East County bumper sticker: "Pray for Me. I Drive Highway 94." 
</P>
<P>
* Headline in the Lakeside-based Animal Press: "Cruelty-Free Products Now in 
Fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Gee, just when I was beginning to like the off-the-rack look.

'TOP GUN' TURNS HIS SIGHTS ON AN UNRUFFLED BATES; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: DUKE CUNNINGHAM MAY BE THE CONGRESSMAN'S STRONGEST CHALLENGE FOR THE 
44TH DISTRICT SINCE BATES CAME TO OFFICE, BUT THAT MAY MEAN LITTLE WHEN 
NOVEMBER ROLLS AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the highly decorated Navy fighter pilot he once was, Republican 
congressional candidate Randall (Duke) Cunningham often lapses into the 
swaggering, cocky vernacular of his former job to describe his campaign for 
what he hopes will be his new profession. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham dismisses his opponent, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), as "just 
another MiG, and an unethical one." When the two debate, Cunningham predicts, 
he will "shoot down" Bates, "knock him right out of the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the formidable challenge of opposing a four-term incumbent whose 
party holds a more than 3-2 voter registration edge, Cunningham smiles wryly 
and says, "I've come through tougher missions and beaten bigger odds." In 
short, Cunningham views Bates as "a pretty easy target" in their 44th 
Congressional District race. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, however, exudes confidence that he, not Cunningham, will be the "Top 
Gun" in this political battle. Toughened by a bruising June primary campaign 
dominated by debate over Bates' sanction by the House Ethics Committee on 
sexual harassment charges, the former county supervisor and San Diego City 
Council member feels he has already survived his toughest challenge of this 
political year. 
</P>
<P>
"If voters wanted to trade me in, they would have done it in the primary," 
Bates said. "It'll be a tough race, but I'm not sure it's going to be as tough 
as the last couple ones." 
</P>
<P>
Though Bates' southern San Diego district was specifically crafted to be "Repub 
lican-proof" by the state legislators who drew its boundaries, the combination 
of candidate and circumstance has caused Cunningham to be widely seen as 
potentially the strongest challenger to face Bates since he won the newly 
created seat in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most decorated Navy pilots in the Vietnam War -- where he became an 
ace by shooting down five enemy planes -- the 48-year-old Cunningham also 
served as director of Miramar Naval Air Station's "Top Gun" fighter pilot 
school, the inspiration for the popular film of the same name. In 1983, 
Cunningham attracted international headlines when he accompanied an 11-year-old 
California pilot on a trip duplicating Charles Lindbergh's New York-to-Paris 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
A staunch conservative who says he represents "the traditional values lacking 
in Jim Bates," Cunningham capitalized on his celebrity at candidate forums 
during last spring's primary by distributing photos of himself in his flight 
jacket. A Cunningham brochure also showed him with "Top Gun" star Tom Cruise -- 
a photo later pulled when Cruise's agent objected. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Cunningham "one of the better candidates we have around the country," 
Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, 
describes the 44th District race as among the top two dozen congressional 
contests nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders' interest in the race was piqued by the five-candidate primary 
scramble for the GOP nomination, a prize that, as one also-ran's campaign 
manager noted, "normally . . . is worth about as much as a case of smallpox." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence that national GOP leaders believe that Cunningham has a credible 
chance can also be found in the fact that a number of high-profile party 
officials will visit San Diego on his behalf -- the type of commitment rarely 
made in a heavily Democratic district where general elections typically are 
races in name only. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and Michigan Rep. Guy 
Vander Jagt, the NRCC's chairman, appeared at Cunningham fund-raisers here last 
week. Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to do the same later in the 
campaign, and Cunningham aides are negotiating with former President Reagan 
over dates for another major fund-raiser -- events aimed at raising a $400,000 
campaign budget. 
</P>
<P>
Comforted by the district's demographics, Democratic officials have categorized 
Bates' bid for a fifth two-year term as a "third-tier" campaign -- a seemingly 
secure race that will be closely monitored in the event that late special 
assistance is needed. Bates, who hopes to raise about $300,000, benefited from 
a fund-raising visit from House Speaker Thomas Foley here earlier this summer, 
and expects Democratic Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri to also 
make a local appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Cunningham's name recognition and assiduously self-promoted "right 
stuff" image, the GOP's hopes hinge largely on the prospect of a voter backlash 
over Bates' ethical woes -- a possibility that failed to materialize in the two 
races since the charges surfaced late in his 1988 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the House ethics panel rebuked Bates over two female staffers' 
complaints that he sexually harassed them via suggestive remarks and gestures, 
and expected aides in his Washington congressional office to solicit campaign 
contributions, a violation of House rules. 
</P>
<P>
In sending a "letter of reproval" -- the lightest possible punishment -- to 
Bates, the ethics panel ordered him to write personal apologies to the two 
women. Bates also agreed to hire a professional consulting firm to develop 
sensitivity training for him and others in his office concerning attitudes 
toward female employees. 
</P>
<P>
Although the allegations attracted wide press coverage in the closing weeks of 
the 1988 race, Bates turned back Republican Rob Butterfield by a convincing 
60%-37% margin. His challenger in June's Democratic primary, lawyer Byron 
Georgiou, built his uphill campaign around the same issue -- running on the 
slogan "The Democrat We Can Respect" -- but also was trounced, 63%-37%. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by those two lopsided victories, Bates characterizes the incident as 
"old news" with rapidly declining political impact. As he has from the outset, 
Bates attributes the controversy to "some kidding and flirting around," arguing 
that, technically, he was not found guilty, since the reproval letter precluded 
any action by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets less important with each election," said Bates, a scrappy, streetwise 
campaigner. "I don't know how many times in how many campaigns it can be 
brought up, but I'm sure (Cunningham) will try. But if it hasn't changed 
people's minds by now, it never will." 
</P>
<P>
While saying that he does not plan to emphasize the issue, Cunningham pulls no 
rhetorical punches when asked about the topic, which he contends will play a 
significant role in the election's outcome -- the past two races 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is a sexual pervert who's guilty as sin," Cunningham said. "These 
women were violated. I don't need to bring that up because, by now, everybody 
knows what a jerk this guy is. He's a disgrace, unfit for any public office." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing between Bates and Cunningham, voters can look to stark contrasts in 
the two men's personal backgrounds, political philosophies and positions on 
major issues. Two minor candidates -- Libertarian John Wallner and Peace and 
Freedom Party member Donna White -- will also appear on the ballot in the 44th 
District, which covers downtown and southern San Diego, extending from Linda 
Vista south to Otay, and also includes Lemon Grove, National City and Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
While most of Bates' adult life has been spent in public office, Cunningham 
spent most of his in the military, although he was a high school coach and 
teacher before entering the Navy and now heads a small company that markets 
aviation products. 
</P>
<P>
Fiscally conservative but a moderate to liberal on most social issues, Bates 
has compiled a strong environmental record and played a much-publicized role in 
exposing military procurement excesses. In contrast, Cunningham hews to a 
rigidly conservative line on most issues, illustrated by his opposition to 
abortion and gun control, two of many measures on which he differs with Bates. 
</P>
<P>
As highlights of his 7 1/2-year congressional record, Bates points to his 
efforts to tighten military purchasing practices; his sponsorship of key health 
and environmental legislation, and helping to secure funding for expansion of 
the San Diego Trolley, to address the border sewage problem and for other local 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Proud of his heavy emphasis on constituent services, Bates, whose local office 
is open six days a week and who routinely puts in 12-hour days, has taken to 
half-seriously billing himself as "America's hardest-working congressman." 
Critics, however, contend that his emphasis on resolving constituents' problems 
with the federal bureaucracy has minimized Bates' legislative achievements, an 
argument Cunningham underlines by sniping, "A congressman has to do more . . . 
than find lost Social Security checks." 
</P>
<P>
But that attention to what some dismiss as the unglamorous minutiae of his job 
has long been Bates' major political asset. Even in non-election years, the 
49-year-old Bates returns to San Diego on most weekends, spending hours 
politicking door-to-door and attending endless community events. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a great job solidifying his base," conceded primary loser Georgiou. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, meanwhile, stresses in his public appearances that he would like to 
be known as "the education congressman" -- a variation of the theme used by 
George Bush in 1988 -- and also cites drug control as a major objective. A 
frequent speaker in schools in the "Say No to Drugs" program, Cunningham also 
helped Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) draft legislation authorizing the use of 
military forces in controlling illegal drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to compare records, look at the fact that . . . I've never failed 
at anything, whether it was as a coach or teacher or at Top Gun or the 
Pentagon," Cunningham said. "That tells you a lot more than how someone voted 
on this or that. Anyone can push a button. I got things done." 
</P>
<P>
While he hopes to keep Bates on the defensive, Cunningham has had to put out 
several political brush fires of his own. 
</P>
<P>
A former Del Mar resident who moved to an apartment in Chula Vista to enter the 
race, Cunningham now lives in Mission Valley -- though Bates questions, as did 
Cunningham's primary challengers, whether he will remain in the 44th District 
if he loses in November. Cunningham, however, says that his Del Mar house is 
for sale and that he plans to make his permanent home in the 44th District, 
regardless of the election's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary, Cunningham also was embarrassed by an opponent's revelation 
that he did not vote between 1966 and 1988. Pointing out that Cunningham was in 
Vietnam during part of that time, one of his brochures -- responding to what 
some of his aides saw as an attack on his patriotism -- noted that he "voted 
for all of us with his blood." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham also was roundly denounced for a mailer that attacked his major 
primary opponent, Joseph Ghougassian, an Egyptian-born Armenian who served as 
U.S. ambassador to Qatar from 1985 through 1989. Beneath sketches of Libyan 
leader Moammar Kadafi, a Saudi Arabian prince and an oil barrel dripping 
dollars, the mailer accused Ghougassian of being "bought and paid for" by Arab 
oil interests. 
</P>
<P>
After Ghougassian called the mailer "blatant racism" and another GOP candidate 
described it as a "racist, KKK-type attack," national Republican strategist 
Rollins issued a stern public rebuke of his own. In apologizing, Cunningham 
said the brochure was not an attack on Ghougassian's ethnicity, but rather was 
simply intended to point out that he had received campaign donations from 
several Mideast businessmen and oil company representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham hopes to use more recent events in the Middle East, however, to 
boost his candidacy. Believing that the tensions in the Persian Gulf play to 
his strength, he has used the crisis between the United States and Iraq to 
further distinguish his own record from Bates' "defense-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you every weapon (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein has, their range, 
their tactics and our tactics," Cunningham said. "I know which weapons systems 
we should or shouldn't be developing. . . . All Bates wants to do is cut and 
then cut some more, without any real knowledge of what problems that causes. If 
we get into it over there, Jim Bates, by cutting back on defense, is going to 
be directly responsible for losing American lives." 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Taylor, Bates' campaign consultant, argues that, if the Iraqi crisis 
casts a major shadow over the race, the Democratic incumbent will be well 
positioned to address the broader questions posed by it, thanks largely to his 
disclosure of the military procurement gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cunningham's experience might be useful out in the desert, but in Congress I 
want the guy who's cut out the $675 ashtrays so we can spend the money 
efficiently," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly unimpressed with Cunningham's rhetoric, Bates dismisses his GOP 
opponent as someone who "might be happier in an F-14 than in Congress" and a 
"blank check for the military." 
</P>
<P>
"He sounds pretty one-dimensional, doesn't he?" Bates said. "Maybe he ought to 
think about running for secretary of defense instead."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BURGLARS TAKE GOODS VALUED AT $450,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were investigating Sunday the theft of $450,000 worth of 
merchandise from a Westlake marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-printed computer checks, collectors' stamps and at least 325 sketches and 
paintings were taken from M&amp;T Marketing on Lakefield Road about 8 p.m. 
Saturday, when someone pried open the company's rear door, said Lt. Tony 
Ditzhazy of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was in the building when the thieves broke in, Ditzhazy said. Police 
were alerted to the break-in by an automatic burglar alarm, but the thieves had 
escaped by the time deputies arrived, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER FIRES SHOTS AS CAR ALMOST HITS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando police officer fired shots at a car as the driver attempted to 
run him down Sunday morning, police said. Occupants of the car, suspects in an 
earlier stabbing, escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Tom Favazzo was uninjured in the 2:05 a.m. incident in the 11300 block 
of Rincon Avenue. Police did not know if any shots fired by Favazzo hit the 
car's occupants, believed to have been involved in a stabbing in the 1100 block 
of 1st Street about 40 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. William Miron, police found Jesus Campos Bernal Jr., 19, 
stabbed several times, at 1:25 a.m. Bernal was taken to a nearby hospital, 
where he was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 minutes after the stabbing, officers responded to calls of gang 
activity in the 600 block of Chatsworth Street and the 800 block of Mott 
Street. Vehicles seen in those areas matched descriptions of those seen fleeing 
the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped one vehicle and Favazzo pursued a second to a cul-de-sac on 
Rincon Avenue. As Favazzo approached the vehicle, the driver attempted to run 
him down. Favazzo fired at the vehicle, which sped away. Police later found two 
loaded shotguns in the cul-de-sac. No one was arrested in the first car. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for the occupants of the second car Sunday, but did not 
release descriptions of them. 
</P>
<P>
Miron said the shooting will be investigated by Favazzo's supervisor.

Arson investigators are seeking the cause of a blaze that destroyed four 
storage buildings Sunday at a winery in Poway. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Sheriff's Department arson investigation unit listed the fire as 
suspicious in origin. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responded at 4:31 a.m. to the Bernardo Winery at 13330 Paseo del 
Verona Norte in Poway and found four storage buildings at the facility's north 
end engulfed in flames, according to arson unit Sgt. Conrad Grayson. 
</P>
<P>
The storage buildings and their contents were destroyed. Damage was estimated 
at $40,000. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Rizzo, the winery's owner, said the storage buildings contained mostly old 
books and typewriters and that no wine was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo said the fire did not reach the facility's shops, restaurant and wine and 
olive oil producing sections. 
</P>
<P>
"(The fire investigators) have not told me much about what started the fire," 
Rizzo said. "They have been pretty confidential about it."

Go West -- to Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
There goes our plastics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Action West, a coalition of 15 counties in southwestern Michigan, has launched 
business development ads that debase the stereotyped California lifestyle in 
favor of another west coast lifestyle -- the west coast of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The ads, running in trade publications such as Modern Plastics and Food 
Engineering, tout southwestern Michigan as "America's Other West Coast."They 
are aimed at luring businesses to their corner of the Great Lakes State. 
</P>
<P>
One ad is headlined "Imagine a West Coast without all those condos, kooks and 
quakes." Another says, "Imagine a West Coast where plastic is more than just an 
attitude." It is aimed at attracting plastics manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
John Sebestyen, executive vice president of Johnson &amp; Dean, the Grand 
Rapids agency behind the ads, says it's "all done in good fun." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even selling against California," Sebestyen contends. Still, he 
admits, he got a call from a Detroit woman who wanted to know "why we're 
picking on California. I told her, 'I really don't think they're losing a lot 
of sleep over this.' "

2 Barbies for a Mickey Mantle? 
</P>
<P>
Trading cards, once the domain of baseball-crazy boys, are now available to 
girls who love Barbie dolls. Mattel is jumping into the $350-million-a-year 
trading card market in a big way, offering packs of 10 oversized Barbie trading 
cards for $1 and a coordinating poster for $3. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 300 different cards, each with Barbie in a fashionable 
outfit, beginning with her shapely debut in a 1959 striped, one-piece swimsuit. 
"We elected not to add the pink bubble gum, although it would be a natural," 
said Meryl Friedman, vice president of marketing and product development for 
Barbie's lifestyle group. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel predicts that the cards will appeal to mothers and daughters who, for 
three decades, have picked up fashion tips by dressing their Barbie dolls for 
dates with Ken.

Latest Dirt on Rodeo Drive 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Drive has new gardeners, but the change has nothing to do with how well 
the landscaping has looked on the glitzy street. 
</P>
<P>
The switch stemmed from a turn in an ongoing legal battle launched in 1984 by 
the Rodeo Drive Committee, a group of 80 merchants and property owners. To 
protect the Rodeo image, the committee sued an apparel firm that unveiled a 
Rodeo Drive line, accusing it of trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
California Guys N Gals, the apparel firm, countersued and won $180,000 in legal 
fees. The firm then tried to recover some of the money by filing a claim 
against a $40,000 contract under which Beverly Hills was paying the Rodeo 
committee to maintain the street's median. The committee responded by canceling 
the contract and asking the city to do the gardening itself. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Rodeo's landscaping look? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a dirt strip, with dead weeds in it," said Richard Weaver of 
California Guys N Gals. Joan Luther of the Rodeo Drive Committee retorted: "The 
median strip is as bright and beautiful as ever."

The Persian Gulf tension that catapulted oil prices into orbit has yet to send 
drills grinding into the California earth, but oil producers are thinking about 
renewed drilling and are resurrecting wells idled by a plunge in crude oil 
prices five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The price of California crude, a thick grade that requires more refining and in 
normal times fetches $5 to $9 a barrel less than Texas crude, has more than 
doubled since the beginning of August. However, California producers are 
awaiting signs that the higher prices will be sustained before committing new 
dollars to tapping the state's tar-like reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is considerable uncertainty among producers about whether prices will 
remain at the current levels," said Chris Hall, president of Drilling &amp; 
Production Co., a Torrance company with about 70 active wells. "Having 
exhausted much of their capital reserve over the last five years, companies 
have to be reasonably certain current price levels will continue before they 
will risk any capital investment." 
</P>
<P>
Walloped by a steep slide in oil prices in 1985 and 1986, producers say prices 
must hover around today's levels for three to six months before they renew 
large-scale drilling, exploration and advanced recovery techniques. 
</P>
<P>
A 42-gallon barrel from the Kern River field in the San Joaquin Valley, 
California's most prolific reserve and one of the nation's five largest, sold 
for about $22 last week, compared to $9 before Iraq overran Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's likened to you getting a 10% raise for two weeks," said Carol Currie, 
spokeswoman for the California Independent Petroleum Assn. in Yorba Linda. "Are 
you going to run out and buy a swimming pool?" 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that lenders are acting cautious. Banks that financed oil 
exploration and production 10 or 15 years ago were badly burned when prices 
fell in the 1980s. They do not appear eager to commit themselves again. 
</P>
<P>
But producers are scrambling to revive wells that fell victim to California 
crude prices, which plummeted from about $21 a barrel in 1985 to as low as $7 a 
barrel in 1986. Prices had peaked at $26 a barrel in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Facing recovery costs of $8 to $10 a barrel, oil producers idled marginal 
wells, abandoned more expensive secondary recovery methods using water and 
steam, and shelved exploration plans. Many slashed payrolls and became more 
familiar with red ink than black crude. 
</P>
<P>
"Producers have been in the survival mode for the last five years," said Hall, 
who described the period as "hell." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, whose company draws about 300 barrels a day of crude from Kern County 
reserves, closed about a sixth of his wells after prices skidded in 1985-86. He 
cut wages 20% and slashed staff by about a third. 
</P>
<P>
The ill effects reverberated through the oil industry of California, which 
produces about a sixth of the crude pumped in the United States and is the 
fourth-largest oil-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
After peaking in 1985 at around 1.15 million barrels a day, the state's 
production fell sharply in subsequent years, sliding to about 1 million barrels 
a day last year. By March, the most recent month for which figures are 
available, California production had fallen to about 968,000 barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
As production declined, the number of idled wells increased. By March, more 
than 40% of the state's 70,000-plus wells sat idle, up from about 30% in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the surge in prices, if lasting, could reverse the decline, observers said. 
And the independent producers, more agile than integrated giants such as 
Chevron or Shell Oil, probably will benefit first as they beat larger 
competitors to the oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
"We can actually operate a little more economically than the majors, and 
decisions are made with fewer people," explained Terry Smith, general manager 
of Tidelands Oil Production Co. in Long Beach. "We have morning staff meetings 
when we can plan the day's activities or the following day's activities and 
start work the next day." 
</P>
<P>
By last week, Tidelands, an independent company that produces about 10,000 
barrels a day -- mostly from the Long Beach Harbor area -- had scrambled to 
restart 10 wells and was preparing about eight more. Still, about 30% of its 
640 wells were inactive, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Larger companies, although restricted by the need for longer-range planning, 
had also reacted by last week. Chevron, California's second-largest producer, 
said it will spend $20 million by year-end to drill new wells and update others 
in its California fields. The effort, designed after the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, is part of a $100-million nationwide program to boost 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects of a quick recovery for independents and majors, however, are dimmed 
by an infrastructure already straining under renewed demand. After atrophying 
for the past five years, it can't provide enough drilling equipment or revive 
shut-down wells fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't just all of a sudden start throwing oil rigs out there," a Chevron 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Experienced oil workers also are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to hire, but there are just no qualified people," said 
Tideland's Smith, whose company pared its payroll from 350 employees in 1985 to 
250 today. "We would like to be running three more crews on our rigs, but we 
cannot find qualified people to fill the positions." 
</P>
<P>
Sustained high oil prices could prove a savior for independents such as 
Tideland, which have lost chunks of market share to the majors in the past 
decade. Although the big, integrated companies could subsidize lagging 
production during a downturn with everything from refining jet fuel to selling 
candy bars at service stations, the independents have been captive to depressed 
well prices. 
</P>
<P>
That has left the independents providing less than 20% of the state's 
production, down from about a third in 1981. But the surge in oil prices is 
likely to help the smaller companies, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, a lot of our producers were either breaking even or in the 
red," said Currie, the spokeswoman for California independents. "The increase 
in prices is allowing them to pay their bills."

Sales of Wood Stoves Heat Up: Sales of wood stoves are up again as people worry 
about the rising cost of fuel for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news for our industry is that there's been a wake-up call on the 
energy front," said Jim Hermann, president of the Earth Stove Inc. of Portland, 
Ore. Stores that sell wood stoves say they saw interest in the products surge 
almost immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait. In Massachusetts, for example, 
the average price of home heating oil has risen 18 cents per gallon since the 
invasion. While a wood stove can cost $1,000, the low price of wood compared to 
oil translates into savings over the long term.

Machine tool orders tumbled in July because of weak domestic demand, the Assn. 
for Manufacturing Technology said today. 
</P>
<P>
Orders were at $233.75 million in July -- usually a month of weakness -- down 
11.9% from June. Compared to July, 1989, however, they were up 22.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Machine tool orders are hanging tough, considering that July is usually a slow 
month, as many manufacturing plants have summer shutdowns and the auto industry 
is normally in the process of model changeovers," said Albert W. Moore, 
president of the trade association. 
</P>
<P>
July shipments were $233.40 million last month, down 33.4% from June.

OIL FIRM PROFITABILITY FALLS IN 1ST HALF

The profitability of the 20 largest U.S. oil companies fell during the first 
half of the year, the American Petroleum Institute said Sunday, despite a rise 
in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But the companies' prospects are likely to improve dramatically in the second 
half of the year due to the 50% rise in crude prices since the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The API said profit as a percentage of stockholder equity fell to 13.2% from 
15.8% last year. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the decline in profitability was due largely to depressed oil 
prices early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Soaring oil prices since the invasion of Kuwait are expected to boost oil 
company profits the second half of the year. The effects on individual firms 
are expected to vary widely, however, based on whether they earn most of their 
money from pumping oil or refining it into petroleum products. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from continuing operations, which exclude one-time gains or costs, also 
declined in the first six months of the year, as well as in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The API said operating income of the 20 companies during the second quarter was 
$4.0 billion, compared to $4.5 billion a year ago, an 11% drop. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income during the first six months was $8.1 billion, compared to $8.9 
billion during the first six months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the 20 companies were up during both the second quarter and the 
first six months. In the second quarter, they totaled $94.9 billion, 2% higher 
than the $93 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues during the first half of the year totaled $194 billion, 6.4% higher 
than the $182.4 billion in revenues during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 companies in the analysis were Amerada Hess Corp., American Petrofina 
Inc., Amoco Corp., Ashland Oil Inc., Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp., 
Diamond Shamrock, Exxon Corp., Kerr-McGee Corp., Maxus Energy Corp., Mobil 
Corp., Murphy Oil Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Oryx Energy Co., Pennzoil 
Co., Phillips Petroleum Co., Shell Oil Co., Sun Co Inc., Texaco and Unocal.

JUNK BOND DEFAULTS AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN 20 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE FAILURE RATE ON HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES HAS BEEN 5.8% SO FAR THIS 
YEAR.

<P>
Junk bond defaults rose in the first half of 1990 to a rate that, if sustained 
the rest of the year, would generate the highest corporate bond default rate in 
20 years, an investment service says. 
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of the year, 32 high-yield bond issuers defaulted -- 
a default rate of 5.8%, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's 
Investor Service Inc. 
</P>
<P>
If maintained, it would be the highest default rate since the collapse of the 
Penn Central railroad accounted for a 10.9% rate in 1970, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a weak economy and higher oil prices make it a good possibility 
that the near-record default rate this year will be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
As the economy slows and higher gasoline and heating oil prices leave consumers 
with less money to spend in casinos, department stores and on new homes, 
businesses will have less cash to make interest and principal payments, Lonski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've passed the bottom yet in all likelihood, especially for 
the highly leveraged firms that depend on discretionary income," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of issues that usually ride up and down with the business cycle have 
taken a pounding since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, causing oil prices to 
skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers compiled by Citicorp show that returns on junk bonds issued by 
recession-prone industries suffered the most in the first half of August. 
Casinos dropped 7.8%, building materials fell 7.1% and retailers were off 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Toilet maker American Standard Inc., which relies heavily on energy in making 
its ceramics, saw its 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures, which mature in 
the year 2000, skid from 93 to the high 80s last week. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are debt securities typically issued by companies that lack 
investment-grade credit. Often used to raise capital for expansion, they carry 
high interest rates to compensate for their risk. 
</P>
<P>
A recession would hit steeply leveraged companies particularly hard because 
their fixed costs include huge principal and interest payments, Lonski said. 
When looking to cut expenses, capital spending and employment are likely to be 
hit harder than if a company didn't have a high debt obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Even industries such as food, tobacco and health care, whose fortunes tend to 
resist economic downturns, could be hurt as consumers resist price hikes that 
heavily indebted companies have relied upon to boost cash flow, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp's numbers show returns on health-care issues dropping 0.9% and 
broadcasting issues 1.7% in the first half of August. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the coin, there are likely to be some bond-issuing winners 
in the post-Iraqi invasion climate. One segment, Lonski said, is utilities that 
rely heavily on nuclear power to produce electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Public Service Co. and Philadelphia Electric Co. are examples of 
utilities with speculative-grade bonds that have substantial nuclear-power 
generating capabilities, he said.

U.S. Probes Alleged TV Dumping: The Commerce Department said it has opened an 
inquiry into whether Asian and Canadian television makers are trying to avoid a 
U.S. "anti-dumping" ruling on selling color television tubes in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The agency ruled in 1988 that companies in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and 
Canada were selling the sets with the tubes at below cost. In making the 
ruling, it assessed anti-dumping duties. A coalition of U.S. color tube makers 
and their unions asked the department to see if the firms were skirting 
anti-dumping duties by having the sets assembled in Mexico.

War, or even the threat of it, is always hell for the stock market. And if it 
brings inflation and recession rather than an economic tonic, it could be 
anguishing indeed for investors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the market can rebound nicely after the onset of war -- as it did in 
World War II and the Korean conflict -- the Mideast hostilities that started 
with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait could usher in a punishing bear market, 
some stock watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is being perceived as real, with the potential for being 
prolonged, and raising inflation throughout the world," said Ken Ackbarali, 
senior economist with First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A long Mideast standoff or a war, he added, would drive many investors out of 
the stock market entirely and into investments that they viewed as safer, such 
as Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
Markets generally dive when war clouds gather, analysts said last week. "What 
happens is that the first reaction in crisis is sell, because there's nothing 
like cash in an emergency," said Michael Metz, a market strategist with the 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment firm in New York. "Then they take a second 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices plunged at the start of World War II and the Korean conflict. But 
within months in those cases the market embarked on long rallies, as the 
country ramped up its war effort and the economy reaped the benefits of 
stimulative spending. 
</P>
<P>
In the current situation, analysts said, even a second look might not provoke 
investors to bound optimistically back into this market. That would be 
especially true if it appears that the United States will begin shooting it out 
with Iraqi forces in the Middle Eastern desert oil fields, thereby threatening 
a massive disruption of world oil markets. 
</P>
<P>
Since just before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Dow Jones industrial index has 
fallen 12.6% to 2,532.92. 
</P>
<P>
In times of crisis starting with World War II, the stock market has tended to 
slump for six to eight weeks, with the Dow index dropping 12% to 22%, according 
to a New York securities broker whose firm did not want him quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
Once past the urgent selling, the fever has generally been broken with what the 
broker called a "9-to-1 reversal day." On this pivotal day, the volume of 
rising stocks exceeds those of falling stocks by a ratio of 9 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices often sink lower after that, but the market is usually more 
tranquil and a recovery then begins in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in World War II. As the war got under way in Europe, the U.S. 
markets slumped. When the German army rolled across France in May, 1940, panic 
selling sent the Dow down 25% in a single month. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1941, the Sunday bombing of Pearl Harbor and entry of the United 
States into the war sent one key stock index down 4.4% that Monday, and 3.2% 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Those were "quite large drops," said David M. Cutler, a researcher with the 
National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., and co-author of a 
study on what moves stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow bottomed out in April, 1942, at 92. Late that year, however, the U.S. 
victory at Guadalcanal restored optimism that the Allies would win the war, and 
the market headed into a bullish phase that brought the Dow to a top in 
mid-1946 of 212 points. 
</P>
<P>
War was "a clear-cut positive" for the market, said Arnold Kaufman, editor of 
Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook, an investment advisory publication in New York. 
Gearing up for battle yanked the economy out of depression. 
</P>
<P>
Another bull market began in 1949, interrupted briefly by the outbreak of 
hostilities in Korea the next June. After a two-month hiccup, the market bobbed 
steadily upward until peaking in late 1953 at 300. 
</P>
<P>
President John F. Kennedy's October, 1962, confrontation with the Soviets over 
shipments of missiles to Cuba was the next military crisis to face the markets. 
But it was short-lived, with the market plunging 2.67% one day in panic 
selling, only to rebound 3.22% the next when the Soviets sent a letter 
stressing their desire for peace. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to measure how the nation's decade-long presence in Vietnam 
affected the markets. Throughout that period, beginning with the official U.S. 
entry in 1964, the glum nation was beset by economic woes and civil strife as 
the war dragged on. The market bounced around, with the Dow bottoming in May, 
1970, at 631 and peaking in January, 1973, at 1,051. 
</P>
<P>
Yale Hirsch, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac in Old Tappan, N.J., 
likens the current crisis to the 1973 Yom Kippur war and the ensuing decision 
by Arab oil producers to embargo the United States because of its support of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"That caught us by surprise," Hirsch said. The Dow index sank 20% from October 
to December, and the market continued to take a beating as the nation dived 
into recession in 1974 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The second oil shock occurred in 1979, when Iran's revolution briefly cut off 
that nation's oil shipments to the West. 
</P>
<P>
And what about a "third oil shock," should war erupt in the Mideast? 
</P>
<P>
"There's real reason to be concerned," said Daniel B. Nelson, an assistant 
professor of econometrics and finance at the University of Chicago. "If a 
shooting war lasted very long, that would be very bad for the economy and the 
markets."

CONFLICT AND THE DOW 
</P>
<P>
Compiled by Melanie Pickett

The uncertainty surrounding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has sent an already 
uneasy stock market into further confusion in recent weeks. A look at the Dow 
Jones industrial index during earlier conflicts may provide a few insights of 
what might be ahead for the market. (The market during the 10-year Vietnam 
conflict was omitted because it showed no clear trend).

STEVEN BERKOFF'S MACHISMO DIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most men on location in Acapulco, filming something as mindless as "Rambo II," 
would probably spend their off hours with a margarita or a Magdalena on the 
beach, or drowning the bad taste by bellying up to a bar and letting it go at 
that. But Steven Berkoff isn't most men and he doesn't let things go. So he 
wrote a play instead -- not about the making of "Rambo II," but about the 
extras and bit players and blow-hards with whom he traded chatter at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Berkoff has called "Acapulco," which he directed and which opened Saturday at 
the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, "a painted study of people's moods and spirits." 
That's putting a poetic face on it. Scratch "Acapulco" (not too deeply) and 
you'll find it to be the stuff of locker-room conversations. There are two ways 
to look at a play that offers that: as a merely tiresome and offensive 
avalanche of male machismo absurdissimo or the way playwright Berkoff chooses 
to see it -- as a humorous (read affectionate) portrait of lost boys with no 
other subject of conversation than sex, sex, sex and women as its object. 
</P>
<P>
Pathetic? Well, that, unfortunately, is the third totally valid way of looking 
at it. Combined with the first (tiresome and offensive), it can be deadly. If 
you think you fall into this category, "Acapulco" is not for you. But no matter 
how hard Berkoff tries to paint a grotesque raunchy/funny picture, this most 
vivid and original of sometimes indulgent writers can't help coming up with 
some gems. True, he has given most of the best speeches to his alter-ego, the 
Steve character at the bar (John Horn), who is just aloof enough, bemused 
enough and tipsy enough to jump into the conversation at choice moments with 
choice words. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of this rogues' gallery is far less appealing. It includes a whining 
Brooklynite self-hater named Will (Tom Flynn), an English-speaking cipher 
living in Mexico named John (Michael Sollenberger), a tough-talking Yugoslav 
braggart named Voyo (Richard Vidan), an inscrutable bartender (Sam Vlahos 
a.k.a. Sam Markis) and Karen (Chandra Lee), an American bimbo, surely descended 
of Lady Bracknell, who has an ongoing screaming fit about losing her handbag. 
Let it be noted here that this is an equal-opportunity play; women have as much 
right as men to be on their worst behavior. 
</P>
<P>
In typical Berkoff fashion, Craig E. Lathrop's setting is simple -- an 
unembellished bar that straddles the width of the stage, with a giant sketch of 
Stallone as Rambo above it. The characters schmooze, complain, show off and 
swing in and out of reality, talking to the audience as they might to 
themselves. The switching is subtle, effected mostly by slight shifts in Doc 
Ballard's lighting. Importantly featured in the background is a melancholy 
musical thread composed by Rory Anton that underscores the poetry and offsets 
pulchritude. 
</P>
<P>
"Acapulco" is not, however, your typical Berkoff play. It is, for one thing, 
linear and, unlike "Kvetch" or "Greek," very nearly naturalistic. It feels like 
what it is: the dramatization of a personal journal. The result is episodic 
with a series of arias that find only their own culminations. 
</P>
<P>
Within this framework, Horn, who gives an uncanny performance as a Berkoff 
look-alike and sound-alike, has some great speeches, in particular an account 
of the making of the documentary of "Rambo II," which puts the puny barflies in 
their place and him at the head of the class. Those barflies have their moments 
too -- one anyway, when Vidan, Flynn and Sollenberger indulge in a joint 
imitation of Rod Steiger in the taxicab scene from "On the Waterfront." But 
their characters are intrinsically shoddy, which is part of the play's problem. 
The evening officially belongs to Horn, through whose observations and 
reactions we receive not only a sense of the event, but a composite, lyrical 
image of the good and bad of Mexico as well. 
</P>
<P>
A final word: This writer missed the first 10 minutes of the play because of 
failing to register the 7:30 p.m. Saturday starting time. Apologies to all, but 
especially to Lee, who has her biggest moment at the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Thursdays and Fridays, 8:30 p.m.; Saturdays and 
Sundays, 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $17.50-$22; (213) 477-2055.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEXT ON 'OPRAHUE,' THAT WACKY IRAQI HIMSELF ... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A.M. Los Angeles" arrived a little late on KABC-TV Channel 7 Friday because of 
an ABC update from Peter Jennings on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
When the show did come on, co-hosts Steve Edwards and Tawny Little briefly 
discussed the news and Iraq President Saddam Hussein: "This bozo, this complete 
idiot, this maniac!" said Little, angrily. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Hussein was a TV segue from heaven, for Little and Edwards 
then proceeded to cite the just incredible similarities between the gulf crisis 
and "Delta Force 2." That's the new Chuck Norris action movie ("The bad news . 
. . America is losing another battle. The good news . . . the Delta Force is 
going to war") that Norris was booked on the show to promote. 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . Steve, Tawny and Chuck were all sort of open-mouthed: Hussein is 
holding hostages; the Norris nemesis in "Delta Force 2," a drug czar, holds 
Drug Enforcement Agency agents hostage. "In fact, it's sort of amazing," Norris 
added later in his low-key way, "but in our film, the cocaine kingpin kills 
people with chemicals . . . mustard gas." 
</P>
<P>
You got the impression that this was either a coincidence or that Hussein had 
an agent inside MGM and had gotten his ideas from the script for "Delta Force 
2." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards asked Norris what he thought President Bush should do about Hussein. 
The actor wasn't really sure what to do about this Iraqi "nut case." Based on 
its approving cheers and applause when one possible course of action was 
suggested, however, the studio audience was absolutely sure what Bush should 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Send in Chuck Norris! 
</P>
<P>
What an inspired tie-in to the gulf crisis. If only other shows were as smart 
and inventive as "A.M. Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they need some suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* "Donahue" -- Transvestite troops are the theme. Phil travels to Saudi Arabia 
to personally check out rumors of widespread secret cross-dressing by Marines. 
</P>
<P>
* "Geraldo" -- Appearing in silhouette, Mafia hit men tell how they would take 
out Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
* "Joan Rivers" -- Network anchors reporting on the Persian Gulf crisis: Do 
they color their hair? 
</P>
<P>
* "Oprah" -- Psychologists speculate on how many U.S. military officers were 
child-abuse victims and whether their parents were overweight alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
* "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- Psychotic mothers of sailors talk about their love 
affairs with men they tried to poison. 
</P>
<P>
* "Donahue" -- Zsa Zsa Gabor tells Phil what she will do to Saddam Hussein if 
he ever issues her a traffic ticket. Then six women tell Phil why they suspect 
their bisexual husbands of being Iraqi spies. 
</P>
<P>
* "Geraldo" -- Desert hookers with hearts of gold. 
</P>
<P>
* "Joan Rivers" -- Desert gossip. 
</P>
<P>
* "Oprah" -- What's really behind that veil? Beauty experts comment on the 
possibility that the real reason some Arab women wear veils is to hide 
skin-care problems. 
</P>
<P>
* "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- The same beauty experts express alarm about 
potential moisturizing problems faced by female military in the desert heat.

ART: 'THE WAY TO POLITICAL PLURALISM' AT THE MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION, ONCE A

Banners proclaiming "Down With the Communist Party" and "Market Economy -- Yes" 
now line museum walls long reserved for propaganda about the victory of 
Marxist-Leninist ideals in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
A new exhibit, "The Way to Political Pluralism," is on view in the Museum of 
the Revolution, which until recently had been the showcase for the Soviet 
leader of the day to force his ideas on the children who filed through by the 
thousands on school trips. 
</P>
<P>
Topics now on display include the political life of scientist and human rights 
campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, the refugees from ethnic strife across the 
country, the fast-growing environmental movement and the drives for 
independence in the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very stormy political life in our country right now," said Svetlana 
V. Lifanova, 45, the historian in charge of exhibit. "Many people do not have 
clear ideas of the political forces battling for power. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped to show them the stormy political life and give people an opportunity 
to compare different political platforms and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the materials on display here could have brought their owners 
seven years in prison for anti-Soviet propaganda not long ago, Lifanova said 
the Museum of the Revolution is the obvious place for such an exhibition today. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev calls this a revolution -- although it 
is a peaceful revolution," she said. "There really is a revolution going on, 
especially in the consciousness of the people." 
</P>
<P>
But for museum-goers, such political heresy in a setting that was once a shrine 
to the Bolsheviks, their revolution and their party is hugely ironic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very funny for a Soviet person to see this," said Masha M. Voltenstein, a 
physicist, "because we are used to things in museums having absolutely no 
connection with reality." 
</P>
<P>
Items on display ranged from the flag of Pamyat, a Russian nationalist group 
with anti-Semitic leanings, to ration coupons for sugar and a telegram to the 
liberal Inter-Regional Group of Deputies to the national parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are behind you. Down with the 6th Article. Create a party," the 
telegram read. Delivered at the Kremlin, the telegram was sent by a Muscovite 
to encourage the liberal legislators to delete from the constitution the 
article guaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role in the life of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Once-banned flags, anti-Communist newspapers, platforms of new political 
parties and photographs of the most controversial recent events filled the 
exhibit, which is scheduled to remain in place for at least four more months. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is so up-to-date that it even has materials from July's 28th party 
congress, including a political cartoon lampooning the battle between 
conservatives and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
In the cartoon, discredited Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid I. Brezhnev 
are standing in front of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses. Stalin whispers to 
Brezhnev, "Our guys still aren't surrendering," in an obvious illusion to the 
hard-liners' stubborn refusal to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
The preparation of the exhibit itself shows how much change there has been 
since 1987, when the museum was still a custodian of the official line on the 
past and curators were prevented from getting their hands on archival material 
such as documents about Stalin's victims. 
</P>
<P>
"At last, we don't have to hide anything," said Lifanova, who has worked at the 
museum for 21 years. "Before, history was seen through the prism of party 
ideology. This is the historic truth we have always dreamed about." 
</P>
<P>
For the exhibit on political pluralism, a group of museum historians gathered 
authentic materials of the current political scene. Banners used in recent 
demonstrations are on display. Ration coupons were collected from around the 
country. Some of the photographs of the recent ethnic clashes were taken by 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
One banner is at the expense of former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, who often 
boasted that the Soviet Union would excel in every imaginable category, both 
important and mundane. The banner reads, "We will catch up and overtake America 
in the quantity of milk and will catch up with and overtake America in the 
quantity of political parties." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has already achieved that goal: More than 20 new political 
parties and organizations were represented at the exhibit alone. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors were visibly affected as they viewed the roll-call vote that spelled 
the end of the Communist Party's monopoly, notes legislators had scrawled to 
themselves and casual photographs of popular heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really unusual," Igor A. Sviridov, 54, an unemployed metalworker, said 
while viewing material on the Ukrainian independence movement. "It's the first 
time I've seen many of these things. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lenin were here, he would call Lubyanka and have this closed down and all 
those involved thrown in jail," Sviridov said, using the slang name for the 
offices of the KGB, the Soviet security police.

WOOSTER GROUP NOT TEMPTED BY CONVENTIONALITY; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE EXPERIMENTAL-THEATER TROUPE HAS JUMBLED-UP FLAUBERT FOR ITS 'FRANK 
DELL'S THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY.'

<P>
Wearing dark glasses, sandals and a bathrobe, the central character of "Frank 
Dell's the Temptation of St. Anthony" stands under a spotlight muttering into a 
microphone. Calling out instructions to an unseen engineer, he obsessively 
plays and replays scenes from a cable-TV nude talk show visible on a row of 
monitors above his head, dubbing in all the voices himself like a video 
ventriloquist. The dialogue these embarrassed-looking nudists spout ranges from 
banal chitchat to metaphysical ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
What is going on here? 
</P>
<P>
To help decode this mystifying tableau, the program has provided a few clues. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Dell," it turns out, was a name sometimes used by the late stand-up 
comic Lenny Bruce. "The Temptation of St. Antony" is Gustave Flaubert's 1874 
dramatic poem about the 3rd-Century saint who spent most of his life fasting in 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Logic has it that the actor on stage is some combination of the two and the 
weird pictures on the TV set must be the profane comic's drug-induced 
hallucinations mixed with the hermetic saint's hunger-induced visions. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. But the stage is full of other bizarre elements. What's that 
crazy cocktail piano music all about? Who are those three women doing corny 
magic routines, quoting Stevie Nicks and performing their "Queen of Sheba" 
dance? And what about the video of a bunch of exotically dressed people in a 
hotel room standing around a corpse and poking it with a stick? 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Wooster Group. 
</P>
<P>
After winning acclaim during the 1987 Los Angeles Festival with "The Road to 
Immortality: Part Two (. . . Just the High Points . . .)," the New York-based 
experimental-theater troupe returns to Los Angeles this week for six 
performances of "Frank Dell's the Temptation of St. Anthony," the conclusion of 
its "Road to Immortality" trilogy. Presented by the Los Angeles Festival in 
partnership with the Museum of Contemporary Art at the Temporary Contemporary, 
the five performances at MOCA beginning Friday are already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
The Wooster Group is something of a curiosity, revered by a fanatical cult 
following yet largely unknown to mainstream audiences -- perhaps contemporary 
theater's counterpart to the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the group's mystique derives from its sheer longevity as one of the few 
theater companies in America that have stuck together for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The evolutionary outgrowth of Richard Schechner's Performance Group, one of the 
foremost Off-Broadway theaters of the 1960s, the Wooster Group is a mixed-media 
ensemble of five principle actors, designer Jim Clayburgh, and numerous 
associates, all under the direction of Elizabeth LeCompte. Together, they have 
created seven major theater pieces since 1975 in a career fueled by controversy 
and contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
Hometown critics have been decidedly cool to the group's visually oriented, 
aggressively non-narrative work, yet it has been hailed at festivals across 
Europe as the pride of the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of racism arising from the group's use of blackface in "Route 1 &amp; 
9" (Part 1 of "The Road to Immortality") led to a reduction of its funding from 
the New York State Council for the Arts in 1982, yet the Wooster Group was one 
of the first recipients of the National Endowment for the Arts' Ongoing 
Ensembles grants aimed at supporting long-term theatrical collaborations. 
</P>
<P>
The company creates and premieres its work at a tiny converted garage in New 
York's SoHo district, yet three of its members have become renowned in motion 
pictures: Spalding Gray ("Swimming to Cambodia"), Willem Dafoe ("Platoon," "The 
Last Temptation of Christ," "Wild at Heart"), and Ron Vawter ("sex, lies, and 
videotape"). 
</P>
<P>
Those who saw the Wooster Group in 1987 will be familiar with the company's 
fast-paced, exhilarating, abrasive theatrical collage. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Just the High Points . . ." juxtaposed the teachings of Timothy Leary -- 
fractured through the reminiscences of his suburban Boston baby-sitter Ann 
Rower -- with a fast-forwarded adaptation of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible." 
</P>
<P>
For all its playfulness and disjointed narrative, ". . . Just the High Points . 
. ." seriously examined American culture's spiritual malaise, the erosion of 
moral certainty in the search for higher consciousness. In its multilayered 
structure "St. Anthony" perpetuates the same theatrical style. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, there are many connections between the two pieces," LeCompte says. 
"I'm writing with the same vocabulary. In some ways I've shifted -- it's like 
I'm not using a ballpoint this time but a scroll pen -- but all the same 
essential ideas are there." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, nothing quite prepares viewers for the spectacle of "St. 
Anthony." Unlike the established American classics that other Wooster group 
pieces were based on, ("Long Day's Journey Into Night," "Our Town," "The 
Crucible"), Flaubert's densely poetic, virtually unstageable drama about the 
3rd-Century saint will be obscure to the vast majority of theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
As if Flaubert's mad fantasia of the hermit saint were not enough, LeCompte and 
her actors have jumbled up the text with two other sources. The storyline comes 
from Ingmar Bergman's film, "The Magician," in which a troupe of second-rate 
magicians escape from house arrest when they're asked to perform for the King 
of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The real guiding spirit of the piece is Lenny Bruce, whose stand-up routines 
and passages from Albert Goldman's biography make their way into the piece. 
</P>
<P>
If controversy attends the Wooster Group in Los Angeles, it may center on the 
question of what this all-white group from New York is doing in the midst of a 
festival celebrating Pacific cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The connection would probably be clearer if, as originally intended, the group 
were supplementing performances of "St. Anthony" with previews of its 
work-in-progress, "Brace Up," an adaptation of Chekhov's "Three Sisters" that 
incorporates Japanese theater techniques and Pacific Island dances from Wallis 
and Futuna. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan was for the festival and the museum to present the complete 
"Road to Immortality" trilogy, as well as "Brace Up." Practical considerations 
-- lack of money -- intervened. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the Wooster Group had the only connection really necessary 
to be part of the 1990 Los Angeles Festival: Director Peter Sellars, who did 
some fast, last-minute fund-raising when budget cuts threatened to remove the 
Wooster Group from the festival lineup altogether. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime champion of their work, Sellars has presented the company during his 
directorships of the Boston Shakespeare Company and the American National 
Theater in Washington; it was, in fact, Sellars who proposed that the group 
undertake to stage Gustave Flaubert's "The Temptation of St. Antony." 
</P>
<P>
"Oddly," LeCompte says, "I think this piece will be more understandable to 
people in Los Angeles than in New York." In California, she explains, spiritual 
fulfillment and movie stardom are pursued with equal ardency. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side of Flaubert's Europe is Hollywood, and I always felt this piece 
formed an arc between the two poles. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the pieces we've done, this is the most polarized in its cultural 
references. I've set two systems against one another: Hollywood image-making, 
television, pop culture, where what you see is what you get; and high culture 
of Europe, the examination of the spiritual idea. 
</P>
<P>
"You have Hilarion the devil played on video by Willem Dafoe floating around 
working as an actor, and Flaubert's St. Anthony, a spiritual man questing in a 
cave someplace in Egypt. Somewhere, for me, the circle is completed." 
</P>
<P>
As an ensemble, the Wooster Group has the luxury of spending months at a time 
developing their work, but even by such leisurely standards, "St. Anthony" had 
a longer gestation period: eight months of rehearsal spread over three years. 
</P>
<P>
It came out of asking the hardest questions, LeCompte says: "Questions so hard, 
I can't find the words for them. They have to do with the spirit and the flesh, 
death and lust, what you believe in and how you believe. In 'St. Antony,' 
Flaubert is obsessed with death, so I got obsessed with death in a sensual way, 
loving it, embracing it. Looking back now, we can't believe we did it."

ISRAELI CARD: White House officials are girding for the possibility of 
increased tensions with Israel as Iraq's Saddam Hussein escalates his military 
threats to Jordan and neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants the Israelis to sit tight and not unleash their own attack 
against Iraq if Saddam sends troops to Jordan, as he has threatened to do. 
Israel has warned before that it would retaliate against Baghdad if the Iraqis 
attacked Jordan, which is on Israel's border. But Bush Administration 
strategists fear that any such sortie would reunite the Arab bloc and upset the 
balance that is supporting U.S. forces in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Attacking Jordan is Saddam's wild card," one senior American official said. 
"He wants to pull in the Israelis and re-establish Arab unity. It's the last 
thing we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
BAKER'S DISSENT?: Secretary of State James A. Baker III's low profile during 
the past week of the Iraqi crisis has spawned new speculation that he may not 
fully support what President Bush is doing in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was conspicuously absent from some of Bush's most important strategy 
sessions at Kennebunkport, Me., earlier this month, letting National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Baker aides insist that the secretary's absence stemmed more from his vacation 
plans. And State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, seeking to blunt 
speculation about his boss's misgivings, took pains to tell reporters that 
Baker has been busy telephoning foreign ministers of U.S. allies, and had 
spoken to the President twice on Friday alone. The denials were supported by 
top Bush aides. "If you look at how (Baker) has been working, he's a key 
component of our policy," a Baker loyalist asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, one low-level official complained that the secretary's main -- 
virtually his only -- interest, these days, is the Soviet Union. "He seems to 
talk to (Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze and no one else," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
DRUG RELIEF: Bush's decision to send troops to the Middle East is being greeted 
with enthusiasm -- and perhaps with relief -- by one group: the kingpins of the 
Latin American drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the military had been paying increased attention to 
drug interdiction, partly as a way of employing American forces following the 
end of the Cold War with the Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Now, intelligence analysts say, with AWACS planes and other surveillance 
aircraft redeployed to the Persian Gulf, drug kingpins have begun spreading the 
word that it may be time to reintensify smuggling efforts. 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET ACCORD: President Bush finally may have found a fitting incentive to 
prod White House and congressional budget negotiators into hammering out an 
agreement to reduce the federal budget deficit: He's planning to lock them in a 
room until they do. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say the lawmakers have accepted an invitation to hold 
the next round of budget talks -- scheduled for Sept. 6 and Sept. 7 -- locked 
in a hangar or barracks at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear whether White House officials would allow the 
negotiators to leave if they fail to reach a deficit-reduction agreement this 
time. From the Times Washington Staff

ALLENBY BRIDGE, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and Iraq streamed westward across the 
Jordan River on Sunday, a senior Israeli government official promised to 
expedite the flow of those returning to the West Bank from the Persian Gulf 
crisis area. 
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Goren, occupied territories coordinator, paid a visit to this historic 
crossing place between Jordan and the West Bank and declared that Israel would 
"obviously help" any foreign citizens wishing to pass this way. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli immigration authorities at the terminal of the stubby, 
ramshackle bridge over the almost-dry Jordan River near the entrance to the 
Dead Sea would ease restrictions on entering Israeli-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
Goren said several nations had sounded out Israel about using the Allenby 
Bridge to relieve the jam at the international airport in Jordan's capital of 
Amman and the airfield and port at Aqaba on the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
But the official also said that Israel, during the impending harvest season, 
would crack down on any effort to truck West Bank food supplies across the 
Allenby Bridge into Jordan with Iraq as the ultimate intended destination. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980-88 Persian Gulf War between Iran and Iraq, West Bank growers 
sent much of their produce -- mainly fruits and vegetables -- across the river 
into Jordan where it was transshipped to then-landlocked Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Reports have circulated recently that farmers on the West Bank are continuing 
to ship food ostensibly to Jordan, but which is rerouted overland to Baghdad, 
Iraq's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, reports suggest that foodstuffs arriving in Christian ports in 
neighboring Lebanon are forwarded through Syria to Jordan, where they are 
transferred to Iraq-bound trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Goren said Sunday that the Israeli government would investigate the final 
destination of food shipments and crack down, particularly during the major 
harvest season a few weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear we won't allow any exports to Iraq," said Goren. 
</P>
<P>
In his visit to the Allenby Bridge, Goren hoped to call attention to the plight 
of the Palestinians returning from Kuwait and Iraq, where hundreds of thousands 
have worked during the past two decades and sent much of their paychecks home. 
</P>
<P>
The preponderant majority of Palestinians in the occupied territories and in 
Israel itself have supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of 
Kuwait and are opposed to American troops defending Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Returning Palestinians told of the chaos in Kuwait, with Egyptian and Sudanese 
laborers sleeping in mosques. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Bethlehem said the situation in Kuwait was "very bad, very 
dangerous," adding that food was scarce and expensive.

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a diplomatic settlement were raised Sunday as the U.N. secretary 
general's office announced an impending meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar will meet with Aziz on 
Thursday in Amman, Jordan, for "a full exchange of views on the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, defiant Western diplomats held out in Kuwait despite Iraqi orders to 
leave and cutoffs of electricity and water to the embassies. Iraq allowed 52 
dependents of personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait to head for freedom in 
Turkey, but turned three others back at the border, and continued to round up 
more Westerners in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>

Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from 50 more Army Reserve and National Guard units were called up to 
assist in Operation Desert Shield, the Pentagon announced one day after calling 
up more than 100 naval reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also announced that Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf has established his 
command headquarters in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, part of the Army's 13th Corps 
Support Command from Ft. Hood,Tex., wasarriving in the Middle East to join more 
than 40,000 U.S. troops already on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers began emergency talks in Vienna and were expected to approve 
a temporary increase in oil output to offset losses caused by the crisis in the 
gulf. Representatives from all the 13 member nations except Iraq and Libya were 
present. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC, which pumps about 40% of the world's crude oil, controls prices by 
regulating production. Venezuelan Oil Minister Celestino Armas proposed not 
only increased oil production, but also the release of strategic oil reserves 
held by the United States and other countries.

AMERICAN, YOUNG SON TELL OF HARROWING ESCAPE

It wasn't the quicksand that was so frightening. Or the sandstorms. Or the oil 
pipelines that loomed suddenly out of the blowing sand. 
</P>
<P>
It was the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were afraid the tanks would fire at us and that would be it," said Bassam 
Mohtady, an American who, with his 8-year-old son, crossed the Kuwaiti desert 
in a caravan of vehicles led by a local Bedouin guide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like cat and mouse in the desert," added Mohtady, 34, who arrived with 
his son, Sammer, in Boston on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-vehicle caravan left Kuwait city at 6 a.m. on Aug. 16. Twelve hours 
later, only six vehicles crossed into Saudi Arabia. Mohtady said he does not 
know the fate of the 60 other travelers -- mostly Kuwaitis, Egyptians and 
Saudis -- who did not make it to the border. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait 24 days ago, thousands of Kuwaitis and foreign 
nationals have risked the perils of the desert to escape the Iraqi occupation. 
Not all have survived. 
</P>
<P>
"We passed by abandoned cars, some with bodies in them," Mohtady, manager of 
the World Book Encyclopedia office in Kuwait city, recalled in a telephone 
interview from his home in Saugus, Mass. But "no one was willing to stop" to 
find out how they died, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first four vehicles dropped out of the caravan in a sandstorm a few hours 
into the trip. Others became so hopelessly mired in quicksand that the power of 
three Jeeps could not extricate them. Some simply decided that the dunes and 
hardscrabble desert were too dangerous and turned around. 
</P>
<P>
But Mohtady, driving in a Jeep with his son, a Kuwaiti professor and the 
professor's two American children, kept on. His passengers played electronic 
games to pass the time and drank cold water to offset the 130-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
They traversed deep ditches dug by the Iraqis to prevent escaping vehicles from 
going farther. They drove for miles along oil pipelines looking for places 
where enough sand had piled up against the 3-foot-high pipes so that the 
caravan could cross over. 
</P>
<P>
The worst moment came when the caravan was surrounded by Iraqi tanks. "They had 
a big circle around us," Mohtady's son, Sammer, recalled. But a providential 
sandstorm rose up off the desert, obscured the Jeeps and cars from the tank's 
viewfinders, "and we just went through them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The caravan did not escape gunfire, however. As the few remaining vehicles 
approached the Kuwaiti border, an Iraqi Jeep patrol opened fire on them with 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Although bullets broke Mohtady's windows, no one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After passing through the Saudi border checkpoint, the caravan split up. 
Mohtady drove on to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where he abandoned the 
Jeep and bought tickets home to the States. He and his son were greeted by his 
wife, Kathleen, when they arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtady, who was born in Kuwait but is a naturalized American citizen, said he 
ventured the escape in part because of frustration with the options available. 
The day before he left, the U.S. Embassy held a meeting in which Americans were 
advised to sit tight and keep in touch with each other by telephone. Mohtady 
had been serving as a warden responsible for staying in contact with 17 other 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Mohtady became disheartened. "I was putting so much hope on 
them (the embassy) to get us out of there," he recalled. "But since they had no 
plans to get us out of there, I had to make my own." 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he left 10 days earlier, no Americans were suffering from 
food shortages and were mostly free to travel within the city. Kuwaitis and 
foreigners alike were congregating in a few apartments with family and friends 
and most homes were abandoned. The day Mohtady left, Iraq ordered foreigners to 
report to hotels, although most ignored the order. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two weeks of the invasion, "I never planned to go to Saudi 
Arabia," he said. "But I knew that if I stayed in Kuwait I was history and that 
if I left, at least I had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
His son is less philosophical about the escape. "It was fun," he said.

Page 5 of Sunday's Gulf Daily News carried a pleasant photo of Samira Mohammed 
Abbas and her children, along with their story: "It's cucumber with everything 
for the Abbas family, thanks to a freak batch of seeds which turned out 
melon-sized giants." 
</P>
<P>
Abbas was quoted extensively on the wonders of her garden but said not a word 
about the war clouds over the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly four weeks, the crisis and its effect on daily life remain Topic 
No. 1 in the streets, offices and restaurants of Manama and other gulf cities. 
Radio sales are up, shortwaves tuned to the British Broadcasting Corp. and the 
Voice of America. Everybody has -- or wants -- the latest news. 
</P>
<P>
But there is work to do and few signs of panic since the first days of Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas tends her vegetables and others pull their office shifts in a climate 
that shifts from tedium to tension to excitement, depending on the latest 
report. 
</P>
<P>
At Henry's Bar and the Rugby Club last week, expatriate singles were whooping 
it up as usual. In twos and threes, Gulf Air flight attendants, most of them 
Irish, pushed into the after-work throngs of British businessmen. Pakistani 
bartenders were pulling down draft beers five at a time long after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Talking war? No, talking shop, weekend plans, singles gossip. "That's him, the 
tall one in the blue pullover," one woman shouted over the rock beat of Henry's 
loudspeakers, nudging her friend. "He has a lovely black BMW." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at the Rugby Club, the party-goers gave at least a nod to the 
Kuwait confrontation. The managers were dealing out the last of their crisis 
T-shirts, the traditional souvenir for expatriates caught in an uncomfortable 
part of the world. A popular model featured oncoming Iraqi armor over the 
legend, "T'anks for the Memories." 
</P>
<P>
Two American Navy officers showed up loaded with Bahraini dinars. "We're asking 
for 200 (T-shirts)," one said. "But hey, if they had them, we could sell 
5,000." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to come up with new ideas all the time," said the T-shirt 
entrepreneur, a British stockbroker. "For those of us still here," he added, a 
dig tinged with disappointment with the expatriates who left the country after 
the Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The line at the Rugby Club Saturday night was that the expat community had 
shrunken around a core of Irishmen, who were too poor to afford passage home. 
"And some Brits, who are too dumb," a bystander added. 
</P>
<P>
But their numbers in Manama were made up by an influx of Kuwaitis, an estimated 
5,000, many returning from European vacations and getting as close to their 
occupied homeland as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In the big hotels, normally short of travelers at this time of year, the 
hottest month in the always-steamy gulf, Kuwaiti families are marking time. 
Their children, with no place to play, chase each other through the corridors 
and up and down the elevators, some in jeans and T-shirts, others, even the 
smallest, in long white gowns, dishdashas, and white headdresses. By evening, 
they are exhausted and the youngest burst easily into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti men, also in dishdashas, sit in the lobby reading the local newspapers, 
running worry beads through their fingers. In the evening, they move to the 
hotel bars and talk over a round of drinks, as far away as possible from the 
amplified pop of the Filipino lounge bands. 
</P>
<P>
The school year in Kuwait was to begin in mid-September, and refugee leaders 
say they are discussing possibilities with Bahraini authorities and private 
schools to provide classes here. If not, their children's education will become 
a casualty of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers, as anywhere, provide a running commentary on developments. After 
a minute of polite silence on embarking, the driver asks: "So what do you think 
will happen? Will there be war?" And then he proceeds to answer his own 
question, glancing over his shoulder as he barrels along the seashore highway. 
</P>
<P>
If the prospect of conflict does not provide enough apprehension, a ride in a 
gulf taxi will. The cabbie prudently straps himself in and lays a heavy foot on 
the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
One grizzled, gray-bearded old man, in dishdasha, made a 15-mile drive in about 
20 minutes, in traffic, a cigarette in his left hand, the wheel in his right 
hand, jerking through roundabouts and saying ugly things about Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In Dubai, where foreigners outnumber the watani unitals -- the local citizens 
-- by 3 to 1, many of the cabbies are Syrians or Pathans from Pakistan. "Never 
ride with a Pathan," said college-educated Syrian driver. "Their cabs are 
filthy and they are too." The Pathans speak only a bit of broken English but 
probably have a few thoughts about uppity Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
There's a crisis in the gulf, but life goes on.

U.S. REQUESTS PERMANENT SAUDI VISAS FOR WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has asked Saudi Arabia to begin issuing permanent exit and 
re-entry visas to American workers, a move that would speed up departures from 
the country in the event of increasing military hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials privately are playing down the current level of danger to 
Americans in Saudi Arabia and said it is unlikely that the State Department 
will recommend evacuation or strengthen travel restrictions even in regions 
closest to Saudi Arabia's border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a present danger to Americans living in the Eastern province," 
said one State Department official. "Right now we're at about the weakest 
possible travel advisory that's still a travel advisory." 
</P>
<P>
The policy on Americans living in Saudi Arabia reflects a growing mood of 
confidence here that there is little imminent danger of an Iraqi attack that 
would penetrate deep into Saudi Arabia. Despite the presence of more than 
100,000 Iraqi troops on the Kuwait border, U.S. officials have placed stronger 
restrictions on travel and employment in Jordan and Yemen than in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Their optimism, some sources said, reflects not only the presence of a massive 
American military deterrent force on Saudi soil but a belief that there is 
little chance that Iraq would succeed in delivering chemical weapons to 
population centers in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there has been restiveness among some of the estimated 12,000 
American workers and families in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province, the heart of 
the Saudi oil industry, that it may be difficult for them to leave in the event 
that the danger level increases. 
</P>
<P>
Under Saudi law, employers hold the passports of all their foreign workers, and 
applying for an exit visa on the passport normally takes anywhere from two 
weeks to a month. Some workers fear there could be delays in the event of a 
crisis should the Saudi government find it essential to retain foreign workers 
at vital oil installations. 
</P>
<P>
No American workers who have wished to leave so far have been denied either 
passports or exit visas, and Saudi officials have declared that any foreign 
worker who wishes to leave the country can do so at any time. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials in Riyadh have quietly opened discussions with the Saudi 
government about obtaining permanent exit and possibly re-entry visas for 
American workers and their families that would allow them to leave the country 
quickly if necessary. Re-entry visas would also help assure employees not under 
a fixed employment contract that they would not lose their jobs if they left 
the country temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire of the Americans to have their passport in their possession and an 
exit visa . . . conflicts with the desire of the Saudi employers to make sure 
they didn't leave," explained one U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
So far, thousands of Americans, most of them dependents, have left the Eastern 
province. About 5,500 of the 12,000 Americans normally living in the region 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials say that the Saudi government has cooperated in processing 
exit visas quickly for any American workers or dependents seeking to leave the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The government immigration office processed 900 exit visas in a single day 
shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait for dependents of employees at Saudi 
Aramco, the company that produces the vast majority of Saudi oil, and granted 
emergency exit visas for hundreds of Americans who congregated at the airport 
in Dhahran to catch a charter fight out at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Aramco, the largest foreign employer in the region, has told its 
employees they must forfeit their jobs and many benefits if they wish to leave 
the country. U.S. officials say they are willing to help Aramco employees who 
want to resign to obtain an exit visa quickly, but they warn them that they 
will not be able to return to work later under present regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"They were told the risk they were taking by having (the U.S. government) 
intervene is that they would get an exit-only visa, and it will be exit-only 
for a long, long time," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
A number of American workers have pressured the U.S. government to step up the 
level of its travel advisory in the Eastern province or even order an 
evacuation, a move that would allow workers on some contracts to leave the 
country at company expense and still retain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The government in early August advised dependents to consider leaving the 
Eastern province and recommended no travel to the region. On Aug. 15 the 
advisory was softened to recommend the deferral of "non-essential" travel to 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has determined from all information available that the 
threat to American citizens justifies this level of travel advisory," said a 
State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
Western sources said the United States is basing its recommendations on the 
belief that the U.S.-dominated multinational force will be able to deter or 
block any significant incursion into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also believe that a successful chemical weapons strike against 
population centers is unlikely. Iraqi Scud and Hussein missiles have sufficient 
range and are theoretically capable of delivering a chemical weapons warhead, 
but Iraq has never before discharged chemical weapons except by artillery, 
which is limited to a range of about 18 miles, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the liquid-fueled Scud takes about 18 hours to refuel, a process that 
would give plenty of warning time before an attack could be launched, according 
to some sources. 
</P>
<P>
"An aerial drop is possible, but in order to do that you have to fly low and 
slow, which turns you into a target in this area," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, U.S. officials have said they are willing to re-evaluate the 
travel advisory in the future but remain unconvinced that any additional 
restrictions are warranted now. 
</P>
<P>
"If war were to break out, the question in all of this is, 'Are Americans in 
danger" said one source. "It's not, 'Is there a war?' but 'Are Americans in 
danger?' I figure on a realistic basis, I'm in greater danger of being hit by a 
bus."

Der Spiegel said that confiscated business files from companies allegedly

Rebels fighting a five-nation West African peacekeeping force in Liberia have 
called for a summit of all 16 regional heads of state to end the civil war 
there, Togolese officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Woewiyu, spokesman for the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, urged Togo 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema to back the call for a meeting of the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), they said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, led by Charles Taylor, opposes foreign intervention in their 
8-month-old war to topple Liberian President Samuel K. Doe. They attacked 
soldiers from Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Guinea who landed in 
Monrovia, the capital, with orders to end the blood bath. Doe and breakaway 
rebel faction leader Prince Johnson have welcomed the ECOWAS peacekeepers.

Blustery storms whipped across Midwestern states Sunday, lashing southern 
Wisconsin with winds of up to 100 m.p.h., while high pressure dried out the 
storm-weary East Coast and heat baked the Great Plains. 
</P>
<P>
Showers and thunderstorms roved through the upper Midwest Sunday morning, 
dropping hail the size of golf balls near Minnewaukan, Minn., and inch-wide 
hail near Isabel, S.D., the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Wind gusts estimated at near 100 m.p.h. caused damage in La Crosse, Wis., while 
trees and power lines were blown down in the towns of Osseo and Arcadia. Gusts 
of about 60 m.p.h. hit Mobridge, S.D., and Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon showers and thunderstorms rolled over the Great Lakes states and into 
western Arkansas, western Montana and northern Idaho. Showers also reached from 
Florida across Georgia, the Carolinas and central Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Dense morning fog created hazardous travel conditions around the southeast 
Kentucky coal fields. Visibility dropped to near zero in many spots, especially 
valleys and low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
Skies were clear over the mid-Atlantic states Sunday as the weather system 
responsible for days of rain pressed out to sea. High pressure over the Ohio 
Valley gradually funneled drier air into the region. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service issued an air-stagnation advisory for southern West 
Virginia and extreme southwest Virginia through noon Monday. The advisory means 
the natural cleansing action of the atmosphere is poor as low-level winds 
weaken. 
</P>
<P>
Hot temperatures extended over portions of the Midwest. The overnight low 
temperature at Concordia, Kan., was 78 degrees -- the city's warmest low 
temperature for Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Heat advisories were posted Sunday over much of the central and southern 
plains, as well as a large portion of the lower and middle Mississippi Valley.

Anti-Communist protesters Sunday set fire to the headquarters of the governing 
Socialist Party, throwing torches through windows and scattering documents in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off roads into the capital and announced a national alert. 
</P>
<P>
President Zhelyu Zhelev said the country was in danger of "drifting . . . into 
a military dictatorship." He cut short his holiday in the Black Sea city of 
Varna to deliver a nationally broadcast radio appeal for law and order. 
</P>
<P>
Several firefighters and bystanders near the burned building were apparently 
injured by falling debris, a doctor on the scene said. One demonstrator said 
police were clubbing protesters inside. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd outside the building, which had swelled to as many as 10,000 people 
at one point, had shrunk to about 1,000 by early today.

Teacher Brian Keenan, released from captivity in Beirut on Friday, had told his 
captors he did not want to be released unless British journalist John McCarthy 
was freed also. 
</P>
<P>
"He said 'No,' he would not go without John McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
There was a big argument back and forth about it -- but he had no option," said 
Dr. Sean Blake, who examined Keenan on his arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Irishman received a tumultuous welcome in Dublin on Saturday 
night. Doctors said he was suffering from malnutrition but should bounce back 
to health soon. But Frank H. Reed, the American freed last April in Beirut, 
warned Keenan that the psychological wounds of such an ordeal may not heal 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Blake recounted what Keenan told him about his 52 months in captivity, mostly 
confined to a very small basement room: 
</P>
<P>
"He was chained up some of the time. He was very hot and there were mosquitoes. 
He was bitten all over," Blake told BBC Radio Ulster. He tasted no meat for 
four years, the physician added. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 33, of London-based Worldwide Television News, has been held more 
than four years. Keenan, on his release to Syrian authorities in Damascus, 
said: "I saw John McCarthy only two nights ago. He is well. John's great sense 
of humor was very much appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
Keenan also reported seeing two American hostages, Terry Anderson of the 
Associated Press and Thomas Sutherland, an academic. Keenan said that both men 
were well. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who flew by Concorde from the United States to greet Keenan in Dublin, 
warned of the psychological aftermath that Keenan might face.

TEACHERS AND DISTRICT ARE CLOSE TO SETTLING WAGE DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: SANTA PAULA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS IN THE 134-MEMBER UNION ARE 
EXPECTED TO VOTE THURSDAY TO RATIFY THE PROPOSAL ON PAY HIKES FOR THE PREVIOUS 
YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
The Santa Paula Elementary School District is on the verge of settling a nearly 
yearlong labor dispute with a union that represents 134 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Paula Federation of Teachers is expected to vote on the proposal 
Thursday. The offer is the last to be extended to the district before classes 
begin Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Carolyn Ishida declined to disclose details of the proposal but 
predicted union members will ratify it, noting that a three-member panel 
composed of union, district and state mediators has recommended acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that there is satisfaction on both sides," Ishida said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are attempting to settle annual wage hikes for the previous school 
year. The three-year contract with the teachers union expired June 30, and 
negotiations for a new contract have not begun. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers rejected the last offer containing a wage increase of 5.23% and 
demanded a 6% increase, retroactive to September, 1989. Costs of the salary 
increases will have to be taken out of this year's budget, an amount that is 
expected to be close to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
School officials also are confident that teachers will accept the district's 
offer, said Randall Chase, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
Chase declined to specify the offer, except to say it represents an increase in 
the last proposal to the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the old contract, teachers at the seven schools in Santa 
Paula earned between $20,120 and $39,936. They are also eligible to receive 
$975 in anniversary bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at the Santa Paula Elementary School District earn less than 
instructors in three of four other school districts in the city, according to 
figures compiled by the Ventura County superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the labor dispute, district officials have grappled with 
budgetary problems the past year. Declining enrollment in the past two years 
alone has translated into about $437,000 in lost revenue for the 3,100-student 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
The often bitter negotiations between teachers and the school district have 
continued since October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers several times threatened to strike because of the dispute, but never 
did. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the union asked for an 8.03% wage increase, retroactive to 
January, 1990, but was rejected after the school board said it could not afford 
to offer more without cutting staff. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the school board cited declining enrollment, dwindling reserves, 
school reconstruction expenses and the salary increases from the previous year 
as the major reasons for cuts in the district's 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The school board in July approved more than $515,000 in budget cuts, a decision 
that involved the layoff of nine teachers at one elementary school and the 
middle school. 
</P>
<P>
The move was timed with bonuses and salary increases for Chase and for district 
Superintendent David Philips and was protested loudly by the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said the budget may need to be revised further because of 
higher-than-anticipated costs in a reconstruction program at two elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
All students attending Isbell middle school and Barbara Webster elementary 
school will have to be housed in portable classrooms during the reconstruction 
project this year, and costs for those classrooms are exceeding estimates, 
Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida said she hopes the protracted labor dispute will not affect negotiations 
over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged and am looking forward to starting negotiations," she said.

1990-91 school year to pre-register. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can pre-register their children by appointment at each of the 
district's 19 elementary schools. Children eligible for kindergarten must be 5 
years old on or before Dec. 2, 1990. Parents should bring their child's birth 
certificate and proof of immunization to the school the youngster will be 
attending, she said.

YARD PATROL CHECKS DOGS FOR LICENSES

A man who appears to be lurking near houses and peering over fences in Oxnard 
neighborhoods may be a city animal control officer canvassing residential areas 
to enforce the dog license laws, Police Lt. George Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since Oxnard's dog license enforcement efforts began in 
1985, the department is devoting one full-time employee to the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The program was not publicized and people have been asking who is this 
individual going door-to-door and introducing himself as an animal control 
officer," said Moore, who manages animal control from the Police Department. 
"The concern is that . . . he's possibly casing the area for burglaries." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a uniform similar to that of the Oxnard police cadets, Animal 
Control Officer Joe Soto has been checking dog licenses since July 1. His 
mission is to update or issue licenses for all dogs older than four months. 
</P>
<P>
Licenses are $20 for unaltered dogs with proof of shots and $7.50 for altered 
dogs with proof of shots. Licenses can be purchased from Soto or at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Dog owners have 30 days after they have been contacted to purchase a license or 
they will be cited, Moore said.

All 120 employees will be offered the opportunity to move, says Univision's

DEVELOPERS' PARK FEES FAR BELOW LAND VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, developers in Orange County often preferred to comply 
with a county park law by paying fees instead of giving away land. 
</P>
<P>
And who could blame them. They were saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the decade, officials concede, the park-related fees charged by 
county government were based on outdated and below-market land values. 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1985, the park fees were based on the assumption that land was 
worth $28,000 an acre, county documents show. It was not until July 1, 1985, 
that county supervisors ordered that the park fees be phased upward, based on 
land values more closely resembling actual market levels. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as land prices continued booming toward $1 million an acre in many parts of 
South Orange County, developers until mid-1988 were allowed to pay fees based 
on values that were a mere $172,500 an acre and lower. 
</P>
<P>
The gaping disparity between the county's low fees and the actual cost of 
buying Orange County real estate for parkland was highlighted as far back as 
April 24, 1981, in an internal county memo. 
</P>
<P>
"The county's existing local park fee structure generates insufficient revenues 
to acquire and develop local park sites at today's costs," said the memo, from 
Environmental Management Agency executive R.F. Wingard. 
</P>
<P>
Another warning was sounded in a March 8, 1982, staff memo to the Board of 
Supervisors: "Because fees do not represent market value, the revenue generated 
is insufficient to provide local parks." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until July 1, 1985, that the supervisors took the first step 
toward overhauling the park fee structure. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we had difficulty getting this point recognized and dealt with fairly 
and squarely both in the county family and in the development industry," said 
Eric Jessen, the county Environmental Management Agency's chief of parkland 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
The valuations -- and the reduced revenues they generated -- are part of the 
reason why Orange County has significant shortages of neighborhood parks. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the fees are used by the county to buy acreage and to convert 
existing, undeveloped public lands into playgrounds or other recreational uses. 
If the fees don't keep pace with the actual cost of land, significant 
acquisitions and improvements become impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Park fees are most typically paid in developments of 50 dwelling units or less. 
But county officials also may allow developers of larger-scale communities to 
satisfy their park obligation through a combination of fees and land. The 
Orange County local-park law's basic standard is 2.5 acres of land for every 
1,000 new residents to be generated by a development. 
</P>
<P>
And the development industry likes the fees low. Representatives of the 
Building Industry Assn. have consistently opposed upgrades that exceed the 
overall rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of setting park fees based on up-to-date land values was 
explained by William Price, chief of appraisals for the county's real estate 
unit: 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to put parks into areas that are being developed," Price said in 
an interview. "And in order to do that, you have to pay the value of the land." 
</P>
<P>
Yet until July, 1988, the county's fees were either not updated annually or 
done so based on conservative, yearly increases in the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
Although CPI measures overall price changes of a spectrum of consumer goods and 
services -- such as food, entertainment, clothing and housing -- experts do not 
consider it the most accurate gauge of land values. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, during the booming development period from July 1, 1987, through 
June 30, 1988, Orange County increased its parkland fees by just 2.1%. In the 
then-booming areas of Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, that meant a 
per-acre-value rise to $176,500 an acre, up from $172,900. 
</P>
<P>
But the increase was "not at all" in keeping with land prices during the 
period, according to Byron R. Hoffman, owner of the Hoffman Co. land brokerage 
in Irvine. Orange County land values at that point, Hoffman said, "were going 
up very noticeably, in some cases dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the end of the decade that county supervisors began bumping the 
park fees up significantly. Acting just weeks after they had already approved 
the last of 18 major development agreements in areas of the South County, the 
supervisors on July 1, 1988, increased the land value base for park fees by 
42%, from $176,500 an acre to $250,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, on July 1, 1989, the supervisors raised the figure for most of 
Laguna Niguel to $750,000 an acre -- a 200% leap. But by then, most of the 
housing developments that can fit in the city were either completed or well 
under way.

THE CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF DOES NOT ABATE SOON.

While individual motorists are digging deeper into their pockets for a few 
extra dollars to meet rising fuel costs, Orange County governmental agencies 
and school districts are dipping deeper into their coffers for thousands of 
extra dollars to keep vital public services from literally running out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
With oil prices at a seven-year high, county government and school officials 
predicted that the cost of running buses, maintenance and sanitation trucks, 
police cars and other vehicles essential to county operations could soar from 
20% to 50% if the crisis in the Persian Gulf does not abate soon. 
</P>
<P>
Most school district and county officials stressed that the continuing increase 
in gasoline and diesel prices should not have an immediate effect on public 
services. But they added that in a worst-case scenario -- that is, if the 
crisis drags on or if war breaks out and disrupts the flow from Saudi oil 
fields -- Orange County residents may see cutbacks in transportation services 
or hikes in bus fares. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the last resorts would be to raise fares, and then the very, very last 
resort would be to reduce service," said Joanne Curran, a spokeswoman for the 
Orange County Transit District. "The last thing we want to do is cut service. 
We would increase fares before we did that, although that also is not a 
pleasant thought." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Persian Gulf situation is barely a month old, Curran said the 
county is already grappling with the fallout from the crisis. OCTD officials 
expect that, even if prices begin leveling off immediately, diesel fuel for its 
fleet of 481 buses will cost $900,000 more than originally projected for the 
current fiscal year. The state's new 5-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline will 
tack on another $300,000 to the county's annual fuel tab, Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD paid 52.3 cents per gallon for diesel fuel on Aug. 3 and 72.9 cents per 
gallon on Aug. 21. Curran said OCTD will try to offset the increased costs by 
delaying work on some new facilities and by cutting back on cosmetic 
improvements, such as a scheduled paint job for some of the fleet's older 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
The news isn't all bad for OCTD, however. Curran said that bus ridership has 
risen by about 30% in the last two years and that ridership will probably 
increase even more as motorists decrease use of personal vehicles to combat 
rising fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
While more riders may help balance out OCTD's ledgers, there is little that can 
be done to offset the increased cost of operating the county's 1,480 fleet 
vehicles -- including sheriff's patrol cars and vehicles for county inspectors 
and maintenance personnel -- and 109 trucks and buses, said Robert J. 
Stechmann, manager of the county's transportation division. 
</P>
<P>
The county has budgeted slightly more than $1.9 million to keep tanks filled at 
its six stations for county-owned vehicles, Stechmann said. More than 21,000 
gallons of fuel is dispensed from the county's Civic Center gas station alone 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors would have to approve any increase in the 
$1.9-million fuel budget if the crisis continues and gas supplies are 
endangered, Stechmann said. He added that in such an event, the board could 
order limitations on the use of some county vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get into a severe situation, public safety vehicles will receive 
priority, and (vehicles for) essential services so that the county can continue 
to transact business would follow," Stechmann said. Use of pool cars by county 
officials would probably be curtailed first, he said. 
</P>
<P>
School districts around the county have even fewer options than government 
agencies or OCTD since services, for the most part, are difficult to cut. "You 
have to bus the kids, and maintenance vehicles are really necessary to keep the 
district operating," said William Moncure, director of purchasing for the Santa 
Ana Unified School District.

<P>
ENDORSEMENTS: THE REVERSAL OF A STATE BAN IN CITY, COUNTY AND COURT ELECTIONS 
MAY PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO VOTERS, BUT SOME FEAR THAT IT PAVES THE WAY FOR 
PARTISAN DOMINATION. 
</P>

<P>
Political parties, suddenly free to endorse candidates in local elections, may 
soon begin to flex their muscles in city and county races and even in support 
of municipal and superior court candidates in Ventura County, area officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month struck down a state 
ban on endorsements in local nonpartisan races by the Republican, Democratic 
and other parties. 
</P>
<P>
An early test of the parties' willingness to endorse in nonpartisan races and 
of candidates' eagerness to solicit such endorsements is expected this fall in 
the crowded campaign for mayor in Oxnard, where two top contenders are from 
opposing parties. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the court ruling probably makes it inevitable that political 
parties will play a greater role in local elections, though some fear that 
would be a step toward the polarized ward politics of cities in some Eastern 
and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
Others predict a voter backlash if party endorsements become a major factor in 
nonpartisan local races. They worry that such stamps of approval could 
overshadow the qualifications of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Connell, chairwoman of the county Democratic Central Committee, said she 
understands such concerns, and her committee -- traditionally a quiet, 
behind-the-scenes group -- will be careful when choosing which candidate to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I think will be valuable to us," Connell said. "But I 
certainly think we will use the power in a judicious way. There's not any 
danger of bossism. We just don't function that way." 
</P>
<P>
If Connell promises caution, Gwen Tillemans, chairwoman of the Republican 
county committee, said she is not sure that her party will endorse any 
candidate in a nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, more than one Republican runs for a local seat, and endorsing just 
one could split the party, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in races where a single Republican is running against a Democrat, 
Tillemans said an endorsement is likely. "If it was a Republican judge running 
against a Democrat, then yes, we would," she said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, a Republican, was more enthusiastic about 
the court ruling, saying it opens the door for party mailers that endorse 
slates of candidates, even those for judicial positions. 
</P>
<P>
"With judges, the most important thing is that they be impartial," Schaefer 
said. "But a party endorsement gives a voter some kind of guide on whether a 
judge is liberal or not. If you vote for judges, you ought to know where 
they're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
The California Code of Judicial Conduct generally forbids judges from 
participating in partisan politics. But it does not specifically prohibit them 
from noting their party affiliation during a campaign or from accepting a party 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
In the six-candidate race for mayor in Oxnard, a top contender has already 
expressed an interest in formal party support. Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who 
is challenging Mayor Nao Takasugi, said that as "a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat, I 
would welcome the endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that these are supposedly nonpartisan positions, but when people 
act, their partisanship shows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi, however, was cool to a Republican endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to go out immediately and actively solicit this type of 
endorsement," he said. "It doesn't have anything to do with the decisions we 
make here. People may be swayed to vote on party lines only and not to look at 
the real issues and the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the stand of Takasugi, Maron said: "That must mean there are more 
Democrats than Republicans in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, in fact, is the only large city in Ventura County where a majority of 
registered voters are Democrats, according to the county registrar of voters. 
The other four cities with 50,000 residents or more -- Thousand Oaks, Simi 
Valley, Ventura and Camarillo -- all have more Republican voters than 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, which is considered politically conservative, has 20,000 more 
registered Republicans than Democrats, 142,513 to 122,685, though neither party 
has enlisted a majority of the 300,693 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Even without party endorsements, the political persuasion of countywide 
officeholders reflects that plurality. 
</P>
<P>
Six of seven non-judicial elective county posts -- district attorney, sheriff, 
tax collector, assessor, auditor-controller and superintendent of schools -- 
are held by Republicans. County Clerk Richard Dean is nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
Judges are also elected countywide. Their affiliations often reflect the party 
of whichever of California's three most-recent governors originally appointed 
them -- Republicans Ronald Reagan and George Deukmejian or Democrat Jerry 
Brown. On the Superior Court, where tenure is usually longer, Democrats still 
outnumber Republicans 9-to-6. But there are 11 Republicans on the municipal 
bench and just one Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin M. Osborne, presiding judge of the Superior Court, said he does not think 
that party endorsements will have much effect on the election of judges 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most judges are apolitical and very few of them are challenged in 
contested elections, so I don't know if it's terribly important," he said . 
</P>
<P>
"If a judge has to be beholden to a political party to be elected or reelected 
and has to satisfy the party bosses for support, I think that would have a 
tendency to erode the judiciary," he added. "But I don't see that happening in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Since reforms under Gov. Hiram W. Johnson nearly 80 years ago, California 
usually has avoided injecting formal party endorsements into local nonpartisan 
races on the belief that this decreases the opportunity for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some such endorsements, but in 1986, a state constitutional 
amendment barred the practice. A series of lawsuits led to the federal appeals 
court decision last week. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, a number of local officials and political analysts agreed that 
the ruling's impact will not be felt soon. But in the long term, Connell said 
it is possible that the Democratic Party may award endorsements even to 
candidates for local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
"They would still be nonpartisan races," she said. "It would simply be a matter 
of letting voters know how we feel about the candidates. I think they will just 
take party endorsements as one more piece of information about the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
But several elected officials said they were not interested in the parties' 
stamps of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Mayor Richard Francis, a Democrat, said that he does not plan to ask 
for his party's endorsement when he runs for reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a tradition of nonpartisanship in local races, and I think the 
public prefers it that way," Francis said. "I think it becomes a negative for 
anybody who breaks from that mold." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Monahan, who was mayor before Francis, agreed. "I'd rather see partisan 
politics kept out of city government," he said. "I just think there's too much 
pressure brought to bear. I'm assuming some decisions would be made on a 
partisan basis instead of on the basis of what is best for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Whether good or bad, veteran Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore said he does not 
think that party endorsements will make much difference to Conejo Valley 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"People in our city are pretty sophisticated and they tend to vote the issues. 
An endorsement might get someone a handful of votes but it's not going to make 
or break anyone. If you need a hole in the street fixed, it doesn't make any 
difference if you're a Republican or a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant John Davies, who has worked on Takasugi's last two 
campaigns and on Carolyn Leavens' challenge to Supervisor Susan K. Lacey in 
1988, said he thought that the court ruling will give more power to local party 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that party committees in most California counties, including 
Ventura, have little impact on elections. Members conduct voter registration 
drives and sometimes work phone banks but not much more. 
</P>
<P>
"This will give a little power back to the parties, but they don't provide a 
lot of assistance," Davies said. "There's only one political structure in 
Ventura County politics right now, and that's Patagonia." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia Inc., a Ventura-based outdoor clothing firm, contributed heavily to 
three successful campaigns by slow-growth candidates in the Ventura City 
Council election last fall and assisted 25-year-old newcomer Maria VanderKolk 
in her stunning upset of Schaefer in the June supervisorial election. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sweeney, a veteran of national political campaigns and now a Patagonia 
strategist, said the appeals court decision is very significant. 
</P>
<P>
"In a local race, it's sometimes hard for people to sort through the 
candidates," Sweeney said. "But if they have an outside entity quickly narrow 
the field with party endorsements, suddenly you can have two front-runners." 
</P>
<P>
Though acknowledging that Patagonia has acted as such an influence itself, 
Sweeney said he is not sure that party endorsements are a good thing in local 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if it might take some of the substance out of local politics by 
focusing on endorsements rather than trying to define what the real issues 
are," he said. "There's something special about local politics that is 
different from any other kind, and I almost don't like to see it get co-opted." 
</P>
<P>
In races such as last fall's in Ventura, where council seats went to the top 
four finishers in a 16-candidate field, a party endorsement could be decisive, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get that stamp of approval from an entity like the Democratic or 
Republican parties," Sweeney said, "that's worth an awful lot of votes."

PARKING TICKETS GO UNPAID BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO ENFORCE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although nine cities in Ventura County are owed a total of more than $800,000 
in unpaid parking tickets, none of the cities have aggressive programs to track 
down repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard has the highest number of tickets outstanding, amounting to $340,554. 
That would be more than enough to restore four police positions that were cut 
from the city's budget in June. 
</P>
<P>
But officials there and in other cities say many of the unpaid tickets were 
issued to out-of-state residents and other hard-to-find people. They say it's 
not practical or cost-effective to hunt them down. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-hundred-thousand dollars is a sizable amount," said Oxnard Assistant 
City Manager John Tooker. "The question is, how much of that is truly not going 
to come back?" 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. George Pultz of the Oxnard Police Department agreed that the city can't 
afford to go after parking scofflaws routinely. "We don't have people to search 
for a vehicle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Don Arth, in charge of the Ventura Police Department's traffic division, 
said Ventura's problems with people who park illegally are not serious enough 
to warrant hunting them down. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the sheer numbers of people who are doing that," Arth said. 
"We might be spending more than we're getting back." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the city is planning to increase some parking fines to $25 
from the current $7 to $12. 
</P>
<P>
If the increase is approved by the county's Municipal Court Judges Bail 
Committee, it may become worthwhile for the city to track down offenders, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, cities in Ventura County are not as tough on parking offenders as 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No local cities use the wheel-locking device known as the Denver Boot, which 
Los Angeles applies in cases where five or more tickets are outstanding. Cities 
in Ventura County also rarely impound cars, another Los Angeles practice. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the cities in Ventura County have as serious a problem with parking 
offenders as Los Angeles, which, as of April 15, 1990, had close to $249 
million in unpaid parking tickets on the books. 
</P>
<P>
The nine Ventura County cities that keep records issued more than 68,000 
tickets in 1989. A total of 33,853 tickets, some of them dating from previous 
years, have not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard and Ojai contract with other agencies, based in Los Angeles and 
Torrance, to process parking tickets -- which can include keeping track of 
whether tickets are paid, mailing delinquent notices and sending information on 
unpaid violations to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Moorpark uses Thousand 
Oaks to process its tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities in the county process the tickets themselves. Fillmore tabulates 
the information by hand. Santa Paula keeps no records of outstanding citations, 
said Brenda Monser, city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the California 
Highway Patrol said they write very few parking tickets in unincorporated areas 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Many Ventura County cities allow a parking offender between two weeks and a 
month to pay a ticket before mailing a notice and adding a late fee, which is 
usually $10 to $20, depending on the city and the type of ticket. 
</P>
<P>
If the vehicle owner still fails to pay the ticket, a notice is sent to the 
DMV. The state agency puts a lien against the car. In order to re-register the 
car, the offender must pay the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
But those measures aren't always sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Oxnard's outstanding tickets were issued to cars for which the DMV 
lists no registered owner, said Marjorie George, accounting manager of finance. 
Some of the cars were owned by people in other states. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, a violator sells the car without notifying the DMV of the new 
owner, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Everette Garmon, revenue manager for Ventura, said people develop cavalier 
attitudes toward tickets when they are renting cars, using company cars or 
driving cars not registered in California. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is an especially bad time for the county's coastal cities, which are 
inundated with parking offenses when out-of-state vacationers arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone's from out of state and they don't want to pay it, there's no way 
we're going to collect," said Jim Hanks, finance director in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The top offender in the county has 65 outstanding tickets, worth $1,005 to the 
city of Ventura, Garmon said. The next-highest violator has 28 unpaid tickets 
and owes $476 to Ventura, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities occasionally go after particularly brazen offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police, who keep a list of habitual parking offenders, made sure to 
impound one car that had accrued $800 in unpaid tickets, Pultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Police went to the address where the man was usually ticketed, found the car 
and impounded it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme officials were irritated by a man who continued to park his 
motorcycle in a red zone near the Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion 
Center, Hanks said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers staked out the area after issuing the man's third ticket and warned 
him against parking there again. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth ticket brought more than a warning. It marked one of the rare 
occasions when the city impounded a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a special case," Hanks said. "It became a game." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Hanks said, the city relies on the DMV to force a person to pay rather 
than meting out punishment to scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, we try to keep low-key," Hanks said. "We prefer everyone obey the 
law and not have to do these kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
Other scofflaws have made getting tickets a habit. They collect their tickets 
and come in about every three months to pay off the fines, said Garmon of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have people who come in and plunk down $300 to $400 in tickets," he 
said. "We're aghast but that's what they do." 
</P>
<P>

WICKETS, GOOGLIES, BATSMEN AND TEA -- THAT'S CRICKET 
</P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are the boys in white flannel suits, and every week at Modjeska Park they 
enjoy a game of intense concentration, infinite subtlety, arcane rules and 
peculiar nomenclature, and a little tea. 
</P>
<P>
It is cricket played on American soil by a host of expatriates from England and 
a dozen other countries, who want to keep the sun from setting on a cherished 
pastime of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
On Modjeska's manicured cricket ground, the 11-man sides of the Anaheim Cricket 
Club steadfastly play the 600-year-old game, which many unappreciative 
Americans look upon as the inferior root of a higher form of sport called 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
To the cricketer, the crack of willow on red leather and the honing of skills 
needed to hit pitches that bounce at odd angles off the turf at 80 m.p.h. are 
preferable to beer and a box seat behind home plate at the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a game that can never be mastered. That is the challenge," said Grant 
Salisbury, 27, a player from New Zealand. "But what I really like is batting -- 
to have someone chase after the balls you hit for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim club, which fields two teams, is part of the Southern California 
Cricket Assn., which coordinates a total of 22 clubs and 27 teams. The season, 
with 18 league games, playoffs and a championship match, runs from Easter to 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The team is a virtual melting pot. Most of the players are immigrants from 
England and countries that were once part of the British Empire -- India, 
Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand, 
Australia and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
And for these immigrants, cricket is more than a day at the park. It's a bit of 
home away from home, where expatriates can maintain a cultural tradition as 
well as find a network of new friends with a common heritage. 
</P>
<P>
After a match, Anaheim's cricketers often retire to the British and Dominion 
Club in Garden Grove, where over pitchers of ale and in a variety of British 
accents, they dissect the day's match. Before too long, their nationalistic 
prejudices surface when they inevitably begin to rate the world's seven major 
cricketing nations. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left (Trinidad), I thought that was the end of cricket for me," said 
Kamaluddin Rajab, a native of Trinidad and an ardent supporter of the West 
Indies cricket team. "I never imagined I would find other Trinidadians and so 
many cricketers here." 
</P>
<P>
At Ahaheim's home ground at Modjeska, the pop of willow bats can often be heard 
over the noise of softball games, picnics or the crunch of shoulder pads 
belonging to Pop Warner football players. 
</P>
<P>
But what English writer Godfrey Smith called "the noble summer game" rarely 
draws an audience in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a contest of skill," said Roy Herbert, 54, captain of Anaheim's first 
team. "You don't appreciate that until you have played the game. If you just 
watch, you can't grasp the technicalities, the strategy. It looks like nothing 
is happening. But we know what the batsman is going through just to stay up." 
</P>
<P>
Cricket resembles baseball, but it is more intricate and players say there are 
more varieties of play. There are 10 ways to be put out or "dismissed." Batsmen 
can hit the ball anywhere on the field, even behind them or to the side. And, 
once the ball is hit, they don't have to run if they think there is a good 
chance they will be put out. 
</P>
<P>
The game also has an admittedly curious lexicon that has not been revised for 
centuries. Bowlers pitch googlies. Fielders are called a variety of odd names, 
including gully, cover point, extra short, slip, and silly -- silly, team 
members say, because a barehanded fielder must be silly to want to play a few 
yards from the batsman. 
</P>
<P>
The field or ground is a carefully manicured oval of grass about 180 yard 
across. In the center of the field is the pitch, a marked-off area of play 
which has two wickets 22 yards apart. 
</P>
<P>
Each wicket has three stumps about 28 inches high, which loosely cradle two 
crosspieces called bails. Four feet in front of each wicket is a chalk line 
called the crease, the English version of the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
During play, the side that is up places a batsman at each wicket. They take 
turns hitting after six pitches, a period known as an over. The team out in the 
field has a bowler or pitcher, a wicketkeeper with a glove, and nine barehanded 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Like its American counterpart, cricket is a bat-and-ball game, and the winner 
is the team that scores the most runs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly technical, and as far as hitting, the more you hit with style the 
better you are considered," said Roger Levy, 47, the captain of Anaheim's 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
The batsman tries to defend the wicket by stopping the thrown ball or hitting 
it with his bat. If he drives the ball into the field, both batsman can run to 
the opposite wicket, which scores a run. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlers can put out batsmen by bouncing the ball past them and dislodging the 
bails from the wicket. Batsmen can also fly out to fielders or be thrown out if 
they do not reach the opposite wicket in time after a hit. Both sides get 10 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
The average match lasts seven hours, not counting tea breaks and lunch. 
Arguments with the umpire aren't allowed and neither are fights between teams. 
The benches never clear for a donnybrook in the pitch because the proper 
decorum is maintained by the prospect of lengthy suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Arguing? That isn't cricket," said Aijaz Ali, a player from Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Ali, 21, who started playing street cricket with a tennis ball, is Anaheim's 
leading batsman, averaging 66 runs a game. In one match alone, he scored 96 
runs. He was at bat an hour and 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hit the ball hard," Ali said, "and show some good shots, you will 
know how this game feels -- good." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Ali and the Anaheim Cricket Club went on the road for a match at 
Woodley Park in Los Angeles, Southern California's equivalent of Marylebone 
Cricket Club in England, the cradle of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
After four hours of play on the park's verdant ground, the score: Anaheim 40; 
Cosmos 41. It was a rout. But only in the odd world of cricket can a loss by 
one run be considered a poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's bats were almost silent Saturday as they faced Terrence Mills, a top 
bowler from Trinidad. The club tallied only 40 runs -- "a paltry sum" a player 
said -- before their side was retired by the required 10 outs. Ali was held to 
only 1 point. A more acceptable team score would have been around 200. 
</P>
<P>
That left Cosmos with the relatively easy task of scoring 41 runs before its 
batsmen were dismissed. They attained the winning run after only four outs. Tra 
la, Anaheim. Good show, Cosmos.

<P>
When Kathy Lovell decided to surprise her husband last year with an early 
Christmas present, a pot-bellied pig named Truffles, she more than succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was shocked. He didn't speak to me for two weeks," Lovell said. 
"Now, he loves it. He tucks it into bed every night. It's his pig." 
</P>
<P>
Before she brought Truffles home, she had gotten the consent of her neighbors, 
including those to the back of her property. But other owners of farm animals 
in Costa Mesa aren't always as thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officer Robert O'Brien said he answers calls about goats, 
roosters and pigs, usually from neighbors irritated about animal noises in the 
city that used to be known as Goat Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Roosters make their wake-up calls as early as 3 or 4 a.m., and goats about to 
be slaughtered often put up a loud fuss, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually when we get a call about a goat, it's been dismembered and it's in the 
pot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That may change if the City Council approves an ordinance formalizing and 
amending the current policy on farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
It has been almost two years since the council voted to allow certain farm 
animals to be kept at homes with a permit. That vote came after residents 
Arthur and Angela Raj Kumar were ordered to get rid of their pygmy goat, 
Barney. The Kumars marched the animal into the council auditorium and persuaded 
council members to change the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office has since reviewed existing laws and drafted an 
ordinance that spells out other requirements, such as adequate space for the 
animals and proper care and feeding. The council asked the city staff to 
include a provision making it illegal to slaughter animals in residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Since the council vote to change the city's policy regarding animals such as 
Truffles and Barney, O'Brien has been categorizing them as exotic. If he gets a 
complaint about an animal, he urges owners to either get rid of it or apply for 
a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," he said. "It's really just a pink slip on your pet" that 
will help animal control officers identify and return it if it ever escapes. 
</P>
<P>
There are permits in the city for raccoons, snakes, monkeys, pygmy goats and 
pot-bellied pigs. Residents, however, may not have more than four exotic 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the city of Orange is considering a "designer-animal ordinance" that 
would allow exotic pets. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien admits that his office usually finds out about violations only when 
neighbors call to complain. Many animals are still kept illegally, many times 
to the detriment of the animals, he said.

"Livestock, let's face it, they belong on the farm," he said. "It's not natural 
for the animal to be kept in the back yard. They need grazing space." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lovells disagree, at least in Truffle's case. They have installed a 
swinging door in the back door leading to the yard, giving the pig full run of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell thinks her pet is better than a dog because it doesn't bark, but she 
admits that Truffles isn't as affectionate. 
</P>

"She just hangs around and eats, and you know she's there," she said. MARY ANNE

CITY EXPECTED TO OK CAR-POOL, BIKE PLAN

<P>
An program to encourage city employees to car-pool or bicycle to work is 
expected to be approved by the City Council tonight. The incentives include 
preferential parking for car-poolers; bicycle racks, showers and locker rooms 
for employees who bicycle to work; and a guaranteed-ride program for emergency 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are also considering a quarterly newsletter, a ride-sharing 
fair, an orientation session with new employees and marketing materials 
designed to encourage ride sharing and alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the program is estimated at just under $58,000, according to 
Traffic Engineer Richard Edmonston. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations come in response to pressure from the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, which is pushing local governments to reduce their 
employee's transportation needs. According to Edmonston, AQMD staff members 
have not assured the city that the proposed program of incentives is sufficient 
to meet their requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The city may be forced to consider other alternatives, including time off, 
"significant" cash incentives, compressed workweeks and pay parking. LAURA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET CRISIS LOOMS, CITY OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seal Beach may be sliding toward a financial crisis as it begins to feel the 
impact of state budget cuts, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is heading for bankruptcy," Councilman Joe Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said he believes that in three years Seal Beach will find itself in the 
red with no reserve funds to absorb the deficit. That would force layoffs and 
painful cuts in services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Robert Nelson estimates that Seal Beach will cross into the red in 
four years if costs continue to grow faster than revenues. The effects of 
recent state budget cuts and other unforeseen expenses could push the city into 
deficit much sooner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
State cutbacks have left Orange County with an estimated shortfall of $46 
million. To make up for the loss, the county is considering levying a number of 
new fees on cities for services it now provides for free. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed new fees is a $75.50 booking charge for each prisoner that 
city police departments bring to Orange County Jail. County supervisors have 
indicated that they will approve the fee, which would cost Seal Beach more than 
$22,000 per year, Capt. Gary Maiten said. 
</P>
<P>
The county also may start charging cities for collecting property taxes, which 
would cost Seal Beach about $37,000 per year, said finance director Denis 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he expects that the city's legal bills will also grow as it 
prepares to fight a possible lawsuit by the Mola Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
If Seal Beach rejects a claim filed recently by the company, Mola attorneys 
say, the company will sue for more than $11 million to recover costs it spent 
in an unsuccessful bid to build a $200-million housing project that the city 
first approved, then rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach's 1990-91 budget is only $16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis could pinch finances even further as higher gasoline 
prices increase the costs of keeping police and other city vehicles on the 
road, Nelson said. CHRISTOPHER ADAMS

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; 
</P>
<P>
REUNION BENEFICIAL FOR EX-TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It seems all Bret Boone and Jim Campanis needed was to get back together. 
</P>
<P>
Boone and Campanis, former teammates at USC, were reunited midway through this 
season on the Seattle Mariners' Class-A team in Hampton, Va., the Peninsula 
Pilots, and, apparently, the reunion has re-energized both players. 
</P>
<P>
Since Boone joined the Pilots after the Mariners drafted him in the fifth round 
of the draft in June, Campanis has raised his average from below .200 to .260. 
After starting slowly, Boone's average is .278. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good professional relationship in that we can help each other," 
Campanis said. "He'll say something to me about something and I'll say 
something to him. . . . It's a good situation. I hope I'm on his team next year 
or he's on mine, however it works out." 
</P>
<P>
For a week earlier this month, the pair was virtually unstoppable, matching 
numbers worthy of the Carolina League's offensive player of the week. Boone, a 
second baseman, batted over .500 for the week of Aug. 13-19, going four for 
four with two home runs in a game at Salem, Va. 
</P>
<P>
But those statistics paled when compared with the week of Campanis, who catches 
and was named the player of the week. In seven games, he had nine hits, seven 
of which were home runs, and 15 runs batted in. And on Aug. 12, the day before 
that week, Campanis also hit a home run, giving him eight in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Campanis said he hasn't had such a streak since the NCAA regionals in 1988, the 
year Boone followed him in the USC lineup. At the regionals in Fresno, Campanis 
hit two home runs in three consecutive games but the Trojans lost two games on 
the final day and Fresno State advanced to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Campanis, in his final season at USC, batted .392 with 23 home runs 
and 93 RBIs, and Boone, in his first season as a Trojan, hit .326 with eight 
home runs with 53 RBIs. Campanis was drafted by the Mariners in the third round 
after that season and since the separation, neither player has hit as well. 
</P>
<P>
In two more seasons at USC, Boone never hit better than he did as a freshman. 
Campanis hit .255 with 11 homers last year at Class-A San Bernardino in his 
first season of professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In June of this season, Campanis was hitting .171 for the Pilots, but within a 
week of Boone's arrival, Campanis said, he was hitting better. 
</P>
<P>
They have helped each other by remembering the things that made them successful 
during their time together at USC. They also called another former USC 
teammate, Dave Latter, a pitcher with the Athletics' team in Madison, Wis., for 
advice that Campanis said was helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship goes beyond their USC connection. Campanis said he has known 
Boone since Campanis was 14. Boone, the son of Royals catcher Bob Boone, went 
to El Dorado High School; Campanis, whose father, Jim Sr., played catcher in 
the majors for six years and whose grandfather, Al, was the Dodgers' general 
manager, went to Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Up a notch: Dave Staton, a Tustin High School graduate and former Orange Coast 
and Cal State Fullerton player, is continuing to live up to his billing as one 
of the Padres' top minor league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Staton, who won the Northwest League triple crown last season with a .362 
average, 17 home runs and 72 runs batted in while playing for Spokane, batted 
.287 with 19 homers and 62 RBIs for Riverside in the California League this 
season before being promoted to double-A Wichita in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
For Wichita, Staton, now moved from third base to his natural position, first 
base, is batting .336 with 5 home runs and 25 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetable start: In his major league debut Tuesday against the Royals, Twins 
pitcher Paul Abbott allowed six hits, five walks and seven earned runs in 
three-plus innings and the Royals prevailed, 8-7. After the game, Twin 
outfielder Dan Gladden told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he is frustrated 
by the decision of Minnesota Twins management to promote Abbott, who had a 5-14 
record with triple-A Portland, when other minor league pitchers have better 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably stepping out of bounds by saying this, but it's frustrating. I 
was a guy who had to earn everything I got, knock on doors to get a job. I 
roomed with guys who had 10-10 records in triple A and never even got called up 
for a cup of coffee. And then you see this," Gladden said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, 22, was recalled Aug. 18 from Portland to make two starts in place of 
Kevin Tapani, who is on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Gladden said former University of Minnesota pitcher Denny Neagle, who has a 
combined record of 19-3 at Class-A Visalia and double-A Orlando, would have 
been a more logical choice to replace Tapani. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to see a guy with 19 wins down in double A and see him not 
get called up," Gladden said. "It's not fair to the rest of the guys on the 
team to have to take the field with somebody pitching who may not belong here. 
If we go out on the field with a guy we knew had won 19 games, it would be 
different."

ANN CONWAY: WEDDING EXPERT MAKES BELLS RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's been written up in People and admired on the cover of Town &amp; Country 
magazine. She's been romanced by Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark, and David 
Niven's son, David Jr. 
</P>
<P>
She's the daughter of Texas oil magnate Benjamin Johnson Fortson Jr. and his 
wife, Kay Kimbell Carter, a couple at the zenith of Lone Star society. 
</P>
<P>
But Karen Fortson, the beautiful Ft. Worth heiress, has left it all behind to 
follow the love of her life to Orange County. And it will be here next month 
that she will marry sound recording specialist Tom Davis in a private ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Who's the wedding coordinator? Susan Nunn, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Now. Don't go pumping Nunn for details about the Fortson-Davis nuptials. She'll 
just smile her sweet, enigmatic smile. She's fiercely protective of her brides. 
</P>
<P>
But go ahead and ask her anything about weddings -- from "how much cake?" to 
"what kind of music?" -- and she'll answer gladly and thoroughly. Nunn's love 
of wedding celebrations and her commitment to making them flawless has made her 
queen of the Ritz-Carlton gazebo, the place to be married in Orange County. The 
facts: Nunn averages one gazebo wedding per week and the hotel has a one-year 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
What's the attraction? "The view of the ocean, the getaway feeling, the 
romance," said Nunn, who coordinated four gazebo weddings last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ritz is the only Five Star hotel in Orange County," she added. "It's 
black-tie at the beach. It's prestige." 
</P>
<P>
A typical gazebo wedding has the bride and groom standing just outside the 
Mediterranean-style structure during the ceremony, Nunn says. After all, guests 
don't want to lose sight of the blushing bride as they sit -- as they sometimes 
do -- on chairs fitted with satin coverlets. After the wedding, there is 
usually an elegant dinner in one of the Ritz ballrooms and, more often than 
not, the newlyweds settle into one of the Dana Point hotel's luxury suites for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
The cost? "Oh, weddings range from $20,000 to $200,000," said Nunn, whose 
offices are in Orange. "Anything lower than $20,000 and you're not going to get 
much of a wedding these days." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn likes to extend her services beyond what she promises on her brochure: 
attendance and organization of the rehearsal, wedding and reception. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she likes to help the couple with their honeymoon suite. During 
the wedding reception, Nunn will steal away to the couple's accommodations and 
make sure the room is filled with champagne, flowers, warm food, wedding cake, 
and no booby traps. Recently, a best man filled a marital bed at the 
Ritz-Carlton with cornflakes and pizza. Nunn and her crew whisked it away. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff and I check the room very carefully," Nunn said. "We know what to 
look for: booby-trapped beds, missing bathing suit tops, and buttons removed 
from clothing." 
</P>
<P>
To get through a wedding day, Nunn and her staff use two-way radios. They came 
in handy before a recent wedding at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach 
when the fire alarm went off. 
</P>
<P>
"Announcements were coming over the speakers that the hotel was being 
evacuated," Nunn said. "I messaged one of my assistants to get the bride into 
the hotel garden so she wouldn't panic. The wedding guests were able to remain 
seated and the bride didn't hear a thing. But she'll find out all about it when 
she watches her wedding video." 
</P>
<P>
Sick brides and grooms are another challenge for Nunn. "Recently, a groom 
passed out three times during his wedding ceremony," Nunn said. "And I had a 
bride get very sick before a ceremony. They get on these liquid diets so they 
will look thin and beautiful on their wedding day. Unnecessary." (Nunn notes 
that she has never had a bride or groom pass out at the Ritz-Carlton gazebo.) 
</P>
<P>
Nunn is confident that the Fortson-Davis nuptials, which will be attended by 
locals and a slew of Texans (some of them friends of President Bush), will 
unfold without a hitch. Karen's beautiful mum is a perfectionist. Consider: Kay 
Fortson has also retained a wedding coordinator from Texas. Recently, that 
coordinator flew to Orange County via private jet to check out wedding cakes 
and sample food. 
</P>
<P>
And Kay Fortson is concerned about detail right down to the rehearsal-dinner 
plates. She has asked Nunn to send her a sample plate so that she may inspect 
"the blue," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the social highlights of the Fortson-Davis celebration will be the 
rehearsal dinner for 180 people given by Kay Fortson's dear friend, Anne 
Marion, wife of Sotheby's auctioneer John Marion (he's the genius who hammered 
down $53.9 million for Van Gogh's "Irises"). It will be quiet and elegant, with 
a pre-dinner reception taking place in the Ritz-Carlton's only seaside party 
room with a wood-burning fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
But with all of the planned grandeur, Karen Fortson -- who is deeply religious 
-- cares most about one thing, Nunn says. "She wants her marriage to be 
blessed, to know God is smiling on her and Tom."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On stage, Juan Gabriel -- striking pop star poses in his white satin suit -- 
provoked shrieks of delight from Saturday night's crowd at Santa Ana Stadium. 
Backstage, promoter Carlos Quintanilla smiled and weighed the show's success. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout, he admitted, was a little lower than he had hoped for -- about 
3,000 shy of the venue's capacity of 11,000. But it was enough to encourage his 
designs on making the football stadium a regular home for large-scale concerts 
aimed at the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Stadium is primarily a sports facility, serving as the home football 
field for Cal State Fullerton, Rancho Santiago College and several high 
schools. Few concerts have been held there, and those that have were less than 
successful. Another Gabriel concert about 4 years ago (organized by a different 
promoter) suffered security problems, as fans jumped from the bleachers and 
overran reserved seats on the grass. A heavy-metal show featuring Poison 
provoked noise complaints from nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
But police at Saturday's show reported no noise complaints and said there had 
been few enforcement problems. "We showed it can be done," said Quintanilla, 
president of Arcos Management Services in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based company has promoted shows by Gabriel throughout the United 
States. It opened an office in Mission Viejo 2 years ago and moved it to Santa 
Ana last month. Quintanilla believes that Santa Ana Stadium, located near a 
large Latino population, is an ideal venue for big Hispanic acts, such as Jose 
Jose, Emmanuel and Miami Sound Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, a Mexican singing star with a large U.S. following -- enough to 
warrant three shows at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles in November -- 
became the first test of his theory. "This is our first big show. . . . He is 
one of the most prolific record sellers in the Hispanic market," Quintanilla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice stadium. We're looking to bring in quality acts," said Amado 
Quintanilla, vice president of Arcos and Carlos' cousin. "As far as what the 
market will bear, we will see." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Quintanilla said he was encouraged enough by Saturday's results to 
proceed with plans for a 3-day music festival next June at Santa Ana Stadium, 
modeled after an annual event in Chicago that draws about 50,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The audience at Saturday's show was obviously enraptured with Gabriel, sending 
out cheers that could be heard easily across the street, where small groups of 
fans without tickets listened to the show. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Alex Gonzales of Brea said he had seen Gabriel in his last visit to 
Santa Ana Stadium, where he encountered "a lot pushing and shoving. . . . I was 
not going to come because of last time." 
</P>
<P>
But he decided to attend with his wife, and they celebrated their wedding 
anniversary with Gabriel and opening acts Los Huracanes del Norte and Angeles 
Ochoa. This time, he said, he had no problems with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Arcos Management is promoting concerts by Gabriel Saturday in Chicago and Oct. 
6 in El Paso. It is also organizing a benefit Oct. 17 at the Shrine Auditorium 
in Los Angeles to benefit a Latino AIDS awareness project. 
</P>
<P>
The concert ties in with another project by the Santa Ana Arcos office, set to 
be launched Sept. 1 -- a series of public service announcements on AIDS 
awareness given in Spanish by such stars as Madonna, Los Lobos, singer Martika 
and actress Maria Conchita Alonso. The spots, produced in conjunction with Los 
Angeles County, will air on Spanish-language TV and radio stations.

The battle among aerospace firms to build the Air Force's advanced tactical 
fighter became an air war today as a Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team got its 
version off the ground first. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine YF-23 took off from Edwards Air Force Base at 7:16 a.m. and 
joined two chase planes on a flight that lasted about 50 minutes. 
</P>

Test pilot Paul Metz, 44, took the jet to 25,000 feet and 333 m.p.h., but 
didn't push its capabilities.

The ATF will cost about $51 million per plane, almost twice as much as the F-15

A helicopter carrying Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, three 
members of rock legend Eric Clapton's entourage and a pilot slammed into a hill 
in dense fog early today, killing all aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan, 35, had just finished a performance with Clapton at Alpine Valley 
Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
A National Transportation Safety Board investigator said the five-seat Bell 206 
Jet Ranger helicopter flew into the side of a 1,000-foot ski hill. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Alpine Valley said there was dense fog after the show. 
</P>
<P>
Clapton's Los Angeles press agent, Ronnie Lippin, said the other victims were 
Bobby Brooks, Clapton's booking agent; Nigel Browne, Clapton's bodyguard, and 
Colin Smythe, one of Clapton's tour managers. The name of the pilot was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Comer, a spokesman for Vaughan in New York, said he was told that 
Vaughan had taken a seat on the helicopter at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"Stevie and his brother, Jimmie, and Jimmie's wife, Connie, were there" 
backstage after the concert, Comer said. "Peter Jackson, Eric Clapton's 
manager, came in and said there might be some spare seats. He came back later 
and said, 'I'm really sorry, but there's only one seat.' Stevie said, 'Do you 
mind if I take the seat? I really need to get back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan, whose style combined the best of Jimi Hendrix and the old blues 
masters, normally was not part of the Clapton tour but was added to the Alpine 
Valley show Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan had a platinum album with his band, Double Trouble, in "Couldn't Stand 
the Weather," released in 1984. In 1985, he shared a Grammy Award for best 
traditional blues recording with several other artists for a compilation album 
called "Blues Explosion." 
</P>
<P>
This year, he won a Grammy in the contemporary blues category for "In Step." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan was born Oct. 3, 1954, in Dallas. He followed his brother, Jimmie, also 
a well-known musician in the band the Fabulous Thunderbirds, from Dallas to 
Austin in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Going from club to club and band to band, Stevie Ray Vaughan developed a 
rocking Texas roadhouse blues style. In 1981, he formed the band Double 
Trouble. The band caught the attention of record producer John Hammond, who 
helped Vaughan find a record label. 
</P>
<P>
Guitar Player Magazine cited Vaughan as the best electric blues player in 1983, 
1984, 1985, 1986 and 1988, finally naming him to its "Gallery of the Greats" in 
1989.

HYDRANT GUSHER IN N. HOLLYWOOD WASHES 10 FAMILIES OUT OF UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten North Hollywood families were homeless this morning after a jet of water 
from a broken fire hydrant flooded their apartment building and damaged their 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the apartments in the 24-unit building at in the 11700 block of 
Vanowen Street were damaged after a car sheered off the fire hydrant near the 
curb in front of the units Sunday afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-foot-high arc of water shot onto the roof and into the center courtyard of 
the two-story apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a hurricane," said Wanda Sanchez, manager of the complex. "There 
was a waterfall coming down off the roof." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said a Department of Water and Power crew turned off the water in about 
15 minutes, but not before water leaked through the roof and several apartment 
ceilings. Water, gas and electricity were turned off in about 12 units, and 
residents were evacuated to an American Red Cross shelter at nearby Madison 
Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Red Cross workers toured the apartments to determine whether they 
are habitable. Nancy Albrecht, a disaster volunteer, said the Red Cross will 
continue to provide shelter at the school or in motels for families displaced 
by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said at least seven apartments are badly damaged. In many of the 
apartments ceilings were crumbling, water pooled on the floors and beds and 
furniture were drenched. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Freudenburg, a DWP spokesman, said a broken fire hydrant can spew up to 
5,000 gallons of water per minute. He said it was unusual for a hydrant break 
to result in water shooting into a nearby property. The hydrants are design to 
break off completely so the water shoots straight up and then falls down on the 
curb area, he said.

SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS NOT LIKELY: STUDY

A predicted teacher shortage probably will not materialize because many 
veterans who left the profession are returning, a study said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Education Information said that 38% of current public 
school teachers have had at least one break from teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the new teachers hired since 1985 have had at least one break, 
and 18% of these have had two or more breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching appears to be a revolving door," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no question" that statistics projecting teacher shortages 
are not accurate, said Emily Feistritzer, director of the center, an 
independent, nonpartisan research group. She said little attention has been 
paid to the "returning teacher phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
"All this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is not being borne 
out in data anywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The study analyzed the results of a 58-question survey of 3,201 current 
elementary and secondary school teachers -- 2,380 public school teachers, 469 
teachers who had participated in alternative teacher certification programs in 
Texas and New Jersey and 352 private school teachers.

Two citizens groups today asked the Bucks County coroner to reopen an 
investigation into the death of political activist Abbie Hoffman for signs that 
he was driven to suicide by a controversial anti-depressant. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman had taken the drug Prozac six weeks before he was found dead on April 
12, 1989, in his Solebury Township apartment, the Citizens Commission on Human 
Rights and the Prozac Survivors Support Group said in a letter to the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner Thomas Rosko's autopsy showed Hoffman, a founder of the 1960s anti-war 
Yippie movement, died from an overdose of the sedative phenobarbitol and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter, the groups cite a Harvard study linking Prozac to obsessive 
suicidal thoughts. Published in the February edition of the American Journal of 
Psychiatry, the study found that 3 1/2% of Prozac users developed suicidal 
thoughts that lasted up to three months after taking the drug.

3 WOMEN FOUND SLAIN IN TWO APARTMENTS NEAR FLA. CAMPUS

A young college student was found slain in her apartment early today, hours 
after police found two other young women dead in another apartment near the 
University of Florida, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not immediately link the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments are less than two miles apart on the south side of Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring that possibility, but right now we just don't know," said 
police Lt. Sadie Darnell. 
</P>
<P>
The three slayings on the eve of the fall term prompted parents to flood the 
university community with worried calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We're receiving calls from all over, particularly from out-of-state parents," 
said Darnell. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said the university also was getting many calls. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies went to the lone woman's apartment in nearby Alachua County after she 
failed to report to work at midnight, said sheriff's spokesman Spencer Mann. He 
said she was 18 and a student at nearby Santa Fe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said there was trauma to the body, but he would not say how she died. 
</P>
<P>
University officials did not immediately confirm a published report that the 
two other victims were incoming UF freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the two other women were found Sunday when the parents of one had 
police and a maintenance man open the apartment door. The parents had been 
unable to contact their daughter all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The two women were nude and suffered violent deaths sometime during the 
weekend, according to Darnell. She said police had no suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
She said the bodies suffered multiple traumas, but there were no obvious signs 
of gunshot wounds although police weren't ruling out the possibility. The 
victims' identities were not released.

For once the news was good: 2 million imported cigarettes had been unloaded 
over the weekend in the nicotine-starved Soviet capital. 
</P>
<P>
Muscovites rushed out this morning to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
But many kiosks sold out by afternoon, leaving desperate smokers who have 
already lived through a monthlong shortage even angrier. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, this is the fifth time I have stood in a cigarette line, and I have 
nothing to show for it," said one distraught woman after a kiosk closed. 
</P>
<P>
One man was lucky -- he reached the open kiosk window and because he was on 
crutches, he was allowed to buy seven packs instead of the normal limit of 
five. But he was hardly in a better mood. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past three or four days I have been smoking cigarette stubs I 
collected on the street," said Vyacheslav Borisov.

EX-GUINNESS CHIEF GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY;

<P>
COURTS: A LONDON JURY CONVICTS ERNEST SAUNDERS OF A STOCK SCHEME LINKED TO THE 
1986 TAKEOVER OF A SCOTTISH DISTILLER.

<P>
Former Guinness PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Ernest Saunders and three 
co-defendants were found guilty today on 19 of 20 counts of misconduct in 
connection with the 1986 takeover of a Scottish distiller. 
</P>
<P>
The jury at Southwark Crown Court, which deliberated for nearly a week, 
convicted Saunders, 54, on two charges of conspiracy to contravene the 
Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, eight charges of false accounting and 
two charges of theft. He was acquitted of illegally destroying documents. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Ronson, 50, chairman of Heron International PLC, was found guilty of 
conspiracy, two charges of false accounting and one of theft. 
</P>
<P>
Former stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44, was found guilty of four charges of 
false accounting and two of theft. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted millionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, on two charges of 
conspiracy, three charges of false accounting and one of theft. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were convicted on 19 of the 20 counts listed on the charge 
sheet. Some charges named more than one defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Denis Henry said Saunders, Ronson and Parnes would be sentenced Tuesday, 
and postponed sentencing until Sept. 25 for Lyons, who is to undergo surgery 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men still face trial for their alleged involvement in a scheme to 
arrange for the purchase of Guinness' stock during the takeover fight for 
Distillers Co., a Scotch whiskey and gin maker, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The government said there was an illegal operation to support Guinness' share 
price to make its cash and stock bid of 2.7 billion pounds, or $5.18 billion, 
for Distillers more attractive than a rival bid from supermarket operator 
Argyll Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 million pounds, or $76.86 million, of Guinness shares were 
purchased during the Distillers takeover fight. The prosecution claimed 
Guinness paid about 25 million pounds, or $48 million, in unlawful indemnities 
against losses in share dealing and in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Guinness succeeded in April, 1986, in what was then Britain's largest takeover. 
In December of that year, the Department of Trade and Industry announced it was 
investigating; Saunders was arrested in May, 1987. Other arrests followed. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, who has maintained he is a scapegoat, smiled as the jury foreman read 
the verdicts. Afterward, as he was led away, he waved to son James and daughter 
Joanna in the court's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with Sky Television, Saunders accused the prosecution 
of building "a politically based, mega-case . . . which has been hyped to an 
extraordinary extent." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that for their own reasons a number of people have found it 
convenient to blame Ernest Saunders for a number of things that have gone on," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Guinness Director Jonathan Guinness said today that he felt sorry for 
Saunders and his family but added, "I don't see how the jury could have come to 
any other verdict." 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, Judge Henry asked the jury to decide whether the 
criminal law "needs to protect markets to try to keep them straight, or should 
we simply leave it to the fat cats and the law of the jungle?" 
</P>
<P>
The market is not a casino with the game fixed in favor of a few rich and 
privileged players, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case was brought to trial by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, set up two 
years ago to investigate and prosecute complex fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
In the second trial, expected to start in October, Saunders will again be a 
defendant, along with Roger Seelig, 44, former corporate finance director for 
Morgan Grenfell and Co. Ltd.; Lord Patrick Spens, 47, former director of 
corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry Ansbacher and corporate finance 
partner of the investment firm Cazenove and Co. Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48, 
senior corporate finance partner at Cazenove.

CNC Holding Corp. has signed a definitive agreement to sell its 82% stake in 
Child World Inc., a toy retailer, to Trefoil Capital Investors LP, a limited 
partnership, both parties said today. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Trefoil said it would be a "non-cash transaction" in 
which Trefoil would give Cleveland-based CNC a debenture. 
</P>
<P>
Trefoil also said it had agreed to buy the 18% of Child World stock that is 
publicly held for $14 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Trefoil is a $450-million fund formed by executives of Shamrock Holdings Inc., 
based in Burbank, Calif., who waged a long takeover attempt for Polaroid Corp. 
that ended in early 1989 when Polaroid paid the raiders $20 million to end it.

OIL PRICES IN DECLINE AS MIDEAST TENSIONS EASE;

GULF CRISIS: WHOLESALE COSTS OF UNLEADED GASOLINE AND OTHER REFINED PETROLEUM 
PRODUCTS ALSO PLUMMET.

Lessening tension in the Middle East pushed down oil prices by more than $4 per 
barrel today in a selloff that professional traders called the biggest one-day 
decline in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of wholesale unleaded gasoline and other refined petroleum products also 
plummeted in response to a sense that the threat of war has receded in the 
world's most abundant oil region. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easing of the tensions," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst 
with Shearson Lehman Bros. "A change in psychology, too." 
</P>
<P>
The energy market was influenced by a number of weekend developments, notably 
the U.N. Security Council's sanction of force against Iraq and other diplomatic 
activity that suggested the Iraqis are feeling acute isolation after their 
seizure of Kuwait Aug. 2 and are willing to talk. An OPEC meeting in Vienna 
also led traders to bid down the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis and Venezuelans and United Arab Emirates are all expected to 
increase production," said Peter Beutel, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy 
Futures. "That could alleviate supply problems." 
</P>
<P>
Envoys from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting in 
Vienna to discuss the shortfall of 4 million barrels a day caused by the 
international boycott of oil from Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In midafternoon trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's 
largest market for petroleum, the October-delivery price of light sweet crude 
dropped $4.66 to $26.25 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Crude had been trading above $30 a barrel since reaching that plateau Wednesday 
for the first time since November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline plummeted 18.66 cents to 86 cents a gallon on September 
contracts, following last week's rally that kept prices well above $1 a gallon. 
Home heating oil dropped 12.96 cents to 78 cents a gallon for September 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The Merc doesn't keep records of petroleum price ranges, but exchange aides 
said the one day drop in crude was the biggest they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
October contracts for natural gas fell to $1.502 per 1,000 cubic feet from 
$1.525 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hittle said today's downturn was accentuated by a British banking holiday, 
which prompted traders in London to make oil deals elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Despite today's sharp drop in oil prices, those following the industry 
cautioned that crude can move back up as easily as it moves down, depending on 
whatever news comes from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
On the European spot market, where crude is bought and sold to the highest 
bidder, the United Arab Emirates' Dubai light -- the key OPEC crude from the 
Middle East shipped mainly to the Far East -- was down $1.15 at midday to 
$28.45 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's widely traded North Sea Brent fell 60 cents to $30.40 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Gulf Coast spot market, prompt delivery WTI was off $1.30 a barrel 
to $26.55 a barrel.

Monica Seles kept her eye on the ball today, much to the detriment of Elena 
Pampoulova. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has a different feel about it," Seles said of the canyon-esque 
Louis Armstrong Stadium at the National Tennis Center. "Each Grand Slam is 
unique. You look up and it's so high that you can't see the end of it, and you 
think to yourself, 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
She wowed Pampoulova, taking only 44 minutes to crush the Bulgarian 6-0, 6-0 
and move into the second round of the year's fourth and final Grand Slam 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a better court than any other Grand Slam tournament," Seles said of 
the concrete-and-steel edifice. "You see the ball better here." 
</P>
<P>
Pampoulova's eyesight apparently wasn't as good. She won only 23 points in the 
match, six in the second set. Seles won 54. 
</P>
<P>
Other early opening day winners were Dinky van Rensburg of South Africa, 
Natalia Medvedeva of the Soviet Union, Sandra Cecchini of Italy and Julie 
Halard of France. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg defeated Eva Sviglerova of Czechoslovakia 6-3, 6-1; Medvedeva beat 
Terry Phelps 6-4, 6-2; Cecchini defeated Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia 
6-3; 6-1, and Halard beat Brenda Schultz of The Netherlands 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eleventh-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia escaped a first-round threat 
from England's Jo Durie, winning 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
In men's singles, sixth-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria advanced when Aki 
Rahunen of Finland retired while trailing 5-7, 6-4, 6-0, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Other men to post first-round victories included Fabrice Santoro of France, 
6-2, 6-4, 6-4 over Ivan Baron of Plantation, Fla., and South Africa's Gary 
Muller, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 over Roberto Azar of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Seles is one of the favorites, along with defending champion Steffi Graf and 
Martina Navratilova, to win the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she was eliminated in straight sets by crowd favorite Chris Evert in 
the quarterfinals. It was the final match victory in Evert's 19-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Two longtime crowd favorites will be missing this year. Evert retired after 
last year's tournament, while Jimmy Connors, a five-time U.S. Open champion, 
withdrew Sunday because of a strained left calf suffered Saturday in a match 
against Ivan Lendl.

Ak-Sar-Ben ended its 85-day meet Sunday with a 27% decline in attendance from 
the previous year and a 32% drop in mutuel handle. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't take another year like this," said Executive Director Don Drew 
said. "If we are down this much next year, it would effectively kill racing in 
Omaha, Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
The overall attendance this season, which includes simulcasting outlets, was 
601,517. That was 27.1% lower than the 1989 total of 825,371. On-track 
attendance of 444,236 was 32.4% lower than last year's total of 657,167.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS;

<P>
LUKE WAITS FOR FAVORITES' LOSING STREAK TO END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Somerset's Turn, running second from the beginning of the seven-furlong race 
against 4-year-olds and up, charged into the stretch a head behind Muscle 
Bound, a horse that was tiring after attempting to go wire-to-wire. Somerset's 
Turn steadily wore down Muscle Bound through the stretch until he showed in 
front and took a head lead midway down the straightaway. At the wire, 
Somerset's Turn was pulling away, well in front, by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool Hand" Luke let out his breath and sighed with relief. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was only the third race of the sixth (May 2, 1990) day of racing at 
Hollywood Park, Luke was worried because up until that point he had been losing 
on a system he had been developing for those gamblers who visited the track 
every day and who were there for every race. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Luke a profit of $409.60 and put him in a position from which to 
regain all the money he had lost up to that point in the brief season and even 
to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Luke, after making a study of the Racing Form, going back a few years through 
Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar race tracks, found that if he waited 
for the favorite to lose four consecutive races, then he could start a 
money-progression system beginning with the fifth race until the favorite wins. 
</P>
<P>
And after cashing in on a race, Luke again waits for the favorite to lose four 
more consecutive times before beginning over with a $2 bet. If the favorite 
continues to win, say two or three or more races in a row, then Luke keeps 
waiting. And if the four straight losses continue over from one day to the 
next, or if the bets continue over from one day to the next, then Luke follows 
his system as if there never was a nine-race card or a break in racing from day 
to day. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a money progression isn't cheap by any means, Luke admits, and it 
takes faith in the system as the favorites lose and the bets get higher. 
Undeterred by the high bets called for as the losses mount, Luke wagers as 
follows: $2 -- 2 -- 4 -- 8 -- 16 -- 32 -- 64 -- 128 -- 256 -- 512 -- 1,024. 
</P>
<P>
He says that one must even be willing to continue such a series to $2,048 -- 
$4,096 and higher to gain a win if the favorites continue to lose, because 
eventually the favorite is going to come in first, inasmuch as it wins year in 
and year out at race tracks 28% to 33% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
At Hollywood Park during the past season, Luke never wagered more than $1,024 
on a race, because, in its worse losing streak, the favorite finally won after 
going through 14 consecutive losses, the first four of which were passed over, 
according to "Cool Hand." 
</P>
<P>
Luke is fortunate that he can go to the track every day to watch the races, 
make his bets and enjoy such a system, since most people, unless they are 
retired, don't get the opportunity to catch every race day after day. An 
electrician, carpenter and sort of a handyman who can build and fix anything, 
Luke can schedule his own work hours, leaving him free for his race track 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
And since his name is Luke, his cronies started calling him "Cool Hand Luke" 
after the movie came out with actor Paul Newman in the leading role. Of course, 
Cool Hand, say his friends, also can refer to his ability with wood and cement 
and wires and metal. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, when Luke won $409.60 on the third race on May 2, it was after he 
had lost six races, totaling $64, on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing his series, on May 2, which was the next racing day, he bet $64 on 
the first race and $128 on the second. Then he bet $256 on Somerset's Turn, 
which paid $5.20. The win returned Luke $665.60. After deducting the $256 bet, 
Luke won $409.60 on the race. However, after making other bets for the day that 
totaled $196, Luke ended up with a profit of $213.60. 
</P>
<P>
Another winning session for Luke at Hollywood Park began May 17. Luke passed 
the fifth through the eighth races as the favorites lost and then started his 
money progression on the ninth with a $2 wager. The horse lost, but Luke ended 
up with $2.60 in winnings for the day because he had won the fourth race, the 
favorite paying $6.60. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the betting progression on May 18, Luke lost on the following 
favorites: First race, Flor'em Jak (-$2); second, Picture Princess (-$4); 
third, Yugo Marie (-$8); fourth, Dr. Mar More (-$16); fifth, Mittens and Mink 
(-$32), and sixth, Crystals of Ice (-$64). 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Luke plunked down $128 to win on Dakotah Thunder, which was the 
$2.80 to $1 favorite. Running a mile against six other 4-year-olds and up, 
Dakotah Thunder came out of the No. 5 post position, settled into third, 
dropped back to fourth at the half-mile pole and then made his move. 
</P>
<P>
At the three-quarter mark Dakotah Thunder moved into second and took aim at the 
leader, Joe Nasr, who was in front by a head. Dakotah Thunder caught Joe Nasr 
in the middle of the stretch and pulled away to win by two lengths. The nag 
paid $7.60, giving Luke a return of $486.40 and a profit on the race of 
$358.40. 
</P>
<P>
Luke didn't make another bet that day as the favorites won the eighth and ninth 
races. However, for the day, after deducting the $126 bet on the first six 
races, Luke left the track with $232.40 in winnings for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Not all is sweetness and light, even as Luke wins. Some of his cronies are 
disbelievers, scoffing at his system and calling him naive. They argue that the 
system is fine providing the favorite comes up a winner when $512 is bet. 
However, going beyond that, only four more losses would call for a wager of 
$16,224. And who has that much loot? Even if one has, betting such a huge sum 
to win on a horse certainly would change the odds, cutting down on the mutuel. 
</P>
<P>
Luke brushes off such criticism like taking swats at flies. He points out to 
those of little faith that on 14 of the 67 Hollywood Park racing days, there 
were no bets to be made. However, during the 53 he did wager, his returns from 
winnings amounted to $2,316.40 and his losses equaled $483.60 -- for a profit 
of $2,316.40, which is nothing to sneeze at. Winning days occurred 77.3% of the 
time, with 41 showing gains and only 12 losing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his detractors, Luke manages to keep smiling all the way to the bank. 
After all, he tells himself, he is a $2,316.40 winner for the season, while 
most bettors are losers.

ILLINOIS TRACK ROBBERY A PUZZLE

<P>
Officials at Maywood Park Race Track say they still don't know how masked 
gunmen found a hidden accounting room at the track, let alone how they robbed 
it and got away. 
</P>
<P>
"We're puzzled," Bill Moore, the track's assistant general manager, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is safe to say they had some information because they were able to get in 
too smoothly. The source of the information is what puzzles us." 
</P>
<P>
The masked duo took at least $20,000 in cash Saturday from the accounting room, 
despite secrecy about its location. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared they knew where it was. They circumvented a maze of stairs and 
doors," said Police Capt. Arthur Jackson. "Employees there for two years often 
don't know where accounting is." 
</P>
<P>
The robbery also was timed between betting periods, when few people are around 
the grandstands, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Before making off with the cash, the gunmen disarmed a security guard and 
disabled three employees with tear gas spray, police said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the victims required hospitalization, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first robbery since the track opened in 1946, track President 
Patrick Flavin said.

The grandson of Josef Stalin will portray the late dictator in a new Soviet 
film about World War II, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported today. 
</P>
<P>
It said Yevgeny Djugashvili, a professor at a military academy, has agreed to 
take the part in "War Is War for Everyone" after long refusing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The film covers the life of Stalin's son Yakov -- Djugashvili's father -- who 
was captured by the Nazis and offered in exchange for high-ranking German 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin, whose real name was Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili, refused the 
offer, saying: "We do not exchange generals for soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Yakov is assumed to have died in a German prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
The new film will star Zaza Kolelishvili, a well-known Georgian actor, as 
Yakov.

BRIDGES PLAYS 'THE HEAVY' IN NEW FILM

<TEXT>
<P>
Try not to gasp when you see Jeff Bridges starring in "Texasville." 
</P>
<P>
It's shocking to see how the slender, muscular leading man of "Starman" and 
"Tucker" has let himself get fat, sloppy and slack-jawed in the span of a year 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
There he is on the big screen, weighing well over 200 pounds, his gut hanging 
over his belt, his double chin in need of a shave. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Bridges has hit the skids personally. He's simply doing justice 
to Duane Jackson, a role he first essayed 20 years ago in "The Last Picture 
Show." It's Duane who's gone to seed. Not Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
The last time we saw Duane back in 1970 he was an 18-year-old Texas high school 
football flash. Now he is middle-aged, out of shape and $12 million in debt. 
Bridges has done a splendid job of bringing author Larry McMurtry's character 
to life again, abetted by outstanding direction from Peter Bogdanovich. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Bridges was enjoying pasta at lunch in Westwood, his weight 
about 175. Once more he looked like the actor who starred with his brother, 
Beau, two years ago in "The Fabulous Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The transformation from Jeff to Duane was carefully calculated. Bridges didn't 
use body padding or makeup to create the older Duane. The poundage produced the 
actor's concept of the good old Texas boy. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually approach a role by figuring out what the guy I'm playing looks like 
physically," Bridges said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I try to mold my body along those lines. Duane, after all, was 10 years 
older than I am. I needed weight for the age factor and for the shape he would 
be in after the kind of food he must have been eating. I put on 35 pounds, 
getting my weight up to about 210.

"The weight was uncomfortable. I didn't feel well, which is enough reason to 
keep my weight down. But it was worth it because it helped me believe in 
Duane."

-- Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid and Cloris Leachman -- was a 
powerful inducement that drew Bridges back to the sequel.

"I wanted this picture to measure up to the first one," he said.

The Peggy Sue immortalized in song by rock 'n' roll pioneer Buddy Holly 
returned to Texas to judge a Buddy Holly look-alike contest. 
</P>
<P>
But Peggy Sue Rackham of Sacramento could not make up her mind Saturday. She 
chose co-winners, Sherrell Wilson and Richard Edwards, both of Slaton. 
</P>
<P>
Slaton is about 15 miles from her hometown of Lubbock, where Holly also grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Peggy Sue," a hit by Holly and his group, the Crickets, initially was called 
"Cindy Lou," after Holly's niece, but the name was changed during a recording 
session in 1957, Rackham said. 
</P>
<P>
Rackham married the Crickets' drummer, Jerry Allison, in 1958. They shared a 
honeymoon in Mexico with Holly and his bride, Maria Elena.

Linda Ronstadt blames arena concerts and radio programmers for the "awful" 
state of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"What really ruined pop music is the architecture that it's presented in," 
Ronstadt told the Pittsburgh Press. 
</P>
<P>
"Any place that's bigger than 11,000 is just not a suitable environment for 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the sound in such places as "swimmy and boomy," she said, "I hate 
playing in them, and I will never be in an audience at one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Of the current music scene, the singer-songwriter said, "It's awful." One 
reason: "the corporate approach to radio programming." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a musician and you come from Memphis or Nashville or New Orleans, 
areas that have some of the richest musical heritage in the country, you have 
to go to Los Angeles in order to do it," Ronstadt said.
