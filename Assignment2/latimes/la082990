PROPOSAL TO CUT PAYROLL TAX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is always a source of amazement how Will can be brilliant in dissecting the 
issues and solutions on the political horizon and yet be so confused as to why 
various people and groups take the positions they do. 
</P>
<P>
In supporting Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes, Will correctly 
points out how unfair it is to use these Social Security surpluses to finance 
the government's general operations, and more importantly, how regressive the 
tax is -- a flat tax with a ceiling on taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
But Will wonders why Republicans don't jump on the bandwagon and support 
Moynihan's plan. From the days of Alexander Hamilton to George Bush, 
intelligent conservatives have understood what politics is all about -- place 
the benefits of government on the wealthy and big business and the costs on the 
middle class and poor. Will questions whether it is wise for conservatives to 
campaign for a cut in the capital gains tax, an increase in taxes for beer and 
yet oppose paring Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, politically it may be a blunder, but ideologically it is right on the 
money. One only hopes that other liberals see the light that Moynihan has seen: 
The soul of the Democratic Party is indeed at stake.

WESTERN AID FOR SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the CIA misreading the Soviet economy ("CIA Misread Soviet Economy," Part 
A, Aug. 3) since 1950 or misleading the American government? 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the leaders of the CIA would rather be seen as well-meaning bunglers 
than as disinformers, especially in view of recent events in Eastern Europe; 
yet I wonder if the agency wasn't really being artful in its overestimation of 
Soviet economic achievements during the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Cold War program, in which the CIA was deeply involved from the very 
beginning, was certainly served better by this alleged misreading than it would 
have been by accurate information.

WESTERN AID FOR SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Hunger Pangs in Soviet Future" (Aug. 1) emphasizes an important 
point. However, there are several considerations not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
If the West does not offer the Soviet Union help, it may not only be the end of 
President Mikhail Gorbachev but also the end of Communism in Russia itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the consequences of withholding help would be: 
</P>
<P>
1. The end of the Soviets' $3 billion per year assistance to Castro. 
</P>
<P>
2. The billions of dollars of Soviet military aid to the Afghan government 
since the Russian withdrawal would have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
3. Their billions to aid client states, like Vietnam, Ethiopia, Angola and 
North Korea and to support domestic and worldwide KGB activities, would have to 
be greatly curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
4. The 25% of the Russian annual budget (Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's 
figures) for military expenditures would have to be drastically cut. The 
British defense secretary, Tom King, said last month that the Russian 
production of new submarines was one every six weeks, while every day two 
aircraft, six tanks and one missile were being made. 
</P>
<P>
It is appalling to think of what would happen to the efforts for world peace if 
the things above were to come to pass. Before withholding credits or actual 
monetary aid, we must carefully consider the actions our Russian friends would 
be forced to take.

SHAKEN OUT OF PROFOUND HYPNOSIS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: ARAB NATIONALISTS RALLY AROUND HUSSEIN NOT BECAUSE OF HIS 
INVASION, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S DONE TO THE STATUS QUO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MOHAMMAD TARBUSH, Mohammad Tarbush, a Geneva-based investment banker and 
writer on current affairs, is the author of The Role of the Military in Iraq 
(Kegan Paul International, 1982). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In classical antiquity, the Stoic doctrine advocated that if a completely new 
beginning is to be made, nothing of the old must remain. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, one does not have to be a Stoicist, nor even a political 
philosopher, to see today that the status quo now prevailing in the Middle East 
cannot be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 200 million Arabs dispersed in 22 heterogenous states. A 
high percentage of them still live below subsistence level, while a few 
thousand have wealth that neither they nor their descendants could ever live 
long enough to spend. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 52 million Egyptians, 25 million Moroccans, and 21 million 
Sudanese, for instance, are basket cases. Meanwhile, only 1% of the Arab people 
are nationals of the oil-producing Persian Gulf countries whose aggregate gross 
national product amounts to 25% of that owned by the rest of the Arab world. 
When Saudi Arabia is added to the gulf countries, the figures become 5% and 55% 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Such a lopsided situation inevitably leads to instability -- Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait is but a dramatic example. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as the European Economic Community help to eliminate such 
discrepancies in the West. But for the Arab people, such cooperative measures, 
when attempted, have been whimsical, rarely systematic and invariably modest. A 
striking example is the $300 million annually pledged by Arab leaders at their 
1988 Algiers summit to support the Palestinians (with a $700 per capita yearly 
income) living in the Israeli occupired territories. This represents a mere 
one-fifth of 1% of Kuwait's estimated assets. 
</P>
<P>
Economic and financial imbalances have added strains to a political environment 
already saturated with other ingredients for instability and frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
A million and a half Palestinians still live under military occupation with the 
daily risk of having their arms broken if raised against their occupiers. 
Another 3 million are dispersed all over the globe. Half of Lebanon's 
population has joined the Palestinians in their rovings, while the other half 
strives to survive under the most precarious of conditions. Syrians, once the 
pioneers of Arab culture and political thought, live under the permanent fear 
of meeting the fate of their brethren at Homs and Hama. This inglorious list 
could go on and on. But this sickening litany is enough to make the obvious 
point that the present state of affairs in the Arab world is hardly worth 
spilling any human blood to protect. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is not to say that it was right for Saddam Hussein to invade a 
peaceful neighbor. Indeed he must unconditionally allow all those Kuwaitis who 
fled their country in panic to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
It is tragic that Kuwait has fallen victim of a regional and generalized 
malaise, which if left untreated will spread to other parts of the Arab world 
and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever many Arabs might feel about Kuwait, most will admit that Hussein has 
shaken the area out of its profound state of hypnosis. That act alone is likely 
to lead to a rallying of Arab nationalists behind Hussein, not because they 
approve the invasion of one country by another, nor because they approve of his 
repressive policies at home, but because they disapprove the status quo that 
his move against Kuwait has endangered. 
</P>
<P>
It was these frustrations I had in mind when, in 1982, I wrote in Le Monde on 
the Arab leaders' apathy and inaction toward Israel's invasion of Lebanon: 
</P>
<P>
"Among the Arab masses, the classical situation of a role looking for a hero 
does now exist. This hero will be born out of the stifling frustrations being 
felt by those masses. He will be urged to throw over the wall all the 
conventions which his people are being asked to respect, and which the Israelis 
are being tolerated for violating. He will be expected to sentence the oil 
wells to fire, and in the smoke of the aftermath to work on inciting popular 
uprisings against those regimes desperately lacking in legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the feeling of disconcertion, already intense, was exacerbated by 
Arab incapacity to resolve the Lebanese crisis or to bring an end to Israel's 
occupation of Arab land or its brutal treatment of Palestinians under 
occupation. With no real means to oppose their oligarchic regimes, Arab 
nationalists stood helpless in societies infested with corruption, squandering 
of national wealth, mismanagement and ruthless "thought police" forces, too 
efficient in suppressing all manifestations of patriotism or any calls for 
basic liberties. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background, American support in maintaining the status quo in the 
Arab world will be seen as siding with the past against the future, as 
supporting anachronism and standing against the course of history. The present 
crisis might teach the Americans, like Suez should have taught Britain and 
France, that the world order is changing and bygone ideas are the property of 
bygone generations. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's success in mobilizing so much international support against 
Iraq clearly shows that the United States has the means and the clout to solve 
any crisis through diplomacy. How wonderful it would be for the Arab people in 
particular, and humanity in general, if the United States, the world's leading 
democracy, would inject the sick body of Arab politics with some of its 
homemade, tested and cherished medicines: democracy and heavy, very heavy, 
doses of egalitarianism.

<P>
NO. 1 BUT OVERSTRETCHED?; 
</P>
<P>
WE'RE SO BEDAZZLED BY THIS DISPLAY OF OUR MILITARY PROWESS THAT WE'RE BLIND TO 
ITS EFFECT ON OUR SAGGING ECONOMY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the varied responses to the Kuwait crisis that are observable these days 
in the American media and among strategic analysts, one of the more prominent 
has been a sense of satisfaction at the country's rapid projection of military 
force halfway across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
After all of the worrying talk about the decline of the United States, it was 
clear once again that only America had the capacity to dispatch large military 
forces to Saudi Arabia, to deter further Iraqi aggressions and to preserve 
international order. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the German and Japanese, touted as the new economic superpowers, 
had failed the basic test; the European Community once again displayed the 
weaknesses of not being a unitary state; a weakened Soviet Union played a 
marginal role. 
</P>
<P>
America was still No. 1, the actor who dominated the world's stage. Far from 
displaying imperial overstretch, it had robustly demonstrated its 
quasi-imperial power. And the only worry left was whether its own public 
opinion had the will to support a conflict that might be both lengthy and 
bloody. 
</P>
<P>
Such feelings of satisfaction at the display of American power may, of course, 
dissipate if the conflict does become costly or stalemated. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all of this focus on U.S. military capabilities, or on national willpower, 
may be obscuring rather than illuminating the larger question of the real U.S. 
position in world affairs. That obscurity stems in large part from the media's 
excitement at the demonstration of American military muscle, which causes us to 
forget the critically important, nonmilitary dimensions of national power. If 
we allow this to be so, we will be repeating the national blindness of many 
earlier great powers engaged in large military operations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, Spain's decision in 1634 to send a powerful army into 
Germany to join its beleaguered Austrian Hapsburg cousins during the Thirty 
Years War. Its infantry and generals were first-rate, its deployment (from 
Spain by way of Milan, the Alps, the upper Rhine) swift and professional, its 
troops moving to the battlefront from a wide array of Spanish bases and 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
No other European nation at the time could equal such force projection; Spain, 
it was clear, was still No. 1 militarily. Yet it was a country that, in the 
nonmilitary dimensions of power, was beginning to sag badly: enormous debts, 
inefficient industries, reliance on foreign manufactures, vested interests that 
debilitated rather than strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, little attention was paid to those features in the excitement of 
watching the glittering Spanish battalions pour into the Rhineland. By the 
1640s, however, the suspension of interest payments and declarations of 
bankruptcy by the Spanish Hapsburgs fully revealed the decline of Spanish 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a lesson here for the United States? 
</P>
<P>
No doubt many critics will rush in to claim that America in 1990 is not like 
Spain in 1634 (and they will be right; no two countries in history are ever 
alike). But that misses the basic point, which is that to remain No. 1 
generation after generation requires not just military capabilities, not just 
national will, but also a flourishing and efficient economic base on which the 
nation's military strength ultimately rests. 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is the larger irony of President Bush's bold decision to commit 
American forces in strength to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The cause may be a rightful one (as the Spaniards and British believed their 
causes to be rightful). The deployments may be impressive and the actual 
fighting by U.S. forces -- if it comes to that -- may also demonstrate 
efficiency and resolve. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is going to take national attention, energies and resources away 
from dealing with the signs of America's growing fiscal, technological and 
educational weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, like Philip IV of Spain, much prefers to be in the glorious role of 
commander-in-chief than to be haggling over budget deficits; and much of the 
media reflects the same bias. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant news item of recent weeks may, therefore, have occurred 
neither in Kennebunkport, nor in Baghdad, but in an inner-page article of the 
Wall Street Journal, where it was reported that next year's budget deficit will 
almost certainly be the largest one in American history, between $250 billion 
and $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the military deployment (estimated by some to reach $1.5 billion 
before October, even if no shots are fired), the likelihood that there would be 
smaller (or no) cuts in overall defense spending, the difficulty of imposing a 
gas-hike tax, the slowing of the economy and consequent drop in revenues, would 
all weaken America's fiscal position. In consequence, the article concluded, 
the "cuts" authorized by the Gramm-Rudman budget law will likely be canceled by 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any surprise that the dollar's value has been sagging, the stock market 
quaking and voices rising to demand that super-rich Japan and Germany help pay 
the spiraling cost of America's force projection? 
</P>
<P>
The American nation may get out of this within a short while, and without 
serious fighting and cost. But it may also find itself dragged into a lengthy 
and expensive stay in the Arab world, which will certainly worsen its fiscal 
position and make it increasingly dependent on foreign capital, just as 
occurred to Britain when it lingered too long "East of Aden," until the Suez 
crisis.

LOGJAM PUTS MORE UNINSURED ON THE ROAD;

<P>
AUTO INSURANCE: PROP. 103 HAS GONE NOWHERE, RATES ARE ABOUT TO RISE, AND 
SACRAMENTO DANCES AROUND THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY SNYDER, Harry Snyder is director of the West Coast regional office of 
Consumers Union. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The auto insurance crisis hasn't gone away and it's about to get much worse. 
Insurance rates will soon rise significantly. The number of uninsured drivers, 
already at a startling 25% statewide, will increase. Gov. George Deukmejian and 
the Legislature are trapped in a political minuet, unwilling to settle on 
legislative reforms that might head off this disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary rate freeze ordered to implement Proposition 103 is about to end 
and companies are poised to raise rates in the next few months. Then, the 75% 
of Californians who do buy auto insurance will again scream about 
affordability. Many will become uninsured drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the looming increases, we are seeing drastic changes in the 
California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan. The plan was intended to provide for 
drivers whose records were so bad that no private company would sell them a 
policy at an affordable price. It had in reality become the pressure valve for 
"good drivers" who just cannot afford policies in the ordinary market because 
premiums would be too high due to their age or where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Recent court-approved changes will force "good drivers" out of the assigned- 
risk plan, returning it to its original mission. But the staff of the 
state-administered plan estimates that nearly 70%, or 840,000, of the drivers 
insured under this program are "good drivers." Many, when pushed out of the 
state plan, will not be able to find an affordable policy elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The assigned-risk plan has also requested a rate increase of 165%. Bad drivers 
who are now buying insurance may not be able to afford nearly triple the 
current average of $675 for minimum coverage. 
</P>
<P>
We face the prospect of a state that purports to require drivers to be insured 
but in which the proportion of uninsured drivers may soon approach 50% -- 
higher in urban areas. Californians will not be able to afford insurance in 
either the voluntary market or in the assigned- risk plan. They will have 
received no help from Proposition 103 or from all of the promises of the 
Legislature and our governor. 
</P>
<P>
Each year for the past four years, our legislative leaders have said that auto 
insurance was one of their highest priorities. This year began with Deukmejian 
saying that he would work with the Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on 
auto-insurance reform, because it was so important to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of consumer and low-income groups drafted, with the support of 
Assemblyman Pat Johnston (D-Stockton), a plan that won the grudging support of 
some members of the insurance industry. This proposed low-cost, no-frills 
$180-a-year policy, based on New York's no-fault system, was approved by most 
of the policy analysts who looked at the measure. It had nearly universal 
editorial support across California. But it wasn't good enough for some members 
of the insurance industry, and the trial lawyers hated it because it hurt their 
ability to profit from every fender-bender. In January, the bill was defeated 
by these special interests. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has had months to work with the governor to come up with an 
alternative, to no avail. The governor waits for the insurance industry to tell 
him what it wants. The Speaker waits for the governor to tell him what the 
governor wants. The Senate Judiciary Committee waits for the Speaker to say 
what the Assembly and the Governor have agreed to. This is the legislative 
dance, a waltz in circles with no forward progress. 
</P>
<P>
The elected insurance commissioner provided for by Proposition 103 will take 
office just about the time when sticker shock hits the California driving 
public. But the insurance commissioner can't change the insurance laws. That's 
up to the governor and the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Our state's lawmakers refused to pass the workable, low-cost, no-frills policy 
in the Johnston bill. Neither the trial lawyers nor the insurance companies 
want to pay for reform, and both groups are happy with the status quo. After 
six months of dancing around, the politicians haven't been able to come up with 
a workable plan of their own. 
</P>
<P>
As this legislative session draws to a close, the Legislature and governor are 
flinging out new and untested ideas in a frantic effort to choreograph a happy 
ending. But they are still trying to satisfy the insurance industry and the 
trial lawyers. They are not doing right by California consumers, who need 
affordable auto insurance that will provide prompt, undisputed payment for 
minor accidents and force fraudulent claims out of the system. Consumers who 
need more than basic coverage should be able to buy it at fair prices. 
</P>
<P>
All of the parts to the solution are available and have been through many 
legislative hearings -- a low-cost no-frills policy, backed by auto-safety and 
anti-fraud measures. These reforms would combine the best time-tested ideas 
from other states and go far toward solving California's auto insurance crisis.

When the Cincinnati Reds were building their big lead in the National League 
West, Tom Browning and Jack Armstrong were the pitching stars. 
</P>
<P>
Those two, with considerable help from strong arms coming out of the bullpen, 
led the Reds to a 9 1/2-game lead before the season was half completed. 
</P>
<P>
Even though their two aces haven't won a game in two weeks, the Reds show no 
signs of relinquishing their grip on first place. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching stars now are Jose Rijo and Rick Mahler plus the strong arms -- 
Randy Myers, Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, who is making his contributions as a 
starter now. 
</P>
<P>
It was Rijo's turn to start Tuesday night at Cincinnati and he beat the St. 
Louis Cardinals, 2-1, with Myers getting his 26th save. Rijo went only five 
innings, but he drove in what proved to be the winning run on a bunt single in 
the second inning and improved his record to 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo wanted to talk about his batting contributions more than his pitching 
after he gave up six hits in five innings. He is hitting .421 in the last nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He noticed that third baseman Terry Pendleton backed off after the count 
reached 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him back off and said, 'Thank you.' I knew I had to drop it fair. Every 
time I've tried to do it, I've been successful. You've got to believe. I 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
Myers ended the game by picking Tim Jones off first base. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo has won twice and so has the surprising Mahler, since either Browning, who 
has been hurt, or Armstrong, who has been ineffective, has won. 
</P>
<P>
It was another tough loss for Joe Magrane (8-15). He gave up only four hits 
besides the two-out bunt single that scored Paul O'Neill from third. Another 
was a run-scoring triple in the first by Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rough situation," said Magrane, who gave up only one hit after the 
second. "I've pitched some good games, but the bottom line is I'm losing." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman was the Cardinal offense. He singled to stretch his hitting 
streak to 12 games, stole three bases and scored the only run on a single by 
Ozzie Smith in the third. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, San Diego 0 -- David Cone (10-7) has become the Mets' most 
dependable pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cone pitched his third consecutive complete game as the Mets celebrated their 
return home by moving to within two games of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The young right-hander pitched a five-hitter, four singles and a double by 
Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Teufel, getting a chance to start for the first time in 10 days, hit a 
two-run home run to lead the Mets' attack. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 9, Pittsburgh 0 -- The Pirates are in another slump, and this time it 
may wind up with them falling out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
They went four games in front in the East Thursday, have scored only six runs 
in the last four games, and all the Mets have had to do was go 2-2 and cut the 
lead to two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' latest hitting slump made a winner out of Charlie Leibrandt (6-8) 
at Atlanta. Leibrandt, who had lost five of his previous six decisions, held 
the Pirates to five hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
A two-run home run by Francisco Cabrera capped a three-run first inning off 
John Smiley (7-7) and it was a breeze for the Braves who have the worst record 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Houston 2 -- Ryne Sandberg hit a home run in the fourth inning at 
Houston to become the first second baseman to hit 30 home runs in consecutive 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg moved into a tie with Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla for the league home 
run lead. He also helped Greg Maddux improve to 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux, who pitched his seventh complete game, didn't allow a runner past 
second until the ninth when he lost his shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, San Francisco 2 -- The Giants are in danger of falling out of the 
race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gardner struck out 11 and gave up only three hits in six innings at 
Montreal, and the Giants fell 8 1/2 games behind Cincinnati. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
GREENWELL BACK IN SWING, RED SOX WIN, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Greenwell still hasn't regained his best home run swing, but he is 
wielding a timely bat in behalf of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell had three hits, including a two-run triple in the ninth inning 
Tuesday night at Cleveland that brought the Red Sox from behind to a 6-5 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's fifth victory in a row and the collapse of the Toronto Blue Jays has 
all but wiped out the race in the American League East. As recently as last 
Thursday, the Blue Jays were only a game behind and talking about taking over 
the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
But the Red Sox won three in a row at Toronto to take charge and, with the Blue 
Jays losing five in a row, have stretched their lead to six games. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians built leads of 3-1 and 4-3 and had their outstanding relief 
pitcher, Doug Jones, on the mound. He worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
But he opened the ninth by walking Carlos Quintana and Wade Boggs. Ellis Burks 
popped out, but Greenwell drilled a pitch into the gap in right center to score 
both runners. Greenwell scored on Dwight Evans' single and it turned out to be 
the important run. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gray, who made 10 consecutive appearances covering 14 2/3 innings without 
giving up a run, finally hit a wild streak and barely survived the bottom of 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who has become the closer the Red Sox didn't think they had after Jeff 
Reardon had to have surgery, earned his fifth save in the last seven Boston 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
He walked only two batters in the 10 appearances. But he gave up a single and a 
walk to the first two batters he faced, wild pitched in a run after a 
sacrifice, and, had the potential tying run on third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Gray struck out Chris James, then got Candy Maldonado on a forceout to save the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how fast we've moved out," Greenwell said. "We're definitely 
peaking now. We feel we can win every time out." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell, who has only nine home runs this season, is 17 for 44 (.386) in his 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Kansas City 2 -- The Athletics finally took advantage of the White 
Sox slump and moved in front by 6 1/2 games in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Tartabull hit a home run in the ninth inning at Oakland to give Kansas 
City a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The A's had the bases loaded with one out in the bottom of the ninth, but Mark 
McGwire struck out. On a 1-and-2 count, Terry Steinbach, a solid clutch hitter, 
looped a single into right-center to score two runs and win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (11-12) pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game. Tom Gordon 
missed the victory when Jeff Montgomery blew his lead. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Toronto 2 -- Even Dave Stieb, their best pitcher, couldn't stop 
the Blue Jays' skid. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker tagged the veteran right-hander for two home runs at Toronto and 
the Blue Jays lost their fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
While Stieb (16-5) was struggling, Jaime Navarro (5-5) was another pitcher who 
enjoyed the Blue Jays' slump. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro went the distance, giving up eight hits. In their five defeats, the 
Blue Jays have scored only four runs. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 39, Parker doesn't concede anything to the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for 18 years," Parker said after driving in three runs 
with Nos. 19 and 20. "The key is staying mentally tough." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 12, Chicago 6 -- The White Sox are also in a slump. Kent Hrbek hit a 
two-run home run into the upper deck in the fifth inning at Minneapolis to put 
the Twins ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, who have lost four in a row, have been hammered in the last two 
by the Twins. They have been outscored, 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
Hrbek was one of four Twins who had two hits in a game that became a rout with 
a five-run eighth. 
</P>
<P>
New York 11, Baltimore 3 -- The best cure for one of Jesse Barfield's slumps is 
to face Oriole pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield went four for four at Baltimore, including a two-run, tiebreaking home 
run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield has hit five of his 20 home runs in 26 at-bats against the Orioles 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Detroit 3 -- Edgar Martinez hit a two-run home run with one out in 
the ninth at Seattle to give the Mariners the victory. 
</P>
<P>
All the runs came on home runs. Ken Griffey Jr. hit a two-run smash for 
Seattle, and Lou Whitaker hit a three-run homer to put the Tigers ahead. DAN

THE BOTTOM TEN: AFTER '89, BRUINS HAVE NO PLACE TO GO BUT UP

THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
The battle cry for UCLA's 1990 football team is: "Well, there's always 
basketball season!" The Ruins sagged to 3-7-1 last year, though they did manage 
to get by San Diego State, 28-25 -- hence, the rumors that UCLA is preparing to 
jump to the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA ranks as the plowhorse favorite to repeat as Bottom Ten champion, which 
would qualify the team for an appearance in Shreveport, La., in the former 
Independence Bowl, recently renamed the Poulan Weed-Eater Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Other contenders are perennial pushover Losing State University (4-7) and a 
flurry of teams on losing streaks, including Nebraska, which is trying to 
recover from its morale-shattering 24-point defeat on New Year's Day. 
Northwestern (0-11) is ineligible for the title because of the Bottom Ten's 
no-repeat rule (no school may be champion more than 20 times in the same 
century). 
</P>
<P>
ROUT OF THE WEEK: Baylor over Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL CITATION: A member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors proposed 
that seized drug money be donated to the beleaguered Freedom Bowl football game 
in Anaheim so that it could attract some big-name schools for a change. The 
proposal was turned down, despite his suggestion that the game be renamed the 
Freedom From Drugs Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
PIGGY, PIGGY: Disneyland Pigskin Classic officials charged $28 for every seat 
for the Colorado-Tennessee game, thereby managing the remarkable feat of 
holding down attendance to 33,458 at Anaheim Stadium for a season opener 
between two nationally ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
It seemed a shame for the 1989 regular NFL season to end just when the 
Performing Bears had so much momentum going against them. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Coach Mike Ditka's midseason predictions, Chicago proved incapable 
of winning a game over the last six weeks. The team's most explosive moment 
occurred when Ditka sacked offensive coordinator Greg Landry, ripping the 
clipboard out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to break up a losing combination, Ditka has brought back quarterbacks 
Mike Tomczak and Jim Harbaugh (not to mention Landry), making the Bears the 
early Bottom Ten favorite. But they'll have to outdon't teams led by Vinny 
Interceptaverde (Tampa Bay), Jeff (Boy) George (Indianapolis) and Gary 
Hoge-whatever (Phoenix). 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bill Bidwill, whose Cardinals lost their last six games, is on a roll of 
a different kind. A Kingman, Ariz., developer is selling toilet paper bearing 
the likeness of the Cardinals' owner. 
</P>
<P>
CRUMMY OPENER: San Diego at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL USE OF THE HANDS: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the 
claims of a 49er fan who said that when he was arrested at a Ram game in 
Anaheim for cursing and making "rude hand gestures" police exerted excessive 
force. They used a finger hold on him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
GEOGRAPHY LESSON: Pittsburgh running back Merril Hoge, told he wouldn't be 
allowed into Canada on a promotional trip because he didn't have any ID, said, 
"I didn't know Canada was outside of the U.S."

SUPPORTERS RALLY FOR HUNTING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battle lines were drawn when pro-hunting state legislators staged a rally on 
the capitol steps at Sacramento last week. The shooting will start when the 
dove season opens in the state Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was held on the day the Fish and Game Commission approved the dove 
hunt in the face of hunting opposition. It is California's second most popular 
hunt, after deer. An estimated 161,000 participated last year. Unlike mountain 
lions, bears or bighorn sheep, it is a more realistic measure of the hunters' 
resolve to pursue their sport. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized and led by Assemblyman Chris Chandler (R-Yuba City), drew 
an estimated 700 to 1,000 hunting partisans. Several legislators spoke, and 
their comments were strident and inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
Some said hunting was a "fundamental right" and "a part of California's 
heritage and lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
In Utah and other states, schools close for the opening of deer season; in 
California, most people would rather close deer season. 
</P>
<P>
So pro-hunting committees and coalitions are being organized. But unless they 
stop the theatrics and rhetoric, it's unlikely that the non-hunters will take 
them seriously. Also, such a tactic will do little to persuade the anti-hunters 
to adopt the premise that wildlife should be regarded less as humans -- the 
"Bambi" syndrome -- and more as a renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to reasonable minds to discuss the issue: The Department of Fish and 
Game's contention that hunting is a necessary tool of wildlife management. Must 
some die so the rest may live? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Yeates, the lawyer who represented the Fund for Animals and the Animal 
Legal Defense Fund in challenging the DFG's migratory bird document, said: "I 
would like to get off the anti-hunting binge and focus on habitat protection, 
resource protection and stuff like that, and I would like to see Fund for 
Animals and other groups get involved in those issues." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to argue with anti-hunters when they say the Fish and Game 
Commission and the Department of Fish and Game are pro-hunting at heart. Only 
three of the five commissioners participated in last week's dove hearing. Jack 
Murdy of Newport Beach and Benjamin Biaggini of San Francisco were on separate 
vacations in Europe -- hunting grouse and pheasant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
DOVES -- The Department of Fish and Game has a "Dove Hotline" for information 
on the hunt starting a half-hour before dawn Saturday: (213) 590-5045. Although 
cold snaps in Central California and storms in the southern deserts have 
scattered some birds, reports from Ventura County south indicate the presence 
of large flocks of white-wing and mourning doves. DFG Capt. Bill Powell said 
the Imperial Valley has "the highest concentration of white-winged doves that 
people remember seeing." White-wings may be taken only in Imperial, Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties. Bag and possession limits are 10 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
SALTWATER -- Cabo has picked up with a steady parade of dorado to 45 pounds, 
according to Darrell Primrose of the Finesterra Tortuga fleet. Dave Snyder, Los 
Angeles, landed one weighing 67 pounds. Striped marlin are slow because, some 
say, the water is too warm, but Primrose said "sailfish are everywhere" and 
yellowfin in the 30-pound range are in "the longest run of tuna I have ever 
seen here." Blue marlin are running 300 to 400 pounds. . . . Thirty anglers 
aboard Bob Burns' Red Rooster III on a five-day trip 200 miles west of San 
Diego returned Sunday with 231 yellowfin, 191 dorado and 125 yellowtail, among 
other catches. . . . Bill Roecker of South Coast Sportfishing magazine says the 
dorado are still in California waters. You just have to find the right kelp 
paddies. Roecker was with 15 anglers fishing seven miles off Oceanside and 
Carlsbad last week. Each got his limit of 10, from 5 to 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
BOATS -- The Coast Guard said 896 Americans died in boating accidents in 1989, 
and the Labor Day death toll is 73% higher than any other September weekend 
during the last 18 years. Alcohol is involved in 50% of the fatal accidents, 
and four of five victims are not wearing lifejackets. Another factor is poor 
lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
FLY FISHING -- The East Fork Fly Fishing Store in Irvine will hold a beginners' 
class on Sept. 15 and an intermediate class on Sept. 29, with 1989 ACA national 
dry fly champion Matt Rickerd as instructor. Fee is $50. Details: (714) 
724-8840. . . . Phil Eubanks will teach 1 1/2-day introductory classes each 
weekend in September at Bob Marriott's Fullerton store. Charlene Hanson 
instructs in fly tying each Monday and Friday night. Details: (714) 5225-1827. 
</P>
<P>
RECORDS -- California-caught fish recently approved as world records by the 
International Game Fish Assn.: A 21-pound largemouth bass, 12-pound line class, 
caught by Castaic resident Robert Crupi at Lake Castaic on March, 9, 1990; a 
31-pound white seabass, eight-pound line class, caught by Michael Franklin off 
Santa Catalina Island on March 17, 1990, and a 27-pound striped bass 
(landlocked), eight-pound tippet fly rod class, caught by Alfred Whitehurst in 
Merced County's San Luis Reservoir on March 24, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
TOURNAMENT -- Bill Nott, who organized and lobbied for the interests of the 
Southern California sportfishing industry during his 17 years as head of the 
Sportfishing Assn. of California, will be a beneficiary of the third annual 
Oceans Foundation/SAC Oceans Shoot-Out tournament out of San Diego Oct. 2-3. 
Successor Bob Fletcher of SAC said he has raised $35,000 toward the goal of 
$150,000 for an annuity to pay Nott's enormous medical expenses from 
respiratory illness. The account will receive half of the proceeds from the 
tournament, which will have four-man teams on five or more boats. The entry fee 
is $350 per angler, including food, bunk and Mexican license. More information: 
(619) 226-6455.

SCREEN STYLE: WILD AND WEIRD WEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THE FILM: "Wild at Heart" 
</P>
<P>
THE SET UP: David Lynch, director of television's quirky "Twin Peaks," 
showcases another of his own strange visions. The plot stays simple: Sailor and 
Lula (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, pictured) hit the road after her mom, who's 
not crazy about him, takes a contract out on his life. In their travels they 
meet up with a wild assortment of oddball personalities and purely absurd 
situations. The world according to Lula is, "wild at heart and weird on top." 
And it's rated R. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Patricia Norris, who served as costumer and production designer on 
the film, says that from Day One she realized the clothes would have to be a 
bit bizarre. They're not "real clothes, as in things you would actually wear," 
she says. "There's something about this film that's beyond your sense of 
reality." Sailor's best outfit is a sublime and strange mix: black shirt over 
black jeans and one of the loudest-color snake-skin jackets this side of a 
Motley Crue video. "It's somewhere between cool and annoying," Norris says. 
Lula's look favors underwear-as-outerwear, her basic uniform being a sheer 
lingerie teddy over tights and cowboy boots. "The underwear is just fun," 
Norris says. "She dresses the way you'd never look around mommy." 
</P>
<P>
THE STORES: Wardrobe is minimal here, since both romantic leads wear only what 
they tossed in the car before they left town. "It's sort of a capsule 
wardrobe," says Norris. Lula's trademark lingerie was picked up at Trashy 
Lingerie on La Cienega. Avoiding labels and well-known stores Norris, found 
Sailor's wardrobe in what seems a likely spot -- Nicolas Cage's closet. 
"Nicolas brought in the jacket," Norris says. "I saw it and realized that 
jacket was going to guide my life. I made up three of them in a more obnoxious 
shade of orange." The snakeskin blazer carries thematic as well as visual 
punch. Twice in the film we hear Sailor state, "This here jacket's a symbol of 
my individuality and belief in personal freedom." Words to live -- and dress --

Burning Candle as a Treasured Gift 
</P>
<P>
For a lift or a gift, consider the scented, handcrafted Treasure Candle, which 
contains tiny treasures that are revealed as it burns. 
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen designs, but the pyramids, large (6-inch base; 6 inches tall) 
and small (4-by-4 inches) are the most popular, said Frances McCaffrey, the 
candle's designer and a Hollywood artist and actress. Among the other designs: 
spheres, eggs, hearts, pigs, rabbits, stars and Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
They are priced from $10 to $30, depending on size and the treasures within. 
All the designs contain a crystal and have varied treasures, such as unicorns, 
dragons, elephants, whales and hearts. 
</P>
<P>
After two to three hours of burning, the first treasures appear, McCaffrey 
said, adding that the candles will burn from 10 to 30 hours. The treasures are 
"right in the wax, so you just take them out with tweezers or chopsticks and 
wipe them off." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the proceeds from each candle go to support Tierra del Sol in Sunland, 
an institute for the mentally disabled, McCaffrey said, adding that Amnesty 
International receives $1 from each sale of her latest creation, a dove-shaped 
Freedom Candle containing a piece of the Berlin Wall. The Freedom Candle sells 
for $40. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Candles are available nationwide in gift and specialty shops. Stores 
in the Southern California area carrying them include Missouri Trader in 
Hollywood, American Collectibles in Sherman Oaks, Nature's Own at the Beverly 
Center and in Santa Monica, Aura's in West Hollywood, Lolita's in Century City 
and Moonrose in San Juan Capistrano. If you can't find them in your area, 
contact Treasure Candles, 3208 W. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, Calif. 90068; 
(213) 876-MELT or (818) 761-MELT.

Paper Plate Dispenser Offers Extra Storage 
</P>
<P>
If you use paper plates at home, in your RV or boat, consider Pop-A-Plate, a 
durable plastic dispenser that fits neatly under a cabinet or shelf to provide 
extra storage space and a tidy kitchen. Paper plates pull out easily one at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The dispenser, which comes in white or almond, holds up to 100 plates at a 
time, depending on thickness. It works well for disposable 9-inch diameter 
plates -- paper, plastic or foam. The top half of the unit attaches to the 
underside of a cabinet with three screws, which are included. The plates go in 
the bottom, which slips into the top. 
</P>
<P>
Pop-A-Plate retails for about $6. It's available nationwide in groceries, 
drugstores and department stores. In Southern California, you can find the 
dispenser at Lucky, Alpha-Beta, Fedco, Builders' Square, Camping World, 
Fredson's RV in Santa Ana and selected Sav-On, Safeway and Longs Drug Stores. 
If you can't find the unit in your area, contact Perfection Products Inc., 
22672 Lambert St., Suite 620, El Toro, Calif. 92630; (714) 770-3489.

BID TO EXPOSE A 'FALSE PROPHET' FALLS SHORT; 
</P>
<P>
THE FALSE PROPHET RABBI MEIR KAHANE, FROM FBI INFORMANT TO KNESSET MEMBER BY 
ROBERT I. FRIEDMAN LAWRENCE HILL BOOKS/CHICAGO REVIEW PRESS $19.95, 240 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My journal contains two entries on the subject of Meir Kahane, the 
American-born rabbi who founded the Jewish Defense League in Brooklyn and later 
the Kach party in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
I copied out these passages from a 1984 article in The Times because then, as 
now, Kahane poses an acute moral dilemma for the Jewish people, here and in the 
Jewish homeland: Is violence the only appropriate weapon for a people nearly 
exterminated in the Holocaust and still threatened with extermination by their 
enemies in the Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
"It is not terrorism. It is vengeance," Kahane once said of his own taste for 
violence against adversaries, especially Arabs. "Vengeance is a fundamental 
principle of Judaism, and I will debate any rabbi on Wilshire Boulevard on that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
"If our enemies had wanted to do us incalculable harm," observed Gideon 
Hausner, the man who prosecuted Adolf Eichmann for his crimes against humanity, 
"they could not have done so more effectively than to have planted a person 
like Kahane in our midst." 
</P>
<P>
The same moral dilemma flashes rather fitfully through the pages of "The False 
Prophet" by Robert I. Friedman, which is both a political biography of Kahane 
and a hit piece that depicts Kahane as a "con man," a "philanderer," an 
informer, a rabble-rouser and a bloodthirsty villain. 
</P>
<P>
The author insists that Kahane, a man who has been written out of Israeli 
politics precisely because his ideas are so repugnant, is somehow emblematic of 
what's wrong with the Jewish state. "Rabbi Meir Kahane's life and times," 
Friedman writes, "are a looking glass into the dark side of Israel's soul." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is an accomplished investigative reporter for the Village Voice, among 
other newspapers, and his book is a spider's web of names, dates and places in 
which he has ensnared his prey. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he makes a convincing case that Kahane and the JDL ("a strange 
brew of kooks, right-wing idealogues and dreamers") were a cat's paw for the 
FBI, Israeli intelligence operatives and what Friedman calls a "covert cabal of 
right-wing zealots" (including the future prime minister of Israel, Yitzhak 
Shamir), who encouraged them toward provocative and sometimes openly violent 
attacks on such targets as black activists, the anti-war movement and, 
especially, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Kahane makes a case against himself and his personal political 
party, Kach, whenever he opens his mouth. "I get up in the Knesset and say: 
'When I'm prime minister no Arab will be hurt by Jewish terrorists because 
there won't be an Arab left in Israel!' " he boasts. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman openly blames Kahane for the 1985 bombing in Santa Ana that killed 
Alex Odeh, an Arab-American community activist. "The rabbi was laying the 
groundwork for a terrorist underground in the United States that the FBI says 
carried out a string of bombings in 1985 that killed two persons, including 
Alex Odeh," Friedman writes. "Kahane had long dreamed of forging a Jewish 
underground that would spread fear and shatter the souls of his enemies. Now 
just a year after his Knesset victory, he had professional assassins roaming 
America." 
</P>
<P>
"The False Prophet" struck me as a hit piece because Friedman appears to be 
driven by a visceral hatred of Kahane. The author does not try to discredit 
Kahane's racist and anti-democratic ideas by showing why they are morally wrong 
or politically unworkable. Rather, he tries to convince us that Kahane's ideas 
are bad because he is so bad -- according to Friedman, he's a loser, a nut and 
a very nasty fellow. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Friedman dwells on the sordid details of Kahane's adolescent sexual 
experiences, his "ungracious" demeanor as a poker player, even the fact that 
Kahane is a stutterer. We are given a leering account of a particularly ugly 
incident in which Kahane apparently jilted a woman whom he picked up in a bar 
during one of his self-appointed undercover operations; the woman, who may have 
been pregnant with Kahane's child, threw herself into the East River. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Friedman scolds the New York Times for failing to print the 
story of Kahane's dead lover back in 1971: "If the paper of record had 
published all it knew about Kahane, a self-righteous, Orthodox rabbi who 
constantly moralized about personal relationships, then perhaps both he and the 
JDL would have been destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
The animus in Friedman's aside illustrates exactly what's wrong with "The False 
Prophet." He imagines that Kahane (and the movement he created) will somehow 
shrivel up and blow away if only the world knows what an unsavory character 
Kahane really is. Thanks to him, now we know. 
</P>
<P>
But I fear that Friedman will be proven wrong about what it takes to eradicate 
"Kahaneism." And the moral dilemma -- the agonizing question of the role of 
violence in the destiny of the Middle East -- remains very much with us.

The reports released Monday on the Ahmanson and Jordan ranch developments found 
that the two projects, as they are proposed, would have significant and 
unavoidable effects on air quality and traffic, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John Flynn said the reports "came up with what I predicted, which is 
that there are so many problems that I do not see how they could ever be 
mitigated." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson and Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, who will take 
office Jan. 1, said that the increased traffic and smog that would be generated 
by the two developments outweigh any benefits they would provide to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"My inclination is to think that this is not going to be something that I 
support," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Lacey, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has 
repeatedly said she opposes both developments. Supervisor Jim Dougherty's term 
expires in November, and candidates Vicky Howard and Bill Davis, both Simi 
Valley council members, have not taken a position on the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option 
to purchase and develop Jordan Ranch from entertainer Bob Hope, said he is not 
surprised by the comments. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't change our plans," Maas said. "We pledge to work very hard, whether 
it's with the county or the city of Simi Valley, to address all of the negative 
impacts." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating opposition from the supervisors, Hope in July asked Simi Valley to 
annex Jordan Ranch along with 3,600 acres of his Runkle Ranch northeast of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has petitioned the Local Agency Formation Commission for a 
preliminary ruling to determine whether annexation of Jordan Ranch is feasible. 
The commission is scheduled to take up the issue at its next meeting, Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maas said he would consider an alternative presented in the 
environmental impact report regarding the incorporation of Oak Park and Jordan 
Ranch as a city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're open to any ideas," Maas said. "Geographically, that makes a lot of 
sense. Politically, there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
One such issue is whether Oak Park residents want to become a city. Residents 
there are considering the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor would be whether the two communities combined would be able to 
generate enough revenue to support incorporation, said Dennis Hawkins, a senior 
planner with the Ventura County Resources Agency. Hawkins said LAFCO would have 
to conduct an incorporation study to make that determination. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to causing significant increases in traffic and smog, the 
environmental reports released Monday concluded that the Jordan Ranch housing 
project would destroy 10 to 20 acres of wetlands and 1,100 trees in Liberty and 
Cheeseboro canyons and development areas. 
</P>
<P>
But Maas said Hope's offer to sell and donate 5,700 acres in the Santa Monica 
and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies if the Jordan Ranch development is 
approved should be an overriding consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at the entirety of what is being proposed," Maas said. "Our 
project clearly benefits all of Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
Maas also noted that the environmental report on Jordan Ranch is based on an 
outdated design proposal and that Hope and the developer already have 
voluntarily agreed to reduce the size of the housing project by about 40%. The 
report analyzes the original proposal for 1,152 residences on the ranch and a 
four-lane access road, instead of a two-lane road and 750 houses now being 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, however, said 750 houses still constitutes too much development for 
the ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, they'd have to whittle it down to 50, and even if 
they did that, the golf course alone would have devastating impacts" on Palo 
Comado Canyon in the development area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the environmental report on the Ahmanson Ranch development concluded 
that emissions from traffic generated by the project would far exceed county 
air-quality standards. The amount of affordable housing in the area will not be 
sufficient to accommodate the number of jobs created by the development, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Land Co. has proposed building 3,000 houses, 3 million square feet 
of office space, two hotels and two golf courses on nearly 2,000 acres of 
vacant land. About 3,000 acres of the 5,477-acre Ahmanson Ranch will be left in 
open space or be used for community recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
One alternative presented in the environmental report was for the developer to 
scale back the project to include 250,000 to 400,000 square feet of commercial 
space and to reduce the number of housing units to between 600 and 900. It also 
advised that development should only occur in the south-central, southeastern 
and southwestern portions of the project site. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ahmanson Land Co. said they want more time to review the 
environmental report before making any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk said that although she likes the design and some of the other 
amenities in the Ahmanson project, she simply cannot support it because of its 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal would be wonderful in Iowa," VanderKolk said, "but it's terrible 
for the property where they want to build it." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, on the other hand, is less critical of Ahmanson than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look at the aerial of the Ahmanson project, it's surrounded by urban 
development," Flynn said, "so it seems to present a different picture than 
Jordan, especially if Victory Boulevard goes through." 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Land Co. has proposed extending Victory Boulevard in the San 
Fernando Valley west into Ventura County, where the housing development would 
be located. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal has come under attack by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy 
Picus. She is concerned that a large amount of traffic would be funneled onto 
Victory Boulevard in West Hills, which is in her district. The project is 
expected to generate an additional 70,000 vehicle trips per day throughout the 
surrounding area, Ventura County officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The first public hearing on the environmental documents is scheduled for Oct. 
31. at the Ventura County Hall of Administration.

NEW GUIDELINES TREAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LIKE ANY OTHER CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under new guidelines for prosecuting domestic violence, there is one question 
police will no longer will ask battered spouses: "Do you want to press 
charges?" 
</P>
<P>
The new countywide guidelines take responsibility away from the victims, who 
are often too afraid to press charges, and give it to law enforcement officials 
to decide whether a case should be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crime whether the victim wants it prosecuted or not," said Ashley 
Walker-Hooper, co-chair of the San Diego County Task Force on Domestic 
Violence. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some abusers have gone unchecked because incidents were not 
reported by police or not prosecuted when victims refused to press charges, 
said Casey Gwinn, supervisor of the Domestic Violence Unit for the city 
attorney's office and another co-chair of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Women often decide not to press charges because they fear retaliation, don't 
want to put their husband or boyfriend in jail for fear of losing their 
financial support, or because they simply don't want to get involved, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Gwinn and law enforcement members of the task force developed a set of 
guidelines, which they call a protocol, to be used uniformly throughout the 
county. The goal is to treat a domestic violence case like any other crime: If 
the evidence is there, prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
For the abusers, getting caught can be the first step in stopping, say people 
who work with battered women. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't get arrested, they think they can get away with it," said 
Carolyn Ford, shelter director for the YWCA's Battered Women's Services. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 15,417 cases of domestic violence were reported in San Diego County, 
6,138 of those in San Diego, said Roni Brodeth, a researcher for the San Diego 
Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, representing about 100 agencies countywide, was set up in June, 
1989, to combat escalating domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
Such violence includes abuse between husbands and wives, people who are dating 
and people involved in homosexual relationships, Gwinn said. About 98% of the 
abusers in domestic violence cases are men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, announced last week, were unanimously approved earlier this 
month by county law enforcement agencies, which will put them into practice 
over the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Although arrests and prosecution in domestic violence cases are at the heart of 
the task force's work, setting up standard procedures for emergency dispatchers 
and officers who have initial contact with the victims have also been included. 
</P>
<P>
There have been incidents in which 911 operators have not dispatched police as 
quickly as they should have when a domestic-violence call for help came in, the 
task force found. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear 911 tapes every day where we hear them say to the victim, 'Do you want 
to press charges?' " Gwinn said. "That's a stupid question; it doesn't matter 
if the victim wants to press charges." 
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines say that, like police, 911 operators must concentrate on 
victim safety and not the legal future of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Any comment or statement which seeks to place the responsibility for 
enforcement action with the victim is inappropriate," the protocol says. 
</P>
<P>
Gwinn cites a domestic violence case in Los Angeles to emphasize the 
importantance of reacting quickly to spousal abuse calls. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, a woman called 911 saying her husband was going to kill her. 
The 911 dispatcher told her they couldn't send anyone out until the husband 
showed up. About 25 minutes later, the man showed up and shot the woman to 
death, along with three of her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"911 should have told (her) to get out of the house, to go hide," Gwinn said. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also set forth a "pro-arrest policy," meaning that making an 
arrest and taking a suspected offender to jail is the preferred action whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
A checklist has been set up to help officers collect evidence and investigators 
follow up. 
</P>
<P>
Although many domestic violence arrests involve felonies, a vast majority of 
the cases end up being prosecuted as misdemeanors to keep the courts from being 
overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
"It would bury the court system," Gwinn said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said prosecuting cases as misdemeanors has proven effective because it 
gets the justice system involved. An offender will usually serve some time in 
jail, go through a long-term counseling program and be required to do public 
service work. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence is also one of a handful of misdemeanors in which an offender 
can be taken to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Despite jail crowding, misdemeanor domestic violence suspects that warrant 
jailing will continue to be booked into county jails because a court order 
mandates it, said Assistant Sheriff Ken Wigginton, who is in charge of 
detention services in the county. Felony suspects are automatically booked. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence can be considered a felony if a victim suffers injuries that 
require medical treatment and a misdemeanor if no treatment was necessary, 
Gwinn said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is adamant about pursuing incidents of domestic violence more 
aggressively, noting that of the 22 domestic violence homicides last year, all 
involved prior misdemeanor incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody says it's just a misdemeanor, they don't know what they're 
talking about," Gwinn said. "It's a warning sign of a possible homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcers countywide are working out plans to implement the task force's 
guidelines by circulating them to supervisors and officers and giving short 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that we'll all be doing it the same way," said 
Cmdr. Myron Klippert of the county Sheriff's Department.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DEPOT PIGEONS UPROOSTED,TAKEN FOR FIRST-CLASS RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 8, 1915, a white-bearded gent named Oliver J. Stough, San Diego's last 
surviving veteran of the Mexican-American War, was given the honor of buying 
the first train ticket at the just-completed Santa Fe Depot downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that the depot's first pigeon, if it was not already lying in 
wait for Mr. Stough, arrived soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, travelers and employees at the downtown depot, known for 
its 80-foot-high, open-beam ceiling and Mission Revival architecture, have 
lived beneath a fecal Sword of Damocles. 
</P>
<P>
Boom and bust, war and peace, it's been Man versus Bird. Man was annoyed, but 
Bird was hardy. 
</P>
<P>
Now Amtrak is declaring it has finally persuaded the depot's pigeons to move 
along and foul no more. If so, it's none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The pigeon (stuff) was everywhere, it was real bad," said custodian Frank 
Buford. "It was on the floor, on the seats in the waiting room, outside, 
inside, everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Victory has many fathers, and so it is with the pigeon project: Santa Fe, 
Amtrak, Catellus Development Corp. (the property manager), and Truly Nolen 
Exterminating Inc. 
</P>
<P>
As with so many successful battle tactics, the pigeon removal had a startling 
simplicity. Thin black netting was used to corral the pigeons nesting in the 
beams of the waiting room and the covered walkway on the western side. Most 
pigeons fled, but some stood their ground. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five of the friendly but filthy birds had to be relocated. At a cost of 
$11,547 for the pigeon project, that works out to $461 per bird. 
</P>
<P>
For that amount, each pigeon could spend three nights in the Hotel del 
Coronado, but, as you know, room service and valet parking mean little or 
nothing to the average pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly invisible to the naked eye, the netting has been left in place to 
prevent a return of rafter roosting. Also, Roost-No-More sticky stuff has been 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any pigeons around here lately," said Herb Carter, who runs the 
depot's information desk. "But I have seen some sparrows." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Henderson Connection 
</P>
<P>
The effort to recall San Diego City Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt begins its 
petition drive later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernhardt camp suggests that Councilman Bruce Henderson is the unseen force 
behind the drive to boot her from office. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A is the fact that one of the major recallers is Clairemont land 
surveyor Michael Pallamary, an avid Henderson backer and a Henderson appointee 
to a Mission Bay advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson used Pallamary's back yard in 1987 to announce his candidacy. Now 
Pallamary is spreading anti-Bernhardt flyers in shopping center parking lots 
and is ready to start gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
But he insists he's not just doing Henderson's dirty work. He says he decided 
that Bernhardt deserved the heave-ho long before he discussed the idea with 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
P.S.: City Manager John Lockwood has asked Pallamary to step down from the 
Mission Bay Capital Outlay Oversight Committee while the recall is under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OK, but Wear Your Seat Belt 
</P>
<P>
On the move. 
</P>
<P>
* Park and ride. 
</P>
<P>
Marines at Camp Pendleton who have had their on-base driving privileges revoked 
are being given amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
There's a catch. The all-clear is only good long enough for Marines to drive to 
base, park and hitch a ride to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
* Enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps will make $8 to $22.50 extra a month for 
being sent to Saudi Arabia. Nothing extra for officers. 
</P>
<P>
If the shooting starts or is imminent, the "danger pay/hostile fire" bonus 
jumps to $110 a month, officers included. 
</P>
<P>
* As he awaits sentencing, Richard T. Silberman has a new job at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center: working in the library. 
</P>
<P>
* South County bumper sticker: "Pray for Me. I Drive Highway 94."

NLRB CANCELS LABOR HEARINGS; BLAMES BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All unfair labor practice hearings have been canceled by National Labor 
Relations Board officials because of a budget shortfall that has hampered the 
federal agency and threatened its employees with temporary layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellations affect every NLRB field and regional office in the nation, 
including the office in San Diego. William Pate, NLRB deputy regional attorney 
in Los Angeles, said the shortage of funds has caused the cancellations of 10 
hearings in the region and one in San Diego that began on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego hearing resulted from unfair labor practice charges that were 
leveled against the Union-Tribune Publishing Co. by the San Diego Newspaper 
Guild during a bitter and lengthy contract dispute that ended earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Guild administrative officer Bill Knight said he was "disappointed and shocked" 
by the sudden cancellation on the same day the hearing began. The hearing was 
scheduled to continue Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
County labor leaders reacted with anger Tuesday when told that NLRB 
investigators were instructed by agency officials in Washington to curtail 
their queries into charges of unfair labor practices lodged by labor unions and 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
"This means the whole process (investigating allegations of unfair labor 
practice) will be delayed," said Joe Francis, executive secretary-treasurer of 
the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council. "It's not the swiftest process 
to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Francis, who is the top labor official in the county, said any hearing delays 
or cancellations caused by the NLRB's budget woes will favor employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, most of the charges presented to the NLRB are made by labor," 
said Francis. "Delays have been a standard tactic of employers. This will only 
help employers. This will have a tremendous effect on labor relations." 
</P>
<P>
Claude Marston, resident officer of the San Diego NLRB office, said he and his 
fellow workers were ordered Monday to cancel all hearings on calendar for 
September and not to schedule any new ones. 
</P>
<P>
He said it's uncertain if any hearings will be scheduled in October. 
</P>
<P>
Marston said Tuesday that he was not sure how many local hearings would have 
been scheduled in September. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, from the NLRB regional office in Los Angeles, said he does not know the 
size of the budget shortfall or what caused it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the details for the reason for the shortage of funds," Pate said. 
"But there has been a shortage that requires a curtailment of our activities 
until the end of the fiscal year." 
</P>
<P>
The federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Marston said that travel to investigate allegations of unfair labor practice 
was also "severely limited," forcing NLRB investigators to ask witnesses to 
drive to downtown San Diego to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can still investigate unfair labor practice charges, but that's about all 
we can do for the moment," said Marston. 
</P>
<P>
The eight employees of the San Diego NLRB office have also been notified that 
they will be laid off for eight days in October, Marston added. Six of the 
employees are investigators and attorneys.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI; 
</P>
<P>
CLUB'S PLAQUE SHOWS GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the best views of Ojai can be found on the Dennison Grade overlook where 
a scene of the mythical Shangri-La was filmed for Frank Capra's 1937 classic, 
"Lost Horizon." 
</P>
<P>
Sightseers who pause at the turnout along the serpentine climb of California 
150, linking the lower and upper Ojai valleys, are finding the horizon easier 
to identify now. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club of Ojai has installed an interpretive plaque that identifies a 
dozen geographical points. Most are visible from the overlook. 
</P>
<P>
Cast in bronze are White Ledge Peak, Three Sisters Peak, Chief Peak, Nordhoff 
Peak, Matilija Twin Peaks and the 6,244-foot-high Topatopa Peak. Also marked 
are Horn, Senior and Gridley canyons, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Club member Jane McCarthy, marketing director at Ojai Valley Community 
Hospital, said it was educational for many of the 65 professional and business 
people in Rotary to learn the names of the mountains and canyons they see 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
The plaque's installation and a ribbon-cutting ceremony Aug. 15, the 
culmination of the club's nine-month project to beautify the overlook site, 
were marked by commendations from County Supervisor Maggie Erickson's office 
and Ojai Mayor Nina Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
Using $13,000 of its members' donations and much of their time to haul trash 
away from the overlook, the club paved the small parking area, built stone 
walls and benches, installed garbage cans and put up fencing to keep sightseers 
from wandering farther onto private property. 
</P>
<P>
Local contractor Ernest Ford, whose property includes the vista point, was 
thinking of sealing it off after years of putting up with trespassers and 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people dumped garbage up there," McCarthy said. "We had a massive 
cleanup last November and several mini-cleanups since then." 
</P>
<P>
"It's our gift to Ojai," said project coordinator Larry Wilde, an Ojai real 
estate broker. He credited former club president Roger Phelps, an Ojai 
optometrist, for directing the effort, stonemason David Lee for contributing 
his skills and Ojai artist Kent Butler for sketching the plaque's mountain 
relief. THIA BELL

County Issue Will the county program to reduce car trips succeed in fighting 
air pollution? 
</P>
<P>
Starting Nov. 1, Ventura County employers with 100 or more workers must develop 
plans to reduce their employees' use of automobiles. Two deadlines for starting 
the program, referred to as Rule 210, have been missed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Florence S. Taylor

<P>

District 
</P>
<P>
 It will, as long as employers comply with the rule as they must. Ultimately, 
all employers in the county with 50 or more employees at a single work site 
must develop and submit plans to reduce motor vehicle ridership in order to 
meet Environmental Protection Agency and court mandates. Certainly, the 
Department of the Navy is prepared to cooperate and comply with these 
requirements. As a major employer and good citizen in the county, the Navy 
supports this effort to improve the environment for all of us.

</P>
<P>
 VCEDA has been actively working with the county Air Pollution Control Board on 
all levels of the air-quality management plan. Most industries here use 
state-of-the-art technology and their emissions are as tightly controlled as 
possible until new technology becomes available. We support the concept of Rule 
210, because the largest single source of air pollution in Ventura County is 
from vehicular use. We have supported ongoing educational programs to encourage 
residents' use of car-pooling, van-pooling, mass transit and other alternative 
means of transportation. But people have a love affair with the car in Southern 
California. To change our lifestyle is going to require a lot of education 
and/or financial incentives. Whether Rule 210 succeeds or not is going to 
depend on the employees seeing the benefits of trip reduction. A question is: 
How far can you go to enforce the program without violating individual rights? 
It will have to be attractive enough that it will be foolish for employees not 
to participate.

 Certainly I believe and hope the implementation of this kind of program in 
Ventura County will be successful in reducing air pollution and improving the 
environment. From what I know of these kinds of programs operating in other 
parts of California -- for example, in Los Angeles -- definite progress is 
being made. Many of these programs are relatively new, so there aren't a lot of 
statistics or hard facts available yet, but it seems to me that any reduction 
in vehicle usage would have a positive effect on air quality. As I understand 
it, the larger employers in eastern Ventura County will be the first ones to 
develop and implement plans. Here at First Interstate, we have been deeply 
involved with this issue for well over a year and a half. We have participated 
with other employers and county and city officials in discussing the rule and 
its implementation. We hosted a meeting to talk about planning in cooperation 
with the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, and a transportation management 
association is being formed in Simi Valley. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Yes. The Rule 210 program has great potential to improve air quality in 
Ventura County. However, it won't happen overnight. It is going to take several 
years for the rule to be fully implemented. We also expect it will take time 
for employers to reach the goals specified in the rule. This is a brand-new 
program, which represents our first attempt to regulate the use of the 
automobile, not just the emissions coming out of the tailpipe. Emissions from 
motor vehicles account for about half the air-quality problem in Ventura 
County. Although cars are far less polluting today than in the past, traffic 
volume has grown tremendously. While population is growing at approximately 2% 
per year, vehicle miles traveled are growing at 5% per year. If people want 
clean air, they have to realize that a change in their driving habits is an 
important part of the solution. 
</P>

<P>
Neil A. Moyer 
</P>
<P>
President, Environmental Coalition of Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
The county is fortunate that Rule 210 is patterned after the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District Regulation 15. Because that rule has been in effect 
for three years, a lot of very useful plans have been developed by various 
companies and industries. Many of these plans can be used by Ventura County 
firms to accelerate such programs as ride-sharing and van-pooling among their 
employees. As far as the county government is concerned, the program that the 
South Coast district has been using should be very successful with county 
employees. If the county pursues this program vigorously, the county should 
have a very successful program with its own employees. Also, because a number 
of consultants have emerged in this field because of Regulation 15, Ventura 
County firms should be able to use their services and develop successful 
programs for their own employees.

PARENTS OFFER TO FOOT BILL FOR NEW SCHOOL IN NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEWHALL SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUSTEES HEAR AN UNUSUAL PROPOSAL FROM A 
GROUP OF VALENCIA HOMEOWNERS WHO SUPPORT A TAX THAT WOULD COST THEM $250 TO 
$950 PER YEAR TO PAY FOR A NEW 600-STUDENT ELEMENTARY CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Acting at the urging of parents who offered to open their pocketbooks to pay 
for a neighborhood school, Newhall School District trustees on Tuesday night 
took the first step toward holding a special election to raise property taxes 
by $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was described by school officials as an unusual and perhaps 
unprecedented partnership between parents and school officials that could serve 
as a model for other school systems struggling to absorb skyrocketing 
enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is successful, perhaps other neighborhoods will want to try it," Supt. 
J. Michael McGrath said. The tax is unusual, he said, because it was proposed 
by taxpayers, not school officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night the Newhall trustees announced their intention to create 
boundaries for the special tax district. They must hold a public hearing in 
October before formally setting an election date, perhaps for February. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which needs approval from two-thirds of the voters to pass, would 
apply only to about 1,700 households in the Summit, an upscale Valencia housing 
development where homes typically command prices of $300,000 to more than 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
The assessments to pay off construction bonds would last for 25 years and would 
vary from $250 to $950 per year, depending on the size of the property, McGrath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would pay for the site and construction of a 600-student school near 
College of the Canyons. It would also pay for a foot bridge for students to 
cross Rockwell Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Assessment districts, typical devices to fund new schools, usually are proposed 
by developers or school officials. The nearby Sulphur Springs Union School 
District is asking voters to approve a bond measure in November and the William 
S. Hart Union High School District is considering a tax increase as well. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said the district's attorneys, considered experts in assessment 
districts statewide, have said they have never heard of parents calling for a 
property tax themselves. Parents even submitted petitions, with 300 signatures, 
asking the trustees to consider the tax election. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is the wish of the citizens," McGrath said at the meeting Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in the Summit proposed the tax after Newhall trustees redrew school 
attendance lines in October, 1988, to balance enrollments at the district's six 
crowded campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The new lines split children in the Summit between two schools, and parents 
bitterly complained that the trustees had divided a close-knit community. 
</P>
<P>
"This seemed to be one way to get all our kids back together again and do 
something for the whole community," Summit resident Doug Hansen said of the 
proposed tax. 
</P>
<P>
School officials and Summit parents predicted that some district residents will 
label the tax plan a snobbish instrument to keep their children from mingling 
with those from other neighborhoods. "There will be criticism that this will be 
elitist," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansen, who helped organize the proposal, said: "They have the 
misunderstanding that it's going to be a private school. But it's not; it's a 
public school." 
</P>
<P>
There are only about 200 schoolchildren in the Summit so the majority of the 
students would come from other parts of the district. 
</P>
<P>
"If we really wanted our own school, we'd start a private school," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax was proposed by a group of 50 parents who worked on the proposal with 
district officials for more than a year. Hansen said the parents collected 
$8,000 to help the district redraw legal maps needed to create the assessment 
district.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WARNINGS POSTED TO PROTECT RARE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PITTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warning signs have been posted at the mouth of the Ventura River to protect a 
small flock of least terns, an endangered bird temporarily in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The signs, warning that harassing the birds is a federal offense, were posted 
after passersby complained that people were riding bikes, throwing stones and 
flying kites in the Ventura River estuary where the adult least terns are 
teaching their young how to hunt for food, said Barbara Fosbrink, Ventura city 
parks department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The birds need to be left alone when they are in the training process because 
they are very vulnerable. "The birds are at a very sensitive stage when they 
are feeding," said Mark Capelli, a California Coastal Commission biologist. 
</P>
<P>
The adult least terns frequent the estuary for its warm, shallow waters and 
excellent food resources, but this is the first time they have brought their 
young with them, Fosbrink said. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are naturally restricted to Southern California's sandy beaches but 
their habitat is slowly diminishing. "There are fewer and fewer places for them 
to go. Most beach property has been developed and their feeding ground is 
either populated or polluted," Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The birds once numbered in the thousands, with nests from San Diego to San 
Francisco, but numbers dwindled to 300 pairs by the early 1970s. No figures on 
their current population were available. 
</P>
<P>
The flock of about 20 probably came from the Santa Clara River mouth west of 
Oxnard, where the birds normally nest. LAURA PITTER

MAN WHO FLED COURT RECAPTURED

<P>
A Ventura man who fled from Ventura County Municipal Court to avoid going to 
jail was caught by sheriff's deputies Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Paul James Buttorff, 26, was taken into custody about 7 p.m. at a residence on 
Banner Avenue in Ventura after the Ventura County Sheriff's Department received 
a tip that he was there, Sheriff's Lt. Paul Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Buttorff was appearing before Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III on two 
warrants for possession of marijuana and one warrant for violation of probation 
Tuesday when the escape occurred, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Michael Gullon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis remanded Buttorff to the custody of the Sheriff's Department, but rather 
than taking a seat in the courtroom and waiting to be taken to jail, Buttorff 
fled, Gullon said. 
</P>
<P>
Buttorff was later seen running in the northeast parking lot of the Ventura 
County Government Center. He got into a vehicle and left, Gullon said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis issued a bench warrant for Buttorff's arrest, Gullon said. CAROL WATSON

PROJECT AGAIN APPROVED FOR PARAMOUNT RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday rejected a request by 
environmentalists to reopen hearings on the controversial Paramount Ranch 
housing development in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the supervisors unanimously re-approved the 150-house project, which 
the Sierra Club and the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation had failed to stop 
through a recent lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were required to vote again on the luxury residential 
development in Agoura because of a legal technicality stemming from the court 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The board originally approved the project in March, 1989, but that vote was 
challenged by the lawsuit's plaintiffs, who alleged that the environmental 
report was biased because the developer, not the county, hired the author. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the hilly, oak-dotted property has been of keen interest to 
environmentalists because park agencies have sought to buy the land for years. 
The property was the former home of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy letter to the board, Carlyle W. Hall Jr., the Sierra Club's 
attorney, urged the board to require a new environmental impact report and to 
reopen the project to public debate. Hall called the environmental report 
"fundamentally flawed" and charged that a financial analysis of the project was 
falsified to win the board's original approval. 
</P>
<P>
Hall also contended that the project should be re-examined in light of an 
environmental victory in another recent court case challenging the board's 
approval of a housing development. A Superior Court judge ruled that the county 
erred when it did not require an independent consultant to write the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
In the Paramount Ranch case, the developer was allowed to hire his own 
consultant, which Hall contended created an "irreconcilable conflict of 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Gerald F. Crump, chief assistant county counsel, told the 
supervisors it was not necessary to reopen the Paramount Ranch case. He said 
the trial judge had adequately addressed the plaintiffs' complaints.

SITTER WILL STAND TRIAL IN INFANT'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE DECIDES THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO TRY DEBRA SUZANNE 
CUMMINGS ON A CHARGE SHE KILLED A 9-MONTH-OLD BABY LEFT IN HER CARE. 
</P>

<P>
A 32-year-old Reseda baby-sitter and PTA president was ordered Tuesday to stand 
trial on a charge she killed a 9-month-old baby who died of a head injury he 
suffered while under her care. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Judge Leslie Ann Dunn 
ruled that the prosecution had presented sufficient evidence to hold Debra 
Suzanne Cummings for trial on one count of murder in the June 16 death of Kevin 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, 32, president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School in 
Reseda, is also under investigation in the death of another baby, who died of 
an apparent seizure while in her care, but has not been charged in that case. 
Cummings sat quietly in court as Kevin's mother, Toni Majoy-Young, testified 
that Cummings called her at work on June 15 and told her to come pick up her 
son. Majoy-Young said Cummings told her the baby had fallen and bumped his head 
on a coffee table in her house. 
</P>
<P>
Majoy-Young tearfully testified that her baby died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Medical Examiner Solomon Riley, who conducted an autopsy on Kevin, 
testified under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch that Kevin died 
from multiple blunt force trauma injuries to the head and also suffered an 
injury to the inside of the abdominal cavity. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Fisch if the baby could have suffered the fatal injuries in a fall 
against a coffee table, Riley responded it "would require a fall from a 
tremendous height -- two stories, or maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, who is free on $100,000 bail, sat quietly during the court 
proceedings, which were attended by nearly two dozen of her relatives and 
friends. Her attorney, Joe Ingber, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings is also under investigation in connection with the death last March of 
14-month-old Matthew Cooley of Reseda, who lost consciousness while at a park 
with Cummings. His doctor listed the cause of death as an apparent seizure, but 
the boy's mother told police she became suspicious because the boy had seizures 
only in Cummings' presence. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office, which investigates all unnatural deaths in the county, 
did not perform an autopsy because the boy's doctor listed the cause of death 
as a seizure due to natural causes, prosecutors said. A private autopsy was 
performed by hospital officials, but the results were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Fisch said the district attorney's office has asked the coroner's office to 
examine tissue samples from the Cooley baby's brain in a further search for 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has received permission from the boy's mother to 
exhume his body if necessary, Fisch added.

MUGGING VICTIM HELPS FIND SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bruised but alert victim of a downtown San Diego mugging teamed with a 
police officer Tuesday afternoon to locate the suspects in the assault, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Davis, 42, who police say works part time downtown, was walking in the 
900 block of E Street when two men grabbed, kicked and cut him, taking his 
pocket change and wallet. 
</P>
<P>
After being called to the scene, San Diego Police Officer Larry Triplett Jr. 
helped Davis into his squad car. They drove around the area for 30 minutes 
looking for the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Triplett arrested Javier Flores Camaney, 24, and Martin Gonzalez Paze, 20, at 
10th Avenue and B Street. Both men are undocumented immigrants, police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked into County Jail at 4 p.m. on suspicion of armed robbery and 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was robbed of 75 cents, Robinson said.

TRIAL SET FOR SON OF EVANGELIST CERULLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The son of San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo will go on trial Oct. 12 on 
charges that he tried to steal an air-conditioning unit from a store. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, the minister's youngest son, pleaded not guilty to 
burglary and attempted grand theft charges Tuesday in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo almost had a warrant issued for his arrest Tuesday, as he didn't appear 
on time at his scheduled arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor asked Judge David Gill to issue a warrant, but the minister's son 
arrived about 45 minutes later. Gill told Cerullo to appear in court on time 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, who is free on $4,000 bail, declined to say who bailed him out of jail 
after his July 29 arrest or to comment about the case to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Morris Cerullo, who is planning to buy the PTL ministry left by Jim 
and Tammy Bakker, said earlier this month that he was not going to post bail 
for his son. 
</P>
<P>
Neither parent appeared at the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo is accused of posing as a Home Depot employee at the Sports Arena store 
and trying to leave with an air-conditioning unit without paying for it.

STATE'S BOOM MOST DRAMATIC IN RURAL AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS, THE GREATEST GROWTH DURING THE 1980S OCCURRED IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's recent growth has been most remarkable not in San Diego or Los 
Angeles but in towns such as Palmdale and Tracy, which have exploded into 
cities -- and in dots on the map like Adelanto and Cathedral City, which are 
now good-sized towns. 
</P>
<P>
Cathedral City, on the edge of Palm Springs in the southern desert, wins the 
prize for the most rapid evolution. In 1980, the census found only 4,130 people 
there. The latest count, released in preliminary form this week, found 28,959 
-- a jump of 601% in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Existing subdivisions that were absorbed when the city was incorporated in 1981 
explain part ofthe growth. A building boom has filled in what were acres of 
vacant desert, much of it falling to development just this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real growth," City Manager Joe Painter said Tuesday. "We actually thought 
we were closer to 31-32,000." 
</P>
<P>
In lesser numbers, the phenomenon has been seen elsewhere in the Southern 
California desert and up the center of the state, in the San Joaquin Valley and 
along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Palmdale, a surge of young home buyers has transformed the old 
German Lutheran settlement into a major desert city. The new census figures 
show that Palmdale's population jumped 432% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
People willing to live with extreme summer heat and occasional winter snow have 
also swelled Mojave Desert towns such as Hesperia, Apple Valley and Adelanto, 
which all tripled in population since 1980. California City more than doubled 
in size and Lancaster, the desert's biggest city, nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of small towns such as Ripon and Patterson, which more than 
doubled, communities in Northern California grew more slowly than towns in the 
southern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Among larger towns in the north, Tracy has undergone the biggest change. 
Refugees from high home prices in the San Francisco Bay Area have turned Tracy 
into the first Bay Area suburb to be located on the floor of the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hand, community development director in Tracy, said Tuesday that the 
city's location, surrounded by major interstate highways, has made it 
convenient for commuters to San Jose, Livermore and the East Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have real good freeway access," Hand said, noting that the highways "form a 
triangle around the city." Tracy has grown by 75% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau said growth in excess of 50% was common in towns and cities 
up and down the Central Valley. Bakersfield's population swelled this decade by 
62.6% and Fresno, the second largest valley city behind Sacramento, grew by 
60.8%. Ceres, a town of 25,900 in Stanislaus County, grew by 95.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The census figures released Monday show that, by region, Southern California 
remains the most populous chunk of the state with 57.6% of the people. Despite 
having the fastest-growing cities and towns, Southern California did not 
significantly increase its share of the state's population, which in 1980 was 
56.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there was a slight shift in the population balance toward the San 
Joaquin Valley area -- which has 9.2% of the state's residents -- and the 
Sierra Nevada foothill and mountain counties. The Sierra area has only 1.9% of 
the people, but it grew by 43.5% and towns along the mountains are undergoing 
dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, those inland areas -- along with fast-growing Southern California 
deserts -- are now adding people faster than the coast. From San Diego north to 
tiny Del Norte, 59.8% of the population is in counties that touch the Pacific. 
A decade ago, the coastal share was 62.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Bay Area also is losing ground. The Bay Area's population 
nudged higher, but more slowly than the inland areas or Southern California, 
and its share of the state's population dropped from 21.8% to 20.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Within Southern California, the inland shift is more pronounced and it is 
diminishing the importance of Los Angeles. A decade ago, Los Angeles County was 
home to 55.5% of the region's people. Now, its share has shrunk to 51.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The share of Californians who call the city of Los Angeles home also continued 
its steady decline. In 1950, more than 18% of the state resided within Los 
Angeles. This year, Los Angeles contains 11.6%.

3.2 QUAKE SHAKES JULIAN RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small earthquake centered 42 miles northeast of San Diego jolted Julian 
residents Tuesday night, Caltech spokeswoman Heidi Aspaturian said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries or damage stemming from the 3.2-magnitude earthquake had been 
reported. The Sheriff's Department had received two calls about the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Garfield, managing editor of the Julian News, was in his office when the 
quake struck at 8:21 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty much a single shake, just one boom," Garfield said. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department spokesman said there were no reports of aftershocks.

VOLUNTEER DEEJAYS KEEP JAZZ ON AIR IN S.D.;

RADIO: TINY CITY COLLEGE STATION IS DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE THAT SAN DIEGANS 
CAN KEEP TUNED IN TO THE SOUNDS OF JAZZ.

A saxophone wailed from somewhere down a deserted hallway. The heart-rending 
sound came through a far-off open door. In a tiny booth equipped with CD 
players, turntables, a microphone, assorted electronic equipment and an array 
of knobs and buttons, KSDS disc jockey Ron Galon worked jazz magic. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in shorts and a tank top on a Saturday night, Galon delivered set after 
set of jazz, mixing longtime jazz players such as Pat Metheny with 
lesser-knowns such as Bob Berg. Galon has been host of a three-hour show on 
Saturday nights since 1985. During the day, he works as a communications 
technician for AT&amp;T, but he thrives on his unpaid KSDS nights. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Joe Rand took Galon's place at 9. He sells hair-care products for a 
living, but this Saturday night, he was doing what he loves more than anything: 
filling in for regular host "T" on the station's 9-to-midnight blues show. 
While a Lightnin' Hopkins tune wound down, Rand kept busy, flipping the next CD 
into a player, pushing a public service announcement cartridge into a tape 
machine, answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
Galon and Rand are but two of 60 unsalaried but professional-sounding disc 
jockeys who play music from 6 a.m. to midnight five days a week, and until 2 
a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. They choose from among 7,000 records and 2,000 CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Like the old underground rock 'n' roll radio stations of the 1960s, KSDS, on 
the campus of San Diego City College, places the emphasis on music. Long, 
artfully composed sets of songs reflect each disc jockey's personal tastes, not 
the results of market research. 
</P>
<P>
To purists, KSDS is the only true jazz station in town, the only consistent 
outlet for the music whose legends include Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, 
Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Miles Davis, Oscar Peterson and many others. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no formal surveys as to the size of its audience, but General 
Manager Jim Dark, also dean of the college's Radio/Television Department, 
estimated that 40,000 people tune in during the course of an average week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a rule of thumb that you multiply your weekly inquiries by 100 to 
estimate your audience," said Dark, who guessed that the station receives 
roughly 400 letters and phone calls per week. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast with other stations, KSDS's 841-watt signal (88.1 FM) is barely a 
blip. Light jazz-pop station KIFM (98.1), for example, boasts 28,000 watts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our signal probably takes us south to Chula Vista, midway through El Cajon and 
north through Del Mar," Dark said. Maybe, but the sound can be spotty, 
especially in a moving vehicle. For at least a decade, each year's community 
college budgeting process brings talk of a new transmitter and an upgrade to 
2,000 watts, but so far it hasn't happened. Dark said he hopes for the 
resolution of some technical obstacles, but he couldn't say when. 
</P>
<P>
KSDS radio is available to subscribers of several local cable television 
systems, including Cox, Southwestern, Times Mirror/Dimension and American 
Cablevision/Televents. Cox alone presents a potential audience of 299,000, but 
KSDS has barely scratched the surface. Few cable subscribers know that by 
hooking up their FM receivers to the cable, they can get better reception and 
more stations, including KSDS. Cox charges $15 for FM connection and $3.95 per 
month for radio service. 
</P>
<P>
Although the matters of power and reach are in limbo, the station's sound 
continues to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
Several shows each week include interviews with a variety of local and 
internationally known jazz performers. Art Blakey, Max Roach and Tony Williams 
have all appeared on San Diego drummer Barry Farrar's "Percussive Profiles" 
program, which airs Mondays from 3 to 6 p.m. Stan Getz and Carmen McRae chatted 
with KSDS jock Tony D. earlier this year, and Chick Corea was on Tom McManus' 
"Piano Perspectives in April. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime on-air personalities like Scott Harrison ("Friday Night Countdown"), 
Pat Allen ("Jazz Live," Tuesday nights), Miff Mole ("Free Time," Thursday 
nights) and "T" ("Every Shade of Blue," Saturday nights, and Wednesday night 
jazz) are constantly supplemented with new programming and talent. 
</P>
<P>
Shows added during the past year include "Instrumental Women," with Janine 
Harty Wednesdays at 2 p.m., "Le Jazz Club," every other Sunday night at 7 
(tapes of European club dates), and, on Sunday afternoons at 1, McManus' piano 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, veteran jazz aficionado Rod Page began a Sunday afternoon show from 
4 to 6. Page drove a bus for Duke Ellington, was master of ceremonies for Stan 
Kenton and had a jazz show on KFMX, a jazz station in La Jolla during the late 
'50s and early '60s. He regales listeners with first-hand stories about the 
greats of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done is add specialty shows, but within the jazz mainstream," said 
Tony Sisti, the station's program director. "We're a music intensive station. 
All we're trying to do is preserve an American art form that is dwindling." 
</P>
<P>
KSDS went on the air in 1951 but didn't go all-jazz until 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time we switched, a particular core of students was very interested in 
jazz," said Hope Shaw, the station's manager, also an instructor of 
radio-television. "We felt we were an urban college, and that a lot of our 
constituency was very interested in the roots of jazz, or might be, and there 
was no jazz station in the community. We didn't want to be simply a college 
station that was so eclectic we didn't serve anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Since the early years, the station has grown in many ways. An annual budget of 
about $54,000 comes from the community college district. KSDS is also exploring 
underwriting, the same kind of financing that helps keep public television and 
radio afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Disc jockeys and management will soon have a much better idea of who their 
listeners are and what they want. 
</P>
<P>
"We know absolutely nothing right now," Sisti said. Last week, 1,500 surveys 
went out to listeners, and Sisti hopes 5,000 more will call in to request the 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Sisti is counting on a crew of rising young mainstream jazz 
players to help KSDS carry the jazz flame. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have right now is a lot of young lions coming up, trying to preserve 
the tradition. I'm talking about trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Marlon Jordan, the 
organist Joey DeFrancesco. It's a long list. These are people who are keeping 
jazz alive. They don't get played on commercial radio."

WASHINGTON WEAVES MAGIC WITHOUT MIRRORS

Saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. was in top form during the first of two sets 
Monday night at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. Backed by an airtight, 
six-piece band, Washington delivered exactly what the audience wanted: a mix of 
his older, funkier jazz along with his newer, glossier FM radio hits. And he 
dedicated the set to blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who died in a 
helicopter crash Monday in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna jam instead of grieving," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with equal force and dexterity on baritone, tenor, alto and soprano 
saxes, Washington, 46, proved that he is still head and shoulders above most of 
his younger competition. Unlike some of today's commercial jazzmen, who play it 
safe with syrupy melodies unbroken by improvisations, Washington is a 
legitimate innovator who brings fresh inventions to even the simplest, funkiest 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was among the earliest jazzmen to go electric and reach a wider 
audience. He was also among the best, and the 1970s ballads and funk-jazz 
numbers that first brought him commercial success hold up extremely well next 
to the light popular jazz produced by other artists today. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-song set provided a capsule history of his career, which took off with the 
1975 hit album "Mr. Magic." The difference between then and now was clear when 
Washington moved, early in the set, from the '70s song "Hydra" to "Nice and 
Easy," from the 1989 "Time Out of Mind" album. "Hydra" featured a no-nonsense 
funky back beat and plenty of room for improvisations. "Nice and Easy" was a 
smoother blend of Washington's sax and synthesized keyboard parts -- provided 
by Bill Jolly and Curtis Dowd -- layered over a simmering Latin beat. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the evening's finest moments came with Washington on soprano sax. 
Snake-charming, high-end melodies evoked the spirit of the late John Coltrane. 
Although Washington amplifies all of his saxes, he uses electricity as a tool, 
not a gimmick. His musical ideas and the earthy tone of his horns always take 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
His playing runs the gamut from unfettered screeching and squealing, which 
would sound like avant-garde New York loft jazz if not tethered by his band's 
funky beat, to simpler patterns repeated for their rhythmic effect. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights included the slow, romantic side of Washington on "Take Me 
There," guitarist Richard Lee's sensuous Wes Montgomery-like solo on "Blues for 
D.P.," and a tight blend of Washington's tenor sax with electronically enhanced 
background vocals on "Feelings." 
</P>
<P>
A medley near the end of the set mixed some of Washington's best originals with 
his covers of popular favorites, most notably singer Marvin Gaye's "Inner City 
Blues" and "Mercy Mercy Me." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd's standing ovation brought the group out for an encore. Washington 
chose "Mr. Magic," the title track from the album that gave him his nickname. 
Bassist Lanar Brantley supplied a rollicking solo that moved freely beyond the 
boundaries of the song to quote bass lines from Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" 
and the current rap hit by M.C. Hammer, "U Can't Touch This."

BISHOP RIDES A MUSICAL ROLLER COASTER INTO S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
When Stephen Bishop performs Saturday night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, it 
will be the expatriate San Diego singer-songwriter's first hometown appearance 
in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I haven't played here for so long," Bishop said from his home 
in Los Angeles, where he has lived since 1969. "Things happen; you get caught 
up doing stuff, and I'm pretty set in Los Angeles right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only been touring a little bit, here and there, off and on, for the last 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
Had Bishop's comeback album, last fall's "Bowling In Paris," been a hit, things 
would be different, he said. He'd be touring as extensively as he did in the 
late 1970s and early '80s, his commercial heyday. 
</P>
<P>
But the album, his first in nine years, flopped, and Bishop has since left 
Atlantic Records. His recording career is currently in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"The label just didn't have a firm commitment to it (the album)," he said. 
"Heavy metal is their forte, and they didn't really know what to do with me. 
I'm a pop songwriter, and doing what I do, more and more, has become a 
prehistoric thing, with everybody into rap or dance-pop or heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird time for music right now, but I'm not the type of person with 
sour grapes -- and besides, there are too many other things to be involved in." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Earlier this year, Bishop was invited by Phil Collins, who had produced 
much of "Bowling in Paris," to contribute background vocals to one of the songs 
on his latest solo album, "But Seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"I did all the background vocals and double tracks on 'Do You Remember,' and 
then when he came into town a few weeks ago, he asked me to sing with him at 
the (Inglewood) Forum," Bishop said. "That was fun. He introduced me as 'one of 
the best songwriters in America.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bishop also spent a lot of time building a recording studio in his Hollywood 
Hills home and went on a two-week tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
And he's been writing songs like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I do want to make another record, but, more than anything else, I want to keep 
on writing," Bishop said. "I just finished writing a song with Pete Rafelson 
for Paula Abdul, which we slaved over, and it looks good that Donna Summer 
might be doing one of my songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also doing this thing with 'thirtysomething.' They're interested in me 
doing some stuff for the show. And I've also got some movies I'm interested in 
scoring. A lot of people are looking for songs, and that keeps me busy." 
</P>
<P>
Songwriting is not only what he likes to do best, it is where the money is. 
Bishop continues to receive royalty checks for his four self-penned Top 40 
hits, 1977's "Save It for a Rainy Day" and "On and On," 1978's "Everybody Needs 
Love," and 1983's "It Might Be You" (from the movie, "Tootsie"). 
</P>
<P>
He made a lot of money from "Separate Lives," the Oscar-nominated theme from 
the 1985 film, "White Nights," that was recorded by Collins and Marilyn Martin. 
And he expects to make even more come October, when a live version of the song 
appears on Collins' upcoming greatest hits album. 
</P>
<P>
So even though he's still scouting around for a new record deal, Bishop said, 
he's not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through this before," he said. "It's just the way it is; things roll 
around and go up and down. It's a big musical roller coaster, and a lot of 
people have been on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad I'm still in the amusement park." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The second annual Marlboro Music Military Tour, featuring Poco, 
.38 Special, and last year's "talent roundup" winner, Angel Train, touches down

10-date tour of military bases around the country ends two days later at Pearl 
Harbor. The show starts at 4 p.m. and tickets are $5 in advance, $8 the day of 
the show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two quasi-celebs have been tapped to headline a pair of upcoming benefit 
concerts: Juice Newton at Saturday's outdoor fund-raiser for the American 
Cancer Society on the Rancho Santa Fe Polo Grounds, and Rita Coolidge at the 
third annual "Bring On the Night" benefit for the AIDS Assistance Fund, Sept. 9

</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday for Boom Crash Opera's Sept. 22 concert

Shelter Island; America, Thursday at the Bacchanal; the Moody Blues, Friday at 
San Diego State University's Open Air Theater; and Ronnie Montrose, Friday at

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WEST COVINA CITY MANAGER TO RETIRE AFTER 14 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Covina city manager Herman R. Fast announced he is retiring Sept. 30, 
stepping down from a job he has held for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fast, 63, made the announcement at a meeting this week of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
He began working for the city in 1962 as a planning commissioner, and became 
assistant city manager before leaving West Covina in 1972 to become city 
manager of Chino. In 1976, Fast returned to West Covina as city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to name an interim city manager Sept. 10, said Steve 
Wylie, assistant to the city manager. According to the city code, the council 
has until Dec. 1 to replace Fast.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PET FOOD CANNERY TO BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Commission has approved demolition of the Heinz pet food 
cannery in Wilmington amid complaints that the building's most historically 
valued equipment was not passed on to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council abandoned plans to designate the 
cannery, on South Fries Avenue, as a historical and cultural monument. Instead, 
at the urging of Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, city lawmakers called for the 
port to provide Wilmington with a new waterfront museum or plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents had complained that some of the cannery's equipment was sold 
to a salvage company before residents were able to tour the plant.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 42 MONTHS IN JEWISH CHARITY SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man was sentenced Tuesday to 42 months in jail for running a 
charity scam in which he sold tickets to a nonexistent event under the guise of 
raising funds for the Jewish Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ray Lonberger, 39, who ran the scam using the alias Charles Freed, was 
convicted of 11 misdemeanor charges last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was his second conviction in two years stemming from illegal solicitation of 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
During the monthlong trial, 34 prosecution witnesses testified that Lonberger 
raised funds from a rented office in the Fairfax district for a bogus 
theatrical production, "The Dance of Esther." Witnesses said Lonberger hired 
unsuspecting sales people to sell $50 tickets for the fake event and offered 
free advertising in a nonexistent magazine to businesses that bought tickets.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE DAY LATINOS LOST A VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
On Saturday, I stopped at the Silver Dollar, the East Los Angeles bar where 
journalist Ruben Salazar died 20 years ago today. 
</P>
<P>
I'd been walking down Whittier Boulevard that morning. My aim was to meet up 
with the marchers commemorating the day when Salazar and two others were killed 
during a Latino demonstration against the Vietnam War. By chance, I passed the 
Silver Dollar and went in for a beer. 
</P>
<P>
A few men drank from long-necked bottles of Bud. Two pool tables filled the 
center of the dark room, just as they did on the day of Salazar's death. A 
poster with Salazar's picture was on a wall, advertising the play about him, 
"The Silver Dollar," performed at the bar evenings and some afternoons by 
Teatro Urbano. A taped X on a bar stool marked the place where Salazar sat when 
he was hit in the head by a tear-gas missile fired by a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
I'd known him slightly. A friend of his sat next to me when I was a beginning 
reporter at the Oakland Tribune and regaled me with stories of Salazar, then a 
young star at the old San Francisco News. I finally met him in 1970 when I got 
a job at The Times, where he'd reported from Los Angeles, Vietnam, Mexico and 
the Dominican Republic. That year Salazar left The Times news staff to become 
news director for Spanish-language television station KMEX, and, at the same 
time, a columnist for the paper. I remember being pleased that someone from our 
rough Bay Area newspaper world had gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar was covering the anti-war demonstration for KMEX the day he was killed. 
The event had begun peacefully enough with a march of about 20,000, but a 
disturbance at a liquor store brought in sheriff's deputies. They scattered a 
crowd in a park with clubs and tear gas. As the demonstration turned into a 
rebellion, fires broke out on Whittier Boulevard. Salazar's cameraman, Octavio 
Gomez, told me that Salazar wanted to check out a fire at the Mode O'Day 
apparel store. He looked at the fire, then ducked into the Silver Dollar for a 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
In the confusion outside, deputies said they were told that a man with a gun 
was in the bar. They fired tear gas inside, and one of the missiles struck 
Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
The county said the deputies were following proper procedures, and Salazar's 
death was purely accidental. But many in the barrio believe the tear-gassing of 
the Silver Dollar was a violent overreaction by racist deputies. Some say 
Salazar was assassinated. The answer may never be known. Four members of a 
coroner's jury ruled that Salazar died "at the hands of another" and the other 
three jurors said his death was an accident. The county paid a $700,000 
settlement to Salazar's widow and children. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in the months before his death, Salazar had warned in his Times 
column there might be violence in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
With the freedom of a column, he'd become a powerful and disturbing voice in 
Los Angeles journalism. He was an intellectual leader to the increasingly 
politically aware and militant barrio and a gutsy advocate for the Latino 
community. The Times -- and the town -- had never had anyone like him. 
</P>
<P>
To Latinos, he spoke of the need for political organization. "Ah, Chicanos," he 
wrote in disgust when too many Latino candidates split the vote, costing a 
promising young Chicano an election. And he punctured the Anglos' complacent 
image of Mexican-Americans being content with their poverty. He warned them 
that the barrio was in rebellion against brutal law enforcement, the 
dismantling of late '60s social programs and the Vietnam War, which was 
claiming the lives of a disproportionate number of Latinos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"This mood," Salazar wrote on June 19, 1970, "is not being helped by our 
political and law-and-order leaders who are trying to discredit militants in 
the barrio as subversive or criminal." 
</P>
<P>
If Salazar were alive, the cynical old newsman in him wouldn't be surprised to 
learn that his successors are still writing about the same problems. The 
county, for example, is still paying big settlements to victims of sheriff's 
deputies' rough tactics in East L.A. But he would undoubtedly be pleased that 
there are many more Latino elected officials, doctors, lawyers, merchants, 
teachers and reporters than in his day. 
</P>
<P>
Most satisfying to him, I guess, would be the way his work continues through 
others. It does in the performances of "The Silver Dollar" and in another play 
about Salazar, "August 29," at the Los Angeles Theater Center. And certainly 
the inspiration of Salazar lives every day, throughout the country, in the work 
of the Latino reporters and editors who have followed him.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCOUT INJURED, 6 ACRES BURNED IN BRUSH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Explorer Scout was injured and six acres of brush burned in a fire believed 
to have been deliberately set Tuesday on a Glendale hillside less than two 
miles from the site of a disastrous fire that destroyed or damaged 66 homes in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 1:20 p.m. near Menlo Drive and Vista del Mar in an 
area of expensive hillside homes, said Glendale Fire Capt. Steve Wood. 
</P>
<P>
No homes were damaged, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters four hours to quell the blaze. The unidentified Explorer 
Scout, who was working in a fire training program, was treated for heat 
exhaustion and released from Verdugo Hills Hospital. The cause of the fire was 
listed as suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second brush fire in two weeks in Glendale. A faulty power 
transformer was blamed for a 7-acre greater-alarm fire Aug. 20 in the Rossmoyne 
section of the hills. The roof of one house was slightly damaged in that blaze.

COUNCIL MOVES TO SUBPOENA COUNTY'S MALATHION TEST DATA; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC HEALTH: URINE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM 70 PEOPLE IN SPRAYING ZONES IN 
MAY. WACHS ALLEGES THAT OFFICIAL HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 
THE STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday issued a subpoena to force a county 
health official to produce all documents pertaining to urine samples taken in 
May from 70 people in Los Angeles and Orange counties who said they became ill 
immediately after their neighborhoods were sprayed with the pesticide 
malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Results of those tests are due in a month and are expected to provide the first 
precise measurements of how much malathion has been absorbed by people in the 
spray zones, state and county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of the urine tests arose Tuesday when Los Angeles City Councilman 
Joel Wachs made a motion to try to compel Dr. Paul Papanek, chief of the county 
Health Department's toxics epidemiology program, to hand over documents about 
the study, as well as all "vital information regarding the health effects of 
malathion spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Papanek called Wachs "irresponsibly ignorant" and vehemently denied that his 
office has withheld any information. He said there is no need for a subpoena to 
read the background documents, which he said have been available for any member 
of the council to read. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 11 to 1 to issue the subpoena, but it also decided to give 
Papanek a final opportunity to turn over the information voluntarily -- and 
under oath -- before enforcing the subpoena. Wachs wants Papanek to appear, 
with the documents, before the council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee, 
which is conducting its own study of the effects of malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs alleged that Papanek has refused to reveal information about the study, 
believed to be the first -- and only -- urine testing done during the recent 
campaign to battle the Mediterranean fruit fly with regular doses of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Though the campaign has virtually ended -- the last spraying in Los Angeles 
County took place July 23 -- there is continued concern among some residents 
and government officials over the health effects of repeated exposure to the 
pesticide. Wachs said that more than 2 million pounds of malathion-laced bait 
has been sprayed over Southern California since January. 
</P>
<P>
Papanek said the 70 residents who submitted urine samples were selected from 
more than 1,800 who have called health authorities to complain about symptoms 
ranging from headaches to rashes that they say cropped up within hours of the 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
He said public health nurses were sent to collect the samples, which were 
frozen and shipped to the California Department of Health Service's Hazardous 
Materials Laboratory in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
A state research scientist at the laboratory said a "lack of resources" kept 
health officials from taking more samples. 
</P>
<P>
The samples were taken in May and some city officials have questioned why no 
results have been released 90 days later. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to get this information for the longest time but we can't 
get it voluntarily," Wachs said in an interview. "There are a lot of questions 
to ask about this: Who did they sample? How did they do it? When did they do 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
Health officials involved in testing the urine samples said the delay was 
unavoidable. Before analyzing the samples, research scientists had to invent a 
method of detecting evidence of malathion exposure in human urine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done this before," said William Draper, a research scientist at the lab. 
"That is, we've taken samples and not known what the heck we were going to do 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Papanek said the urine testing is being done to support the 
state's contention that the amount of malathion absorbed by the body after 
spraying does not pose a health threat.

BIGGER SITE APPROVED FOR CRAFT MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: CITY COUNCIL OKS RELOCATION TO EXPANDED SPACE IN A NEW MIXED-USE 
TOWER ON THE MIRACLE MILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a Miracle Mile 
development that would move the Craft and Folk Arts Museum into a proposed 
22-story building shared with shops and about 60 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The $47-million project, at Wilshire Boulevard and Curson Avenue, will provide 
about 57,000 square feet to the multicultural museum, which now operates out of 
temporary quarters in the May Co. department store on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley hailed the project as an "innovative approach" to mixed-use 
development, which he has strongly advocated. Bill Chandler, the mayor's press 
secretary, said Bradley "feels it is an excellent mixed-use project and that 
the public would benefit from the (expanded) museum." 
</P>
<P>
The Miracle Mile tower is to be designed and built by the Ratkovich Co. 
Ratkovich officials expect to begin construction in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials said last year that the project would offer them much 
additional space in which they plan to establish an education department, a 
library, a storage and conservation area and a theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Craft and Folk Arts Museum, known for its exhibits of hand-crafted objects, 
has had a somewhat peripatetic history. Before taking up residence at the May 
Co. last year, the museum spent more than 30 years on the first and third 
floors of a combined restaurant and art gallery on Wilshire Boulevard, across 
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the museum often fueled their stroll through the exhibits by dining 
at the Egg and the Eye, the upstairs restaurant whose name served both itself 
and the gallery until the latter was rechristened the Craft and Folk Arts 
Museum in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, the museum closed at that site and moved to its present 
location. The May Co. provided the 9,000-square-foot space, rent free. 
</P>
<P>
The council has recently been encouraging developers to design mixed-use 
projects in order to reduce traffic and smog.

YOUTH AVOIDED GANGS, BUT CATCHES FATAL BULLET ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emiliano Landa's friends thought he was joking, popping firecrackers and acting 
silly. They figured the 12-year-old was just feigning an injury when he ditched 
his bike Monday evening and, clutching his chest, dashed to his house across 
Hayford Street in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
After Landa collapsed on his lawn, his friends said Tuesday, they knew it was 
no prank. 
</P>
<P>
Landa was dead on arrival at nearby Pioneer Hospital, the victim of a bullet 
fired into his chest from a car cruising the 11900 block of Hayford Avenue. He 
had been sitting on his bike, chatting with friends, said a spokesman for the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We had seen the car go by and we heard the noise," said Norwalk resident Lucy 
Pinado, 14, who was standing near Landa when he was shot. "But we thought it 
was just firecrackers. We didn't see no blood. We didn't know what was going 
on. We just thought he was playing around." 
</P>
<P>
Landa was the fourth Los Angeles County youth hit by gunfire Monday. Two 
teen-age boys and a 12-year-old girl were wounded, the girl critically, in an 
unrelated shooting Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors said that Landa had steered clear of the gang activity that 
plagues the area, police said Tuesday that the gunman may have had gang ties. 
Investigators said they have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the neighborhood said gangs have been feuding in the area for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"You see it going on all around," said Javier Chavez, a 17-year-old friend of 
Landa's family. "But you never figure it would happen to somebody who has 
nothing to do with gangs. He wasn't doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Landa's sister, Gloria, said her parents had enrolled the 12-year-old in a 
nearby private school a few years ago to keep him far away from gang life. 
</P>
<P>
At first, she said, he struggled at the new school. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting Cs and Ds at first," said Gloria, 17, talking between sobs as 
she stood outside the family's well-kept corner home. "But then I talked to him 
and told him, 'Nin -- we called him Nin -- you have to get good grades like me. 
You can do it.' He started doing really good after that. He started bringing 
home Bs and As. He really liked his reading classes." 
</P>
<P>
When Landa was around the house, he would spend hours playing Nintendo video 
games by himself and with friends. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Landa's life was untouched by the gang violence around him 
-- although rumbles and shootings were common in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what was happening," said Gloria, "but he never wanted to get involved 
in that type of thing. We would watch what was happening on the news, and he 
knew he didn't want to be in a gang. He tried not to create problems for our 
mom." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid gangs, Landa hung out with other youths in the neighborhood who shared 
his disdain for crime and gunplay. His friends said they had been eating near 
the curb when the gunfire started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just got back from a restaurant up the street," said Tim Huerta. "He 
was sitting on his bike, and we were all talking. Not really talking about 
anything, you know, just talking. That's when the car came by, and we heard the 
popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we didn't think it was about anything."

A LOSS, QUESTIONS FOR PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padre chairman, was surveying the scene Tuesday night from the 
first row behind the Padre dugout. Jack McKeon, vice president/baseball 
operations, was viewing from the club box on the mezzanine level. Manager Greg 
Riddoch was watching from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Three different job descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Three different vantage points. 
</P>
<P>
Three different baseball backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
And each came away with the same opinion Tuesday night after the Padres' 4-0 
loss to the New York Mets in front of a crowd of 32,744 at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres ever are going to find themselves in the position of the Mets -- 
winning a World Series championship in 1986, a division title in 1988, and in 
the thick of a pennant race this season -- they are going to have to be some 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
One skimpy comparison study Monday night let the Padre hierarchy recognize 
everything they need to know why the Mets (71-55) are the ones who have crept 
to within two games of the division-leading Pittsburgh Pirates, and the Padres 
(60-67) are the ones buried in fourth place, counting the days to the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, we've formed some opinions," Riddoch said, "but by the end of the 
year, we'll have some definitive answers." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, McKeon and Riddoch met before Monday's game to discuss the Padres' 
future and the direction they want to take for 1991. Their needs are many, to 
be sure, but they have established their priorities: 
</P>
<P>
Before they open spring-training camp in Yuma, Ariz., the Padres have decided 
they want to trade for a starting shortstop, find a regular third baseman and 
come up with a bona fide fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
It's still unknown just how they plan to go about fulfilling their needs, but 
after watching Monday's game, the Padre hierarchy reaffirmed their belief in 
just how those positions can make such a difference: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Mets have Howard Johnson (.244, 19 homers and 72 RBIs) playing 
shortstop, filling in valiantly for injured Kevin Elster. The Padres have Garry 
Templeton (.251, eight homers and 45 RBIs), who is playing with a bad knee and 
injured rib cage muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have Gregg Jefferies (.295, 13 homers, 60 RBIs) playing third base. 
The Padres have Mike Pagliarulo (.245, three homers, 28 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
The Mets opened the season with David Cone (10-7, 3.42 ERA) as their fifth 
starter. He's the guy who pitched a five-hit shutout Monday against the Padres. 
The Padres' fifth starter is Calvin Schiraldi (3-7, 4.15), the same guy who 
lasted just four innings Monday, being pummeled for four runs and five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ah yes, those wondrous differences . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I still think the whole key to the Mets is their pitching," Riddoch. 
"Every one of their pitchers can take you to the seventh inning every time." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' array of No. 5 starters has gone seven innings only three times 
this season in 24 starts. The collection of Schiraldi, Eric Show and Mike Dunne 
have won all of two games in their starts as the Padres' fifth man. 
</P>
<P>
And Schiraldi didn't come close to a third victory. 
</P>
<P>
It's frightening enough for anyone to be facing the Mets' lineup -- leading the 
major leagues with 607 runs -- but when a pitcher is the man most responsible 
for your demise, it becomes a night he wants to forget the moment he sets foot 
on the New York streets. 
</P>
<P>
Schiraldi was getting along just fine through the first two innings, the only 
blemish a two-out walk to Johnson in the second inning. He figured the third 
inning would be a breeze, too, because he was facing the bottom of the order. 
His thinking didn't change after he retired No. 8 hitter Mackey Sasser. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Cone, who owns a .208 batting average with three RBIs. Well, the 
way those two squared off, you'd have thought it was a rematch of Bob Welch and 
Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Cone must have stood at the plate for five minutes while Schiraldi threw 
fastball after fastball trying to strike him out. Instead, Cone just sat back 
and kept fouling off pitch after pitch while the crowd shrieked with each. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on the 14th, after eight foul balls, Cone just looked at it. Ball 
four. The crowd went berserk. 
</P>
<P>
"That was unbelievable wasn't it?" Met second baseman Tim Teufel said. "I 
didn't know who would be more tired, Schiraldi or Cone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schiraldi: "You throw 14 pitches to anybody, and it will take something 
out of anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Once Cone walked, it was as if Schiraldi was a beaten man. He immediately 
unraveled. Cone went to second on a passed ball, and Daryl Boston followed with 
a single to center, sending Cone to third and advancing to second himself when 
Joe Carter's throw missed the cutoff man. Dave Magadan followed with a sharp 
single to right, and just like that, the Mets had a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They made it 4-0 in the next inning when Teufel -- playing for the first time 
in a week -- hit a two-run homer over the left-field fence, putting the Padres 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The way Cone was pitching, the Padres never had the chance to entertain any 
wild ideas about coming back. They not only couldn't get four runs after the 
fourth, they couldn't get four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after the third, the Padres failed to reach even second base. 
</P>
<P>
It all developed into the Padres' first shutout since June 13. They now have 
failed to obtain an extra-base hit in three of the past nine games. 
</P>
<P>
There's really little the Padres can do, they say, about rectifying their 
offensive woes before the end of the season. But as far as finding a No. 5 
starter, well, they at least have Derek Lilliquist and Atlee Hammaker standing 
by. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting my chance now, and that's all I'm thinking about," said Schiraldi, 
who's 1-4 with a 4.88 ERA in six starts. "I'm not going to put any added 
pressure on myself. I can't do that. I'm just going to do what I'm capable of 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's what has the Padres worried. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who has missed the past seven games with a 
strained right hamstring, could very well be in the starting lineup tonight 
against the Mets. Padre Manager Greg Riddoch almost put Clark in the starting 
lineup Tuesday, but decided to hold off for at least a day. "He's made great 
progress the past two days," Riddoch said, "and you can expect to see him any 
time now." . . . Atlee Hammaker, who was acquired Aug. 21, finally made his 
debut Monday night for the Padres, pitching three perfect innings. "Atlee 
Hammaker looks to me like he's built himself a pretty good beginning," Riddoch 
said. "He's pretty impressive." . . . Garry Templeton committed his 24th error 
in the sixth inning, raising the Padre total for shortstops to 33. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar's batting average dropped to .294 Monday, its lowest since April 
28. In his past 17 at-bats, he has struck out five times, hit into three double 
plays, grounded out six times, popped up in the infield twice and hit two 
singles. . . . Also slumping is Mike Pagliarulo, who is in a one-for-21 skid 
(.048), and batting .169 since Aug. 3. . . . Eric Show pitched a one-two-three 
eighth inning, and now has gone six consecutive appearances, spanning 8 1/3 
innings, without allowing a run. . . . The Mets' David Cone has pitched three 
consecutive complete games, the most by any Met pitcher since Dwight Gooden 
threw four in a row April 11-May 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder what happened to Don Schulze, one of the Padres' No. 5 starters of 
a year ago who came from the Yankees along with Mike Pagliarulo in the Walt 
Terrell trade? Take a look for him the next time you're in Japan. He's pitching 
for the Onix Braves, and is 4-4 with a 2.66 ERA. . . . The Padres will conclude 
their two-game series against the Mets at 4:35 p.m. (PDT) today. Andy Benes 
(10-8) and Gooden (14-6) are the scheduled starters. The Padres are off 
Thursday, and then will finish their 10-game trip with a four-game series 
beginning Friday in Philadelphia.

GROWING UP ON THE FARM IN NORTH DAKOTA MAKES BECOMING A TOP LINEMAN SEEM EASY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fields of golden sunflowers, dense stands of corn, thousands of acres of waving 
wheat lie beneath the hot summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
Fields of dreams, in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Straight, lightly traveled rural highways crisscross the endless flat farmland. 
The country road rolls through one farm town after another, past an occasional 
country cemetery, where tilted headstones mark the dreams of other times. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks cruise lazily over freshly plowed fields awaiting the late hay crop, 
looking for mice and insects. 
</P>
<P>
The Hansen farm lies eight miles south of Oakes, population 1,742, in 
southeastern North Dakota. Here, Allen Hansen, 50, raises corn, sunflowers, 
cattle, sheep, oats, millet and football players. The Hansens own 1,000 acres 
of farmland and lease another 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's No. 2 son, Phil, is an All-American senior defensive tackle up at 
Fargo, 120 miles away, at North Dakota State University. His No. 3 son, Steve, 
is a promising freshman linebacker at North Dakota State, America's best NCAA 
Division II football program. Oldest son John, who didn't play football, works 
the family farm with his father. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen is showing a reporter around his farm, explaining the economics of 
family farming and the necessary work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of my boys spent every day of their summers in fields like this 
one," he said, pointing to a 65-acre field, recently shorn of its wheat. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I say days, I mean sunup to sundown," he said. "Football is the 
perfect sport for my sons, because it requires a lot of work and preparation. 
Growing up here . . . heck, that's all my boys know, hard work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYER 
</P>
<P>
Press day at North Dakota State. The players are in green and gold game 
uniforms, copies of the Green Bay Packers' uniforms. Journalists from across 
North Dakota inspect, photograph and interview the players who hope to 
kick-start the 1990s with yet another Division II football championship, 
something the Bison achieved four times in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The North Dakota State Bison are the San Francisco 49ers of Division II 
football. In the 1980s, they were in the NCAA championship game six times and 
compiled an overall '80s record of 103-20-2. 
</P>
<P>
The school might be small, but the players aren't. One is 6 feet 7 and 310 
pounds. So Phil Hansen, at 6-6 and 265, doesn't necessarily stand out. Yet he 
is, by acclamation, the team's best player. The coach, Rocky Hager, expects 
Hansen will be drafted by the NFL next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, lean and flat-bellied, looks as if he could carry 300 pounds 
comfortably. He sat and talked about farm boys playing football. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I got to Fargo," he said, grinning, "I never heard the expression, nine 
to five. 
</P>
<P>
"My brothers and I were in the fields at 6:30 a.m., and we didn't come home 
until it was too dark to see. Planting, harvesting, cultivating, working with 
the cattle and sheep -- I didn't mind any of that. But the worst part was rock- 
picking -- clearing a new field of rocks before cultivating. That is hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is hard work, too, I guess, but Steve and I never thought much about 
that. We just did what was necessary to get ready to play. All our lives, our 
dad taught us that if someone is offering you an opportunity to do something, 
you owe them an honest day's work. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen went to a big high school, by North Dakota standards. At Oakes High, 
there were 50 in his graduating class. After his senior football season, he 
says, the coach from the University of North Dakota, at Grand Forks, called to 
offer him a full scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned him down, because I didn't know what a full ride was," Hansen said. 
"I had to go ask my coach." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen is an economics major and carries a B average. He doesn't see himself 
returning to the family farm as his principal livelihood, even though he is the 
president of the family farm corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been an assistant manufacturer's representative for a farm chemical 
company the past two summers, and I enjoy that," he said. "I'll always have 
something to do with the family farm, but not full time. I'd like to be 
involved in the business side of agriculture. I mean, I have 20 years of farm 
experience, it's not like I have a lot to learn about farming." 
</P>
<P>
First, many in Fargo predict, will come pro football. 
</P>
<P>
He dismisses it with a wave of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a bonus," he said. "If it happens -- great, but that's the kind 
of thing that just happens. My only football goal now is to play as well as I 
can so that we can win another national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know we're good enough to do it again, but we also know talking has 
nothing to do with it. We have to work very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Duke Babb, director of an NFL scouting combine, National Football Scouting of 
Tulsa, Okla., pegs Hansen as a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider him a prospect, based on what we saw of his junior year and 
assuming he plays well this season," Babb said. "We feel he'll be drafted." 
</P>
<P>
Hager, the coach and a former North Dakota farm boy himself, said Hansen is 
pure winner. 
</P>
<P>
"When I recruit kids, I always ask them the same question," he said. "I ask 
them which is more important, winning a North Dakota high school Class A or 
Class B state championship? When I asked Phil this several years ago, he looked 
at me kind of funny and said: 'Coach, winning is winning.' That was exactly the 
answer I wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, during an 8-3-1 North Dakota State season -- the Bison won their 
most recent national title in 1988 -- Hansen had 99 tackles, 30 of them 
unassisted, and broke up 17 pass plays, most of them blocks. He was the NCAA 
Division II player of the week twice, the first time after he had nine tackles, 
two sacks and a fumble recovery that set up a touchdown against Northern 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Warmath, the former Minnesota coach who scouts for the Minnesota 
Vikings, said last year that Hansen was North Dakota State's best pro prospect 
since it sent linebacker Steve Nelson to the New England Patriots in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Hager said: "Phil is his own biggest critic. He's a very sharp student of 
himself in the film room. If he sees his first step off the line was six inches 
instead of eight inches, he'll play it over and over. He'll get angry with 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a conference with every one of our players in the summer and when I 
talked with him, he said he wasn't happy with how he's played, in spite of all 
the honors he's earned here. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Coach, I just haven't got it yet, but I'm going to get it this 
year.' I asked him what it was, and he couldn't explain it, other than to say 
he doesn't believe he's approached his potential yet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COACH 
</P>
<P>
Hager's toughest decision was leaving the ranch to become a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Hager, 38, grew up on a horse ranch in Harvey, N.D., 200 miles from 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
"We raised primarily American saddle horses, but also thoroughbreds and 
American quarter horses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After my dad and grandfather had died, we had to sell everything. There was no 
one left in the family to run the ranch. I loved those horses. On the day (in 
1987) when we watched all our horses get loaded into trucks and watched them go 
down the road, well, that was a tough day. There were a lot of tears." 
</P>
<P>
But Hager found solace in football. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is the most perfect team sport," he said. "You have 11 men out there, 
each of whom has a deep understanding of how important he is to his teammates, 
and how much their teammates depend on him. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you have what we have, a whole team of men who are totally committed 
to repeating things time after time until they do it to perfection . . . it's 
hard to explain to a non-football person how fulfilling an experience that is 
to a coach." 
</P>
<P>
This season will be Hager's fourth as head coach at North Dakota State. He was 
the defensive coordinator before replacing Earle Solomonson, who left in 1986 
for Montana State. 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota State established itself as a Division II power in the early 
1960s, when Darrell Mudra went 24-6 over three seasons. Then Ron Erhardt, over 
seven seasons, went 61-7-1. Since 1965, the Bison have had seven unbeaten 
seasons and three times lost only once. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 25 seasons, there has been one losing season. During that period, 
58 Bison players have signed NFL or Canadian Football League contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Many who sport "Run With the Herd" decals on their cars expect that this might 
be NDSU's best team ever. 
</P>
<P>
But Hager worries first about surviving in the North Central Conference, made 
up of North Dakota State, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Dakota State, 
Augustana of South Dakota, Morningside of Iowa, Nebraska Omaha, Northern 
Colorado, and Mankato State and St. Cloud State of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"Morningside had an 0-10 season last year, yet we barely got out of there with 
a 26-20 win," Hager said. "It's a very well-balanced conference." 
</P>
<P>
Balanced, other coaches would say, beneath North Dakota State. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nebraska Omaha Coach Sandy Buda a year ago: "North Dakota State could 
compete with every team in the Big Eight except Oklahoma and Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
Life in Division II football means dealing with roughly half the resources of a 
Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
"The majors have 80 scholarships, we have 40," Hager said. "That pretty much 
sums it up. We have good athletes, but not nearly as many as a good Division I 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"That means our better athletes have to play more than one position when we 
need them to. When injuries catch up to us, we do a lot of position rotation." 
</P>
<P>
By necessity, Hager says he doesn't overlook any top North Dakota prep players. 
</P>
<P>
"We see everybody in North Dakota," he said. "If we recruit a kid who is also a 
major college prospect, we continue talking to him until he tells us he's going 
to a major school. We also recruit everything between here and Minneapolis." 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of Hager's 1990 roster is composed of North Dakota players, the 
rest from Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
This season, there's a major college prospect at South High in Fargo, Chris 
Berg, a tall, dropback quarterback who can throw a football 75 yards. Hager 
runs an option offense and he was asked how a dropback passer would fit into 
his offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd fit in just fine because if we get him, we will go to a dropback 
offense," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
And since he is one of them, Hager has a soft spot in his heart for North 
Dakota farm boys. He estimates that slightly fewer than half of his players 
grew up on farms. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see a subtle difference between our farm boys and the others," he said. 
"There is a carry-over from the farm work ethic. They're quiet kids, basically, 
but if they have something to say, if they think the coaches are doing 
something wrong, they're not afraid to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
"And I see it in their willingness to commit themselves to doing things right. 
They learn early on the farm that there are no short cuts, no easy ways to do 
something that's difficult. So in practice when we ask them to do something 
over and over until they get it right, they understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Hager has occasionally had players from warmer climes, but many never make it 
through their first North Dakota winter. Bison followers call this phenomenon 
"winter kill." Hager can't understand someone who balks at northern Midwest 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what jacket hoods and underwear with handles are for," he says with a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hager's most important recruits are members of Team Makers, the NDSU 
intercollegiate sports support group. It's a statewide organization of 1,500 
members, each of whom contributes $50 to $2,500 to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Team Makers has been a prime mover in a new stadium project for the university. 
The school plays at 16,500-seat Dacotah Field, but construction has started 
next door on a domed, 20,000-seat facility being built by the city of Fargo, to 
be leased to the university. The $37-million project is being financed by a 
half-cent city sales tax on purchases under $19. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, outdoor football has been played in December here in clear, 60-degree 
weather. But it has also been played in blizzards so intense that first-row 
spectators at Dacotah Field couldn't see the team bench. 
</P>
<P>
Hager was asked how he likes the Division II football playoff format, in which 
16 teams participate in a postseason playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 14-0 in '88 and that made for a long season," he said. "The teams who 
do well late in the playoffs tend to be the ones who are healthiest. I'd like 
the present format a little better if we could have a two-week break between 
the last regular-season game and the first playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FARM 
</P>
<P>
Allen Hansen's farm backs up to a national wildlife refuge across the James 
River, which flows through the Hansen property. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed across the river, to the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"We build some blinds here, and hunt the snow and Canada geese that fly across 
the river in the fall," he said. "That's the one thing about my boys that's 
different from me. I love to hunt. Now, they'll hunt, but they don't love it 
like I do." 
</P>
<P>
He showed a visitor the water pump he uses to bring irrigation water out of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had dry years lately, so water's been a big expense for us," he said. 
"When we use river water in a wet year, it costs us about $20 per acre in a 
year. This year, since it's dry, the bill is up to $30 to $35 an acre. And this 
field (oats) alone here is 65 acres." 
</P>
<P>
He drove his pickup truck by a cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we'll get 150 bushels per acre off of this field, and with corn right 
now going for $2.43 a bushel, that's pretty fair. You always come out OK anyhow 
with corn, since the cows eat the stalks in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew about 500 acres of bread wheat this year," he said. "You go further 
north in North Dakota and you'll see durum wheat -- that's pasta wheat." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Hansen and his sons have gone through hard times on the farm -- much 
tougher times than Phil or Steve will encounter on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
"We went broke in 1981," Hansen said, driving past a field of towering 
sunflowers. "Lost everything. In those days, we had thousands of cattle. Now we 
have hundreds. It was my own fault. Prices were good in the late 1970s, they 
were rising every year, and I was borrowing to get more land, more livestock 
and more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"So when prices fell, the interest on our borrowed money was soon eating us 
alive. It was tough, to be in a situation where all the hard work in the world 
had nothing to do with solving a problem. But once I admitted to myself that I 
was broke and had to start over, that made it easier to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"So we sold everything, and started over. We're about half the size we used to 
be, but we've paid everyone off. We're in charge of our lives again."

SOME SAY, HEY, MAYS OF '90S PLAYS IN SEATTLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
How often do the realities exceed the myths, even for a legend in the making 
like Ken Griffey Jr.? With the Seattle Mariners' prodigy of a center fielder -- 
known alternately as "The Kid," "The Natural" or just "Junior," depending upon 
whose turn it is to hand out the superlatives -- the actual surpasses the 
expected and the rumored regularly. 
</P>
<P>
It's just one of many traits possessed by baseball's youngest and newest 
superstar that fall into the awe-inspiring, almost-frightening category. 
Griffey has become a conversation piece around the league, the player opponents 
gather around the batting cage to watch and about whom scouts and executives 
run up long-distance telephone bills, swapping tales of amazing exploits. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have people around the league calling me for confirmation of 
something they heard Junior did," Mariners batting coach Gene Clines said 
recently. "I'll tell them it's true, and then they'll say something like: 'No 
way. No one's that good.' And I'll say: 'This kid is.' ... It's nice to be 
around for the start of something big." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the making of a legend is something to behold. Griffey labors in 
relative obscurity here, though that will soon change if the Mariners sign his 
father as expected. But his exploits have demanded notice and have prompted 
comparisons to a young outfielder of four decades ago who also wore No. 24 -- 
Willie Mays. Mariners Manager Jim Lefebvre doesn't particularly care for the 
parallel, but concedes he recognizes its validity. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little of this, a little of that," Lefebvre said. "I like to say 
there's a lot of his dad in him. Junior and Ken Griffey Sr. really are quite a 
bit alike. But yeah, the Mays comparison probably has some merit, especially if 
you're talking about defense." 
</P>
<P>
And Lefebvre does. He can reel off the memorable efforts of Griffey's brief but 
glittering career: There was the nearly 400-foot throw to nab Robin Yount at 
third base as he tried to stretch a double into a triple, the lunging grab 
against the wall in Boston to rob Wade Boggs of extra bases and the 
back-to-the-plate snatch of a Rickey Henderson drive that conjured the clearest 
visions of Mays. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's this season's most celebrated defensive gem -- the 
breathtaking ascent over the Yankee Stadium fence to pull in a Jesse Barfield 
homer-to-be. That remarkable play left the New York outfielder with hands on 
hips and a disbelieving frown as he stood halfway between first and second 
while Griffey trotted past him to the Seattle dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I like to play defense," Griffey said in his fidgety, apparently 
disinterested way. "It's the only chance I get to make someone else mad." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of American League pitchers would disagree. Griffey creates plenty of 
frustration with his bat -- a black Louisville Slugger that's the same model 
his father uses, except that the younger Griffey has his weapons inscribed with 
"The Kid." 
</P>
<P>
Only a broken hand in July kept Griffey from being last year's AL rookie of the 
year. When he broke in he was the youngest player in the majors at 19, and 
posted a .264, 16-home run, 61-RBI campaign that was less impressive 
statistically than it looked to first-hand observers. His grace afield and 
smooth left-handed stroke warned of the coming of an era of dominance. 
</P>
<P>
A September skid that saw him hit .181 may have been his condensed 
searching-for-himself experience, for he has returned with a vengeance this 
season. Currently, Griffey is batting .306, in the league's top 10. He has 17 
homers and 60 RBI, and tops the AL with 151 hits. His 43 multiple-hit games 
also lead the league, and he is among the AL's top 10 in runs, total bases and 
slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
He led the league's batting race for nearly a month before Henderson overtook 
him, and he became the second-youngest starter (to Al Kaline) in the history of 
the all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
"The sky's the limit for him," said Griffey Sr., who recently agreed to go on 
the voluntarily retired list to help the Cincinnati Reds out of a roster 
problem but last week was waived instead. That should enable him to join the 
Mariners soon to finish out the season playing alongside his son. Last season, 
the two became the first father and son to play in the major leagues at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Griffey makes certain to catch himself before the fatherly gushing 
goes too far. "Don't tell him I said that," he continued. "He's hard enough for 
the Seattle coaches to deal with already." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem -- or perhaps a charming key to success -- with 
Griffey the younger. One of the most common words used to describe him is 
"difficult." Those around him are quick to caution they don't mean he's a 
troublemaker or a malcontent; it's simply that Griffey is only two years 
removed from high school and shows it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a bad kid," his father said. "I'm certainly not trying to tell you 
that. It's just that he's not a student of the game. He listens to rap songs 
instead of studying pitchers. He operates on instincts and ability, and 
sometimes very little else. Once he matures a little bit -- and his mother 
isn't sure that day ever will come -- he'll be a very, very difficult opponent 
on a baseball field." 
</P>
<P>
These are the kinds of word-of-mouth stories that usually are found to be 
greatly exaggerated: A player doesn't know who the pitchers are. He doesn't 
know who the opposing batters are. He can't distinguish good hitting mechanics 
from a weekend softballer's stroke. Rarely are the tales borne out, at least 
not fully. 
</P>
<P>
With Griffey, though, they're almost all true -- or at least they were a few 
months ago. He admits he really didn't know who Bert Blyleven was. He's 
familiar with the repertoires and tendencies of only a few AL pitchers. He 
concedes he really didn't know anything about any of the Baltimore Orioles 
except Cal Ripken Jr. When in doubt, he plays a straightaway center field and 
uses his extraordinary athleticism to compensate for any deficiencies in 
positioning. 
</P>
<P>
"People try to make the game too complicated," he said. "You hit the ball, you 
run, you go after it and catch it. You might not be able to figure out what 
pitch the guy's going to throw you, but eventually he has to throw something 
across the plate that I can hit. It's a simple game, really. I know what I can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
That casual approach has led him to make more than his share of head-scratching 
mistakes. During a recent series here against Baltimore, he swung at a 
borderline-low pitch from Pete Harnisch after Harnisch had begun the game by 
throwing 11 straight balls. 
</P>
<P>
He gets picked off and throws to the wrong base occasionally. He possesses 
great speed, but has just 15 stolen bases in 25 attempts. He has drawn 55 walks 
-- a respectable total but not one that reflects the careful manner he is 
pitched to in virtually every at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
He resisted when Lefebvre moved him from second to fifth in the batting order 
earlier this season, although he was immediately enamored with a later switch 
to third. When Lefebvre first asked him last year to show up for early batting 
practice -- a standard practice on his teams -- Griffey was alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
An M.C. Hammer tape blasting through headphones is his preferred entertainment. 
He's had a sports car since he got his driver's license and an immense phone 
bill for as long as he can remember, courtesy of his father's generosity and a 
family closeness that leads him to call home almost every night. His 
youthfulness is unabashedly intact. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lefebvre bristles at notions that Griffey is a wide-eyed kid acting on 
reckless instinct alone. He's quick to remind that Griffey is learning the 
game, and learning it in the major leagues at an age when most players are 
doing the same in college or the minors. 
</P>
<P>
The metamorphosis toward a veteran approach seems to be taking place already. 
Griffey says he has begun to note patterns in the ways he's being pitched. He 
doesn't live by those observations yet, but that might come. He recognizes more 
opponents, even if the purpose is a pre-game handshake rather than an intricate 
working knowledge of their playing styles. 
</P>
<P>
Might he even have a handy notebook full of information on pitchers within a 
few years? "Nah, that would be taking it too far, I think," he said. "I kind of 
like things the way they are."

<P>
USC: ONLY SEVEN RETURN, GIVING THE NO. 9 TROJANS THEIR LEAST-EXPERIENCED TEAM 
SINCE 1965. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A record-equaling fourth consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl might be too much to 
ask of a young, mostly inexperienced USC football team. 
</P>
<P>
But what's the harm in asking? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to put any limitations on ourselves," said Coach Larry Smith, 
whose ninth-ranked Trojans will play Syracuse at East Rutherford, N.J., Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for a season that will include games against five bowl winners 
from last season and only five games at the Coliseum, Smith has had to replace 
nine defensive starters from a unit that ranked first in the nation in rushing 
defense and second in total defense last season. 
</P>
<P>
Among the missing are All-American linebacker Junior Seau and All-American 
safety Mark Carrier, who gave up their senior seasons and were among the first 
six players chosen in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, seven starters had to be replaced, including three first-team 
all-conference linemen, the school's all-time lead ing receiver and a fullback 
who was a two-time all-conference selection and the most productive rusher at 
the position in USC history. 
</P>
<P>
The seven returning Trojan starters are the fewest since 1965. More than half 
the players on the 44-man, two-deep chart are underclassmen, and USC seems 
especially vulnerable in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smith's goals remain unchanged: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beat UCLA and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win the Pacific-10 championship and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of talent, Smith said, the Trojans of 1990 are "probably on a par" 
with his first three USC teams, which were 21-1-1 against the Pac-10 and ended 
each season in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's tough to judge a team before it plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Trojans have reasons to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 1 is quarterback Todd Marinovich, college football's freshman of the 
year in 1989, when he took over as an 11th-hour replacement for injured Pat 
O'Hara and guided the Trojans to a 9-2-1 record -- including a 17-10 victory 
over Michigan in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
After a season during which he set a school record by completing 62.2% of his 
passes, Marinovich ranks sixth on the Trojans' all-time passing list. 
</P>
<P>
Is Smith concerned that he, too, might leave school early? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Smith said. "He's a prime candidate, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, 6 feet 4 and 210 pounds, will be asked to throw deep more often 
this season to take advantage of the Trojans' speed on the flanks and to open 
the short game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a high-completion passer, so we've got to get people back off us, so 
he can continue to be a high-percentage passer," Smith said. "The way to do 
that is to go downtown and say, 'Here we come.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans will challenge defenses with a talented group of receivers, 
including senior Gary Wellman and sophomore Joel Scott, who are expected to 
start after combining for 41 receptions last season. Six of Wellman's 23 
catches went for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of John Jackson, USC's all-time leading receiver, several others 
are expected to play quite a bit, too, including sophomores Larry Wallace and 
Travis Hannah, redshirt freshman Johnnie Morton and freshman Curtis Conway. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, expected to be used in a variety of roles, has been compared to Notre 
Dame's multitalented Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. Said Marinovich: "If you think 
Rocket is fast, wait till you see Curtis." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Marinovich in the backfield will be tailback Ricky Ervins, a durable 
5-8, 190-pound senior who led the Pac-10 in rushing last season and was the 
most valuable player in the Rose Bowl game. He ran for 1,395 yards and scored 
11 touchdowns as a junior, the most productive season for a Trojan tailback 
since 1981, when Marcus Allen ran for 2,427 yards and won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins also was USC's No. 2 receiver with 39 receptions. Smith calls him "the 
key to the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins' backup, junior Scott Lockwood, will also be used at fullback, where the 
Trojans hope to fill the void left by Leroy Holt. Lockwood, who started five 
games at tailback two years ago and ran for 527 yards, is back after missing 
last season because of torn ligaments in his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Raoul Spears probably will start at fullback, Smith said. He and 
redshirt freshman Rory Brown have been capable blockers, Smith said, but 
neither has distinguished himself as a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Among the offensive linemen, All-American guard Mark Tucker and tackle Pat 
Harlow, a 6-7, 270-pound senior, are returning starters. Others expected to 
start include redshirt freshman David Apolskis at center, junior Michael Moody 
at tackle and junior Derrick Deese, a transfer from El Camino College, at 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Frank Griffin, who caught 14 passes last season, will be the starter at 
tight end, with sophomore Yonnie Jackson backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Trojans probably won't be as imposing as they were the last 
two seasons, when they ranked first in the Pac-10 and among the best in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be able to just shut people down," defensive coordinator 
Chris Allen said. "We feel like we're going to have to make some big plays to 
stop people. We're going to have to cause fumbles. I got the feeling last year 
in some games that when our defense went out there, it was going to be three 
downs and out. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, people are going to get first downs on us. We're just not going to 
be as dominant, and we're going to make some mistakes. We've got to rally to 
the ball and make big plays to compensate for that." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of a defense that Smith has described as "the fastest I've ever 
coached" will be in a group of linebackers led by senior Scott Ross. A 
fourth-year starter and two-time All-conference selection, Ross is "an assassin 
to the enemies' statistics," in the words of Tom Roggeman, the assistant who 
coaches the Trojans' inside linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
Ross will be joined on the inside by junior Matt Gee and two capable backups, 
senior Brian Tuliau and redshirt freshman Gidion Murrell. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Seau at one outside linebacker position will be senior Craig 
Hartsuyker, a starter two years ago before he was replaced last season by Seau, 
the Pac-10's defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Kurt Barber is expected to start on the other side, with sophomores 
David Webb and J.R. Chesley and freshman Willie McGinest, who has been 
impressive in his first camp, in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
On the line, the Trojans will count heavily on senior Don Gibson, who started 
at nose guard for two seasons before being sidelined last season because of a 
knee injury. Gibson will alternate between nose guard and defensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a force as long as he holds together," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
With All-American tackle Tim Ryan and all-conference defensive guard Dan Owens 
now playing in the NFL, redshirt freshman Terry McDaniels will move into Ryan's 
spot, and senior Gene Fruge will share time with redshirt freshman Mike Hinz at 
nose guard and defensive guard, depending on where Gibson is positioned. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary, Carrier's departure left USC with no returning starters. And 
a career-ending injury this month to DeChon Burns left the Trojans with only 
two players with more than limited experience. 
</P>
<P>
Two starters, senior Marcus Hopkins at strong safety and junior Calvin Holmes 
at cornerback, are converted tailbacks. And at least one redshirt freshman will 
start -- Howard McCowan, Marcel Brown or Mike Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Allen called Hopkins and sophomore Stephon Pace, who will alternate 
between cornerback and free safety, "as good as anybody we've ever had." And 
Bobby April, who coaches the secondary, said of the Trojan defensive backs: 
"It's a great unit with great talent." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "We'll be better defensively than people give us credit for. We had 
a lot of losses -- a lot of big-name losses -- but I think we've got more 
experience on defense than what paper shows." 
</P>
<P>
Quin Rodriguez, entering his fourth season as kicker, needs 13 field goals to 
break Steve Jordan's USC record of 51. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Ron Dale and senior Marc Preston are the punters.

Two trades, hardly of the blockbuster variety, three cuts and three injury 
settlements put the Chargers' roster officially at the required 60-man limit 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Keith English, who averaged 41.7 yards during the first three exhibition 
games, was traded to the Rams for a 10th-round draft selection, General Manager 
Bobby Beathard said. English, cut by the Raiders in exhibition season last 
year, doesn't have the same versatility as starter John Kidd, who also holds on 
place-kicks and played quarterback in college. 
</P>
<P>
After acquiring English, the Rams basically handed him a job by cutting former 
Charger Hank Ilesic and Kent Elmore, a seventh-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
In the second trade, the Chargers acquired offensive guard Mike Zandofsky from 
Phoenix for a low-round draft choice. Zandofsky, 24, started seven games last 
season as a rookie from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks pretty good to us on film," Beathard said. "He's a real tough 
aggressive football player. We liked him when we were down there scrimmaging 
against Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will be required to make another roster cut when Zandofsky 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
In other moves Tuesday, the Chargers agreed to injury settlements with tackle 
Joey Howard (knee), running back Joe Mickles (knee) and wide receiver Troy 
Johnson (punctured lung). This means all three are released but will be on the 
team's payroll until it is determined that they are healthy enough to practice. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, Beathard says Mickles is the biggest loss. A second-year running 
back from Mississippi, Mickles had established himself as a valuable special 
teams player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing well, but he does have a knee that's going to need surgery 
sooner or later," Beathard said. "He was playing on it, but it was only a 
matter of time before it went." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Chargers would consider bringing either Mickles or Johnson 
back if there are injury problems during the regular season. But it appears 
Howard is gone for good. 
</P>
<P>
"Joey had opportunities," Coach Dan Henning said. "He was struggling early (in 
camp). I think he needs a change of scenery. He's got talent, and I think he's 
capable of playing. He's got to believe he's got it. Sometimes, I'm not sure he 
does believe he has it." 
</P>
<P>
Also waived Tuesday were defensive end Leonard Johnson, wide receiver Lee Allen 
and kicker John Carney. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Carney wasn't surprising. Henning had indicated Sunday that the 
Chargers were leaning toward Fuad Reveiz, who kicked for the Miami Dolphins 
from 1985-88 before missing last season with an injury. Beathard said releasing 
Carney allows the Chargers another week to evaluate players at other positions. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Seau, the Charger's first-round draft selection from USC, spent his 
first full day at training camp Tuesday, and Henning said he fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been excellent," Henning said. "He's not where he wants to be, obviously. 
He's got a lot to remember now to get back into the comfort zone of being able 
to go out there and not think. 
</P>
<P>
"He raises up the tempo of everybody around him. He's shown quickness, and he's 
shown strength." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning is concerned with depth at three positions: offensive tackle, 
cornerback and tight end. All have been depleted by injuries. . . . Asked about 
his primary objective in Saturday's final exhibition against the Raiders, 
Henning said: "Get out of it healthy."

SCRAMBLING OF NFL TELECASTS OPPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SAN DIEGO CONGRESSMAN, CITING WIDE SUPPORT IN WASHINGTON, WILL 
INTRODUCE A BILL TO PROHIBIT SUCH ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional opposition to the scrambling of NFL telecasts has begun forming 
in Washington, with a San Diego congressman announcing Tuesday that he intends 
to introduce "de-scrambling" legislation after Congress reconvenes Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) claims to have the backing of "30 to 40" senators 
and congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Said Greg Aiello, the NFL's director of communications: "We don't have a 
reaction. It's a speculative situation, so we would react at the time . . . if 
something happens." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.), a ranking member of the House Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance, said he opposes scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public is already paying for (NFL football) in the form of 
advertising subsidies when they buy those products at the supermarkets," Tauzin 
said in a statement. "Therefore, those signals -- those games -- should not be 
scrambled." 
</P>
<P>
Tauzin's press secretary, Chris Robichaux, said Tauzin would not oppose NFL 
scrambling as long as the league made available "fair and reasonable" 
de-scrambling packages. 
</P>
<P>
However, the NFL has said that no such option will be available -- except on 
ESPN and TNT, which will televise some night games as part of the new four-year 
agreement. ABC's "Monday Night Football" also will not be scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
Games on CBS will be "fully scrambled" by Sept. 9. NBC's $5-million scrambling 
technology is expected to be in place by mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional opposition to scrambling was also heard from Senators Arlen 
Specter (R-Penn.) and Albert Gore (D-Tenn.). Roy Neel, administrative assistant 
to Gore, said the senator "respects the NFL's lawful right to protect its 
copyrighted signals" but to "freeze out" millions of rural viewers across the 
country who watch games via satellite dish would be "a terrible blow." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Meehan, an aide to Sen. Specter of Pennsylvania, said Meehan believes that 
Congress has been "too soft" on professional sports leagues, particularly in 
regard to antitrust legislation. By being entitled to such exemptions, Meehan 
said, the NFL and other sports leagues are "obligated by law" to make their 
products available, through television, "at no charge." 
</P>
<P>
"If the professional sports leagues want their antitrust exemptions, there 
should be no charge to the viewers," Specter testified in May before the House 
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan said that fears about antitrust violations are "probably the very 
reason" the league is not making available a de-scrambling alternative, "which, 
in the eyes of some, would constitute pay-per-view." 
</P>
<P>
He and others pointed out, however, that through a variety of cable services, 
major league baseball and the NBA offer de-scrambling options available only 
through an authorized decoder and the payment of a fee. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, opposition to scrambling heated up Monday night at a meeting 
attended by 65 backers of the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights, a Southern 
California group formed by restaurateur Norman Lebovitz. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said that he has received "hundreds" of calls from Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, as well as other parts of the country, since the NFL 
announced its scrambling decision Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited -- we're not going to lose," Lebovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the NFL had as much intelligence as wealth, they would figure out a way to 
make this work and back out gracefully right now. I don't see anybody this 
isn't affecting, from the rural farmer who will have no access to professional 
football, to the average guy on the street, to the congressman or senator. The 
reaction is overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said his organization is contemplating a partnership with a 
Miami-based group, United Sports Fans of America, "which would then put our 
membership over 4,000." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami group has been involved in litigation with the NFL, as have interests 
in other cities. But as Val Pinchbeck, the NFL vice president in charge of 
broadcasting, said, the league has won "each and every" court case in which 
television was an issue. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego meeting was also attended by Capitol Hill lobbyist Glenn Jensen, 
who works for a Delaware-based organization called C-SAT Broadcasting, which he 
described as a grass-roots effort designed to protect the interests of 
satellite dish owners. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said the NFL's stated reason for scrambling -- that it protects local 
affiliates and thus local advertisers -- is "nonsense." He said the league's 
sole reason for not offering a de-scrambling package is its fear of antitrust 
legislation, "which is its No. 1 concern and always has been. It's a monopoly 
that has to protect the monopoly. The only way to do that is through an 
antitrust exemption." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen that said the timing of the NFL's announcement was "calculated" to have 
"the least impact, when congressmen and senators and telecommunications aides 
are on holiday or up to their eyeballs in the conflict overseas. Don't think 
the timing wasn't perfectly planned." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Hewitt, president of a national satellite group called the Satellite 
Broadcasting and Communications Assn., said that his organization is not 
opposed to scrambling "per se" but wants the NFL to offer an alternative paid 
for by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt said he has done an informal study that shows how much money the NFL is 
missing by "turning its back" on a de-scrambling option. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think they're greedy," he said. "But in this case, I think 
they're just being stupid. I don't think they'd have any trouble with antitrust 
either, because this is what the fans want (a de-scrambling alternative)." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt said his study shows that if 50,000 of the estimated 200,000 bars and 
restaurants in the country equipped with satellite technology were willing to 
pay $300 a month for NFL de-scrambling, "that's $15 million a month they're 
saying no to. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you who wins in this scenario. The crooks do, that's who. It isn't 
that hard to unscramble any scrambled signal -- it's being done all over the 
country. So, by not offering a de-scrambling option, the NFL is just handing 
over revenue -- millions of it -- to pirates all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Their decision is bad for bars, bad for restaurants, bad for consumers, bad 
for the satellite industry -- but most of all, it's bad for the NFL. They're 
the biggest losers of all."

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A BIG 3 THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oregon football Coach Rich Brooks contends that there isn't a bad team in the 
Pacific 10 Conference and the previous have-nots in the league have narrowed 
the talent gap with USC, UCLA and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If so, this could be the year an upstart team wins the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Parity hasn't been evident, though, in the league since 1972. USC or UCLA have 
represented the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl 14 times in that span, with Washington 
making three appearances and Arizona State one. 
</P>
<P>
USC has been the dominant team recently with three consecutive championships 
and only one conference loss in that span, to Oregon in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are widely favored again but that is primarily based on USC's track 
record, not necessarily on the relative strength, or experience of its team 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely that Oregon State or California will suddenly be a contender, 
but a case can be made for several teams preventing USC from winning a fourth 
consecutive conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody can get through the league without a loss, as USC has in 
the last two years," said Brooks, who is in his 14th season as Oregon's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"However, USC has to be the favorite for what they've done in the last three 
years. They have some questions, though, and everybody else has a chance, and 
some have better chances than others. 
</P>
<P>
"The three teams that finished second last year have to be in the hunt -- 
Oregon, Arizona and Washington. Most of the preseason people move Arizona and 
Washington up and drop us to the bottom half and that remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody forges upward, somebody has to go downward. UCLA obviously is a 
team that is going to rebound and be a major factor, and I hear great things 
about Arizona State. Stanford and Cal have legitimate cases for improved 
records. And Washington State and Oregon State return skilled people and 
talented quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough league. You can't say someone is terrible, like it was. If you're 
not ready every week, you can get beat, and it didn't used to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
Schedules may be the determining factor as to which team represents the 
conference in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, Washington apparently has an advantage, playing USC, UCLA, 
Arizona and Oregon at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Brigham Young, Oregon has a relatively soft nonconference 
schedule and doesn't play USC. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't break my heart," Brooks said, referring to the omission of the 
Trojans on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Pac-10 will be recognized for its proficient quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every team has an experienced quarterback, among them Arizona State's 
Paul Justin, USC's Todd Marinovich and Oregon's Bill Musgrave. 
</P>
<P>
"This league is incredible when you look at the quarterbacks," Brooks said. 
"For instance, the NFL's No. 1 draft choice, Troy Aikman, was only honorable 
mention in the conference two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the teams, excepting USC and UCLA, with 1989 overall and 
conference records: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats are the only Pac-10 member that hasn't played in the Rose Bowl 
game, but they're closing in on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a better chance to be a better football team because, hopefully, we'll 
throw the ball better," Coach Dick Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
If so, quarterbacks Ronald Veal, a better runner than passer, and George 
Malauulu will have to deliver on a team that led the league in rushing last 
year with its option, I-bone attack, but was last in passing, averaging only 
81.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu showed some promise as a passer until he missed the last two games in 
1989 with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the Wildcats appear solid with 12 returning starters and a strong 
running back corps that will be bolstered by the return of Art Greathouse, who 
was inactive with a foot injury last year. 
</P>
<P>
Inspiration will be provided by Arizona linebacker Kevin Singleton, who has 
been medically cleared to play after having been found to have leukemia 13 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989: 6-4-1, 3-3-1, fifth place 
</P>
<P>
In a quarterback-talented conference, Paul Justin stands tall, figuratively and 
literally, at 6 feet 5. 
</P>
<P>
He threw for nearly 1,500 yards in the last four games last season, including 
534 against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Justin will be throwing to young receivers and Coach Larry Marmie could take 
the pressure off his quarterback with a solid running game. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Russell, a 6-foot-3, 235-pound back, could be the catalyst. He has 
returned to ASU after two years at a community college, Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The defense was the worst in the conference last year, allowing an average of 
406.7 yards a game. But eight starters are back, among them talented free 
safety Nathan LaDuke. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a more productive player in America than Nathan," Marmie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
1989: 4-7, 2-6, 10th 
</P>
<P>
California, which was a finesse team with graduated quarterback Troy Taylor, is 
trying to change to a more balanced attack. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is the school's leader in passing yardage but also might have set 
another record as the most sacked quarterback in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
The previously one-dimensional Bears will rely more on running backs Greg 
Wallace and Greg Zomalt, who will be operating behind a huge, experienced 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bruce Snyder hopes to take the pressure off inexperienced quarterbacks 
Mike Pawlawski and Perry Klein with an improved running game and six returning 
starters from a defense that yielded an average of 26.2 points a game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Cal hasn't had a winning season since 1982 and it remains to be seen whether a 
new offensive philosophy will dramatically alter its second-division status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OREGON 
</P>
<P>
1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place 
</P>
<P>
Oregon made its first bowl appearance -- Independence -- in 26 years last 
season and Brooks has improved his program to the point that he will be 
disappointed if the Ducks don't go to a bowl game again. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good team and I think we can make a run at it," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has lost its two leading ground gainers, Derek Loville and Latin Berry, 
but Brooks is enthusiastic about tailback Ngalu Kelemeni and Brandon Jumper, a 
250-pound fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Musgrave, who passed for 2,761 yards and 20 touchdowns last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the best quarterback in the conference and one of the best in the 
nation," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
As for defense, Brooks said, "We lost some good players, but I feel good that 
we have a good group stepping up. We were second in total offense and defense 
in the conference last year and I don't think we should fall far in those 
phases." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks also have seven home games for the first time in the school's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OREGON STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989: 4-7-1, 3-4-1, sixth place 
</P>
<P>
Four wins in a season the last two years may not seem like much to most 
schools, but for Oregon State, it's a steppingstone. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Nebraska, Oregon State has a light nonconference schedule 
and, with some luck, it might even win five games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers have an overachieving quarterback, Matt Booher, who lifts weights 
with the linemen and passes effectively on the run. 
</P>
<P>
He'll have to move quickly this year with a rebuilt offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has another battering fullback in 244-pound James Jones, 
replacing Pat Chaffey, a fifth-round draft choice of the Chicago Bears, and an 
exceptional nose guard in Esera Tuaolo. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State upset UCLA last year and may surprise some unsuspecting team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STANFORD 
</P>
<P>
1989: 3-5, 3-8, seventh place 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, once the quarterback school of the country with the likes of Jim 
Plunkett and John Elway, is changing its image. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback position has been mediocre, at best, in recent years and it 
remains to be seen whether Jason Palumbis, who plunged to No. 4 on the depth 
chart last season but won the starting job in spring practice, is any more 
effective a passer than Steve Smith, who ranked eighth in the conference last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal should have an effective running game with Jon Volpe, a 1,000-yard 
rusher who missed most of last season with injuries, along with Glyn Milburn 
and Ellery Roberts, transfers from Oklahoma and Miami, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Green also has some gifted receivers, notably Ed McCaffrey. And four of last 
year's five starters on the offensive line return. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Stanford has six starters from a unit that that was just average 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
More will be known about Stanford after its opening two games, Colorado and 
UCLA, both on the road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place 
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl fever is prevalent in Seattle, and even the new quarterback, 
left-handed Mark Brunell, is caught up with it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely a Rose Bowl team," he said. "That's our No. 1 goal. That's 
all we talk about. We want the Rose Bowl, or we don't want anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have lost some skilled players, such as All-American center Bern 
Brostek, quarterback Cary Conklin and 300-pound defensive lineman Dennis Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is reason for optimism in the Husky camp. 
</P>
<P>
Operating behind a mammoth offensive line, a trademark of Don James' teams, 
will be talented tailback Greg Lewis, who rushed for 1,100 yards in James' 
one-back set last year. There are skilled wide receivers Orlando McKay and 
Mario Bailey, and a robust defense led by linebacker James Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 16th season at Washington, James is the dean of Pac-10 coaches with 
a record of 119-51-2. He has also coached the Huskies into 11 bowl games, the 
most recent a 34-7 victory over Florida in the 1989 Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hasn't played in the Rose Bowl, though, since the 1981 season -- and 
it apparently believes it is long overdue to return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989: 6-5, 3-5, seventh place 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Price is known for his motivational gimmicks, such as "shooting" a 
student, who was dressed as a USC Trojan and riding a horse around the practice 
field, with a track starter's pistol. 
</P>
<P>
He has also walked to practice in a duck-hunting outfit the week of the Oregon 
game and dressed like an Arizona State mascot while giving his team a pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Price will need more than gimmicks to inspire his Cougars this year, though, 
since he has only four defensive starters returning. 
</P>
<P>
Price does have All-American kicker Jason Hanson and proven quarterbacks in 
Brad Gossen and Aaron Garcia.

MELVIN DURSLAG: EVEN HIS PROS GAVE IT OLD COLLEGE TRY

<TEXT>
<P>
In a manner of speaking, Clemson is out on bail, which is to say, it is allowed 
by the NCAA to continue football operations, but is under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
It has a new coach, Ken Hatfield, shifting from Arkansas to replace Danny Ford, 
who wasn't exactly fired. He was paid off and asked to vanish. 
</P>
<P>
He departed a team, however gathered, that posted a record of 10-2, including a 
27-7 victory over West Virginia in the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The team would be ranked one of the best on defense in the land. And six of 
these defenders, named All-ACC, are back. 
</P>
<P>
What we have here is a sort of lunatic index to a game against Clemson 
undertaken Saturday by Cal State Long Beach, George Herbert Allen, coach. 
</P>
<P>
George didn't book this game. It merely became his responsibility when, at 72, 
he accepted the coaching post at Long Beach, from where units have sailed to 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
George wishes he were with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you aware that Clemson is a 37 1/2-point favorite?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone told me Clemson was favored by 58," he answered. "We may have a shot." 
</P>
<P>
What can be said in behalf of your team?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we are playing at Clemson, where the home team will have 80,000 rooters. 
There will be heavy humidity we are not used to. Clemson's lines outweigh us an 
average of 24 pounds. And Clemson has a new coach eager to get off to a good 
start and land in the polls' top 10." 
</P>
<P>
"And that only adds up to 37 1/2 points?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Clemson coach," George continues, "looked at his team in practice and told 
the press that no one from his Arkansas team, which went to the Cotton Bowl 
last season, could land a starting job on this club." 
</P>
<P>
George pondered this a moment. "But don't say anything that is going to 
discourage my players. Just run the headline, 'Allen Fears Clemson.' " 
</P>
<P>
Back to his old modus operandi, George is flying in his team two days ahead of 
the game, as he usually did with the Rams and Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll arrive Thursday night and have a meeting," he says. "We will then have a 
meeting Friday morning, work out and have a nap before dinner." 
</P>
<P>
On the road with the Rams, George put his players down for a nap on Saturday 
afternoon, promising each an extra $10 for dinner if the performer was in his 
room when George checked. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bass inquired: "Coach, if I take a nap with a girl, do I get $20?" 
</P>
<P>
It developed that the league would nail George for offering illegal incentives, 
and his $10 rewards for napping were abolished, which was just as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're napping," a player told him, "and you call to check, you wake us up 
from the nap, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you able to hurl some experience at Clemson?" Allen is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Our starting defensive line has yet to play a down in college," he replies. 
"Our guys are all from junior college and high school." 
</P>
<P>
"And your quarterback?" 
</P>
<P>
"He has yet to play a college game, too." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't surprising that on Saturday morning before the Clemson game, George 
should arrange prayer services for his club. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFL, he always arranged such services on Sunday morning. George isn't 
especially religious, nor is he sure God concerns himself with football. 
</P>
<P>
But in case he does, George wants him on his side. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you feel the opposing coach will try to run up big numbers on you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he doesn't have the chance," he answers. "We have put in a lot of hard 
work to stop this team. I haven't been going home. I have been sleeping at a 
hotel near our practice field." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on George's debut against Clemson, you recall the reporter doing an 
interview at 5 in the morning with a man about to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"What is your feeling?" the reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
The guy answered: "It's a hell of a way to start the day."

<P>
East Germany, making its final appearance in international sports, and 
Britain's dominant men's team, led by Linford Christie and Steve Backley, each 
won two gold medals at the European track and field championships Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The East German victories, by sprinter Katrin Krabbe and long jumper Heike 
Drechsler, were the country's second and third, all by women, on the second day 
of the six-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
The East German women won their first gold Monday, when Astrid Kumbernuss upset 
world record-holder and Olympic champion Natalya Lisovskaya of the Soviet Union 
in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, after unification expected later this year, East Germany and West 
Germany will be competing under one flag. 
</P>
<P>
Krabbe, 20, the 1988 world junior champion, never trailed in leading an East 
German sweep in the 100-meter dash. Her time of 10.89 seconds matched her 
personal best and was the third-fastest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Silke Moeller, the 1987 world champion at 100 and 200 meters, finished second 
in 11.10 and Kerstin Behrendt was third in 11.17. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller said that Krabbe "cannot be beaten at this moment. She is currently so 
superior that sometimes we feel helpless." 
</P>
<P>
"The merge will increase the competition for the (single) German team," Krabbe 
said. "That will even improve our results." 
</P>
<P>
Drechsler, 25, making a comeback after becoming a mother, proved she still is a 
world-class competitor by winning the long jump at 23 feet 11 1/2 inches, the 
second-best in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Drechsler said she was particularly moved because her husband and son, Toni, 
were in the stands, and it was the first time she competed in the presence of 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
Christie salvaged a bad season and overcame a bad start in winning the men's 
100 in a wind-aided 10.00, and Backley, the world javelin record-holder at 
298-6, won at 286-5. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to be back in good condition again," said Christie, who has 
been troubled by injuries throughout the season. "I had a slow start, but I 
felt strong and knew I was going to have a fantastic race. This gold proves 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The day's other gold medal went to Pavol Blazek of Czechoslovakia in the men's 
20-kilometer walk in 1 hour 22 minutes 5 seconds.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: BUS BROUGHT GRANADA HILLS CONSISTENCY IN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derrick Stewart, Brett Washington and Robert Haywood came to Granada Hills High 
two years ago as sophomores, unannounced and unknown. They showed up during the 
first week of practice right off the bus that brought them to the Valley each 
morning from the Dorsey High attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
They were so new that during the first few weeks of practice, Coach Darryl 
Stroh had trouble remembering their names. 
</P>
<P>
Now seniors, they have helped Granada Hills remain one of the area's most 
consistent winners. And this season, two of the three will play even bigger 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a Times All-Valley defensive back as a junior, will start at tailback. 
Last year, he gained 82 yards in 11 carries in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
Haywood, a three-year starter in the secondary, will play for the first time at 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, whose bruising play at linebacker earned him Times Valley Lineman 
of the Year honors as a junior, again will start at fullback. Last season, he 
gained 1,156 yards and averaged 6.96 yards a carry. He has 1,772 yards and is 
expected to break the school career mark for rushing (2,062 yards, set by 
Khalid Ali in 1985-86) by season's end. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are any more guys like these out there, we'll take them," said Tom 
Harp, who has joined Stroh as Highlander co-coach. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer forays at 4-A: Last spring, coaches representing most of the 49 schools 
in the City Section voted to reduce the 4-A Division from 16 to 12 teams -- the 
eight in the Northwest Valley Conference, plus Banning, Carson, Crenshaw and 
Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
All 12 teams will qualify for the playoffs, meaning there will be some repeat 
matchups in the postseason. Granada Hills, for instance, will play eight 4-A 
teams during the regular season. In addition to its seven conference games, 
Granada Hills will play defending 4-A champion Dorsey on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
There is something to be said for familiarity, but there are disadvantages too. 
Last season, the Highlanders were knocked out of the playoffs by El Camino 
Real, a team they had beaten in conference play. In 1987, Granada Hills shocked 
Carson in the 4-A title game after losing -- in lopsided fashion -- to the 
Colts in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real tough to beat a team twice," Harp said. "And it takes something away 
from the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get a group of kids up for a team they already beat. I know that 
if we hadn't played Carson (in the regular season), we probably wouldn't have 
beaten them." 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders are not alone: On Sept. 28, Kennedy will play Crenshaw and San 
Fernando will battle Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Artificial intelligence: In preparation for its season opener Thursday against 
Kahuku High on the artificial turf of Honolulu's Aloha Stadium, the Crespi 
football team conducted practice at East Los Angeles College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi Coach Tim Lins said that the workout at ELAC, the site of the field 
hockey competition during the 1984 Olympic Games, was the first time many of 
his players had ever played on artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the kids bring the turf shoes and they ran around out there for about 
three hours," Lins said. "We noticed that the ball bounces more off the turf 
and is a lot livelier. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's something that's just good to be aware of." 
</P>
<P>
While most of the players agreed that they were quicker on artificial turf than 
on a grass field, there were mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't like it," wide receiver Ryan Kieling said. "It's harder 
on your knees and didn't give too much." 
</P>
<P>
Said defensive back Bill Canalez: "I liked it. You just have to make sure to 
pick up your feet when you make breaks or else it's real easy to trip and fall 
on your face." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons slowed: Westlake Coach Jim Benkert's plan for Seamus Gibbons in the 
Warriors' offense was delayed after Gibbons underwent arthroscopic knee surgery 
three weeks ago. He practiced for the first time Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons (5-foot-10, 170 pounds) led the team with 573 receiving yards last year 
and is expected to fill Luke Crawford's position as Westlake's multipurpose 
back. Crawford accounted for more than 1,000 yards a year ago but has 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons, who will line up at wide receiver, tailback, and wingback, will 
participate in nonleague games and is expected to be at full speed in time for 
Westlake's Sept. 27 league opener against Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey returns: Kris Kirksey, who rushed for 670 yards in 1988 as a sophomore 
tailback at Camarillo, has returned from a knee injury that sidelined him the 
latter part of that season and the entire 1989 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, whose knee was never surgically repaired, transferred to Simi Valley 
last year and reinjured the knee playing baseball last spring. Kirksey's 
younger brother, Tim, is the Pioneers' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's out there but is taking it easy because of the knee," first-year Coach 
Stan Quina said. "We're keeping a close eye on him too."

YOUTH MOVEMENT UNDER WAY AT BUENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in his seven years as a head coach, Buena High's Rick Scott 
will turn to the freshman class for varsity football players. In fact, Scott 
has used only one sophomore on the varsity in his career, but his reach into 
the ninth grade already has garnered surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
George Keiaho and Shaun Popkin probably will play in the backfield together at 
some point this season, although Buena's opener against Westlake at Ventura 
High has been ruled out. Keiaho is only 14 years old and won't be eligible 
under state age-limit rules until he turns 15, which will happen before the 
team's second game, Sept. 14 at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Keiaho, 5-foot-10 and 185 pounds, is from Fiji and had only one year of youth 
football experience before he joined the Buena team during the summer. The late 
start has hindered his ability to understand the offense, but Scott raves about 
the tailback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a man-child," Scott said. "Everyone who saw him this summer said he had 
to be 21 or 22 years old. But he can carry the load. He's got great natural 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Popkin, 15, is 6-foot and 185 pounds. He has worked out at fullback and 
linebacker, although his progress has been slowed by his having missed practice 
time because he was showing his prize bull at an area fair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fun having them in practice," Scott said. "Every time one of my guys 
misses a tackle against them I get all over them about letting a freshman beat 
them. It's sure created a lot of interest."

TORNADOES KILL 23, FLATTEN 100 HOMES IN ILLINOIS

CREST HILL, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most powerful series of tornadoes in this area in more than two decades 
tore a path of death and destruction across suburbs southwest of Chicago 
Tuesday afternoon, killing at least 23 people and flattening 100 homes, an 
apartment complex, a church and a high school in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Four separate tornadoes spawned by a hot, muggy storm cell touched down amid 
the subdivisions and cornfields in the vicinity of Joliet, about 30 miles 
outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals reported more than 280 people injured, many of them critically. 
Officials said they expected the number of deaths and injuries to rise through 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. James R. Thompson activated two Illinois National Guard units 
to help police maintain order and restore public services. As of late Tuesday, 
two people had been arrested for looting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the twisters slammed into the Cedar Woods Apartment Complex in Crest 
Hill about 3:40 p.m., knocking some three-story brick buildings to the ground 
and stripping the top two floors off others. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said they pulled several bodies from the rubble and were 
frantically searching for more victims as daylight faded. Some victims were 
thrown from buildings by the force of the storm and landed more than 200 yards 
away in a cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It was total devastation; it looked like a bomb had hit," said one fireman who 
helped pull bodies from the field. He said most of the dead were clad only in 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary Immaculate Church in Plainfield was almost completely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The storm mangled power and telephone lines and cut vital services to tens of 
thousands of residents in the area. It caused numerous traffic accidents on 
Interstate 55 as high winds tossed dozens of cars and trucks off the road. At 
least six people were injured in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Downed power lines sparked several small fires, officials said. Residents in 
some affected areas were warned not to drink tap water. 
</P>
<P>
At least two deaths were reported at Plainfield High School, which was hit 
point-blank by one of the tornadoes only a day before the beginning of the 
regular school year. At the time, several teachers and administrators were 
inside the building preparing for the start of classes, and members of the 
football and women's volleyball teams were practicing. 
</P>
<P>
The students raced inside the structure just moments before the twister smacked 
into it, blowing the roof off and toppling many walls. Miraculously, none of 
the youngsters were among those reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some very short warnings," said Steve Schernerhorn, a school 
administrator. "We immediately took cover . . . . There is no school left . . . 
. All the houses in front of the school are pretty much gone." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, 16-year-old Guy Allton watched from his home as the school crumbled. 
"We went outside and there were picnic tables blowing past our faces and 
stuff," Allton told Associated Press. "Everything was messed up. Everything on 
James Street is totaled. Lots and lots of people hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Candi Vance, another Plainfield student, was not at school when the storm hit 
but barely escaped with her life anyway. The 16-year-old Vance was visiting her 
grandmother in the Lilly Cash subdivision in Plainfield when a tornado swooped 
out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The two women had just begun to scramble down the stairs to the basement when 
the roof and much of the rest of the house collapsed. "It came down; the steps 
fell on top of us," Vance recalled. "All I could see was the sky. There's 
nothing left . . . . No one can believe we made it out alive." 
</P>
<P>
Vance was treated at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet for a twisted ankle 
and bruised bones in her knee. Her grandmother suffered cuts on one leg from 
the knee to the ankle and was bleeding badly when she was brought into the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, huge traffic jams filled the roads throughout the southwestern 
suburbs as commuters returning from work tried to navigate through darkened 
streets obstructed by floodwaters and debris. Police roadblocks and the lack of 
stoplights added to the congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people with injuries ranging from minor cuts to serious head 
wounds were shuttled by ambulances to hospitals in Joliet. One of the 
facilities was so overwhelmed that it set up an emergency treatment center in 
its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities set up several shelters in area churches and schools for those who 
had lost their homes or were having trouble coping with the lack of 
electricity. Clair Swan, superintendent of schools in suburban Shorewood, said 
all three of his district's schools would be used as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"At least 1,000 people, maybe more, will sleep here tonight," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents also opened their doors to those in need. A local radio 
station in Joliet was broadcasting the names and addresses of residents who had 
called in with offers to put up the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Area businesses also offered relief, including a bed-and-mattress shop that 
said it would let displaced people come in and sleep on the floor samples.

BUSH ASKS SUPPORT OF CONGRESS; COSTS DOUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
HOME FRONT: LAWMAKERS APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT'S FIRM ACTION IN THE GULF BUT ASK 
WHO WILL PAY THE BILL. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush appealed to members of Congress on Tuesday for political support 
for his deployment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf as the Pentagon doubled 
its estimate of the early cost of the military buildup to $2.5 billion, 
triggering new concerns about the huge financial burden that lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 100 Congress members in a special briefing with his top 
Cabinet members, Bush declared that "meeting the crisis in the Persian Gulf is 
not something that I or this Administration can do by ourselves. We can only 
succeed if all of us -- executive and legislative, Republican and Democrat -- 
work together." 
</P>
<P>
In the hourlong private session, lawmakers congratulated the President for his 
firm action but, citing concerns at home, questioned who will bear the mounting 
costs of what could be a long operation. 
</P>
<P>
The members of Congress also urged Bush to outline more clearly his objectives 
in taking on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and pointedly suggested more 
Administration emphasis on energy conservation to make the United States less 
at risk from disruptions of gulf oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The session -- the first broad exchange between the President and Congress 
since the crisis erupted Aug. 2 -- delivered both a flag-waving endorsement for 
the Administration and a warning on serious potential flash points if the 
overseas commitment drags on. 
</P>
<P>
"The President got high marks for what he has done and the way he has done 
them," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). "There was 
concern, and there will continue to be concern, about where we go from here." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting said some lawmakers burst into applause when Sen. 
Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), in an impassioned praise of Administration action, 
declared: "Whatever happens, Mr. President, let's do it right. Let's win." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), however, told the President that he and 
other lawmakers who came of age during the Vietnam War era have a different 
perspective and want to know "what we're doing in Saudi Arabia" and how long 
the commitment will last. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, taking questions from a podium in an Old Executive Office Building 
auditorium so hot that lawmakers jokingly compared it to Saudi Arabia, won 
praise for his direct responses but generally did not stray from previous 
public remarks, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when pressed, they reported, the President declined to say whether the 
United States would accept an outcome in which Hussein withdrew from Kuwait but 
maintained his power and his military might. 
</P>
<P>
The new Pentagon assessment of early costs of Operation Desert Shield was 
announced at a Defense Department briefing earlier in the day. The revised 
$2.5-billion estimate for operations through the end of September -- up from 
$1.2 billion -- was attributed largely to the call-up of tens of thousands of 
reservists and rising fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Administration told members of Congress it has assembled a new 
$3-billion arms sale package for Saudi Arabia that will provide the desert 
kingdom with 24 F-15 fighters, which are among the United States' most advanced 
jet aircraft. The reports sparked expressions of concern from members of 
Congress worried that the equipment would upset the long-term military balance 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the new Pentagon estimate nor the Saudi arms sale was addressed at the 
Tuesday meeting, which interrupted the vacations of the President and dozens of 
lawmakers for the first formal briefing to Congress since the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But after reporters were ushered out of the room, participants said, the 
lawmakers made clear that, however pleased they might have been with the 
President's performance, it is the cost of the operation to American taxpayers 
that is most on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening question that set a broader pattern, Rep. David E. Bonior 
(D-Mich.) praised Bush for his "impeccable leadership" but noted that his 
constituents are complaining that the Japanese, the Australians and others are 
not doing their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
The recurrent issue, said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), is whether U.S. 
allies in Europe and the Middle East will carry their fair share of the burden 
"or whether they are just going to sit on the grandstand cheering us on." 
</P>
<P>
According to participants, Bush assured the Congress members that Japan and 
Saudi Arabia will, in the next few days, unveil plans of their own to help pay 
for the international operation. 
</P>
<P>
But after he was again pressed on the burden-sharing question, Bush finally 
declared that he "he would hope that the United States would never be accused 
of being a mercenary army," said Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want other people to pay to put our kids on the line," California 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) told reporters, paraphrasing Bush's 
remarks. "We're doing it because it's right." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress warned after the session that the huge cost of the 
operation would all but evaporate an expected "peace dividend" and could 
severely limit projected budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
One lawmaker, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), said the potential cost to other 
programs is so severe that he urged Bush to levy a new tax specifically to fund 
the Persian Gulf mission. Such a measure, he said, would make clear the 
nation's willingness to operate on a "pay-as-you-go basis." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush had not responded to the proposal, and other Democratic leaders 
indicated that they regarded the idea as premature. 
</P>
<P>
In another major area of deep concern, lawmakers urged Bush to provide to the 
American people what Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) called "as fine an 
explanation of our presence (in the Middle East) as can be produced." 
</P>
<P>
Some members warned more specifically that the President cannot count on 
long-term national support for a military operation justified on grounds of 
deterring an attack on Saudi Arabia and restoring the sovereignty of Kuwait, 
the current Administration explanation for the action. 
</P>
<P>
But participants in the session said Bush steadfastly refused to discuss 
whether his goals in the crisis include the removal of Saddam Hussein. Instead, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III obliquely noted that the United States 
hopes to create "a balance of authority" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Lugar and others said they were not satisfied by the vague answers. But 
Metzenbaum said it was "understandable" that Bush would not want to telegraph 
his hand.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what would be a dramatic shift in policy, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
announced late Tuesday that all foreign women and children being held in Iraq 
are free to leave as of today. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by Baghdad Television and the state-run Iraqi News 
Agency, said the women and children should "enjoy the freedom of either staying 
in Iraq or leaving whenever they wish." It came less than an hour after Hussein 
appeared on Iraqi TV with about two dozen of the hostages, one of whom, an 
American, appealed to him to grant them their freedom as a gesture of 
"sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that Hussein made his decision after he was "deeply 
affected" by the desire expressed by some hostages to have the freedom of 
staying or leaving. At the same time, a statement from the ruling Revolutionary 
Command Council said Hussein acted "to preserve the image of Arabs," according 
to the official news agency. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said of the announcement: "We hope 
it's true, but we haven't confirmed it yet. They've made several promises over 
the past weeks, and we've had our hopes dashed." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, visiting the Finnish 
capital of Helsinki, also responded cautiously to the Iraqi announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We should wait and see whether it occurs, but they should never have been 
detained in the first place," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Western embassies contacted in Baghdad late Tuesday night said they had 
not been officially notified of the Iraqi decision. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how many women and children were among the foreign hostages in 
Iraq, or whether the order may also apply to foreigners in Kuwait. Of the 
12,000 Western hostages in both countries, about 500 in Iraq and 2,500 in 
Kuwait are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
If implemented as ordered today, the decree would apply to the women and 
children being held at strategic facilities throughout Iraq, as well as those 
who have continued to live in their homes in Baghdad but were barred from 
leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
During his hourlong session Tuesday with the hostages, the second in a week, 
Hussein also challenged President Bush and Thatcher to an internationally 
televised debate on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Iraqi president said he is willing to talk face to face with Bush, 
top aides indicated in interviews with The Times that Hussein will not consider 
the withdrawal of his troops from Kuwait as a negotiating point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sick, and it doesn't even deserve a response," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said when asked about the suggested debate. The 
spokesman for Thatcher described the offer as "pure gimmickry." 
</P>
<P>
Several Americans who viewed the hostage telecast in Baghdad on Tuesday 
described it as "surreal," "rambling" and "rewriting the basic principles of 
modern logic." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the broadcast -- which began with Hussein patting several Western 
girls on the head and wishing a young girl named Rachel a happy birthday -- 
focused on his lengthy opening speech, in which he accused the West of 
"choking" Iraq through a naval blockade and economic sanctions that appear to 
be having an increasing impact in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
He implied he would attack those American allies geographically closest to Iraq 
-- presumably Israel -- if the United States launches any military strike 
against Iraq. And he cast the entire crisis in the context of "America's 
invasion of our holy lands" and a military buildup designed solely "to invade 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages appearing with Hussein were three to five Americans, as well 
as Britons and French. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to one of three questions raised by the hostages themselves, Hussein 
said, "I am prepared now for direct talks and dialogue with Mr. Bush and Mrs. 
Thatcher immediately, and, if they so wished, and, to let the world know 
everything, let us have the debate between me and them on the television for 
the whole world to see." 
</P>
<P>
On the hostage issue itself, Hussein continued to describe the hundreds of 
Westerners being held in a "human shield" at military and civilian 
installations throughout Iraq as heroes who were preventing war. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time, he conceded that the role they are playing in history 
could be an unpleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
"From a human point of view, I am as much in pain as you are," he told the 
hostage group that ringed the large room Tuesday. "Let me say how painful for 
me it is to see a situation come about that has put you where you are now. I 
wish that your stay in a manner of forced hospitality, let's say, will not be 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages who were allowed to ask questions politely, but firmly, 
attempted to argue for their release. 
</P>
<P>
"You claim to be a humanitarian in search of a peaceful solution to this 
crisis," said Kevin Bazner, an American whose identity was later confirmed by 
his sister, Patricia Heath of Farmington Hills, Mich., after she saw the 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Bazner then suggested that the president make a gesture "to impress upon our 
government and the rest of the world your sincerity in reaching a peaceful 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, as a hostage, I would suggest this, as others in the room have, 
perhaps the gesture of sincerity be the release of all women and children," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein responded: "The proposal that you have made is only to be expected from 
a man because men, the first thing they have in mind is to free women and 
children somehow. But the situation is so difficult that it would not allow 
human beings like the Iraqis to make the kind of decision they would love to 
make." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jasim, who attended the session Tuesday, 
declined to disclose its location in an interview with The Times shortly before 
the broadcast. But he added, "It was the kind of place we could bring all these 
people together to meet with the president." 
</P>
<P>
In footage that was apparently edited from the telecast, Hussein told the 
Westerners that in the event of an American military strike, they would be 
placed in bomb shelters at the facilities where they are being held, according 
to Jasim. 
</P>
<P>
He also reinforced Iraq's continuing refusal to negotiate with the West on the 
future of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is not a symbol. Kuwait is part of Iraq," he said in explaining 
Tuesday's announcement that Kuwait is now Iraq's 19th province. "So Kuwait was 
brought back to the old Iraq forever." 
</P>
<P>
Jasim also predicted that America will ultimately back down in the military 
standoff in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans will blink," he declared. "You have no cause to die for here. We 
are stronger than you." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. officials in Washington refused Tuesday to disclose the name of 
an American hostage who died Monday until they received confirmation of his 
identity. Officials in Washington said they were first informed of the death 
late Monday. "We've gotten one phone call. They told us an American had died, 
and they gave us a city," a State Department source said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler, speaking at a department briefing, said the death of the hostage 
"underscores the barbaric nature" of Iraq's current policies. 
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that over the past three weeks, U.S. officials have given Iraqi 
authorities a list of 15 American citizens being held in Iraq or Kuwait who 
have medical problems and should be permitted to return home. The 15 include 
pregnant women with complications, diabetics, cancer patients and heart 
patients. The man who died was not among the 15 on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, there has been no response to our repeated requests that these 
individuals be allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also disclosed that Iraqi officials have told the U.S. 
Embassy in Baghdad that they plan to place new restrictions upon American 
diplomats in Iraq in response to the curbs that the Bush Administration imposed 
Monday upon Iraqi diplomats in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the State Department expelled two-thirds of the Iraqi diplomatic 
staff in Washington, cutting back on the size of the staff from 55 to 19. The 
remaining 19 diplomats were barred from traveling more than 25 miles outside of 
Washington, and the State Department said their use of embassy funds would be 
"carefully controlled." 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have told us (the restrictions) would include reduction of our 
embassy staff in Baghdad and unspecified restrictions on available funds," 
Tutwiler said. ". . . Assuming that they have taken these steps in compliance 
with international law, we would be prepared to respond accordingly, and, of 
course, would be prepared to get our people out of Iraq if Iraqi officials will 
let them go." 
</P>
<P>
Between Monday and Tuesday, State Department officials said, nine more private 
Americans were rounded up by the Iraqi government, six of them in Iraq and 
three in Kuwait. By the State Department's count, that brings the number of 
private Americans believed to be under Iraqi detention to 70.

2 NEW MURDERS SPAWN FEAR OF SERIAL KILLER IN FLORIDA; 
</P>

CRIME: THE MUTILATED BODIES OF THREE WOMEN STUDENTS HAD BEEN FOUND EARLIER. 
COLLEGE CAMPUS IS IN AN UPROAR.

<P>
A young man and woman found slain near the University of Florida Tuesday 
morning were linked by police to the mutilation killings of three women 
students earlier this week, touching off a wave of fear that a serial killer is 
stalking the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear this part of the country has some maniac on the loose," University 
of Florida President John Lombardi said during a staff meeting. "It reminds us 
of a natural catastrophe. The killer is selecting victims by criteria that are 
not clear to us." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a serial or lust killer at large," said Gainesville Police Chief 
Wayland Clifton. "We have every reason to believe that all five murders are 
connected and committed by either one or two murderers. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the young man and woman were found together Tuesday morning in an 
apartment near the campus, not far from where the mutilated bodies of two women 
students were discovered Sunday. Another woman had been discovered early 
Monday. News reports said her head had been chopped off. 
</P>
<P>
The Gainesville Sun reported Tuesday that the mutilations provided police with 
the connections between the first two discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that anybody that 
commits homicide using mutilation is a pretty sick individual, and it's 
somebody we want to get off the streets very badly," said Lt. Spencer Mann, 
Alachua County sheriff's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Martinez ordered 50 state troopers and Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement agents and two crime labs to Gainesville. FBI agents joined the 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The 34,000-student campus was in an uproar Tuesday, with phone lines jammed and 
some parents arriving to take their children home. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically I'm just scared," said Susan Zarycki, 18, from Tampa. "I hope 
classes are suspended so we can go home." Anna Bendeck, 23, from Ft. Myers, 
said: "I'm thinking about leaving anyway. What's worrying me? The threat of 
getting killed at night in my apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Both students said they were demanding more security for their apartment 
complex. "We don't walk alone even during the day. I don't feel safe any more. 
I don't even say hi to people," said Bendeck. 
</P>
<P>
Art Markley, 59, of Miami, flew to Gainesville to pick up his 20-year-old 
daughter Linda, whom he had just driven to school on Sunday. She had moved into 
an apartment directly across the street from where two women students were 
slain. "Her mother is very upset, crying all night in sympathy for the murdered 
children and in fear for ours," he said. "Imagine bringing a kid up and then 
sending her off to college to be murdered." 
</P>
<P>
The two latest victims were identified as Tracy Inez Paules and a 23-year-old 
friend, Manuel R. Tobada, both of Miami. Tobada had just been accepted at 
nearby Santa Fe Community College and was planning to study architecture, a 
friend, Eric Dunham, 22, of Sarasota, told the Associated Press. Paules, whose 
age was not available, reportedly was pursuing a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, authorities found two victims -- freshmen Christina P. Powell, 17, 
of Jacksonville and Sonya Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach, who had shared a 
townhouse apartment. 
</P>
<P>
One victim was nude and the other was partly clothed, said police Lt. Sadie 
Darnell. 
</P>
<P>
Eight hours later, deputies found the body of Christa L. Hoyt, 18, a student at 
Santa Fe Community College and a records clerk at the sheriff's office. 
Deputies checked on her when she failed to report for her midnight shift. 
</P>
<P>
More than three-fourths of all University of Florida students live off campus. 
On Tuesday, university authorities urged students to lock their doors, travel 
in groups and telephone their anxious parents. 
</P>
<P>
All nine of the state university's branches have beefed up security, Pat 
Reardon, the chief spokesman for the state university system, told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon said the university was considering setting up a temporary communal 
dorm in an auditorium where frightened students could spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Classes were being held as scheduled, but the murders were the main topic of 
conversations, including comparisons to serial killer Ted Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're all saying. It's another Ted Bundy on the loose," said Jana 
Walters, 18, a freshman from Longwood. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy was executed in Florida's electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989, after 
murdering dozens of young women, including two Florida State University 
sorority sisters in Tallahassee in a 1978 rampage. The Florida State Prison 
where he died is about 25 miles from here. 
</P>
<P>
Three University of Florida students who live across the street from the 
apartment complex where the two bodies were found Tuesday said they were going 
home to Key West. 
</P>
<P>
"We're horrified, we're scared, and we're going home at least temporarily until 
this thing blows over," said Lydia Blanco, 22, who lives with her sister, 
Ileana Blanco, 20, and Lauren Bacle, 19. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disconcerting," said student Rob Dye. "I was going to walk home 
myself last night but my best friend convinced me not to. I'm glad I didn't 
walk alone -- and I'm going to stick with friends." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Colucci said he made the five-hour drive here from his home in Davi to stay 
with his daughter Jennifer, an 18-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to be with my child and protect her as much as possible. If they 
don't catch someone by this weekend, I'm taking her home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Krupezaki, 21, a University of Florida student from Miami, said "with what 
happened last year with Tiffany Sessions, everybody is afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Sessions, a 20-year-old University of Florida student, vanished Feb. 9, 1989, 
after leaving her apartment to go jogging. No trace of her has been found.

PRESSURE INCREASES TO DENY PROPONENTS FREE AIR TIME

California voters don't go to the polls until November, but a ballot measure 
that would substantially increase taxes on beer, wine and liquor may well be 
decided in the next few weeks in the boardrooms and corporate offices of the 
state's radio and television stations. 
</P>
<P>
As a major part of its strategy to defeat Proposition 134, the tax increase 
proposal, the alcoholic beverage industry and advertising businesses that serve 
it are putting strong pressure on broadcasters to deny the measure's promoters 
critical free advertising time. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the industry-financed Taxpayers for Common Sense threatened to 
withdraw its political advertising from any station that gave opponents free 
time. Now the influential American Assn. of Advertising Agencies has weighed in 
on the side of the industry, urging stations to deny requests for free air time 
from consumer and public-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give free time to the Proposition 134 promoters, the revenue must be 
recaptured elsewhere, meaning higher prices for all other advertisers," said 
Robert Stephens, vice president of the association's western region wrote the 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Because a key part of the promoters' strategy is obtaining as much free 
commercial time under the Federal Communications Commission's fairness doctrine 
as possible, the Proposition 134 sponsors say broadcasters' reaction could 
determine the outcome of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"They (alcoholic beverage interests) not only want a David and Goliath battle, 
they want to muzzle David," said Jim Shultz, a consumer activist and adviser to 
Californians for Yes on 134. "In many ways (free air time is) the only hope 
that we have of getting our message to the voters. If they can keep the 134 
message from radio and television, then it doesn't leave us a lot more other 
avenues." 
</P>
<P>
Others see the industry's tactics, if successful, as setting a precedent that 
could affect future campaigns and efforts by public-interest, consumer and 
environmental organizations to pass initiatives. If broadcasters accede to the 
industry's wishes this time, they say, they will be more likely to do the same 
in future campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, media consultant for Californians for Yes on 134, said: "What the 
liquor industry is really doing is blazing the trail for any industry 
organization that wants to influence public opinion by attempting to ensure 
there will not be an evenhanded look at issues in the broadcast arena." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the FCC's fairness doctrine has been the lifeblood of 
campaigns by public-interest groups to pass initiatives. Free radio and 
television advertising helped make the difference in successful efforts in 1988 
to pass Proposition 99, a measure that increased taxes on cigarettes, and 
Proposition 103, an initiative designed to cut insurance rates and overhaul the 
regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
The fairness doctrine requires that when "controversial issues of public 
importance" are on the ballot, both sides must be fairly covered by the 
broadcast media. Attorneys say that means whenever one side of an issue 
receives substantial air time through paid advertising, the other side must 
also be presented through public affairs programming, news coverage or free 
advertising time. 
</P>
<P>
Many broadcasters, particularly those without ample resources, meet fairness 
doctrine requirements by agreeing to run a certain number of advertisements 
without charge for the side that cannot afford to buy the air time. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the alcoholic beverage industry is arguing that the promoters of 
Proposition 134 are "financed by wealthy individuals" and intend to mount a 
$1-million advertising assault just before November. To back up their claims, 
they note that similar tactics were used by groups that promoted the cigarette 
tax hike and some of those same groups are also involved in the campaign to 
increase alcoholic beverage taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously from our standpoint it doesn't make sense for our opposition to get 
commercial time for free when they will have money to pay for it in the last 
weeks of the campaign," said Rick Manter, executive director of Taxpayers for 
Common Sense. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy said the campaign initially raised nearly $1 million, but those funds 
were exhausted by signature-gathering efforts to qualify for the ballot. He 
said the campaign has little hope of raising more than enough money to "pay our 
bills and meet our payroll." He said emergency room doctors have provided 
substantial funds for the campaign's early efforts, but their association has 
advised the campaign that they have no more funds to give.

TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dawn was sneaking over a distant ridge, and 50 miles due south of Bagdad, Maj. 
Brian Robertson of the U.S. Marine Corps was crouching like a quarterback in a 
huddle, diagraming a play in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got up here is an enemy company dug in," Robertson said. "A 
Soviet-style strong-point" -- three trench lines protected by a forward machine 
gun emplacement. 
</P>
<P>
Just the sort of defensive posture, Robertson said, that Saddam Hussein's 
Soviet-trained army might employ -- if this were not just a drill, if the 
American forces were 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq, not the isolated hamlet 
of Bagdad, Calif., on Interstate 40. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the desert, and temperatures here would eventually climb to 106 
degrees Tuesday. There were other important elements of reality in this little 
war game: the mortar shells, the machine gun fire, the M-16 rounds. No one 
would be shooting at the Marines -- the enemy here was a phantom -- but 
mistakes happen and "friendly fire" could prove deadly. 
</P>
<P>
As American and Iraqi forces confront each other in the Persian Gulf, such 
"live-fire" desert warfare training at the massive Marine Air-Ground Combat 
Center at Twentynine Palms 150 miles east of Los Angeles is taking on a special 
urgency. Marine commanders say it is not quite as hot or nearly as humid as 
Saudi Arabia, where temperatures reached 108 in the capital, Riyadh, on 
Tuesday. But American commanders are counting on this Marine base that trains 
50,000 troops each year as well as the Army's Ft. Irwin as substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
There is no substitute, military men say, for actual combat. Live-fire drills, 
with their inherent dangers, at least provide some semblance of the 
life-or-death tension of battle, Marine commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
"Combat is chaotic, so we train for chaos," said Col. John Moffett, a 24-year 
veteran who served two tours in Vietnam and oversaw Tuesday's drills. "So we 
try to create chaos -- the smells, the noise, the explosions." 
</P>
<P>
Troops also train in "force-on-force" exercises -- a war game in which they 
shoot blanks and use infrared lasers and special jackets, and where "kills" are 
noted by the sound of a beeper. But live-fire, Moffett said, has a deeper 
"psychological edge. . . . You don't want to create a friendly casualty." 
</P>
<P>
So 120 members of Capt. Rob McLenagan's G Company moved out at dawn, 
disappearing in shallow ravines as they silently neared the enemy stronghold, 
one platoon covering another. Tactical specialists such as Robertson followed 
the units, choreographing a battle that couldn't be lost. 
</P>
<P>
The first mortar rounds echoed off a ridgeline. From the start, there were 
problems. The mortar was off target, and a cease-fire was ordered because 
shells were falling too close to the advancing Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments were made, and before long the Marines had taken out the machine 
gun nest and set up their own machine guns to cover their assault. Robertson 
and other observers would describe counterattacks while tossing "flash-bang" 
grenades to simulate incoming fire. Grenade launchers shot orange smoke bombs 
amid the explosions, machine gun fire and rifle blasts. 
</P>
<P>
G Company broke through a breach in a mine field and accomplished its 
objectives -- but not without suffering some phantom casualties. 
</P>
<P>
If a man screwed up, Moffett explained, he might be tapped on the shoulder and 
informed he was dead. But in this battle, anyway, they would come back to life. 
</P>
<P>
A dead Marine, the colonel explained, won't get enough training.

The battle over money for public schools escalated Tuesday when state

Davis and state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who asked Davis to take 
the action, are "thumbing their nose at the governor," said one Republican 
consultant in the state Assembly who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
But Jay Ziegler, communications director for Davis, replied: "The governor, in 
his budget cuts, has thumbed his nose at Proposition 98." 
</P>
<P>
Before signing the final budget on July 31, Deukmejian cut the 4.8% 
cost-of-living increase included in the Legislature's version of the budget to 
3%. He set aside the difference, which amounted to about $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
This was part of a total of $462 million in sequestered funds to be used later 
to reduce class size and pay for other educational improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, a Democrat, said in a telephone interview that this week he is 
sending about $1.7 billion in the latest periodic payments to the state's 1,100 
school districts and that the checks reflect the full 4.8% increase in basic 
operating support. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relying on a duly authorized certification I received from the state 
Department of Education," Davis said. Unless such certification "is defective 
on its face, and this one was not" the controller added, "I am required to act 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe the governor violated the Constitution" by setting aside 
several hundred million dollars the schools were supposed to receive under 
Proposition 98, "but that is not the legal basis for my action," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98, approved by voters two years ago, guarantees at least 40% of 
the state's General Fund for public schools and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, a Deukmejian spokeswoman said that Davis "has taken ministerial 
actions, based on what (Honig) did," referring to the certification. The 
spokeswoman also said, "We are reviewing other possible future actions." 
</P>
<P>
Many involved in the squabble in the Capitol expect the governor to sue the 
controller in an effort to trim the cost-of-living boost back to 3%, but Davis 
said, "I'm absolutely satisfied my action will withstand legal scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he acted because the school year is rapidly approaching and 
Deukmejian and the Legislature still are fighting over how much money the 
schools should receive. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world doesn't wait for Sacramento," Davis said. "School is about to 
start and they need the money." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, restoration of the full cost-of-living increase would produce 
about $40 million during the year and allow the school district to balance its 
$3-billion budget, budget director Henry Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the controller for taking action to make a regular school program 
possible," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen DiMarco, president of the California School Boards Assn., said school 
districts run some risk if they spend the extra money Davis will be sending 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of 'iffy' money for the districts," DiMarco warned. "Can they 
count on it all to the end of the school year?" 
</P>
<P>
Honig acknowledged that the schools could lose the difference between the 4.8% 
and the 3% boost if the governor should sue over the matter and prevail. 
</P>
<P>
But the state superintendent said, "I think we have strong constitutional 
authority to do this" and predicted that a legal action by Deukmejian would 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor still is trying to negotiate an agreement on the 
disputed money with key legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Deukmejian proposed unfreezing $97 million of the Proposition 98 
money he has set aside and allowing schools to use it for a few specific 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
However, that idea has gained little support in the Legislature and this week a 
new plan is being discussed. This one would send about $200 million in 
unrestricted money to school districts immediately and another $150 million 
next spring if economic conditions permit. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also includes $110 million to $120 million for class size 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
However, the stumbling block is that the governor wants the $200 million in 
immediate money to be on a one-time basis only, not built into the schools' 
permanent funding base. 
</P>
<P>
This is not acceptable to the coalition of education groups that has been 
negotiating with the governor's representatives and with key legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"It is imprudent to spend one-time money when your costs are ongoing," DiMarco 
said. "Our coalition is very firm that the money has to go into the base." 
</P>
<P>
Whether this problem can be resolved before the Legislature adjourns at 
midnight Friday remains a mystery.

FISHING: JUDGE ORDERS EMBARGO UNTIL FOREIGN FLEETS PROVE THEY ARE REDUCING THE 
NUMBER OF DOLPHINS THEY KILL. MEXICO WOULD BE AMONG NATIONS MOST AFFECTED.

<P>
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Bush Administration to impose an 
immediate embargo on imports of tuna caught by foreign fleets until they prove 
they are reducing the number of dolphins they kill. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, though certain to be 
appealed, affects at least five nations: Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, Ecuador and 
Vanuatu. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson accused the Commerce Department of failing to enforce a 1988 
provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act by not demanding that the 
countries prove they are cutting their dolphin kills to levels comparable to 
the U.S. tuna fleet's so-called incidental take. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply put," Henderson wrote, "the continued slaughter and destruction of 
these innocent victims of the economics of fishing constitutes an irreparable 
injury to us all, and certainly to the mammals whom Congress intended to 
protect." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson ordered Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to impose an embargo 
immediately until the Commerce Department produces proof that foreign fleets 
have reduced the number of dolphins killed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a stunning rebuke for the government's position," declared David 
Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute, which sued to force the 
federal government to take action against the foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the State Department has been categorically against enforcing these 
embargoes," Phillips continued. "They have put dolphin protection at the bottom 
of the priority list in dealing with these countries." 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys could not be reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 provision in the Marine Mammal Protection Act required that countries 
seeking to export tuna to the United States prove that their dolphin take in 
1989 was no more than two times the number killed by U.S. tuna boats. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was supposed to have determined whether the foreign fleets 
had complied by the end of 1989, Henderson wrote. The act also required that 
exporting countries prove by the end of this year that their 1990 dolphin kill 
is no more than 1.25 times greater than the U.S. fleet's kill. 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson accused the foreign nations and this government of foot-dragging, 
and pointed out that U.S. authorities only received data on the 1989 catch last 
month. The United States has not received any data for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The statute requires a fairly simple calculation," Henderson wrote. "In this 
age of computers, it is difficult to understand why this calculation would be 
so difficult or time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
Should the embargo go into effect, the impact on tuna fisheries in the five 
nations could be dramatic. Phillips estimated that Mexico exports 20,000 tons 
of yellowfin a year to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other nations export less, Phillips said. But he said the Pacific island nation 
of Vanuatu exports 72% of its tuna catch to the United States, while Venezuela 
exports 48% of its tuna to this country. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen long have fished yellowfin tuna by locating herds of dolphin, which 
often swim directly above tuna. To catch the tuna, fishermen set huge purse 
seine nets. When the nets are shut and hauled aboard, large numbers of dolphins 
are killed or maimed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tuna fleet has been phasing out the practice of "setting on dolphins," 
and major domestic canners have stopped buying tuna if the fishing techniques 
used to catch them harm large numbers of dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
Still, foreign fleets continue the practice. Phillips said Mexico has as many 
as 50 ships using purse seine nets. The American dolphin kill in 1989 was 
12,643, down by 36% from the previous year. But a National Marine Fisheries 
Service official recently told Congress that dolphins killed last year by 
foreign tuna fleets rose by more than 40%, to 84,000. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the failure of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to enforce the 1988 provision 
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act "assures the continued slaughter of 
dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
"The statute was intended to use access to the United States market as an 
incentive for foreign nations to reduce marine mammal deaths. The secretary, 
contrary to Congressional intent, has not provided that incentive," the judge 
wrote.

CAMPAIGN ISSUE NOW A $6.1-BILLION CLEANUP PROJECT;

<P>
One of the more notable issues of the 1988 presidential campaign was the 
horrendous pollution of Boston Harbor. George Bush blamed Michael S. Dukakis, 
his Democratic opponent, for allowing the harbor to become the dirtiest in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bush is President, Dukakis is the lame-duck governor, and the 
$6.1-billion harbor cleanup, under federal court supervision, is well under way 
with little help from either of the 1988 presidential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water Resources Agency, created by the Legislature in 1985 
under pressure of several anti-pollution lawsuits, is supervising the cleanup 
-- the largest public works project ever undertaken in New England. U.S. 
District Judge David Mazzone is overseeing the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Major elements of the cleanup plan include upgrading primary sewage treatment 
plants on Nut and Deer islands in the harbor; building new primary and 
secondary treatment facilities on Deer Island; building a plant in Quincy to 
turn sludge into marketable fertilizer pellets; replacing and repairing miles 
of water and sewer pipes, some 80 years old, and controlling combined sewage 
overflow systems, pipes that handle both rainwater and sewage. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, when many other cities were rehabilitating their 
systems, largely with federal funds available under the Clean Water Act, Boston 
was seeking waivers to save money. Now, federal funds have dried up and state 
finances are in such a sorry state that Massachusetts has the lowest bond 
rating in the nation. That means 95% of the costs of cleaning up Boston Harbor 
will be borne by water and sewage ratepayers, who are beginning to wonder 
whether federally mandated secondary treatment is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Annual water and sewer bills are expected to reach $1,200 or more per household 
by the end of the decade, with a big increase next year, when bills will jump 
from an average $330 per household to $400. 
</P>
<P>
Chester Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat who represents a number of communities 
where water and sewer rates are climbing, last year got a bill through Congress 
to fund a National Academy of Sciences study of a controversial proposal to 
treat wastes at the primary level with chemicals, instead of at the secondary 
level with bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Levy, who has directed the Water Resources Agency since 1987, said that 
even if the scientists made a "conclusive finding that secondary treatment is 
not appropriate," Congress would be unlikely to change the law to benefit 
Massachusetts and California. Los Angeles and San Diego also have challenged 
the need for secondary treatment, Levy noted. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Lynch, vice president of Save the Harbor/Save the Bay, an environmental 
advocacy group, said there has been "a noticeable difference" in the 
cleanliness of the harbor this year. She wants the water agency to keep its 
secondary treatment plans. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Bush campaign commercial, "People in Massachusetts were 
embarrassed," Levy said. The water agency confronted the image problem head-on, 
preparing a videotape that began with footage of Bush calling it "the harbor of 
shame." The agency told institutional investors, "OK, here's what you think you 
know about Boston Harbor, and here's what's really happening . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"In a way," Levy said, "Bush did us a favor . . . . It created impetus." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Levy added, "Everybody noticed the inconsistency when he left the 
money out of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
In the budget he presented last January, Bush omitted $20 million scheduled to 
help pay for the cleanup, part of an appropriation arranged by former Speaker 
of the House Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. before he retired. The money was 
eventually restored in conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Ratepayers have already seen some results from the increased fees. Boaters and 
swimmers have reported improvements in the harbor water this year, and there 
have been fewer beach closings. Some swim in the harbor, and others wouldn't 
dare. 
</P>
<P>
Caryl Rivers, a 20-year resident of Winthrop whose back yard ends at the 
harbor, frequently takes a dip. But she does take precautions. She calls 
Winthrop Town Hall to find out the latest coliform count before wading in.

SUNUNU, SHEVARDNADZE DISCUSS MANAGERIAL ISSUES

White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu is in the Soviet Union to swap 
managerial pointers with Kremlin leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, known for his stay-in-touch management style, met with Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss plans for setting up a mechanism 
by which the superpowers can share advice on organizing state agencies, the 
official news agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great believer that, whenever you talk shop with somebody, you can 
learn," Sununu had said before leaving Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, who has not met with reporters since he arrived here Monday, is in the 
second half of an exchange between himself and the man who is roughly his 
counterpart in the Kremlin, Mikhail S. Shkabardnya, who runs the staff at the 
Soviet Council of Ministers, or cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Shkabardnya and his aides visited the White House during the summit meeting in 
June. They expressed interest in the nuts and bolts of the Washington political 
machine, such as how the federal executive and legislative branches interact 
and how President Bush's schedule is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev continued to fine-tune his 
leadership team. On Tuesday, he named the editor in chief of the progressive 
New Times weekly, Vitaly Ignatenko, to be his press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Arkady A. Maslennikov, who had been Gorbachev's spokesman, was appointed 
spokesman for Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairman of the Soviet parliament, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.

<P>
President Bush's efforts to sustain a major military action in the Mideast may 
be impeded by the Administration's failure to get its domestic economic 
policies in order before embarking on a campaign overseas, economists in and 
outside government warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration has been praised widely for quickly lining up its 
diplomatic and military policies in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, 
analysts say it has failed to do the same on the economic front -- a gap that 
could backfire if the stalemate drags on. 
</P>
<P>
If the economy further deteriorates in the midst of the crisis, "a lot of 
people are going to start saying we can't afford this involvement in the Middle 
East," Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, warned. 
</P>
<P>
"And that would weaken the President's hand in dealing with the crisis," 
Bosworth declared. 
</P>
<P>
The escalation of America's military involvement in the Middle East has come at 
a time when the budget-cutting process seems in disarray and when the dollar is 
plunging on world currency markets, largely due to mounting concerns over the 
deterioration in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sharp increase in oil prices resulting from the U.S. embargo on 
oil shipments from Iraq and Kuwait apparently has persuaded both Congress and 
the White House to give up on the idea of a politically risky gasoline tax 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional strategists say that without an agreement on higher gasoline 
taxes, there seems little chance for any other major tax increases that could 
make significant inroads into the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
What is worse, higher oil prices have created a sense of economic crisis in 
Washington, with fears of stagflation -- inflation and recession at the same 
time -- making it more difficult for policy-makers to take any decisive action 
on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that Congress and the Bush Administration -- and before it, the 
Ronald Reagan Administration -- had plenty of chances to deal with the budget 
deficit when the economy was more robust. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fiscal house has not been in order for six or seven years," said one top 
Federal Reserve Board economist. 
</P>
<P>
But now, strategists from both parties say, budget negotiators from Congress -- 
who are scheduled to meet with White House negotiators next week -- are 
unlikely to attempt any serious budget cuts and are instead likely to aim at 
much smaller reductions than they proposed earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Middle East crisis hit, both the White House and Congress had reached 
a tentative agreement on reducing the $169-billion budget deficit by a modest 
$50 billion. Many believe the deficit won't be cut by more than $30 billion for 
fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials say they are currently working on a new budget proposal 
of their own, but it is not clear yet whether the Administration has also 
scaled back its attempts to deal with the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, top Federal Reserve Board officials have become increasingly 
concerned by the inability of the Administration and Congress to come up with 
tax and budget policies that deal with the government's massive deficit -- and 
they remain committed curbing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials say they have no plans to give in to mounting pressure from the 
Bush Administration that they loosen their grip on interest rates and monetary 
policy to make it easier for the White House to finance growing military 
involvement in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Administration pressures the Fed to finance a military policy (without 
any companion effort to reduce the budget deficit), I think the Fed's answer 
would be a loud no," said one top Fed official. 
</P>
<P>
Other Fed officials stressed that the central bank must prove to the financial 
markets that it can maintain its independence from the White House, and so will 
try to maintain its restrictive policies even as the Administration and 
Congress go on a spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
"The job of the central bank is always the same, to provide price stability," 
said another Fed official. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, in the event of a military conflict with Iraq, Washington almost 
certainly would find a way to finance a war effort. But without sharp 
reductions in the budget deficit, runaway military costs and higher oil prices 
could force the Fed to curb inflation by clamping down on the economy, 
resulting in higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"If you aren't getting reasonable restraint on the budget, and then you add a 
major crisis on top of that, clearly you are adding inflationary pressures and 
you will end up with higher interest rates," said Stephen Axilrod, vice 
chairman of Nikko Securities International and a former Fed staffer. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, however, do not believe that President Bush deserves 
the blame, and they point the finger at Congress for its failure to act on the 
budget.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said all women and children may leave Iraq 
today, but the State Department said Iraqi authorities continue to round up 
Americans, taking nine more into custody. Hussein met with hostages and told 
them he is willing to talk to President Bush and British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department dismissed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union criticized the United States for ordering the 
expulsion of a majority of Iraqi diplomats in Washington, warning that the 
action could lead to a "spiral of escalation" in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of Operation Desert Shield was nearly doubled -- to $2.5 
billion -- by the Defense Department. U.S. Navy warships reportedly stopped two 
cargo ships, with crewmen boarding one in the Gulf of Aqaba before allowing it 
to proceed to Jordan. In Egypt, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) expressed concern about the military burden being carried by the 
United States, and after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called 
for "more help from Egypt and from other countries on the ground in Saudi 
Arabia." The United States, meanwhile, reportedly is planning to sell nearly $3 
billion in new weapons to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Stocks eked out slim gains Tuesday. Overall in the last three sessions of 
trading, the Dow Jones industrial average has leaped 131 points. Meanwhile, 
most OPEC ministers tentatively backed a deal permitting increased oil 
production to make up for losses arising from the gulf crisis.

SAUDIS READY FOR GAS ATTACK, SAY DEATHS WOULD BE FEW

<P>
Civil defense officials have ordered more than 2 million gas masks and are 
preparing to distribute them at fire stations and shopping centers to protect 
against a chemical weapons attack that could come with as little as five 
minutes' warning, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government has also set up evacuation centers for every major city in Saudi 
Arabia's Eastern province and fitted sirens on a fleet of vehicles to warn 
residents in the event of an attack. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense authorities said they are confident they would be able to limit 
casualties if Iraq were to attack Saudi population centers with chemical 
weapons, though to what extent depends on the warning time and the steps people 
take to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if all the people stayed inside the house, I think no more of a 
problem than 10 or 15 dead, (of the) people who stay outside," said Col. 
Mohammed Magrabi, head of Saudi Arabia's 3,000-strong civil defense forces. 
</P>
<P>
"But in our religion, if my God wants a man to die, yes, he will die, if he is 
inside the door or outside the door." 
</P>
<P>
In a tour of civil defense facilities for foreign reporters, Saudi officials 
displayed fleets of ambulances, fire trucks, vans, bulldozers and cargo 
vehicles, along with warehouses packed with firefighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Training classes are under way for a new volunteer civil defense force of 1,000 
recruits, which will be supplemented by an additional 1,000 in the coming 
weeks, Magrabi said. 
</P>
<P>
The siren-equipped vehicles are to roam the streets in case of an imminent 
attack, warning people to go indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"We will tell them if he's outside, cover your head and just try to run away 
against the wind," said Capt. Jamil Arbaein. "Get inside. Close the door, shut 
off the air conditioner, close the windows. If there's a mask, put it on. But 
you have to get inside as soon as possible. It shouldn't be more than one 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense headquarters is connected by telephone hot line to air force 
radar stations, allowing sirens to be sounded all over the province if an 
incoming missile or aircraft is sighted. Magrabi estimates that the authorities 
would have five minutes' warning time of an incoming missile, and more time 
with aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Magrabi said residents of Eastern province, which is nearest the Kuwaiti 
border, where tens of thousands of Iraqi troops are massed, have seemed to be 
reassured since the civil defense authorities distributed brochures telling 
them what to do in the event of a chemical attack and published statements 
minimizing the likelihood of an attack on Saudi cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger of the eastern region being hit with a chemical event is very low," 
Magrabi said, "because we have enough weapons to destroy all (Iraq's) weapons 
in this area. Maybe we will get one or two (direct hits). But this is not 
enough to make it a dangerous area."

FLIGHT: WEARY AMERICANS SAY THEY LEFT FATHERS, HUSBANDS AND HEARTS IN IRAQ AND

<P>
With tears, teddy bears and thanks, a weary assemblage of U.S. diplomatic 
spouses and children returned Tuesday evening to America, ending a three-day 
journey out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The "stressed out" group of 20 women and 27 children arrived here about 6:18 
p.m. EDT, nearly two days after crossing the burning sands of Iraq into Turkey. 
Most left behind husbands and fathers who are among 55 U.S. Embassy personnel 
from Kuwait being held against their will in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts are left in Kuwait and Baghdad with all our husbands, members of 
our families, our private American citizens and members of the international 
community left behind," said an emotional Luz Marina Colwell, the wife of U.S. 
Consul William Colwell. 
</P>
<P>
Colwell, a short, bespectacled woman in a green-and-purple dress, read from a 
statement scribbled on a scrap of paper. Her message of thanks to President 
Bush and others responsible for their safe passage was nearly drowned by the 
roar of two idling buses. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice seemed to crack and her eyes clouded with tears midway through her 
remarks as she spoke of the group's shared ordeal. At one point, she was 
steadied by the supportive arm of Marge Howell, the wife of U.S. Ambassador W. 
Nathaniel Howell, who remains in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
"During the present crisis, we learned to know each other, to care for each 
other, and we became a big family," Colwell said. "We had to keep being strong 
and keep our hearts very high." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her comments, the Americans began moving away from their 
chartered airplane. Many of the children, yawning and sleepy, carried large 
stuffed animals down the jet runway. Some too tired for the short walk were 
carried away from the plane. Largely ignoring the contingent of news 
photographers and reporters gathered to record their arrival, the adults 
hurried onto buses that took them to an undisclosed Washington-area hotel. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, however, made her feelings apparent for the cameras by wearing an 
American flag sewn onto the left thigh of her blue jeans. And, as the buses 
pulled away and the plane's crew gathered in the doorway to wave goodby, many 
of the family members returned the salutes. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said Tuesday night that the family members would 
receive some financial assistance from the government, as is customary when 
embassy personnel are displaced from their stations. After resting for the 
night, the group is expected to disperse to their homes "all across the 
country," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that there are no announced plans for President Bush, who is in 
Washington for a short spurt of work during his August vacation, to meet with 
the family members. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the group was "pretty tired out and stressed out" by their 
travels, which included a 20-hour car ride across the Iraqi desert to 
Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey. From there, they were flown to Incirlik, an 
air base in Turkey, and on to Paris before arriving at the military air base in 
suburban Washington.

Sweden said Tuesday it will send $8.75 million in humanitarian aid to the

"The refugee situation is acute, especially in Jordan. That's why we have 
decided to help," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lars-Olof Lundberg said.

Romania's Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision to free the youngest 
son of ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu because he is suffering from advanced 
cirrhosis of the liver. A military court in the Transylvanian town of Sibiu had 
decided last week to set Nicu Ceausescu free pending a verdict. He pleaded not 
guilty to "complicity to genocide" but admitted illegal possession of firearms 
and ammunition.

COUNTDOWN FOR SHUTTLE BLASTOFF GETS GREEN LIGHT

NASA managers Tuesday cleared the repaired space shuttle Columbia for the 
overnight start of its countdown for a Saturday blastoff, setting the stage for 
the first shuttle flight in four months. 
</P>
<P>
The countdown was scheduled to begin early today for a pre-dawn liftoff on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's seven-member crew was scheduled to fly to Florida from Houston 
tonight for final preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Space agency managers discussed the possibility of delaying the flight at least 
a day in order to first move the shuttle Discovery to a nearby launching pad 
for work to ready it for an Oct. 5 flight to carry the Ulysses solar probe into 
space. 
</P>
<P>
But, late Tuesday, engineers reported that Discovery would not be ready for the 
move until Saturday night at the earliest, and officials decided to press ahead 
with plans to launch Columbia on time. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia originally was scheduled to be launched on May 30, but the flight was 
delayed because of a hydrogen fuel leak in the ship's 17-inch-wide "disconnect" 
fitting, which allows the external tank to be jettisoned in space.

Facing a tobacco shortage that has produced protests and rioting in some 
cities, Moscow's City Council decided to ration cigarettes starting Sept. 1. 
When Moscow residents pick up their monthly ration coupons for sugar, they will 
also get coupons for 15 packs of cigarettes per person, the newspaper 
Vechernaya Moskva said. Tobacco coupons apparently will be issued to everyone 
-- including children and nonsmokers.

Legislation to require video display terminals in the workplace to meet 
specified design and ergonomic standards has been passed by the Assembly 
without a vote to spare. 
</P>
<P>
A 41-31 vote, the bare majority needed, was cast on the bill (AB 955), 
sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). It had passed the Senate 
by 25 to 6. Next stop for the measure is Gov. George Deukmejian's desk, but 
opponents temporarily blocked that by serving notice that they will seek 
reconsideration of the Assembly vote. 
</P>

Hayden argues that stress and other health problems associated with the use of 
VDTs are the fastest-growing category of employee disability claims in recent 
years.

ANGELS: RANGER PITCHER GETS A WARM RECEPTION FROM THE CROWD, BUT MCCASKILL

<P>
If striking out the Angels in the eighth inning Tuesday night was his farewell 
to the Anaheim Stadium fans who thrilled to his exploits during eight of his 
best seasons, Nolan Ryan said goodby with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
He would rather have said goodby with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old right-hander made the 700th start of his career, a level 
reached by only five pitchers before him. He also increased his career 
strikeout total to 5,257 when he struck out Dick Schofield, Luis Polonia and 
Devon White in the eighth, which evoked a standing ovation from the 37,692 fans 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"They've always treated me special here, and I've always felt like I have a 
special relationship with them," said Ryan, who struck out 11. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk McCaskill wouldn't allow Ryan to add another victory to his collection 
of 301. Ensnaring the Rangers in a web of superb control, McCaskill pitched a 
four-hitter in the Angels' 2-0 victory over Ryan and the Texas Rangers. It was 
McCaskill's first shutout since Aug. 20, 1989, and his first complete game 
since last September. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, it's a thrill to beat Nolan Ryan," said McCaskill, who made only 
94 pitches and improved to 10-9. "It's something I'll be able to tell my 
(3-month-old) son. I could tell him now, but he might not understand." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (12-7) understood that he had been beaten by an outstanding effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He really pitched well," Ryan said of McCaskill, who was 4 in 1965 when Ryan 
broke into professional baseball. "He kept us off stride and made good pitches. 
He never was in trouble but that one inning (the sixth)." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth was the only inning in which Texas got a runner past first base. Geno 
Petralli lined a shot off the mound for an infield hit and went to third on 
former Angel Gary Pettis' broken-bat single to right. But Angel catcher Lance 
Parrish caught Pettis attempting to steal second and Jeff Huson flied out to 
center, defusing the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk was pretty sharp. I've probably seen him throw the ball a little harder 
and have better stuff, but he had great control," Parrish said. "He made a lot 
of good pitches." 
</P>
<P>
So did Ryan, who has struck out 46 in his last six games but is only 1-3 with 
one no-decision since earning his 300th victory July 31. 
</P>
<P>
"He struck me out three times," Parrish said after Ryan's fifth double-figure 
strikeout game of the season and 204th of his career. "I don't know what it is, 
but I can't seem to hit him." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored their two runs on one hit, in the third. Johnny Ray dumped a 
single to short right-center field for the first hit of the game and moved into 
scoring position when Schofield walked on a 3-and-2 pitch. Both advanced when 
Ryan's one-strike curveball to Polonia broke inside and in the dirt, and Ray 
scored on Polonia's meek tapper toward first that was played by Ryan, who never 
hesitated in going to first for the sure out. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first run he had given up at Anaheim Stadium since his final 1979 
appearance, having pitched two 3-0 shutouts here last season and two scoreless 
innings in the 1989 All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw out of the side of my eye where (Ray) was and the angle," Ryan said. "In 
that situation I have to assume they're going to score a run and get the out. 
You can't open the inning up and give them an opportunity for a big inning. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew later it was going to be the game-winning run I might have gone 
(home with the throw). I probably had a 50-50 shot. With our type of ballclub 
you have to feel the chances of them shutting us out aren't real good." 
</P>
<P>
Schofield scored the second run on a grounder to third by White that was thrown 
away by third baseman Jeff Kunkel, a run than McCaskill wouldn't need. He did 
need -- and want -- to pitch a complete game to boost his morale, which has 
been shaken by the bone spurs in his right elbow that have limited his starts 
and made him feel like an incomplete pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to throw one this year and this is about the only way I could do it," 
he said, referring to the low-pitch count. "I wanted to prove it to myself and 
the bullpen, because those guys know they have to be ready every time I pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the efficiency of his performance, which lowered his earned-run average 
to 2.96, McCaskill wasn't completely satisfied. "I don't think it's up there 
(in his personal rankings). Important victories happen when you're in a race," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan may be in a race against time, having said he is not sure if he'll he will 
return next season. "It's nice the fans appreciated my effort tonight," he 
said. "Around the league, fans have been real receptive to me and treated me 
almost as though I was a hometown player. This has been a real special year in 
that sense."

Chuck Finley will pitch for a major league all-star team that will play an 
eight-game series against a team of Japanese all-stars in Japan beginning Nov. 
2. . . . Bert Blyleven might throw off the mound today for the first time since 
going on the disabled list Aug. 19 because of a strained right shoulder. He 
long-tossed Tuesday without discomfort. "It's getting better," said the 
39-year-old right-hander, who has been at 279 career victories since July 20. 
His status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill, placed on the disabled list retroactive to Saturday because of a 
sprained left wrist, threw batting practice Tuesday -- at his request. "I've 
got a lot of days with nothing to do," said Hill, who pitched one inning July 8 
during the Angels' 20-7 loss at Milwaukee. "I might as well find something to 
do. It's not going to hurt my (injured) hand." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing got a cortisone injection to alleviate muscle spasms in his 
right-lower back, which is not the area that has troubled him the past two 
seasons. He wasn't available Tuesday. . . . Kent Anderson (pulled hamstring) is 
jogging and hitting. He is eligible to come off the disabled list Sept. 9. . . 
. All military personnel and their dependents will be admitted free to Angel 
home games.

MIKE PENNER: RYAN GETS BLAST OF HIS ANGEL PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Turning back the clock can be hazardous duty. Nolan Ryan knows. When you're 43 
going on 25, you sometimes run the risk of going back to 1972 as well. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Ryan used to do it during his early Angel days, back when the Big A 
still had a Big A and the Angel offense was lower case all the way. 
</P>
<P>
A standing ovation as he walked in from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven strikeouts, including the entire side during the last inning he worked. 
</P>
<P>
A three-hitter, consisting of a flare to center field and two ground balls that 
didn't leave the infield. 
</P>
<P>
A throwing error by his third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
A walk followed by a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-0 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome home, Nollie. Welcome back to where you once belonged. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from atop the exercise cycle in the Texas Ranger clubhouse, where he 
attempted to churn away some heavy frustration, Ryan had to admit that Tuesday 
night had the same taste, the same touch and the same smell as some of those 
senseless Angel evenings of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, in a way," he said with a grin. "A walk and a wild pitch. I put those 
guys in scoring position and it cost us a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in that position before." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was too decent to add that he also has been victimized by shoddy defense 
and sullen offense before. Too many times. Tuesday's loss to Kirk McCaskill 
marked the 49th time Ryan had been beaten by a shutout. That ties him with Phil 
Niekro for second place on the all-time list, trailing only Walter (Big Train, 
Bad Karma) Johnson and his 65 shutout defeats. 
</P>
<P>
But Ryan, as always, refused to lift a pointing finger. "They don't get any 
easier," is all he would say, "because tonight, I don't got anybody to blame 
but myself." 
</P>
<P>
Let us recount the sins of Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the top of the third inning, Ryan gets Johnny Ray to pop up to 
shallow center field. Gary Pettis, the Texas center fielder, is as fast as 
anyone who plays his position, but he wasn't fast enough to grab this one. 
Pettis' head-first dive comes up empty and the Angels had their first hit of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield bats next and cues a fly ball down the right field line, into 
foul territory. Ranger right fielder Ruben Sierra draws a bead on the ball but 
just as he reaches the railing, an overzealous souvenir-seeker lunges for the 
ball and tumbles onto the field. Neither Sierra nor the fan make the play, so 
Schofield gets to bat again. 
</P>
<P>
He works Ryan for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching to Luis Polonia, Ryan uncorks a curveball in the dirt. Texas catcher 
Geno Petralli can't get a grip and the ball bounds away. Wild pitch. Angels on 
second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia sends a swinging bunt down the first-base line, which Ryan gloves and 
throws to first for the out, allowing Ray to score. Devon White follows with a 
routine grounder to third, which first winds up in the glove of Ranger third 
baseman Jeff Kunkel and then bounces in the dirt past first baseman Rafael 
Palmeiro for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield scores and the Angels build a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Atrocious inning by Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
From behind the desk in the visiting manager's office, Bobby Valentine polished 
off one beer and asked for two more. He kicked up his feet and ran a hand 
through his hair. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a good job tonight," Valentine said, referring to Ryan. "I told him he 
did a good job. That's the easy part. Explaining why he didn't get a win is the 
tough part." 
</P>
<P>
He had a point. 
</P>
<P>
"A bloop, a walk, a ball gets by the catcher, a ground ball and a ground ball 
-- and they score two runs," Valentine recounted while he grimaced. "Whew." 
</P>
<P>
Little did Ryan know that when he fielded Polonia's bouncer and threw to first 
instead of home that the run would eventually be enough to beat him. Or so he 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, I had to assume that we are gonna score a run," Ryan said. 
"I had to get the out at first and not give them the opportunity at a 
good-sized inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I might've had a 50-50 chance at (Ray), but with our type of ballclub, you had 
to feel the chances of them shutting us out weren't real good." 
</P>
<P>
But then the heart of the Ranger offense -- Palmeiro, Sierra and Julio Franco 
-- goes hitless and Pettis is thrown out trying to steal second with a runner 
on third in the sixth inning and McCaskill pitches his first shutout in more 
than a year, dating to Aug. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that in games like this," Ryan said, "that you've got to give 
credit to the guy across the hall." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan threw 119 pitches but was throwing just as hard at the end of the game as 
in the beginning. Ask Schofield, Polonia and White, who struck out in the 
eighth inning. Or ask Dante Bichette, who painfully took a Ryan fastball off 
the right elbow in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like I got him pretty good," Ryan said, "so I had to ask him how he 
was. But Doug (Rader, Angel Manager) said it didn't stay on his elbow long 
enough to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
With Ryan, who has done this for so many years, there is no great honor in 
finishing strong when you're down by two runs. There is no great thrill in 
striking out the side in the bottom of the eighth when you know there won't be 
a bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice way to finish up a loss, I guess," he said, managing a smile. And 
then he kept pedaling, hopefully back to the future.

THE WINDS OF CHANGE COULD RUFFLE TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of planning, millions of dollars and nearly as many prayer candles 
lit by football Coach Gene Murphy, Cal State Fullerton's on-campus stadium is 
finally scheduled to open in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But will the Titans live to enjoy the comforts of a home stadium for long? Or 
will the City of Fullerton wind up with the finest soccer facility in Orange 
County? 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to think that multi-purpose stadium won't be used for football," 
Murphy said of the Titan Sports Complex, scheduled for construction beginning 
this fall. "But that's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has survived for years in Division I-A despite its substandard 
existence. The Titans have had no on-campus stadium, meager facilities, a tiny 
budget and minimal fan support -- they ranked 105th out of 106 Division I-A 
teams in home attendance last season. 
</P>
<P>
But vast changes are said to be sweeping college football, and it's doubtful 
Fullerton will get swept up in them. The Titans will likely be swept aside, or, 
possibly, swept under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
The forming of what athletic directors are calling "super conferences" -- the 
aligning of major football-playing schools for television revenue purposes -- 
could threaten the Big West Conference's Division I-A status. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial Big West power Fresno State, the only conference school that annually 
fulfills the NCAA's Division I-A attendance requirements, would be attractive 
to a super conference. Other possibilities might include San Jose State, with 
its strong program and large television market, and Nevada Las Vegas because of 
its strong basketball program. If the Bulldogs, Spartans or Rebels leave, as 
some have speculated, the Big West could find itself scrambling for its 
Division I-A life. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Division I-A future could depend on its ability to align itself 
with other Division I-A teams that don't become part of the super conference 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
And much of its football future could depend on the financial and spectator 
impact of the sports complex and the mood of the school's faculty, which has 
questioned the viability of the football program. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has a crystal ball and there's uncertainty as to what's going to happen 
nationally," Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said. "I'm optimistic that 
these changes will work to our benefit, but that remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame has cut a TV deal with NBC, Penn State is joining the Big Ten 
Conference, Arkansas is leaving the Southwest Conference for the Southeast 
Conference, and many believe Fresno State and, possibly San Jose State and 
UNLV, will look for greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
Many athletic directors doubt that the College Football Assn., a consortium of 
64 major football-playing schools whose primary purpose is to negotiate 
television contracts, will exist beyond its present contract, which expires in 
1995. Instead, super conferences will strike their own TV deals. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who isn't in the upper echelon of our conference from the standpoint of 
TV attractability and home attendance is a little nervous about what's 
happening across the country," Big West Commissioner Jim Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
The upper echelon of Big West football, though, consists of only one team -- 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
In order to remain a Division I-A conference, the NCAA states that 60% of the 
conference's schools (five in the Big West) must either: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have a 30,000-seat stadium and average 17,000 fans at home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Average 20,000 fans for all games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Meet these criteria once every four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
If you take Fresno State, which ranked 56th among Division I-A schools in home 
attendance with a 34,100 average in 1989, out of the Big West the conference 
might have trouble meeting the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem for schools like Fullerton and Long Beach is they're not meeting 
Division I-A criteria on their own, so they're dependent on the conference," 
Haney said. "Other than Fresno, everyone in our conference is experiencing hard 
times." 
</P>
<P>
In the NCAA home-attendance rankings, Big West conference schools hold down the 
last four of 106 spots: Cal State Long Beach (2,650), Fullerton (3,741), 
University of the Pacific (5,540) and San Jose State (8,118). 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State ranked 100th with an average of 11,304, Utah State was 94th at 
15,553 and Nevada Las Vegas was 92nd at 17,100. 
</P>
<P>
For the Titans to continue in Division I-A, it's imperative they remain in a 
I-A conference. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who says some Big West teams might eventually align with teams in the 
Western Athletic Conference, is not that concerned with super conferences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think schools will want to continue to play schools that don't have 
super-conference teams," Carroll said. "We don't want to over-schedule, but 
there's nothing wrong with us playing a Top 20 team every year. I think there's 
a place for us." 
</P>
<P>
Some have questioned whether Fullerton's place is in Division I-A football. The 
Titans certainly aren't a model I-A program. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Fullerton should discontinue the sport because of bottom-of-the-barrel 
home attendance figures and the high cost of the program compared to its 
minimal revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Football has cost us millions of dollars that could have been used in academic 
programs," said Dr. Robert Feldman, a Fullerton professor and member of the 
Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Some also criticize a scheduling philosophy that has Fullerton playing road 
games that it has virtually no chance of winning in exchange for large 
guarantee checks that help sustain the program. 
</P>
<P>
They lament that Fullerton has dropped four athletic teams (men's and women's 
golf, men's water polo and men's tennis) in the past 10 years while football 
trudges on. This past spring, fencing and men's gymnastics were on the chopping 
block but received a last-minute stay. 
</P>
<P>
The critics also are disgusted by recent off-the-field troubles -- one Titan 
football player was shot and two others arrested during a bar-room brawl this 
past spring, and an El Toro Marine died from injuries incurred in a fight with 
two Titan football players in April, 1988. Charges were not filed against the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a large football faction, those who point to Murphy's 54-60-1 
record in 10 seasons and marvel at how much he has accomplished with so little. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans allocate the equivalent of 60 scholarships per year -- 35 fewer than 
the NCAA's Division I-A limit. Despite their lack of an on-campus stadium and 
fan support, they have placed first or second in the Big West in six of the 
past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Several Fullerton players have gone on to the NFL and several Titan assistants 
have moved up to the professional ranks or to bigger Division I programs. 
</P>
<P>
And many think the Titan Sports Complex, which will include a 10,000-seat, 
multi-purpose stadium, will lead to football prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
As it has so often, the football debate raged on in the Fullerton Academic 
Senate this past spring, with some professors wanting to give the sport the 
boot. As it has every time, football won and will be around at least another 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But can Titan football continue to exist as it has in Division I-A, and will it 
ever develop a substantial following? 
</P>
<P>
Or will it just fade away? 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, Fullerton's athletic director and CEO (Chief Executive Optimist), 
doesn't have any grand illusions of Fullerton becoming a national power in 
football or competing with USC and UCLA for Southern California's college 
sports-entertainment dollar. He doesn't even see football turning a profit in 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
But he does believe that there's a niche for Fullerton in Division I-A and in 
Orange County. And the key to developing that niche is the on-campus stadium, 
which Carroll says will allow the school to change its scheduling philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who have averaged about four home games and eight road games per 
season the past 12 years, will play more at home. And they won't be tempted to 
change home games to away games to increase profits, as they did with the 
Fresno State and San Jose State games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll also hopes to schedule one or two attractive nonconference opponents at 
home each season. The Titans already have lined up Mississippi State for their 
1992 season opener, and Army, Temple and Texas Tech have agreed to play at 
Fullerton in future years. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll also sees the stadium having a positive impact on attendance. A 
seat-option plan, under which prime-location season tickets are tied into 
donations to the program, should increase fund-raising. The stadium, which will 
have the capacity to expand to 30,000, also should help recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll hopes increased revenue from ticket sales and fund-raisers will 
eliminate the need for road games against schools such as Louisiana State, 
Auburn and Florida and allow the Titans to play a more realistic schedule. 
</P>
<P>
If the Titans can field competitive teams and play quality nonconference 
opponents and conference rivals at home, Carroll sees no reason they shouldn't 
attract good-sized crowds. 
</P>
<P>
And if they continue to challenge for the conference championship and win an 
occasional title, Carroll believes the program has the potential to gain an 
occasional Top-20 ranking, as it did in 1984, or at least be considered among 
the nation's top 50 teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Some say we shouldn't play football because we don't make money on the sport, 
that not enough people come to games, that no one cares -- all different 
things," Carroll said. "I think all those can be overcome in the next five 
years, and I'm looking forward to that happening and being able to tell the 
detractors they were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll envisions a Titan Sports Complex awash in blue and orange; others look 
at the football program and see red. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team lives a bare-bones existence because it participates in an area we 
can't afford to be participating in," Feldman said. "What we wind up doing 
every year is having this debate. Which program will we have to throw overboard 
this year? This issue won't die." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman likens the football program to a "great big sponge" that absorbs all of 
the resources of the athletic department. Carroll says the description isn't 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Football generates about one-third of the athletic department's revenue and 
spends about that much," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
However, more than half of the revenue listed as "generated" in the football 
budget is actually state funds that are allocated to the athletic department. 
In 1988-89, for example, football received $647,018 in state funds and 
generated $557,538 for a total of $1,204,556, which nearly covered expenses of 
$1,211,318. 
</P>
<P>
With state money and a pinch-the-pennies program, the school has balanced its 
football budget most years. Without state money, there wouldn't be a football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators are tired of seeing so much state money -- about $5 million in 
the past 10 years -- going to football. But Fullerton isn't about to scrap the 
sport with the long-awaited sports complex, which has been in the works for 
more than 10 years, on the verge of construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made it all this time without a home stadium," Carroll said. "Think of 
what we can do if we have a decent facility at home." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll is adamant about the Titans remaining in Division I-A. He says it isn't 
feasible for Fullerton to play as an independent, and it doesn't make financial 
sense to drop to Division I-AA, II or III. 
</P>
<P>
In an Athletics Council report this past spring, Carroll concluded that 
dropping to Division II status would result in a net budget savings of only 
$1,606, and dropping to Division III would save $367,628. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Carroll is concerned, it's Division I-A or bust. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a possibility," Murphy said of the latter option. "Like a lot of other 
things, we'll just deal with it when it comes. If you can't control it, there's 
not much you can do about it."

ESPERANZA POISED TO END LOS ALAMITOS' FIVE-YEAR REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simple numbers tell the story of Los Alamitos High School's reign in the Empire 
League over the past five seasons. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* The Griffins have won 20 consecutive league games; their last loss came in 
the opening game of the 1986 season, 25-8 to Loara. 
</P>
<P>
* Four league titles in the past five years, including three straight with 
quarterback Todd Gragnano in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
* An overall record of 52-9 and two appearances in the Southern Section 
Division III championship game. 
</P>
<P>
* Five consecutive victories over Esperanza, consistently one of the top teams 
in the county. "I can't think of anyone we've ever lost to more than three 
straight times," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Los Alamitos continue its domination into the '90s following the 
graduation of Gragnano (University of Nebraska), tailback Erik Mitchell 
(Colorado), linebacker Brian Havens (Nebraska) and lineman Hartwell Brown 
(Stanford)? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be good, but you have to favor Esperanza," Los Alamitos Coach John 
Barnes said. "They have every one of their skilled players returning and all 
those buffaloes (linemen) to go with them. They have the best team in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Meek picked Los Alamitos to win the six-team league based on its 
past success and his team's inability to beat the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, we want to win the league, and in order to get the championship, 
we're going to have to beat Los Alamitos," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year drought could end in the league opener -- Thursday, Oct. 11 -- 
when Esperanza plays host to Los Alamitos. The winner should go on to win the 
title in a league of haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza has compiled a 17-13-1 record over the past three years after going 
9-2-1 in Meek's first season. Meek has utilized an I-formation, Pro Set and, 
finally, the Delaware Wing-T in an effort to find the right offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel most comfortable with the Wing-T," Meek said. "We're able to throw 
better out of this formation and run some misdirection. We've always been a 
good trap blocking team, so the offense really suits us well." 
</P>
<P>
Keith McDonald, starting his third year at quarterback, will be passing to two 
returning all-league receivers, tight end Reid Pullen and wide receiver Jarod 
Smith. Pullen caught three touchdown passes last year against Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to score some points and we have excellent team speed on the 
defensive side," Meek said. "I'm expecting big things from Keith and Pullen is 
one of the best receivers we've ever had here." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parlin, who rushed for 517 yards as a junior, also returns and Meek is 
excited about the prospects of 200-pound fullback Gerrick Emry joining Parlin 
in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect Gerrick to carry a lot of the offensive load," Meek said. "Parlin 
will be used primarily as a linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
The imposing task of replacing Gragnano and his 6,140 career passing yards at 
Los Alamitos goes to John Collins, who started every game at flanker last year. 
"He's going to be very good," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
This should be the year that running back LaQuan Beckton finally fulfills the 
lofty expectations that many had when he first appeared on the varsity as a 
sophomore. Beckton played in the shadow of Mitchell's speed last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on a mission," Barnes said. "He's grown to 200 pounds, bench-presses 375 
pounds and vertical jumps 36 inches. He's worked very hard to improve his speed 
and is hoping to have a big year." 
</P>
<P>
The best athlete on the team is Tyler Cashman, who can play split end, tight 
end or free safety and also doubles as the team's punter. A player to watch for 
the future is sophomore free safety George Segan, whom Barnes said "has as much 
athletic ability as anyone I've coached here." 
</P>
<P>
Loara, coming off an 8-2-1 season, will begin a new era under Coach John 
deFries after the retirement of Herb Hill and the graduation of running back 
Coy Collins, who broke six offensive school records during his three-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is wondering about the transition from Herb Hill and what changes 
John is going to make at Loara," Barnes said. "They had an awfully good 
sophomore team (9-1) last year, so you know they have a lot of young talent 
coming up." 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS -- The Centurions were the surprise team of the league last year, 
battling for a playoff spot until the final week of the season and shutting out 
Los Alamitos for three quarters before losing, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the season with 22 players and finished with 25," said Coach John 
Selbe. "We didn't quite get it done because we had so many injuries 
offensively. It was encouraging to have 40 players come out this year." 
</P>
<P>
Selbe calls speedy slotback Sean Dangaran "our secret weapon." Dangaran had the 
team's longest run from scrimmage, a 60-yard touchdown, last season. Youssef 
Semaan figures to rarely come off the field, playing flanker and defensive back 
and also punting. 
</P>
<P>
Three standouts on Cypress' defensive line last year -- Jayson Bern, Ramon Reid 
and Joe Toohey -- are now assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
EL DORADO -- The county's worst team last year should be the county's most 
improved team this year. El Dorado had only two players with varsity experience 
entering the 1989 season, but 22 lettermen assure the Golden Hawks of a more 
experienced team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge all season long, but the kids never gave up," said Coach 
Rick Jones. "We had a good off-season in the weight room and some success in 
summer passing leagues." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado's season opener should be memorable against Century, a two-year-old 
public school in Santa Ana playing its first season of varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got one team that didn't win a game last year and another going for its 
first win in school history," Jones said. "I see two teams who are going to be 
very hungry." 
</P>
<P>
ESPERANZA -- Here's a switch. There's only one starting lineman weighing more 
than 225 pounds but two sophomores, Travis Kirschke and Brian Werner, should 
continue Esperanza's tradition of having the biggest linemen in the county 
before they graduate. Kirschke is 6-foot-2, 220 pounds and Werner is 6-foot-4, 
240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anyone 6-5 and 250 pounds on the line like we've had in the 
past," Meek said. "But I like our team speed on the defensive side and our 
offensive guards run well." 
</P>
<P>
Meek, on linebacker Mike Burns: "He ran a 4.6 in the 40 as a 190-pound 
sophomore and he still runs a 4.6 as a 237-pound senior. He could turn out to 
be the best big player we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
KATELLA -- Score two-year starting quarterback Dennis Briggs' decision to quit 
football last spring, "E-5" after the all-Southern Section third baseman told 
Coach Larry Anderson he wanted to concentrate on baseball last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs subsequently changed his mind but lost his starting position to Chris 
Reed. Anderson, an assistant baseball coach, said he had a "falling out" with 
Briggs but later welcomed the veteran back to the team. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson needs all the experienced help he can get with only four starters 
returning. Katella had its worst defensive unit in Anderson's three seasons, 
but added, "Athletically, we're a little better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Don Popovich, an assistant baseball coach at Rancho Santiago College, will 
teach special education at Katella and assist the Knights' freshman football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
LOARA -- DeFries, a 12-year assistant under Hill from 1971-83, admits he hasn't 
coached a defensive team in seven years as he gets acquainted with his 
linebackers and secondary through two-a-day drills. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Charlie Gipson will move from wide receiver to quarterback and 
David Kang, the chief blocker for Collins last year, will be the primary 
ballcarrier. DeFries' major change will be to allow Gipson to develop into more 
of a dropback passer and become a little more active in the Saxons' offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do things pretty much the same way Herb did," deFries said. And 
where's Hill been during two-a-day drills? "He's fishing in Montana," deFries 
said. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ALAMITOS -- Barnes and his staff have established Los Alamitos as one of 
the top programs in Southern California, compiling a 78-38-5 record in 11 
years. "Year in and year out, the staff at Los Alamitos does the best job in 
the league," said John Selbe, Cypress coach. 
</P>
<P>
Depth could be a problem with only 45 players on the roster but 54 players 
reported for the sophomore team and six will play on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line will be anchored by tackle Kevin Kropf and guard Justin 
Stewart, who played every down last year, and returning all-league linebacker 
Ed Leiva is the strongest player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine Los Alamitos with better skilled-position players than 
they had last year," Anderson said. "But they're very good again this year." 
</P>

Jr.; Ralph Williams, TE/LB, 5-11, 165, Jr. and John Bradaric, LB, 6-0, 160, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: It has been 10 years since Cypress advanced to the playoffs. Cypress 
allowed an average of 12.6 points per game in 1989, but eight defensive 
starters graduated. Dawson, a two-year all-league star, was hampered all year 
by an ankle injury suffered in the season opener but is fully recovered. Semaan 
was the league's top punter last year, averaging nearly 40 yards per kick. 
Garcia won the starting quarterback job in the spring, edging out senior Joe 
Groover. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rick Jones (second year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 0-10, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 22 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Five on offense, five on defense

Top returnees: Jason Bluth, QB, 5-10, 145, Sr.; Steve Smith, C, 6-1, 190, C; 
Armando Lopez, OT, 6-0, 247, Sr.; Mike Roth, TE, 6-0, 170, Jr.; Scott 
D'Antuono, LB, 6-1, 161, Sr.; Travis Thompson, FS, 6-2, 165, Sr.; Joe Lee, NG, 
5-9, 225, Jr.; Bill Thomas, DT, 6-4, 205, DT and Coulter Marshall, DE, 6-1,

Top newcomers: Bill McAdam, WR/DB, 6-4, 195, Sr.; Paul Algarin, FB, 5-11, 173, 
Jr.; Danny Hickey, DT, 6-3, 192, Sr. and James Capellino, RB, 5-4, 180, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Rick Jones replaced Carl Sweet only 10 weeks before the '89 season 
opener and the results were predictable; El Dorado scored three touchdowns in 
10 losses. "I was still trying to figure out personnel in midseason," Jones 
said. "Hopefully, we've learned and grown from last year. Now, we have to learn 
how to win." Bluth started five games last year and D'Antuono will be the 
defensive captain. The good news is that El Dorado's freshman team was 8-2 and 
league champion last year, so help is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary Meek (fifth year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 6-5, 3-2 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 23 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Six on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Keith McDonald, QB, 6-2, 205, Sr.; Mike Burns, LB, 6-3, 235, 
Sr.; Jarod Smith, WB, 5-10, 170, Sr.; Mark Parlin, LB/FB, 6-1, 225, Sr.; 
Gerrick Emry, FB/LB, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Reid Pullen, TE/DE, 6-2, 207, Sr.; Chad 
Richter, OT, 6-2, 240, OT, Rich Gutierrez, 6-0, 240, Sr.; Ian Stewart, C, 5-10,

Jr.; Chad Madrick, OT/DT, 6-3, 223, Jr.; Travis Kirschle, DT/OG, 6-3, 225, So.; 
Al Medyn, DT/OT, 6-2, 230, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: After three average seasons, Esperanza should return to championship 
form with some of the county's top skilled-position players and a strong 
defense. Meek anticipates McDonald passing 20 times per game and compares the 
two-year starter to El Toro's Rob Johnson. Burns is the team's most heavily 
recruited player and reminds Meek of former Mission Viejo star linebacker John 
Pease. Burns missed five games last year with torn ligaments in his ankle but 
has fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Katella 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Larry Anderson (fourth year)

1989 record: 3-6-1, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 15 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Chris Reed, QB, 6-2, 180, Sr.; Dennis Briggs, SS, 5-11, 170, 
Sr.; Art Vance, WR/FS, 5-11, 160, Sr.; Eric Hicks, CB, 5-10, 170, Sr.; T.J. 
Fletcher, FB, 5-9, 170, Sr.; Vince Farace, DE, 6-1, 250, Jr.; Bryan Castro, LB, 
5-7, 160, Jr. and Johnny Bowers, 5-10, 175, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ryan Irving, TB, 5-7, 160, Jr.; Jim Gladwin, C, 5-10, 190, So.; 
Steve Rutherford, OG, 5-10, 205, Jr.; Scott Joest, OG, 5-11, 200, Jr.; Steve 
Young, TE, 6-1, 180, Sr. and Gary Henessey, FB, 5-10, 170, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Reed will start the opening two games at quarterback after two-year 
starter Dennis Briggs quit the team last spring and then changed his mind. 
"Dennis wanted to concentrate on baseball, then decided he made an error," 
Anderson said. "I felt I owed Reed two games as the starting quarterback." Last 
year's offensive line graduated and five juniors off a 4-6 sophomore team will 
start. Katella starts two speedsters, Vance and Irving, off its track team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loara 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John deFries (first year) 
</P>

Jr.; David Kang, 5-9, 180, FB/DE; Charlie Gipson, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Brian 
Blanks, CB, 5-11, 165, Jr. and John Carrer, TE/DE, 6-2, 190, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Sean Carne, OT/DT, 5-9, 206, Sr.; Kirk Arnold, OT, 6-0, 210, 
Sr.; Dan Bokelman, WR/SS, 5-7, 145, Sr.; Jason Wright, LB, 6-1, 220, Jr. and 
Jason Ortiz, LB, 5-11, 183, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: DeFries, a seven-year assistant line coach at Rancho Santiago College, 
replaces Herb Hill, who was the county's winningest coach when he resigned. 
DeFries, on the transition to high school football: "You're a part-time parent, 
baby-sitter, academic adviser and personal counselor besides being a coach. 
It's a lot more work." Six players off a 9-1 league championship sophomore team 
will start, including Jason Wright, younger brother of former all-county 
linebacker Chris Wright. Loara has more players (62) than any team in the 
league, but nine starters will go both ways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Barnes (12th year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 9-2, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 23 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Five on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Tyler Cashman, WR, 6-4, 210, Sr.; Ed Leiva, LB, 5-11, 215, Sr.; 
LaQuan Beckton, TB, 5-9, 200, Sr.; John Collins, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Justin 
Stewart, OG, 6-2, 220, Sr.; Kevin Kropf, OT, 6-3, 205, Sr.; Matt Ragland, OG, 
6-2, 225, Sr.; Ryan Eagle, DT, 6-1, 235, Sr.; Aaron Garrido, DE, 6-2, 190, DE; 
Josh Beeney, CB, 5-9, 170, Sr. and Eric Wallace, PK, 6-0, 185, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Andrew Fuentes, WR, 5-9, 185, Sr.; Ed Dominguez, C, 5-11, 205, 
Jr.; George Segan, FS, 6-1, 185, So. and Alex Lin, LB, 6-1, 205, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Barnes is predicting that Collins, a converted flanker, will be the 
school's next successful quarterback following J.T. Snow, Tom Williamson and 
Todd Gragnano. "He scrambles well and throws very well," Barnes said. Collins, 
a honor student, led Los Alamitos to the championship of the 20-team Cerritos 
College passing tournament. Cashman is being recruited by USC, Penn State and 
Miami.

Rough Seas: It was a bad time at sea for George Bush. And we're not talking the 
Persian Gulf here. On Monday, the President's speedboat conked out off 
Kennebunkport, Me., with Canada Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his wife, 
Mila, aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Alternator burnout was the alleged culprit. The party transferred to a trailing 
Coast Guard boat. Then on Tuesday, Bush got hooked in the ear while fishing 
with son Jeb and Mulroney. "It was not a hostile act," Mulroney joked. 
Diplomatic sources said it was Jeb who landed his father. 
</P>
<P>
* Now See This: A group of women protesting what they said were unfair, 
outdated laws about public wear led a topless march Monday through downtown 
Madison, Wis. "My breasts are not disorderly," read a sign carried by one 
protester; another sign read "Breasts, not bombs." The march followed a court 
hearing in which Marcia Weisman pleaded innocent to a charge of disorderly 
conduct for refusing to wear a top at a Madison public beach. She said it was 
unfair that men could go shirtless in public but not women. There were no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
* Oh Say Can You See: Leona Helmsley, whose husband, Harry, has a controlling 
interest in the Empire State Building, said Monday the skyscraper will be lit 
in the colors of the American flag until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved. 
The lights go on today. Helmsley is appealing a federal tax conviction. 
</P>
<P>
* A Little Respect: Businessman Warren Meyer wants to enshrine junk mail in a 
museum. "There's a lot more to junk mail than Ed McMahon's handsome face," said 
Meyer, known as the "junk mail king." He said junk mail suffers from a negative 
image; he hopes his museum, due to open in mid-1991 in Los Angeles, will 
deliver some respect.

CLIMATE-CONTROL BENEFITS, IMPROVED DURABILITY, BETTER FIT AND, SOMETIMES JUST 
FOR FUN, COLOR CHANGES.

A tennis player volleying in the heat of the day probably won't know -- or even 
care -- if his Nike tennis shirt is made of Coolmax, a moisture-repelling 
fabric. But when he notices how dry he stays during the game, he might go back 
and buy another shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Coolmax, developed by Du Pont, is just one of many new "performance" fibers 
being used to manufacture state-of-the-art activewear. 
</P>
<P>
These technologically advanced fabrics take a marketing cue from today's 
specialized athletic shoe business. Sports men and women are already paying up 
to $175 for tony shoes featuring pump gadgets and patented inner sole systems. 
Fiber manufacturers are betting that consumers will embrace high-tech apparel 
just as readily. 
</P>
<P>
Some fibers, like Du Pont's Coolmax, repel moisture. Others, like Microfine, 
also by Du Pont, repel wind yet allow perspiration to escape. Microfine is used 
in bicycle wear by Hind. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their climate-control benefits, most of these new fibers offer 
improved colorfastness and a better fit. 
</P>
<P>
Just as celebrities have been endorsing apparel lines and tennis shoes, they 
are now working as spokesmen for new fibers. Tennis champ Andre Agassi, who 
wears Nike sportswear, is one. Cyclist Greg LeMond's Coolmax-clad physique is 
featured in full-page color ads in national magazines. Triathlete Dave Scott of 
Hawaii also endorses the fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"If your body doesn't have the ability to breathe, your body temperature is 
going to rise and you're not going to be able to dissipate heat," Scott says, 
adding that he believes clothes made from the fabric enhance his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Supplex is another new Du Pont fiber being used in activewear and swimwear 
fashions. Laurie Allyn, vice president of merchandising for five swimwear 
divisions of Apparel Ventures Inc. -- Too Hot Brazil, Citrus, Sassafras, Cessa 
and Cha Cha Cha -- says designers appreciate Supplex's cotton-like look and 
feel -- without cotton's inherent fading problems in salty or chlorinated 
water. She also favors Supplex over nylon. 
</P>
<P>
"These suits, made of nylon, would look too cheap and sleazy," Allyn says, "but 
Supplex, with its cotton look, makes them work. It provides the needed fit and 
color fastness." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should expect to pay more for these high-tech fabrics. A running top 
made of Coolmax would cost 50% to 75% more than one made of a typical nylon 
fabric, says Pete Szanto, communications director for Du Pont's Coolmax 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn says that Supplex costs 25% to 30% more per yard than nylon, a fabric 
used traditionally in swimwear. She estimates a bathing suit that might cost 
$47 will now run "in the mid $50 range," if made of Supplex. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Manasse Wiese, who designs swimwear for L.A.-based Catalina, is using 
Supplex for brightly colored solid and patterned halter-style suits. Wiese, who 
says she pays about $3 more per yard for Supplex than for nylon/lycra blends, 
says she's not sure if Catalina customers will be willing to pay an extra $6 or 
so more for a Supplex suit. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is very athletic, it might make a difference to them that what they 
wear is made of Coolmax or Supplex, but most of the new performance fibers are 
for pure sports." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, the Ventura-based company that outfits athletes as well as exploring 
expeditions, has the exclusive right to Capilene, a polyester fabric that 
absorbs moisture easily and dries quickly. The company uses the fabric as a 
lining for outerwear, and for long underwear. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest clothing collections using high-tech fabric carries the 
Freezy Freakies label. It came about when 10-year-old Judah Rifkin suggested a 
line of outerwear that would go with a pair of his winter gloves, which changed 
colors in various temperatures. His uncle took him up on the idea, became a 
licensee of Freezy Freakies and started to manufacture a line of children's 
jackets made from a color-treated polyurethane fabric. The bomber jackets and 
parkas -- whose graphic designs change color when the temperature falls -- are 
priced from $60 to $80 and sold through the J.C. Penney mail-order catalogue 
and in smaller specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
The color changes on the clothes are mainly for effect. But eventually, the 
company hopes to use the fabric for environmentally sensitive clothing that can 
adjust to any climate change. For example, a jacket might turn white to reflect 
unnecessary heat, then turn a dark color to absorb warm rays when the 
temperature drops. 
</P>
<P>
Though many of the new fibers are reserved for sports, some are moving into 
moderate to better-priced non-athletic activewear. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Sport, a division of the Dallas-based Sunny South Fashions Inc., used 
Supplex in its spring '90 line, and again for spring '91. But because it is 
pricey, Supplex will not be featured in the summer line, explains designer 
Debbie Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We save it for big seasons, fall and spring, for our active and weekend wear," 
says Castillo. Though Sunny Sport was one of the first companies selected to 
test Supplex, it may also be one of the first to discontinue it, Castillo 
explains, citing concerns over a saturation in less prestigious retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The fabric is all over the market in a variety of price ranges -- including 
the racks at Walmart and K mart," Castillo says.

DISCOVERY: THE RAFT RESTAURANT

Located just a few streets down from kitschy restaurants such as the Cannery 
and the Crab Cooker, the Raft Restaurant is easy to miss. And the faded cursive 
lettering painted on the front window is a sure indicator you won't find an 
attendant in the washroom. You can, however, expect some surprises as soon as 
the screen door squeaks closed behind you. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's no black-clad hostess asking you to wait patiently at least half 
an hour for any available table when what you really want is a table with a 
classic Newport Harbor view, and soon. At the Raft only waterfront patio 
seating is available. There are no waiters bearing sticker-shock menus and a 
need to get to know you on a first-name basis. And you'll find no string of 
support troops pouring water, busing tables and dishing out stone-cold pats of 
butter. Truth is, Hedi Apodaca, an affable German native, serves as owner, 
greeter, waitress, chef and dishwasher. She also seasons this tiny Cannery Row 
eatery with its Old World flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve years ago, I fell into this business," Apodaca said. "A cousin of mine 
found this place and, although I didn't have any restaurant experience, 
something in me wanted to give it a try. My first thought was to keep 
everything very simple." And she has been true to the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Although the restaurant has a nautical name, don't expect to find a fish-laden 
menu. The name came with the place, and doesn't reflect the menu at all. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Apodaca has put together a basic breakfast menu: you can get 
your eggs scrambled or you can have an omelette. You can have toast with that, 
too. And maybe some hash browns. That's it. Lunchtime offers a smorgasbord of 
sandwiches, salads, pizza (made with Apodaca's own pizza sauce recipe) and 
bowls of chili as thick as her Berchtesgaden accent. And she makes cheesecakes 
from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner begins with a handwritten sign in the front window boasting "B-B-Q 
Dinner-Every Fri. &amp; Sat. Nite." And the simplicity begins again. 
</P>
<P>
Apodaca sets out pots of homemade sauerkraut, baked beans, potato salad -- and 
diners help themselves. Two entree choices complete the menu (chicken shish 
kabob served with bratwurst is a favorite among regulars). Out on the patio, 
Apodaca fires up the barbecue and proceeds to grill the meat to juicy 
perfection. Evening meals are strictly a summer luxury, and will end after 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Long hours don't appear to take any toll on the gregarious restaurateur. Dinner 
offers Apodaca a chance to chat with customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple," she said. "As long as the people are here, I'll be here too. 
After that, I won't be." Variety may be the spice of life, but Apodaca has 
proven simplicity can be the main course. 
</P>

BOB HOPE GOLF TOURNEY HOPE-LESS BUT SUCCESSFUL

No Hope 
</P>
<P>
They called it the "Bob Hope-Howard House Golf Tournament," but it was 
Hope-less. Organizers of Monday's charity tourney at the Mesa Verde Country 
Club in Costa Mesa were certain the big guy would show. Instead, he sent his 
wife, Dolores. "He came down with a flu or a stomach ailment and he had a sty 
on his eye and he was just back from Vegas so he was real tired," explained 
Gloria Osbrink, who heads the local support group for the House Ear Institute 
in Los Angeles -- the fund-raiser's beneficiary. Osbrink said she found out 
that Hope wasn't coming to the tournament shortly after golfers teed off 
Monday. "His agent called the club," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tee for $250 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one foursomes ponied up $1,000 each and a hundred others paid $50-per 
for a post-links filet mignon dinner in the clubhouse. Tourney organizer 
Osbrink, who co-founded the fund-raising group with Athalie Clarke three years 
ago, estimated net proceeds of about $70,000. Renown ear surgeon Dr. Howard 
House parked his clubs on the fourth tee and whacked one up the fairway with 
each group.

Buzzing in from the links at cocktail hour, the golfers left the sunshine and 
tree-spiked vistas for silent auction bidding in a lounge with a full-service 
bar a chip shot away. How did it go out there? "We were great," said John 
Parry, who played the "best ball" scramble round with Matt Schafnitz and Gary 
Boudreau. "I might as well start lying about it now." Duke Cooper hunkered down 
at a window seat with his golf mates Chet Houston, Bill Dawson and Joe Van Der 
Meulen. "It's a nice, sporty course," Cooper said. "We tried to be sporty, 
too," Dawson added. Harry Boand and his wife, Jaynne, carded 74 with their Big 
Canyon neighbors Betty Jane and Dick Smith. Karen and Frank Amelio of San Diego 
kicked out the jams with partners Damian Seiler and Dan Chambers -- a lean 60 
on a par-71 course. "We went nuts," Seiler said. But that wasn't the only 
thrill of the day for the Amelios. "My husband had surgery (at the House Ear 
Institute) in '84, six months before we got married," Karen said. "I met Dr. 
House today and thanked him for my husband's life."

Famously nipped and tucked comedian Phyllis Diller -- a former patient of the 
good doctor House -- stirred the rubberneckers and shoulder-shovers in the 
crowd into action when she arrived for cocktails. She wore green knickers and a 
huge diamond "P" dangling on her neck, and she popped her eyes wide for every 
camera turned her way. For celeb-hunters, there were also singer/dancer Nanette 
Fabray, TV actor Claude Akins and a man introduced at dinner as "Don Porter -- 
remember Gidget's father? Remember Sally Field's father?"

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MIDEAST: WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND A DEARTH OF KNOWLEDGE

<TEXT>
<P>
Finding something positive in the Persian Gulf crisis is as easy as finding a 
needle in a sand dune. But try this. 
</P>
<P>
Education. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when the only knowledge most of us had about the port of Aqaba 
was that Peter O'Toole led an Arab army that took it from the Turks in 
"Lawrence of Arabia." Big movie, bigger information gap. 
</P>
<P>
As ongoing war preparations in the Gulf area have intensely focused our 
attention on this region about which most Americans previously knew very 
little, however, we've become a little smarter than we were before Iraq's Aug. 
2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
If Vietnam was the living-room war, then this has been the living-room war 
buildup. Whether TV, radio or newspapers, there's no escaping this story, which 
has made hostages of the media (including some TV critics) just as Iraq 
President Saddam Hussein has made hostages of Westerners and others under his 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Other major stories rarely rate more than headlines in those reedy 22-minute 
network newscasts that these days are stuffed with news of U.S.-Iraqi tensions. 
In some cases, other news just ceases to exist. In the last three weeks, in 
fact, ABC, CBS and NBC each has aired newscasts that contained stories only 
about the Gulf turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
It's a trade-off. Although viewers are at least temporarily dumber about the 
world, they're surely a little wiser about Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Just as TV coverage of the uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip earlier humanized the Palestinian quest for nationhood, coverage of the 
Gulf crisis has gone still further in shattering the stereotype here of Arabs 
as a Middle East monolith with the face of an oil sheik or terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen now are many Arab faces -- from Iraq to Saudi Arabia to Jordan -- 
each with a distinct personality. The media coverage has been at least an 
introductory course on Arabs for many United States viewers, if somewhat short 
of an in-depth lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the complexities are becoming better known," Jawad George, executive 
director of the National Assn. of Arab Americans, said from Washington. "I 
think the (American) people have seen that the Arab governments have different 
interests and objectives, and that not all Arabs are attacking American 
objectives. The differences in life being found by American troops in Saudi 
Arabia (and reported on by TV and newspapers) are another way of projecting the 
Arab culture." 
</P>
<P>
But will this quickie course dissolve the thick residue of ignorance and 
prejudice built up over years? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that in a crisis of this sort, one has the opportunity to undo 
40 years of the negative caricaturing that has taken place," said James Zogby, 
executive director of the Arab-American Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Zogby likens this once-runaway negativism to "a bus coming at you 100 m.p.h.," 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The media have finally said, 'Stop! We're now defending the people (the 
Kuwaitis and Saudis) we have been defaming as oil sheiks with illegitimate 
wealth. They are now the good guys.' But the difficulty is that we have not 
gained any deeper insight into their culture and the Gulf that we had before. 
So we'll go on to another crisis without any understanding of what got us into 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
Zogby and George both praise CNN's coverage of the Gulf crisis. "I don't know 
the background of Jim Clancy (CNN's first correspondent in Baghdad, Iraq, 
during the crisis)," Zogby said, "but whatever it is, he got his feet on the 
ground real quick and has just been extraordinarily good in bringing excellent 
people to the table. And his commentary has been impeccable." 
</P>
<P>
That's in contrast, Zogby believes, to the reporting by many of Clancy's 
counterparts. The problem is that most of the Gulf reporting is being done by 
generalists (CBS correspondent Robert Simon is one exception who comes to mind) 
with only superficial knowledge of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Mosques and other Middle East scenes make for a dramatic setting, but these 
props in many cases are little more than a sort of wallpapering of the news. 
</P>
<P>
There should be more to the coverage, Zogby said, than "sending in anchors who 
become like tourists, getting backdrop shots and interviewing the big guy (a 
head of state or high-ranking official) with no understanding of . . . the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Zogby any easier on the countless recyclable pundits who have been 
showing up on TV during the Gulf crisis. Zogby, who holds a doctorate in 
Islamic studies, himself has done done up to 80 media interviews -- "about 
normal for a crisis of this type" -- since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But he 
credits only NBC's "Today" program and CNN's "Crossfire" (on which he appeared 
Monday) with welcoming the "new voices and new perspectives" of Arab-Americans 
on the Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Zogby says, he and other Arab-Americans are asked to comment only on 
issues directly concerning other Arab-Americans. "The pundits they interview 
about issues are the ones who have very little knowledge about the Middle East 
area." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he lambasts Henry Kissinger, who has been a frequent advice-giver 
on TV during the crisis. "No one stops and asks how come he is wrong all the 
time," Zogby said. "He's wrong because he has literally stopped functioning 
except to do these kinds of shows." 
</P>
<P>
Media and short memories go together. Thus, pundits who turn out to be wrong 
during this Middle East crisis -- whether Kissinger or Zogby himself -- will 
get the opportunity to be wrong again during the next one.

L.A. FESTIVAL: NEW BUS LINES, PARK-AND-RIDE FACILITIES ARE PLANNED TO HANDLE 
100,000 PEOPLE OVER THREE DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival and Dept. of Transportation officials are planning 
park-and-ride facilities, shuttles and buses to handle the more than 100,000 
people predicted to flock to San Pedro's Point Fermin/Angel's Gate Park this 
weekend over three days of opening activities for the $5-million, 230-event 
gala. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the crowds, the Dept. of Transportation is pumping more than $60,000 
into the park-and-ride sites; and more than 175 signs, 40 Explorer Scouts, 25 
traffic officers and 10 Transportation Dept. engineers will direct drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Police and residents of the district are concerned that the area -- which has 
only two access roads and severe parking problems as it is -- won't be able to 
handle the influx. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they'll squeeze that many people in there. It's going to be a 
madhouse to say the least," said Jeff Hamilton, LAPD's senior lead officer for 
the Angel's Gate area. "I don't understand where they're going to park those 
cars. These neighborhoods are going to be inundated." 
</P>
<P>
"Where they're going to put that many people is beyond me," said Joseph 
Drabinski, a park ranger who regularly patrols the area. "The Fourth of July 
was the most crowded we've ever had -- and there was, I'd say, 350 people in 
the area. And they were triple-parked then." 
</P>
<P>
But festival officials said they will be ready. Drivers entering the area will 
be directed to three park-and-ride sites -- one at White Point Park (where the 
city is grading about 15 acres to create room for 2,000 vehicles), and the 
others four miles away at Terminal Island's Berth 87 and Todd Shipyard. Between 
them, nearly 8,000 vehicles can be parked at one time, according to festival 
consultant Warren Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
"The flow of traffic down Gaffey Street (the main road into Angel's Gate) is 
really going to be directed toward the park-and-ride lots," said Christensen, 
noting that only residents, handicap-permitted vehicles and those with special 
festival passes would be allowed into the Angel's Gate area. When exiting off 
the Harbor Freeway, all vehicles will go through two checkpoints leading them 
to the Terminal Island sites. Those that continue past those points will be 
directed from Gaffey onto westbound 25th Street toward the White Point Park 
park-and-ride area. 
</P>
<P>
But despite 16 RTD buses scheduled to shuttle festivalgoers to performance 
sites every three minutes, Hamilton doubted the festival could accommodate 
8,000 cars. He said the Terminal Island spots are normally taken up by vehicles 
parked for weekend cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton expects drivers will still attempt to park in the beach lots and 
residential neighborhoods -- which, he said, are jam-packed by 9 a.m. on normal 
holiday weekends -- closer to the venue. 
</P>
<P>
That expectation has left some area residents worried. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors here are very concerned about this," said Irene Goldstone, who 
heads the Point Fermin Residents Festival Committee and chairs the San Pedro 
Neighborhood Committee, both of which were formed in response to the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about parking and traffic, we're concerned what people will do 
for restroom facilities, we're concerned about vandalism . . . and we're 
concerned about emergency response teams being able to get to us if we need 
them," said Goldstone. In June she circulated an unsuccessful petition -- 
signed by 25 area homeowners -- to have the event moved. 
</P>
<P>
"The program they're putting on is marvelous," she said. "But why have it here, 
where there's no access and no parking? To sacrifice the whole neighborhood for 
one event isn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstone said residents are dreading a repeat of problems encountered during 
the 1986 L.A. Beach Scene. That event, featuring two days of rock concerts at 
nearby Cabrillo Beach, drew 200,000 people and scores of complaints from angry 
neighbors who said attendees urinated on their lawns, threw beer bottles on the 
street, vandalized the area and caused traffic to back up for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said, however, that police expected no such problems at the L.A. 
Festival because alcohol will not be sold and the arts crowd is not expected to 
be "of the type that will cause problems." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Harbor Division police are planning "maximum deployment" for a 
holiday weekend in the area -- nine patrol cars and 10 additional officers. At 
least two park rangers and a few reserve officers will also be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
While some doubt that the opening events of the festival, which has suffered 
from low public awareness, will bring a large crowd, Christensen said his 
estimate of 33,000 per day is based on his experience with more than 40 arts 
festivals in Los Angeles. He added that he expects every festival staff member 
and volunteer to bring about 10 friends -- thus accounting for a readymade 
crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 attendees in addition to those who learned of the 
festival through ads, newspaper accounts and word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 artist groups are scheduled to perform during the three-day 
opening weekend on six stages constructed throughout the 33-acre Point Fermin 
Park, the 110-acre Angel's Gate Park and the 15-acre Wilder Park. Connecting 
the three will be a Festival Village with 50 vendor booths.

STAGE: PROTEST AND BREAD BAKING ARE THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR VERMONT'S BREAD AND 
PUPPET THEATER. THE DURABLE, '60S-ERA TROUPE OPENS HERE FRIDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In this pastoral corner of the Northeast Kingdom, it seems like ancient history 
to think of the Bread and Puppet Theater as a vital product of New York City. 
That was back in the '60s, when America was swirling in anti-war sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Most theaters of turmoil bit the dust when the Vietnam War and the flower 
children faded. Bread and Puppet moved north. And with the depth of conviction 
of its founder, Peter Schumann, remained ideologically intact. 
</P>
<P>
In its new dwelling place -- the old Dopp Farm on a winding, two-lane road 
lined with burdock and chokeberries a few miles south of here -- Bread and 
Puppet redefined itself and endured. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century farmhouse and its groaning barn, which is now the Bread and 
Puppet Museum, have become a backcountry tourist stop. The barn leaks when it 
rains. It is filled with what Schumann calls Cheap Art: the banners, masks, 
prints, posters and puppets that chronicle the company's history -- or "The Art 
of Impermanence." 
</P>
<P>
And yet the Bread and Puppet Theater (the name derives from the company's 
ritual of passing out home-baked bread dipped in oil and garlic to its 
audiences, and from its use of puppets of all shapes and sizes) has been 
anything but impermanent. What's amazing is that it is not a relic. It is 
ageless -- paradoxically childlike and primitive in spirit, yet addressing 
itself, with a metaphysical edge, to complex contemporary issues. 
</P>
<P>
Schumann (a musician, sculptor and painter as well as theater artist) 
attributes this style to his influences: folklore, medieval art, Dadaism and 
German Expressionism. The result is a company whose epic collective works 
combine a theater of protest with the pageantry of the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Some of it comes our way for the first time this week, as part of the L.A. 
Festival. "Metropolitan Indian Report," a piece about the plight of the 
American underclasses will be presented in UCLA's Little Theatre Friday through 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Uprising of the Beast," which has a 40-foot puppet, angels, animals, skeletons 
and evil dwarfs, will be staged in a hangar at Santa Monica Airport Sept. 14 
and 15. As Schumann explains it, "It tries to dislodge the curious 
Judeo-Christian notion that the world was created to be dominated by human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
The Teatro Mundi pageant will be part of Chinatown's Moon Festival Sunday at 
Union Station and performed again in other venues. 
</P>
<P>
The company subsists mainly by doing what it will do here: touring and 
participating in parades. 
</P>
<P>
The sight the old brightly decorated Bread and Puppet school buses lumbering 
down the road, like painted dinosaurs, is familiar in Vermont. But the company 
has traveled the nation and the world. And rather than shrink its performance 
style to make it more portable it relies, wherever it goes, on small armies of 
volunteers, many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
The Bread and Puppet farm functions as a revolving door. Between four and eight 
people are with it full time, a bigger number come and go, and a still bigger 
number help out in the summer with the company's annual Domestic Resurrection 
Circus. 
</P>

Schumann places responsibility for his bread baking on "the bad conscience of 
an artist." He bakes daily, "Silesian sourdough rye," he says, "ground freshly 
on a hand grinder. As good as good can be." It's been 29 years since he left 
Germany, but the accent lingers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our artmaking obviously doesn't make sense," he continued. "It serves 
a culture that, in itself, doesn't make sense and doesn't doesn't need the 
services of art, because it has organized what it calls entertainment or 
relaxation exercises in a manipulative way. It's made them part of the market 
system. The artist feels like the son of the village idiot. A bread baker can 
get away from all this." 
</P>
<P>
One of five children, Schumann was born in Silesia 56 years ago, learning to 
bake at his mother's knee. As a young man, he traveled Europe studying design, 
music, sculpture and dance, hoping to find a way to combine them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, he married Elka Scott, an American student he met in Munich, and, 
after attending a concert by John Cage and Merce Cunningham, began to think 
that the United States might welcome his ideas. So in 1961, he moved his 
growing family to New York where, after struggling as a sculptor, he began 
working with masks and dance at the Judson Church. When Elka took a teaching 
post at a Vermont boarding school, Peter joined her and taught puppetry. 
</P>
<P>
So it began. By 1963 the Schumanns and their five children were back in New 
York where Bread and Puppet evolved, becoming known as much for its unique 
anti-war pageants, voter-registration and rent-strike parades, as for 
Schumann's custom of baking and breaking bread with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1970 and '74, Bread and Puppet made its way north, first as resident 
theater at Vermont's Goddard College, then by settling into the old Dopp Farm. 
Elka's parents had bought it a few years earlier and offered to rent -- later 
donate -- some buildings to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Vietnam conflict and the move out of the city were big changes 
for the company. "We had to learn to live in the countryside, to use it to make 
these landscape architecture puppetry pieces. We also find it not so 
interesting any more to go inside theaters," Schumann said, lapsing into German 
sentence structure. "The expense of tickets is so forbidding. Also the 
atmosphere -- the feeling that you play for a specialized clientele and not for 
everybody. We concluded it was better to go into a community and invite its 
members into our show." 
</P>
<P>
The free, two-day Domestic Resurrection Circus held in August is part of that 
wish "to make more all-encompassing theater and to do that by choosing big 
scenes that are meaningful for big, non-elite audiences, in the tradition of 
Asiatic or Greek cyclic theater." 
</P>
<P>
A touring version was started in 1969 and refined at Goddard. The nearby 
30-acre field they perform in now includes a big clay oven Schumann built where 
he and a helper bake 1,500 loaves a day. It features up to 20 sideshows and 
involves some 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in white shirt and trousers under a straw hat, shaping loaves on the 
bread-house counter, Schumann is a man engaged in a sacrament. The graying 
beard and mustache that cover much of his face, leave an unobstructed view of 
his transcendent blue eyes that seem to look inward, as if in a communion of 
thought and action. Yet his handshake, extended on another occasion, is pure 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen thousand to 20,000 people attend the circus each year. The relationship 
with the community has had its ups and downs, but neighbors make a bit of 
change by charging to park and camp. This buys the theater some good will. 
"This is conservative country. People mind our politics. Expressing our views 
publicly is not only not wanted, but makes for hostility. Sometimes we don't 
get invited back," Schumann said. 
</P>
<P>
"Or they call and say in a concerned voice, that they don't want any 
controversy," added Michael Romanyshyn, a puppeteer who's been with the company 
off and on since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Vermont is a conservative state, but its Republican politics are independent," 
said John Bell, a now-and-then member since '73. "The focus is on doing 
whatever you want but respecting the right of your neighbors to do the same. 
That fits in with what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Schumann does not consider himself a sculptor who wandered into theater. "Even 
in high school I was more into mask-making," he said. The puppets are created 
by what he calls "Stone Age methods." The clay is local, mostly dug out with 
buckets from the riverbed and used and reused for the basic building. The paper 
for making puppets is donated by a friend and comes from an industrial garbage 
bin in New Jersey. So the bulk of the materials is cheap or free. 
</P>
<P>
Is Bread and Puppet then a one-man band with a lot of unpaid help? Romanyshyn 
says no. 
</P>
<P>
"That's too one-dimensional. There's something in it for people on every level 
that makes them want to do it. People who participate on the musical level. 
People who invent individual dances, text, dialogue. Peter directs the show, 
180 people perform it." 
</P>
<P>
He and Bell prefer to think of Schumann as a philosophical ringmaster whose 
work is very different from, say, that of Robert Wilson. Schumann's is looser 
and less predetermined. Says Bell: "It needs somebody to invent a movement for 
a puppet or propose a piece of music or propose a text or a story. It's always 
drawing you in. A lot of the rehearsal process is improvisation, but (the 
finished product) is not improvised at all." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Romanyshyn: "I think the end result is very precise."

LIFE BACKSTAGE HAS TAUGHT A LOT TO PACIFIC'S ASSISTANT CONDUCTOR; 
</P>
<P>
SINCE JOINING THE ORCHESTRA DURING ITS TIME OF TURMOIL, LUCAS RICHMAN HAS 
LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONFIDENCE AND FAST WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Backstage at every Pacific Symphony concert, ready to take over in case 
"anything unforeseen happens," stands assistant conductor Lucas Richman. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, every guest conductor of the orchestra has stayed remarkably, 
unspeakably, fit and trim, so Richman, 26, has remained the standby rather than 
the kid who goes on stage a rookie and walks off a star. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes with the territory," Richman said Monday from New York, where he was 
finishing leading a monthlong training workshop in musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just inherent with the position. But the opportunity to work with such an 
orchestra and really learn the repertoire can't be compared with anything 
else," he said. "It can be very gratifying, and it's good training to be able 
to rehearse quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Richman was appointed assistant to the Pacific in 1988 when the orchestra was 
undergoing its greatest internal turmoil because the board had not renewed the 
contract of founding music director Keith Clark. Clark had said that he had not 
even been included in the process of selecting Richman. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, morale was low when I came in, but that has completely turned around," 
Richman said. "I feel very good about the opportunities I've had these past two 
years, even though I was kind of thrown into the fire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The first concert I had was a pops concert where the repertoire I had selected 
was very difficult, and I had only an hour's worth of rehearsal. But it set a 
momentum that has been picking up and picking up ever since then." 
</P>
<P>
Richman said that in the last two years he has grown in "confidence and being 
able to trust myself, never allowing the situation to get the best of me and 
ultimately letting the music be the most important thing. I know how to study 
scores quickly now and rehearse efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not just making music when you're standing in front of an orchestra. 
You're dealing with many different personalities, not instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly I'm younger than a good three-quarters of the orchestra members, so 
I've had to learn how to be respectful of their abilities, while at the same 
time guiding a performance to highlight the music -- what the composer, I 
think, originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
"The orchestra can very quickly sum up somebody who stands up on the podium. 
And I haven't felt bad vibes when I get up on the podium. I feel generally 
they've been very supportive, and I appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of UCLA and USC, Richman studied violin with Alexander Treger and 
conducting with Daniel Lewis. He was associate conductor of the Young Musicians 
Foundation Debut Orchestra in Los Angeles from 1984 to 1987 and was one of four 
conductors selected in 1988 by Leonard Bernstein to share the podium for 
concerts presented in London and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Richman actually leads the orchestra more than subscribers may realize. In 
addition to his conducting duties Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
Richman regularly leads the orchestra's concerts in Orange County schools and 
the Saturday morning children's series at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That series has become so popular, incidentally, that the number of concerts 
offered had to be doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working with kids," Richman said. "If anything, doing programs for the 
kids can be a very humbling sort of experience because they can be the most 
critical audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm able to learn how to do children's programming efficiently and with 
excitement and with an educational twist to it, and do it well, then I know the 
opportunity for conducting the standard classical repertoire will come up. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've learned is patience. In this business, that's a good quality to 
have." 
</P>
<P>
For the in-school and Saturday morning concerts, Richman picks repertory and 
writes scripts that are "very friendly to the kids so that the presentation is 
not an intimidating one." 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, there is never enough time to rehearse," he said. "For kids' 
concerts, I get only one rehearsal, and because of scheduling problems, that 
sometimes is not immediately before the concert date. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm learning how to make the best of every situation. This will prepare me 
for anything that I will encounter after Pacific Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
While he has been at the Pacific, Richman also has been teaching in the music 
and theater departments at UCLA. He has been composing, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fortunate enough that things have come my way," he said. "Right now, 
I also have a number of commissions to write large works. I have a commissioned 
oratorio performance (for the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in Simi Valley) next 
summer, and I'm also working on an opera and a musical theater piece." 
</P>
<P>
While he hasn't laid out a timetable by which he would measure his success, he 
said his ideal future would combine the careers of composing and conducting. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have the luxury of composing and guest-conducting within five 
years on a regular basis," he said. "That equal balance between the two would 
make me very happy. Through my composing, I think I'll be able to get the 
conducting opportunities. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I can only move from one project to the next. Sure, I have dreams of 
certain orchestras I would like to work with and places I'd like to perform at. 
But I know the ropes, and I understand the paths traditionally followed to get 
there. So it's about hanging in there and studying." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Richman will conduct the Pacific Symphony in works by Falla, Ravel, 
Bizet and Gershwin at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Nelson Freire will be soloist. Tickets: $8.50 
to $37.50. Lawn seating: $8.50. Information: (714) 474-4233.

<P>

<P>
CONDUCTOR SEARCH: South Coast Symphony music director Larry Granger is one of 
four finalists for the conductor's position with the Santa Cruz County 
Symphony. As part of the selection process, Granger will conduct the orchestra 
on Feb. 23 and 24. A decision is expected to be made in spring, 1991. Granger 
said Tuesday that if he is offered the post, he doesn't expect to abandon his 
duties with South Coast Symphony.

Box-Office Update: 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen shows are sold out and festival officials now expect to surpass the 
60% capacity originally predicted for 230 ticketed programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sold out are all five performances of "The Temptation of St. Anthony" by New 
York's Wooster Group, four Bread and Puppet Theater shows, three evening shows 
by performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, three of eight "Jupiter 35" programs by 
Los Angeles Poverty Department, and opening nights of "The Legend of the Water 
Flame" and performance artist Guillermo Gomez Pena. 
</P>
<P>
An additional Rosenthal matinee has been added Sept. 16 at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All $40 tickets for Royal Court Dancers' program at the Arboretum as well as 
the Cambodians' performances there are sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Festival officials have upped projected ticket revenue figures from $600,000 to 
$650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dial Some Familiar Voices 
</P>
<P>
The days of Orson Welles and radio dramas like "This Is Your FBI," "The 
Shadow," "Sam Spade," "Dragnet" and "The Life of Riley" have been brought back 
to life on the CARS telephone hot line: (213) 688-ARTS. The computer-operated 
service began Sunday, listing events in both the curated festival and the 
connected Open Festival by date, discipline and, in some cases, by geography. 
Organizers hope that it will provide a form of entertainment besides merely 
giving lists through the voices of such notable old-time radio stars as Les 
Tremayne (a veteran of some 30,000 radio programs), Parley Bear (Chester in 
"Gunsmoke"), Robert Rockwell (Philip Boynton in "Our Miss Brooks") and Vance 
Colvig (the original Bozo the Clown); other recognizable voices include 
Jeanette Nolan, Peggy Webber, Dick Wilson and Lou Krugman. All are members of 
the Los Angeles-based California Artist Repertory Theater, which has about 100 
members from radio's heyday in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Shamans to Visit Korea Town 
</P>
<P>
Two performances by the Chindo Ssitkim-Kut Korean Shamans have been added 
Sunday at the Korea Town Plaza shopping center at 928 S. Western Ave. A 
traditional ceremony will begin at 2 p.m. and a performance of folk music will 
be held at 3:30 p.m. Information: (213) 623-7400. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivian Sounds 
</P>
<P>
Bolivian music ensemble Miriam Mita Ayllu Sankayo has been added to the Sept. 9 
"Andean Winds" program at UCLA's Sunset Canyon Amphitheater. The group will 
perform traditional Incan music, replacing the originally scheduled Ecuadoran 
ensemble Runa Pacha,(cq) which was dropped from the festival lineup last month 
because of visa problems. A festival spokesman said that no "Around Town" 
performances are currently scheduled for the Bolivian group, although such 
appearances might be added at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic Connection 
</P>
<P>
Philharmonic assistant conductor David Alan Miller will conduct the original 
"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" Sept. 13 at Hollywood Bowl. John Nelson had 
previously been announced as conductor. The Los Angeles Philharmonic/Los 
Angeles Festival program, held in conjunction with a live performance of John 
Adams' "Harmonielehre," is a replacement for festival director Peter Sellars' 
silent-film parody, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez." The program also includes a 
sampler of ethnic music and dance from other festival events.

MOODIES ENGAGING, WITH A LITTLE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A petition was circulating in the audience at the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Monday calling for the induction of headliners the Moody Blues into the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame. The initiative raises the question of whether the 
25-year-old British group, whose embellishment of rock with orchestral 
flourishes spawned a generation of art-rockers, deserves a place next to 
undeniably influential countrymen like the Rolling Stones, the Who and the 
Kinks. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out. 
</P>
<P>
Though such '60s classics as the urgent "Go Now!" (which the current group 
seems to disavow) and the ornately orchestrated "Nights in White Satin" were 
immensely influential in their time, the days of a future may have passed for 
the group. Though they engineered an impressive commercial comeback in the 
'80s, the vitality of their music has faded. 
</P>
<P>
While the group presented a remarkably engaging show on Monday, it could not 
have done so without two backup singers and what appeared to be taped vocals 
augmenting the frayed voices of the lead trio: Justin Hayward, Ray Thomas and 
John Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Only "Your Wildest Dreams" among the newer songs approached the ambition and 
appeal of set staples like "Question" and "Tuesday Afternoon." The relatively 
recent "I Know You're Out There Somewhere," a deliciously tuneful 
crowd-pleaser, is a bit too much of a confection to be included in the ranks of 
Moody music that matters. 
</P>
<P>
If the Moodies are truly serious about earning a place in the Hall of Fame 
before such fellow shutouts as Bob Marley and Del Shannon, their case could be 
helped considerably with a new album worthy of their best work. 
</P>
<P>
Ready for immediate induction into the Hall of Shame is opening act Darling 
Cruel, a bombastic, thunderingly bad ensemble. The L.A. outfit assaulted those 
who dared to stay in their seats with an arsenal of transparently rendered 
Bowie mannerisms and inept heavy-metal posturing. 
</P>
<P>
The Moody Blues will also be at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on 
Thursday, San Diego's Open Air Theatre on Friday and the Santa Barbara County 
Bowl on Monday. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

CHUCK NORRIS RETURNS WITH 'DELTA FORCE 2' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time around, Chuck Norris and his Delta Force, a special unit of the 
U.S. Army, took on some Arab terrorist hijackers. This time, in "Delta Force 2: 
Operation Stranglehold" (citywide), Norris and his cohorts zero in on the 
world's wealthiest drug dealer, wanted in 17 countries. 
</P>
<P>
If the first "Delta Force" played like a formula TV movie, the second is not 
even that. Characterizations are so cardboard and stereotypical and plotting so 
trite that there's not enough involvement generated to be impressed by dramatic 
locales and elaborate parachuting and helicopter stunts. Indeed, it's 
depressing to realize that several stuntmen lost their lives in making this 
dull action/adventure that is most notable for its nonstop violence. 
</P>
<P>
There's precious little opportunity for Norris to express that dry humor he's 
developed over the years as he and others (notably, John P. Ryan's salty 
general and Richard Jaeckel's stalwart DEA agent) try to nail down the elusive, 
vicious drug lord Ramon Cota (Billy Drago, lean, angular and creepy, the 
strongest presence in the picture). Norris' brother Aaron has directed the film 
efficiently and energetically but without any personality. The body count on 
screen is staggering, so immense as to be impossible to track. (The film has 
been rated R for its extreme violence, but you have to wonder what they're 
saving the X for.) 
</P>
<P>
Filmed largely in the Philippines, "Delta Force 2" is set in the fictional 
Latin American country of San Carlos. Curiously, the print caught at a preview 
had in its end credits a different title: "Delta Force 2: The Colombian 
Connection." KEVIN THOMAS

FIAT TO LAY OFF ALMOST A THIRD OF PLANT WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: THE ACTION REFLECTS THE START OF A LONG-EXPECTED WEAKENING IN WEST 
EUROPEAN NEW CAR DEMAND AFTER YEARS OF RECORD SALES. 
</P>

MILAN, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fiat SPA, the Italian automotive and industrial group, is laying off close to a 
third of its Italian car production work force for up to four weeks to cut 
production and reduce bloated stocks in the face of falling domestic and 
international sales. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will affect about 35,000 of the 117,000-strong Fiat Auto work force 
at five of the group's nine car assembly plants in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to cut output by 75,000 units by year-end and reduce 
excess stocks of more than 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs are the most dramatic evidence to date of the start of the 
long-expected weakening in Western European new car demand after five 
consecutive years of record sales. 
</P>
<P>
Fiat is being hardest hit among the big six car makers in Europe. Its share of 
the domestic Italian market dropped to 54.4% in the first six months from 58.1% 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fiat, in second place in the European new car market behind the Volkswagen 
group of West Germany, has suffered an estimated fall of about 4.2% in its 
sales volume across Western Europe in the first seven months of the year, 
compared to a decline of only about 0.3% in the overall market. 
</P>
<P>
Fiat's trade unions reacted calmly to the planned layoffs, but called for more 
details. Workers' representatives, however, called for urgent meetings of the 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Fiat said it thought this year's production would exceed 
the 2.3 million vehicles manufactured in 1989, but forecasts have been revised 
sharply downward after a steep fall in demand in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Fiat group cars, including Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, in the 
Italian market had been "well below expectations," said the company, with a 
decline in the first six months of this year to 740,000 units from 776,000 in 
the same period last year, despite a 1.8% rise in the overall market.

COMPUTER FIRMS HAVE MUCH AT STAKE AS NEW PCS DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's new-model season again for the two most watched, most talked about, most 
fussed over personal computer makers in the Silicon Valley: Apple Computer and 
Next Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, new models from these two media darlings will not be mere 
examples of the latest and greatest of their PC technology. What's at stake is 
renewed corporate strength -- or, in Next's case, corporate survival. 
</P>
<P>
For Next, the critical task is bringing out new models that more customers are 
willing to buy and more software publishers are willing to create programs for. 
Analysts agree that company founder and PC pioneer Steven P. Jobs faces a "bet 
your business" crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last shot for him," said William Zachmann of Canopus Research in 
Duxbury, Mass. If the new machines are "anything less than a minor miracle, the 
Next machine won't amount to much more than an exotic footnote in computer 
history." 
</P>
<P>
For Apple, the challenge is responding to persistent criticism that it has no 
low-cost, entry-level systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple needs something to capture the excitement of customers . . . to give 
them what they say they have been wanting," said Richard Shaffer, a technology 
analyst and PC newsletter publisher in New York. "But it still remains to be 
seen whether the customers still care after they get what Apple has to offer. 
It may not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
The new machines and sharpened corporate strategies hardly come at an ideal 
time. Personal computer sales rates in the United States have slowed 
dramatically during the past year, intensifying competition and sparking a 
price war led by giant International Business Machines. Meanwhile, European 
sales growth, which had been offsetting the stagnating U.S. market, has tapered 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Although overall market conditions have not been kind to Apple, the company has 
brought on some of its own problems, analysts say. It has concentrated on the 
high-priced, turbo-powered end of the PC market and ignored less expensive, 
entry-level systems -- including models for the schools, once the company's 
most important market. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at squelching that criticism, Apple's new-product introduction in October 
will include three new versions of its popular Macintosh line, analysts say. 
The new systems, about which the company declines to comment, will include a 
replacement for the mainstay Macintosh Plus, a new color Mac and a scaled-down 
version of its most popular high-powered system, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Although prices have not been set, sources promise that the new Macs will be 
considerably less expensive than current models -- among the highest-priced PCs 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is filling in a significant gap in its product line," explains Bruce 
Stephen of International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market research firm. 
"This is not a do-or-die situation for them, but it is important if they are 
going to get back into the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Next Inc., Jobs' floundering 5-year-old company, is set to show off his latest 
system Sept. 18 in the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco. That's 
the same 3,000-seat auditorium that Jobs packed with a standing-room-only crowd 
two years ago when he unveiled the initial Next machine. 
</P>
<P>
This year Jobs will show off new models that are faster, less expensive and 
equipped with color monitors. And, in a major reversal of earlier company 
policy, one or more of the machines will employ floppy disk drives. The initial 
machines were equipped only to handle optical disks, expensive devices that 
software publishers balked at using to distribute their programs. 
</P>
<P>
Further, and perhaps more important, company insiders promise a host of new 
software programs -- a development that would give the machines, now priced at 
$10,000, some sorely needed practical applications. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a privately held company, has declined to reveal its sales rates, saying 
only that its largest sale consisted of 275 machines to the William Morris 
talent agency in Hollywood and New York. But analysts estimate that the company 
has sold 2,000 to 5,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that Next's sales have been slowed by the lack of software 
written for its machine, which cannot use programs developed for other models. 
However, analysts wonder if the new programs promised for release later this 
year will even make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that there is no task for which the Next is the best choice," 
Shaffer says. "While the machine may be nice and elegant, those benefits aren't 
enough to get customers to abandon what they already have." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are uncertain about what Jobs might do if his updated machines prove 
as lackluster at the cash register as his initial version. Jobs isn't likely to 
fold the company entirely, several analysts said, because so much of his 
reputation is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Possible options include selling the company's technology, possibly to its 
Japanese investor, Canon Inc., or working some other deal to change the firm's 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
"For Jobs, it's more ego than business," said Stewart Alsop, a Silicon Valley 
technology analyst. "Jobs will find a way to make the company a success." 
</P>
<P>
Jobs declined to be interviewed for this story, preferring to wait until the 
new models are formally unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in other PC news, IBM said Tuesday that it is proceeding with its 
planned full-scale rollout of its new home computer, the PS/1, after 
test-marketing it in three areas the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
The new systems, priced between $1,000 and $2,000, will be available nationwide 
immediately and in selected stores in Canada and Europe next week.

GULF-RELATED GILT TRIP: GOLD FALLS AS PEACE CHANCES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Disaster potentially averted in the Persian Gulf is translating into disaster 
found for the long-moribund gold market, which staged a brief rally last week 
only to nose-dive after Iraq's first peaceful overtures. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices on the New York Commodities Exchange continued to slide Tuesday, 
losing $3.30 an ounce to close at $385. The metal's value plummeted Monday by 
$27. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices also continued to drop, falling 0.8 cents to $4.84 an ounce. 
Silver prices were off 33.9 cents Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The massive drop this week reflected investors' belief that there is now less 
chance of a war between the United States and Iraq, traders said Tuesday. In 
the past several days, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has indicated a 
willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis and 
has promised to release all women and children hostages held in Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The war premium has been blown," said John Nadler, vice president of precious 
metals trading at Bank of America in San Francisco. "We have more or less 
returned to the levels we saw prior to the Gulf crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the illusions of precious-metal traders -- who expect the value of gold 
to soar in times of political and economic unrest -- are being shattered. Gold 
is trading for a mere $10 more than its price before Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
(Silver tends to trade in tandem with gold, but its value is sometimes 
depressed by an abundant supply.) 
</P>
<P>
Worse still, gold is worth less today than it was five years ago, making it one 
of the worst investments of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen nearly 400 points from its 
high this year, it is still up nearly 38% from 1986. Gold, meanwhile, is worth 
about $10 an ounce less than it was in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, stock investors often earned dividends on their investments, while 
gold investors generally had to pay someone to hold their ever-depreciating 
bullion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is often costly to trade gold, particularly when it comes as 
gold coins. Typically, investors pay 2% to 3% more for gold bullion than they 
would be able to sell it for on the same day, traders said. However, this 
so-called spread on gold coins can be higher, depending on the market and the 
type of coin purchased. That adds further risk to an already volatile 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, gold traders note that the metal has occasionally provided 
gratifying returns. In 1980, for example, gold soared to $850 an ounce from 
about $250 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
And those who purchased "numismatic" gold coins -- those that are rare enough 
to have additional value for collectors -- have found their investment will 
appreciate by 20% to 25% this year, regardless of the Persian Gulf situation, 
said Keith Zaner. He is trends editor at Coin World, a trade publication 
headquartered in Sidney, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Some continue to hold out hope that the market for gold bullion will rally too. 
The Persian Gulf crisis is not resolved, so war could still break out, sending 
the price of gold soaring, Nadler said. Even if war is avoided, U.S. gold 
prices should still rise on the basis of "fundamentals" -- such as high 
interest rates, high inflation, a weak dollar and a generally souring U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably going to continue to see gold prices coming back as inflation 
rises," said Zaner. "But you can't act hastily. Investors have to look at gold 
as a long-term investment." 
</P>
<P>
Yet many analysts believe that the gold market is bound to languish for some 
time, despite the weaker economy and volatile world situation. 
</P>
<P>
Gold is the asset of last resort, meaning that people tend to flock to it only 
when they see little hope for stocks, bonds and currency, said Joseph Wahed, 
senior vice president and chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
And these days, people are simply more confident about the world economy, about 
the value of their own currencies and about their respective banking systems, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, today's economy, although weakening, is in much better shape than in 
1980, when gold prices peaked. A decade ago, inflation was running at 12.5% 
annually and 7% of the nation's workers were unemployed. Meanwhile, the prime 
rate was hovering around 15.3%, according to the Federal Reserve, which made it 
difficult for businesses to borrow and expand. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, inflation is now running at a 4.7% annual clip, the unemployment 
rate is at 5.5% and the prime rate is at 10%.

GULF CRISIS A CHALLENGE TO OPEC'S CREDIBILITY ; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THERE IS GROWING DIVISION AND INCREASED POLITICIZATION AMONG MEMBERS OF 
THE 30-YEAR-OLD PETROLEUM CARTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting Middle East standoff has 
disrupted the workings of the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and for now has rendered it all but irrelevant, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Less clear is whether OPEC will emerge from the current crisis intact, and if 
it does, how it will have changed. Possible scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
* If Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein is ousted and Kuwait is reconstituted as a 
sovereign state, OPEC could survive pretty much as it is, with Saudi Arabia 
back in control. 
</P>
<P>
* If Hussein retains his hold on power when the crisis is resolved, OPEC will 
again be faced with a power struggle between Iraq-led "price hawks," who favor 
high world oil prices and tight supplies, and Saudi-led "price doves," who 
believe in moderate prices and good relations with consuming nations to ensure 
continuous demand. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts argue that the current crisis highlights the growing divisions 
among OPEC members, underscores its politicization and sets the stage for 
defections from the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting conflicts could even lead to the ultimate dissolution of the 
30-year-old organization if disputes escalate further. One scenario would 
dissolve OPEC and create a new mini-cartel of Persian Gulf oil-producing states 
and Venezuela, which already control the majority of OPEC's oil production and 
reserves. Another has the United States taking a much greater role now that it 
has placed troops on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is by far the worst crisis (OPEC) has faced, and it's really a 
battle for the soul of the oil market for the future," said Daniel Yergin, 
president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it going to be one of cooperation between producers and consumers, which 
has been the dominant theme of the last few years, or will it return to the old 
pattern of confrontation, which is what Saddam Hussein was pushing for: using 
the 'oil weapon'? It's a struggle for the hearts and minds of the oil market," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts caution that OPEC has survived previous crises and defied predictions 
of its doom. "It's far too early to write an obituary for OPEC," said Thomas E. 
Wallin, group editor for the widely read newsletter Petroleum Intelligence 
Weekly. During their bitter eight-year Persian Gulf war, for example, Iraq and 
Iran continued to send ministers to OPEC meetings. 
</P>
<P>
What's beyond doubt is that the rules of OPEC's game have changed dramatically. 
Only a month ago, OPEC was wrestling with an overabundance of oil on world 
markets and overproduction by its members. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, the leading price hawk, emerged from a July OPEC meeting as the de facto 
leader of the cartel, signaling a more confrontational stance with consuming 
nations such as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion isolated it from the world economy, and the Middle 
East crisis has ironically thrown control of the organization back to Saudi 
Arabia, the leading price dove, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
In meetings scheduled to resume today, 11 OPEC ministers appeared poised to 
endorse a call by Saudi Arabia to hike production quotas to allow member 
nations to pump out more oil to make up the worldwide shortfall of crude 
resulting from the international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, a move 
designed to keep prices moderate and oil flowing. 
</P>
<P>
But OPEC has nevertheless lost its importance during the current crisis, 
analysts said. For one thing, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have already said they 
will boost production of oil, whether OPEC agrees to lift quotas or not. 
</P>
<P>
"This OPEC informal meeting hasn't got much meaning, but it does provide a nice 
endorsement of what Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were going to do anyway," said 
Joseph Story, a Middle East expert who runs Gulf Consulting Services in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are intended more to preserve the image of OPEC as a going 
concern, said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of Petroleum Finance Co. in 
Washington. "All of this, the meetings and the deliberations and the motions 
they are going through are to keep the door open for tomorrow, . . . to give 
(OPEC) credibility and face." 
</P>
<P>
That credibility may be important once the crisis is resolved. "There's still 
going to be a need to coordinate policies among producers," Zanoyan said. 
</P>
<P>
It was that need that led to the creation of OPEC in the first place -- 
ironically, at a meeting in Baghdad. OPEC was formed in 1960 by representatives 
of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela as a vehicle to wrest control 
of prices from the multinational oil companies that had previously controlled 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel was intended to be strictly apolitical. But "in the last couple of 
years, it has become increasingly clear that oil pricing and production 
decisions are part of the struggle for power within the Middle East," said G. 
Henry Schuler, director of energy security programs at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Nations such as Saudi Arabia that have the most spare production capacity -- 
and therefore the greatest ability to influence world oil markets -- have 
traditionally used OPEC to further their own agendas, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
But the current crisis underlines the split within the cartel among the 
oil-rich states of the Persian Gulf and the non-Gulf states such as Indonesia 
that have fewer reserves. Of the non-Gulf nations, only Venezuela has any 
significant capacity to pump out more oil. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought that those states outside the Middle East who have no 
interest in Middle East politics would find that they've got nothing to gain 
and much to lose by associating themselves with Arab quarrels," Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most analysts believe that inertia, if nothing else, will hold OPEC 
together once the current crisis fades into memory. And it could attract new 
members in a post-Cold War economy. The most likely new member: the Soviet 
Union, the world's largest producer of oil.

UAW CHOOSES GM TALKS TO SET INDUSTRY PATTERN

General Motors Corp. became the strike target of the United Auto Workers on 
Tuesday, but GM welcomed the chance to be the powerful union's top priority in 
bargaining for new auto industry contracts this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We, after deliberation, came to the conclusion unanimously we would go to GM 
for the 1990 target," UAW President Owen Bieber said after union management 
made its decision. 
</P>
<P>
"GM wants to avoid being forced into an expensive agreement negotiated by 
another company," said Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.'s auto industry analyst, 
John Casesa. "Being chosen gives them a say in their destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Contracts between the Big Three car makers and the UAW are among the biggest in 
U.S. manufacturing, covering 500,000 workers. They expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The target designation means that the GM talks will set the pattern for the 
industry, while also concentrating the union's resources for a single showdown, 
if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and Chrysler also sought to be targeted. They felt that the advantage of 
being able to determine the parameters of an initial industry contract 
outweighed the disadvantage of a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of GM, the world's biggest car maker, had been expected. Analysts 
said the key issue for the union, job security, applies most to GM. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of union members at GM have lost their jobs since the last contract 
was signed in 1987. The auto maker has closed a number of plants to bring 
production in line with dwindling sales. 
</P>
<P>
GM publicly welcomed the UAW's decision. Wall Street also appeared to approve, 
boosting GM's shares $1.50 to $40.675 in active trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Now that GM has been targeted, the UAW will break off talks with Ford and 
Chrysler and concentrate on working out an agreement with GM by the contract 
expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
GM will now be in a position not only to negotiate an agreement that benefits 
itself but also one that puts its competitors at a disadvantage, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
GM said being the target company gives it "an opportunity to fashion an 
agreement which addresses the interests of all who have a stake in the success 
of GM, especially those of its employees." 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, GM's selection is only a small victory in what could be 
an arduous battle to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that a prolonged strike would probably benefit Japanese 
manufacturers, and the UAW does not want to cede jobs to Japanese plants in the 
United States because most are non-union. 
</P>
<P>
GM agreed, saying that it believes that a settlement without a strike is the 
only outcome that makes sense, given the serious competitive issues facing GM 
and the UAW.

KERKORIAN PUTS DESERT INN HOTEL ON THE BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
CASINOS: THE PRICE IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN $200 MILLION. THE FINANCIER'S FIRM 
WILL USE THE PROCEEDS TO FINANCE ITS LAS VEGAS THEME PARK. 
</P>

<P>
Financier Kirk Kerkorian on Tuesday placed his Desert Inn Hotel and Casino up 
for sale for an amount believed to exceed $200 million. The Desert Inn is a 
landmark property on the Las Vegas Strip with a colorful history but an 
unimpressive bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand, Kerkorian's majority-owned company in Culver City, has hired the New 
York investment banking firm of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. to conduct a worldwide 
search for a buyer for the 40-year-old casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand intends to use the money from the sale to help finance its 
$700-million theme park on the Strip, scheduled to break ground late this year. 
The huge complex is expected to have a 5,000-room casino-hotel, the world's 
largest, and a 40-acre movie theme park. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Inn was built by resort owner Wilbur Clarke in 1950 and was later 
bought by reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes. The Desert Inn was one of several 
casinos that Hughes bought during a frenetic buying spree in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Around Las Vegas, the Desert Inn is known as a high-class "boutique" 
casino-hotel that is relatively small and caters to high-rollers, particularly 
foreigners. The casino-hotel has several marketing offices in Mexico, Taiwan 
and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign accent has sparked speculation that investors from Japan are the 
most logical buyers for the Desert Inn. "That's possible," MGM Chairman Fred 
Benninger said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
According to Benninger, MGM Grand has spent $45 million to refurbish the Desert 
Inn and an additional $30 million for an adjacent golf course. Although 
Benninger declined to put a price on the property, Bear Stearns Vice Chairman 
Michael E. Tennenbaum said that "it is my personal opinion that we will be able 
to sell it for in excess of $200 million." 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Inn had an operating profit of $10 million last year, making it one 
of the less profitable properties on the glitzy Strip. "It's certainly not one 
of the top moneymakers in town," said a top executive at a rival casino 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes lived in seclusion in the Desert Inn's penthouse suite from 1966 until 
he mysteriously departed on Thanksgiving Day, 1970. Hughes left the country and 
died six years later. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian acquired the Desert Inn in 1987 for $167 million, a price that also 
included the nearby Sands Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand later sold the Sands for $110 million to investors from New England. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Inn property includes the casino-hotel, which has 821 rooms, and the 
golf course, as well as 34 acres of vacant land next to the hotel.

WestAir Is Streamlining: Commuter-flight operator WestAir Holding Inc. of 
Fresno said it will close its United Express regional headquarters in Pasco, 
Wash., to reduce management costs. The closure, which will eliminate about 75 
jobs, is unlikely to disrupt commuter service in the Northwest, WestAir said. 
After the restructuring, WestAir will have an Atlantic coast division operating 
from Dulles Airport near Washington and a West Coast division operating from 
hubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Sacramento and Fresno.

Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Tuesday that President Bush has "substituted 
a military policy for an energy policy" in sending troops to defend Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said at a news conference that the Bush Administration lacks a clear 
energy policy and that opposition Democrats have failed to find an alternative 
to reliance on imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
He urged Congress to adopt new average fuel-efficiency standards of 45 miles 
per gallon for new cars by 2000, a move that would reduce gasoline sales by at 
least 20% and curb dependence on imported oil. The most stringent legislation 
pending in Congress would raise average fuel economy to 40 miles per gallon by 
2000 from the current level of 27. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said conservation, greater fuel efficiency for cars and using more power 
from such sources as wood, water and the sun offered a realistic alternative to 
more imports from the Middle East. The United States imports about half of the 
17.5 million barrels of oil it uses daily. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said no one in the Administration has an energy plan.

DOW EKES OUT 3.22 GAIN IN LIGHT TRADING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks closed mixed Tuesday, failing to build convincingly on the big advances 
of the prior two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was light as traders awaited fresh developments from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.22 to close at 2,614.85 after soaring 
78.71 on Monday, its best performance in more than 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the Dow's 49-point advance Friday, the index has risen 131 points 
in the past three sessions, or 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market Tuesday, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 
margin of about 5-to-4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed 
stocks, with 837 up, 664 down and 492 unchanged. But Big Board volume was a 
light 127.65 million shares, versus 160.15 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two magnificent days up -- Friday and Monday -- and the market is 
acting as if both the buyers and the sellers are exhausted and out of 
conviction," said Alfred Goldman, director of technical research at A. G. 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take some news, good or bad, to get the market really shaking in 
one direction or another short term," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's hope out there that we're coming closer to some sort of a 
breakthrough on the Mideast situation," said Ron Doran, director of 
institutional trading at C. L. King &amp; Associates. "If this thing gets 
defused, there will be an upturn and (investors) don't want to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's decision to allow women and children hostages 
to leave Iraq today had little impact on stock prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a case that there's no need for investors to make a commitment," 
said Dennis Jarrett, strategist at Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Goldman said he was encouraged that most stocks held their ground 
despite another rise in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Among key indexes, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.10 to 321.34, but the 
NASDAQ over-the-counter composite gained 1.59 to 382.86. Buying was strongest 
among many high-tech OTC issues. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks accounted for most of the Dow's gain. Chevron rose 1 1/8 to 75 
5/8, Texaco added 1 3/4 to 62 3/4 and Exxon rose 1/2 to 50 1/8. Also, Arco 
gained 1 7/8 to 134 1/8 and Amoco jumped 1 3/8 to 55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among rebounding tech issues, FileNet soared 2 to 15 1/4, Microsoft jumped 2 
1/8 to 62 7/8, Optical Radiation added 1 3/4 to 26 1/2 and Digital Equipment 
rose 1 7/8 to 65 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* GM gained 1 1/8 to 40 1/4 on news that the UAW had selected GM as its strike 
target. GM said it was pleased to have the chance to lead contract negotiations 
for the auto industry, rather than have to follow the lead of Ford or Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
* LA Gear jumped 7/8 to 15 1/4 after trading as high as 16 1/4 on vague buyout 
rumors that named Bennetton as a possible bidder. 
</P>
<P>
* Bargain hunting seemed to dry up in the food and drug groups. General Mills 
rose 1/2 to 85, and Lilly gained 1 1/8 to 73 1/2, but Heinz lost 3/8 to 32 1/4, 
and Bristol Myers slipped 1/8 to 59 3/8. Health-care facility operators, 
however, were strong. Humana rose 1 1/8 to 44 7/8, PacifiCare added 3/4 to 16 
1/2 and Salick Health gained 1/2 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
* In-Store Advertising tumbled 7 1/2 to 7 1/4 after its announcement that 1990 
revenue would fall significantly short of forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks continued their broad advance, picking up from Monday. Falling 
oil prices and a stronger yen fueled advances, but persistent market rumors of 
trouble in the Persian Gulf capped gains. The 225-share Nikkei average closed 
up 569, or 2.3%, to 25,710.76. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in London lost some of their sharp early gains but ended higher on the 
day after strong rallies overseas the previous day. At the close, the Financial 
Times 100-share index was up 39.7, or 1.9%, at 2,126.1. However, in Frankfurt, 
profit taking knocked shares sharply lower after Monday's record 6% rise. The 
30-share DAX index of leading West German shares ended 36.91 lower at 1,617.89.

Bond Prices Decline as Traders Await Cue 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slipped in lackluster trading as the market tried to make sense of 
the Mideast situation, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which shot up nearly $16 per $1,000 in face 
amount Monday, fell 15/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value. Its yield rose 
to 9.04% from 8.99% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi crisis has sent the yield on the so-called long bond to its highest 
levels in more than a year. The figure is important because it is a benchmark 
for mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders said they were watching the Iraqi situation closely and its effect 
on oil prices, but there was little clear direction for the market. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, unchanged from late Monday.

Quiet Session Leaves Dollar Mixed in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar turned mixed in domestic trading after finishing mostly higher 
overseas, but much of the day's activity centered on other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was relatively quiet as fears of a worsening Middle East conflict 
receded. "Nothing has happened (in the Persian Gulf) so far, so the market is 
beginning to think it is less of a concern," said Linda McLaughlin, a trader at 
Chemical New York Capital Markets Group. "The market is quite comfortable not 
to worry." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed in New York at 143.75 Japanese yen versus 144.25 Monday. It 
was the lowest close since 142.95 on Jan. 29. But the dollar rose to 1.556 
German marks from 1.551 Monday.

Grain and Soybeans 'Trade on Both Sides' 
</P>
<P>
Prices of grain and soybean futures were mixed in light trading on the Chicago 
Board of Trade, as spot oil prices rebounded and gold and silver lost more 
ground. (See related stories.) 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were taking a wait-and-see attitude after Monday's sharp 
decline of prices in the grain market. The selloff was tied to the drop in 
crude oil and precious metals prices. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, cocoa prices plummeted at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in 
New York on profit taking and news of beneficial rain in west African growing 
areas, after sharp gains Friday.

Birtcher Corp.: The El Monte-based maker of medical instruments said its fiscal 
1990 income fell to $31,000 from $946,000 the year before, reflecting 
non-recurring expenses of about $1 million for discontinuing certain products, 
recorded in the second quarter. Sales rose 60% to $18.3 million. Fourth-quarter 
income more than doubled to $411,000, while sales more than tripled to $6.7

ENERGIZING ANAHEIM ELECTRIC-CAR FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: TWO FORMER ELECTRONICS EXECUTIVES ACQUIRE TAYLOR-DUNN IN HOPE OF 
DOUBLING SALES OF $23 MILLION A YEAR BY EXPANDING THE PRODUCT LINE AND SLASHING 
COSTS WITH MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES.

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taylor-Dunn, a 41-year-old Anaheim manufacturer of electric vehicles, has been 
acquired in an all-cash deal by two former San Fernando Valley electronics 
executives with a strong belief in the future of American manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners, Arthur J. Goodwin and Milton L. Sneller, plan to keep 
Taylor-Dunn in Anaheim and to double current sales of $23 million a year by 
expanding the company's product line and slashing costs with new manufacturing 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Less than six weeks after completion of the multimillion-dollar deal, Goodwin 
is reporting several successes. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting manufacturing theories that give more decision-making authority to 
factory floor workers instead of to one or more supervisors, Taylor-Dunn has 
already seen a 15% reduction in the time it takes the company's 200 workers to 
fill and ship customers' orders, Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to reduce the time for processing orders from months to days, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But more satisfying to Goodwin and Sneller is the first product to roll out of 
the firm's new "skunk works." 
</P>
<P>
The think tank was established to give employees at all levels a say in product 
design, Goodwin said: "We put manufacturing people in the design environment, 
we have them talk to the customers, and then they design products that the 
customers want and that (can be manufactured) efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
Citing competitive pressures, Goodwin would say only that the new product is "a 
utility truck for a new niche in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin said plans call for the company to have 30 or more products by 1992 -- 
up from 20 today -- with sales of $40 million and 300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor-Dunn produces electric utility trucks and tow vehicles -- small versions 
of the giant electric trucks used to move passenger jets around airports. The 
company also imports and assembles Japanese-made golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
For Goodwin and Sneller, both 45, owning Taylor-Dunn fulfills a longtime 
ambition to put into practice the management techniques they have been 
preaching for years. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin, a Northridge resident, founded a Chatsworth circuit board company that 
he later sold to Data Design Laboratories in 1985. He stayed on under a 
five-year management contract that recently expired. 
</P>
<P>
Sneller, a longtime Anaheim resident, was Data design's chief operating officer 
until he resigned late last year to join Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
The two men went hunting early this year "for a company like this," Goodwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and Sneller put up a "substantial" amount of cash and gained more 
financing from Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., the Los Angeles investment banking 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something that was manufacturing-intensive . . . with a reasonable 
share of its market and an excellent name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor-Dunn was not on the market when the two men approached the firm -- one 
of about 20 companies they talked to. "But we made an offer, and they decided 
to sell," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
R. Davis Taylor II, son of the company founder, has agreed to stay on as 
president for a year to help with the transition to new owners, Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
When he and Sneller moved into the administrative offices July 19, Taylor-Dunn 
"was a good, solid company with a 30% share of the market nationally and decent 
sales in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is and was profitable but was run as a traditional, 1950s-style 
manufacturing plant," he said. "It was well run, but it wasn't really able to 
compete in the world market of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
To become the kind of manufacturing plant Goodwin and Sneller envision, 
management now will focus on "five basic things," Goodwin said: 
</P>
<P>
"The keys are employee involvement, total quality control, simplicity in design 
and manufacturing processes, total preventive maintenance -- fix it before it 
breaks down -- and just-in-time inventory control" that promotes rapid 
inventory turnover to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
"By doing this, we increase profits, increase competitiveness and satisfy 
customer demands better than our competition, which is what American 
manufacturing should be doing," Goodwin said.

FLUOR AWARDED 2 CONTRACTS WORTH $250 MILLION

Citing a resurgence in the petroleum and mining industries, Fluor Corp. said 
Tuesday that it has won two contracts with a combined value of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based engineering and construction giant said its Fluor Daniel 
subsidiary was awarded a $200-million contract to convert a Corpus Christi, 
Tex., oil refinery operated by San Antonio-based Valero Refining Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said that it has won a $50-million contract to engineer and 
help build a copper and molybdenum-processing plant 200 miles north of 
Santiago, Chile. The contract is with Los Pelambres Copper, a Chilean company. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the contract announcements, Fluor's stock continued its roller-coaster 
performance in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Its stock closed at 
$36.50, down 25 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor stock fell sharply in recent weeks as investors grew jittery that the 
Middle East crisis would jeopardize the company's extensive business in that 
region. The stock fell from about $45 to close at $31.50 last week before 
staging a mild recovery.

With the Valero Refining contract, Fluor will help the unit of Valero Energy 
Co. upgrade the refinery to produce low-emission gasoline that can meet tougher 
government air-pollution standards. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bernhart, a vice president of Fluor Daniel, the company's chief 
operating unit, said the Valero contract is one of several similar projects 
that Fluor is working on for oil refiners across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Benefiting from petroleum price hikes that began even before the current Middle 
East crisis, the U.S oil industry has been recovering from the disastrous slump 
that struck when prices plummeted in the 1980s. That has prompted oil companies 
to invest in building and upgrading their refineries, Bernhart said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Pelambres contract is the sixth that Fluor has received from Chilean 
copper producers in the last two years. In 1988, Fluor received a $300-million 
contract from BHP Utah International to build support facilities for a Northern 
Chile mine. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor's strong presence in Chile puts it in a good position to capture new 
business in that country, Bernhart said, as world demand for copper grows and 
competing copper-mining operations in Peru face disruptions from political and 
labor unrest.

LA PALMA MAN SAYS HE'S WON CHIP PATENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After battling for nearly 20 years for the recognition he believed due him, a 
La Palma engineer said late Tuesday he has been awarded a U.S. patent for his 
1968 invention of the computer on a chip. 
</P>
<P>
The startling announcement is sure to have broad ramifications throughout the 
worldwide semiconductor industry, analysts said, because virtually every chip 
manufacturer today makes products potentially covered by the patent quietly 
issued last month by the U.S. Patent Office. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts cautioned that if Gilbert Hyatt, a 52-year-old self-employed 
consulting engineer, attempts to strictly enforce the patent with claims for 
large royalty payments, he probably will face the well-funded legal apparatus 
of every semiconductor maker in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Products containing chips apparently covered by the new patent range from 
electronic dishwashers to automobiles to telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"These devices are in virtually every piece of electronic gear on the planet," 
said Michael Slater, editor of a microprocessor newsletter in the San Francisco 
area. "There are literally millions of them around." 
</P>
<P>
Slater said the patent covers what is known in the industry as 
"microcontrollers" or "single chip microcomputers," devices that contain 
electronic brains as well as electronic memory systems. The devices, Slater 
noted, are not the same as microprocessors, which power personal computers and 
for which other patents have already been issued to scientists at Intel and 
Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt, a soft-spoken engineer who had sought the patent since 1970 for an 
electronic machine tool controller he built in 1968, said Tuesday night that he 
is not interested in large royalty payments from semiconductor companies. "I'm 
not an enforcer, I'm a research engineer," Hyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hyatt said that he intends to pursue licensing agreements with 
companies that he believes are using his invention and that he is already in 
such discussions with one semiconductor company he declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said he pursued the patent for 20 years despite two rejections from the 
patent office. He said he kept refiling the patent application because he 
believed that he had made an important contribution that needed to be 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt, who is working on advanced technology projects in his La Palma 
laboratory, said he has no illusions about getting rich from the patent. "I 
would just like to fund my research work," he said.

U.S. ACTS TO FORBID FEEDING OF DOLPHINS

<P>
Citing hazards posed by "dolphin feeding" cruises, the government moved to ban 
all public feeding of wild dolphins, seals and other marine mammals in U.S. 
coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
The public has 45 days to comment on the rule, which probably will take effect 
Jan. 1, National Marine Fisheries Service officials said. The officials worry 
that the feedings will disrupt natural eating habits. The fisheries staff found 
that heavily fed dolphins tended to congregate around any boat, increasing the 
risk of injury or capture. It fears that the easy food source could make 
dolphins reluctant to migrate normally.

An abandoned campfire sparked a ferocious wind-whipped wildfire in Utah's 
Wasatch County that has killed two firefighters, gutted 18 homes and blackened 
3,000 acres, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been identified, but authorities said anyone responsible could 
be forced to pay the entire cost of suppressing the fire. Slightly cooler 
temperatures, with highs from 80 to 85 degrees, and reduced winds have helped 
firefighters gain the upper hand. Officials said they were optimistic they 
would control the fire later today.

CANCER PATIENT WHO LIVES IN RV CAN STAY, CITY SAYS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Fisher, the 41-year-old cancer patient who was told she could no longer 
live in a recreation vehicle parked in her cousin's driveway, has been granted 
a reprieve by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
A permit issued by the city's planning department allows Fisher to continue 
living in the RV in the Alto Capistrano area for three months. The city earlier 
had ordered her to leave by last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to granting the extension, Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said Tuesday 
that the city may consider a request from Fisher's cousin for an extension when 
the Nov. 27 deadline expires. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said she was pleased by the community's support. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try not to worry," Fisher said. "I'm hanging on, and I'm not 
dying like I'm supposed to. But I hope I don't have to go through all of this 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said he had discussed the issue with the City Council and staff 
members, adding that they plan to act "as sensitively as possible" in dealing 
with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Fisher) can only be accommodated where she is (in the driveway), I'll do 
everything I can to accommodate her wishes," Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher has been battling ovarian cancer for 10 years. The house on Calle 
Borrego where her RV has been parked since March is occupied by her cousin, 
Jean Maxey, a retired nurse who has cared for Fisher for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher can move into an extra bedroom in the house, but she said she would 
prefer to live in the RV because it allows her to maneuver and perform her 
daily tasks. Fisher, who is attached to an IV pump almost 24 hours a day, 
recently underwent an ileostomy -- surgery to create an artificial opening in 
the stomach so intestinal contents can be discharged in a plastic bag -- and 
has lost 140 pounds in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The city had asked Fisher to move her RV out of the neighborhood by Aug. 27 
after two neighbors complained that the vehicle is an eyesore that could lower 
the value of their $400,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
After a newspaper article highlighted the amputee's plight, several San Juan 
Capistrano residents rallied to get the city to issue a special permit for 
Fisher to remain in the driveway. Caren Chatham-Heller, a Mission Springs 
resident and community activist, founded a group called Friends of Linda Fisher 
and began a petition drive Tuesday to get the city to grant permission for her 
stay where she is. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said he received two to three dozen letters and telephone calls, 
including one from the office of Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), asking the city 
to help the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a neighborhood problem, and I encourage the neighbors to be 
supportive and sensitive," Hausdorfer said. "I hope through all this that Ms. 
Fisher is not inconvenienced or caused discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
When told about the temporary permit granted by the city on Monday, the 
neighbor who filed the initial complaint against Fisher said he would contest 
the matter in court "if I had the money." He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hausdorfer and several San Juan Capistrano residents said they 
would fight for Fisher's RV to remain in the driveway, Maxey said she was 
making plans to move the RV to the side of the house and out of the neighbors' 
sight. In fact, the temporary permit was granted on the condition that Maxey 
move the vehicle to the side of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Maxey said Tuesday that she had already submitted plans to the city to have a 
retaining wall moved so that the RV can have easier access to the side. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda is extremely vulnerable out there" in the driveway, Maxey said. "It 
affects her when people drive by and point and talk about the whole issue. It's 
a lot of psychological pressure. Moving her to the side of the house will give 
her peace of mind."

FIRM ACCUSED IN CHEMICAL DUMPING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PAINT COMPANY HID HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THE GARBAGE FOR 2 1/2 YEARS, 
D.A. SAYS. IT'S CALLED ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES EVER 
UNCOVERED BY THE COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
An Anaheim paint manufacturing plant and its top executive were charged Tuesday 
with five felony counts for allegedly hiding several hundred thousand gallons 
of hazardous chemicals in sawdust and secretly dumping it in the garbage for at 
least 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
W.C. Richards Co. saved several thousand dollars per week by disguising the 
solvents and hauling them illegally to the county-run Brea-Olinda landfill, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald Johnston, an environmental-protection prosecutor 
in the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials termed it one of the most premeditated and large-scale 
cases they have seen in Orange County, and said the dumping endangers public 
health because county dumps cannot safely handle chemicals. The carcinogenic 
liquids can slowly leak into the ground water and release toxic fumes into the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most serious environmental crimes we've had in Orange 
County," Johnston said. "It's serious because they dumped a tremendous volume 
of the stuff, and we have found these chemicals in the ground water 
(underneath) the landfill. We can't say for sure it came from the dumping by 
W.C. Richards, but it was the same chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney charged W.C. Richards Co., 1116 N. Olive St., and Marion 
Bruce Hale, 44, of Brea, with five counts of unlawful disposal of hazardous 
waste. Hale, a vice president of the Illinois-based paint company, is in charge 
of the Anaheim manufacturing facility, 
</P>
<P>
W.C. Richards employees told authorities that disguising and dumping the 
chemicals was a common practice for five years, Johnston said, but the statute 
of limitations restricts the case to crimes allegedly committed in the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant on the criminal charges was issued Tuesday for Hale, who, 
along with the corporation, could face fines up to $100,000 per day of 
violation for 2 1/2 years, or about $90 million. Hale also could be sentenced 
to serve up to six years in state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"His attorney says he will turn himself in tomorrow," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Hale's attorney, John Burns of Los Angeles, said Tuesday that he could not 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen the complaint yet. All I can say is we're taking this matter 
very seriously. We're working it out with the D.A. now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for W.C. Richards Co., a paint manufacturer with headquarters in 
Chicago, did not return telephone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said Hale directed his employees on a daily basis to mix unusable 
sludge and solvents with sawdust, then cover it with ordinary garbage in trash 
bins that were hauled by garbage trucks to the Brea-Olinda landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Employees told officials that they illegally disposed of 150 to 300 gallons of 
solvents per day, Johnston said. For years, the plant had told the Anaheim Fire 
Department it was recycling all its chemicals, fire officials said in April. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the county's environmental strike team, acting on an anonymous phone 
tip, diverted the company's garbage for four days. They said they found 
hazardous concentrations of metals, methyl ethyl ketone, trichloroethane, 
ethylbenzene, xylene and toluene, all highly toxic solvents that are suspected 
carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five felony charges stem from the waste sampled and other evidence 
collected in that undercover investigation. The fifth charges unlawful disposal 
daily for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What they were dumping were sludges and highly contaminated solvents, with 
lots of metals, such as zinc and lead," Johnston said. "There were all kinds of 
exotic solvents." 
</P>
<P>
The company was raided April 17 by the strike team, which is coordinated by the 
district attorney's office and is composed of members of about 10 city, county 
and regional agencies. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires the chemicals to be disposed of in special toxic-waste 
plants or landfills, most of which are several hundred miles from Orange 
County. The cost of legal disposal of solvent waste is about $500 per 55-gallon 
drum. In contrast, it costs mere pennies to dump a drum in a county landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bowerman, director of Orange County's Integrated Waste Management 
Department, said there are probably other companies that disguise their toxic 
waste and dump it in the landfills, "but I don't think there's a huge number of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
He said household chemicals, such as bleach and paint, are also dumped 
illegally in the trash. The county this year opened a collection center in 
Anaheim that is the first of several free household toxics roundup sites in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Small businesses are struggling because they are prohibited from using the 
centers and they have trouble paying disposal costs that larger companies can 
more easily afford. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably a few hundred companies in Orange County that are rocking 
along earning some kind of living, and they can't really afford the costs of 
legal disposal. The county should help them," Bowerman said. "But that doesn't 
excuse what this paint company did. They were doing things knowingly in 
violation of the law."

LAX PARKING FEES TO INCREASE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: ACTION FOLLOWS IMPOSITION OF A 10% TAX ON SPACES CITYWIDE. CHARGES 
WILL RISE AN EVEN $1 SO LOT ATTENDANTS DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE. 
</P>

<P>
The price of parking at Los Angeles International Airport will rise this 
weekend, the second large increase in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said Tuesday they had no choice but to raise parking rates 
after the Los Angeles City Council imposed a 10% citywide parking tax to combat 
city budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that simply adding the tax to current parking charges would force 
attendants to make change and lead to longer delays at exit booths, officials 
decided to use the opportunity to raise rates even further. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Saturday, it will cost an additional $1 a day to park at garages in 
the central terminal area and at remote lots. Charges for the first hour of 
parking opposite the terminals will also increase by $1. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Miller, deputy executive director of the Department of Airports, said 
"it would be a disaster" if the airport had tacked on the 10% parking tax to a 
motorist's bill and attendants had to make change for odd amounts. "We wanted 
to avoid it at all cost." 
</P>
<P>
The result -- the $1 increase -- is expected to add $1.3 million to the airport 
beyond the $5.4 million in parking taxes that will go to the city's treasury. 
"We tried to set the rates so the impact would be zero, but there was just no 
way to do it," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the approximately 25,000 parking spaces at LAX are expected to 
raise just under $59 million annually beginning Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rates in the central terminal area will rise from $15 to $16 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The steepest increase will be for those who park for an hour or less. The 
current rate is $2 for the first hour and $1 per hour after that, up to the 
daily $15 maximum. The new minimum charge will be $3, which covers the first 
two hours of parking, and $1 an hour after that, up to the new maximum of $16 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
Parking meters in the terminal area will remain 25 cents for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The daily charge in remote Lot B, at 111th Street between Aviation and La 
Cienega boulevards, will rise to $5. In remote Lot C, at 96th Street and 
Sepulveda Boulevard, the daily rate -- which was $4 before last December's 
increase -- will rise to $7. Parking will continue to be free for the first two 
hours at remote lots. 
</P>
<P>
The chief beneficiaries of the previous increase in parking revenues were the 
airlines that serve the airport. Through a complex agreement that has existed 
since the late 1940s, every time airport revenues exceed expenses and debt 
service by a set amount, landing fees drop. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the airport's raising of both short-term and long-term parking 
rates last December, the first such increases in seven years, meant a 
$12-million savings for the airlines this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, all things being equal, every $1 of increased revenue lowers the 
landing fees by a corresponding $1," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of higher expenses and a recent decision to eliminate rental charges 
for luggage carts, this weekend's increase in parking rates in not likely to 
mean a further reduction in landing fees, Miller said.

LAX PARKING RATE INCREASES 
</P>
<P>
 The second parking rate hike in nine months takes effect Saturday at Los 
Angeles International Airport. The figures reflect a 10% parking tax imposed 
because of city budget problems.

SUIT DELAYS PLAN FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long-awaited plans to rejuvenate the Anaheim Plaza mall and the area 
surrounding it have been delayed because two Anaheim residents have sued the 
city, arguing that its redevelopment plan does not provide enough low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Torres and Maria Lara, both members of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional an 
immigrants rights group in Anaheim and Santa Ana, charge in a suit filed two 
weeks ago that the city redevelopment plan is flawed. The suit claims the 
city's housing plan was not up to date at the time the redevelopment proposal 
was approved, as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also challenges the city's position that the area is predominantly 
"blighted," which must be established before a redevelopment project area can 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Through the lawsuit, Torres and Lara hope to win more money for low-income 
housing than what is now planned for the area. State law requires that a 
minimum of 20% of tax money collected in a redevelopment area be used for 
low-income housing. The money can be used for either constructing the housing, 
or paying for related uses such as road or street lighting improvements that 
would ensure such housing would be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We can use some of the money to build housing for the low-income people," said 
Torres. "They're paying taxes, they deserve better homes." 
</P>
<P>
The women are represented by Jonathan Lehrer-Graiwer, a Los Angeles-based 
attorney known for challenging redevelopment agencies and other civic entities 
to ensure taxes collected for low-income homes are used for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
City officials were upset by the suit, which was filed within hours of the 
60-day appeal deadline. The project has been in the works for 18 months and has 
been met with considerable support by merchants and residents in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing that the attorney first resorted to the court system to 
discuss the concerns of his clients given the exhaustive opportunities over the 
last year and a half for . . . all interested individuals to discuss questions 
and concerns with the agency and staff," said City Manager James Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
The city has held numerous public hearings on the plan to redevelop the 
350-acre area. Dozens of residents attended those hearings, culminating in an 
celebration with nearly 100 residents the night the plan was passed by the City 
Council. LISA MASCARO

5-CENT ALCOHOL TAX ENDORSED BY COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously endorsed the November ballot's 
"nickle-a-drink" initiative, which would raise taxes on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In a summary to other council members, Mayor Lida Lenney urged support for the 
initiative, noting that Laguna Beach police spend "a great deal" of time 
dealing with drunk drivers and family disputes fueled by alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would impose a surtax of 5 cents per 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces 
of wine and 1 ounce of distilled spirits. Money raised would be used for a 
variety of social services, including drug and alcohol abuse programs, domestic 
violence and child abuse prevention training and emergency medical care.LESLIE

COUNCIL APPROVES TRASH CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Refusing to bow to the will of an overflow crowd, the City Council voted this 
week to award an exclusive contract for residential trash removal to Waste 
Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Notified of the meeting by a citywide mailer sent last week by representatives 
of Western Waste Inc., a competing trash hauler, the large crowd mainly 
supported sending out the garbage removal contract for competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
With standing room only in the council chambers and residents crowded into the 
corridors and interior offices of City Hall, the council voted, 3 to 2, to 
approve a contract with Waste Management Inc. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year contract will raise garbage collection rates from $8.73 to $11.85 
per household -- the highest among Orange County cities. However, the pact will 
add several new services, including hazardous household waste pickup, a 20% 
discount for senior citizens and a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pressure from the audience, the council held firm to its July 9 
decision to deal only with Waste Management Inc., which has held the contract 
in the community for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's all over," Councilman William S. Craycraft said. "It's tiring 
when issue after issue in this city is like Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers, including Susan Withrow and Ray Carolin, who are council 
candidates in the November municipal elections, criticized the exclusive 
contract, saying the city would get a better rate by allowing competitive 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
But other residents supported dealing exclusively with Waste Management, saying 
the firm has served the city well. FRANK MESSINA

SUSPECT IN MURDERS FACED EARLIER CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING THREE FORMER CO-WORKERS IN TUSTIN HAD BEEN 
ACCUSED EARLIER OF CRIMES IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man accused of murdering three former co-workers in Tustin has been wanted 
by Southland police for more than a year for allegedly punching a motorist in 
Riverside County, as well as stealing vehicles and fleeing from authorities in 
San Bernardino County, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that if we'd put more effort into catching this guy in the 
first place," said Don Unkenholz of Corona, whose trailer was allegedly stolen 
by Greg Sturm in late 1989, "then three young men might be alive today." 
</P>
<P>
Sturm, 20, was arrested last week in connection with the Aug. 19 
execution-style murders of three workers at a Super Shops automotive parts 
store in Tustin. Authorities allege Sturm killed the young men while robbing 
the store to support his drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew a year ago that this Greg Sturm had problems," Unkenholz asserted. 
"There were warning signs, but we ignored them." 
</P>
<P>
But Southland authorities countered that the handling of Sturm's case is only a 
reflection of a judicial system that has been slowed by gridlocked courts and 
overcrowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always speculate in hindsight," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lew Rosenblum, who will prosecute Sturm when he reappears in court Sept. 7 to 
face charges of murder, robbery and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, there are thousands and thousands of arrest warrants out 
throughout the state, and you have to work the biggest ones. It's a question of 
priorities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Vic Stull, whose office brought 
misdemeanor theft charges against Sturm in 1989: "We just don't have the 
resources to track all these people down. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, misdemeanors are not actively sought. If we get a tip and we know 
exactly where the person is, we can go get him. But otherwise, we've had 
warrants go for years, literally. With a guy like this, with what we had before 
us, he did not appear then to be a homicidal risk, so we couldn't spare the 
time and people to track him down." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, a warrant was put out for Sturm's arrest in Riverside County 
after he allegedly fled the scene of a roadside confrontation. He was charged 
with assault and battery for allegedly punching another motorist in the face 
during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant for Sturm's arrest was issued again in October, 1989 -- this time, in 
San Bernardino County after he failed to show up in court on charges of 
receiving stolen property and evading arrest. Arrested with two juveniles, he 
had allegedly stolen trailers with off-road vehicles on them, then fled when 
approached by a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor charges were lodged against him in both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, he faces the gas chamber if a jury finds that he bound three 
former co-workers at the Super Shops store, shot each of them in the head at 
close range and took $1,100 from the store. 
</P>
<P>
Described by employers and neighbors as hot-headed and combative, Sturm had 
been fired from the store just a few weeks before the murders and returned to 
the scene of the crime the day after with a friend.

LATINOS ACCUSE D.A. OF GOP POLITICS IN PROBE OF SECURITY GUARDS AT POLLS; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: CAPIZZI DENIES CHARGES AND SAYS U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE REVIEWING 
FINDINGS IN '88 INCIDENT TO DETERMINE IF CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED.

<P>
A group of Latino community leaders angrily charged Tuesday that Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi is playing politics with his department's criminal 
investigations by not resolving a civil rights case involving Republican 
officials who support his election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, 17 Latino representatives complained that it has been 
nearly two years since county and federal authorities began investigating 
whether Republican Party officials working with Garden Grove Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle's campaign violated civil rights laws by hiring uniformed security 
guards at polling places on Election Day in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
They pledged to keep public pressure on the issue by forming a new organization 
called Americans for Constitutional Justice that will organize pickets at 
political events -- especially Capizzi's -- beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that the district attorney is prejudiced, biased and is 
either conspiring to protect those responsible for hiring, instructing and 
posting the uniformed security guards or is incompetent," said Rueben Martinez, 
a Democratic activist and leader of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders charged that some Latino voters were intimidated by the guards 
and did not vote. Republican officials involved in the decision -- including 
members of the county GOP Central Committee and Pringle's campaign -- say the 
guards were hired in response to rumors that illegal voters were being bused in 
by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"First there was the conspiracy by some county Republicans to deny Hispanics 
the right to vote," Martinez said. "Is there now a second, even more serious 
miscarriage of justice by the district attorney preventing a proper criminal 
investigation?" 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said Tuesday that the investigation is substantially complete and the 
findings are being reviewed by federal authorities in Washington to determine 
if charges should be filed. He also said that to avoid the appearance of a 
conflict of interest, he turned over the authority for the case to Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Wallace J. Wade last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I can speak from my perspective that politics are not involved," Capizzi said. 
"It sounds like maybe from their perspective, the answer would be different." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, a Republican who is facing a run-off election for the district 
attorney's post after being appointed to the seat last January by the Orange 
County supervisors, also said he did not believe that it was improper for his 
office to conduct the investigation while he is seeking election. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney's office is a nonpartisan office, so I don't think 
there's any conflict at all," he said. "There is no legal basis for my 
non-participation." 
</P>
<P>
Wade said his office gave its findings from the investigation to federal 
authorities before June. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're considering a couple of things that I'm not at liberty to 
discuss, but how it's going to come down in the final analysis, I don't know," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors in Santa Ana declined to comment on the case and others in 
Washington were unavailable Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Americans for Constitutional Justice is a bipartisan 
organization, and one woman attending the press conference identified herself 
as a registered Republican. Several members, however, are Democratic activists 
including Martinez and Evelyn Colon Becktell, who is running against state Sen. 
Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the group is not affiliated with Capizzi's opponent in the 
November election -- Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James Enright -- or with 
Pringle's Democratic opponent, Tom Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the organization has renewed a request made last fall to state 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to intervene in the investigation because of a 
conflict of interest in the district attorney's office. The group is also 
asking for inquiries into the length of the investigation by the Orange County 
Grand Jury and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. James Bates (D-San Diego) has already asked that Congress conduct an 
inquiry into why the investigation has taken so long. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been cheated; we have been lied to; we have been denied our dignity as 
American citizens; we have been treated without respect; we have been made 
fools long enough," Martinez said.

IRATE ROTH FORCES COUNTY REWRITE OF REPORT OPPOSING DESERT JAIL SITE;

<P>
STUDY: THE SUPERVISOR FIRMLY DISPUTES CONTENTION BY ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF THAT

Supervisor Don R. Roth, expressing his deep disappointment in a county 
administrative office report that snubbed a desert jail proposal he strongly 
supports, led his colleagues Tuesday in sending the report back for more work. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly expected much more from the county report," Roth said during a board 
session dominated by discussion of the controversial document. "I'm not sure 
what damage this report has done. . . . I just hope we can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Roth has questioned many aspects of the report, which staff members wrote after 
conducting a detailed, 10-month study of the desert jail proposal. The report 
concluded that utility and transportation costs at the proposed desert facility 
would make its operation so expensive that it should be dropped from any 
further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion infuriated Roth, who has focused much of his criticism on the 
report's estimates of land values in Gypsum Canyon, east of Anaheim, and 
Chiriaco Summit, in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a local consulting firm that reviewed the staff report over the 
weekend, Roth, a former Anaheim mayor, has argued that buying land in Gypsum 
Canyon would be far more expensive than the report indicates; similarly, he 
said the price of land in Chiriaco Summit is much cheaper than the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fully expecting a feasibility study, but what the staff returned with is 
flawed," Roth said, adding that Gypsum Canyon site costs were "unrealistically 
low, and I put that lightly." 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider told supervisors in a memo last 
week that Chiriaco Summit land prices were taken from data supplied by the 
First Boston Corp. The value for land in Gypsum Canyon came from a 1989 county 
study, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster his case that the Chiriaco Summit land was overpriced in the county 
staff estimates, Roth brought with him to Tuesday's session Margit Rusche, a 
lifelong Chiriaco resident who offered to sell her 800 acres in the area to 
Orange County for less than $2,000 an acre. The staff report had estimated land 
values in the desert at about $7,200 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," Rusche said following the board meeting. "Nobody's getting 
that kind of money for land out there. There's nothing on that land but the 
snakes and the lizards." 
</P>
<P>
Roth requested that the county administrative office review the criticisms of 
its work and report back to the board within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors approved that request, and Schneider said he believed the work 
could be completed within that time. 
</P>
<P>
Even supervisors who have supported construction of a jail in Gypsum Canyon 
backed Roth's request. Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, for instance, urged 
Schneider to return with a broader set of estimates than are provided in the 
original document. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you ought to give us a couple of different scenarios in terms of a 
high-end and a low-end cost," Stanton said. "I think you ought to look at those 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton and two other supervisors, Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder, have 
voted to proceed with Gypsum Canyon as the site for the county's next jail. But 
four votes are needed to condemn land, and both Roth and Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez, whose district includes the Gypsum Canyon site, say they will not vote 
to do that.

CITY, COUNTY CRITICIZED FOR HOMELESS SWEEPS

Social service advocates lashed out at city and county government Tuesday, 
contending that neither has done enough to help the homeless, the target of 
recent police sweeps at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless are considered the new lepers of society," said Jean Forbath, 
chairwoman of the county's Human Relations Commission. "We can't push these 
people to one place and expect them to disappear. There is no island out there 
where we can put them." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Tuesday, Forbath and other advocates said local government 
must provide more drug rehabilitation programs, develop single-room occupancy 
hotels and financial assistance for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stay at the Civic Center have been homeless the longest, said Allison 
Armstrong, chairwoman of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Many of 
them have drug addictions or are mentally ill but have no place to seek help, 
Armstrong added. 
</P>
<P>
"Solutions exist," she said. "It's not like we have to reinvent something here. 
We need to be less patient with our leaders." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Homeless Issues Task Force, there are 18 shelters in the 
county with 600 shelter beds; 21 of them are detoxification beds for indigent 
alcoholics. Orange County has an estimated 10,000 homeless people, almost half 
of whom are children under the age of 18, the task force says. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath said the recent Santa Ana police sweeps across the Civic Center grounds 
will not make the homeless go away. 
</P>
<P>
"We can chase the homeless from Costa Mesa, Laguna and Newport Beach, make them 
uncomfortable in Anaheim and Orange and Garden Grove and banish them from Santa 
Ana. But the question remains, where will they go?" Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 15, Santa Ana police cited 64 homeless people for minor violations such 
as littering and urinating in public. The following week, police arrested 26 in 
sweeps that Police Chief Paul M. Walters said were not aimed at harassing the 
homeless but, rather, reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said police were called to the 
Civic Center Tuesday to break up a rock- and bottle-throwing incident. She said 
30 to 40 homeless were involved. Eleven were arrested.

BUSH GIVES U.S. TROOPS A PEP TALK

The U.S. ambassador to Jordan waited at the Iraqi border today to see if Saddam 
Hussein would make good on his promise to release Western women and children 
held in Iraq. The White House said it had no evidence that they were free to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's ambassador to the United States today formally notified the State 
Department of the plan to let the group go. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat told reporters after meeting with department 
officials that the Americans will be allowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey 
but gave no timetable for their departure. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible administratively that everybody go on the same day," 
Al-Mashat said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know whether the Iraqi government would provide aircraft to 
facilitate the departures. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Mashat said once the United States gives assurances "that they are not going 
to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq or aggress upon Iraq, then we are going to let 
even men out." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush today delivered a pep talk to U.S. troops broadcast over Armed 
Forces Radio. He said their assignment in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the 
gulf is "one of the toughest military missions in modern memory." 
</P>
<P>
"You stand on the front line against aggression and international lawlessness," 
Bush said. "We have never sought conflict, nor do we hope to chart a course for 
other nations, but at the hands of injustice, in the face of aggression, ours 
is a once-reluctant fist now clutched resolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the region apparently did not hear Bush's address because the radio 
network does not have a transmitter in Saudi Arabia. The only place it could be 
received there is at permanent U.S. barracks on Saudi military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, the Iraqi president, announced Tuesday that all women and children 
among the thousands of foreigners being held hostage could leave starting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
However, no Western hostages had crossed the Jordanian border by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Roger Harrison traveled to the Jordanian border post of Ruweishid, 
210 miles northeast of Amman, to supervise the reception of any American women 
and children arriving there, the embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
American diplomatic officials have manned the border round-the-clock for two 
weeks in case any U.S. hostages were freed. Harrison's presence suggested new 
arrivals were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, meanwhile, refused to confirm or deny a 
report that the Administration had received a message from the Iraqi president, 
offering to pull out his invading troops from Kuwait with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But in Amman senior Arab military officials said today that Hussein is expected 
to declare federated self-rule for Kuwait in a bid to ease the gulf crisis and 
allow the United States to withdraw in partial victory. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, already floated to the Soviet Union and the United States, the 
sources said, may figure in talks Thursday between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik 
Aziz and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Hussein is likely to announce the move before the end of 
September.

An elderly Laguna Hills couple and an Irvine woman were killed Tuesday night in 
a three-car collision that also left a 32-year-old man with minor injuries and 
forced closure of Irvine Center Drive until late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
John Feltman, 75, and his wife, Celia, 73, were traveling along a rural stretch 
of the road from their Leisure World home when the car in which they were 
riding drifted into oncoming traffic, Irvine Police Lt. Bob Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Their 1988 Mercury Marquis smashed headlong into a 1987 Chevrolet Camaro driven 
by Beth A. Ward, 26, who was traveling eastbound along Irvine Center Drive near 
Valencia Avenue, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquis then flipped over and struck a 1986 Ford Bronco II that was being 
driven by Jeffrey Snyder, a computer programmer. 
</P>
<P>
The Feltmans and Ward were pronounced dead at the scene, Leonard said. Snyder 
was taken to nearby Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated 
for a bruised knee and a strained neck and later released, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said investigators were trying to determine why Feltman was driving on 
the wrong side of the road.

Armenia's Parliament declared a state of emergency today and banned the largest

up to six people, including a parliamentary deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament voted 170 to 0 with two abstentions to outlaw the Armenian National 
Army. It ordered ANA militants to give up their arms by 10 p.m. and abandon 
their heavily fortified headquarters in the republic's capital, Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
If the deadline is not met, officials said, the republic's Interior Ministry 
and KGB security service troops will move against the group. But ANA militants 
vowed not to surrender their weapons and called for negotiations with 
parliamentary leaders.

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan today had a small cancerous tumor removed from 
just beneath her left nostril, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The basal-cell carcinoma was discovered during a routine dermatological 
examination at the Mayo Clinic and was removed by a plastic surgeon at St. 
Marys Hospital, said Mark Weinberg, spokesman for Nancy Reagan and former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Nancy Reagan's left breast 
and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was found. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans arrived at the Mayo Clinic on Monday for what Weinberg said were 
routine physical examinations as part of their annual checkups and were found 
in excellent health.

JAPAN DETAILS AID IN IRAQ CONFLICT;

Japan ended weeks of indecision today and announced an aid package for the 
multinational effort building up in the Persian Gulf to force Iraqi troops out 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who has been battling behind the scenes to win a 
consensus within his fractious government and ruling party, went on television 
to announce the measures. 
</P>
<P>
These included offering "considerable" financial assistance to three states -- 
Jordan, Turkey and Egypt -- whose economies have been worst hit by a blockade 
on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
He said Japan will immediately send about 100 doctors and nurses to the gulf, 
along with water supply equipment needed for foreign forces there. 
</P>
<P>
It will provide civilian planes and ships to take nonmilitary supplies to the 
region, where U.S.-led forces are imposing a strict embargo on Iraq, and help 
finance other states providing further transport. 
</P>
<P>
The only specific sum Kaifu cited was a $10-million grant to Jordan to help 
defray the cost of receiving thousands of refugees fleeing the crisis zone. 
</P>
<P>
Japan had been under heavy diplomatic pressure from Washington, which is 
bearing the main burden of resisting the Iraqi threat to the gulf oil fields, 
to make a major contribution to the multinational forces being rushed into the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which receives about 70% of its oil supplies from the Middle East, has 
hesitated over committing itself to joining its Western allies beyond an early 
agreement to back the embargo on Iraq and freeze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, arguing that Japan's U.S.-imposed anti-war constitution bars them 
from sending troops or military equipment outside the country, have sought ways 
of channeling funds or non-belligerent aid to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Their task has been complicated by the presence of more than 400 Japanese 
trapped in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Last weekend, Baghdad's culture and 
information minister warned Tokyo that the status of these civilians could be 
threatened if it backed the squeeze on Iraq.

MARINE APPEALS DEATH SENTENCE, ALLEGES RACISM

<P>
A military appeals court was asked today to overturn the death sentence of a 
Marine in a racially tinged case. Accused of killing his platoon commander and 
the commander's wife, he faces the first military execution in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Ronnie Curtis, who is black, contends racial taunts drove him to 
kill Lt. James Lotz and Lotz's wife, Joan, on April 13, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who confessed to a state trooper and to investigators, was sentenced to 
death after being convicted of the slayings in a military trial. He is being 
held at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
His case is seen by attorneys on both sides as a test of the military death 
penalty. Among the many intervenors is the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, which said his 1987 court-martial was tainted by racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
Three civilian judges of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals were asked by 
Curtis' attorneys during oral arguments today to overturn his sentence on the 
ground that the military death penalty mechanism is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis was sentenced by a nine-member military panel, even though all states 
with death penalties require 12-member sentencing juries in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
A military panel found Curtis, then 21, guilty of fatally stabbing Lotz, a 
Scranton, Pa., native who was his section officer at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Curtis 
also was found guilty of stabbing Lotz's wife and sexually abusing her as she 
lay dying in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Military attorneys appointed for Curtis said in appeal papers that Lotz 
antagonized Curtis by imitating what he believed were black mannerisms and by 
calling Curtis "Be-bop" and "Shoo-be-do." 
</P>
<P>
"The relation between Pvt. Curtis and Lt. Lotz took on a dynamic like that 
which existed between a slave and his master," the legal arm of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People said in an amicus brief.

Three black men were hacked to death at migrant worker hostels near 
Johannesburg in the latest round of violence between black factions that has 
left more than 500 dead, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were killed and their bodies set on fire in Tembisa, northeast of 
Johannesburg, and a third died in Katlehong, southeast of the city, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 518 black residents have been killed in the factional violence that 
began in black townships on Aug. 12, when Zulus loyal to the Inkatha movement 
began fighting with Xhosas and other black supporters of the African National 
Congress. Despite the latest reported killings, violence has eased since the 
initial days of the fighting, when dozens of people were killed daily.

Prosecutors filed seven perjury charges against Police Chief Mack Vines, 
reportedly for statements he made to a panel investigating a police officer's 
fatal shooting of an unarmed Mexican national. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas County Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
John Vance today announced the charges and said they will be reviewed by a 
grand jury next week. They are third-degree felonies, each carrying a maximum 
10-year prison term and fines of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from Vines' testimony before a panel reviewing the 1989 
dismissal of Officer Patrick LeMaire. 
</P>
<P>
The panel had confronted the chief with accusations that he tried to influence 
the testimony of an assistant chief regarding the speed of the internal 
investigation of LeMaire. 
</P>
<P>
Vines fired LeMaire 17 days after he killed Jose Hilario, an unarmed Mexican 
national, on June 27, 1989. The chief said LeMaire violated the department's 
policy by failing to take steps that would have avoided a confrontation.

Cuba, citing a nearly 2-million-ton shortfall in Soviet oil shipments and a 
surge in world oil prices due to the Persian Gulf crisis, today announced 
drastic nationwide fuel restrictions and energy-saving measures. 
</P>
<P>
In a package of cuts published by the official newspaper Granma, the Communist 
government halted the start-up of a new oil refinery built with Soviet aid and 
said it will stop production at one of the country's three operating nickel 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The measures were the harshest so far introduced to offset growing disruption 
to the island's economic lifeline from the Soviet Union, its main political 
ally and trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said the country is moving toward a "special period in time of peace" -- 
the government's term to describe a siege economy situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be prepared for this," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
It even called on Cuban farmers to increase the use of draft animals instead of 
vehicles to pull carts and plows. 
</P>
<P>
Daily distribution of diesel fuel and gasoline to state companies was be 
restricted immediately. Gasoline distributed to the state sector through 
coupons will be cut 50% for the rest of the year, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline supplies to private vehicles will be reduced 30% beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said industries, farms and the public must reduce electricity 
consumption as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
It called on each Cuban family to cut back its monthly electricity consumption 
by 10%. If this target is not achieved, the authorities will be forced to 
introduce one day each week in which electricity would be shut off at peak 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, families who exceeded set limits could have their electricity cut 
off for as long as 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said even more energy-saving measures may be necessary if oil shipments 
from the Soviet Union continue to fall behind because of economic problems 
there.

Higher gasoline prices hiked West Germany's inflation rate 0.5 percentage 
points to about 2.9% in August, the official statistics office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation levels in June and July were 2.4%. The average inflation rate for the 
first seven months of the year was 2%, the office said. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics office attributed the increase to higher gas prices caused by 
the continuing crisis in the Persian Gulf that followed the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2.

Up to 50,000 people who bought microwave ovens thinking they were new when they 
weren't can get refunds from Maytag Corp. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval to the Maytag offer 
but set an Oct. 19 hearing to allow any objections from the buyers of the Magic 
Chef ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Maytag's Anniston plant has repackaged or reconditioned ovens that 
customers had returned. The company then sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Maytag, parent company of Magic Chef, denied any liability 
but agreed to halt the practice and to offer refunds of $35 to people who 
bought the ovens, primarily through Wal-Mart stores. The refunds would be cash 
payments of $25 and a $10 certificate toward the purchase of a Magic Chef 
product.

The Bavaria brewery said today that Saudi Arabia has asked it to double its 
exports of non-alcoholic beer to the Middle Eastern nation to help quench the 
thirst of American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand is much too large for us at the moment," said Rien Coolen, a 
spokesman for the Bavaria brewery. 
</P>
<P>
Before the request, Bavaria was finding it difficult to meet the demands for 
non-alcoholic beer in Saudi Arabia. A strictly Islamic nation, Saudi Arabia 
bans the sale of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
To help meet the Saudi request, the brewery is increasing output and will ask 
employees to work overtime, Coolen said.

Jets Coach Bruce Coslet said he will start quarterback Tony Eason in Thursday 
night's preseason finale at Tampa Bay because "it's Tony's turn to start." 
</P>
<P>
It's approaching judgment day in the Jets' quarterback competition and there is 
reason to wonder if Coslet may turn to Eason as his regular-season starter. 
</P>
<P>
In the preseason Eason has shown the ability to move the team better than 
incumbent starter Ken O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 series, Eason has directed the team to two touchdowns and a field goal. 
In 11 series, O'Brien has moved the team to one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Eason has completed 31 of 51 passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns. O'Brien 
has completed 12 of 26 for 133 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Coslet will name his starter sometime after the Tampa Bay game and before the 
Jets' season-opener at Cincinnati.

Andre Ware is making the big bucks, but Rodney Peete appears to have the edge 
in the Detroit Lions quarterback battle and hopes that he'll be rewarded if he 
becomes the starter. 
</P>
<P>
Peete, a second-year pro out of Southern California, where he was runner-up in 
the Heisman Trophy balloting in 1988, was the Lions' sixth draft pick in 1989. 
He signed a two-year contract worth $250,000, then became the Lions' starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Ware, who won the Heisman Trophy last season at the University of Houston, was 
the Lions' No. 1 draft pick in 1990 and received a $2-million signing bonus to 
go along with a four-year contract worth $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this is where the fun starts. 
</P>
<P>
Ware wants Peete's starting job and Peete wants some of Ware's money. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NFL Players Assn., the average salary for a quarterback last 
season was $638,000. Peete might even settle for that, for now. 
</P>
<P>
"When I start the season," Peete said, "it would be a nice gesture on their 
part to come to me and say, 'Rodney, we realize you're underpaid and making 
much, much, much less than what the average starting quarterback in the league 
is making. So, we want to get something done.' " 
</P>
<P>
Peete realizes that when the contract was signed last year, the money he 
received was in accordance with his status as a sixth-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
But now he has led the Lions to a 3-0 preseason record. He wants to be 
rewarded, although he promised he won't walk out, no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that being a sixth-round pick, you're only going to get so much 
money," he said. "That's the way the system works and I'm just a victim of the 
system. But when it's my turn to be on the other end, hopefully it will work 
out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Ware, who ended his holdout Monday night, drew a large crowd for his 
first practice session. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's way behind," Lions Coach Wayne Fontes said. "He thinks this is 
the same offense he ran in college, but it's only similar. It's not the same. I 
would think right now he's got an uphill battle. It's unfortunate, but he'll 
have to sit a while." 
</P>
<P>
Fontes said Ware will have to show he is better than Peete if he wants the 
starting job. 
</P>
<P>
"The best player will play for the Detroit Lions, regardless of position and 
regardless of where they were drafted," Fontes said. "You can put that in big 
print." 
</P>
<P>
Fontes said Ware will see some action Friday night when the Lions play their 
fourth and final exhibition game at Cincinnati.

The Astrodome was full of surprises for Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, who didn't 
expect to hit 30 homers this season and didn't expect to reach the milestone in 
the spacious home of the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was in the fourth inning Tuesday night, hitting a solo home run 
over the left field fence and making history.

Sandberg became the first second baseman to hit 30 or more homers in 
consecutive seasons as he led the Cubs to a 5-2 victory over Houston.

"It's tough to hit home runs here," Sandberg said. "I was very fortunate to get 
one tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg hit 30 homers last season and didn't realize before the season that he 
could become the first second baseman to do it consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season, I knew nothing about it, but it's a nice accomplishment," 
he said. "I didn't expect to hit 30 again this year. Last year was a career 
high and I'm surprised to see it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg is glad he's reached the milestone homer. Now he can return to his 
normal style. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past couple of weeks, I've been swinging for the fences too much," 
Sandberg said. "Now I can just hit the way I normally hit and if the home runs 
happen, they happen." 
</P>
<P>
Houston starter Bill Gullickson (8-12) had pitched three hitless innings when 
Sandberg came to the plate to start the fourth. He hit an 0-2 pitch over the 
left field fence to set the record. It marked the ninth time a second baseman 
has hit at least 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
The others were: Dave Johnson, Atlanta, 1973, 42; Rogers Hornsby, 1922, 42 and 
1925, 39 with St. Louis and 1929, 39 with the Cubs; Joe Gordon, Cleveland, 
1948, 32 and with New York Yankees, 1940, 30; Bobby Grich, California, 1979, 
30, and Sandberg, 1989, 30. 
</P>
<P>
No one appreciates Sandberg more than Cubs Manager Don Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"How would you like to be a manager in the major leagues and have a guy who 
makes all the plays, hits .300 and gets 30 home runs?" Zimmer asked. "He's the 
best at his position in baseball."

JOAN LUNDEN MARKS 10 YEARS ON AN A.M. SHOW

<P>
With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden this week celebrates her 10th anniversary 
as co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America." This makes her somewhat 
extraordinary -- lasting in a job that is a people-eater. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the person who has 
the most tenure on the morning shows," she says, referring to those in the 
co-host and co-anchor business. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it was just yesterday that I was the new kid on the block." 
</P>
<P>
Her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition. Network morning show stars 
tend to be television's wandering tribe, often moving on because of their own 
decisions, management anxiety, or both. Within the last 12 months, six other 
such stars have left or found new homes, notably Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
But Lunden -- who is only the third female co-host "Good Morning America" has 
had since it began in November, 1975 -- has stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
Married to television producer Michael Krauss, she's even managed to have three 
children in her time on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new five-year contract 
with ABC, says she hasn't had any desire to leave "Good Morning America." But 
then, her life on the show has been relatively serene. 
</P>
<P>
And her show, unlike "Today" and the shows that represent CBS' many years of 
efforts to make ratings in the morning, hasn't had the public turmoil of the 
kind that last year made "Today" a daily two-hour soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than penetrating 
interviews, hasn't even had a good headline-making incident, like former "CBS 
This Morning's" Kathleen Sullivan's off-air jabs at CBS management that made 
their way into print last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Morning America" was in second place to "Today," until late last year, 
when the veteran NBC program went through its much-publicized debacle, with 
Deborah Norville replacing Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
As a result "Good Morning America" has been first for 33 consecutive weeks. But 
during its long stay in second, Lunden said, those on the show didn't get a lot 
of pressure from ABC brass, or those of Capital Cities, the network's new 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They really just said, 'Hey, go out there, enjoy it, be curious, and have a 
good time, " she said. "They said, 'If it works, the ratings will go up.' And 
they did."

HOLLYWOOD MAINTAINS SOLID BOX-OFFICE TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moviegoers have shelled out more than $3.3 billion so far this year at the 
nation's box offices, about 2% less than collected at the turnstiles by this 
time last year. 
</P>
<P>
The movie business, which usually begins to lag at this time of year, has kept 
up a solid pace in recent weeks, boosted by a quartet of films dealing with 
supernatural themes. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the pack is the summer's runaway hit, "Ghost," which has taken in 
$111.5 million in seven weeks. Also registering unexpectedly strong showings 
are the last three films to open in the No. 1 weekend spot -- "Darkman," 
"Exorcist III" and "Flatliners." 
</P>
<P>
The year-to-date box-office total reached $3.33 billion over the weekend, 
compared to $3.38 billion for the same period last year, when the success of 
"Batman" made for Hollywood's best summer ever. In 1988, the total had just 
passed $3 billion at the same point.

A recent Beach Boys benefit concert not only fell far short of its expectations 
to raise money for the hurricane-stricken Isle of Palms Fire Department, but 
firefighters say it almost put them in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Larry Britton said he initially had hoped the Sunday event would 
raise at least $50,000, now he's happy they didn't lose money. 
</P>
<P>
They'll probably make about $1,500, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the group had been able to perform on the beach, things might have been 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers blamed the poor turnout partly on Mayor Carmen Bunch, who refused to 
allow the Beach Boys to play in Isle of Palms, citing the traffic headaches the 
concert would cause. The concert was held about 20 miles inland, at Ladson. 
</P>
<P>
Bunch said Tuesday she wished she had never heard of the Beach Boys. She said 
the event was not worth all the turmoil, and believes islanders couldn't afford 
the tickets. "It was risky business to begin with," she said.

ALTOVISE DAVIS DENIES SHE IS IMPOVERISHED

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of Altovise Davis, wife of the late entertainer Sammy Davis 
Jr., has denied a report that her husband's debts have left her impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Davis died May 16 of throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The denials apparently stem from a supermarket tabloid's report that grief and 
impending poverty had driven Altovise Davis to attempt suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to document that Altovise is in fine shape emotionally and she is 
in fine shape financially," San Francisco attorney Vasilios Choulos told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Family representative Gary Frischer said she did not attend the press 
conference because "she's busy right now on a project in Los Angeles." Choulos 
said she is considering several "creative projects" on her life and her late 
husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Both men denied they were lending credence to the tabloid report by denying it. 
"He who protests sort of accuses himself? Nothing could be further from the 
truth," said Choulos. 
</P>
<P>
Choulos acknowledged that Sammy Davis' prolific career and legendary generosity 
created "all sorts of loose ends" financially, but he said the entertainer left 
about $6 million to $8 million in real estate, jewelry, rare books and guns, 
and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that he was quick to perform for others' benefit, Choulos said, 
"Sammy probably gave away more than he ever made. A lot of people made money on 
Sammy." 
</P>
<P>
The Davis will, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, listed $2 million in 
personal property and $2 million in real estate. The tabloid report quoted the 
$4 million total, then claimed that sum would be consumed by debts, mortgages, 
liens and bequests to friends.

'ROCKY HORROR' MAY BE FALL VIDEO

<TEXT>
<P>
The midnight cult classic "Rocky Horror Picture Show" may come out as a video 
for the first time this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 camp hit, starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, has 
so far grossed $150 million and it may be released in November by CBS-Fox Video 
if negotiations are successful. The film marks its 15th anniversary in October. 
</P>
<P>
But "Rocky Horror" producer Lou Adler is worried that a video release could 
damage the film's performance in midnight showings at theaters across the 
country, including several in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
In those late-night screenings, moviegoers wear costumes, throw rice at the 
screen during the film's wedding ceremony and act out the entire movie in their 
seats.

BRIGHAM YOUNG: SOFT-SPOKEN QUARTERBACK MAKES A NAME FOR HIMSELF DESPITE THE 
COUGARS' LACK OF TV EXPOSURE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mormons like to tell this one on themselves: 
</P>
<P>
"How do you recognize a Latter-day Saints church?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one with the satellite dish outside." 
</P>
<P>
Such equipment is necessary because the networks still haven't discovered the 
Brigham Young University Cougars, who a while ago made college football the 
second most popular religion in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of 102 games in the last decade and the national championship in 1984, 
BYU will get a national cable audience only once this season -- Sept. 8 against 
Miami on ESPN -- and will appear on a regional basis twice -- Sept. 22 against 
San Diego State on CBS and Sept. 29 against Oregon on ABC. Otherwise, tune in 
KBYU-TV, the campus station, if you've got a dish. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity, because in the year of the quarterback, BYU may have the best. 
</P>
<P>
Ty Detmer might even be the best in the history of BYU, and that is saying a 
mouthful because quarterbacks are to BYU what tailbacks were to USC. Since 
1975, a half-dozen Cougar passers have won All-American recognition. The honor 
roll: Gifford Nielsen, Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon, Steve Young, Robbie Bosco and 
Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco was Detmer's favorite. Detmer saw him play against Air Force in one of 
those rare Cougar games that was fed into San Antonio in 1985. An all-state 
selection in Texas as a junior that year, Detmer already was hoping to attend a 
university that stressed passing. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer was coached by his father, Sonny, who called BYU Coach LaVell Edwards 
that summer to tell him the family was taking a car trip west and would like to 
say hello. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Ty was a terrific athlete, but he must have weighed all of 150 pounds 
when he came into this office," Edwards said recently. "His Adam's apple was as 
big as his head and he looked like he was 14 years old. We had a nice talk, and 
then his dad said, 'If you want us, we're ready to give you a verbal commitment 
right now.' I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great quarterback tradition, but it isn't that easy to recruit here. 
John Elway and Jeff George wouldn't even give us a visit. Ty went back to San 
Antonio, played his senior year and never even visited another school." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Detmer looks 17 and resembles a lanky middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
He actually is 22 and, according to the BYU media guide, packs 175 pounds on a 
6-foot frame. However, his most vital statistics are the 4,560 passing yards, 
32 touchdown passes and 265 completions of his first full season as a starting 
college quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
He set 11 NCAA records and tied two. You may remember him from the Holiday Bowl 
in San Diego. The ball was stripped from him on the play that sealed the 50-39 
victory for Penn State, but the Cougars wouldn't have been in the same ballpark 
with the Nittany Lions if Detmer hadn't thrown for a bowl -- any bowl -- record 
576 yards. 
</P>
<P>
If he stays two more years at BYU and remains injury-free, he will shatter the 
school records for career yardage (9,536), completions (653) and touchdowns 
(84) set by McMahon from 1978 through '81. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Detmer ranks as the most popular of all the Cougar quarterbacks among 
the residents of this college town -- population 85,000, elevation 4,553 feet, 
45 miles south of Salt Lake City at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
During the July 4 parade, Detmer and his father rode up University Avenue in a 
red roadster. Two U.S. senators and various dairy princesses were in the 
procession, too, but only the Detmers spent most of their time shaking hands 
with admirers who had streamed onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
After the team picture was taken on media day, Detmer stayed on the practice 
field two hours to sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
But it was during the 70-31 rout of crosstown rival Utah last November that he 
unexpectedly got to meet one of his fans up close and personal. 
</P>
<P>
The star quarterback got an upset stomach during the action and asked to excuse 
himself. He ran to the dressing room, which was locked. Time was precious and 
the need pressing, so he located the nearest public restroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty, it's you, doggone!" a fan said as No. 14 left his stall in full uniform 
and strapped on his white-and-blue helmet. 
</P>
<P>
It's little wonder that Detmer loves Provo as much as it loves him. He is a 
hunter and fisherman who spent much of the summer catching trout in the Provo 
River. When he saw this year's schedule, he was delighted that the Cougars had 
a bye on the opening weekend of deer hunting season. And winter means skiing at 
nearby Alta or Snowbird. 
</P>
<P>
He is a devout Methodist whose lifestyle flourishes on a Mormon campus where 
tobacco, drugs, alcohol, caffeine and premarital sex are prohibited, and dress 
and grooming codes are enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be more focused on football at BYU than at other places," he said. 
"Besides, I never smoke, drank or took drugs at home, so there's nothing 
different about that here." 
</P>
<P>
His idea of a wild time is to leave crushed raw eggs on the apartment floor of 
a teammate or to place a hog's head on the pillow of another. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, many of what otherwise would have been free hours were spent 
talking to visiting sportswriters. Such is an obligation of a Heisman Trophy 
candidate. The push is on for a junior Cougar quarterback to win the Heisman 
for the second consecutive year. In 1989, it was Andre Ware of the University 
of Houston Cougars, who left school early and signed with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
In his Texas twang, Detmer politely answers all questions, addresses his 
interviewer as "sir," and says he would be honored to become the first BYU 
quarterback to win the Heisman, although a 12-0 season is his real goal. 
</P>
<P>
The closest any Cougar has come to the Heisman was Young's runner-up finish in 
1983. McMahon was third in 1981 and Bosco third in 1984 and '85. Detmer was 
ninth last season. 
</P>
<P>
The one constant has been Edwards, whose career winning percentage of .745 
ranks third among the nation's coaches. It surprises those unfamiliar with BYU 
that he is a former defensive coordinator who leaves the offense to others. He 
has had some notable quarterback coaches, including Ted Tollner, Mike Holmgren, 
Doug Scovill, Wally English, Dwayne Painter, Dewey Warren and now Norman Chow. 
</P>
<P>
An influence on Edwards' thinking when he became head coach in 1972 after 10 
years as an assistant was John Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked under John at Utah State and liked what he did there and at 
Stanford," Edwards said. "Stanford is a private school with a lot of recruiting 
limitations. So are we. He showed what you can do when you've got a quarterback 
like Jim Plunkett or Don Bunce." 
</P>
<P>
Here is how Edwards, who was born in Provo 59 years ago, sees the quarterbacks 
who have played for him: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nielsen: "He didn't have a tremendous arm, but had a great feel for the 
game. Not fast, but a good all-around athlete who had the hand-eye coordination 
of a two-handicap golfer. A thinking man's quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wilson: "You could take a picture of him and everything would be perfectly 
symmetrical. A tall, lanky guy who was very graceful and probably had the 
strongest arm of all our quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 -- McMahon: "The epitome of pugnaciousness. A street fighter. Smart, too. He 
took one look at a defense and knew everything about it. He was blunt and spoke 
out, but I never had any problems with him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Young: "One of the most exciting athletes you'll ever see. Talk about 
explosiveness. And what an athlete. He could have been a running back, a 
defensive back or a wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bosco: "He was like a coach on the field. And he is a coach here now, 
working with our quarterbacks. Good touch on the ball and tremendously 
accurate. Great at the last-minute drive and didn't throw many interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
It took only a week of freshmen practice for Edwards to see that Detmer would 
uphold the BYU tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards points to his head. "That's something all the quarterbacks have had in 
common," he said. "They're smart and poised and have leadership ability. You 
could tell with Ty, the way the players reacted to him at the very first. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of high school, he and McMahon were probably the most ready. You 
look at Ty and worry about him getting banged around, but he's strong in a wiry 
sort of way. He's never been hurt, knock on wood. He's taken some hard shots, 
but he's very resilient." 
</P>
<P>
And Detmer's 17.2-yard average per completion last year was an NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a high-percentage team," Edwards said. "When we're doing things right, 
we don't turn the ball over. We'll go deep on occasion, but we'll never be 
confused with, say, the Raiders. Ty knows when to throw the ball, which is as 
important as knowing where to throw it. Most quarterbacks tend to wait too 
long. Ty makes the right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer insists that he will not opt for the NFL draft early. Of course, Ware 
said the same thing after winning the Heisman and before being picked in the 
first round by the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here and promised the school that I would stay five years," said 
Detmer, who was redshirted as a freshman. "I intend to live up to that 
obligation and to get my degree." 
</P>
<P>
He is a wildlife management major and says he probably will follow his father 
into coaching -- that, of course, after a career in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the strongest arm and I'm not big, but that shouldn't stop me," 
he said. "Look at Joe Montana. He's not that big, either, and he doesn't have a 
shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays in Provo, Detmer assumes mythical proportions at Cougar Stadium, 
whose 65,000 seats already have been sold out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, BYU should win the Western Athletic Conference title and advance to 
the Holiday Bowl. Most of the offense that ranked second nationally in yardage 
and fourth in scoring average returns. 
</P>
<P>
Among Detmer's blockers is Mike Jenkins, a 6-foot-8, 380-pound tackle. He is 
playing second string. If Jenkins could only get down to 320, the coaches say, 
he probably would be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, the old defensive coordinator, is more worried about how the Cougars 
will perform on that side of the scrimmage line. "Most great teams have great 
defenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But look for the Cougars to be near the top of the national rankings if the 
Heisman Trophy race ends in a Ty.

RAYMOND ST. JACQUES; ACTOR WAS 60

<P>
Actor Raymond St. Jacques, known for his breakthrough roles in such movies as 
"Black Like Me" and "Glory" as well as the TV miniseries "Roots," has died of 
cancer. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jacques died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at 1:30 p.m. Monday, hospital 
spokeswoman Paula Correia said Tuesday. He had been under treatment for cancer 
of the lymph glands since entering the hospital on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jacques, who stood 6 feet, 3 inches tall, was what one reviewer called "an 
organ-voiced actor" when he starred as Othello in the John Anson Ford Theater 
production in 1976. He was fluent in French and Italian, and appeared 
nationally in theater performances of "The Man With the Golden Arm," "Romeo and 
Juliet," "Raisin in the Sun" and "Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
"Black Like Me" was his first movie, made with James Whitmore in 1964, and he 
had a small, striking role in Sidney Lumet's "The Pawnbroker" the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after he starred as a tough Harlem detective in "Cotton Comes to 
Harlem," he told an interviewer that minorities had become a much stronger 
presence in film: "There are ethnic minorities on both sides of the camera and 
there weren't before. There are black producers, directors and technicians . . 
. that's a notable change from when I first arrived, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
St. Jacques then lauded the more realistic portrayal of black experience. 
"There are audiences going to see movies like 'Sounder' and 'Claudine' and a 
few others. I'm a swinger but 'Superfly' had me out the door. . . . That's one 
film that did have an effect, and not good. Why does it have to be pimps and 
pushers on the screen all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
His motion picture credits also included "Mister Moses" in 1965, "Mister 
Buddwing" in 1966, "The Comedians" in 1967 and "The Green Berets" in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
His was also a familiar face on a variety of television shows. He most recently 
portrayed the judge on the syndicated TV show "Superior Court." 
</P>
<P>
St. Jacques is survived by his mother, Vivienne, and a sister, Barbara Birt, 
both of New Haven, Conn. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

MORLEY CALLAGHAN; CANADIAN WRITER, HEMINGWAY COMRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Morley Callaghan, a highly respected Canadian writer who was a contemporary of 
Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, has died in Toronto. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan's son Barry, also a writer, said his father died on Saturday after 
hospitalization and surgery for an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Callaghan's novels included "The Loved and the Lost," "They Shall 
Inherit the Earth," "The Many Colored Coat," and "A Fine and Private Place." 
</P>
<P>
His more than 100 short stories were published in major magazines including the 
New Yorker, the Saturday Evening Post, Harper's Bazaar and Esquire. 
</P>
<P>
Among Callaghan's best known books was "That Summer in Paris," an account of 
his friendship with Hemingway and Fitzgerald when they were living in Paris in 
the late 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan, who published three novels before he was 30, shared Hemingway's and 
Fitzgerald's editor at Scribner's in New York, Maxwell Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toronto, Callaghan first became friendly with Hemingway in 1920 when 
Callaghan was still a student and working part time on the Toronto Star, where 
Hemingway was a seasoned reporter. When Callaghan moved to Paris in 1928, he 
again encountered Hemingway, who continued to encourage him in his literary 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan was invited to box with Hemingway at the American Club in Paris, an 
event he later believed clouded his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
Although four inches shorter than the 6-foot-tall, 200-pound Hemingway, 
Callaghan knocked him down. Fitzgerald was the timekeeper, and the furious 
Hemingway blamed him for deliberately letting the round go on too long. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan claimed that Fitzgerald became so engrossed in watching the fight he 
forgot to call the round at the agreed-upon one minute, suddenly exclaiming: 
"Oh, my God, I let the round go four minutes!" 
</P>
<P>
The much-discussed incident led to tensions and estrangement of all three 
writers and caused Callaghan to lament in his later years: "I'm probably better 
known for boxing with Hemingway than for anything I've written." 
</P>
<P>
Although Callaghan was well received by literary critics, including Edmund 
Wilson, who likened his work to that of Chekhov and Turgenev, the Canadian 
writer felt he suffered by repeated comparisons with Hemingway and Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by two sons, Barry and Michael. His wife died six years ago.
