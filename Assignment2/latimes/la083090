METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 84, STABBED TO DEATH IN HER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Wednesday were continuing to investigate the stabbing death of an 
84-year-old Inglewood woman whose body was discovered in her home by a neighbor 
who became concerned after the woman failed to show up for a neighborhood watch 
meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor found Sadie Hancock in her nightgown on her dining room floor 
Monday night, said Inglewood Police Department spokesman Sgt. Harold Moret. 
</P>
<P>
The single-family house in the 8700 block of 7th Avenue was not ransacked and 
police have no motives or suspects for the killing, Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock, who apparently lived alone, was last seen alive on Saturday by the 
same neighbor who later discovered her body, police said. The neighbor entered 
Hancock's house through an unlocked door.

DEBATE OVER BUSH'S ACTIONS IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is remarkable that the reasonable Casey Kasem and many in the Arab community 
accuse the United States of a double standard when we sent troops to Saudi 
Arabia and instituted an economic blockade against Iraq but did nothing when 
"Israel invaded Lebanon." Did Kuwait attack Iraq or even threaten Iraq? Israel 
tolerated being harassed and shot at with missiles from PLO bases in Lebanon 
for a long time before it went into Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the United States practices a double standard since we do not 
force Israel out of the West Bank and Gaza. How can he disregard the fact that 
the Arab nations had all those territories until they staged their invasions 
and were defeated? Except for Egypt, they refuse to negotiate and are still in 
a state of war against Israel. What kind of a logical equation is this?

<TEXT>
<P>
Clark's column capped an unusually newsy day. Beyond the pornographic promises 
and the pathetic head-patting, Clark made clear that Bush has been puttering 
around on more than a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
It remains grotesque, as Bush continues his vacation and Hussein tries to win 
"Iraqi's Funniest Hostage Videos," that both presidents are operating as 
mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
America does have a Constitution to determine how we engage our military. Is it 
unreasonable to shout for a congressional vote in this darkened theater of war? 
Congress still has the power to overturn Bush's decision, and it would be good 
for Americans to see our President's hand so slapped. After all, the defense 
budget has already been saved, so let's save some lives.

STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your article "Community College System Is Failing" (Part A, Aug. 12), state 
Community College Chancellor David Mertes complains he's unable to fill top 
administrative positions in his office because he cannot offer salaries greater 
than $100,000 per year (plus benefits, of course). Mertes makes $101,000 and 
wants to pay his chief deputy $107,888. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Personnel Administration has approved "only" $86,533. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, San Diego Community College Chancellor William Wenrich announced he 
will cancel his $105,000 district contract after only two years because he 
could not resist the $140,000 pay offered by the Dallas Community College 
System. If we are paying administrators more than $100,000 and our college 
system is still failing, will it improve if we give them another 
$25,000-$50,000? Why are we paying administrators two, three and even four 
times the amount we pay teachers who have the ultimate responsibility for 
educating our citizens? 
</P>
<P>
Schools must not allow themselves to be forced into bidding wars. We must seek 
individuals who are eager to meet the challenge of turning around an 
educational system in crisis, not those simply seeking high-salaried career 
opportunities.

CUBAN-AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Cubans Look for Some Material Changes in Socialismo," by Murray 
Fromson, and "The Futility of Nipping at Castro's Heels," by George Black, 
Opinion, Aug. 5: 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that Fromson and Black are prejudiced against Cuban-Americans. 
Fromson describes us as "paranoid"; Black says that we are the "radical right 
wing of the Republican Party in south Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Labeling an ethnic group is racist. 
</P>
<P>
Black's irrational hatred is also obvious when he says: "And how can Castro be 
expected to talk with exiles who dream openly of turning the island into a 
dependency of Dade County and have a violent 30-year history of collusion with 
the CIA?" The Cuban-American community is not responsible for the actions of 
the CIA. This is an agency of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The label of "violent" to a community of more than 1 million people is racist 
and false. As for the allegation that we want to turn Cuba "into a dependency 
of Dade County," as a Cuban, I have to tell you that we only want to see our 
country free and democratic.

FIVE-INCH MOUNTAIN IN THE CAPITOL; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN IN THE SEAT OF STATE GOVERNMENT, A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR CAN'T FIND A 
PROPERLY EQUIPPED BATHROOM.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOLTE, Bill Bolte is writer and a disabled-rights activist in Culver 
City.Even in our state Legislature, a guy in a wheelchair can't find a properly 
equipped bathroom. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My intention was to observe a Sacramento protest demonstration by my fellow 
disabled people against the recent Deukmejian budget proposal. I had driven all 
night from Los Angeles to keep the heat from further disabling me and my aging 
van. I found a blue-curb spot outside the Capitol, dropped the wheelchair lift 
and headed for some breakfast in the cafeteria in the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Israel of the State Police confided to me in the rotunda that the 
disabled had demonstrated every week for the last three weeks -- about 40 the 
first two weeks and about 80 the week before. "They're all very nice. We just 
push their wheelchairs out and they don't resist." He paused, then added, 
"Nothing like the farm workers. When they came, they really tore up the place." 
</P>
<P>
Soon I was ready to tear up the place myself. 
</P>
<P>
All a wanted to do was use a toilet. But many years after the passage of access 
laws, and after an enormously expensive renovation of the Capitol, the only 
thing changed was that the doors were wide enough to get in with a wheelchair. 
The pressure needed to open the door was just as vault-like as in the old days, 
though regulations had long called for a two-thirds reduction. The mirror, 
dispensers, sinks -- and most important, the toilets -- were at traditional 
levels. As I transferred from my wheelchair to the toilet seat, I knew I was in 
for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The legal regulations call for handicapped toilets 19 inches high -- level with 
most wheelchair seats. Additionally, many of us use heavy, sophisticated 
cushions to prevent pressure sores, adding to the wheelchair height. These 
Capitol toilet seats were less than 14 inches high. Supercrip Mark Wellman may 
climb El Capitan with his arms, but many of us power-wheelchair users do not 
have the strength to raise ourselves five inches up and then swing to the side. 
I was trapped. I could not get off the toilet seat. 
</P>
<P>
I struggled. I tried every angle, every leverage point. I wanted to tear out 
those bars supposedly installed to help the disabled. They hemmed me in and 
kept me from getting the angle I needed. They were installed at the standard 
height for a high toilet seat. Only a double-jointed hyena could use the bars 
to help here. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, dripping with sweat, I began dismantling my wheelchair. I carefully 
removed the arm with the power control, laying it on the floor. I removed the 
pedals. I removed the heavy cushion and propped it against the wall. I put the 
brakes on. 
</P>
<P>
A final effort got one cheek on the seat of the wheelchair. Reassembling the 
chair and getting the cushion under me involved another herculean effort. 
</P>
<P>
As I washed my hands, wiping the sweat from the face I could barely see in the 
high mirror, I wondered when genuine, material, equal opportunity would arrive 
for the millions of disabled people who are manufactured each year in our 
factories and on our highways, shot in our slums, overdosed in our suburbs, or 
simply invaded by the wrong virus. Here in the Capitol of the state alleged to 
be the leader in progress for the disabled, a disabled person still cannot go 
to the toilet without contortionist efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as I watched the sweating handful of California's disabled gather to 
protest funding cuts proposed by the governor, I couldn't help questioning the 
focus of the demonstration leaders. They were trying to save a group of 
independent-living centers designed to serve the disabled. As worthy as these 
agencies may be -- and their effectiveness is profoundly questioned by many 
disabled -- the money at issue is a piddling $5 million out of cuts of 
thousands of millions. With such narrow, self-serving leadership, is it any 
wonder that the Capitol toilets are still unusable by many disabled people, 
decades after regulations requiring access? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what the disabled need is a militant union and a leader from among them 
like Cesar Chavez. I hear that before he came alog, farm workers, too, didn't 
have toilets to use when they were out working in the field. 
</P>
<P>
That night, as I headed west in search of a cool place to sleep in the van, I 
couldn't help but wonder at how little had changed in California. The governor 
and Legislature seem to be once again in the hands of the robber barons. Even 
the initiative process introduced by the reformer Hiram Johnson seems to be in 
their grasp. And here I was, just trying to find a cool Target or K-Mart 
parking lot where the cops wouldn't hassle me for sleeping in a 10-year-old van 
with 105,000 miles on it.

Louis Inferrera, Joe Hayes, Charles As selta, Lance Jenkins . . . schoolmates 
from a now-distant past in a small working-class town in New Jersey, they've 
been much on my mind in recent days as we contemplate the prospect of war with 
Iraq. Good kids, patriotic and vibrantly physical, their young lives came to an 
abrupt halt in the jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
More than two decades later, no one can say for sure what it was they died for. 
I remember, in particular, Joe Hayes, a quiet Appalachian boy, already 6-foot-1 
and 180 pounds in the sixth grade, winning a softball-throwing contest with a 
heave that soared and soared, seeming for a long moment as if it would never 
come down. Seven years later, he was gone and so, too, were the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Kellogg, Lincoln Caplan II, Rupert Simpson, Mark Kelman . . . 
classmates from a somewhat more recent past, they, too, have been on my mind. 
Fellow students at Harvard College in the late 1960s and early '70s, they've 
flourished. Some are now well-known, others quietly prosperous, but all of them 
-- and myself -- had the good fortune of being thousands of miles away from the 
carnage then occurring in Vietnam. It is said, perhaps with a bit of 
exaggeration, that only one Harvard draftee died in Vietnam. Yet before I 
entered Harvard, two classmates from my public high-school homeroom of 30 had 
already perished. 
</P>
<P>
It is now well-established that death in Vietnam was linked to class; to take 
but one example, a study of high-school seniors in Wisconsin showed that the 
children of poor families had a casualty rate twice that of their better-off 
classmates. Yet as long as there was a draft, there was at least the 
possibility -- however remote -- that the children of the privileged might find 
themselves facing hostile fire. And it was that possibility that gave the 
anti-war movement, especially on the campuses, some of its power. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the nation confronts fateful decisions in its escalating conflict with 
Iraq, we have no conscript army. Not surprisingly, the offspring of the rich 
and the powerful are overwhelmingly absent from among the "volunteer" forces. 
Present, though, are large numbers of minority and working-class youths; of the 
1,800,000 enlisted troops in the military in 1988, 22% were black (compared to 
12% for the population as a whole) and only 7% had completed even a year of 
college (compared to more than one-third of all young people). These are the 
people who would bear the brunt of any shooting war. 
</P>
<P>
Would our nation's leaders be so willing to risk war if our Army was -- like 
those of most of our European allies -- a conscript one, brought together by a 
draft that touches rich and poor alike? Imagine, for example, that the children 
of physicians and corporate executives were as likely as the children of 
factory workers and farmers to face death in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, in short, that this was a war that would demand truly collective 
sacrifice, risking the lives of youths not only from Kankakee and Texas 
A&amp;M, but also from Scarsdale and Stanford. Perhaps those who shape policy 
and public opinion would have a rather different view of the U.S.-Iraqi 
conflict if this were the case. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, it is said, poses a grave threat to the geopolitical interests of the 
West, and so it may be. Yet where, one might ask, are our now-wealthy Western 
allies? After all, they are far more dependent on Middle Eastern oil than we 
and their geographical proximity to the region is much greater. But, words and 
gestures aside, they have shown no serious willingness to put the lives of 
their young on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the unpalatable reality of the situation -- often lost amid exultation 
at the unexpected solidarity of the response of the international community to 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait -- is that no Western nation is volunteering to 
stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the young American men and women who may soon 
find themselves in a brutal desert war. 
</P>
<P>
Though Iraq is not a world power, neither is it Panama or Grenada. A full-scale 
war would be costly indeed. Not all Americans would be asked to pay the price 
for such a confrontation, for it is the Joe Hayeses and the Louis Inferreras of 
today who would do most of the bleeding and dying. Out of respect for their 
memory and for our collective future, let us think -- and think hard -- before 
we act.

HOSTAGES: IRAQ'S INTENT IS NOT THE SAME AS IRAN'S, BUT THE SAME IRREVERSIBLE 
MESS WILL RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABOLHASSAN BANI-SADR, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr was president of Iran from 
January, 1980, to June, 1981, when he was ousted by backers of the Ayatollah 
Khomeini. He lives in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hostage-taking, as I know from my experience in the government of Iran when 
American diplomats were taken hostage in 1979, is an irreversible act. It 
reflects a state of relations between two powers in conflict from which there 
is no going back. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage-taking is based on a solid logic with clear objectives in mind. At the 
same time, paradoxically, it reveals common interests held by the parties in 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the act contradicted the original aim of the revolution. Before the 
hostages were taken, our revolutionary efforts were directed at replacing all 
foreign influences with Iranian elements. The taking of hostages contradicted 
this effort because it locked our fate into that of the West. Although militant 
and "anti-imperialist" in tone and form, taking Americans actually confirmed 
Iranian preoccupation with U.S. power as the core of world relations. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, were the hostages seized? Because Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini wanted 
to establish a religious dictatorship in Iran and in the process neutralize the 
intellectuals, the majority of religious figures, the urban middle class and 
the workers. With the taking of American hostages, Khomeini found he could 
conveniently enlist the "Great Satan" as hisco-conspirator against the forces 
of democracy and moderation at home. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking also served American foreign-policy interests because, 
ironically, it helped re-establish the influence of the West in Iranian affairs 
and dashed the independent character of our revolution. It also served 
particular interests in the United States. The protracted "humiliation" of 
America by the mullahs helped the Republicans capture the White House from 
Jimmy Carter. In this, I am convinced, Republican Party elements and the 
ayatollahs consciously conspired. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has taken hostages for different reasons. With his power already 
well-established at home, he wants to impose Iraqi hegemony over the region, 
for reasons of pan-Arab ideology and the practical necessity of solving his 
financial difficulties. Hussein probably did not at first figure hostage-taking 
into his aggressive scenario for Kuwait. However, the surprising resolve of 
America's reaction forced him to take hostages as bargaining chips for his 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, here again, an objective convergence of interests is revealed between 
Saddam Hussein and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's gamble is that the hostages will enable a diplomatic settlement that 
will leave him with his Kuwaiti spoils and an appeal in the Arab world for 
standing up against the West. The longer the hostage situation produces a 
standoff, the stronger his anti-West appeal becomes, especially as the Islamic 
world gets closer to the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca next May and June. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the hostage crisis in Iraq may end up providing Hussein with a 
legitimate appeal to mask his hegemonic ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the hostages have generated an emotional investment in 
defending the Saudi monarchy and retrieving the power of Kuwaiti emirs that 
Hussein's invasion alone could not have elicited. This helps ensure popular 
backing for the reassertion of American power in the world and reinforces the 
U.S. military-industrial complex that was on the wane in the aftermath of the 
Cold War.

(Ferguson's resolution) is worrisome. There are always ignorant people. What 
worries me most is that people like him can get to a position that they can 
affect so many lives. Our system does allow for even foolish or stupid or 
malicious people to be represented. 
</P>
<P>
I do think that all of us, including the Japanese-Americans, have learned from 
the incarceration experience. I think we learned that citizenship is a 
responsibility. Unless one participates, people like Ferguson will prevail. The 
Japanese community, I think, has learned from this.

REPORT SAYS WOMEN IN SPORTS ARE NOT TREATED FAIRLY BY TV

Women athletes don't get their fair share of television time and the coverage 
of them is sexist, according to a study released Wednesday by the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that only 5% of television sports news on a sample station was 
devoted to women athletes, that females frequently were called "girls" instead 
of "women" and that men's telecasts use more high-tech equipment and 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"The current practice tends to trivialize women athletes," said Anita DeFrantz, 
the foundation's president. "There are non-economic solutions." 
</P>
<P>
The study examined coverage of the 1989 U.S. Open tennis championship and the 
1989 NCAA men's and women's basketball Final Fours on CBS as well as six weeks 
of local sportscasts on KNBC-TV of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz said women appear on sports telecasts "as comic relief or a sex 
symbol," many times appearing only in shots of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto said: "We do not understand how any survey can 
distribute such findings without having a fair and balanced sampling of all 
stations' newscasts within the market." Sportscaster Fred Roggin declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Sports defended its women's tennis and basketball coverage, but executive 
producer Ted Shaker said: "I think she makes some valid points. Some of the 
points one could argue. I think that the fact that conversations of this kind 
take place and are considered by intelligent people who in their hearts care, I 
think that's good."

SENSATIONAL STAR TURNS IN ANOTHER SENSATIONAL WIN IN O'BRIEN SPRINT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning its sixth week, Del Mar attracted 13,706 fans Wednesday. But it only 
seemed like all of them were in the winner's circle after Sensational Star's 
victory in the $108,025 Pat O'Brien Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
There was barely room for the 6-year-old gelding amid the mob of owners and 
their entourages after his nearly three-length beating of Frost Free, the 5-2 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly in the lead throughout the race, Sensational Star, who was claimed 
for $32,000 by trainer Bill Spawr two years ago, put away Sam Who after a 
half-mile, then drew off to win in 1:20 3/5 for the seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Victorious for the third time in four 1990 starts and successful in 12 of 35 
races overall, Sensational Star isn't the first Spawr claim to go on and win a 
stakes. Mister Gennaro and Restage also did, but the trainer said this just 
might be his best purchase. A month earlier, the California-bred had scored a 
14-1 upset in the Bing Crosby Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"He's something, isn't he?" said Spawr, consistently one of Southern 
California's high-percentage trainers. "He's so good now, I can't believe it. I 
knew he'd fire another big shot here. He's doing so fabulously. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best he's ever been. I told Rafael (Meza) to let him roll out of 
there. I thought if Frost Free went to the front, we could lay right on him. I 
wasn't surprised at all the way the race went. 
</P>
<P>
"He might be the best claim I ever made. Oh, heck, he is the best claim I ever 
made. He's a gentleman to be around. He's a classy, classy horse." 
</P>
<P>
Sensational Star also gets along well with Meza, who rode him in his last four 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look like there was a lot of speed in there," Meza said after his 
third stakes win of the meeting. "My main concern was to run our race and not 
worry about anybody else. I just wanted to get a good break, and he broke 
super. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw they took Frost Free back, and Sam Who was inside of me, and we were 
going pretty comfortably (in 22 flat, then 44 1/5 for the half-mile). The way 
he was going early, I knew he'd be tough at the end. It felt like he was 
galloping early. He's better at seven furlongs than six." 
</P>
<P>
Frost Free finished three-quarters of a length in front of a troubled Earn Your 
Stripes. Timeless Answer was fourth; then came Due to the King, Sam Who, 
Movinglikeawinner, Trebizond and Flying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
"I either wanted to be on the lead or where I was," said Gary Stevens, although 
many would argue that his mount, Frost Free, is effective only when he's in 
front. "I wanted to make sure I had something to finish with. I went after 
(Sensational Star) at the three-eighths pole and hoped to flatten him out. But 
the other horse is real good now . . . Give him all the credit." 
</P>
<P>
Sensational Star earned $49,275 for owners Tony Calhoun, Larry Risoldi and John 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Not eligible to the Breeders' Cup, Sensational Star's agenda calls for starts 
in the Ancient Title on Oct. 10 and the California Cup Sprint on Nov. 3 at 
Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting, with a possible try in the Aprisa at Fairplex 
Park next month. 
</P>
<P>
With Prized, Golden Pheasant and Classic Fame aiming for the Arlington Million 
and with Petite Ile injured, Monday's $300,000 Del Mar Handicap is not shaping 
up as one of the year's attractive races. 
</P>
<P>
The starting highweight for the stake, at 1 3/8 miles on the turf, is Live the 
Dream with 118 pounds, followed by Great Communicator, who has definitely seen 
better days, with 117. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 12 invitees in the race, won last year by Payant, are probable 
starters. Besides the two mentioned, the likely participants are Deliorman, 
Rial, Eddie Read Handicap winner Fly Till Dawn, Chief's Image, Lowell, 
Mashkour, Soft Machine and Mehmetori. Putting, who wasn't invited originally, 
is a strong possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than go to New York for Sunday's Maskette Stakes at Belmont Park, 
Bayakoa will stay home and run in the $150,000-added Chula Vista Handicap here 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Set to carry 127 pounds, Bayakoa will be spotting from 13 to 16 pounds to her 
five possible opponents -- Patches, Estrella Fuega, Rosadora and the Gary 
Jones-trained duo of Formidable Lady and Fantastic Look. 
</P>
<P>
"If we sent her to New York, we don't know who we're going to run against," 
trainer Ron McAnally said. "Here we know. 
</P>
<P>
"We also would have to either leave her back there a month for her next start 
in the Spinster (on Oct. 6 at Keeneland) or bring her right back and take her 
back again. This way we can keep her here for at least three weeks, where we 
know the weather will be good, then take her to Kentucky and on to the 
Breeders' Cup (on Oct. 27 at Belmont)." 
</P>
<P>
Although last in the 1989 Chula Vista when heavily favored, Bayakoa worked 
seven furlongs in 1:23 3/5 last Saturday, preparing for her first start since 
being upset by Quiet American in the San Diego Handicap on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Corey Nakatani, who has been out a month with a broken hand, will return 
to action Saturday. Nakatani broke his hand in a fight with fellow rider 
Orlando Garrido at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the Molson Export Challenge at Woodbine on Sept. 9, Kansas City 
worked a mile in 1:37 between the second and third races Wednesday. With new 
rider Chris McCarron aboard, the 3-year-old Habitony colt went 23 3/5, 47 1/5 
and 1:11 4/5 en route to his final clocking. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar will play host to an All-Star Jockey Challenge on Sept. 9. Local riders 
Laffit Pincay, Eddie Delahoussaye, Pat Valenzuela and Kent Desormeaux will be 
pitted against Pat Day, Jorge Velasquez, Randy Romero and Earlie Fires. The 
competition will consist of three races with eight horses in each race. There 
will then be a second challenge on Sept. 30 at Arlington Park.

Tumor Removed: Former first lady Nancy Reagan Wednesday had a small cancerous 
tumor removed, just beneath her left nostril, a family spokesman said at St. 
Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn. In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital 
removed her left breast and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
She is otherwise in excellent health, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
No Go: Mothers Against Drunk Driving will not be allowed to parade images of 
death at a wine festival in Kalamazoo, Mich. MADD's display was to have 
featured headstones for the Sept. 8 parade. The float was turned down because 
its theme wasn't consistent with the rest of the parade, said event chairman 
Brian Caplan. Michael Hughes, president of the local MADD chapter, wasn't 
worried about drinking at the event: "I'm worried about when they get behind 
the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
Right Rub: Pia Zadora had a stiff neck when she went to WNBC-TV in New York for 
an interview recently, so her hairdresser began rubbing it. Sen. Al D'Amato 
(R-N.Y.) also happened to be in the studio and said: "Here, let me try that," 
according to the New York Daily News. Said Zadora: "He managed to get rid of 
the cricks in my neck without so much as breaking his chain of thought." 
</P>
<P>
Doing Better: Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the world's first successful 
liver transplant in 1967, was released from Pittsburgh's Presbyterian 
University Hospital Tuesday, four days after undergoing a coronary artery 
bypass. Starzl, 64, has performed hundreds of transplant operations at the same 
hospital.

JACK SMITH: WAR TECHNOLOGY ASIDE, WHAT ABOUT THE HUMAN FACTOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time you read this, it will probably be out of date. I want to say 
something about the crisis in the Middle East; but of course it changes every 
hour, and events quickly overtake predictions. 
</P>
<P>
I believe I have read every word printed in The Times about it, including the 
pontifications of Henry Kissinger. I envy our reporters who are on the scene in 
Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
I notice, though, that reporters often quote Pentagon or Administration sources 
who ask to remain anonymous. Also, our commitment to the Middle East is most 
often expressed in terms of technology. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, for example, a Page 1 story reviewed our military situation in 
Saudi Arabia. It said that our forces there "include the 7th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade, equipped with tanks, heavy artillery and Cobra attack 
helicopters, and attack-oriented naval forces aboard aircraft carriers armed 
with A-6 attack bombers, F-18s and EA-6 attack bombers, and EA-6B radar jamming 
planes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Well, that sounds great. If it comes down to a military confrontation, our 
technology should prevail. 
</P>
<P>
But so far I haven't read much about the human factor. War is fought, in the 
end, by people. My only experience with it was the battle of Iwo Jima, but I 
still remember it in human terms. We were told that the reason for attacking 
Iwo was to secure it as an emergency landing field for B-29 bombers returning 
from their devastating raids on Tokyo. And I remember seeing the first B-29 
land. For that we paid 7,000 dead Marines. 
</P>
<P>
My battalion approached Iwo on an LST (landing ship-tank). The weather was bad. 
Being overcrowded, many of us had to sleep topside, in our bags. When the gale 
came, we were doused. But one of us, a man named Blake, had ingenuity and 
foresight. He had rigged up a tent, using blankets and sticks, and came out dry 
the next day. "I build my house of bricks," he said, smiling slyly. 
</P>
<P>
Blake wanted to be a chemical engineer. I think he would have been a good one. 
He was blown away on D-day. 
</P>
<P>
I was scheduled to land in the third wave, at 0910. We landed at 0910, exactly. 
One of the men in my boat looked up at an airplane and his helmet fell off into 
the ocean. A Navy patrol boat came alongside and a swabbie (Marine talk for 
sailor) gave his helmet to the embarrassed Marine. (By the way, he survived.) 
</P>
<P>
We landed. I soon found myself in a shell hole with two other men. I suggested 
that it might be prudent to get out of that hole, on the theory that the enemy 
might be zeroed in on it. They agreed. They went first. I climbed out just as a 
shell hit. One of the men who had preceded me had disappeared. The other was 
kneeling, as if in prayer. His head was gone. 
</P>
<P>
I scrambled into a bigger hole. I was soon joined by a man named Zimmy. He was 
a Czech, a banker from Chicago. His specialty was the ability to speak 
Japanese. It didn't seem to be of much use at the moment. I said, "Funny place 
for a bad Czech to turn up." He didn't laugh. We dug a common foxhole and 
survived the night, surrounded by mortar shells. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning I wandered out into an unsecured zone. Suddenly I realized that 
I was being shot at. I heard the crack of bullets passing. "Crazy," I thought. 
"Why would anybody want to kill me?" 
</P>
<P>
Later I found our battalion headquarters. The colonel and the captain were 
eating some canned sausage. "Why don't you go have some," the colonel 
suggested, "with the enlisted men?" 
</P>
<P>
I excused myself. A few minutes later the colonel stood up to study the 
Japanese positions through his field glasses. A mortar shell landed nearby. The 
colonel was killed. 
</P>
<P>
I had a specialty. I was a combat correspondent. I carried a rifle and was 
supposed to shoot the enemy. But my primary duty was to write stories about 
individual Marines for their home town newspapers. There were two of us in 
every regiment. The other man in my regiment was Barberio. Everybody loved him. 
He was full of life and he loved to eat. 
</P>
<P>
We were supposed to carry our Corona portable typewriters with us in the 
assault. I remember the morning we embarked. Barberio was loaded with 
everything required, and someone had to give him a push to get him going. 
</P>
<P>
I balked. I went to the colonel and said, "Sir, I am supposed to carry my 
typewriter ashore with me." He said, "You will not.' 
</P>
<P>
The colonel suggested that I send my typewriter in his jeep, which was 
scheduled to go in the eighth wave. The boat was sunk. I never saw my 
typewriter again. 
</P>
<P>
Barberio was killed on D-day. A Marine salvaged his typewriter, and offered it 
to me. I felt guilty. Barberio had gone by the book. I had not. I used my knife 
to open the case. There was no typewriter in it. It was full of canned goods. 
</P>
<P>
That's what war is like. Only a thousand times worse.

Three years after the idea was proposed by the Kiwanis Club of Santa Ana the 
plan is being put into action: A park is being built within Thornton Park on 
Segerstrom Avenue to provide a playground for handicapped children, where 
basketball courts have adjustable hoops and swings can accommodate wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis Club proposed the 6 1/2-acre, "barrier-free" facility after members 
had worked with students at Santa Ana's Carl Harvey School for physically 
handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a grassy, 30-acre stretch of land in the park's northern section, 
the facility will include two basketball courts, a playground, special trails 
to the park's lake and a camping area with bathrooms accessible to the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis Club will not be able to fund the project by itself and is seeking 
the support of other organizations. The estimated cost of the park, according 
to club president Angel Rivas, is at least $300,000, most of which will go into 
buying playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no park like this in the county," Rivas said. "Once this is built, 
handicapped kids from throughout the county can come here and play." 
</P>

The South Coast Symphony Youth Orchestra in residence at the Orange County High 
School of the Arts is currently seeking talented young musicians to participate 
in the group's coming international tour to East and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble, under the direction of Scott Speck, will leave next summer for a 
10-day trip, which includes concerts on both sides of the crumbled Berlin Wall, 
as well as other picturesque locations around Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This will mark the second international tour for the group. Last year's season 
included a four-concert trip to Quebec, Canada. The group and its members have 
also performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 17th season, the South Coast Symphony Youth Orchestra joined OCHSA 
on the Marina High School campus in Huntington Beach in 1988. In addition to 
its weekly rehearsals, orchestra members have the option of attending chamber 
orchestra practice, advanced sectional rehearsals taught by professional 
orchestra musicians and classes in music history, theory, orchestration, 
composition and conducting -- all free. 
</P>
<P>
For information about the orchestra or to schedule an audition, contact OCHSA 
at (213) 596-1435.

'AUGUST 29': CHICANO ANGST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You know the old saying about too many cooks. It can apply in the theater as 
well as in the kitchen, and it is to the credit of the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center's Latino Theatre Lab that the play they created collectively under the 
pseudonym Violeta Calles (a rakish stand-in for "violent streets") avoids 
spoiling the caldo. 
</P>
<P>
"August 29," seen at a press preview Tuesday, is a rousing tribute not so much 
to the fallen newsman Ruben Salazar, but more perhaps to what he has come to 
represent in the 20 years since he was killed by a 10-inch tear-gas projectile 
that pierced his skull. 
</P>
<P>
It was launched by a sheriff's deputy into the Silver Dollar Bar in East Los 
Angeles, where Salazar had stopped for a beer. He was covering the Chicano 
Moratorium of Aug. 29, 1970, when, nobody quite knows why, the peaceful march 
from Belvedere Park to Laguna Park (now Salazar Park), turned into a riot. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who had been a Times bureau chief in Mexico City and still wrote a 
weekly column for the paper, was then news director at KMEX. Was he a victim of 
random violence or a targeted man? The question was never satisfactorily 
answered, but he became a powerful symbol in his death. 
</P>
<P>
The lab ensemble and director Jose Luis Valenzuela have attempted to dramatize 
the present in the light of the past, hoping to assess how things have changed 
-- not necessarily for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Evelina Fernandez plays Lucero, a Chicana activist at the time of the 
Moratorium who has since become a "chuppie" (a Chicano yuppie), complete with 
nice apartment, stylish clothes and BMW (license plate: PHD). A respected 
college professor and historian, Lucero is writing a book on Salazar that she 
considers her ticket to tenure. 
</P>
<P>
But a favorite student becomes a victim of police brutality. And when Lucero 
resists pressure from friends and ex-comrades in activism to publicly denounce 
the incident, she's forced to confront herself and re-examine her values. 
</P>
<P>
This takes us on a journey of reminiscence and re-enactment wherein Lucero is 
assisted, or at least prodded, by the presence of an imaginary Salazar (E.J. 
Castillo). His desire to know all that has happened since he died is a 
convenient device for a look at how times have changed and how Chicanos -- now 
known as "Hispanics," or what Lucero's friend Molly (Angela Moya) calls "the H 
word" -- have become as complacent and self-involved as the rest of the 
citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a theatrically correct piece that pours a little salsa on the 
expected. Using rear projections of Aug. 29 footage, as well as vivid 
abstractions by set designers Douglas D. Smith and Gronk, it offers a nostalgic 
look at the spent ardor of the '70s and the bloodlessness of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
It does not quite sink to separating history into good guys and bad guys, but 
even while "August 29" acknowledges that Salazar's early writings were 
politically noncommittal and his lifestyle more Anglo than Chicano, it only 
glances off the issues rather than digging into them with bared fangs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is an aura of calculation that such manufactured pieces have 
trouble averting, and a few too many halos to pass around. But Valenzuela has 
directed with dispatch and the acting is balanced and buoyant throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo and Fernandez do a nimble, restrained dance around the issues, 
skillfully touching history and each other. Vanessa Marquez is a bit too soft 
to be believable as the militant young Lucy, while Sal Lopez is so sweetly 
jocular as Benny, the boyfriend who betrays her, that it's hard to accept him 
as the traitor he is in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Abel Franco and Lupe Ontiveros, the lab's all-purpose Latino parents, are 
especially successful as Lucero's -- neither overly rambunctious and 
stereotypical nor overly subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Moya and Mike Gomez are forceful as Lucero's activist friends (and in other 
cameos), and a nod goes to Tony Maggio, playing a virtual gallery of cops and 
other villains, to whom he manages to impart distinctive individual traits. 
</P>
<P>
What one had hoped for was more meat on the bones. We get a listing and a 
naming of what's still terribly wrong for Hispanics/Latinos/Chicanos today -- 
plenty -- but not much more. The play is a Cook's Tour of issues, not a 
penetrating expedition into the underbrush.

O.C. POP BEAT: CHRISTIAN ROCKERS GO BEYOND PULPIT; 
</P>
<P>
THREE ORANGE COUNTY BANDS RELEASE NEW ALBUMS THAT, TO VARYING EXTENTS, REACH 
OUT BEYOND A CIRCLE OF CONFIRMED BELIEVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Individualism is the indispensable ingredient of good rock music. A strong, 
proud, independent streak that challenges dogma and received wisdom, declaring 
the right to think and speak for oneself, to hold and express a personal vision 
-- that is the rocker's greatest gift, and it is rock's greatest claim to being 
a popular art form, rather than merely a form that is popular. Rock is -- or 
ought to be -- the performer's diary, and the audience's bulletin board: lived 
experience, set to a backbeat. 
</P>
<P>
When rock labels itself as specifically "Christian" in outlook, essence and 
substance, it comes up against a strong, probably insurmountable pressure to 
compromise the above artistic ideals in favor of religious ones. 
</P>
<P>
With "Christian rock," the need to proclaim a set of beliefs is apt to limit 
the rocker's ability to test extreme ideas and forms of expression. The 
performer also may feel obligated to say a great deal about God, while 
subordinating his or her own experience, ideas, and expressive voice. The work 
of the "Christian rocker" becomes evangelism by other means, a way of girding 
confirmed believers' faith and winning new adherents. Undoubtedly, "Christian 
rock" has value as a religious activity. But it is of little interest to lovers 
of rock who want to experience the music's physical and emotional impact 
without being proselytized. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, spirituality and religious feeling have inspired some of the 
finest rock music. Bob Dylan (the universalist Dylan of "John Wesley Harding," 
"I Shall Be Released" and "Father of Night," rather than the cranky sectarian 
of "Slow Train Coming" and "Saved"), Van Morrison, Prince -- all of these have 
managed to depict spiritual experience in ways that are unconventional, highly 
individualistic and loath to proselytize. There is no dogma binding the Van 
Morrison of "In the Garden," or the Pete Townshend of "And I Moved," two songs 
that portray divine encounters as moments of transcendent sexual intimacy. The 
themes are religious, but the vision and expression are the singer's own. 
</P>
<P>
Three Orange County rock acts that have been identified with the Christian rock 
movement have new albums out that, to varying extents, reach out beyond a 
circle of Christian believers. 
</P>
<P>
Stryper, the best-known and best-selling Christian hard-rock act, seems to have 
recognized how confining it is to work within the quotation marks of "Christian 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
While still informed by Christian principles, Stryper has decided it no longer 
needs to thump the Bible at every turn. Amen to that. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stand, singer of the Altar Boys, has never been a mouthpiece for religious 
dogma, but his second solo album suffers from a malady that afflicts 
songwriters of all persuasions: an inability to dig down deep for the specific 
details that can turn broad, abstract notions into vivid slices of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Elias and the Confessions arrive with a superb debut album that merges 
Elias' Christian convictions with a true rocker's insistence on thinking and 
doing things in a way that is uniquely his own. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
STRYPER 
</P>
<P>
"Against the Law" (Enigma) 
</P>
<P>
If ever a band needed to be born again, it was the Stryper of 1988's awful "In 
God We Trust" album. Slick and gutless, the sound was closer to warmed-over 
Boston than to credible heavy metal. Lyrically, meanwhile, the band was glued 
to the most wooden pro-Jesus sloganeering imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
"Against the Law" is Stryper's assertion that it ought to be able to talk about 
life in terms other than the language of the pulpit. It's also Stryper's 
re-assertion that it is a metal band, not some gussied up, unconvincing hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
The reborn Stryper doesn't exactly brim over with imagination: "Against the 
Law" falls solidly within heavy metal's sonic conventions, although it at least 
dips into several different ones. 
</P>
<P>
The album includes a pop-metal power ballad, some Aerosmith-style heavy boogie, 
galloping speed-metal, and a hard-hitting, but not cohesive, funk-metal cover 
of the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song, "Shining Star." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sweet's rangy voice spearheads big, sing-along choruses, the rhythm 
section rumbles hard enough to make heads bang, and the guitars, while anchored 
to the too-familiar metal whine-and-wail style, at least avoid that style's 
worst excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Though avoiding specifically Christian imagery, Stryper continues to contradict 
metal's typically heathen values. That remains the band's most interesting 
facet in songs like "Not That Kind of Guy," which gives a disdainful brushoff 
to the sort of libidinous groupie who most hard rockers pray will come knocking 
at the stage door. 
</P>
<P>
While the lyrics trumpet steadfast restraint, the music maintains a hot, sexual 
pulse that embodies the temptation at hand. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
MIKE STAND 
</P>
<P>
"Simple Expression" (Alarma) 
</P>
<P>
The problem here is that Stand's subject probably defies simple expression. In 
song after song, he tries to give voice to something that is beyond words -- 
the yearning to be in touch with God. Stand chronicles his reach for divine 
contact in a way far too personal to serve dogmatic purposes. But it's also far 
too abstract to be deeply communicative. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, Stand slips into a sort of religio-philosophical jargon that is 
inflated, hard to decipher, and ultimately distancing. 
</P>
<P>
We encounter vague combinations of portent-filled words: imminence change, 
reformation regeneration, condition change. Even when the diction is more 
natural, most of Stand's material remains self-consciously lofty and 
conceptual. As the album goes on, we want to know more about this 
seeker-after-God, but Stand isn't interested in telling us about himself, or 
his earthly, day-to-day surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
What worldly troubles and flaws have spurred this single-minded quest to be 
made spiritually whole? There is no inkling here. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the sameness of theme, Stand overstocks the album with chiming 
anthems built on a Byrds-style massing of Rickenbacker guitars. Stand has an 
appealingly husky, fervently straining voice that recalls Jackson Browne, full 
of conviction that conveys the depth of his longing. The emotional core is 
there, but the details, the flesh of art, are missing. 
</P>
<P>
The album has its moments. All of the ballads are pretty and evocative, with 
Stand's emotionalism served well by stark arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the album, Stand begins to mix things up. "Great Things 
Happen," with its bright, mid-tempo jangle, is followed by "I Melt Into You," 
which throbs with a raw, punk-influenced forcefulness. The song carries the 
album's most vivid impression -- but only an impression -- of the worldly pain 
Stand is trying to transcend. 
</P>
<P>
Only in one song, "Time Pressing Dance," does Stand introduce characters other 
than himself (and God). The portraits are sketchy, and the idea -- time slips 
away from us -- is conventional. But it puts Stand on the helpful tack of 
looking toward worldly embodiments of spiritual questions. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
RICK ELIAS AND THE CONFESSIONS 
</P>
<P>
"Rick Elias and the Confessions" (Alarma) 
</P>
<P>
Elias is a veteran Southern California rocker who is making his album debut, 
and it's a striking one. On the one hand, we get rock's rebellious spirit in 
angry, undiluted form: Elias is fed up with the negligence, impotence and 
hand-me-down solutions of societal and religious authorities, and he is 
determined to search for his own answers. On the other hand, we get a yearning 
for divine love that's deep and abashed and worthy of the best spiritually 
informed rock. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask me to sing like a caged pet canary, when I'm burning for freedom, 
not just sanctuary," Elias spits at one point in a trenchant R&amp;B-tinged 
rasp. This is clearly a restless soul whose search for answers isn't about to 
be bound by any limits imposed from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Elias' lyrics take swipes at the limiting forces found in religion and 
materialism alike. The Dylanesque "Streets of Rome" rejects the safe, tidy, 
suburban acquisitiveness; "Riot (Comin' On)," one of several persuasive 
Mellancamp-cum-Stones thumpers on the album, is a defiantly ticked-off song in 
which Elias, no fan of donation-seeking televangelists, tells self-anointed 
sages to put up or shut up: "Come on all you saints and wise men, come show the 
way if you can, come show us who you really are." 
</P>
<P>
At key junctures, Elias gives us a good idea who he is and why he is searching 
for spiritual answers. Allusions to hard, bitter times full of self-disgust and 
selfishness dominate "Without One Word," a clenched, gutsy acoustic ballad that 
is unrelenting in its depiction of a confused, out-of-control soul. While Elias 
grapples with spiritual concepts -- some of his songs are out-and-out prayers 
-- his music is coated with the sweat and grime of lived experience. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the song calls for a straight rock 'n' roll kick, or the more lush, 
textured sound of a number like the lustrous "Someday," Elias and his band 
sound completely assured (Elias produced this album, and also co-produced 
Stand's album). 
</P>
<P>
It's telling that when Elias sings of his moment of redemption in the opening 
song, "Confession of Love," he fuses Christian imagery with an allusion from 
the pages of rock history. 
</P>
<P>
"Well I came to the end of that deadman's street / With a heart full of soul 
where a tomb used to be," he sings, linking the title of a Yardbirds classic 
with the Christian notion of a tomb transcended. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the song, Elias can't help breaking jubilantly into one of the 
most raucous and profane vocal riffs from rock's annals, the "yeah, yeah, yeah, 
whoooo!" from the Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar." Amen to that, too.

<P>
A SELF-CONGRATULATORY MACLAINE AT THE PANTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine ended opening night of "Out There Tonight," her revue at the 
Pantages Theatre, with this admonition to the audience: "When you go out there 
tonight, do something you've never had the guts to do before." 
</P>
<P>
Look who's talking. 
</P>
<P>
"Out There Tonight" is a stale slice of ham. It's the sort of show that 
MacLaine has done, and done, and done. Angelenos saw large chunks of it at the 
Wilshire Theatre in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
It must have taken guts to keep doing this show in the wake of a knee injury 
last spring. But that's the only risk MacLaine has taken here. Though she sings 
a song in praise of going "Out on a Limb" (also the title of one of her books), 
this show is nowhere near the limb. 
</P>
<P>
So much of it is a condensed version of MacLaine's previous work that anyone 
who's unfamiliar with her career is likely to be baffled. If you don't already 
worship the ground MacLaine dances on, "Out There Tonight" is not likely to 
convert you. 
</P>
<P>
The two best items here are Stephen Sondheim's. MacLaine does a greatest-hits 
tour of the Mama Rose role from "Gypsy" (Sondheim wrote the lyrics), and she 
introduces Sondheim's updated words to his "I'm Still Here." 
</P>
<P>
While the "Gypsy" medley is hardly "out on a limb," at least it's not something 
we associate with MacLaine. She does it with the requisite fire. But in this 
context, its primary effect is to make us wonder why MacLaine hasn't done 
"Gypsy" itself. That would certainly be more interesting than another round of 
this revue. 
</P>
<P>
Sondheim's revised "I'm Still Here" is the cleverest example of 
self-congratulations in this extremely self-congratulatory show, but you need 
not buy tickets to "Out There Tonight" in order to hear it; MacLaine informs us 
that she also sings it in one of her upcoming movies. 
</P>
<P>
At least no one can say MacLaine has made a self-congratulatory grand entrance. 
After the house lights go down, the stage is filled with the hubbub of sound 
checks and warm-up exercises by the crew, seven-person band and four-person 
chorus. Suddenly, MacLaine appears in the midst of it, dressed down. With a 
ragged voice, she sings her first version of the title song, "Out There 
Tonight," in which she frets about her audience. 
</P>
<P>
She predicts that in the middle of her biggest number, someone near the front 
of the audience will get up and leave, perhaps in response to nature's call. 
Sure enough, this happened, in the middle of her Mama Rose routine, not far 
from where I was seated. Though unscripted (MacLaine gave no indication that 
she noticed), it was the funniest moment of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
After her less-than-socko opening, MacLaine changes into glitzier outfits, and 
her voice gets stronger. But the self-absorption continues. Why is she here? 
"Lord help me, I love it," she sings. She adores "Applause" -- song cue, 
please. The first big dance number is "Clap Your Hands" -- which refers not 
just to the rhythm of the song but also to her continued expectations from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine tells a few jokes and does a little comedy routine about the tabloids; 
the humor is on the level of an off night at "The Tonight Show," except there's 
no Johnny Carson to comment on how bad the material is. Buz Kohan Jr. wrote the 
script, as well as the lyrics for Larry Grossman's songs. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1984 show, MacLaine repeats her bit about her movie roles as hookers 
and adds a few lines from her recent "Steel Magnolias." She reruns her 1984 
tribute to choreographers, in which she dances "Sweet Georgia Brown" in the 
styles of Bob Fosse, Michael Kidd and this show's Alan Johnson, but she adds an 
MTV bit, for which she dons a pink wig and black, chain-studded clothes. Cute. 
</P>
<P>
She grimaced at one point during the Kidd number and pretended to stumble her 
way through the rest of it. Did she momentarily want us to worry that her knee 
had again given out? Or has her injury really limited her ability to go the 
distance on such a number, and this seemed the best way to cover it up? The 
intent was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine makes mild fun of her New Age image, but this too seems self-obsessed. 
True, the solipsism is temporarily suspended with an introduction of the band 
and chorus members that's generous to a fault (it eats up time at what should 
be the climax of the show and might better be done during the curtain call). We 
get to applaud each of the 11 talented onstage people who help Shirley do her 
show, as well as the star herself. But when the show is this thin, the applause 
sounds hollow.

STILL WAITING FOR 'GODOT'S' BIG LAUGHS AT OCC;

The electronic billboard at Orange Coast College touts "Waiting for Godot" this 
way: "Humor! Comedy! Ha! -- Ha! -- Ha!" Maybe they should have added, "By Sammy 
Beckett, that gagster of ennui! That joker of Angst!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, folks, "Waiting for Godot" isn't really that big a hoot. Let's call it a 
"tragicomedy," with alienation and desperation as the twin punch lines. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard is misleading in another way too. 
</P>
<P>
Director Glendele Way, to her credit, approaches Samuel Beckett's obtuse and 
difficult theater-of-the-absurd classic fairly straight. Her actors do goof off 
every now and then, and there are some pratfalls, but this is essentially a 
serious effort. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean it's good, though. For one thing, "Godot" is a play that 
welcomes a measure of comic invention; in fact, that may be the only way to 
make it accessible. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Steve Martin-Robin Williams' collaboration last year in New 
York had the crowds smiling and thinking at the same time, according to the 
critics in their many raves. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Orange Coast College Repertory Theatre Company's production 
lacks the sort of peak invention that can give "Godot" resonance. When Way does 
turn to humor, it's mainly silly stuff that doesn't underscore the existential 
dread at work. We get extraneous asides, like Vladimir (Russell Dunn) and 
Estragon (Gil Fuhrer), the play's hopeless, hapless heroes, high-fiving during 
one of their brief moments of shared joy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, "Godot" is quite a challenge for a college troupe, especially the 
actors -- they've got to fill in where Beckett doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
The play has left a wake of confounded theatergoers since first opening in New 
York in 1956, and even the best casts have been stumped by Vladimir and 
Estragon and their endless waiting for the anonymous Godot who never does show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
(Bert Lahr, who played Estragon during the premier run, supposedly didn't have 
a clue to what was going on. No problem -- both audiences and reviewers loved 
his befuddled, anxious performance, which says something about the nature of 
"Godot" itself.) 
</P>
<P>
At OCC, Fuhrer and Dunn give it the old college try but don't explore their 
characters enough. They get disturbed and worried and nervous, but it all 
should be less mannered and more evocative. 
</P>
<P>
Fuhrer and Dunn do have one thing in common with Lahr, though: The crowd at 
Friday's opening night performance apparently liked what the actors were doing, 
even if they may not have always got it. 
</P>
<P>

'Footsteps' Walks: "Pisadas en la Obscuridad (Footsteps in the Dark)," director 
Reza Abdoh's late-night festival entry, has at last found a home after losing 
its original downtown venue, Jack's Placita, last week. The show, which mixes 
elements of mystery-revenge and popular Mexican telenovelas, will now appear at 
the Park Plaza Hotel. Performance times (Sept. 6-9 at 10:30 p.m.) have not 
changed. BETH KLEID

The historic Santora Building in Santa Ana reopens Sept. 6 with a public 
celebration from 4 to 7 p.m. The 1929 Spanish-style building at Broadway and 
2nd Street, designed by architect Frank Lansdowne, once housed a jazz club, 
retail businesses and Daniger's Tea Room, a popular gathering spot for 
Hollywood actors and others during the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
The event, hosted by the Orange County Conservancy (a new committee of the 
Orange County Historical Society), the City of Santa Ana and Santora Partners 
of Upland (owners of the building), will include speeches -- by Mayor Daniel 
Young and representatives of the historical society, Santa Ana Downtown 
Business Assn., Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce and Santora Partners -- as well 
as refreshments, a showing of vintage Packard automobiles and music by Gisele 
Clair and Douglas Hein of Ah, Sweet Melody. 
</P>
<P>
Maps of the building -- which now houses retail and office space -- will be 
available for self-guided tours, and mini-buses will offer tours of historic 
downtown Santa Ana. Parking will be free. Information: (714) 557-7074.

ELLIOTT-INGRAM LOOKS FOR SENSE OF IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big jazz bands are a rare breed these days, sustained for the most part by the 
dedication of musicians willing to work free rehearsals and low-paying gigs. 
Groups like the Elliott-Ingram Band, which appeared at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill 
Monday night with saxophonist Gary Foster as guest soloist, illustrate both the 
promises and the problems of this approach. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble has been in existence for about 2 1/2 years, led by saxophonist 
Steve Elliott and trumpeter Roger Ingram. Typically, on this night Ingram was 
absent, on the road with a different group. The other musicians were a mixture 
of veterans and rookies, with a few former Woody Herman sidemen making up the 
band's nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
The collective playing was good, but not outstanding; the arrangements were 
well crafted, but fairly predictable; and the solos ranged from fair to 
excellent. Pieces like "Limehouse Blues," "My Foolish Heart" and "Gal in 
Calico" peaked when soloists like Brian Scanlon on alto saxophone, Mark Lewis 
on trumpet, Scott Tibbs on piano and Jerry Pinter on tenor saxophone made the 
most of their relatively short solo space. 
</P>
<P>
What was missing was a sense of identity -- a sound and substance to 
distinguish the Elliott-Ingram band from the numerous other groups with 
similarly limited opportunities to grow into unique musical entities. The 
showcasing of Foster on a few numbers provided a much-needed infusion of 
character. His playing, as always, included several superbly illuminating 
readings of standards like "You Go to My Head" and "You Don't Know What Love 
Is." Foster has taken the Lee Konitz-like mannerisms of his earliest work and 
synthesized them into a genuinely original, always communicative 
improvisational style. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Foster's participation, the Elliott-Ingram congregation never 
quite found a voice of its own. More rehearsals and better charts would make a 
difference, but the most elusive missing element -- and one that is essential 
to all successful big bands -- was a self-generating energy-driven inner 
spirit. DON HECKMAN

SUMMER JOBS IN TV REWARD YOUTHS FOR BEING DRUG-FREE; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNSHIPS: FIVE TEEN-AGERS WERE PAID $10 AN HOUR TO WORK IN A TELEVISION 
PRODUCTION OFFICE. THEY WERE SELECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE DARE 
ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM.

SUMMER HELP WANTED: Papazian/Hirsch Entertainment seeks five teen-agers to work 
at production company office and on the set of TV series. Learn about show-biz 
while earning $10 an hour. Car and driver included. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, these jobs were for real. And five very real teen-agers who spent the 
summer in them did not get hired because mommy is a director or daddy's a 
casting agent. 
</P>
<P>
In looking for summer interns without connections -- either within the industry 
or on the street -- producers Robert Papazian and Jim Hirsch had a definite 
point in mind: to reward ordinary teen-agers who have made an extraordinary 
commitment to live and espouse a drug-free lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"We created the internships as a way of saying to kids there's an incentive out 
there for you," Hirsch said. "You can teach a kid in school. . . . We added 
something to that, a preview of the real world, and in this case a world that's 
attractive to them." 
</P>
<P>
To find their interns, the producers teamed up with the Los Angeles Police 
Department-Los Angeles Unified School District drug education program, DARE. 
All of the students selected are veterans of the DARE programs who have 
remained active during junior and senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The producers and the police hope this prototype will spawn a citywide 
corporate effort to show teens who have taken a stance for sobriety that it was 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an instant winner," said LAPD Cmdr. Mike Bostic. "It's corporate America 
standing up and recognizing hard-working kids. 
</P>
<P>
The summer was definitely a winner for the five students, who were shown all 
facets of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Duties included calling to inquire about a $500,000 bill received by the 
company, going on location and working in post-production labs. They also 
attended casting sessions, answered phones, delivered messages and made endless 
photocopies, earning $3,200 for their eight weeks of work. A driver they now 
call "Daddy Vince" squired them to and from the set and around town in a big 
station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Venice High School student Joann Payumo said she relished telling her peers 
about her job. And when they ask how she got it, she is only too happy to 
answer: "Because I don't drink and I don't do drugs. No one has every heard of 
a 16-year-old making $10 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Payumo, 16, a Venice resident who was born in the Philippines, is thinking 
about becoming an accountant. She attributes her resolve about drugs to 
watching her brothers drink too much, and she says she received her strength of 
character from her architect mother, who died six years ago. "I do it all for 
her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other four interns also attend Venice High School. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Aviles, 16, a native of El Salvador, lives with his mother, who is a 
seamstress, and his sisters in the Crenshaw-Wilshire area. He is studying 
French at the Venice Foreign Language and International Studies magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ter-Minasyan, 16, comes to Venice High from Hollywood, where she and her 
mother live in a neighborhood populated with many Russian-Armenian immigrants. 
Her father died just before they emigrated from the Soviet Union a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lynette Walker, 17, is a student at Manual Arts High School who also credits 
her mother for keeping her on the straight and narrow about drugs. She is the 
only one of the five who is currently contemplating a career in the 
entertainment industry, unless she decides to be a computer engineer or 
scientist instead. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Szabo, 16, from James Monroe High School in the San Fernando Valley, 
lives with her parents in Northridge and is socking away her summer earnings 
for college. 
</P>
<P>
Although all five say they are good students, academic brilliance was not a 
prerequisite for selection. Neither were sports prowess or being a campus 
superstar. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the producers said they were looking for good kids who were 
quietly doing the right thing and who might not otherwise receive short-term 
rewards for their choices. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said he and his partner were looking for young people with an "I'm going 
to take my life and make the best out of it" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning on the set at the Papazian/Hirsch Entertainment office in 
Sun Valley, Payumo and Ter-Minasyan got the chance they had waited for all 
summer: to go before the cameras as extras. The scene was shot in one of the 
production offices decorated to look like a police squad room. 
</P>
<P>
The production boards note that this will be episode six of "Shades of L.A.," a 
series that will be shown on Channel 13 beginning sometime this fall. The show 
is about a detective who, after a near-death experience, is visited by ghosts 
from the beyond that help him close the books on unsolved crimes. 
</P>
<P>
John DiAquino, the actor who plays the detective, is seated at a computer and 
rehearsing a scene in which he retrieves data from a computer and talks on the 
phone. A crew member seated off camera reads the other half of the conversation 
from a script. 
</P>
<P>
The room is crowded with the small army of people who make television happen, 
including the director and the sound person and, today, two teen-agers being 
coached when to stroll into the scene while looking normal as they do something 
abnormal -- office work at a police station. 
</P>
<P>
None of their other assignments are this glamorous. Outside the closed door, 
Walker sits with a walkie-talkie in her lap. Her job is the make sure that no 
one bursts in while the cameras are rolling. 
</P>
<P>
In a nearby office, Aviles is collating call sheets, the daily schedules that 
tell everyone who's supposed to be on the set, when and why. He is conversant 
with all the production lingo and adroitly explains the various abbreviations. 
</P>
<P>
Another regular spot for an intern is at the air conditioning switch, which 
must be off during filming because of the noise and on immediately afterward 
because the hot lights quickly turn the set into a sauna. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo, the fifth trainee, is back at the corporate office in Westwood, where 
she prefers to be because she said she finds the filming process tedious. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the youths what they have learned this summer, and they will launch into a 
discourse on the importance of being polite on the phones. They learned this in 
a telephone training class and by trial-and-error. 
</P>
<P>
Their teacher, who coordinated the program, was Karen Morris. Morris, executive 
assistant to the producers, said the five were eager to learn and managed to 
maintain their nonchalance when actors they recognized came to the office to 
read for parts. 
</P>
<P>
"They think we're extravagant with food," Morris said. "Their first time on the 
set, they ate like truck drivers."

<P>
MALIBU: THE VILLA THAT HOUSES THE J. PAUL GETTY MUSEUM IS SURROUNDED BY 
CLASSICAL GARDENS OF PLANTS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE GROWN IN IMPERIAL ROME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Michael DeHart oversees the irises at the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Not Van Gogh's famous painted ones that hang inside, but the splendid living 
ones that grow in three of its five Roman-style gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The late oil tycoon hated the modern concrete-bunker school of museum 
architecture. Instead, he decided to build a Roman-style villa based on a real 
villa that was buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79, to house his 
collections. From the beginning, plants that might actually have grown by the 
sea in Imperial Rome were part of Getty's eccentric grand plan for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Like its classical model, the Getty has its topiarii, as the Romans called 
their master gardeners, to nurture its plants. But Getty gardeners have 
concerns their Roman counterparts never dreamed of, including making sure the 
plants are historically appropriate and saving water in a California drought. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, 29, is the museum's new horticulturist. A graduate of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, DeHart did a stint among the topiary Goofys and Snow Whites of Walt 
Disney World, installing plants for special events, before he arrived at the 
Getty in April. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Brentwood, DeHart arrives at the Getty every weekday morning at 
7. His first duty is to walk all five of the gardens, clippers and notebook at 
the ready, scrutinizing the evergreens, flowers and other plants for evidence 
of droop, trampling and other vegetative crises. Hundreds of species of plants 
grow on the 60-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman-style garden is feasible in Malibu because the climate is so similar to 
that of the Italian coast. Herculaneum, where the model for the museum, Villa 
dei Papiri, stood, was even earthquake-prone. Caesar would feel right at home 
with the olive and fig trees at the museum, the oleanders, bays and myrtles, 
the beds of sweet mint and sharp-scented rosemary. There are also pink damask 
roses, one of DeHart's favorites, despite their tendency to develop powdery 
mildew in the damp air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about as fragrant as any rose I've ever smelled," he says. "It's a rose 
the way roses were before they were played with." 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting his charges, DeHart alerts the gardening staff of 15 (11 in 
winter) to any horticultural emergencies. He reduces the complex tasks of 
keeping a world-class garden lovely year-round to a series of work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, who has loved horticulture since he tended African violets and worked 
the family kitchen garden as a child, says there are multiple satisfactions to 
the job. There are the sensual pleasures of working in a beautiful place by the 
sea. There is the joy of problem-solving, experienced recently when he found a 
safe pesticide to zap the white fly that has been plaguing the pomegranates. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the satisfaction of grappling with concerns unique to horticulture 
at the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Take the irises. Most of the irises in the museum's main peristyle garden (the 
large rectangular area that runs forward toward the ocean from the display 
galleries) are what DeHart calls "Van Gogh blue." They are both the shade of 
the flowers in the museum's most famous acquisition -- "Irises" -- and the 
color of the species form of the plant, which the ancients knew and named after 
the goddess of the rainbow. But the garden also has burgundy-colored irises, a 
modern variety developed after 1800. The red irises are lovely, but as 
anachronistic in the classical Getty gardens as a digital alarm clock. They are 
slated for removal. 
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the gardens is important to the Getty, which is why there 
is no bougainvillea despite the fact that it thrives both in Southern 
California and modern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens are more than a setting for the Getty's antiquities. They are a 
context, and the staff labors to make them as accurate in their own way as the 
museum's display signs. The catch is that no one now knows exactly what a Roman 
garden was like, although there are clues in ancient frescoes, classical 
writings and archeological remains. Dennis Kurutz, a Pasadena landscape 
architect who designed the gardens in the early 1970s and now serves as a 
consultant to the museum, says the accuracy of the plantings are an ongoing 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
He cites the main peristyle garden as an example. Based on his research, he 
says, "I made the assumption that Roman gardens would have been very structured 
and ordered." As a result, the peristyle garden has symmetrical rows of bay 
laurel trees that might have been cloned and carefully balanced boxwood hedges 
on either side of the central pool. The effect is a little static for Kurutz's 
own taste, he says, but it reflects his best historical guess at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's learned from archeologists that the Romans included impulsive 
touches in their gardens, not unlike modern gardeners who fall in love at the 
nursery Sunday afternoon and have to have some pretty plant, symmetry be 
damned. "Those gardens wouldn't have been quite as structured as that," says 
Kurutz, who is exploring ways to add calculated spontaneity to the peristyle 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Other refinements are under consideration. Roman gardeners liked to train and 
trim plants into artificial shapes, called topiary. They would sometimes spell 
out their names in boxwood hedges -- a kind of living graffiti -- and they 
recreated battle scenes and chariot races in their greenery. The Getty decided 
to stick with simple geometric topiary when the gardens were installed, Kurutz 
says, in part because Getty was still alive and had given no indication that he 
was going to endow the institution as lavishly as he did. But now more more 
ambitious topiary shapes, lions perhaps, could be phased in. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy doesn't always triumph, even at the Getty. Paths that would have been 
simply packed dirt in ancient times were paved to protect museum objects from 
dust. And Kurutz had hoped to see the villa surrounded with Roman-style 
meadows, not the lawns, as manicured as golf courses, that now exist. He even 
specified appropriate plants for the meadows, including that old Roman 
favorite, the dandelion. Ironically, he says, the public has complained 
whenever the museum has experimented with letting an area get authentically 
scruffy, often with barbed remarks about the institution's having enough money 
to mow the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity is always on DeHart's mind, as he circumambulates the gardens. In 
choosing plants, he says, he asks himself three questions: Is it Roman, when 
does it bloom and how thirsty is it? Knowing a plant's blooming cycle is key to 
keeping the gardens perennially attractive. And drought resistance is both a 
horticultural and a social issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, the museum called for a cutback on water use. DeHart was asked 
to trim 10%. By cutting back just over 20% on water for hillsides and other 
non-museum areas, he has enough to keep the five museum gardens, which are 
hand-watered, looking their best. Whenever possible, he says, plants such as 
pearlwort that need a lot of water are being replaced with equally authentic 
plants that are drought resistant, such as lamb's ears. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's potted plants are also getting by with less since a special 
water-retaining polymer was mixed with the soil in the containers. 
</P>
<P>
Propagation of plants is one of DeHart's most important duties, not only to 
save money but because many of the varieties are not readily available in this 
country. DeHart says he had never even seen a medlar -- a small tree that 
produces bitter, apple-like fruit -- until he arrived at the Getty. After the 
museum's two medlars finish fruiting, he'll take tip cuttings in hopes of 
multiplying them. 
</P>
<P>
Modern scientific horticulture is only part of the picture for DeHart. In the 
half-ancient world in which he gardens, plants are one of life's essential 
mysteries, food for the stomach, the eye and the mind. Old beliefs live on, 
particularly in the herb garden, a favorite with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs had religious significance for the Greeks and Romans and were also valued 
as cures. Garlic, for instance, was thought to be an aphrodisiac and to ward 
off snakes. Richard Naranjo, head of grounds at the Getty, was born in Mexico, 
where his mother treated his childhood earaches in a manner the Romans would 
have approved of, with rue. "She'd crush it and mix it with olive oil and put 
it in our ears on a piece of cotton," he says. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart's grandmother in Pennsylvania Amish country made comfrey and borage teas 
for colds. "She also gave us baby aspirins," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The staff are allowed to do some restrained harvesting in the herb garden. 
"They keep the basil in check," says DeHart, who is brought the occasional gift 
of pesto by a grateful colleague. Getty-raised dill sometimes appears in dishes 
served in the museum tea room. DeHart has been known to bring dill home to 
season stir-fry vegetables and sprinkle over salmon.

<P>
There are moments on the job, DeHart says, when the classical world seems more 
real to him than Southern California, with its smog, traffic and other 
not-so-civilized discontents. You can sometimes time-travel through the 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"At 7 o'clock in the morning, when no one is here and there's nothing to 
distract me, it's easy to think of what this must have been like when slaves 
were doing this work and there was just one family living here -- one very rich 
family."

DEAL MAKERS HUDDLE TO SALVAGE DEVELOPMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
CULVER CITY: AT STAKE ARE THE CONTROVERSIAL MARINA PLACE MALL AND THE CHANNEL 
GATEWAY RESIDENTIAL AND OFFICE PROJECT. THEY ARE WORTH HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A back-room deal is in the works to settle a bitter border battle between 
Culver City and Los Angeles that has threatened to stop the massive Marina 
Place shopping mall and the Channel Gateway developments dead in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the border fight is more than half a billion dollars worth of real 
estate development that could transform the look and feel of Venice 
neighborhoods and worsen traffic on congested Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The package deal, being negotiated out of public view by developers of both 
projects and representatives of both cities, is aimed at avoiding a courtroom 
confrontation that could tie up the two developments for years. 
</P>
<P>
According to a typewritten outline of the possible settlement, it would provide 
for developers of the $160-million Marina Place mall, proposed for a site at 
Culver City's western tip, to eliminate a traffic-generating six-screen theater 
complex, to reduce the number of liquor licenses, to pay for additional street 
and traffic signal improvements, and to finance a beach shuttle to reduce 
prospects for gridlock on neighboring streets. 
</P>
<P>
But none of those concessions would take place unless the city of Los Angeles 
agrees to to drop a lawsuit against the shopping center project and Culver City 
promises not to file suit against the $400-million Channel Gateway residential 
and office project. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement talks, which negotiators say are not final, dramatically 
illustrate the steadfast determination of developers to move ahead with their 
projects before the remaining traffic capacity in the Venice-Marina del Rey 
area is used up. 
</P>
<P>
One important player was apparently not a party to the negotiations: Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the Los Angeles 
neighborhoods that virtually surround the Marina Place site and whose strident 
opposition to the 1-million-square-foot project prompted Los Angeles' decision 
to file suit to block its construction. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said in an interview Wednesday that the outline of a settlement is 
unacceptable to her. 
</P>
<P>
"A regional shopping center is not what the Westside needs, particularly close 
to Lincoln Boulevard and to the beach," Galanter said. "It's the wrong land use 
in the wrong place. . . . I think it's a bad idea and will continue to object 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
Although she is a strong supporter of the Channel Gateway project and a key 
participant in winning its approval at the city and state levels, Galanter 
claimed not to know that settlement talks were under way between the developers 
and the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Galanter said she had not seen the outline of the settlement until she 
was given a copy Tuesday by Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
The push for negotiations came from politically well-connected Los Angeles 
developer Jerome Snyder, whose Channel Gateway project was likely to become the 
next pawn in the chess match between cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I put this package together and I negotiated it," Snyder said in a telephone 
interview Wednesday while on vacation in France. 
</P>
<P>
Although delays are costly on any large project, Snyder said he feels added 
urgency with respect to Channel Gateway because the project is designed to 
contain 544 apartment units financed by $67 million in tax-exempt bonds. The 
bond financing, made available because Snyder has agreed to set aside 20% of 
the apartments for rental to low-income tenants, is contingent on the 
apartments being completed by August, 1992, a deadline that would be all but 
impossible to meet if Culver City sues to block the project. 
</P>
<P>
Only days after the California Coastal Commission granted final approval of the 
project earlier this month, bulldozers and earthmovers began working to ready 
the 16-acre site on Lincoln Boulevard for construction crews. In addition to 
the apartments, the development at the western end of the Marina Expressway 
also includes 512 luxury condominiums in two 16-story high-rises, a 
300,000-square-foot office tower and parking for 3,460 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he began searching for a solution to the legal brinkmanship after a 
meeting in June in Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's office in which Culver City 
Councilman Paul Jacobs warned that Channel Gateway would be held hostage if Los 
Angeles failed to drop its lawsuit against Marina Place. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Snyder said he has been working behind the scenes, talking to Los 
Angeles and Culver City officials, and representatives of Melvin Simon &amp; 
Associates, who are the developers of the Marina Place project along with the 
Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Snyder said it was Galanter who provided the framework of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"All the objections to the project, I heard from her, chapter and verse -- the 
theaters, traffic mitigation, liquor licenses, the height of the buildings," 
Snyder said. "She also complained to me that they were not doing anything for 
low-cost housing." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he took Galanter's objections to Melvin Simon. He recalled that 
Simon's representatives asked him, "What the hell can we do to get this crazy 
woman off our back?" Snyder said he replied, "Try being a goddamn responsible 
developer." 
</P>
<P>
Although his account of the wording of the conversation differed, Barry 
Lindsey, senior vice president of Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, confirmed 
Wednesday that the agreement is "something we worked out jointly with Jerry 
Snyder." 
</P>
<P>
In accord with Galanter's demands, the draft calls for major changes in Marina 
Place: eliminating the movie theaters entirely, reducing to 12 from 16 the 
number of liquor licenses and spending an additional $1 million in improvements 
to ease traffic congestion, including the establishment of a shuttle bus for 
use in the Venice and Marina del Rey areas. The pact also includes $210,000 to 
landscape Venice and Washington boulevards from Lincoln Boulevard to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's what it's going to take, we can take that sacrifice," Lindsey said. 
"We have an investment in a piece of property. We're not going to go away. . . 
. We would like to start building." 
</P>
<P>
Both Snyder and Lindsey say they do not know where the deal stands, but they 
indicated that the disclosure of the proposed terms this week through 
distribution of the typewritten outline had muddied the picture considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he wants Bradley -- who earlier this year took part in a protest 
demonstration at the Marina Place site -- to take the lead on settling the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I wanted to see the mayor carry," Snyder said. "I've kept 
him abreast of what's going on from the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bradley said Wednesday that the mayor has not endorsed the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, Galanter's support is deemed crucial. Snyder said he doubts that the 
Los Angeles City Council would "overrule Ruth in her own district." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he "kept her out of it" during the negotiations "so she could say 
she didn't know anything about it. . . . I didn't want her to be in the middle 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
He said his hope is to "get her on board by getting her constituents to agree 
it's a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern in this regard is a group of Venice community activists 
who have filed their own suit against Marina Place. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Bowen, attorney for the community group, expressed little enthusiasm for 
the proposed compromise in an interview this week. If anything, she said, the 
private deal will probably stiffen the Venice community's resolve to fight the 
shopping mall in their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It will generate a tremendous amount of anger, and people tend to act when 
they are angry," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Intense development pressure along Lincoln Boulevard near Marina del Rey has 
sparked a race between Los Angeles and Culver City to approve large-scale 
projects in the congested area before the boulevard's remaining capacity to 
handle traffic there is gone. When Culver City approved plans early this year 
for Marina Place, a large shopping mall at the city's western tip that 
threatened to inundate adjoining neighborhoods with traffic and air pollution, 
Los Angeles sued to stop construction. In retaliation, Culver City has 
threatened a suit to stymie Channel Gateway, a major high-rise development 
three blocks away. Faced with the prospect of legal gridlock that could hold up 
both projects for years, the developers are trying to negotiate a compromise.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;

<P>
NO ON AIR AMBULANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hearing examiner has recommended that Los Angeles city officials reject a bid 
by the Fire Department to operate a 24-hour air-ambulance service from a ridge 
above the Hollywood sign in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the city Planning Commission, hearing examiner Charles Rausch on 
Tuesday recommended that the department's request for a permit be denied until 
a study is conducted to determine the effect of helicopter noise on nearby 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission will consider the report Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, who respond to air-ambulance calls from Van Nuys Airport, want 
to operate a permanent, centrally located heliport at Mt. Lee that would serve 
the entire city. Many Hollywood Hills residents, however, have complained that 
noise from the operation would be intolerable and have urged the department to 
find a location away from residential neighborhoods.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
FASTER CITYHOOD APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cityhood group has asked the California Supreme Court to expedite its appeal 
of a lower court ruling that upheld Los Angeles County's authority to delay the 
community's incorporation until next March. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers appealed to the Supreme Court after a Court of Appeal ruled in 
the county's favor in July. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jeff Kramer, a lawyer for the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, said 
the latest request was warranted because of the haste with which the county is 
seeking to start construction of a $43-million sewer system in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a measure that would nullify the county's delay of Malibu's 
incorporation, which swept through both houses of the state Legislature last 
week, awaits action by Gov. George Deukmejian. County officials are urging the 
governor to veto the bill and have indicated that, if he signs it, they still 
plan to try to stall cityhood long enough to begin work on the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), was approved 29 to 0 
in the Senate and 71 to 0 in the Assembly. By law, the governor has 12 days 
from last Friday, when the bill reached his desk, to act on it. Observers have 
speculated that if there is a veto, it will come next week, after the 
Legislature has adjourned, to avoid a possible override.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;

<P>
EFFORT TO BAR POKER CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A broad coalition of civic leaders in West Hollywood has formed a campaign 
committee to defeat Proposition AA on the November ballot -- the measure that 
would allow a large card casino to be built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, Residents Against the West Hollywood Poker Casino, includes all 
five City Council members, gay community activists, homeowners association 
officials and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition is the only ballot measure in West Hollywood on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the gambling club contend that it could generate between $5 
million and $10 million annually for the city, roughly 10% of the club's 
estimated gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
To make the measure more appealing to the city's 20,000 registered voter, the 
initiative requires the city to earmark three-fourths of its revenues for the 
elderly, increased law enforcement, gay and lesbian services and the 
revitalization of the city's east end, where the club would be located. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure say the casino is out of place and far out of scale 
for West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary concern is preserving our special quality of life," Mayor John 
Heilman said in a prepared statement. "No matter where a 200-table casino would 
be built, the impact would be felt throughout our tiny community."

PARKS, COLLEGE OFFICIALS TANGLE OVER CAMPUS SITE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: CAMPUS OFFICIALS AREN'T BUYING A LAND-SWAP PROPOSAL TO TURN THEIR 
ACREAGE INTO THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS PARK HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Calabasas land occupied by the campus of Japan-based Soka University has 
long been coveted by the national parks system for use as the headquarters and 
visitor center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, state and federal park officials in June had arranged a meeting with 
university officials for last Sunday, so they could discuss their interest in 
acquiring the school's 248 acres off Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But the parks officials were shocked last week when the university announced 
that it had more than doubled the size of its campus with the purchase of 332 
additional acres of land in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
They had been alarmed since April when Soka officials said they planned to 
increase the scope of its operations over the next 25 years from a 80-student 
language institute to a 5,000-student liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
The parks authorities said they had been assured by Soka officials during 
further talks at the end of June that no more land was being sought for the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised and aghast," said David Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which stretches from the Pacific 
Ocean to the Golden State Freeway and includes the Soka property. The parks 
officials have expressed interest in the original campus site because of its 
buildings and its geographic access to various trails and the recreation area's 
maintenance yards. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting on Sunday went ahead as planned, although the topic of discussion 
had been changed. Instead of acquisition, state and federal officials took the 
opportunity to propose a land exchange with the university. 
</P>
<P>
A top university administrator said he would convey the proposal to his board 
of directors but expressed opposition because the American officials had no 
specific site to trade, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was presented at a meeting between Soka University officials and 
Gackenbach; Joseph Edmiston, director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, and Dan Preece, district superintendent of the state park system. 
</P>
<P>
Campus spokesman Jeff Ourvan said Soka University administrators had hoped that 
buying the additional acreage would address environmental concerns by allowing 
the college to spread out and leave large swaths of land undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
He also said campus officials' memory of the June 28 meeting differed from that 
of the parks officials. "They carefully recollected that no such commitment was 
made," he said referring to the purchase of additional land. 
</P>
<P>
The April announcement of the plans to expand from a short-term 
English-language training institute to a four-year liberal arts college also 
prompted angry reactions from state and federal parks officials. 
</P>
<P>
From the park perspective, adding more land is no improvement, said Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
"That would just mean more land in between the buildings for lawns or Japanese 
gardens or something. . . . We're talking about a park to be open to the 
public," he said. "And the impact of 5,000 students on Mulholland Highway and 
Las Virgenes Road is still going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the April expansion announcement, parks officials said they 
would do everything they could to preserve the land, including condemning it if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Condemnation is a court procedure used by public agencies when sellers are 
unwilling to give up their land, under which a judge mandates a purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The land swap, if approved, would avoid such action. 
</P>
<P>
Ourvan said Hiroshi Okayasu, Soka's general director and second only to its 
president, reacted skeptically to the land-swap idea because of the "inability 
of Mr. Gackenbach to submit any concrete proposal." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a clue as to any specific idea or land and in fact we'd be very 
surprised if Mr. Gackenbach could come up with a piece of property as ideal for 
our purposes as this one," Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was unlikely Okayasu would have an official response for another two 
to three months, when his next trip to the United States is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Ourvan said, the university will discuss its long-range plans 
with neighbors. He said Soka had no immediate plans to submit development 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can find a better spot, we'd be open to that, sure," Ourvan said of 
the proposed land exchange. But he also said the university considered its 
Calabasas location ideal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of money to us but a question of value, and we feel this 
site is very valuable to us for its beauty and our vision of establishing a 
university that is both academically functional and environmentally sensitive," 
Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
But the spot is also ideally suited as a focal point for the park system, 
Edmiston said of the mountain conservancy. It is not only scenic, Edmiston 
said, but located midway between the Pacific Coast Highway and the Ventura 
Freeway, and would afford both seasoned hikers and casual picnickers easy 
access to the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The national recreation area has no visitors center, which makes it difficult 
to attract the public into the mountains. Edmiston said most visitors use only 
the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said parks officials had no other piece of land in mind to offer Soka 
University. But he said if university administrators were amenable to the idea, 
"we will take their criteria and hire a consultant and do as exhaustive a 
search as possible" to find the best site for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston and Ourvan described Sunday's meeting as cordial. It lasted about 90 
minutes, mostly consumed by language interpreters for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The national park system has been interested in the Soka site for 12 years, 
Gackenbach has said. The park service tried to buy the land in 1986 but lost to 
Soka University, which purchased it for $15.5 million from the Church Universal 
and Triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said one advantage to purchasing land elsewhere and trading it for the 
Soka site was that the cost could be more affordable to the park service. 
</P>
<P>
An appraisal of the original 248 acres is under way.

THIGPEN IS CLOSING IN ON RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S ONLY THREE SAVES AWAY FROM RIGHETTI'S MARK

<P>
Bobby Thigpen doesn't stomp around the mound like Al Hrabosky, or glare down at 
hitters like Goose Gossage. Never will the Chicago White Sox right-hander be 
seen pumping his fist and exhorting the crowd, like Tug McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many renowned relievers, Thigpen has no gimmicks, no act, just a darting 
fastball, a nasty slider and an outstanding changeup that have brought him 
within three saves of the major league record of 46 set in 1986 by Dave 
Righetti of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I don't intimidate anybody with my looks, like Hrabosky or Gossage, 
and I don't have Lee Smith's physique. Tom Henke is another guy like that," 
said Thigpen, a lean and clean-cut, 6-foot-3, 195-pounder who would be dwarfed 
by the Cardinals' 6-6, 250-pound Smith or Toronto's 6-5, 225-pound Henke. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time guys like Smith and Henke release the ball, they've cut six to 
eight feet off the distance to the hitter. I just go out and try to do my job 
without having to resort to any of that. If I can make the pitches I'm supposed 
to make, whatever Carlton (Fisk) or Karko (Ron Karkovice) put down, I'll be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Floridian is having his best season, keeping the White Sox in 
the American League West race as he chases Righetti's save record. 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen, whose 34 saves in 1989 were second in the AL to the 38 recorded by 
Jeff Russell of Texas, got his 40th save this season on Aug. 19, the earliest 
any reliever reached that mark. He earned No. 40 in Chicago's 118th game, 23 
games -- and 21 days -- earlier than Bruce Sutter picked up his 40th with the 
St. Louis Cardinals in 1984, when Sutter recorded 45 saves. When Righetti set 
the record, he earned his 40th save on Sept. 15. Righetti set his record in 76 
appearances, 68 of which he finished; Thigpen has finished 57 of the 61 games 
he has entered. 
</P>
<P>
"The record and all those numbers mean nothing to me," Thigpen said. "If we win 
every game from here on out by four runs and I end the season with (43), that 
would be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen is the leader of a relief corps composed of left-handers Ken Patterson 
and Scott Radinsky -- whose four saves rank him second on the club -- and 
right-handers Barry Jones, Donn Pall and Adam Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do get the record, unless it's the last game of the season, I don't think 
I'll really appreciate it until the season's over and I have time to sit down 
and think back on it. I still have a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
And he's doing it quite well. 
</P>
<P>
In a 13-day span beginning on Aug. 13, Thigpen made eight appearances and 
earned five saves for 10 innings of work. He reduced his earned-run average to 
1.97 before being charged with two of the three runs driven in by Angel first 
baseman Lee Stevens Saturday, raising his ERA to 2.20. It was only the seventh 
time he failed to convert in 50 save opportunities. He leads the American 
League with his 61 appearances, covering 69 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy working," he said. "I pitched in four games in a row twice this year 
and I felt better in the fourth than the first. Say I have two or three days 
off. When I get out there again, I feel so strong physically, I tend to 
overthrow the ball, and my fastball straightens out. When I pitch a lot and I'm 
a little tired, I slow myself down mechanically and I let my arm do the work 
and I pitch better." 
</P>
<P>
He's pitching better because he's pitching more often, he believes, and he's 
pitching more often because the White Sox are still in a race no one expected 
them to be running. Chicago was 6 1/2 games behind the AL West-leading A's 
going into Wednesday's games. "To me, my stats are just a reflection of the 
team," Thigpen said. "The fact that we're in so many games means there's more 
chances for saves. Our style of play is another reason I get in so many games. 
We don't blow people out. Most games we win are going to be close. I'm not that 
much different a person or a pitcher than before. I have the slider, but I 
still get guys out with what I got them out with before. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year before this, I faltered in something, my ERA or something else 
because we weren't in a lot of games and I'd go in after not pitching for four 
or five days. I wouldn't go out with the same approach mentally and I'd give up 
four or five runs. This year, I've been trying to stay more focused and 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
The improvement of his slider, a pitch he used to throw only early in the 
count, has also been crucial to his success this season. Not only is it more 
effective, it also makes his dancing fastball -- which can reach 90 to 93 
m.p.h. -- even tougher to hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thrown it at 3 and 2, 2 and 1, whenever it's called for, and Carlton's 
not afraid to call it," Thigpen said. "I can throw it more consistently for 
strikes and I'm not just showing it to hitters. It's an out pitch for me." 
</P>
<P>
Almost every pitch seems like an out pitch for him this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been very successful with just his fastball for a couple of years, but 
last year he started plugging in his slider a little bit and he started working 
on his changeup in the pen," said White Sox bullpen coach Dave LaRoche, a 
reliever for most of his 14-year career, including three with the Angels. La 
Roche has the Angels' career save record with 65. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said, 'You have to have the slider,' but more like, 'Let's tinker with 
it. If a hitter gives you trouble, why not try it?' Now he's got confidence in 
all three pitches, although I think to most hitters in the league, if one pitch 
is going to make the difference in the game, (they) are still going to get the 
fastball. That's still his bread and butter." 
</P>
<P>
Said White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg, the Yankees' bullpen coach when Gossage 
pitched in New York: "He reminds me of Goose. I used to give Goose the ball 
just like you would feed an animal, just put it in my palm and let him grab it. 
All the good ones are the same with the stomach. When the (bullpen) phone 
rings, they want to go into the game." 
</P>
<P>
LaRoche also sees similarities between Thigpen and Gossage. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot like Goose in that he's laid-back and gentle, but once he gets to 
the mound he's mean," LaRoche said. "Goose had that Fu Manchu (mustache) and 
looked mean. Bobby gets revved up inside -- he just gives a normal appearance. 
. . . He has the perfect temperament for anything in life. He's laid-back and 
easygoing. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have a good time as much as anybody, but he doesn't get crazy and loud 
and he's not wild and flaky like the left-handers," said LaRoche, who serves as 
a sort of camp counselor to Chicago's young and talented relief corps. "He's 
perfect for me as a coach. I think the ace of your bullpen should set an 
example for everyone out there, and if I had to control him, I'd have to 
control the whole pen." 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen knows the A's control the AL West race. "They've proven they can win. 
We're unproven, and people are still learning what kind of team we're capable 
of having," Thigpen said. "We're confident in what we can do, even though it 
seems like everyone is waiting for us to crack, waiting for us to fold. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This year has been great. At this time last year, it still seemed like June, 
it was going so slow. This year is flying by. It's fun to come to the park. 
Guys are starting to understand what it is to win and getting the feeling of 
winning. It's a great attitude to have and it's great to get this type of 
experience. If we don't win it this year, I guarantee that next year, we'll be 
picked for second, not seventh, like we were before this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this isn't a dream season. Shoot, I'd like to do this again next year. 
I don't think this is a fluke, a fake. As young as we are, we can do this for a 
number of years and we should get even better."

GOMEZ JOINS U.S. OPEN'S CASUALTY LIST;

<P>
TENNIS: WITH EDBERG OUT, TOO, LENDL BECOMES THE ONLY ONE OF THIS YEAR'S MEN'S 
GRAND SLAM WINNERS TO ADVANCE. MCENROE WINS, BUT IS FINED $500.

<P>
So, Andres Gomez, you win the French Open, follow it up by losing in the first 
round of Wimbledon and then lose in the first round of the U.S. Open Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Are you disappointed or what? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, I am very happy," Gomez said, sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, one of the most agreeable players on the tour, was having a bad day. At 
first, he refused to be interviewed after the match, then relented and 
complained about the court on which he had played. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said he was distracted by fans walking behind the court, by people 
talking too loud and by the smoke blowing across the net from hamburgers and 
hot dogs being grilled at the concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, Gomez presumably loved the court. 
</P>
<P>
The day after Stefan Edberg, the reigning Wimbledon champion, lost in the first 
round, French Open champion Gomez did the same thing, crashing out at the hands 
of Luiz Mattar, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John McEnroe was fined $500 for knocking a hole in a courtside sign 
with his racket, but it didn't faze him much. McEnroe defeated David Engel of 
Sweden, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, McEnroe had sort of mixed results. He won his second-round match, 
but in addition to his fine, he also had a ball hit him near the eye when it 
glanced off his racket. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, it just gave me a bit of a spot," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to 18-year-old Goran Ivanisevic to put into perspective the 
first-round defeats of Edberg and Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's life, you know," Ivanisevic said. 
</P>
<P>
If it hadn't been for Ivan Lendl's 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Michael 
Stich, all three of the year's Grand Slam winners would have been gone already. 
Lendl, the Australian Open champion, avoided a sweep. And strangely, he 
credited his hat. 
</P>
<P>
He wore a hat with a flap in the back, resembling something from the French 
Foreign Legion. Lendl, who had two dozen of the white hats delivered Tuesday 
from Australia, believes they help him beat the heat. 
</P>
<P>
He claims that the hats, which keep the heat off the back of his neck, allow 
him to play 20% to 30% longer without getting tired. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Lendl likes his hat. "Even though it may look a little bit funny," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After playing just one other match in a tournament since Wimbledon, Lendl said 
he needed match play to be effective in the Open. He expects to reach his top 
level in a another match or two. 
</P>
<P>
And if he did manage to win his fourth U.S. Open, that could make him the top 
player of the year, Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not on the computer, but still the world champion, if either Gomez or I 
win," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was then informed that Gomez lost. 
</P>
<P>
"To whom?" 
</P>
<P>
Mattar, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess he won't win this one," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
The final Maleeva score was 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was the luck of the draw when sisters Katerina Maleeva, 21, and Magdalena 
Maleeva, 15, played each other in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Katerina won, 6-3, 6-1, but wasn't very happy about her victory, saying: "It 
doesn't bring any feelings to me." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manuela Maleeva Fragniere, the eldest of the three sisters at 23, 
won her second-round match against Debbie Graham of Fountain Valley, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-ranked Katerina and ninth-ranked Manuela try not to enter the same 
tournaments if they can, except for Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
All three Maleeva sisters are coached by their mother, Yulia. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, there is no rivalry between us," Katerina said. "I'm 
glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the only way Katerina could play Manuela is if they meet in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova, who has played seven U.S. Open finals and won four, 
overpowered Clare Wood, 6-0, 6-4, and advanced to the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said that after winning Wimbledon she doesn't feel any pressure, 
but she is feeling pressure. Got that? 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 14, 16 or 18 years old, you've got 20 U.S. Opens to go," 
Navratilova said. "I don't have that many. Every one could be my last. So 
that's pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I am truly thrilled I am in this position. At the beginning of the year, I 
thought I had a chance of becoming No. 1 (and) a lot of people thought I was 
Looney Tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm just tickled to death to be close. The pressure is there, but I don't 
mind it. That's what you live for as a tennis player."

GWYNN IS THE STAR THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: HE HITS TWO HOMERS, INCLUDING A GRAND SLAM, IN 12-2 VICTORY OVER 
PHILLIES AS REDS' LEAD IS CUT TO 5 1/2 GAMES. 
</P>

<P>
What began as an isolated pocket of resistance has become a full-scale 
uprising. Collecting hits that you can't even see from the bench, Dodger 
reserves are clamoring for respect, playing time, or at least a funny nickname. 
</P>
<P>
First it was Jose Gonzalez, who had the nerve to win a game against the New 
York Mets last Saturday with a 14th-inning home run. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Chris Gwynn, who, upon dusting himself off Wednesday night, hit his 
first career grand slam in his first two-homer game to lead the Dodgers to a 
12-2 victory. He had a solo shot in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers won the world championship in 1988, their successful bench 
players were known as the Stunt Men. Thus far this year, the reserves have been 
the stunted men. 
</P>
<P>
But Gwynn's fourth and fifth homers of the year showed that could change, as he 
helped the Dodgers move to within 5 1/2 games of the National League 
West-leading Cincinnati Reds, who lost to St. Louis, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third time in 11 days that the Dodgers have been this close to first 
place. They have not been closer since May 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about it all the time . . . this is getting fun, and we want to make a 
contribution," Gwynn said. "Nobody was happier than me to see Jose hit his home 
run. I mean, we spend a lot of time on the bench just looking at each other." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn earned most of the glances Wednesday on a night that lasted 4 hours 52 
minutes because of a lengthy rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
He was making just his third start since June 24, just his 14th start this 
season. Even then, he was only in the lineup because regular left-fielder Kal 
Daniels reported to the park with a sore back and because a right-hander, 
rookie Tommy Greene, was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know how that works, it's worked that way all year," said Gwynn, who 
showed how well he keeps any frustrations hidden by hitting his first-inning 
homer over the right-field fence against Greene. 
</P>
<P>
The hard part for him was two innings later, after Mike Scioscia's two-run 
homer gave the Dodgers a 3-0 edge. In the top of the third, with Gwynn batting, 
a rainstorm moved over the stadium and the game was delayed for 2:24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out Cincinnati had lost and we had this lead and I was just hoping 
everything wouldn't get washed out," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn said he remained fresh and inspired during the delay by watching Kevin 
Mitchell hit two home runs for the San Francisco Giants on television, and by 
drinking coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Four innings after the game resumed, Mitchell's influence worked even better 
than the caffeine as Gwynn hit a 1-and-0 pitch from Darrel Akerfelds over the 
right-field fence for a slam that highlighted an eight-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
"My first grand slam and the first two-homer game ever, even in little league, 
and I remember those things," said Gwynn, who entered the season homerless in 
111 career at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
His bat capped a 15-hit night for the offense against five Phillies pitchers 
and provided a safe cushion for Fernando Valenzuela, who allowed two runs in 
five innings to win his third consecutive start. 
</P>
<P>
"Those eight runs, that made it a lot better," said Valenzuela, who has allowed 
just six runs in his last 19 innings to improve to 12-10 while lowerin his 
earned-run average to 3.93. 
</P>
<P>
By throwing four scoreless innings, Tim Crews picked up his fifth save. 
Although by then, the Phillies had already been sufficiently demoralized by a 
man they never expected to even see. 
</P>
<P>
Not that manager Tom Lasorda doesn't know that Gwynn is around. 
</P>
<P>
"I have told him, 'Hey, I wish I could play you ever day,"' Lasorda said of 
Gwynn, who is batting .278. "And I mean that. I think if he played every day, 
he would do a good job. He is a good hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda shook his head and lowered his voice. "But you know I'm just not in a 
position to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, like Gonzalez, would like to start, and with good reason. In his 14 
starts this season, he is batting .327 with 11 RBIs and 12 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Gonzalez, who has twice asked to be traded, Gwynn no longer makes 
noise about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this year I was worrying and wondering about, but I have learned, all 
of that stuff makes no difference," Gwynn said. "All it does it makes you feel 
worse, and little else." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend Gonzalez said he did not expect to be playing with the Dodgers 
next year. On Wednesday, Gwynn differed about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless I'm traded, I guess I will be here," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
His grand slam in the sixth inning after two other part-time players came 
thrugh with big hits. Mickey Hatcher had a bases-loaded pinch single for one 
run, and Juan Samuel, also pinch-hitting, knocked a hard grounder that third 
baseman Charlie Hayes booted for another run. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels' back was still sore when he reported to Veterans' Stadium, so he 
was kept out of the lineup. Alfredo Griffin was returned to the lineup even 
though Jose Offerman singled, walked and scored the eventual winning run 
Tuesday. . . . During the rain delay, the Phillies announced that outfielder 
Len Dykstra signed a three-year contract with an option year that could keep 
him with the team through 1994. The conract guarantees him just over $7 million 
for three seasons, making him more than a $2-million-per-year player. Dysktra, 
who could have become a free agent after next season, entered Wednesday as the 
major league's leading hitter with a .340 average. "You are going to laugh at 
me when I say this," Dykstra said, "but I think that before my contract is up 
here, we could win the division. In fact, we will win the division." Fred 
Claire, Dodger vice president, would have liked to have making such a contract 
announcement, as he attempted to acquire Dykstra in the middle of last season 
and last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher, who postponed Tuesday's scheduled first day of rehabilitative 
throwing, said his shoulder still does not feel good enough to to pitch. "I 
don't even need to feel good, I'll settle for feeling better," said Belcher, 
who has not thrown since he went on the disabled list Aug. 17 with shoulder 
tendinitis.

TOO LATE, ANGELS RESEMBLE A CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was how it was supposed to be: the Angels would get strong efforts from 
their starting pitchers, the occasional opportunistic hit and enough home runs 
to make them a factor in the American League West race. 
</P>
<P>
They're doing all that, except the race is for third place. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on two debatable intentional walks ordered by Texas Manager Bobby 
Valentine in the seventh inning, the Angels scored seven times to break open a 
close game and rout the Rangers, 9-2, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish's three-run home run, a 393-foot drive to right-center that was 
his 21st of the season, highlighted an inning in which the Angels sent 11 
batters to the plate and routed John Barfield (3-2), who had relieved Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott (9-12) allowed eight hits over 7 1/3 innings and struck out a 
season-high seven as the Angels won their fifth consecutive game and moved 
within a half-game of the third-place Rangers. In sweeping Texas for the first 
time since June 22-24, 1987 -- and the first at Anaheim Stadium since June 
16-18, 1986 -- the Angels climbed above .500 (66-65) for the first time since 
June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine prolonged the Angels' seventh-inning spree by intentionally walking 
Dick Schofield, a .229 hitter, to match the left-handed Barfield against the 
left-handed hitting Luis Polonia with Jack Howell on second. That backfired 
when Polonia singled to center, scoring Howell. Center fielder Gary Pettis' 
throw home was dropped by catcher Mike Stanley, and Schofield took third and 
Polonia second on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine then walked switch-hitter Devon White -- a .257 hitter right-handed 
-- to get to Chili Davis, a .265 hitter from the right side. Davis walked on 
four pitches, forcing in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield's single off Brad Arnsberg scored two more runs and Parrish 
provided the final touch with his home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels gave Abbott a run to work with in the third. Johnny Ray led off with 
a liner that struck the glove of third baseman Jeff Kunkel and carried into 
left field, where it eluded Pete Incaviglia long enough for Ray to scamper to 
second. Ray tagged and took third when Schofield lined to right and scored on 
Polonia's grounder to second. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott faced the minimum nine batters through the first three innings. He 
allowed a leadoff single to Ruben Sierra in the second, but Sierra was erased 
in a double play initiated by Abbott. He stabbed Jack Daugherty's comebacker, 
whirled and made a throw to second that was slightly wide of the bag. Ray 
snared the ball and relayed to first to complete the Angels' major 
league-leading 150th double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' offense gave Abbott additional support in the fourth. Davis led off 
with a single to right and took second on Lee Stevens' grounder to first. First 
baseman Daugherty glanced at second to see if he had a play there, but went for 
the sure out at first. That proved important, as Parrish ended an 0-for-6 dry 
spell with a single to left-center, scoring Davis. That increased Parrish's 
club-leading RBI total to 58. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia ended a longer slump in the fifth when he slammed a 1 and 0 pitch 
from Abbott off the facing of the right-field seats for his 19th home run of 
the season. Incaviglia had been hitless in his previous 16 at-bats and had 
three hits in his previous 43 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia's homer was the first run scored by the Rangers in 15 2/3 innings 
against the Angels, since an RBI-single by Jeff Huson with one out in the 
seventh inning Monday night. Kirk McCaskill shut the Rangers out Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got Huson on a called third strike leading off the sixth. Then Pettis 
singled, but Abbott induced Kunkel to fly to left and struck out Julio Franco 
for his season-best seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott faced his first real challenge in the seventh, a threat in which he got 
little help from the Angels' defense. Sierra singled up the middle and 
Incaviglia followed with a blooper to right that fell a few steps in front of a 
slow-running Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty moved the runners up with a sacrifice played by Abbott, and Mike 
Stanley was intentionally walked to create a play at any base. John Russell hit 
a hopper to third baseman Howell, who kept the ball in front of him but allowed 
it to roll up and off his chest and behind him. When he recovered, his only 
play was to step on third to force Incaviglia, and Sierra scored the tying run.

Ken Griffey was signed by the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday, joining Ken Jr. to 
become the first father and son to play on the same major league team. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Griffeys became the first father and son to play in the major 
leagues at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Griffey said the chance to play with his son is the highlight 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"This to me is No. 1," he said with a smile. "It's a dream come true being a 
father. It all happened because he made it happen. I didn't think he would get 
to the big leagues as fast as he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very proud of what we've accomplished," Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jr., 20, the Mariners' starting center fielder the past two seasons, 
attended a news conference at the Kingdome with his father before Wednesday's 
game against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The father-son duo then took batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Griffey bantered with his father but said nothing to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, an 18-year major leaguer, was placed on waivers Friday by the 
Cincinnati Reds. He cleared waivers Wednesday, becoming a free agent.

UMPIRES UPSET AT CRITICISM FROM WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill White, National League president, angered major league umpires Wednesday 
by issuing a statement criticizing umpire Joe West's recent handling of an 
ejection while revealing that West has been ordered not to touch a player, even 
when breaking up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely stunned," said Richie Phillips, umpires' union general counsel, 
of the statement. "This lack of support has never, ever happened before. It 
sends a signal to the players that it's open season on umpires." 
</P>
<P>
White's statement was in response to West's comments after a meeting here 
Tuesday between the umpire and the NL president. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with the way West slammed Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to 
the ground during the Phillies' recent brawl with the New York Mets. It also 
dealt with how West recently ejected Phillie outfielder Von Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, West said: "As of today, the umpires are not to become 
involved in any more fights. If (players) want to fight, let them go kill each 
other. If it gets that out of hand, we'll call the National Guard." 
</P>
<P>
White's statement purported to clarify that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"In my meeting with Joe West yesterday, I told him that since he has been 
involved in a number of on-field incidents with players, he is no longer to 
physically touch a player," the statement said. "All other umpires are to 
continue acting as they have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
White added: "I also told Joe that I did not agree with his handling of the Von 
Hayes situation." 
</P>
<P>
West, 37, a regular National League umpire for 13 seasons, had ejected Hayes in 
an Aug. 21 game at Dodger Stadium after Hayes, upset with a balls and strikes 
call by Harry Wendelstedt, got to first base on a fielder's choice and said 
something derogatory about Wendelstedt to first base coach John Vukovich. West 
overheard it, ejected him and White, apparently feeling that action 
inappropriate since no comment had been directed toward West, reprimanded West 
for the call. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said, "Yes, our umpires are aggressive, but they have to be 
aggressive. We don't have the intermediate control that officials in other 
sports have. We can't assess 15-yard penalties, or make a team play 
shorthanded, or issue a technical foul."

LOYOLA RECRUITS 6-10 PLAYER FROM CZECH NATIONAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount basketball team has apparently filled its biggest need, 
getting a 6-foot-10 center. Richard Petruska, 21-year-old center for the 
Czechoslovakian national team, attended the first day of classes at the school 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Petruska, who has spent much of the summer in the Southland, was apparently 
interested in attending a California college and shifted his attention to 
Loyola when Ed O'Bannon, star high school player from Artesia, recently chose 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Czech team played a preseason game at Loyola two years ago, and Petruska 
scored 36 points, making 15 of 17 shots, mostly layups. Petruska will have 
three years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big, he's tall, he runs pretty well," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said, 
adding that he won't know if he can play at Loyola's hectic pace until practice 
starts Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hillock, assistant coach, said: "He's a low-post player. We don't have much 
of a feel (but) we think he can be an impact player. We think he can score 
points." 
</P>
<P>
Points have been Loyola's forte, but most of them are gone with the graduation 
of Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, the decision of forward Per Stumer not to return 
to school, and with the death of Hank Gathers. ALAN DROOZ

SAN DIEGO STATE'S DAN MCGWIRE FACING TALL ORDERS NOW; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE 6-8 QUARTERBACK PASSED FOR 3,651 YARDS LAST SEASON, AND 
HE EXPECTS CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The videos were a hit last fall. They featured the San Diego State-of-the-art 
offense directed by the Aztecs' long, tall quarterback, Dan McGwire. They got a 
thumbs-up from most of the critics. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire was called the most underrated quarterback in the country in 1989 by 
one publication. He has been highly touted by two others this year. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the critics saw the videos -- in the form of game films or 
television highlights -- and raved. But there are a couple who, although 
impressed, think McGwire, the tallest quarterback in NCAA Division I at 
6-feet-8, can deliver more. They are McGwire's toughest critics. 
</P>
<P>
Their names are Al Luginbill, San Diego State's coach, and . . . Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
When the two flipped on the VCR in the Aztec football operations center and 
plugged in game films last season, they both liked what they saw. But both 
wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Luginbill, kept saying, Danny is a good quarterback. But he can be better. 
</P>
<P>
When the season ended. McGwire took a couple of weeks to unwind. He reread the 
statistical sheets, replayed a few games in his head and came to that very 
conclusion. He had been a thrower, he determined, not a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this was the same McGwire who had thrown for 3,651 yards in 1989, the 
second-highest single-season total in school history and ninth-best for a 
season in the pass-happy Western Athletic Conference -- and the same guy who 
completed 258 of 440 passes for 57%. 
</P>
<P>
He did all of that in what was basically an adjustment year for him, when he 
spent much of his time answering questions about his transfer from Iowa and 
about being the younger brother of Oakland Athletics star Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he made the adjustment very well," Luginbill said. "I don't think 
there are too many people in college football who threw for over 3,400 yards in 
their first year. Ty Detmer didn't." 
</P>
<P>
True. Detmer, the Brigham Young star, passed for 1,252 yards in 1988, his first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a thrower," McGwire said, slowly. "I remember seeing (Detmer) on the field 
last year, how he moved the chains. It's amazing how he is so precise and crisp 
in his passing. He doesn't have a strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can be a thrower. A quarterback is someone who can move the chains, 
someone who makes the right decisions on the right downs. A quarterback has got 
to be aware of all of that -- what down it is, what yardage he needs." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire said he wasn't as aware of what he needed to do in certain situations 
last season as he needed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there were times I'd force balls," he said. "That's not being a 
quarterback. I'd get greedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Example: BYU. I threw a touchdown pass over the middle. The next time, I tried 
to go over the middle again, and it got picked off. I've got to take what they 
give me. When they take the middle away, I've got to go over the top. I have to 
be more aware of that than I am -- knowing down and distance." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire discusses the things you would expect a guy starting his senior season 
of eligibility to talk about, such as how badly he wants to lead the Aztecs to 
a bowl game this season and what his prospects might be in the NFL draft. But 
the conversation usually ranges back to the improvement he needs to make if 
things are to go as he hopes. 
</P>
<P>
He is the marquee player on a team picked by WAC coaches to finish fifth in the 
conference. His height allows him good vision all over the field and a strong 
arm gives him the ability to throw the football just about anywhere he wants. 
</P>
<P>
"In practice, very few people I've been with can throw a seven-step deep 
comeback route like he can," said Steve Fairchild, Aztec quarterback coach. 
"I'm talking about a route where he's dropping back 10 yards and the guy is 
running 20. Sometimes he throws 20 yards across the field and it doesn't arc at 
all. It's just a rope, a flat rope. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not to be impressed with the guy's arm strength." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs finished 6-5-1 in 1989, their first winning season since '86, and 
that was largely because of McGwire. They averaged 30.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a learning experience in a couple of ways. Not only was McGwire new 
to San Diego State last season, Luginbill and his staff were also in their 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there was a new coaching staff and a new scheme," McGwire said. "I 
think people will see a new Dan McGwire this year." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, he followed a special workout program this summer devised by David 
Ohton, the team's strength and conditioning coach. The sessions, designed to 
increase McGwire's foot speed and agility, lasted for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have such a quick, drop-back passing game here," McGwire said. "Being a big 
guy, I need to be quick." 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, for an hour a day, McGwire worked out in the sand. He ran 
10-play series, working on his bootlegs, play-actions, handoffs and drop-backs 
of various distances. He ran 40- and 15-yard sprints. 
</P>
<P>
"He trained much like a boxer, soccer player or volleyball player," Ohton said. 
"The first week, when he was jumping over cones laterally, he was like an 
ostrich. Terrible. After a week, he went over the cones like they weren't even 
there. In three weeks, he accomplished more than a lot of athletes. Not just 
quarterbacks, athletes." 
</P>
<P>
The goal was to do so many repetitions in the sand that McGwire would not even 
think about foot placement as he backpedaled. Then, when he moved onto the 
grass, it would come naturally and he would be quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a big man like that backpedal and you think he's slow," Ohton said. 
"But he's not. He's 245 pounds and he is solid." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire gained about 10 pounds during the summer and said he would like to 
maintain a weight somewhere between 240 and 245 this season. Last season, he 
said, he weighed about 235 at the start but lost about 15 by the time the 
Aztecs were finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it affected me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is also stronger. His bench press is up to 325 pounds from 280. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my lifts are improving," he said. "I feel really strong. I feel really 
good as far as the physical part (goes)." 
</P>
<P>
But McGwire is as concerned with the mental nuances of the game as with the 
physical part this season. One of the things that bothered him in 1989 was his 
yardage and touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio. He threw for 16 touchdowns and 
19 interceptions. By comparison, Detmer, his WAC measuring stick who threw for 
4,560 yards, had 32 touchdowns and only 15 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, it was a bad fall for me," he said. "That was (the coaches') big 
key, and mine, during the spring. In the spring, I really worked on decision 
making. I wanted to be a better decision maker." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill is happy with McGwire's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarterback uses his offense, moves the chains and is patient," Luginbill 
said. "Dan has all of these qualities. Now, he needs to execute. He had two 
interceptions in close to 200 throws in spring practice (during scrimmages), 
and one of those was a tipped ball. Those are the kinds of things we're looking 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about him because of the progress he's made, and he should be, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Said McGwire: "I thought I was doing all right, but when I go back and evaluate 
. . . A lot of people say I had a good year numbers-wise but, if I made the 
right decisions, the numbers could have been astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a big-numbers guy. I want to move the chains on our way to putting 
points on the board. For the team to win, I need to throw the ball. All of my 
individual goals will come in team success on the field."

Peter Isler, who led one of four designated American defense syndicates for the 
1992 America's Cup, dropped out because of funding difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of mounting a top-level campaign exceeds $20 million," Isler said. 
"Time is so short that rather than compromising our campaign's chances of 
victory, we have decided to withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
Isler had signed only one major sponsor: Hewlett-Packard. The America's Cup 
Organizing Committee had set a deadline of Oct. 1 for defense syndicates to 
show they had secured $6 million in sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
The other defense syndicates remaining are headed by Dennis Conner and Larry 
Klein of San Diego and John Bertrand of Newport Beach.

BANKS OFFER TO DEFER PAYMENT FOR RESERVISTS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: GLENDALE FEDERAL DECISION ON LOAN PAYMENTS FOLLOWS ACTION BY WELLS 
FARGO AND FIRST INTERSTATE -- MOVES AN INDUSTRY EXPERT CALLS 'REALLY 
EXTRAORDINARY.'

As a commander in the Navy Reserve called into active duty last weekend, John 
Greif's salary will be less than a third of what he makes as a surgeon for 
Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, it is going to be a tremendous financial hardship," said Greif, 
who has been assigned for three months to a military hospital in South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
One of the La Jolla surgeon's primary financial concerns when he learned he had 
been called up to active duty was how he was going to make payments on his 
loans, which include $4,000-plus a month for his mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
So Greif was understandably relieved when one of his lenders, Glendale Federal 
Bank, announced Monday that it would defer payments on all real estate and 
consumer loans held by military reservists called into active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Federal's action, which is above and beyond what federal law requires 
lenders to do for activated reservists, followed similar steps announced late 
last week by Wells Fargo and First Interstate banks. But Glendale Federal 
executives say the announcement was not a copycat gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually were planning this last week," spokesman Carol Kramer said Monday. 
Wells Fargo "just beat us to the punch." 
</P>
<P>
Like Glendale Federal, Wells Fargo and First Interstate have said they will 
allow activated reservists to defer principal and interest payments on all 
consumer loans. The deferrals will remain in effect for the duration of the 
reservists' active-duty assignments and will cover only debts incurred before 
activation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 requires banks only to 
limit interest payments to 6% if reservists can show that their activation will 
cause serious financial hardship. Employers are not required by federal law to 
compensate reservists for any loss of income their activation might cause. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Preston, a vice president at First Interstate, said the purpose of his 
bank's action is to support their reservist customers who have been called up 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our intent to support them while they're there," Preston said. "It makes 
life a little bit easier for them, less worries." 
</P>
<P>
Such a move also has image value for the bank, Preston acknowledged. "But what 
can you say about that? No, it doesn't look bad (for the bank). It does look 
good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo promoted its policy in advertisements addressed to "reservists and 
their families" in 15 California newspapers Monday. But Wells Fargo officials 
have insisted that their only motive is civic goodwill and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a show of support. It's patriotic," said Lorna Doubet, spokeswoman for 
Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from all three banks say they do not know specifically how many of 
their customers will be affected by the call-up. But they also say they are 
confident the number is fairly small. Therefore, the loss of revenue caused by 
the waived or reduced interest payments will not much affect the institutions' 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kurmel, executive director of the California Bankers Assn. in San 
Francisco, said other California banks may follow the examples set by Wells 
Fargo, Glendale and First Interstate. However, most banks will not do much more 
for reservists than required by law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For (a financial) institution to come out and go that extra mile is really 
extraordinary," Kurmel said. "It's expensive to do that. . . . There's just an 
awful lot of logistics involved." 
</P>
<P>
"Most banks are going to look at their (reservist) borrowers on an individual 
basis," he said. "The numbers we're talking about may not be that awesome. . . 
. It's a real individual situation, and it's the kind of thing that is best 
dealt with one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greif and his wife, Kate, a former accountant, have been looking for 
ways to cut back on their expenses for the duration of his three-month 
activation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kate Greif said, she and her husband had considered selling 
their house to buy a bigger one. Now their plans will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months ago, we were optimistic and foolish," she said. "It's 
ironic that way."

FIRMS TO ADD FUEL TO RIDESHARE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS PLAN CONTEST AMONG BUSINESSES TO 
ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN ANNUAL CAR-POOLING WEEK, OCT. 1-5. 
</P>

Don't drive alone. 
</P>
<P>
That's the message that state and local transportation officials will be trying 
to spread during the annual statewide celebration of Rideshare Week in October. 
</P>
<P>
To drive that message home this year, the celebration's organizers have planned 
an event that they hope will get business executives across San Diego County to 
urge their employees to use alternate transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Local organizers hope about 200 San Diego County businesses will participate in 
"The Great Corporate Ride-Off," a competition designed to get more commuters to 
use car-pools or ride bicycles, trains or buses to work. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two weeks, companies that want to participate in the competition 
can call 237-POOL to order pledge cards, said Carolyn Wormser, a public 
information officer for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Oct. 3, the mid-point of the five-day Rideshare Week celebration, each 
company will turn in pledge cards for all of its employees who have agreed to 
use something other than personal vehicles to get to work that day, Wormser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way for companies to start participating," said Anne Dash, 
chairwoman of a city transportation subcommittee, after explaining the 
competition at a "Corporate Kickoff" ceremony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Companies will be divided by size into four divisions, and the company that 
turns in the most pledge cards in each division will win a trophy, Dash said. 
</P>
<P>
Others can participate in the pledge drive, even if their businesses are not 
involved in the competition, by calling the 237-POOL number, said Gable 
Beurskens, assistant director of Commuter Computer, a local transportation 
management organization. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who makes a pledge will be eligible to win a statewide raffle. Top 
prizes in the raffle will include free trips to Hawaii and West Germany, 
Wormser said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl West, deputy district director for the California Department of 
Transportation, said ride-sharing relieves traffic congestion, reduces air 
pollution, cuts dependence on foreign oil sources and combats increasing 
transportation and parking costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we leave our cars at home one day a week, it will make a large 
difference," West told about 150 businessmen at the ceremony.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAYS OFFICER JUSTIFIED IN SHOOTING YOUTH AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer was legally justified when he shot and wounded a 
17-year-old Mexican youth, because the youth, apparently armed with a knife, 
kept running toward the officer despite repeated warnings to stop, according to 
a letter from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The incident unfolded shortly before 11 p.m. July 8 when officers from the San 
Diego Police Border Crime Intervention Unit attempted to arrest two juveniles 
they suspected of robbing groups near the U.S.-Mexico border in the 3100 block 
of Monument Road. 
</P>
<P>
One of the youths ran toward the spot where Officers Joseph Bane, 33, and Mike 
Gutierrez, 25, who were in uniform, were stationed to stop them from running 
back across the border, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated warnings in Spanish from Bane, the boy continued to run and 
allegedly raised a knife in the air. Bane, who was about 3 feet from the boy, 
fired two shots from his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, hitting the boy 
once in the thigh, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Bane fired his weapon under a reasonable fear that (the youth) would 
cause him grievous and possibly fatal injury in his efforts to escape 
apprehension," says the letter, dated Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Jose Luis Gonzalez Salazar, pleaded guilty to robbery 
charges and has been prosecuted by the Juvenile Division, where he is awaiting 
sentencing, the letter says. Another youth, 15-year-old Miguel Arnana, also 
pleaded guilty to robbery charges and is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the first such incident involving the border crime unit since 
its reinstatement in June, after being sidelined by highly publicized and 
controversial shootings. One incident involved the shooting of a 17-year-old 
Mexican youth last December who is now paralyzed from the waist down.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED IN GUN BATTLE WITH HOME 
INTRUDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman who asked for his target victim by name opened fire inside a house, 
trading shots with the victim before killing the man and fleeing with two other 
suspects, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives had not established a motive for the gun battle at a home in the 300 
block of Artesia Lane in Long Beach about 7:35 p.m. Tuesday, Lt. Carroll Shelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Hernandez, 21, of San Pedro, was visiting friends when another man entered 
the residence and called Hernandez by name, Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then began firing a semiautomatic weapon at Hernandez, Shelly said, 
with Hernandez returning fire. 
</P>
<P>
A second gunman in a car also opened fire, he said, before all three fled.

TWO STUDENTS ARRESTED AFTER CHASE ARE SUSPECTS IN STRING OF ROBBERIES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE IS STILL INVESTIGATING WHETHER DEATH OF THIRD 
YOUNG MAN WAS A SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A college football player and a student at a prestigious Southern university 
are under investigation in a string of up to 10 robberies this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The two are in jail, scheduled to be arraigned on charges of committing three 
robberies Tuesday morning -- two in Escondido and one of a cabbie in Vista. The 
pair were arrested after a freeway chase early that morning that ended with the 
death of a third young man. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Hubert Phillips was a star senior fullback with the Southwest 
High Raiders in south San Diego, averaging 116.5 yards a game. A Times second 
team all-county pick, he was redshirted the next year with the University of 
New Mexico Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail in County Jail on 
suspicion of three counts of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really explain it," said his father, Charlie Phillips. "He was raised 
the proper way. He knew you don't get anything unless you work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested after the car chase, which began in Vista, was 18-year-old 
Jonathan Arrington, who last year attended prestigious Tuskegee University in 
Tuskegee, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The third male, 17-year-old Cahill Muhammad, was found dead in the back seat of 
the car. The county medical examiner's office said Wednesday that Muhammad died 
of gunshot wounds in the head, but it had not yet determined if they were 
self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, investigators said the death was apparently a suicide. Muhammad 
lived on Saturn Boulevard, not far from Southwest High School, according to the 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Macagno, who was having coffee at his home a few doors from the school, 
said he heard four to six gunshots just before a car crashed into a fireplug on 
the campus shortly after 4 a.m. He did not see who fired them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrington, who turns 19 on Friday, is also being held on suspicion of auto 
theft and evading police and is scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. today in 
Vista Municipal Court. However, jail officials say that appearance will have to 
wait because Arrington must also appear at 12:30 p.m. at South Bay Superior 
Court in Chula Vista. He is being held on $50,500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' arraignment is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Maria, an assistant sports information director at the University of New 
Mexico, confirmed that Phillips was on the football team there last year. But 
he is not on this year's roster, she said, adding that she did not know why. 
</P>
<P>
Tuskegee University officials confirmed that Arrington was a student there last 
year, but they could not confirm that he was enrolled there for classes this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Southwestern College in Chula Vista said Arrington had been 
taking summer classes there. Court records indicate he is a sophomore at 
Tuskegee. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time this summer that Phillips and Arrington have gotten 
into trouble with the law. They and another man were charged Aug. 7 with grand 
theft and robbery in connection with a July 8 incident, Superior Court records 
show. Both pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido police say the two are suspected of robbing two businesses in that 
city Tuesday just before the cabbie was robbed. 
</P>
<P>
After the robberies, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers 
chased a stolen white Honda 50 miles, from Vista to south San Diego, after 
deputies matched its license plate to a partial number given by the cabbie. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the car plowed into the fireplug. Two men fled on foot, 
and deputies gave chase and arrested Arrington at the school. Phillips was 
arrested at his home Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Police are trying to determine if the men were involved in a string of up to 10 
robberies over the past six weeks, including one at a motel on Kearny Mesa Road 
on Aug. 4, in which off-duty Huntington Beach Police Officer Robert Barr was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still looking at them as possible suspects," San Diego police spokesman 
Dave Cohen said. But "we don't have anything that links them with (any San 
Diego) cases." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido police said they suspect that the men might also be responsible for 
two robberies there last Thursday.

REFEREE STOPS FIGHT AS LOBBYIST WILSON, SENATOR SQUARE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Senate's chief sergeant-at-arms said Wednesday that he prevented 
lobbyist Bob Wilson, a former state senator from San Diego, from slugging a 
state senator during an argument over a judges' pension bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sergeant-at-Arms Tony Beard said the incident took place Tuesday afternoon in a 
hallway outside the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Beard said he was talking to someone else when he overheard a conversation 
between Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) and Wilson become "more personal than 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson started to take a swing at Lockyer, Beard said, but he grabbed Wilson's 
arm and prevented him from landing the blow. 
</P>
<P>
"I leaped and grabbed him by the biceps and held him up against the wall," 
Beard said, adding that he walked Wilson down the hall to calm him down. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wilson nor Lockyer wanted to talk about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The president pro tem (of the Senate) has suggested that it would be better 
not to have a lot of comment . . . ," Lockyer said. "I prefer to not say 
anything and let the wounds heal." 
</P>
<P>
He did say that the dispute was over legislation dealing with whether counties 
should be allowed to pay judges' share of payments to the judges' retirement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the behest of its chairman, 
Lockyer, had fashioned legislative language that officially rescinded an 
agreement calling for San Diego County to pay for $800,000 in annual pension 
contributions that would otherwise come out of the pockets of its 127 Municipal 
and Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
The special agreement was contained in a bill sponsored last year by former 
Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), who saw the measure signed into law a few 
months before he left the Legislature to become a municipal judge himself. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling said he has also talked with his former colleagues, arguing against 
the pension change. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also wouldn't discuss the incident in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Tempers flare at the end of the session," Wilson said. "I feel bad about it. 
We've been friends. I guess it's been 17 years. We'll continue to be friends, 
I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
"My temper got the best of me."

JOHN ARTHUR BOLGER; RETIRED SOUND ENGINEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Arthur Bolger, an Oscar-nominee sound engineer for Universal Pictures and 
longtime North Hollywood resident, has died in Woodland Hills. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Bolger died Aug. 22 of pneumonia, said his wife, Bessie Bolger. 
</P>
<P>
A native of England, Bolger came to the United States in the early 1920s and 
settled in North Hollywood in 1924. He went to work in the electrical 
department of Universal Pictures in 1925 but later became a sound engineer with 
the rise of "talkies" in the late 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on hundreds of films, including "The Countess of Monte Cristo" 
(1934), "Bedtime for Bonzo" (1951) and "Earthquake" (1974). In 1976, the year 
he retired, Bolger was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on "The 
Hindenburg." 
</P>

ACTIVIST GROUPS FILE LAWSUIT OVER NUCLEAR EXPERIMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY IS NAMED IN THE ACTION AIMED AT BLOCKING 
THE PROJECT, WHICH PUBLIC OUTCRY FORCED OUT OF SANTA SUSANA LAB. 
</P>

<P>
A coalition of arms control and environmental groups Wednesday filed a lawsuit 
against the U.S. Department of Energy in an attempt to block plutonium 
extraction experiments that were recently transferred from Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth to the 
University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accused the department of violating the National Environmental 
Policy Act, or NEPA, by failing to conduct a full environmental review of the 
research program, known as TRUMP-S, and by failing to seek comments from the 
public and other agencies before deciding no environmental study was needed. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-page complaint was filed in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of 
seven activist groups, including three that fought Rockwell's plan to conduct 
the experiments at Santa Susana, where the firm does work for the Department of 
Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from San Fernando Valley and eastern Ventura County activists, 
Rockwell announced in April that it had subcontracted the nuclear portion of 
the work to the University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks an injunction to delay the TRUMP-S work and to require the 
department to prepare an environmental impact statement. It was uncertain when 
a hearing on the request will be held. 
</P>
<P>
The action was filed in San Francisco because the project is managed by 
officials of the department's area office there. 
</P>
<P>
Energy officials believe "we complied with NEPA requirements, and we conducted 
our activities properly," an agency spokesman said. "However, in view of this 
suit, we will certainly revisit the issue and determine if any revisions have 
to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell, which is not a defendant, said the 
company also believes there was no need for an environmental impact statement. 
</P>
<P>
TRUMP-S -- short for Transuranic Management by Pyropartitioning-Separation -- 
is an effort to reduce the volume of the most long-lived nuclear wastes in need 
of perpetual isolation. The experiments themselves involve the handling of 
small amounts of uranium, americium, neptunium and highly dangerous plutonium 
in a shielded laboratory. Support for the work has come from the department and 
the Japanese electric power industry, with Rockwell the principal contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents and opponents of TRUMP-S say the process could have worldwide 
ramifications, but there the agreement ends. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell says the process, if perfected, would be a breakthrough in management 
of spent nuclear fuel. The most long-lived elements, such as plutonium, would 
be extracted through electrochemical reactions, making it possible to reduce 
the volume of waste needing permanent care. 
</P>
<P>
Such a breakthrough could revive the fortunes of the nuclear industry, long in 
a slump because of cost overruns and environmental concerns about lack of 
permanent sites to dispose of high-level waste. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said in the lawsuit that TRUMP-S could worsen radioactive 
contamination by allowing the shorter-lived elements of high-level waste to be 
put in existing land burial sites. They said it could also increase the risk of 
nuclear weapons proliferation by making it easier to extract plutonium for use 
in bombs. 
</P>
<P>
It "would be a great financial boon for the nuclear industry but a disaster for 
the environment," Dan Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, one 
of the groups that filed the lawsuit, said on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the Southern California Federation of 
Scientists, Los Angeles Physicians for Social Responsibility and Mid-Missouri 
Nuclear Weapons Freeze Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's request to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do the TRUMP-S 
work at Santa Susana was bitterly opposed by local activists. Proceedings 
before the NRC abruptly ended in April when the company announced an agreement 
to farm out the nuclear part of the work to the University of Missouri, with 
which it had been secretly negotiating for months. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit Wednesday released a copy of a February, 1990, memo 
in which university officials were urged to remain silent on the project at 
Rockwell's request. 
</P>
<P>
The memo from a member of the university's news bureau said: "In case you were 
unaware, we were advised by Rockwell not to release the information until after 
the agreements were in force, due to possible problems from an activist group 
in California that is instrumental in forcing the research out of that state. 
It is important that the news of this partnership not be released prior to the 
press conference so we can secure positive media coverage of the new 
partnership."

SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL ADDS OPENING PRAYER TO AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, after briefly debating religion in government 
and the separation of church and state, agreed to begin each council meeting 
with a moment of prayer or reflection. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who expressed reservations about mixing government with 
religion, asked her colleagues to forgo a roll-call vote because a negative 
vote on the issue could expose a council member to criticism from the public. 
</P>
<P>
The council acted late Tuesday night at the urging of Councilman Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon, who noted that many government bodies -- from Congress to state 
legislatures -- open their proceedings with prayer. 
</P>
<P>
In addressing McKeon, Heidt said, "I just don't want anybody to be judged if 
they disagree with you," Heidt said. 
</P>
<P>
But resident Skip Newhall said the council should not allow prayers in the 
council chambers because it could suggest the city was endorsing some religions 
over others. "Religion belongs in the churches," Newhall said. "That's why we 
have them." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said a prayer or moment of reflection merely would acknowledge the 
spiritual side of the community. "I have no ambition to bring religion in 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the council did not vote on McKeon's request but allowed 
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy to declare that each meeting would begin with prayer, 
inspirational remarks or a moment of silence. Each council member would take 
turns inviting guest clergy or speakers to offer the prayer or remarks.

MAN'S BODY FOUND NORTH OF CITY LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decomposing body of a man has been discovered along Paxton Street north of 
the Los Angeles city limits, sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday about 400 feet south of Lopez Canyon 
Road in an unincorporated part of the county, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The body had been there about five days, Ramirez said. It was of a man possibly 
in his 20s, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 120 pounds with black hair and wearing a 
light blue tank top, light blue slacks, a military style web belt, white tennis 
shoes and a string necklace with a plastic cross, Ramirez said. There was no 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy is scheduled, Ramirez said.

AIR GUARD UNIT FORMERLY BASED IN VAN NUYS ANSWERS CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a classroom cluttered with duffel bags, sitting at tables covered with gas 
masks and rubber boots, 14 "citizen soldiers" prepared for war Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The seven men and seven women -- members of the 146th Aeromedical Evacuation 
Squadron at the Channel Islands Air National Guard Base -- volunteered for duty 
when President Bush decided to activate more than 49,000 reservists. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, they got the call. Coming from as far as San Diego and 
Long Beach and as near as Chatsworth and Simi Valley, they rushed to the 
Ventura County base for six hours of briefings, films, paperwork and 
inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they are expected to leave "for somewhere east of here," a Guard 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he could not be more specific, but the preparations -- 
including chemical warfare briefings and inoculations for hepatitis and 
meningitis -- gave credence to unofficial reports that the team of nurses and 
medical technicians is headed for Saudi Arabia after a stop at an Air Force 
base on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't want to go to war, I would have chosen another unit," said Tech. 
Sgt. Barbara Neff, a Los Angeles police officer who has been in the reserves 
for 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
But the wife of an Oceanside reservist, who waited in a hallway for several 
hours while her husband was being briefed, admitted that she is scared. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his decision to volunteer," said the woman, who asked not to be 
identified. Sitting between her 13-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, she 
said she didn't try to talk him out of it. "It wouldn't have mattered." 
</P>
<P>
None of the reservists expressed surprise at being activated, even though it 
has been 22 years since reserves were called up for combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected it," said a member of the unit who lives in Granada Hills. 
"Medical units are first on the scene." 
</P>
<P>
The reservist, who did not want to be identified, said he just received a 
bachelor's degree in politics from Cal State Northridge and was due to start an 
internship in Washington when Iraq invaded Kuwait. As a reservist, he had to 
put his plans on hold. 
</P>
<P>
The aeromedical evacuation squadron has 165 members, most of whom are part-time 
reservists who normally work one weekend a month and two weeks during the 
summer. Until last April, when the Channel Islands base opened, the squadron 
was based at the Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Although the medical evacuation squadron has its headquarters at the Channel 
Islands base at Point Mugu, its members come from all over Southern California. 
The only Ventura County resident among the 14 volunteers processed Wednesday 
was Steven Toberman of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"After seven years of training, I didn't want to be left behind," Toberman 
said, as he waited for inoculations at the base hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After removing his shirt before an audience of television cameramen, still 
photographers and reporters, Toberman extended a tattooed right arm and took 
his shots without flinching. Then he joined the other reservists in an adjacent 
room where they waited to make sure none had allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Toberman and his wife are full-time Guard members. They met in the Guard, and 
both are based at Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pretty supportive" of his decision to volunteer, he said of his wife. 
"Like anyone, she doesn't want to see her husband go." 
</P>
<P>
The unit is well-prepared, he said. "It's constant training," he said. "We have 
lots of experience with gas masks." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for chemical warfare was a big part of the mobilization process. "Get 
your gas masks out on the table," a briefing leader said as soon as the group 
had assembled. Later, he told of the necessity to clean the mask before using 
it and showed how to change the filters. 
</P>
<P>
Next came instruction in fastening rover boots -- giant, one-size-fits-all 
rubber foot-coverings that are needed to seal out poison gas. The reservists 
also saw a video on how to spot and deal with unexploded bombs and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reservists were decked out in green flight suits. A few wore 
camouflage outfits. Each carried a bag of personal items, two canvas bags of 
chemical warfare gear and a sack containing a sleeping bag, food and survival 
gear.

OLVERA STREET PLAN OKD BY COUNCIL RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Away from the glare of the public arena, Los Angeles City Council members 
Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre have put aside personal differences and have 
quietly settled on a unique concept -- a seven-member "authority" -- to govern 
the deteriorating yet still-popular Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
According to city staffers familiar with the talks between the two Eastside 
politicians, the proposed El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument Authority 
has emerged as the best vehicle to jump-start the stalled $30-million 
renovation of the Mexican tourist attraction, on the site where the city was 
founded more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, which has the tentative backing of Olvera Street merchants and a 
group of Chicano historians and activists, is expected to be unveiled next week 
with the blessing of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was forged out of pressure from a Latino leadership weary of the 
political wrangling about Olvera Street. They felt that the street's 
significance in the city's Mexican history should override personal animosities 
between the two council members. 
</P>
<P>
Still a sensitive issue, and one left unclear, is who would sit on the 
authority's board of trustees, and how the agency would affect decisions 
already made by the city, authorizing the creation of a Chinese museum and the 
restoration of a community hall for Italian-Americans within the confines of 
the El Pueblo park. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous city officials, including spokesmen for Alatorre and Molina, declined 
comment on these points. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a carefully crafted thing and the deal could be blown if word would 
get out about this person or that being considered, or if we start talking 
about the specifics," one insider said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and Molina are reportedly trying to draft a list of nominees that the 
mayor could select from, subject to council confirmation. Some Chicano 
activists expressed concern that Alatorre's politically powerful allies could 
be named to the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, the authority is seen as having the best chance of 
governing Olvera Street efficiently. The concept incorporates Molina's strong 
desire for public scrutiny and Alatorre's desire to do away with an outside 
developer to oversee the revitalization work. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the only city-owned facility controlled by an authority board is 
the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
An authority's powers do not differ greatly from those of independent city 
commissions. Alatorre and Molina agree that the city Parks and Recreation 
Commission should no longer manage the street, an aging tourist attraction that 
draws about 2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, whose council district includes the area, favored the creation of a 
private nonprofit corporation as the best entity to ensure the street's Mexican 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, who represented Olvera Street as a state assemblywoman, proposed a new 
municipal commission to ensure public scrutiny of and participation in Olvera 
Street's proposed revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
In June, during the debate over the rival proposals, Molina accused Alatorre of 
engineering a "back-room deal" to install his nonprofit corporation idea. And 
he groused that Molina was grandstanding to curry favor with Latinos, who hold 
Olvera Street in special regard as the Mexican link to the city's founding. 
</P>
<P>
To end the bickering, the two began holding once-a-week talks that have 
resulted in the agreement on a seven-member authority board. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all interested in preserving Olvera Street, but public confidence was 
lost (in the wrangling over the restoration mechanism)," said Al Avila, 
Alatorre's chief deputy. "We're trying to restore public confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Alma Martinez, Molina's chief of staff, agreed, adding: "There has been a 
spirit of cooperation to get (the disagreements) behind us."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARIJUANA PLANTATION FOUND NORTH OF MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 1,621 mature marijuana plants up to 16 feet tall were chopped down 
and removed Wednesday from a secluded, heavily camouflaged field at the foot of 
a steep hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the plants was made Tuesday afternoon on a steep slope about 
300 yards below Saddle Peak Road near Stunt Road after deputies fielded an 
anonymous call tipping them off to the illicit plantation, Sgt. Bob Stoneman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies got the call Monday, but aerial and foot searches of the area in the 
canyons about 5 miles north of Malibu Beach at first missed the plants, which 
were covered by camouflage cloth, Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a sophisticated operation that has been going on for some 
time," Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews chopped down the plants, and a sheriff's helicopter airlifted bundles out 
of the mountains to a fire station in the Malibu hills, Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were in custody.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A heavy construction vehicle punctured a high-pressure natural gas main in 
Palmdale Wednesday morning, releasing a roaring flow of gas that forced the 
evacuation of more than 40 houses and slightly injured a worker. 
</P>
<P>
Souther California Gas Co. workers using a heavy-duty hydraulic clamp closed 
off the six-inch distribution line shortly before 2 p.m., about six hours after 
the rupture near 10th Street West and Beechdale Drive. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 evacuees were allowed back into their homes after the line was sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lopez, 37, a gas company worker, suffered a minor knee injury as a crew 
tried to clamp the line and the gas blew a piece of equipment off the pipe, 
knocking Lopez down. He was treated and released at Palmdale Hospital.

<P>
A San Pedro special education teacher was convicted Wednesday of physically and 
mentally abusing five of her young disabled students by hitting and threatening 
to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court jury found Willenberg Special Education Center teacher 
Juanita Barnett, 59, of Los Angeles, guilty of five counts of willful cruelty 
toward a child. She was convicted of striking five children with her hands, a 
hairbrush and a jigsaw puzzle, and of threatening them with death or injury, 
said Deputy City Atty. Juana Webman. 
</P>
<P>
Webman presented evidence that Barnett called the children "crippled," told 
some she wished them dead, and threatened to beat one boy unconscious. None of 
the students, ages 9 to 12, were seriously injured from the abuse.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR PLEADS GUILTY IN TAMPERING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal juror removed for suspected tampering with deliberations just hours 
before Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland was convicted last May of 
making an illegal political donation pleaded guilty Wednesday to one felony 
count of criminal contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Kuhnke, 33, of Huntington Beach, a U.S. Defense Department employee, told 
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie that he had approached Goland and offered 
to fix the case because he felt Goland was being unfairly prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Goland reported the offer to his attorney, who notified U.S. District Judge 
Dickran Tevrizian. Tevrizian removed Kuhnke from the jury the next day. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Kuhnke's guilty plea, prosecutors have agreed to drop a second 
felony count of obstruction of justice. Rafeedie set sentencing for Oct. 4. 
Federal statutes set no limits for either a fine or jail time for criminal 
contempt, although the judge cannot sentence Kuhnke to both a fine and jail.

PROBERS SAY SUB COULD HAVE AVOIDED FATAL TUG ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Navy submarine that accidentally sank a tugboat just outside Los Angeles 
Harbor last spring probably would have avoided the disaster -- in which the 
tug's pilot was killed -- had the crew used its "active" sonar before 
surfacing, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which recently completed its investigation of the incident, found 
that the submarine's crew had activated only its "passive" sonar, which offers 
a murkier picture of objects at the surface of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Navy submarines often use only the passive sonar because enemy craft can trace 
them more easily when they use the "active" system. 
</P>
<P>
But NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said the board found that the crew of the 
submarine Houston had little reason to be concerned that the sonar signal might 
be traced. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in costal waters," he noted. "In this particular accident, we felt, 
there was no need for the submarine to be in some sort of secret mode." 
</P>
<P>
In the June 14, 1989, incident, the submarine surfaced and snagged one of two 
steel towlines that connected the tugboat Barcona to two barges it was pulling. 
The Santa Catalina Island-bound tug was dragged underwater and pilot Bryan 
Ballanger killed. 
</P>
<P>
The submarine crew later said in a Navy report that it had picked up the 
tugboat on its passive sonar, but mistook the barges for sailboats because they 
made little noise. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board is still preparing its official report, Pollock said it 
would recommend the use of sonar devices in coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB report will also recommend mandatory emergency-release mechanisms for 
tugboat towlines and suggest that tugs keep certain doors closed when at sea, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had had an emergency towline release, they may have been able to free 
themselves," Pollock said.

SINGER'S 'NATURAL GUARD' PLANTS SEEDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richie Havens, the folk singer who grew up a street kid in Brooklyn and later 
founded an East Coast-based environmental education program for urban children, 
on Wednesday planted the seeds for a West Coast branch of his Natural Guard. 
</P>
<P>
At a Glendora press conference attended by Havens, U.S. Forest Service 
officials and environmental educators, the Angeles National Forest was singled 
out as one of the first places the seeds will probably grow here. 
</P>
<P>
"You give kids something to do, and there is no gang, there (are) no 
street-corner drugs," the 49-year-old Havens said at the Mt. Baldy Ranger 
District office of the Angeles Forest. "Under the guise of the environment, 
geography can be taught, sciences and humanities can be taught, and the need to 
get rid of poverty, homeless and drugs can be taught." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that it's a far-fetched idea," added the deep-voiced singer, who 
is best known for his performance at the 1969 Woodstock music festival. 
</P>
<P>
Havens earlier this year started the Natural Guard as an adjunct to his 
14-year-old Northwind Undersea Institute, a Bronx-based organization that 
offers marine education and environmental programs to 30,000 New York 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he has fostered the start of Natural Guard chapters in New Haven, 
Conn., and Baltimore, and one is in the works in Washington, D.C. Havens said 
his organization provides educational materials and offers guidance and 
financial support to get chapters started. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're still at the brainstorming stage," said Don Stikkers, district 
ranger of the Angeles Forest's Mt. Baldy district. Specifics of how the Natural 
Guard might work in Los Angeles have not been worked out. But Forest Service 
officials and educators such as Harold C. Haizlip of the Education Consortium 
of Central Los Angeles said they can easily foresee linking Angeles educational 
programs with the Natural Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Under their plans, the Angeles Forest would serve as a field laboratory for 
Natural Guard groups in communities and schools. If pilot programs work, the 
Forest Service officials said, they hope to copy it at the 155 other national 
forests throughout the country, particularly ones near urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
Making a connection with gang members or gang wanna-bes is not as difficult as 
it might seem, said Havens, who himself escaped the 1950s gang life of 
Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant. Nor, he said, is it hard to make a connection 
between the street-corner environment of vacant lots and the majesty of 
10,000-foot mountain peaks an hour from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the Natural Guard is to start in your own community," he said. The 
goal is "to bring up a generation with real information about the environment, 
for the first time in history."

SHOOTER AT SKEET RANGE WOUNDS 6 SPECTATORS; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: THE LA CRESCENTA MAN FIRED TOWARD THE GROUP WHILE TRACKING A FAULTY 
TARGET. 
</P>

Six people were injured when a gun enthusiast at a trap and skeet range in 
South El Monte accidentally fired his shotgun in the wrong direction, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Smith, 43, of La Crescenta, who was tracking a faulty target that broke 
in two as it was flung from a skeet tower, fired toward the group of spectators 
Tuesday at the Pachmayr International Shooting Sports Range, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had tracked the fragment of the clay target that flew toward the range's 
parking lot. Five men and a teen-ager were about 30 yards away from Smith, 
talking and watching the shooters, when they were hit by pellets from Smith's 
gun, Deputy John Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ismael Hurtado, 23, of Los Angeles was taken to a nearby hospital and treated 
for wounds to his face and neck. He was transfered to County-USC Medical 
Center, where he underwent surgery to repair damage to his left eye, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. He was in satisfactory condition Wednesday night, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Robles, 17, of El Monte suffered a neck wound and was taken to a local 
hospital, where he refused treatment and was released against the advice of 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The four others who were struck by pellets were treated at the scene by 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scott, general manager of the range, said that during instruction, 
shooters are cautioned against firing at broken targets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith was a regular at the range, which is located in the Whittier 
Narrows Recreation Area, Pachmayr officials said they could not comment on his 
skills as a shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"People who work here recognized him by face and by name," said Ron Plue, vice 
president of Pachmayr Ltd. "Exactly how experienced he is, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
David MacDonald, 50, of Rowland Heights, who frequents the range twice a week, 
said the accident surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always impressed by how safety-conscious the shooters and the workers are 
here," said MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't typical," he said, referring to the shooting, which sheriff's 
investigators determined was accidental. "I can't imagine someone goofing off 
here. It's just not a place to mess around."

3 MISSING WOMEN FOUND; DISAPPEARANCE WAS FAKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Three missing Rialto women whose bloodstained car was found abandoned in North 
Hollywood last week turned up safe in Utah Wednesday night and admitted that 
they faked their disappearance to get sympathy from their families, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all a hoax," Lt. John Zorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had suspected foul play in the disappearance of Suzanne Ballinger, 38, 
her 17-year-old daughter, Sherry Richards, and Richards' friend, Laura Fleming, 
18. They vanished last Thursday after leaving the Van Nuys print shop where 
Ballinger worked. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger's car was found Sunday in North Hollywood with "small amounts of 
blood" on the seat, said police, who launched a search for the women. 
</P>
<P>
But Ballinger's husband called police Wednesday night to say that all three 
were safe in Ogden, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"We subsequently made a call to a crisis counseling center in Ogden, Utah, and 
established that the women were safe, and had not been victims, and had 
perpetrated a hoax to generate sympathy for unspecified personal problems," 
Zorn said. 
</P>
<P>
The three admitted that the blood found in the car was Fleming's -- the result 
of a self-inflicted wound -- and that they had scattered the contents of their 
purses, Zorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe they left Los Angeles by bus Friday for Ogden, said Zorn. 
</P>
<P>
The three will not face charges, Zorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger was last seen about 11 p.m. last Thursday when she left her job as a 
typesetter, accompanied by her daughter and Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
According to a co-worker, Ballinger had complained of a headache. Rather than 
face the two-hour drive home to San Bernardino County, Ballinger told the 
co-worker she planned to check into a motel, as she sometimes did when she 
worked late. 
</P>
<P>
The three women never arrived at the motel. Ballinger's white 1987 Ford 
Thunderbird was found Sunday in the parking lot of an apartment complex about 
four miles from her office. The keys were still in the car, as were their 
purses, police said.

Open weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 
779-0880. Anchored in a strip mall, this may well be the "last of the 
neighborhood saloons," as management claims. There's lots of wood, a jukebox 
heavy on classic rock, and help that knows the regulars -- from suits to 
shirt-sleeves types -- by name. RICK VANDERKNYFF

<P>
They have OK Irish music here on the weekends; occasionally an exuberant patron 
takes the stage about closing time to work out on a Celtic folk song or two. 
Plus which, they put out a happy hour spread of Ritz crackers and tuna fish.

It's on the glitzy side, it tends to be crowded, the waitresses are a trifle 
slow and the drinks ain't cheap. But there's a great view of the harbor and the 
ferries that makes it all worthwhile. A fine place to park yourself on a Sunday

THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: PIZZA BY ANY OTHER NAME ISN'T AS GOOD AND CHEAP 
</P>

<P>
Zubie's? What kind of a name is that? 
</P>
<P>
It's a name that means great pizza at an excellent price, as the restaurant's 
many customers and owner John Zubietta would be quick to tell you. 
</P>
<P>
At Zubies, the pizzas come in one size only: large -- between 16 and 17 inches. 
And you can get them with all the toppings your stomach can handle -- 
pepperoni, anchovies, pineapple, you name it. And no matter how many of those 
toppings you choose, it will cost only $6.50 (plus tax) for the pie. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Zubie's is reasonably close to the beach, you won't find flimsy 
"beach" pizza here. The crust is thick and doughy, and they slather it with 
enough tomato sauce to make it nice and moist. This stuff is good, really good. 
</P>
<P>
Zubie's parking lot is always crowded. Once you enter the place and smell their 
pizza, you'll know why. The parlor is lined with picnic tables covered in 
red-and-white-checked tablecloths. It's noisy, since everyone is either playing 
pool or one of their favorite video games. If video games aren't your thing, 
you can always watch a ball game on one of the many television screens 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
If you also like to people-watch, Zubie's is your kind of place. The crowd is 
made up of all types, from yuppies to surfers, young children to senior 
citizens. But the most interesting characters are the occasional bikers who 
come in for a 32-ounce bottled beer and a game of pool. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get this Zubie's -- located inside the Gilded Cage Bar -- confused with 
Zubie's Restaurant, which happens to be next door and is owned by the same 
people. The restaurant serves seafood, while Zubie's Pizza mainly serves -- you 
guessed it -- pizza (though they also make spaghetti, submarines and 
antipasto-style salads). 
</P>
<P>
You won't find candles on the tables or cloth napkins here. But if you are 
looking for tasty pizza at a great price, this is the place for you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zubie's Pizza, 1714 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa. (No phone.) Open 11:30 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. LANA HAYS

PUC OKS ENERGY PLAN TIED TO CONSERVATION

The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a far-reaching 
energy conservation program that backers said would forestall the need to build 
new power plants and reassert the state's leadership in energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Financed by the state's four largest electric and natural gas utilities through 
short-term rate increases of less than 1%, the two-year, $560-million program 
would effectively double the amount of money spent by the companies on 
conservation efforts. Over the longer term, utility rates might decline through 
energy savings, the PUC said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan -- formulated during months of behind-the-scenes negotiations -- 
the four utilities would be allowed to declare as profits part of the savings 
that result from greater energy conversation by their commercial and 
residential customers. In the past the PUC has set a ceiling on utility profits 
that does not account for energy-saving programs. The companies have had little 
financial incentive to promote conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the progam would be to increase rebates for nearly 20 million 
utility customers who buy energy-efficient appliances and other energy-saving 
products. Home builders would be given additional incentives to construct 
energy-saving dwellings that exceed state energy conservation standards. 
Conservation programs would also be aimed at commercial, industrial and 
agriculture customers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important state regulatory decision I've ever witnessed," 
said Ralph Cavanagh, energy program manager for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, which helped devise the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It has the potential to change the fundamental nature of the utility business. 
. . . For the first time in the state's history, utility profits are being tied 
in part to their success in promoting energy savings as opposed to their 
success in building and operating power plants." 
</P>
<P>
Utilities participating in the program are the Southern California Edison Co., 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., Southern California Gas Co. and Pacific Gas 
&amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The program comes at a time of resurgent national interest in energy 
conservation in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis that has threatened world 
oil markets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that the timing couldn't be more propitious," state PUC 
President G. Mitchell Wilk said. "What has happened to fuel costs newly reminds 
all of us in a very stark way the importance of conservation." 
</P>
<P>
The program was ordered by the PUC after a study by the natural resources 
council found that California utilities had slashed conservation programs in 
half since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year, the conservation program will save 250 megawatts of 
electricity at half the cost of building a new power plant capable of 
generating that much energy. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. said Wednesday its spending on energy 
conservation would double over the next two years to $63 million. The 
additional money will be used to expand a direct assistance program to 
low-income customers that provides them with free energy-efficient equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Edison said it will also increase its rebate program for customers who buy 
energy-saving appliances and other equipment. All but $4 million of the more 
than $30 million in additional annual spending will be earmarked for rebate 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also offer home builders financial incentives to build houses 
that exceed existing state energy conservation standards by 10% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials said they expected customer rate increases to be less than 
one-tenth of 1% in 1990, and 0.14% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said one serious weakness in the PUC program is the decision to leave 
largely unchanged the utilities' promotion of simple attic insulation and 
weatherstripping for existing homes -- a 1970s-era approach that offers only 
minor energy savings. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hall, an energy conservation consultant, had lobbied the PUC to support a 
technique known as "super-weatherization," used successfully in several states 
and Canada throughout the 1980s, which typically cuts household heating and 
cooling bills by 35% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"They are relying on attic insulation again and some weatherstripping and 
that's garbage -- that's 20-year-old nonsense," Hall said. "Millions of 
California homes need far greater corrections because they are 
energy-guzzlers." 
</P>
<P>
Cavanagh insisted, however, that even super-weatherization is possible under 
the new program. "Where the program goes in the long haul remains to be 
determined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co. expects to spend $39 million during the next two 
years. One new rebate program calls for replacing old, inefficient generators, 
motors and other equipment used by industrial customers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. proposes to spend $19.5 million in 1991 on 
energy efficiency, resulting in a 2.6% rate increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
PG&amp;E will spend $102.8 million, and plans no rate increases this year, but 
a $38.7 million increase in electric rates and a $500,000 increase in gas rates 
to take effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental program will be monitored by the PUC during the next two years 
to measure its effectiveness and assess the need for further changes. It is 
expected to become final after a 25-day public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Studies last year revealed that California's big utilities had quietly slashed 
their energy-conservation programs by half after years of leading the nation in 
energy efficiency. The studies prompted environmental groups to pressure the 
California Public Utilities Commission to support a turnaround. The groups 
warned that increased burning of fossil fuels at power plants could increase 
global warming, worsen urban smog and threaten California's economic 
competitiveness with nations such as Japan.

IRAQ PREPARES TO FREE HOSTAGES AFTER DELAY; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS ARE BLAMED. ABOUT 250 AMERICAN WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO LEAVE.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government Wednesday laid the groundwork for releasing hundreds of 
foreign women and children, among them about 250 Americans, but diplomats said 
President Saddam Hussein's decision Tuesday night to free them was so sudden 
that logistical problems delayed their departure. 
</P>
<P>
Most are expected to leave today. Sources in Iraq's Information Ministry said a 
ceremony is scheduled this morning for the foreign media to meet some of the 
departing hostages, whom Hussein had said he was holding in Iraq as "guests" to 
discourage attack by Western forces. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from nearly a dozen countries that have sent military forces to the 
Persian Gulf -- and whose citizens have been held here since Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2 -- spent much of the day with Foreign Ministry officials in 
Baghdad attempting to organize an orderly departure. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, considerable confusion about precisely who would be 
permitted to leave. It was unclear whether Hussein's announcement covered women 
and children in Kuwait or just those in Iraq and whether it included women with 
no children here as well as mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreigners in Kuwait are reportedly in hiding, and U.S. officials 
said they do not know how many of the estimated 2,500 Americans there are women 
and children. They said "around 250" of the more than 500 Americans in Iraq 
will be covered by the order. It also will include at least 700 Britons in 
Iraq, as well as scores of French, Germans, Italians and other Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
The logistics of moving so many people also bogged down the process. At least 
one international air carrier, Virgin Airways of Britain, offered to run mercy 
flights to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, state-owned Iraqi Airways was the only commercial airline 
flying into or out of Baghdad, and its only regular flights were between 
Baghdad, Kuwait and Amman, Jordan. In Amman, two Iraqi passenger jets arrived 
during the day, but neither carried foreign women and children. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said Iraq will release male 
hostages, as well, if the United States pledges not to attack Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have permitted women and children of all nationalities to leave if they 
wish to leave," he said Wednesday. "Once America gives us assurances that they 
are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq, or aggress upon Iraq, then we 
are going to let even men out." 
</P>
<P>
Mashat asserted that Baghdad cannot be blamed for the delays in freeing the 
women and children. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible administratively that everyone go on the same day, is it?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler characterized Hussein's 
announcement as a significant step "if implemented." 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard statements like this before, and we hope Saddam Hussein will 
have the human decency to live up to his word," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She rebuffed Mashat's proposal about the male hostages, saying, "We reject any 
notion that there should be any conditions attached to the immediate safe 
departure of all foreign nationals. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad said Wednesday night that they still had not 
met with the more than 41 Americans who are known to have been taken to key 
Iraqi strategic sites up to 10 days ago, although they said they expect to do 
so today. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I think the bureaucracy is trying to interpret the president's 
order and work out the difficult logistics involved in getting all these people 
together and getting them out," one diplomatic source said. "It certainly seems 
to have been a spur-of-the-moment decision (by Hussein)." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi pressure on foreign diplomats and civilians continued, 
American, French and Japanese diplomats reported. At least nine Americans are 
missing and believed seized by Iraqi security agents in the last two days, and 
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said 40 more French citizens 
have been rounded up in Baghdad. Bernard said authorities in Paris do not know 
where they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Western officials estimate that more than 300 of the more than 12,000 citizens 
of Western nations who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait have been taken from 
their homes and hotel rooms by Iraqi forces. Hussein's government says some 
will be housed at vulnerable military targets as a "human shield" against 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported Wednesday that their last two diplomats 
abandoned their embassy in Kuwait. Without food, water or electricity since 
Saturday, the ambassador and his top aide left for Baghdad. But the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry insisted that "in principle, the embassy remains open." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait remained defiant, with skeleton 
staffs, as did more than 25 other European, Arab and Asian embassies, despite 
Iraq's attempts to force them to shut down and move their operations to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the daylong confusion in Baghdad on Wednesday, there were a few lighter 
moments. The Italian hostages, for example -- who were made available for 
television interviews from their hotel rooms in Baghdad -- were all instructed 
to report to the cultural center of their embassy, where they were shown the 
film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" while awaiting further word from Iraqi 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the Iraqi capital said there appeared to be several reasons for 
Hussein's announcement concerning the release, which occurred less than an hour 
after an internationally televised meeting between the president and a group of 
Western hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Several Western and Asian diplomats said they believe Hussein felt genuine 
sympathy for the hostages. Yet, most added that the surprise announcement also 
appeared to be a shrewd political move to gain a higher moral ground before 
today's scheduled meeting in Jordan between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz 
and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the crisis talks, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
insisted that there is no room for mediation. 
</P>
<P>
Winding up a two-day state visit to Finland, Thatcher, who has been unbending 
on the basic issues of the Persian Gulf confrontation, told reporters that the 
U.N. Security Council resolutions "were clear and must be enforced." These 
resolutions demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and empower foreign forces to 
do whatever it takes to block supplies to Iraq. "The policy has been laid down 
by the Security Council. . . . The question is implementation," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking an even harder line was Bahrain's foreign minister, Sheik Mohammed ibn 
Mubarak al Khalifa. Speaking to British reporters with touring Defense 
Secretary Tom King, the Bahraini sheik declared: "What we want now is a free 
Kuwait. . . . We have the right to defend it, and the military option is open 
because others do not want to listen to withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Bahrain, whose government 10 days ago approved deployment of 
Western forces on its soil, have supported the U.N. stand, but the foreign 
minister's remarks, as reported on British television, were unusually tough. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be action to liberate Kuwait," he said. "We will not let Kuwait be 
occupied for long. . . . If the sanctions do not materialize, we have the 
legitimate right to regain Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Although the exodus of hostages did not materialize Wednesday, Asian and Arab 
refugees from Kuwait and Iraq continued to pour across the border into Jordan. 
At Ruweished, the frontier crossing, the Jordanian government set up a tent 
city on an asphalt parking lot, and hundreds of impoverished workers sought 
shelter from the blazing sun while awaiting transportation to Amman -- and, 
with luck, an airplane home. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian citizens, the most numerous group, generally were whisked away by bus 
to the southern port of Aqaba for an airlift or ferry back to Egypt. But a host 
of refugees heading for the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan 
and Indonesia were kept waiting because a backlog of compatriots has built up 
in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been here for four days, and no one tells me what to do," said Doy 
Gutierrez, a Filipino laborer who worked in Kuwait for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Food is scarce in Ruweished although health problems have been surprisingly few 
-- mostly heatstroke. Water is being provided from a hose at the immigration 
crossing and by tank truck inside a neutral zone where hundreds more refugees 
are waiting passage into Jordan. In this no-man's-land, the Jordanians have 
also set up tent cities to protect the refugees from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
At Saudi Arabia's coastal-road border crossing with Kuwait, guards said 
Wednesday that they had received no word of the new Iraqi announcement on 
releasing foreign hostages. The border post, which a month ago waved as many as 
3,000 cars and trucks through its gates per day, remained desolate as 
foreigners inside Kuwait stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
At the frontier's final checkpoint, four Saudi soldiers in desert camouflage 
manned a 50-caliber machine gun mounted on a Chevy truck, and a number of 
green-suited border guards watched through binoculars for signs of life across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
There was little movement there, and no foreign hostages arrived. But a band of 
Bangladeshis sitting in the shade of the border house told reporters that their 
group arrived Monday, after surviving a seven-hour flight on foot across the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
According to the group's leader, 25-year-old Mohammed Nasser, Iraqi soldiers 
had robbed and plundered their homes in the diamond-shaped "neutral zone" along 
the Saudi-Iraqi border, where they were employed as farm laborers. 
</P>
<P>
As they fled, the Bangladeshis were stopped by Iraqi soldiers in trucks 
demanding food and water, Nasser said. When some young farmers said they had 
none, Nasser said the Iraqis turned their machine guns on seven, apparently 
killing all. 
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshis were awaiting the arrival of their country's diplomatic 
representative.

GORBACHEV HOLDS KREMLIN SUMMIT WITH YELTSIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Russian leader Boris N. Yeltsin held 
a virtual Kremlin summit meeting Wednesday to hammer out a common approach to 
the nation's economic problems and reached evident consensus on a sweeping 
devolution of powers to the republics. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest chapter of their long, tempestuous relationship, the Soviet 
Union's two most powerful political figures -- who clashed as recently as last 
week -- met for more than three hours with an agenda that Gorbachev's spokesman 
said included 50 items, from domestic to world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Both leaders spoke to Soviet television reporters during a break in their 
unprecedented talks, and Gorbachev, who looked wan and weary alongside the 
strapping Siberian populist, said the main purpose of the get-together was "to 
unite the efforts of all social forces" who favor reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to exclude the influence of those crazy ultras from the right and the 
left," Gorbachev said. "The rest of the forces of society have to be 
consolidated." 
</P>
<P>
On TV, both leaders were civil to a fault, although there was an obvious 
stiffness and lack of warmth between the Soviet president and Yeltsin, the 
president of the Russian federation, who is now the country's most popular 
elected politician but who was fired in disgrace as Moscow's Communist Party 
boss by Gorbachev in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I may express a certain sorrow that such a capital meeting has been postponed, 
maybe by mutual fault of ours," Yeltsin said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say, we do not have either political or human problems or obstacles for 
us to peacefully discuss all issues," added Gorbachev, stressing their ability 
to work together. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Gorbachev and Yeltsin joined to create a group of 
economists charged with writing a common plan on the transition to a market 
economy for the Soviet Union and for Russia, which makes up two-thirds of the 
nation. It was a radical alternative to the more traditionalist blueprint 
offered by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, which sparked panic in June 
because of its proposals for a doubling in food prices. 
</P>
<P>
The economists' panel has given itself until Saturday to come up with its final 
plan, and Yeltsin endorsed their work, evidently speaking for Gorbachev as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The group has worked out good proposals, to our minds," Yeltsin said. "These 
are radical measures and more resolute actions." 
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would be submitted at today's meeting in Moscow of the 
Presidential and Federation councils, two advisory bodies headed by Gorbachev, 
and then would be sent to the legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics within a 
week for their comments. 
</P>
<P>
"After this, as the finale of the program's development, an economic treaty 
between the republics and the (Soviet) president should be signed," Yeltsin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gorbachev gave no details but said: "The time has come when we 
have to summarize and put forward a uniform document. In a week's time, the 
program will be completed." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's new spokesman told a news conference that sweeping changes were in 
the offing, but he was no more explicit than his boss. "I would like to tell 
you that we're on the threshold of a major decision, a real change in the 
economic structures and relations of the union itself," said Vitaly N. 
Ignatenko, whose appointment was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported that the economists' commission, 
which has been meeting in a dacha near Moscow, is proposing the "creation of an 
economic union of sovereign republics" as a way of solving economic problems 
and curtailing ethnic strife and nationalist demands. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a major departure from the top-heavy centralization of the past 
and would meet demands from republic-level leaders such as Yeltsin for home 
rule and local control over natural resources. According to an independent 
Moscow business weekly, Commersant, Ryzhkov has said the plan could lead to the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
According to Izvestia, the plan would freeze certain basic food prices during 
the initial stage of what Yeltsin's allies have outlined as a 500-day process. 
Although other prices would be allowed to float to their market level, wages 
would be indexed to cushion the impact of inflation. A rapid privatization of 
property would also be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission's plan is adopted, Ryzhkov's political future will become dim 
indeed. His plan was rejected by the Soviet Parliament almost three months ago, 
and he has been given until September to revise it and resubmit it. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman, Russian Information Minister Mikhail N. Poltoranin, 
predicted that Wednesday's meeting would doom Ryzhkov's chances: "'The Ryzhkov 
program is suffocating, and his song is sung," Poltoranin said by telephone. 
But he made it clear that Yeltsin will pursue his brand of economic reform for 
Russia whatever decision is made by the central government. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gorbachev refuses to accept the 500-day program, Russia will certainly pass 
it, and this will be a very serious conflict," Poltoranin said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting was only the latest page in the oddest Soviet political 
relationship in recent years, but one particular televised exchange showed the 
gap that still separates the men, despite their attempt to find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
As they stood side by side discussing their negotiations, Gorbachev said, "The 
cornerstone should be the interests of perestroika, of renewal of the country, 
the interests of our people." 
</P>
<P>
"But not to the detriment of the sovereignty and interests of Russia," 
interjected Yeltsin, who only last week rejected a Gorbachev decree ordering 
Russia to accept the central government's control over its natural resources.

BUSH'S AIDES DIVIDED OVER IRAQ SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, faced with increasingly pointed questions from Congress on his 
Persian Gulf policy, is also grappling with divisions among his own advisers 
over whether the United States must ultimately destroy the military and 
political power of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of congressional uneasiness and internal division could spell 
trouble for the President, who will soon face pivotal decisions even though the 
confrontation with Iraq appears to have entered a temporary lull. 
</P>
<P>
One senior government official, who believes the back of Hussein's military 
power must be broken, said that even if Iraq were to withdraw from Kuwait, "You 
can't leave him there with all his capacity for mischief and say the problem 
has been dealt with. The President feels very strongly about this." 
</P>
<P>
Yet other key Administration officials, among them National Security Adviser 
Brent Scowcroft and some senior State Department officials, have suggested that 
-- under some circumstances -- simply driving Iraq from Kuwait might constitute 
a tolerable resolution of the crisis. The regional balance of power has already 
shifted against the Iraqi leader because of the broad alliance of nations 
arrayed against him, Scowcroft has said publicly. 
</P>
<P>
With Bush publicly undeclared on this fundamental policy issue, the dispute is 
also mirrored in Congress, raising the prospect that the United States might be 
headed into a prolonged military operation without a guiding vision as to what 
its objectives should be. 
</P>
<P>
At least one senior Administration official said in an interview that Bush's 
inner circle has, in fact, reached a general consensus that the threat to U.S. 
interests will not end until Hussein is ousted from power. 
</P>
<P>
But with the crucial decisions yet to come, the unresolved questions about 
specific American war aims leave uncertain whether the crisis will be resolved 
through compromise, dictated peace terms or only the use of force -- even if 
Iraq pulls back inside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement that "whatever happens, we've got to win," a senior 
Administration official said Wednesday. But, he added, "not everybody agrees 
exactly on what winning is." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that Hussein has to get out of Kuwait," a ranking State 
Department official said. "But beyond that, there is some disagreement. The 
question now is whether there should be a specific goal of getting him out of 
power -- or at least leaving his army crippled." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said discussions to date have been amiable, and they generally 
declined to characterize the views put forward by particular advisers to the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
They indicated, however, that Scowcroft has taken a consistently dovish line, 
arguing that the United States need not overthrow Hussein and could contain his 
power through a continued U.S. military commitment to the region, perhaps 
bolstered by a U.N. peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum are high-ranking officials in the Pentagon and 
the intelligence community, who have argued that the peace and security of the 
Middle East will remain in jeopardy as long as Hussein, with his military 
arsenal, is in control. 
</P>
<P>
"My own assessment is that he can't remain with all his armored units and air 
force," a senior U.S. official said. "And his chemical warfare capability has 
got to be dismantled or destroyed -- it's a sitting time bomb." 
</P>
<P>
"Even if he pulls out of Kuwait, he still has a million men," added a U.S. 
military officer involved in planning the gulf operation. "Saddam has to go, 
and so does his army. . . . And if the (Iraqi) military doesn't remove Saddam, 
we will." 
</P>
<P>
To date, the declared objectives of the massive U.S. Operation Desert Shield 
remain minimal. Bush has demanded only that Iraq pull out of Kuwait and release 
all foreign hostages, and that the ousted emir of Kuwait be restored to power. 
</P>
<P>
If attacked, Administration officials have warned, the United States would 
respond with massive force, almost certainly striking at targets deep within 
Iraq. They have also made no attempt to disguise their hope that the economic 
squeeze on Iraq might persuade Hussein's subordinates to overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
What remains undefined is whether the United States would be satisfied with an 
outcome that simply restored the status quo. Asked in a private meeting with 
congressmen this week to define his vital objectives, Bush repeatedly demurred. 
</P>
<P>
But in what lawmakers said they regarded as an important sign that some would 
be willing to tolerate such a settlement, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
indicated that the U.S. policy would aim at creating a regional "balance of 
authority" to contain Hussein and his army. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the answer suggested agreement with arguments put forward within 
the Administration by Scowcroft, who has warned the President that it could be 
dangerous to attempt to overthrow Hussein directly, and expressed confidence 
that sufficient power could be mustered to restrain him. 
</P>
<P>
In the most extensive public airing of that viewpoint, Scowcroft indicated in a 
television interview last weekend that the United States could accept a 
situation that left Hussein in power. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go back to the status quo ante in terms of Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, 
and the leadership back in Kuwait, and hostages released," Scowcroft said, 
"there will still be a fundamentally different situation in that area. 
Collective action will have been shown to work against a case of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, however, Robert H. Kimmitt, the undersecretary of state, 
offered a far less sanguine assessment of whether such an outcome would be 
tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
In what some sources said was representative of a view pressed more forcefully 
within the Administration by Pentagon and intelligence officials, Kimmitt said 
the United States "would certainly take those steps that are necessary to 
ensure that oil would continue to flow freely." 
</P>
<P>
"What the United States and the rest of the world community needs to do," 
Kimmitt added, "is to ensure that Iraq does not pose a threat, either to its 
neighbors or, in a broader sense, to people throughout the region." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, Administration officials familiar with the discussions said 
the argument has been made more starkly. "To leave Saddam in power would be one 
more walk away for our track record," a senior government official said. "We're 
not big for turning the world into flames, but this is a real watershed." 
</P>
<P>
The official indicated that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had expressed 
sympathy for this view, in large part out of concern about the long-term burden 
that a containment operation would place on the military. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wrestling with the time factor," the official said, "trying to determine 
how long we can go there and sit this out without it eroding our military 
capability." 
</P>
<P>
And inside the Pentagon, a number of high-ranking officials expressed the firm 
conviction that no solution that leaves Hussein in power is acceptable. "It's 
taken as a given -- Saddam must go," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
In a further complicating factor, one hawkish official dismissed contrasting 
formulations as part of an Administration effort to "make the best of a bad 
picture" and diminish public expectations of what the United States might gain 
from the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With such lack of specificity at the top, some in Congress are clearly losing 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
Some congressional leaders said in interviews this week that they see no need 
for the President to telegraph his intentions. "Everyone's trying to push him 
over the edge," said Rep. Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.), chairman of the House 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But in another view that is clearly gaining strength, other members made clear 
in their closed-door meeting with the President that they expect a more 
specific definition of what the United States expects to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"The deepest concern was that there be as fine an explanation of our presence 
there as can be produced," said Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.). 
</P>
<P>
There have been clear indications, however, that legislators may be as divided 
as the Administration in defining what American objectives in the Persian Gulf 
crisis should be. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the hard-line view is a sizable, bipartisan group of senators that is 
led by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), the Senate's most respected foreign 
policy analyst. They argue that the necessary end must be to remove Saddam 
Hussein from power -- even it if means a direct U.S. military strike on 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to come up with a strategy to remove Saddam Hussein," Sen. Richard 
C. Shelby (D-Ala.), who agrees with Lugar, said Wednesday. "If we don't, we are 
going to have a real monster on our hands. . . . If he stays in power, the 
Administration loses." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the powerful chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee. Nunn, who visited Saudi Arabia earlier this week, told a 
group of senators and congressmen in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on Wednesday that 
the United States ought to aim only at defending Saudi Arabia from an Iraqi 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Our military mission is to defend Saudi Arabia," Nunn told his colleagues.

GOVERNOR ASSAILS GRAY DAVIS, HONIG ON SCHOOL FUNDING

While appearing to come close to agreement with legislative leaders on school 
financing in private negotiations Wednesday, Gov. George Deukmejian publicly 
exchanged insults with state Controller Gray Davis and Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig. 
</P>
<P>
In uncharacteristically harsh language, the governor said Davis engaged in 
"shameless media showboating" when he decided Tuesday to pay California school 
districts the full 4.8% cost-of-living increase voted by the Legislature, 
instead of the 3% level that was included in the governor's final budget. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian warned local school superintendents that they risk running out of 
money sometime next spring if they spend all of the money that now is flowing 
from the controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time the state controller spent a little less time honing his press 
releases and media sound bites (and) spent a little more time reading the 
budget bill and the state Constitution, and living up to his oath of office to 
support and defend the Constitution," the angry governor stated. 
</P>
<P>
Davis shot back, "If the governor wants to engage in personal attacks, I'll be 
happy to go behind the barn with him." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also angered Honig by claiming that the state schools chief agreed 
to a 3% cost-of-living increase for schools when the two met to discuss the 
1990-91 budget last January. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely false," Honig said. "When you get these people in a corner, 
they just lie." 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the governor had agreed last year, during discussions about how to 
implement Proposition 98, that he would first provide enough money for a full 
cost-of-living hike and then use any extra money for class size reduction and 
other educational improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, he's violated that agreement" in several ways "and now he has the 
gall to suggest that I volunteered" to accept a 3% cost-of-living adjustment, 
Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
While all this shouting and name-calling was going on in public, Sens. Gary K. 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills) and Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale) were working quietly with the governor's office, trying to 
work out a school funding compromise. 
</P>
<P>
These are the elements of the compromise, as described by members of both 
parties and by legislative aides involved in the negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
The COLA would remain at 3%. 
</P>
<P>
However, the governor would free up about $150 million of the $462 million he 
set aside when he signed the budget July 31 and this money would be sent to 
school districts immediately, on a per-student basis. This money would be part 
of the schools' funding base, not one-time money. This had been a major 
disagreement between the governor and education groups. 
</P>
<P>
Another $150 million would be sent to school districts next spring, if budget 
conditions permit, again on a per-student basis. 
</P>
<P>
For class size reduction, $220 million would be spent but schools would have 
considerable flexibility in spending at least half of this money. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the groups in the education coalition that has been negotiating with 
the governor and the Legislature indicated a grudging willingness to accept 
this compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But Honig, whose feud with Deukmejian is deep and personal, and the powerful 
California Teachers Assn. object to the compromise because it retains the 
governor's 3% increase.

ALCOHOL TAX FOES CLAIM PROPONENTS ARE HIDDEN

In the latest maneuver in a struggle over the airwaves, alcoholic beverage 
interests have accused the promoters of a beer, wine and liquor tax increase 
proposal Wednesday of airing commercials that fail to disclose their major 
financial backers as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the industry-financed Taxpayers for Common Sense, which has been 
fighting to keep the promoters of Proposition 134 from getting free air time, 
made the accusation in a complaint filed with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and then sent copies of it by overnight mail to the state's radio 
stations. Proposition 134 would substantially increase taxes on alcoholic 
beverages and dedicate revenue from the tax hike to programs for the treatment 
of drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In a cover letter hinting that stations should reject the ads offered by 
supporters of the November ballot measure, San Francisco lawyer Barry Fadem 
said Californians for Yes on 134 had "clearly crossed the line" and were 
violating the state's truth-in-initiative-advertisement law. 
</P>
<P>
Fadem said radio spots name the group's major funding source as "the California 
chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians," when campaign reports 
show that its biggest financial backer is really a political committee called 
"Five PAC." 
</P>
<P>
Fadem said in an interview he suspected that the proponents of the November 
ballot measure were trying to name a funding source that would elicit a 
favorable reaction from the public rather than one which is relatively unknown. 
Five PAC gets its funds from a variety of sources, including hospitals and 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the Yes on 134 campaign said they believe that their commercials 
comply with the law and that Fadem's complaint is another attempt by the 
industry to pressure radio and television stations to deny them free commercial 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Reynolds, campaign director for the Yes on 134 forces, said that the 
emergency room physicians group was a contributor to Five PAC and campaign 
officials thought that disclosing that group's name would be more meaningful to 
voters than the name of a political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the real issue is whether we are complying with the law," 
Reynolds said. "The issue is what can they do to (stop) the radio stations from 
doing what they have done in the past. I don't think there has ever been such a 
concrete effort by multinational corporations to deny citizen interests access 
to the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group is asking for free air time under the Federal Communications 
Commission's fairness doctrine, a regulation that requires broadcasters to 
ensure that they give balanced coverage to controversial issues of public 
importance. When one side of an issue has the resources to purchase advertising 
and the other does not, stations can correct the imbalance through public 
affairs programming, news coverage or by offering to run free advertising. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent acknowledgment that radio and television is the key to a 
November victory, the two sides in the Proposition 134 contest have drawn their 
battle lines in the corporate offices of the state's radio and television 
stations. Californians for Yes on 134 are pushing broadcasters to give them 
free air time while their rival, Taxpayers for Common Sense, is threatening to 
cancel its political advertising with any station that gives the free time. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Fair Political Practices Commission said the agency will 
review the complaint by Taxpayers for Common Sense to see if it has merit.

SUNLIGHT GATHERED UP AS A TOOL OF THE FUTURE

Remember the mean little kid who used to set fire to scraps of paper with a 
magnifying glass and a little help from the sun? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he's back, but this time he's a lot better armed. 
</P>
<P>
Applying state-of-the-art technology to that old trick has enabled scientists 
in Southern California and Illinois to begin harnessing the sun's light and 
heat in ways that could have many diverse applications in the future. In the 
latest step, announced today, University of Chicago scientists report that they 
have produced the highest intensity of sunlight found anywhere in the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The advancing technology could be used to rapidly send large amounts of data 
between orbiting satellites, to zap toxic substances on Earth with such 
intensity that they would be rendered harmless, or even to melt the soil on the 
surface of the moon for use in building landing pads and radiation shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of sunlight by the Chicago team was 15% higher than on the 
surface of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"We even beat the sun," said physicist Dave Cooke, lead author of a report in 
today's issue of the British scientific journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
By using a small mirror and a "collector" that funnels sunlight into an intense 
beam, the Chicago team concentrated sunlight to 84,000 times its normal 
intensity on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, teams of researchers in California have built a huge solar collector 
that concentrates sunlight so intensely that if it were on the moon it could 
melt the soil on the lunar surface. Laboratory experiments show that the 
process would produce shiny black glass that could be used to manufacture 
composite materials for construction projects on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The giant collector, which uses 82 mirrors of one square meter each, has 
produced temperatures of 2,200 to 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit, according to 
engineers with McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. of Huntington Beach. The 
collector was built by the firm in the early 1980s to use the sun's power to 
produce electricity, but it was abandoned when the price of oil plummeted later 
that decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it has been called back into service at the height of another 
Middle East crisis -- but for a very different reason. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers with the firm have teamed up with ALCOA/Golds-worth Engineering of 
Torrance and the Space Studies Institute of Princeton, N.J., to see if the huge 
collector could be used to help astronauts build structures they will need on 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to learn more about design and application, to see if we can 
simplify it," said John Garvey, project manager at McDonnell Douglas. Garvey 
believes it might be possible to build a solar collector that could be 
transported to the moon and used there to melt soil into fibers and glass 
"bricks" that could be used in construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of this is that all your material is on the moon," and that could 
reduce the need to transport construction materials from Earth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Solar energy could be used more efficiently on the moon than on Earth because 
the absence of a lunar atmosphere would allow 40% more sunlight to reach the 
collectors, the engineers said. And since there is no wind, support facilities 
could be much lighter than on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers tested their concept using simulated lunar soil supplied by the 
Princeton group. When subjected to intense heat, it melted into glass, Garvey 
said. Since the temperatures were so high, special crucibles to hold the molten 
"glass" were supplied by the Torrance firm. 
</P>
<P>
"You could even make forks and spoons (or almost anything else the astronauts 
would need) if you have the right molds" to pour the glass into, said engineer 
Mike Magoffin. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers came up with the idea after President Bush called for building a 
permanent station on the moon, a feat that most experts believe can best be 
done if lunar materials are used for much of the construction. 
</P>
<P>
Congress recently eliminated funds from the current budget for the President's 
"Space Exploration Initiative," of which the lunar outpost is a part, but the 
White House is still pushing the project. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the University of Chicago are more down to Earth in their work, 
but it is just about as far out. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the huge McDonnell Douglas facility, the Chicago team uses an ordinary 
telescope mirror of 16-inch diameter. The parabolic mirror reflects sunlight 
into a narrow beam that passes through a "concentrator," which is just a 
"funnel for light," Cooke said during a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The funnel, which is a precisely machined cone of pure sapphire, bends the 
incoming light rays as they reflect off its sides, thus concentrating it 
further. Sapphire was picked because it has a high refractive index, or ability 
to bend light, that is so great that it does not even have to be coated with a 
reflective material. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a highly efficient solar collector, according to the University 
of Chicago's Roland Winston, chairman of the physics department, who pioneered 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, the researchers tested their equipment atop the physics building. 
The solar collector generated 72 watts per square millimeter of surface. 
Sunlight reaching Earth normally generates less than one-thousandth of a watt 
per square millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said such an intense beam could be used as a "solar pumped laser," thus 
generating a concentrated beam of light that would be so powerful it could 
break down toxic wastes. In space, the beam of light could be used as a carrier 
to transmit immense amounts of data between communications satellites, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The technology could also be used to generate extremely high temperatures for 
processing materials, similar to what the Southern California researchers have 
in mind for the surface of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the technology could also be used to generate electricity, thus 
easing demand for foreign oil, the researchers said. That idea was abandoned 
earlier when the price of oil dropped, but Garvey said that concept could be 
resurrected. 
</P>

HIGH NUMBER OF LEAD POISON CASES FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: STATE STUDIES SHOW MANY WORKERS EXPOSED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. 
MONITORING PRACTICES IN INDUSTRY ARE CRITICIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lead poisoning has been found in surprisingly high numbers of California 
workers, particularly in high-risk industries in Los Angeles, two state studies 
have revealed. 
</P>
<P>
In articles published in this month's issue of the American Journal of Public 
Health, officials at the state Department of Health Services report finding 
excessive lead exposure to workers in a handful of high-risk occupations, 
noting that monitoring practices to detect lead in the workplace environment 
are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Under a state law effective Jan. 1, 1987, state medical laboratories performing 
tests for levels of lead in blood have been required to report the findings to 
the Department of Health Services. In one study of those cases, at least 5,000 
workers were found to have elevated blood lead levels that were, in some cases, 
near toxic. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that most of the exposed individuals were male and a 
disproportionate percentage, 44%, Latino. The study showed that 81% were 
residents of Los Angeles County, where many manufacturing processes using lead 
are based. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the individuals were workers for lead smelters, battery manufacturers 
and brass foundries. Construction, radiator repair, pottery and ceramics 
manufacturing and firing ranges accounted for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the workers were not in routine medical monitoring programs. 
</P>
<P>
In the second study by researchers at the state's Occupational Health Program, 
only 2.6% of lead-using industries in the state reported they have done 
environmental monitoring for lead and only 1.4% have done routine biological 
monitoring programs. 
</P>
<P>
In a third, unpublished study, tests showed at least 2,500 California children 
have potentially toxic levels of lead in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more of a problem than people thought there was," said Dr. Kenneth 
Kizer, state health director. "The biggest problem is the awareness, getting 
doctors to test kids and think about it as a potential issue. You have to test 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
As for workplace exposure, laws designed by the U.S. Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to protect workers from lead exposure have been 
overlooked, said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New 
York, in an editorial accompanying the articles. 
</P>
<P>
"Lead remains a serious problem in American workplaces," Landirgan said. "These 
reported numbers, disturbing as they are, appear to represent but a fraction of 
the total problem, inasmuch as only 1.4% of lead-using industries in California 
have developed biological monitoring programs for their lead-exposed workers." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of monitoring among California industries suggests that cases of 
occupational lead poisoning may be seriously underestimated, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the workplace the problem is ignorance," Kizer said. "It's not 
knowing the laws, on the part of workers and operators. Where you're seeing 
problems is not with the big companies, it's with the smaller operations where 
you don't have the focus on health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
In larger facilities, monitoring was more prominent. "The problem is big, but 
varies by industry, with the larger, unionized companies more likely to have 
monitoring programs," said Dr. Jon Rosenberg of the Occupational Health 
Surveillance and Evaluation Program. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 80% of battery manufacturing employees work in job classifications that 
have been monitored, compared to only 1% of radiator repair workers. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Landrigan, "the number of OSHA inspectors in the field must be 
increased. These inspectors must be allowed to levy severe fines for repeated 
or willful violations. Criminal penalties must be used much more frequently 
than heretofore to punish repeated and willful violators." 
</P>
<P>
According to Kizer, standards for lead exposure have been changed in recent 
years as research showed that lower levels than previously expected can cause 
neurological damage. Few studies have looked at potentially dangerous lead 
exposure using the new, more sensitive criteria for toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't totally surprised by what we found, but by the same token, we 
didn't have a basis for knowing what it should be," Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the studies are surprising because lead poisoning is traditionally viewed 
as a problem in the Northeastern part of the United States where many 
industries using lead are based and where older homes contain lead-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to know if California residents have any greater risk to lead 
exposure than other states because the California studies used the more 
sensitive levels for lead exposure, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, lead exposure can be easily reduced by enforcement of OSHA 
regulations. Among children, most lead exposure comes from living near 
industries using lead or from lead-based paint in homes.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq officially told the United States that it will let all foreign women and 
children leave its soil. But Iraq also hedged its promise to release them by 
Wednesday, saying all could not be processed at once, and the State Department 
cautioned against counting on Iraqi promises. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Officials began their investigation of the crash of a Persian Gulf-bound 
military transport that killed 13 servicemen. Meanwhile, President Bush told 
U.S. soldiers in a radio address that they are "more than a match for a 
tyrant." 
</P>

World stock markets were mixed Wednesday. Asian exchanges retreated, apparently 
suffering from renewed concerns about the Middle East. But Frankfurt and Wall

MIDEAST: BUT TOKYO REBUFFS U.S. REQUESTS FOR A NAVAL PRESENCE OR NON-COMBAT 
MILITARY PERSONNEL.

<P>
After nearly a month of procrastination, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu 
on Wednesday announced a carefully limited package of financial and other 
non-military assistance for the international effort in response to Iraqi moves 
in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and his government rebuffed repeated U.S. requests for greater Japanese 
participation in the current Mideast operations, such as a naval presence, 
minesweepers, military airlifts or the dispatch of noncombatant military 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration reacted coolly to Japan's proposals, making it clear it 
believes Kaifu's offer of help does not go far enough. Although Kaifu did not 
specify how much Japan would spend on its plan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji 
Sakamoto told reporters early today that Japan will offer $1 billion to 
multinational forces in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler termed the Japanese 
package "useful first steps" but said the Administration wants to talk to Japan 
about "further steps and contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some U.S. officials expressed their disappointment with Japan more 
bluntly. "It's something, but we're the ones whose (lives) are on the line, and 
they're getting 70% of their oil from the gulf," one Administration official 
said. A State Department official said, "We want to see the Japanese flag there 
(in the Persian Gulf)," and then added, "This is not what we had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials characterized the prime minister's announcement 
as a significant "first step" in Japan's response to the Middle East crisis 
because it established a legal framework for action. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's postwar constitution -- adopted while the country was under American 
occupation -- has a provision prohibiting the use of force to settle 
international disputes. That provision has been interpreted to mean that 
deployment in the gulf of even non-combat personnel from Japan's Self- Defense 
Forces would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Japan decided to "urgently dispatch" a team of about 100 medical 
volunteers to the region; charter Japanese civilian aircraft and ships to carry 
non-military supplies such as water, food and medicine, and provide equipment 
to help protect allied troops from the desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We sought every possible contribution we could make within the constraints of 
the constitution," Kaifu said during a nationally televised news conference. 
"We cannot take part militarily, but we have decided to do our utmost to help 
maintain peace in the region in accordance with U.N. Security Council 
resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
The government also will pay for the chartering of non-Japanese aircraft and 
ships to carry supplies and personnel to the gulf -- including foreign military 
equipment and troops. Japanese airlines and seamen's unions had rejected the 
idea of transporting war materiel. 
</P>
<P>
Also, economic assistance of "significant magnitude" will be provided to 
Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and possibly other gulf nations to help alleviate the 
damaging effects of the U.N. blockade against Iraq. Japanese Foreign Minister 
Taro Nakayama visited the region last week and heard requests for billions of 
dollars in aid. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said Japan would contribute an initial $10 million toward the relief 
effort for refugees in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four weeks, U.S. officials have conveyed expectations that Japan 
would take a more visible role in the gulf. Michael J. Armacost, U.S. 
ambassador to Japan, has taken an unusually vocal stand in the Japanese media, 
asking that Japan "share the risk" as well as the financial cost, and warning 
that U.S.-Japan relations may suffer if Americans see the response as 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
According to a State Department official, the Administration asked Japan to 
help the United States in four ways. He said it asked Japan for some form of 
naval presence in the Persian Gulf; for economic help to Mideast countries; for 
help in the sea lift and airlift of American men, women and materials, and for 
financial assistance for the U.S. military forces. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four U.S. requests, Kaifu on Wednesday went along with two: economic 
help and help for the air and sea lift. But a State Department official said 
Japan's offer to provide two civilian aircraft and two ships for the 
transportation effort "is far below our needs and far beyond Japan's 
capabilities. . . . We'd like to see an increase in Japan's airlift and 
sea-lift capacities." 
</P>
<P>
Taizo Watanabe, chief spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, said late 
Wednesday he understood the initial U.S. reaction was "positive" and that some 
U.S. officials "said they were impressed with the list." 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe compared the package to a "baby," saying that it may look small now 
but it has the potential to grow in the future. He also said the government 
took into consideration the likelihood that Asian neighbors -- victims of 
Japanese wartime aggression -- would feel "uncomfortable" if a more ambitious 
plan had been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first experience in our postwar history to contribute to working 
for peace and stability in a region so far away from Japan," Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the measures were a "happy compromise" aimed at high visibility but in 
an entirely non-military role -- and one that goes beyond merely paying for the 
efforts of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had considered a proposal to contribute indirectly toward the cost of 
America's massive military deployment in Saudi Arabia by increasing the 
host-nation support the government pays for U.S. troops based in Japan, but 
that was not included in Kaifu's announcement. Watanabe said the idea of 
increasing host-nation support predated the Iraqi invasion and was still under 
study. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a strategic plan to protect oil supplies, Japan adopted a highly 
conciliatory posture in relations with Middle East nations after it was caught 
off-guard in the oil shocks of the 1970s. It kept a polite distance from 
Israel, opened a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
maintained friendly ties with both Iran and Iraq during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Japan reluctantly followed the United 
States and the European nations in imposing economic sanctions and boycotting 
oil from those two countries. Like its allies, Japan had a large number of its 
citizens working and living in Iraq and Kuwait. As of Wednesday night, there 
were more than 400 Japanese being held against their will.

HUSSEIN SCOFFS AT U.S. MILITARY THREAT; 
</P>

INTERVIEWS: IN RAMBLING ACCOUNTS TO ANCHORMEN, THE IRAQI LEADER SAID THE U.S. 
WAS NOT "THE ANGEL OF DEATH" AND BERATED FRANCE FOR JOINING THE BLOCKADE.

<P>
In two television interviews Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared 
that Kuwait will be part of his country forever and scoffed at the idea that 
U.S. forces could kill him in an air attack, saying "the United States is not 
the Angel of Death." 
</P>
<P>
"In all of history, not one head of state has been killed in an attack from the 
air," a smiling Hussein said in a rambling two-hour interview with a French 
television anchorman. "Can you give me an example?" 
</P>
<P>
In a 90-minute interview with CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, Hussein said no 
one should "dismiss any possibility for new ideas," but insisted that he will 
not negotiate a withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is part of Iraq," he said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether that meant forever, he replied, "We have said this, and the 
legislative bodies in Iraq have issued a clear decree, a clear decision, saying 
that Kuwait is an Iraqi province." Any negotiations, he suggested, would 
involve the question of "withdrawal of the United States from our sacred 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
His inflexible and defiant public posture is significant, because Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait is likely to be the key issue in scheduled discussions 
today in Jordan between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. Perez de Cuellar's initiative is seen as the 
most important effort yet to solve the crisis diplomatically. "We know nothing 
about the United Nations," Hussein told Rather. However, he added that if Perez 
de Cuellar "submits any of these ideas, we will, of course, talk to him because 
we respect Mr. (Perez) de Cuellar as he represents the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president also denied reports that he had offered, through back 
channels to the White House, a negotiated Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday, the Long Island and New York newspaper, reported Wednesday that Iraq 
told the White House it would allow foreigners to leave and pull its troops 
from Kuwait if U.N. sanctions are lifted and Iraq is guaranteed access to the 
Persian Gulf, as well as control of an oil field that crosses into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several Bush Administration officials said Wednesday that they see no reason to 
believe the report. 
</P>
<P>
The French interviewer, Patrick Poivre d'Avor, asked Hussein if he constantly 
moved his office or stayed in a bunker to avoid an air attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein has confronted the greatest dangers," the Iraqi leader said. 
"You are surely aware of the history of Saddam Hussein. And the United States 
is not the Angel of Death." 
</P>
<P>
The statements seemed to reflect a preoccupation with the notion that the 
United States is hoping to cripple the Iraqi government by removing Hussein, 
either by assassination or a coup. 
</P>
<P>
At another point in the French interview, Hussein said: "The big superpower is 
gambling if they think they can win a war simply by getting rid of Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, we are optimistic," he said. "The future belongs to us. For the 
United States to win, they must prevail on three fronts: They must defeat the 
Iraqi army; they must destroy the Iraqi economy, and they must bring down the 
government. Only one of those things will not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the frequent comparison of Hussein with the 
Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler, he said: "What about Algeria and what about 
the people of Algeria? What do they think about Saddam Hussein? What about the 
people of Tunisia? What about Jordan? What can we say about the Arabs of 
Europe? Is Saddam Hussein there forcing them to have opinions or forcing them 
to act the way they act? Do they say that I am Hitler or a dictator in those 
places?" 
</P>
<P>
The French interview began at a Baghdad center for international conferences 
where the Iraqis had assembled more than a dozen civilian hostages, including 
several from the United States. The hostages were shown being served by waiters 
offering silver trays of iced fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
The interviews were said to be the first that Hussein has granted to individual 
Western reporters since his invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Rather whether Iraq would use chemical weapons other than in response 
to nuclear attack by the United States, Hussein avoided a direct answer. "In 
any and all cases, never imagine that we are going to relinquish Iraq," he 
said. " . . . Expect that Iraq is not going to be an easy bite to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president also warned that in a war with Iraq, "the harm caused to 
the invaders who come here would be greater than whatever they suffered in 
Vietnam. Iraq will come out victorious." 
</P>
<P>
The White House declined to comment on the interview. 
</P>
<P>
As in earlier appearances, Hussein reached out to touch the heads of the 
children, several of whom flinched. But most of it took place as Hussein paced 
back and forth in a marble reception hall, military aides at his side. He spoke 
in Arabic, and his remarks were translated into French and English. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein spoke of his disappointment that the French government had joined in 
the international sanctions against Iraq, and of his belief in the ultimate 
victory of his country over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Poivre d'Avor, broadcasting later from Amman, Jordan, said the videocassette of 
the interview was confiscated immediately after the interview by Iraqi 
officials, who kept it for eight hours before returning it. But he said that 
only one question had been deleted. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had asked Hussein, "How can a proud man like you hide behind women 
and children?" Even though Hussein did not reply, he said, the question was 
deleted from the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein appeared poised and confident, dressed in a gray suit of European cut 
and a green tie. From time to time, he would turn to a military aide for 
smiling, head-bobbing encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
He reserved some of his harshest criticism for France. For the past 20 years, 
since French President Charles de Gaulle embraced a Middle East policy with 
Iraq as the pivot, France has been Iraq's best friend in the West. The French 
government supported Hussein's revolutionary government in its struggle to 
nationalize the British-controlled oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
It stood by the Iraqi government in its costly war with Iran. France was second 
only to the Soviet Union in supplying arms to Iraq, and Iraq still owes France 
an estimated $4.5 billion, nearly a quarter of the Iraqi foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Iraqi officials felt betrayed when the French government joined other 
countries in supporting the sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The only blame we have is against France," Saddam said angrily. "We don't 
directly blame the United States or Great Britain, because they were never 
objective. They were never our friends." 
</P>

BUILDUP: A DESTROYER AND THREE MINE-HUNTERS WILL JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL 
FLOTILLA ENFORCING U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ.

Declaring that Western weapons have already made "further aggression a risky 
venture indeed" for Iraq, British Defense Secretary Tom King disclosed 
Wednesday that his government is dispatching more warships to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
King, who is touring the region, told reporters on board the frigate Battleaxe 
in port in Bahrain that three mine-hunters will be sent from the eastern 
Mediterranean, along with the destroyer Gloucester from Britain. They will join 
three British warships in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In the little more than a week since the Bahraini government approved use of 
its air bases by British forces, this small island nation, which is linked to 
the Saudi mainland by a 15-mile-long causeway, has begun to bristle with 
foreign arms. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-plane squadron of Tornado fighter-bombers arrived Tuesday at Manama's 
Muharraq International Airport. In addition, a battery of Rapier anti-aircraft 
missiles has been deployed to protect the Tornado base. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said American aircraft are using another airfield, on the 
southern part of the island. 
</P>
<P>
King said the British government has no immediate plans to send ground troops 
to the region, but "we are keeping all these matters under review." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the "total unacceptability" of Iraq's invasion and annexation of 
Kuwait and added, "We rule nothing out." 
</P>
<P>
With the eight ships of the U.S. Middle East Task Force operating in Persian 
Gulf waters, and warships from France, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Spain, Belgium and Greece pledged to the gulf defenses, the waterway that 
carries more than 25% of the world's oil to markets -- or did so before the 
blockade of Iraqi and Kuwaiti ports -- promises to be thick with warships. 
</P>
<P>
King said British, American and other forces are attempting to harmonize their 
operations, "making sure we don't trip each other up." So far, no multinational 
naval command has been established. 
</P>
<P>
All the Western countries involved have separate intelligence operations 
tracking Iraqi shipping, King said, but when asked whether there is a "big 
board" somewhere collating intelligence reports, he replied, "The answer is 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi response to the teeming patrol forces in the gulf, which are backed 
by three U.S. aircraft carriers off the Arabian Peninsula, has been to lie low, 
British military officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Comdr. Nick Harland, second in command of the Battleaxe, said, "I think 
it's already become a very effective embargo." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Battleaxe and its sister ships of what the British call their 
Armilla patrol have not sighted an Iraqi ship for 10 days. The last was an 
outbound tanker, riding high and empty. No attempt was made to stop or to board 
the ship, he said, pointing out that the encounter took place before last 
weekend's U.N. Security Council resolution permitting the blockaders to use 
force. 
</P>
<P>
With the balance of forces sharply against him at sea, Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein has ordered his tanker skippers not to resist boarders. There have been 
no reports that his navy of five frigates and eight missile boats has left 
Iraqi waters at the top of the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But among the Western ships, "it's getting very crowded," Harland said. 
Nevertheless, he added, sometimes "you can go for some hours without seeing 
another warship." U.S. and British ships coordinate movements on a daily basis 
and patrol separate areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We all talk to each other when we pass," he said, "trying to develop easy 
relations. . . . . We also talked to the Soviets (a single frigate deployed in 
the gulf), and they seemed to be very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
On the Armilla patrol, ships at sea are at a condition of readiness called 
"defense quarters," with 50% of the crew on watch at all times. 
</P>
<P>
The highest concerns are hostile aircraft and mines. No mining has been 
confirmed so far, but it is not a difficult operation. During the 1980-88 war 
between Iran and Iraq, mines were laid in the gulf from low-flying helicopters 
and speedboats. 
</P>
<P>
The Battleaxe, 425 feet long, was designed for anti-submarine warfare but 
carries a variety of armaments, including Exocet anti-ship missiles, a Seawolf 
air-defense missile system and two Lynx helicopters, which, Harland said, "can 
do all sorts of things." 
</P>
<P>
British marines on board the Battleaxe conducted a demonstration Wednesday to 
show that in an air attack, every weapon would be thrown into the battle. 
Marine teams operate a hand-held Javelin anti-aircraft missile launcher. 
</P>
<P>
"You just stand up here against this rail, get the plane in your sights and 
fire," one explained.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov this week criticized the 
U.S. expulsion of Iraqi diplomats as causing an escalation of tension in the 
Persian Gulf region. He said his country will not follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this explosive 
situation," Gerasimov said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official conceded, however, that the Soviet Union faces a moral conflict 
because Soviet military specialists continue to assist the Iraqi army, which is 
equipped chiefly with Soviet weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the United States expelled 36 of the 55 members of the Iraqi Embassy 
staff in Washington and encouraged other countries to act similarly. 
</P>
<P>
The move was in response to Iraq's demands that all foreign countries close 
their embassies in Kuwait, which Iraq has invaded and annexed. The United 
States and some other countries have refused to close their embassies in 
Kuwait. The staff of the Soviet Embassy has left, but the Kremlin maintains 
that the embassy is still legally open. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Iraq's actions to close embassies in Kuwait are illegitimate," 
Gerasimov told reporters. "But if you use a tit-for-tat policy in this 
question, you risk falling into the spiral of escalation and aggravating the 
situation. We do not plan such action." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, Gerasimov said that the Soviet Union, Iraq's No. 1 
arms supplier before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, is not breaking U.N. 
Security Council sanctions by keeping military specialists in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"From the legal point of view, there are no violations," he said. "But a moral 
problem does exist, and we will try to resolve it." 
</P>
<P>
After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Kremlin quickly cut off arms sales to the 
government of Saddam Hussein and has repeatedly denounced Iraq's action. On 
Saturday, it supported a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force by 
foreign naval forces blockading Iraq, but President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said 
his government has no plans to use force against its former ally. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a delicate situation, so we are approaching it cautiously," Gerasimov 
said, continuing to emphasize the use of diplomacy rather than force. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Gerasimov said, the first group of relatives of Soviet 
military specialists working in Iraq, 240 women and children, arrived in 
Moscow. He said all 983 military dependents are expected to be home by 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 Soviet nationals, mostly oil workers, diplomats and dependents, 
were in Iraq at the time of the invasion. The 880 who were in Kuwait have 
already been evacuated. However, the Kremlin has announced no plans to pull out 
the approximately 5,000 Soviets remaining in Iraq, some of whom by Soviet 
admission have been training the Iraqis in the use of Soviet-made military 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The 193 Soviet military specialists may not come home until their contracts run 
out, Gerasimov said, but he predicted that existing contracts will not be 
renewed and that no new contracts will be signed. 
</P>
<P>
Several Soviet peace and disarmament organizations issued a joint statement 
calling for the withdrawal of all military specialists from Iraq until Iraq 
abandons its claim to Kuwait, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said that although the Soviet government is staying in close contact 
with Baghdad in an effort to forge a political settlement, it does not want a 
special role as a go-between.

CLUB FOR BIBLIOPHILES VOTES TO ADMIT WOMEN MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-two years after its founding, the Zamorano Club, a distinguished 
organization of Southern California bibliophiles that includes many luminaries 
in the book-collecting world, has been quietly integrated. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the private club, named after California's first printer, Don 
Augustin Zamorano, has limited its membership to 80 men -- a practice that 
failed to cause any ripples for most of its history. 
</P>
<P>
But after two women, Victoria Steele, head of USC Library's special 
collections, and Doris Harris, an autograph and manuscript dealer, were denied 
membership by the club's board of governors last spring, all that changed. 
</P>
<P>
The rejections led to the resignation of three prominent bibliophiles and an 
informal poll of the the membership, which voted "overwhelmingly" to admit 
women, according to Loren H. Rothschild, a Los Angeles industrialist who 
tabulated the results. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to this pressure, the seven-member board voted unanimously earlier 
this month to invite five women to join. Zamorano President Martin Ridge 
declined to name them. Steele, however, said she was not among them. Harris was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ridge, a senior research associate at the Huntington Library, sought to 
minimize the significance of the vote, noting that three of the club's 15 
honorary members are women and that the club's bylaws contain no language 
prohibiting female members. 
</P>
<P>
But it was apparently Ridge himself who helped precipitate the resignations of 
Dr. Irwin (Jack) Pincus, a retired gastroenterologist, Daniel H. Woodward, 
departing librarian at the Huntington Library, and Robert Vosper, UCLA 
librarian and professor emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've written several letters saying, 'if you don't like what the club does, 
quit,"' Ridge acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
After the resignations, Rothschild and other members warned Zamoranons in a 
letter that "the continued existence of the club as a responsible and respected 
institution is in great jeopardy," according to a draft provided to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Steele said she was surprised and disappointed not to be among the first women 
invited to join the club, which holds most of its meetings at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Ridge declined to comment on Steele's exclusion or to say whether the members 
who resigned would be invited back. TERRY PRISTIN

Harris' attorneys will ask the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for a 
rehearing before an 11-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
If rejected, they then will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a stay 
blocking Harris' execution remains in effect indefinitely. Attorneys say an 
execution before the end of the calendar year is unlikely.

Tens of thousands of public service workers staged wildcat strikes for better 
pay across East Germany on Wednesday, clogging city centers with convoys of 
honking ambulances, garbage trucks and fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
Public transport, hospitals, water and fire services came to a standstill for 
two hours in the largest protest so far by workers in the 1.6-million-strong 
East German service sector. 
</P>
<P>
The stoppage indicated growing disillusionment with the German unification 
process.

SOVIET COMMUNISTS CEDE CONTROL OVER MOST TOP JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: TO SOME EXTENT, THE PARTY'S SELECTION POWER ALREADY HAD BEEN WRESTED 
AWAY. THE SYSTEM IMPEDED PERESTROIKA.

<P>
In another sign of the Soviet Communist Party's waning influence and changing 
political role, its leadership on Wednesday abandoned the so-called 
nomenklatura system, which empowered Communists to control virtually every 
important job in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The nomenklatura system was a key element of the party's power monopoly, now 
being dismantled under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It had given the party 
the right to choose, in secret, who would occupy perhaps 3 million key 
positions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Top government and armed forces posts were included, but so were those of 
factory directors, labor union bosses and the managers of department stores. 
Although never codified in law, the practice had given the Communist apparatus 
fabulous power in all realms of society since the era of Soviet founder V. I. 
Lenin, but the system impeded the reforms and new thinking now so keenly sought 
by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"A research institute director, the editor of a literary magazine, the head of 
a trade department must by approved by the appropriate party committee," the 
tabloid weekly Moscow News said this year. All too often, the person chosen was 
selected not because of professional qualifications or accomplishments but 
because of party ties or adherence to orthodox political views. 
</P>
<P>
Non-party members could be named to some jobs but had no say in the selection 
process. "The system is illicit in that it cannot be controlled or held 
responsible," Moscow News complained. "A real dictatorship is not burdened by 
any laws and is not accountable to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Heeding the new realities of Soviet political life, the Communist Party 
Secretariat decided Wednesday to relinquish its veto power over top political 
and economic jobs, although, to some degree, events already had wrested away 
that power. 
</P>
<P>
"It is considered expedient to abandon the nomenklatura posts of the CC CPSU 
(Central Committee of the Communist Party)," declared the Secretariat, which 
manages day-to-day party affairs. "From now on, only party workers, heads of 
press organs, scientific agencies and institutions of learning subordinate to 
the CC CPSU will be approved" by the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the party's policy-making Central Committee in charge of only those 
positions that have party connections -- for example, the editorship of the 
party's flagship daily newspaper Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, under the aegis of Gorbachev, a high-level party commission 
recommended that the party terminate the nomenklatura system in picking the 
occupants of top jobs and allow instead "an influx of active campaigners for 
perestroika (political and economic reform) from among Communists, non-party 
members and members of all sectors of the population." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision also represented a tacit recognition on the part of the 
Moscow-based party apparatus that it has lost the power to impose its will 
throughout what is becoming a fragmented society. Entire republics, from the 
Russian Federation to Armenia, are now in the hands of non-Communists, and 
their leaders, such as Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, refuse to obey party 
decrees. 
</P>
<P>
In many regions, the party machine continues to dominate local life, however, 
and in those places the effect of the change will be problematic. The 
Secretariat recommended that personnel policy in the 15 Soviet republics be 
redefined by local party leaders to take into account "new conditions," but 
that is no guarantee such a thing will happen. 
</P>
<P>
The most important nomenklatura, or roster of jobs over which the party claimed 
right of review, had long been filled by the party's supreme organs, such as 
the Politburo and Secretariat. The positions include, among others, defense 
minister and chairman of the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
The national party congress this summer made it clear, however, that the center 
of gravity in Soviet political life has shifted to the governmental 
institutions established by Gorbachev, including his personal cabinet, the 
Presidential Council.

Told that gang graffiti has reached "epidemic" proportions in parts of Los

President Corazon Aquino, who has ignored calls for a cease-fire with 
guerrillas in the Philippines, said Wednesday she was considering Senate 
proposals for peace talks with both leftist and rightist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said in a statement that she has directed her security advisers "to take 
up and consider the Senate resolution calling for support to peace initiatives, 
reconciliation and peaceful dialogue on all fronts." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was advanced last week, amid a rash of bombings in the capital -- 
17 since Aug. 13. The attacks were viewed as threatening another uprising 
against Aquino, whom the rebels have accused of inefficiency and corruption.

Riot policemen swinging batons and firing tear gas on Wednesday dispersed 
thousands of ethnic Albanians awaiting a U.S. congressional delegation so that 
they could complain about what they call human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people chanting, "Freedom! Freedom!" and "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" 
gathered in front of a downtown hotel where the delegation of seven senators 
was expected to hold talks with leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in the 
southern Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
A radio report said six people were injured and six arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), arrived in Pristina three 
hours after the clash and was driven under heavy police escort to a hotel for a 
meeting with leaders of dissident Albanian groups. Another meeting with the 
leaders of the rival Serbian community also was planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We will talk to the senators about the unbearable conditions for Albanians in 
Kosovo and about the fact that our political parties are still illegal," said 
Ibrahim Rugova, head of the 500,000-member Democratic Union, the largest ethnic 
Albanian political party in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The senators will see for themselves what kind of police repression we live 
under," Rugova said. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90% of Kosovo's 1.9-million people, are 
protesting last month's decision by the Communist authorities of Serbia to 
reduce Kosovo's autonomy. Kosovo is an administrative district of Serbia, 
Yugoslavia's largest republic. 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been the site of tension between ethnic Albanians and Slavs since 
Serbia began to restrict the province's self-government last year. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd waiting for the Dole delegation thinned when speakers announced that 
it would not arrive until early afternoon. But a group of several thousand 
people refused to disperse and continued to chant until the police officers 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few minutes, the entire downtown area was cleared of protesters, who 
had pelted policemen with stones and bottles. Officers patrolled the streets in 
armored vehicles after the clash and ordered groups of more than five people to 
disperse.

Freed hostage Brian Keenan had an emotional reunion Wednesday with his 
69-year-old mother, who had her first drink in 11 years to toast his release. 
</P>
<P>
Minnie Keenan was driven to Dublin from her home in Belfast to see her only 
son, who is resting and undergoing medical tests at Mater Private Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old university lecturer was freed Friday after 4 1/2 years as a 
hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Keenan laughed and joked with her son, who looked healthier than in recent 
days as he sat on his hospital bed surrounded by cards and flowers from 
well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour reunion, during which she sipped from a glass of Guinness 
stout, she was too emotional to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"She enjoyed meeting Brian so much and even had a glass of alcohol, her first 
one in 11 years," said family friend Frank McCallam. "She has had a ball." 
</P>
<P>
There are 13 Westerners still held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest 
is Terry Anderson of the Associated Press. He was kidnaped March 16, 1985.

MASKED MOHAWKS HELP SOLDIERS DISMANTLE BARRICADES; 
</P>
<P>
CANADA: THE DECISION TO REOPEN A BRIDGE IS MADE TO AVOID BLOODSHED. BUT INDIANS 
SAY BARRIERS AT THE SITE OF THE ORIGINAL DISPUTE WILL REMAIN.

Masked Mohawks on Wednesday helped soldiers tear down barricades set up seven 
weeks ago near the Mercier Bridge, avoiding a bloody confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
But other Mohawks said the original dispute remains unsettled and barricades at 
nearby Oka will remain. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in front of one barricade leading to the community of 
Chateauguay and the Kahnawake reserve, army officers and unarmed members of the 
Mohawks' Warrior Society began bringing the Mercier Bridge barrier down with 
heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides then began dismantling another barricade near Chateauguay on a 
highway blocked since July 11, when Mohawks at Oka fought a gun battle with 
provincial police in a dispute over land that the community of Oka had 
earmarked as a golf course. The Indians contend it is ancestral land. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer was killed. Responsibility in the death has not been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Other Indians shut down Mercier Bridge in support of the Mohawks at Oka, 
infuriating commuters and local businesses and leading to outbreaks of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
A Mohawk spokesman at the Kahnesatake community in Oka, 18 miles west of 
Montreal, said the barricades there will remain. He said the agreement at 
Kahnawake affects only that reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"This place holds the key to everything," Dan David, a spokesman for the 
Kahnesatake Mohawks, said. "Everybody knows this is where everything started 
and this is where everything must end." 
</P>
<P>
There were no talks between the army and the Mohawks near Oka. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, four trucks, two front-end loaders on flatbed trucks and two 
armored personnel carriers moved toward the Mohawk barricades near the bridge. 
Reports circulated that the government had issued an ultimatum to Indian 
negotiators to settle or face army guns. 
</P>
<P>
Mohawk spokesman Jack LeClaire said: "The decision was taken to avoid 
bloodshed. We have reached an honorable settlement between the military and the 
community of Kahnawake." 
</P>
<P>
The moves in Chateauguay caused confusion among Mohawks in both Oka and at a 
suburban hotel at Dorval where Kahnawake leaders were negotiating with army and 
government representatives when news came that the barricades at the bridge 
were being destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the dismantling began, two soldiers got out of a truck, advanced to 
the barricade, went behind it and emerged with two masked members of the 
Warrior Society. 
</P>
<P>
A Mohawk operated a mechanical shovel on one side of the barricade while two 
army bulldozers worked on the other side to bring it down. About 20 masked but 
unarmed Mohawks helped with the dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the army began filling in a large trench in front of the 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
LeClaire said, "The bridge will be inspected. If the Quebec Department of 
Transport says it is passable, we hope it will be open by the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The army earlier Wednesday had moved to within 650 feet of the blockaded bridge 
to the island of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers near St. Isidore village, close to the Kahnawake reservation, had set 
up six 105-millimeter howitzers in a cornfield, aimed at the reservation and 
the blocked bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd Battalion had set up positions near Mercier Bridge on Wednesday, and 
the army positioned heavy artillery also. 
</P>
<P>
A Mohawk source earlier Wednesday reported a proposal that a joint Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police-Mohawk police force remove the bridge barricades 
together, the Mohawk contingent to be drawn from Kahnawake's legally recognized 
native police, known as the Peacekeepers.

MOHAWKS, POLICE TEAR DOWN BARRICADES; 
</P>
<P>
CANADA: THE ACTION IS A STEP TOWARD RESOLVING THE ARMED STANDOFF. MONTREAL 
COMMUTER BRIDGE SHOULD BE REOPENED BY WEEKEND.

Canadian army troops and masked Mohawks jointly dismantled barricades at a key 
commuter bridge into Montreal on Wednesday, taking a major and unexpected step 
toward resolving an armed standoff that has preoccupied this country for seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden army-Indian cooperation came just as the army was scheduled to 
demolish the barricades by itself, using armored personnel carriers fitted with 
bulldozer blades. Because the Mohawks manning the roadblock were heavily armed, 
many Canadians had feared the demolition would trigger a blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the bridge, which is normally crossed by 60,000 to 70,000 
commuters a day, should be open to normal traffic by the weekend. The Indians' 
blockade had caused major dislocations for suburbanites living across the St. 
Lawrence River from Montreal. In recent days and weeks, they have been venting 
their frustration by burning Indians in effigy, blocking ambulances carrying 
sick Indians to hospitals and pelting unarmed Indians with stones the size of 
grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
Such hot-headed acts seem likely to taper off once the bridge is opened, but 
the standoff had not been fully resolved as of Wednesday night. Well-armed 
Mohawks were still manning another barricade on the main road through Oka, a 
pleasant village northwest and across the river from the bridge blockade. This 
remaining barricade first went up last spring and was more heavily fortified in 
June after a botched raid by Quebec provincial policemen in which one officer 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
It was that raid that led Indians to protest by setting up the bridge 
blockades. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between Indian and white negotiators were continuing late into the 
evening, and there was widespread hope that the Oka blockade could also be 
dismantled peacefully, bringing a nonviolent ending to Quebec's lengthy Indian 
standoff. That would be good news not only for the Indians involved but for the 
Canadian armed forces, which are normally used only on United Nations 
peacekeeping missions in international hot spots and which haven't entered into 
combat since the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian army's nonviolent mission is a source of national pride, and their 
deployment at home has surprised and dismayed the country. As troops set up 
their sandbags and moved armored personnel carriers and even artillery pieces 
into position near the Indian encampments, white Canadian civilians in various 
parts of the country took to the streets to protest. Many feared a shoot-out in 
Quebec that would disrupt Indian-white relations in Canada for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Texas when Martin Luther King was assassinated, and America was a 
nation scarred after that," said protester Frank Spataro, who feared the same 
thing for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, David Parsons was holding up a large banner that read: "If you like 
South Africa, you'll love Quebec," and he waved it every time an armored 
personnel carrier rolled by. "If one drop of blood is shed here, Quebec and 
Canada will burn," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Indians across Canada have already been blocking roads and railroad 
tracks this summer, sympathetic with and inspired by the Mohawks of Quebec. One 
bulldozer-wielding group in Alberta is even trying to redirect a river to flow 
around a large new dam. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has called the armed Mohawks 
"terrorists." He has been careful, however, to distinguish between the armed 
Mohawks who have been manning the barricades -- who hail from a paramilitary 
group called the Warrior Society -- and ordinary, unarmed Mohawks. 
</P>
<P>
Army officials say the Mohawk Warriors operating around Montreal possess, among 
other things, AK-47 assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns and M-16s, the weapon 
typically issued to American soldiers in Vietnam. The army has also speculated 
that the Warriors have mortars and anti-tank weapons. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word Wednesday on whether the Warrior Society would have 
to relinquish its weapons now that the barricades in Quebec are coming down. 
The terms of the agreement that led to the dismantling had not yet been made 
public. Earlier, however, Mulroney had promised that the Mohawks of Oka would 
be given control of the development site that had touched off the whole 
controversy when the community proposed to build a golf course on what the 
Indians claim is ancestral land.

UNITED WAY REACHES $5.6-MILLION GOAL

Ventura County United Way matched its $5.6-million 1989-90 campaign goal and 
will continue to fund 64 local health and human-care agencies, United Way 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This will ensure help for one out of every three people in the county who will 
need counseling, guidance and emergency services through the United Way 
agencies for another year," Charlie Lyons, United Way board president, said. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 volunteers helped in the fund-raising campaign that began Sept. 15 
and ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
About 76% of the money raised was through payroll deduction plans that are set 
up in 99% of Ventura County businesses. The remainder was committed by 
individuals, corporations and foundations, Sylvia Schnopp, United Way 
spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees contribute most of the money through their paychecks because 
it's simple and painless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Local chapters of the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, 
Interface: Children, Family Services and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Ventura 
will receive the most money from the budget, Schnopp said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest contribution came from the largest employer in the county, the 
federal government. Employees contributed $763,555 to the organization, 
$438,000 of which will go to local agencies and the rest will be distributed to 
social service organizations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
GTE Corp. workers gave the second largest employee contribution, $330,000. 
Martin V. Smith, the largest individual donor, contributed $25,000. LAURA

REQUEST FOR STUDY OF SCHOOL SITE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The board of the Oxnard Elementary School District voted unanimously Wednesday 
night against seeking an environmental impact report for a proposed 
intermediate school in the La Colonia neighborhood, moving a step closer to 
construction of the $16-million school. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came despite objections from Marc L. Charney, an attorney who 
represents the company that owns the 25-acre proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
Charney told the board that an initial study of the proposed Robert J. Frank 
Intermediate School indicated that a full environmental report was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Charney, who represents the F.M. Daily Oxnard Ranch Co., said the district 
should seek the report to determine what increase in noise, pollution and 
traffic the 1,200-student school would bring to the area, proposed for Juanita 
Avenue near North Alley. 
</P>
<P>
Charney said the school would add 1,165 cars a day to Old Colonia Road and 
Juanita Avenue, both two-lane streets leading to the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, however, said the initial study was sufficient and addresses the 
school's potential impact on the neighborhood. The school is scheduled to open 
by September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Norman Brekke said district officials have been working for three years 
to build the badly needed school, but construction has been delayed because of 
disputes over its location and the cost of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Land-value estimates have ranged from $70,000 an acre by a district-hired 
appraiser to $250,000 an acre by the owners, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
The district would have to condemn the land to acquire it. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

Kathleen Brown, Democratic candidate for state treasurer, is scheduled as the 
keynote speaker for the Ventura County Democrats' Sixth Annual Labor Day 
Barbecue at Oxnard College Park on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Day barbecue is the traditional campaign kickoff for Democratic 
candidates in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Democratic event in the county, the barbecue is expected to draw 
about 400 people to meet the lineup of area Democratic candidates for state, 
local and national office. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers include state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara); Assemblyman 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria); Anita Perez Ferguson, who is challenging Rep. 
Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura); Richard Frieman, who is challenging Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), and Ginny Connell, who is challenging 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Brown, a lawyer and former member of the Los Angeles Board of Public 
Works, is trying to unseat state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, a Republican. She 
is the daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr. and sister of former Gov. 
Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's $15 per person barbecue will raise money to establish a Democratic 
headquarters in a county that has 20,000 more registered Republicans than 
Democrats. The event is sponsored by Democrats/Labor United of Ventura County.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: ACCUSED KIDNAPER PLEADS NOT GUILTY 
</P>

<P>
A Port Hueneme man accused of kidnaping and sexually assaulting his housemate 
and her 7-year-old daughter pleaded not guilty to 12 charges during his 
arraignment in Ventura County Municipal Court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Justo Dungca, 34, was being held on $1-million bail in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca, is charged with kidnaping a child, two acts of child molestation, three 
counts of sexual battery on the mother, robbery of an automobile and grand 
theft for allegedly taking a federal tax-refund check from the mother, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca also is charged with kidnaping for robbery and kidnaping for extortion. 
The robbery stems from Dungca's alleged use of the woman's car to take the 
woman and her child from Port Hueneme to Anaheim, where the woman escaped. 
Dungca was later apprehended in Las Vegas, where he had taken the child and was 
trying to sell the car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping for extortion charge results from Dungca's allegedly forcing the 
woman to pay for a tankful of gas during the ride, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office also is charging Dungca with attempted murder 
and false imprisonment of a hostage, both of which allegedly occurred in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said the mother is concerned about testifying against Dungca. 
</P>
<P>
To shield her from testifying during the preliminary hearing, O'Neill said he 
was considering pushing for a hearsay preliminary, which, under Proposition 
115, would allow one investigator or police officer to testify about all the 
evidence and interviews gathered. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, O'Neill said, Dungca sexually molested the girl, whom he was 
baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the girl called her mother and asked her to come home from 
work because she was sick. When the woman arrived home, Dungca bound and gagged 
her and her daughter in his bedroom, where he sexually assaulted the mother, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, he forced them to drive with him to Anaheim, where the woman fled 
but was unable to free her daughter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca was found the next day in Las Vegas, where he was trying to sell the 
car, said Lt. Greg Jolley of the Las Vegas police. As police approached, Dungca 
caught the girl in a stranglehold and beat her head against the floor, Jolley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was treated at a local hospital and released, Jolley said. CAROL WATSON

Public protest has delayed Fillmore City Council action on a request to expand 
hours at Hurst Concrete Products in the North Fillmore Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of a July 5 decision by the Planning Commission, which would allow 
Hurst to extend its storage yard and ship products around the clock, will be 
continued at the Sept. 25 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, 10 residents from the area near the industrial park 
added their statements to the official appeal of Bill Boren, whose home is 
adjacent to the concrete manufacturing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Noise, dust and a failure to fulfill landscaping conditions placed on Hurst by 
earlier permits were major complaints during a three-hour hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A committee including council members, citizens and representatives from Hurst 
Concrete will study the issue and recommend solutions to the council next 
month. JANET BERGAMO

5 MEN ARRESTED IN SCHEME TO BILK PROSPECTIVE RENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA , TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested five men Wednesday who ran a South Los Angeles 
rental agency for allegedly bilking hundreds of people who paid as much as $800 
each to the agency to help them find low-cost apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested Jose Gonzales, 31, and Edward Peteja, 26, both of Redondo 
Beach; Leon Mooers, 27, of Norwalk; Disan Aramburo, 19, of Walnut Park; and 
Everado Miranda, 18, of Downey. Authorities said they will seek charges of 
grand theft, fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The men were being held Wednesday at the Sheriff's Firestone substation. 
Arraignment will be held later this week. Authorities said they would seek bail 
of about $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The men operated the El Centro Credit Network at the 1800 block of Florence 
Avenue for approximately six months, from January to July 27, 1990, authorities 
said. The company ran advertisements in La Opinion, the largest 
Spanish-language newspaper in Los Angeles, promising to help clients find 
low-cost housing for a fee that ranged from $100 to $800. Instead, authorities 
say, the agency provided them with lists of non-existent addresses and 
apartments that were already occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they believe the company, which had since moved to Hawthorne and 
was operating for the past several weeks as the South Bay Credit Network, has 
been in existence for several years, and was previously active in the El Monte, 
Walnut Park, Downey, Montebello, Paramount and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a scam that's been operating for years and years and years," said 
Deputy Phillip Martinez, who worked on the two-month investigation. "They've 
moved around." 
</P>
<P>
The company came to the attention of detectives at the Firestone sheriff's 
substation when they received a number of similar fraud complaints. They have 
identified more than 50 victims in that area alone and believe the number of 
people cheated may be as high as 300, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Centro Credit Network preyed mainly on Latinos, many of whom are illegal 
immigrants and reluctant to come forward, authorities said. That, combined with 
the fact that victims were bilked out of fairly small sums of money, accounts 
for the long period of time the scheme was able to operate, authorities said. 
Deputies believe the alleged scheme was able to operate for such a long period 
of time because of the victims' reluctance to come forward and the relatively 
small amounts of money involved.

LOW-INTEREST HOME LOAN PLAN EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council has voted to expand its low-interest loan program 
for first-time home buyers with the condition that Pacific Central Mortage 
Inc., which underwrites the program, does a better job of promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved by the council Monday, the city will issue $12 million 
in tax-exempt municipal bonds to cover about 100 loans that would be made 
available from 1992 through 1994, said Deputy City Manager Jay Corey. The 
maximum household income for participants buying new homes will be $51,980, and 
for families buying older homes, it will be $45,200, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
The interest rates for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will be 8.25%, which is 
below the current market rate of about 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers could use the money to buy new homes with a maximum purchase price of 
$225,000 or resold homes with a maximum price of $184,400, according to the 
program's guidelines. Although the program is geared to first-time home buyers, 
those who have not owned homes in the past three years would also be eligible 
to apply for the loans, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
The program began in September, 1989, when the council issued $15 million in 
bond money to be used for 125 loans through 1992. The only difference was that 
the 30-year loans issued under that program had interest rates of 8.45%, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, 28 families have bought homes or are in escrow through the program, 
and an additional 60 have pre-qualified for the low-interest loans, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Ann Rock and Bill Davis, who also sits on the city's affordable 
housing subcommittee, said that although the council was strongly in favor of 
continuing the program, they were concerned that many realty agents and 
residents are still not aware it exists. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem we've had is getting out the word to the real estate 
community," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the council required that Pacific Central Mortgage come up with a 
promotional plan for the program as a condition to continuing it. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new marketing plan, the mortgage company has agreed to hold a minimum 
of six annual seminars for real estate agents and potential home buyers to 
inform them of the low-interest loan program. In addition, the company will 
regularly take out ads in local newspapers and mail flyers to apartment 
residents with information about how they can apply for loans. CARLOS V. LOZANO

CHANGES IN OXNARD PLAN PROTESTED

<P>
The Fillmore City Council voted Tuesday to register an official protest against 
proposed changes to Oxnard's General Plan, which the council feels could 
jeopardize development in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the annexation of 7,000 acres of agricultural land, Oxnard is 
proposing to increase jobs by 175%, while housing would grow by only 32%. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that significantly more people will be driving to Oxnard to work," 
Community Development Director Mary Ann Krause told the council. 
"Cross-commuting contributes to overall congestion, and the longer the commute, 
the more air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
According to Krause, many Fillmore residents already work in Oxnard. If jobs 
increase in Oxnard before Fillmore can attract employers, air quality 
restrictions may prevent commercial and industrial development that would 
provide jobs for Fillmore citizens, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved a letter expressing Fillmore's concerns. A copy was sent 
to Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi and the letter was to be read into the record 
during Tuesday's General Plan hearings in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's formal protest of the Oxnard plan will also be expressed to the 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which can approve or deny the proposed 
annexation. JANET BERGAMO

GARDENA WOMAN SAYS GEORGIA FIRM TOOK MONEY, KEPT 'PRIZE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Gardena woman has filed a fraud complaint alleging that a telephone sales 
company took $698 from her but failed to give her a promised $10,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena detectives investigating Kathryn Hansen's fraud complaint said she is 
one of more than 4,000 people nationwide who may have been defrauded by 
Republic Distribution Corp. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia state officials have shut down telephone operations at the company in 
response to hundreds of complaints from irate consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators who served a search warrant on the company said they found 
records indicating that as many as 4,200 people may have been defrauded of 
thousands of dollars each in the high-pressure scam, Gardena Detective Ed 
Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hansen's police report, a salesman from Republic Distribution 
called the 71-year-old woman on July 3 and told her that she had been selected 
to receive a $10,000 bonus in a few weeks if she invested $698 in the company 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Over a 90-minute period, Hansen told police, two salesmen assured her that she 
would receive $10,000 if she cooperated. However, they told her to tell a third 
salesman -- who tape-recorded only his conversation with her -- that no such 
promise had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks after Hansen sent a check by Federal Express, she received a box 
of 350 pens and a notice that she could collect a diamond-and-sapphire jewelry 
set if she sent in a $99 handling fee, Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hansen filed her complaint, the Gardena Police Department has received 
calls from at least four other South Bay residents complaining about the 
company, Burnett said. Those callers were told to contact the Atlanta Police 
Department directly. 
</P>
<P>
Republic Distribution officials referred telephone calls seeking comment to an 
Atlanta attorney, who did not return the calls.

JURY RECOMMENDS LIFE SENTENCE FOR KILLER OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance Superior Court jury on Tuesday recommended that a former Inglewood 
security guard spend the rest of his life in prison without possibility of 
parole for murdering two men in the courtyard of his apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors could have recommended that Ahmad Grigsby, 29, face the death penalty 
for the March 17, 1989, shootings. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury, which convicted Grigsby earlier this month of killing the two 
men, heard arguments during the penalty phase of Grigsby's trial that Grigsby 
is mentally disabled and should not die for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses who testified during the trial, Grigsby carried a 
shotgun from his Firmona Avenue apartment and shot the first victim, Terry 
Goring, in the chest as the man walked into the complex looking for friends to 
play basketball with him. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that as Goring pleaded for his life, Grigsby shot him again in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
The second victim, Raymond Rodriguez, ran from his apartment to see what the 
commotion was about. He was shot in the head as he bent over Goring, trying to 
help him. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Clay Peters said Grigsby apparently did not know Goring. 
Peters offered no theory to jurors about why Grigsby would shoot Goring. He 
argued, however, that Grigsby shot Rodriguez to prevent him from being a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Doddy said many witnesses during the trial offered 
vague or contradictory identifications or were too far away to see clearly who 
wielded the shotgun that killed the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Doddy also argued that Grigsby could not have been the gunman because he had 
been involved in a hit-and-run accident four blocks away from the apartment 
complex at roughly the same time the shootings took place. 
</P>
<P>
Peters told jurors that there was enough of a time span between the accident 
and the shooting for Grigsby to have returned to his apartment complex, grab 
the gun in his apartment and shoot the two men. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial's penalty phase, doctors testified for the defense that 
Grigsby was a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome because his mother drank heavily 
while she was pregnant with him. 
</P>
<P>
Doddy said Grigsby suffers from manic-depression. As an example of his problem, 
the lawyer said Grigsby required special counseling to control himself 
sufficiently to sit through the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Francis Hourigan scheduled sentencing for Oct. 12. Peters said he would 
appeal Grigsby's conviction at that time.

TORRANCE COUNCIL REJECTS CHANGES OFFERED BY LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An effort to change the Torrance City Charter and revise how City Council 
members get paid was firmly rebuffed Tuesday by a committee of council members 
who say they remain unconvinced that major changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance League of Women Voters had called for the review, saying that some 
sections of the charter are obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
A league report described the current method of paying council members as 
misleading, and it urged limiting council members to two four-year terms. All 
seven current City Council members have served at least one term. 
</P>
<P>
The league arguments failed to sway the council committee charged with studying 
the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see chaos in the city because of problems in the charter," said 
Councilman Mark Wirth, one of the committee's three members. 
</P>
<P>
League leaders expressed chagrin at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's not interesting to them. It's not sexy," said Jeanette 
Pierson, who chaired the league's charter review group. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, also, they don't want to see those issues opened up," added league 
President Lynitta Schaffer, citing members' pay and term limits. "We're not 
necessarily surprised, but disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Schaffer could not predict Tuesday what her group will do in the face of the 
committee decision. 
</P>
<P>
The council committee unanimously recommended against the league request for a 
thorough charter review by a citizens' panel. Members did say they would be 
willing look at individual concerns that the league chooses to bring to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
The full City Council will act on the recommendation, probably in the next two 
weeks, said Councilwoman Dee Hardison, chairwoman of the Employee Relations and 
Department Organization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-member Torrance league has successfully suggested some charter changes 
in the past. It made its latest recommendations in mid-June after a yearlong 
study of the charter, which is the basic document outlining city operations. 
Mayor Katy Geissert referred the matter to Hardison's committee. 
</P>
<P>
One major recommendation would have struck the charter provision for paying 
council members $100 a month. The league instead believes that council salaries 
should be set each year during the annual budget process. 
</P>
<P>
League members called the $100 salary misleading because it does not reflect 
the other ways that council members are reimbursed, such as a flat monthly $410 
car allowance and reimbursements of up to $250 in expenses monthly. 
</P>
<P>
But council members said Tuesday they are reluctant to wade into the subject of 
council compensation. Councilman Dan Walker said he disagrees that the current 
method of compensation needs reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get into one giant brouhaha, any way you cut it," Walker said. 
"There's no reason to open up that conflict in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Council members were also cool toward the idea of limiting themselves to two 
four-year terms. The league had suggested the limit in the hope of encouraging 
more people to run for council seats. In the March, 1990, election, only one 
challenger emerged to run against three incumbents for three seats; the 
challenger lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The two-term limit is a very hard issue. It certainly has pluses, and it 
certainly has minuses," Hardison said in an interview Wednesday. "I think it's 
a shame we don't have more people involved. . . . People do beat out 
incumbents, but you have to do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
Hardison added, however, "I don't see the council (members) wanting to put 
those limits on themselves." And, she pointed out, the mayor is now limited to 
two terms. "We do have turnover every eight years because our mayor does not 
return." 
</P>
<P>
One league concern did stir some mild interest, that of whether the city clerk 
and treasurer should be appointed, rather than elected, as they are today. City 
Clerk John A. Bramhall wants the City Council to appoint the clerk, just as it 
appoints the city manager and city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be something the council will have some discussions on," 
Hardison said.

HERMOSA BEACH SAYS NO TO CYCLE SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the satisfaction of residents fighting the opening of a motorcycle sales and 
parts store on Pacific Coast Highway, the Hermosa Beach City Council this week 
delayed for at least six months any possibility that the owners of South Bay 
Cycles will be able to sell Harley-Davidsons at their shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just plain discrimination against bikers," said Maiko Saravia, who, with 
co-owner William Campbell, had planned to run an upscale, pink-walled 
"motorcycle boutique," specializing in Harley-Davidson sales, in a building at 
640 Pacific Coast Highway that had been an auto parts and sales store. 
</P>
<P>
Saravia and Campbell said they had been assured by city staff that they would 
have no problem obtaining permission to sell motorcycles at their shop, since 
the city's General Plan allowed auto sales -- a similar use -- on that strip of 
the highway. Moreover, the owners noted, their store is flanked by auto 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners near the commercial strip objected vehemently, contending that 
the area is already noisy enough without the roar of revving engines that would 
surely accompany the opening of South Bay Cycles. The uproar -- including 
opposition by the wife of former Planning Commissioner Jerry Compton -- 
prompted the Planning Commission last week to deny Saravia and Campbell the 
conditional use permit they needed. 
</P>
<P>
Saravia and Campbell had intended to appeal that decision to the City Council 
next month. Having invested nearly $250,000 in building renovations, the owners 
said they are losing about $7,000 a month in mortgage and overhead because of 
the delays. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, the council decided that the General Plan should be amended to 
specifically include -- or disallow -- motorcycle sales on that section of the 
highway. Such amendments require public hearings and legal procedures that 
normally take months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong difference between motorcycles and cars -- the noise level," 
Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roger Creighton noted too that there are no other motorcycle stores 
in the area, nor have there been in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relatively new use for the area," he said, "and it's a use that needs 
to be reviewed and stringent standards set." 
</P>
<P>
But Saravia said the city's public officials are persecuting his business at 
the behest of a political crony. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be something illegal about this," he said, adding that he is 
considering a lawsuit against the city.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer who was ordering a meal at a 
drive-through fast-food restaurant in Inglewood was shot in the hand Tuesday 
when he attempted to break up a robbery attempt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Darell Matthews, 25, a rookie assigned to patrol duty at the Van Nuys Station, 
was listed in good condition at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital with a bullet 
wound to the left hand. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was waiting at the drive-through window at Church's Fried Chicken on 
Century Boulevard shortly after 9 p.m. when a man walked up to the window with 
a revolver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews tried to knock down the suspect with the door of his car and then 
attempted to disarm the man. During the struggle, the gunman fired once and 
fled. Matthews fired at the suspect with his own handgun but missed. The gunman 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's officer-involved shooting team is assisting 
Inglewood police in the investigation.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHELDON TAKES OVER AS MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach got a new mayor this week, as City Councilman Chuck Sheldon took 
the gavel for a nine-month stint in the largely ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, who has been a councilman for three years, was next in line for the 
rotating position, which until Tuesday was held by his fellow council member, 
Roger Creighton. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Creighton for for having "conducted himself as mayor with 
tremendous eclat," Sheldon promised to keep the interests of the city as a 
whole in mind. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Sheldon also said he will stress "manners" during his 
mayoral stint. In the past, residents at odds with the council on various 
issues have accused council members of contentiousness and rudeness and have 
complained that the council discourages public input by limiting time at the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
"I will have no place in my administration for disorderly conduct and poor 
manners," Sheldon said. "There's a gracious way to move meetings along such 
that you don't aggravate heated situations and stimulate negative comment."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT AGAINST MOBIL SET FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of the lawsuit filed against Mobil Oil Corp. by the city of Torrance 
is set to begin Nov. 5, and the city attorney predicts it could last six to 
eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The date was set by Superior Court Judge Gary Hastings at a Tuesday conference 
of attorneys in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is part of a continuing controversy over the safety of Mobil's 
refinery in northeast Torrance. Public attention was focused on the refinery 
after a series of accidents, including a massive explosion in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The city sued Mobil in April, 1989, claiming the refinery is a public nuisance 
and seeking the power to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said Wednesday that although the parties have 
discussed a settlement, "We're still pretty far apart." Mobil attorneys were 
not available for comment.

KIDD FEELS AS IF HE HAS THE WIND AT HIS BACK; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: NEW TEAM, NEW CLIMATE SUIT PUNTER FINE AFTER HIS EXPERIENCES AT 
NORTHWESTERN AND IN BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The return trip was five hours, and usually it was very quiet.John Kidd's 
family was certainly loyal. 
</P>
<P>
Every home game in the fall, his mother, Carolyn, his father, Max, and his 
little sister, Janet, would jump in the car and drive 300 miles from Findlay, 
Ohio, to Evanston, Ill., to watch John play football for Northwestern. Every 
week, Northwestern lost. There was never much to talk about on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980 and 1981, John's freshman and sophomore seasons, Northwestern didn't 
win a game. The football team was the punch line to nearly every campus joke. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the Kidd who had gotten so many slaps on the back as the 
quarterback of the Findlay High School football team, who had decided to go to 
a not-so-high-powered college football program so he could continue to play 
quarterback, had been relegated to full-time punting duties and wasn't being 
considered for the starting quarterback position. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade later, Kidd has punted his way to San Diego, where he will play 
his first season as a Charger. The dearth of wins at Northwestern didn't stop 
him, and neither did the the abundance of wind in six NFL seasons in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
If Kidd, 29, were the type of guy to get really upset every time something went 
wrong, he probably would have quit football long ago. Measured in victories, 
his career has undoubtedly more downs than ups. 
</P>
<P>
As if playing football for Northwestern weren't enough of a headache, Kidd was 
drafted by the Bills in 1984. During many games, 50-m.p.h. winds would blow in 
his face, and he would do his best to keep the ball low so it wouldn't die in 
the air. On a day like that, a 28-yard average wasn't bad. At least, not until 
he checked what the guys on the West Coast were doing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a 28-yard average and the punter you go against has an 18-yard 
average, and you feel like you've had a great day," Kidd said. "But then 
everybody out here has a 45-yard average. It's tough to keep up with the Jonses 
when you're in Buffalo eight games a year." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kidd has a career average of 40.5 yards a punt, and he set an NFL record 
in 1985 with 33 kicks inside the 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is, Kidd was almost California bound. During his senior year, 
the San Francisco 49ers often phoned to express interest. Then, on draft day, 
the called to tell him he was about to be their next selection. The phone rang 
again five minutes later. It was the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
So, after four years at Northwestern, the first two of them winless, he went 
Buffalo, which didn't exactly have a winning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won the Super Bowl that season. The Bills went 2-14. The next season 
they also went 2-14. 
</P>
<P>
Unbelievable, yes. Unbearable, no -- not for a guy with Kidd's temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside factors don't get to him as much as other players," said Janet 
Stewart, Kidd's younger sister. "He can take a lot of things in stride. Things 
just don't rattle him." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean there aren't things that concern him about playing 
professional football. He would just as soon the NFL reconsider the rule that 
gives officials the option to make "roughing the punter" a five-yard penalty 
rather than a 15-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's fourth and more than five, you're going to get rushed," he says. "Kids 
go to camps and learn the 152 steps to become a great punter. All that stuff 
goes out the window when you have 10 guys that run 4.5 (in the 40-yard dash) 
coming at you." 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, a player came flying in and cut him at the knees on a punt. 
The official blew the whistle and assessed a five-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd said to him: "That's got to be a 15-yard penalty." The official responded: 
"You're not hurt." 
</P>
<P>
"So I guess you have to have knee surgery to get a 15-yard penalty," he says. 
"To me, it's not fair to protect the quarterbacks like they do and then turn 
everybody loose on the punter." 
</P>
<P>
Fans aren't always fair, either. After one game his rookie season, Kidd was 
walking off the field after a Bills' loss reassuring himself that if he kept 
his punting at a high level it eventually would help the team win. It was about 
then that somebody from the stands yelled: "Hey, Kidd, you (stink)." 
</P>
<P>
"It's irrelevant if you have a good game or a bad game," he says. "People just 
want you to win. So that was a good early lesson." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills went 12-4 in 1988 and advanced to the AFC Championship Game, which 
they lost to Cincinnati. That was the first winning team for which Kidd had 
played since his junior year in high school in 1978, when Findlay High went 
7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Because Kidd has proven effective in adverse situations, and because his 
quarterbacking background shows versatility, the Chargers went after him when 
he became available as a Plan B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, punters have often been the subject of snide remarks because of 
there non-athletic appearance. Larry Pasquale, the Chargers' special teams 
coach, says punting became so specialized that the position often was filled 
with players who weren't capable of doing anything but kicking. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the flakiness titles came in," Pasquale says. "But now punters 
and kickers are more versatile. They're better athletes. They train, they lift 
weights, they run." 
</P>
<P>
And Kidd does all of those. Growing up, he divided his time among every sport 
imaginable, including long hours playing hockey. Little sister Janet would wait 
around the rink just to carry his hockey stick for him when he went home. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his early seasons in Buffalo, Kidd was a big shot around 
Findlay. That got old for Janet, who was always referred to as John's little 
sister by her teachers. (One year, on his birthday, she made a pitch for her 
own identity by giving him a T-shirt that said: "Janet's brother.") 
</P>
<P>
These days, as the Chargers prepare for the regular season opener at Dallas 
Sept. 9, Janet's brother is impressing a lot of people with his knowledge of 
the game and his willingness to work. Most days, Kidd is one of the last 
players to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
"John's always alert, always thinking about his job," Pasquale says. "You don't 
have to look for John to work. He's always around. He's always making sure that 
everything is clear." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a chore. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy what I do," he says. "so from that aspect, it makes it a lot of fun."

Some fringe players have caught the eye of Charger management enough that their 
places on the roster should be secure when the final cut to 47 players comes 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada-Reno's Henry Rolling, a free-agent linebacker who played in parts of the 
1988 and 1989 seasons for Tampa Bay, has made some kind of impression on Coach 
Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like this Rolling," Henning said on the day the Chargers broke camp 
at UC San Diego and moved their belonging out of the dorm there. "He looks like 
a pretty good linebacker to me. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very pleasant surprise. When you get a guy like him from another team, 
who has tools and intelligence, you always wonder, 'Hey, something's wrong. 
Why's he here?' He's certainly passed the test of training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Another defensive player who has made the Chargers do double- and triple-takes 
is cornerback Donald Frank, a rookie free agent who started last Saturday 
against the 49ers in place of Gill Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Frank, out of Winston-Salem State, has been a highlight of camp 
but not the biggest surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald has shown up to be pretty capable in the secondary," Henning said. "He 
has a long way to go, but while he's getting there, he's going to help us." 
</P>
<P>
Another presence is cornerback Joe Fuller of Northern Iowa, a sixth-round draft 
pick who intercepted a pass by Joe Montana in the Chargers' 29-28 victory over 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, (Frank and Fuller) are coming along," Beathard said. "The coaches 
certainly feel they're better than the backups last year." 
</P>
<P>
Special teams have improved dramatically, and Henning said some players on the 
borderline have made sparkling special teams plays to draw attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much more stable in the special teams than we were," he said. "Of 
course, we picked up some different people than we had last year in the same 
spots. They're smarter, they're younger, their quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Nate Lewis, a wide receiver out of Oregon Tech, has done a fine job on kick 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
"He has come on pretty strong in this camp," Henning said. "I was disappointed 
with him in Phoenix (during scrimmages), but he's been looking good in 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard was talking about the first-year players, the 
rookies, the unproven and how some players who seem to be goners could change 
coaches' minds either during the little remaining pre-cut practice time or 
Saturday's exhibition finale against the Raiders in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids are still coming up, some kids have leveled off, and some kids are 
on their way down," he said. "But this is their last test, and I hate to write 
them off." 
</P>
<P>
While the Chargers try and address the areas that need the most improvement, 
there's a certain fire that can sometimes make up for little deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of questions," Beathard said, "but they've played well. 
There's a lot of spirit. Sometimes when you have a lot of spirit and you play 
hard -- that goes not just the Chargers but for any team -- you cover up some 
weaknesses sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Make way: Wide receiver Elliott Searcy was waived Wednesday to make room on the 
60-man roster for offensive guard Mike Zandofsky, who was acquired Tuesday from 
Phoenix for a low draft choice. Zandofsky was expected to join the team late 
Wednesday . . . Despite losing 35 pounds in the off-season, Coach Dan Henning 
will dream of the training table offerings, especially the giant-sized 
chocolate chip cookies. "I'm going to miss you boys," he said as he munched his 
last cookie of training camp 1990.

FORMER LION STANDOUT IS ARMED, READY TO MAKE A MAJOR LEAGUE MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY ZEPEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After almost five seasons in the minor leagues, Jim Bruske is finally making 
his big pitch for a job in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
His former coach at Loyola Marymount University, Dave Snow, always told Bruske 
that his ticket to the major leagues was as a pitcher. Fortunately, or maybe 
unfortunately as he develops his pitching skills, the Antelope Valley native 
was also a good hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Always noted for his strong throwing arm, Snow used Bruske in right field. That 
way, Bruske could hit four or five times a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions went on to win the West Coast Conference championship in 1986 and 
traveled to Omaha for the school's only appearance in at the College World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Bruske was selected outstanding player of the NCAA West Regional that season 
when he hit four home runs and drove in 11 runs in the five-game tournament. In 
54 games that season, he batted .321 with 12 home runs and 50 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Snow also used Bruske in the starting rotation, but the right-hander injured 
his throwing hand in an early season start against Cal State Fullerton and saw 
limited opportunities as a pitcher. Bruske was 3-1 with a 4.56 earned-run 
average for the eight games in which he pitched. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Indians, who drafted Bruske in the first round of the second 
phase of the major league draft in 1986, made note of Bruske's offensive 
contributions to the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Bruske joined the Indians organization in mid-season in 1986 as an outfielder, 
alternating between right and center field. That was the routine until a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Just prior to Instructional League play at Baseball City, Fla., in September, 
the Indians told Bruske of the decision to let him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mutual decision (to try pitching), in that I said I'd go to 
Instructional League and find out if I was capable of pitching in double A," 
Bruske said. "I did pretty well. Learned a lot, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
It has paid off with a winning record for the Eastern League affiliate of the 
Indians. Bruske, 25, has an 8-2 record, two complete game shutouts, and a 3.57 
ERA in 103 innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching-poor Indians might call him up for the final month of the season, 
or have him join them for spring training in March. 
</P>
<P>
Bruske knew he would need some refinement, so he reported to Baseball City 
following the '89 season to work on his pitching flaws. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically I started from the beginning (as a pitcher)," said Bruske, who has 
pitched in 30 games this season, 11 in the starting rotation. "Mechanics-wise, 
I was not even close to what I should have been. The pitching coach there, Will 
George, really helped me a lot. And he still is." 
</P>
<P>
George handles the Canton-Akron (Ohio) pitchers, as well as those in the 
organization's instructional league. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Bruske was named the Eastern League outfielder with the best 
throwing arm in a poll of observers by the monthly publication, Baseball 
America. So he knew he could throw hard. But he might have been trying to get 
the ball to home plate too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had trouble rushing everything out with my pitching motion," Bruske 
said. "Few coaches had ever worked on my mechanics before, although Coach Snow 
did a little bit at Loyola. I was always worried about hitting more than 
pitching back in my college days." 
</P>
<P>
Bruske hit .406 his sophomore at Antelope Valley Community College and 
impressed scouts enough to get selected by the San Diego Padres in the seventh 
round of the January 1985 draft. He was also selected by the Seattle Mariners 
in the third round of the June 1985 draft. 
</P>
<P>
He also pitched at Antelope Valley and struck out 101 batters in 69 innings 
with a 2.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Snow initially listed Bruske as a pitcher on the Loyola roster. When Snow 
called on him to relieve in the '86 regional victory over UCLA, Bruske 
responded with 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief -- allowing only one hit -- 
and was the winning hurler. 
</P>
<P>
The current Loyola baseball coach, Chris Smith, Snow's top assistant in 1986, 
said that Bruske was one of the best all-around athletes the team has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
"He is such a good athlete, it was difficult call as to what position was his 
best," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Indians signed Bruske, his destiny seemed to be as an outfielder. 
During his first three professional seasons, he played for rookie league and 
Class A teams at Batavia and Kingston (N.Y.) and double-A teams at Williamsport 
(Penn.). His highest was .243 at Batavia. At the start of the '89 season, the 
Indians demoted him back to Kingston, and he hit .290 with five home runs and 
38 RBIs in 63 games. He was promoted to Canton-Akron, but didn't get much 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, but I was having the best year of my career (as a hitter)," Bruske 
said. "They wanted me to go back to Kingston and get my confidence level up and 
hit for a higher average. I got called up to Canton and started off well there, 
too. I was doing well, but the next thing I knew, I was only in the lineup two 
times a week and my average started to drop." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruske has always remembered what Snow told him about his best chance of 
making it to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess, right now, I'm throwing in the high 80s," Bruske said. "I'm working 
on a change-up right now. That's what I have to throw for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, his repertoire of pitches included only a fastball and a slider. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Indians) are trying to get more of our pitchers to throw the split-finger 
fastball," Bruske said. "At this point, they haven't mentioned it to me yet, 
but I expect that when I'm at the instructional league in September, they 
probably will." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Bruske's '86 Loyola Marymount teammates have already played in the major 
leagues -- Cincinnati Red relief pitcher Tim Layana and Dodger outfielder Billy 
Bean. Bean is currently playing for the Dodgers' top minor-league squad at 
Albuquerque, N.M., but played half the '89 season with the Dodgers and parts of 
'87 and '88 with the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"After 4 1/2 years (of trying), I still love it," Bruske said. "But it's a job, 
and you learn that. I don't miss hitting as much as I thought I would." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't like all aspects of life in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus rides from town to town on road trips are pretty brutal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few seasons, he's hit against Layana in the Eastern League. 
</P>
<P>
"I faced him 10 times -- didn't do too well, but I hit the ball pretty hard a 
few times," Bruske said. 
</P>
<P>
This season he's pitched to Loyola alumni Bobby DeJardin and Don Sparks, 
playing in the New York Yankees' organization at Albany, N.Y. After the season 
is over, and each of the Loyola baseball alumni have returned to Southern 
California, they stay in shape by working out together at Loyola.

BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA?;

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S COMMITMENT TO WOMEN'S ATHLETICS GETS FIRST TEST; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: LIONS HAVE THEIR FIRST FULL-TIME COACH AS THEY OPEN SEASON AGAINST 
MURRAY STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Steve Stratos is cautiously optimistic as the Loyola Marymount women's 
volleyball team opens its season on Saturday, and the university also hopes it 
will be the beginning of a new era in women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Stratos, the third Loyola Marymount women's volleyball coach in three years, is 
the Lions' first full-time coach. The athletic department has made a commitment 
to women's athletics and is slowly increasing scholarship levels in an attempt 
to make the Lions competitive with top teams in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola will take the Gersten Pavilion floor for the 7:30 p.m. match with Murray 
State with several returning players from last year, notably All-WCC outside 
hitter Kerry House. The 5-foot-8 senior was the Lions' leader in kills, kill 
attempts and attack percentage and set a school record for digs. 
</P>
<P>
Also returning are senior setter Anita Irwin, who accounted for 661 assists, 
and middle blockers Dana Bragado and Stacy Trapp. Bragado, a 6-foot sophomore 
with star potential, will miss at least the first two matches with a knee 
injury. Trapp, a 5-9 senior, will start in Bragado's place and figures to be a 
key player off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Stratos, 37, who was coach at Woodbridge High in Irvine, has also brought in 
the nucleus for the future. Freshman Deanna Doolittle, the Orange County Female 
Athlete of the Year at Woodbridge, will team with House at outside hitter. 
Shawna Mickartz, a freshman from Irvine High, is scheduled to start in the 
sixth spot although she's been suffering from a back injury, and junior Lisa 
Wenker, a 5-11 transfer from El Camino College, will start at middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer, 5-11 freshman middle blocker Teri Runge, has considerable 
promise but has been ill. She has yet to practice. Also on the roster are 
senior setters Loren Newman, who returns as Irwin's backup, and Janiece 
Stimpfig, who lost most of last season to a knee injury; sophomore hitter Jill 
Sutton, an occasional starter last year; sophomore blocker Theresa Matus, a 
transfer from Cal State Northridge; and freshman hitter Katie Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"The infusion of new people and additional scholarships next year . . . will 
have a dramatic impact on the program," Stratos said. "We think we can attract 
a lot of good athletes and will be much improved next year. You're as good as 
the people you put on the floor. We think it's going to happen, and pretty 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Brian Quinn, who hired Stratos, said the move was the 
cornerstone of an upgrading of the entire women's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions were 8-19 last year under Mike Normand, now the full-time men's 
coach. They were outmatched in non-conference competition and not deep enough 
to offset several injuries -- which could be a problem this season. In WCC 
play, they were 7-7. Perennial conference champion Pepperdine has already been 
tabbed the favorite, with Gonzaga second. Stratos would like to make it more 
than a two-team race. 
</P>
<P>
"Pepperdine's the team to beat," he said. "We feel we'll be able to play with 
people, and surprise a lot of people. That's the goal, to become competitive 
right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Stratos is known for defensive expertise. "We are not a large team but we are a 
defensive team," he said. "We're emphasizing our 'D' (and) back row defense is 
something we are working on." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the group of recruits, two more new faces in the program are 
Stratos' assistants, Larry Smoot, his top assistant, and Pam Lawrence, a 
graduate assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got two terrific assistants," Stratos said. "Larry's the head of the 
South Bay Volleyball Club and Pam's fiance is head of the Orange County 
Volleyball Club, so we have some very important contacts. And their knowledge 
of the game is so good they've immediately gotten the attention and respect of 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the early schedule will test the inexperienced Lions. Tenth-rated UC 
Santa Barbara visits Gersten Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. By the end of 
September, the Lions will have played 12th-ranked Cal State Long Beach, the 
defending national champion, and No. 1 UCLA. In early October, they visit 
16th-rated San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
But Stratos hopes to be on a par with those teams in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the university has definitely made a commitment," he said. "One of the 
aspects has been to bring in a full-time coach for the first time. They've done 
some other things . . . that has communicated (to the players) the school is 
dedicated to upgrading the program. That has lent itself to an increased effort 
on their part. I think we can attract a lot of good athletes . . . (I think) 
the people out there, the recruits will see there is a difference and want to 
come here." 
</P>
<P>
If the new commitment and enthusiasm translate into victories, the Lions' rise 
could be Stratos-pheric.

Practice has never been this perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving here Sunday, Canyon High and Montclair Prep have practiced at 
Kapiolani Park in balmy 85-degree temperatures accompanied by a refreshing 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the park's east side, Diamond Head crater rises ominously. To 
the south, Waikiki Beach beckons. To the north lie rolling green hills and the 
Oahu countryside. To the west, the city of Honolulu and its temptations. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi arrived Tuesday afternoon and worked out that evening under the lights 
and on the artificial turf of the University of Hawaii practice field. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon conducted two-a-days Monday and Tuesday. Montclair Prep practiced twice 
Monday and once Tuesday. All three teams had light workouts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Color commentary: Canyon's practice jerseys each are decorated with a rainbow 
on the sleeves, similar to the uniforms of the University of Hawaii team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my idea, I hope it wasn't too frivolous," said Harry Welch, Canyon's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon has more activities planned than either Crespi or Montclair Prep. The 
Cowboys have taken tours of the USS Arizona Memorial and a naval base. 
</P>
<P>
They also saw an elaborate Polynesian show Tuesday night and will take a bus 
ride around Oahu's North Shore today. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus tour on game day is deliberate," Welch said. "I don't want the kids 
laying on the beach all day. This way, they'll be sitting on an air-conditioned 
bus." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi toured the Dole Cannery on Wednesday. The Montclair Prep players have 
spent most of their non-practice time at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Turf talk: The synthetic surface at Aloha Stadium was replaced a month ago. 
Kahuku and St. Louis, Hawaiian teams that play Crespi and Canyon tonight, 
opened their season Saturday with victories at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The turf is nice and springy, and it's easy to make cuts," said Doug Semones, 
the Kahuku coach. "It might make for some breakaway runs." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 10,600 attended Saturday's games. Skip Akina, organizer of today's 
Shawn Akina Memorial Classic, expects about 15,000 for the Canyon-St.Louis 
finale.

SOCKERS' QUINN MIGHT ADD COACHING DUTIES

Socker midfielder Brian Quinn likely will have something over his teammates 
when the Major Soccer League season begins Oct. 19 -- a job as one of their 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
A contract has not been signed, but Quinn and Coach Ron Newman confirmed the 
team has offered Quinn, considered one of the MSL's best players, an 
opportunity to become an assistant coach as well. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement would not only add to Quinn's responsibilities, it would add to 
his paycheck, which would have been drastically cut under the league's new 
salary cap of $630,000 per team. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, 30, earned $60,000 last season and, along with defender Kevin Crow, had 
the team's third-highest salary behind forward Branko Segota ($102,000) and 
goalie Zoltan Toth ($68,000). Quinn wouldn't give specifics but said this 
year's player/coach salary will "be very close" to what he earned last year. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sticking point. Owners have yet to agree on parameters regarding 
player/coach salaries under the new cap. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Commissioner Earl Foreman faxed a ballot to each league member to 
decide whether such a loophole should be created, according to John Griffin, 
MSL director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
A final count is not expected until next week, but other teams have already 
taken the same detour around the cap. In Cleveland, midfielder Kai Haaskivi 
also serves as head coach. Goalkeeper Chris Sobieski of Dallas and defender Joe 
Waters of Tacoma are entering their second years as assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Griffin said, St. Louis is trying to work a similar deal with defender 
Fernando Clavijo, and Kansas City is toying with the idea of creating a 
player/coach position. 
</P>
<P>
That's six teams, a sound majority in an eight-team league. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, known for a tenacious style of play, said he didn't want his new title 
to be a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take a coaching position just to be a figurehead," he said. "I 
would like to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he looked forward to such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect his views," Newman said. "He has got the makeup to become an 
excellent coach when he decides to hang up his boots." 
</P>
<P>
Newman went on to say that as team captain, Quinn already serves in a role 
similar to that of a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I would always confer with Brian," Newman said. "But now I'll definitely 
discuss things with Brian more than before. In the past I didn't want to put 
too much pressure on him as a player." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said Quinn's appointment will not affect Erich Geyer, who will continue 
as an assistant.

COME PLAYOFF TIME, EAST TEAMS USUALLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY

<P>
The coaches in the City Eastern League probably would like to come right out 
and say it, but they won't. 
</P>
<P>
They agree that, with its recent success, theirs has become the best Division 
3-A football league in the San Diego Section. But they'd rather let the numbers 
do the bragging. 
</P>
<P>
Such talk will bring a cold wind from the north, where the Palomar League has 
produced four section champions and four runners-up in 11 years and a football 
phenomenon in Rancho Buena Vista, a team that has won 28 games in its first 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It will cause a heat wave in the valley, where Helix of the 3-A Grossmont 
League has remained a dominant force with its .773 winning percentage the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
And such a notion naturally causes an uprising in the south, where Chula Vista 
of the Metro Conference has kept pace with Helix the past half decade and 
Sweetwater has produced more victories (194) than any other 3-A team over the 
past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
But no league can boast three better teams in the past five years than the City 
Eastern's Morse (.725 winning percentage), Point Loma (.684) and Mira Mesa 
(.660). All rank among the top six in the county during that time. In the 1989 
section playoffs, these three combined to produce more victories, seven, than 
any other 3-A league. And all three reached the semifinals, where Morse beat 
Mira Mesa, 18-13, and Point Loma was eliminated by RBV. 
</P>
<P>
Could such a thing happen again in 1990? Anyone who has followed the Eastern 
the past few seasons should know by now to expect it. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is capable of doing that again this year," said Serra Coach Skip 
Coons. "I feel we're that strong." 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar may own four section championships -- the most by any 3-A league 
since the game's inception in 1979 -- but the Eastern is gaining. While the 
Palomar has provided a champion and runner-up the past two years, the Eastern 
has produced two of each in the same time and three champions and three 
runners-up since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 playoffs, Eastern teams finished 7-4. The Palomar, thanks to RBV's 
four victories, was 6-4. The Metro went 2-4 and Grossmont 0-3. Morse, Point 
Loma and Mira Mesa were a combined 6-2 and outscored their opponents by an 
average of 33-17 in postseason. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the records, and we've kind of dominated," said Ed Shoen, Mira 
Mesa's defensive coordinator. "We have bigger, stronger, faster athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma's Bennie Edens and Morse's John Shacklett, who have served a 
combined 56 years as head coaches at those schools, claim one reason for the 
league's postseason success stems from the Eastern style of play -- tough and 
physical. Eastern team don't feel as if they've played a game unless they walk 
away with bruises and broken equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like the way we play," Shacklett said. "We tend to run more than 
pass. Ball control is very important. Year in and year out, the teams that win 
tend to be physical." 
</P>
<P>
Added Edens: "I don't mean to downgrade anybody, but the three teams (Point 
Loma, Morse and Mira Mesa) in the Eastern League can beat anybody on a given 
night." 
</P>
<P>
And it has always been that way. Morse (.650), Patrick Henry (.593), and Point 
Loma (.588) have three of the nine best records over the past 25 years. Morse 
has been a winner in all but six of those years. Mira Mesa, which started 
playing varsity football in 1977, has had 10 winning seasons in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry has suffered through four losing seasons the past five years but 
before that was .500 or better in 16 of 18 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern is 14-9 against non-league 3-A opponents over the past two regular 
seasons. In 1989, including playoff games, Mira Mesa finished 5-1 against 3-A 
teams from other leagues and won by an average score of 20-8. Morse was 3-3 
(4-2 after an RBV victory was forfeited) and Point Loma 4-3, including 
victories over RBV and Los Angeles City 4-A champion Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern teams are not ducking anybody, either. Morse, Serra, Point Loma and 
Mira Mesa alone have scheduled 18 non-league games against 1989 playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Eastern League) will always have three teams in the playoffs," said 
Shacklett, who has won two section titles at Morse. "It's unusual to have three 
in the semifinals. But let's put it this way, I think it'll happen more than it 
won't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CITY EAST LEAGUE FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion: Morse (11-3 in 1989, 5-0 in league). 
</P>
<P>
Who should win: Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Who could win: Mira Mesa (9-4, 3-2), Point Loma (8-5, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Who should look toward 1991: Patrick Henry (4-7, 1-4), Serra (3-7, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
The Game: Morse at Mira Mesa, Nov. 9. This is the final game of the regular 
season for both teams, and both could be undefeated in league going in. 
</P>
<P>
Impact players: Teddy Lawrence, Morse, senior quarterback, 5-11, 177; rushed 
for 206 yards and three touchdowns and passed for 112 yards and three TDs in 
team's first game last week. Wayne Pittman, Mira Mesa, senior fullback, 6-0, 
200; will lead run-oriented offense, rushed for over 1,300 yards last year. 
Marlon Manassa, Point Loma, senior running back, 5-11, 175; despite team's 
passing offense, he rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
New faces: Laroi Glover, Point Loma, junior defensive end, 6-2, 260; Gary 
Taylor, Morse, junior running back, 5-11, 170; Robbie Edwards, Mira Mesa, 
junior running back, 6-1, 190. 
</P>
<P>
Last word: With the departure of Madison to the City Central League, the 
Eastern is now the only Division 3-A league with as few as five teams. The 
league champion has reached the section championship game each of the past 
three seasons, winning two. 
</P>
<P>
THE BEASTS OF THE EAST? 
</P>
<P>
Top six winning percentages among county 3-A teams over the past five years, 
including playoff games. Note: Rancho Buena Vista (.777) has existed only three 
seasons, one in 3-A.

ANTSY AZTECS FEEL LIKE HITTING SOMEONE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of the San Diego State football team after the Aztecs finished their 
final scrimmage of the fall Wednesday was clear -- they are looking forward to 
facing some team, any team, other than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill said the Aztecs are "getting better," and he liked the fact 
that the offense had to work dutifully to produce against a hard-hitting 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
But how many sound judgments can you make based on playing each other? Nickel 
back Derrick Williams had a good scrimmage, blocking a field goal attempt and 
an extra point attempt (along with a sack), but Luginbill wasn't sure whether 
to criticize the field goal unit or praise Williams. Luginbill started one way, 
shifted directions and, finally, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week, I get to root for us," he said, smiling. "I've got to field a field 
goal team that's supposed to be secure enough, and I've got a field goal block 
team that's busting their tail to block it. I've got to feel good about the 
block, but then I feel bad that we're terrible at protection. So we've got to 
come to some meeting of the minds and get it straightened out. If something 
happens like that with the defensive kicking game, more than likely you're in 
trouble in a football game." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tommy Booker was excused from Wednesday's scrimmage and from a 
practice next week to take care of some personal matters. Booker was the 
leading rusher in the Aug. 22 scrimmage, gaining 84 yards and a touchdown on 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Kipp Jefferies gained 81 yards on 19 carries Wednesday. Luginbill said he 
hasn't made a determination as to how his four leading running backs stack up 
on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
"Kipp is Kipp," Luginbill said. "He keeps coming at you. You think you've got 
him and he bounces away." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies said he was happy with his performance, he still has room to improve 
and, no, he is not yet thinking about his place on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of that will be resolved until maybe (next week)," Jefferies 
said. "Right now, it's still a tussle." 
</P>
<P>
T.C. Wright, the transfer from Mesa (Ariz.) Community College who finished 
spring as No. 1, carried only three times for 12 yards. Luginbill said Wright 
had a slight shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Butts, who was doubtful with a hip pointer, carried five times for 66 
yards, including a 44-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he saw continued improvement in the Aztec defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for the counter, we did play the run better than last Wednesday," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he doesn't think individuals should catch the coach's 
attention on defense -- "it should be the entire defense" -- he was impressed 
with linebacker Andy Coviello. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy runs all over the field and makes plays," Luginbill said. "He's 
constantly attacking the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Coviello (6-feet, 215 pounds) is a transfer from Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a defensive back's speed," Luginbill said. "He's a collision player and 
a leaper. He plays the game hard. When the play is done, he's up and ready to 
go again." 
</P>
<P>
Spectators were shaking their heads at the SDSU kickoff and punt teams, 
figuring new year, same stuff. The Aztec kickoff team gave up three long 
returns to Keith Williams -- 30, 33 and 34 yards, and the punt team allowed 
returns of 35 and 29 yards to Jimmy Raye. 
</P>
<P>
Not to panic, Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the kickoff team, the Aztecs have previously returned kicks one way in 
practice, and the coverage team figured that would continue to be the case 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we returned either way and they had a difficult time with it," Luginbill 
said. "They played where they thought the ball was going to go. They thought 
(the kickoff return team) was going to its left." 
</P>
<P>
It can be corrected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The punts were returned against coverage meant to simulate Oregon rather than 
the actual SDSU coverage team. 
</P>
<P>
"Those punt returns were against our 'look' team," Luginbill said. "They 
weren't (No. 1s against No. 1s)." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire completed nine of 16 passes for 96 yards and a 
touchdown, of five yards to Jimmy Raye. . . . Patrick Rowe, who caught two 
passes for 32 yards, was the leading receiver. . . . About an hour into the 
scrimmage, just as the Aztec punt team was getting ready to kick the ball away, 
SDSU Coach Al Luginbill interrupted things and called everyone over to the 
bench for a lecture. Turns out there were just 10 men on the field. "This is a 
first-class program, and I want it to be known that our guys can count to 11," 
he said. "Obviously, we didn't know at that time how to count to 11. That's an 
embarrassment to me and to the team. I take it seriously, and our football team 
takes it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Andy Trakas made two of three field goal attempts, hitting from 28 and 
48 yards. The other one was blocked by nickel back Derrick Williams. Gary 
Taylor returned it 65 yards for a touchdown. . . . Ron Mims, defensive backs 
coach, on Williams: "He has really zeroed in and focused a lot better during 
the last three or four practices."

OIL PRICES FALL ON PEACE HOPES AND OPEC PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: WHOLESALE COSTS OF HEATING OIL AND UNLEADED GASOLINE ALSO FALL AS A 
SHOOTING WAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF SEEMS LESS LIKELY. 
</P>

<P>
An OPEC accord to boost oil production and suspicions that a negotiated 
settlement may resolve the Persian Gulf crisis sent crude oil prices sharply 
down Wednesday to the lowest levels of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices for home heating oil and unleaded gasoline also fell. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned, however, that prices could swiftly rebound if hopes for peace 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, for October 
delivery fell $1.96 to close at $25.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, 19% lower than the highest closing price last week. Last week's high 
-- the Aug. 23 close of $32.05 -- was the highest price in five years. November 
crude finished at $25.82 on Wednesday, down $1.58 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's selloff was the second sharp price drop of the week. On Monday, the 
price of crude for October delivery fell about $4 a barrel on perceptions that 
tensions in the Middle East were being reduced. The price rebounded Tuesday by 
97 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for futures contracts -- deals for future delivery -- had jumped 
dramatically after Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2. The international 
boycott of crude from Iraq and Kuwait has kept about 4 million barrels a day 
off world markets. 
</P>
<P>
To cover shortages created by the crisis, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries agreed to let cartel members boost output to prevent the 
kind of oil price jumps that might endanger the global economy. The agreement 
frees big producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which have the capacity 
to substantially boost production. Saudi Arabia is expected to increase its 
output by about 2 million barrels a day and Venezuela by 350,000 to 500,000 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other 13 OPEC members -- Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates, for 
example -- also are expected to raise production. As a result, an additional 3 
million to 3.5 million barrels will be produced daily, oil analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is calmer now that OPEC is making more crude available," said 
Randall Rothenberg, a broker at Dean Witter International Energy Futures in New 
York. "Unless there are hostilities in the Gulf, another sharp upturn (in 
prices) is unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
The drop in oil prices was impelled in part by a New York newspaper report that 
Iraq has made a secret offer to the United States to withdraw from Kuwait in 
exchange for certain concessions, analysts said. Newsday on Wednesday reported 
that Iraq last week offered to withdraw and free Western hostages in exchange 
for guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf, control of the Rumailah oil field 
that juts into Kuwait and removal of U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, traders were calmed by Iraq's announcement of plans for releasing 
foreign women and children held in Kuwait and Iraq, market observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception in the public and in the oil community that the chances 
of a shooting war are diminishing," said Thomas Burns, a San Francisco-based 
economist at Chevron Corp. "There is a glimmer of hope that there will be a 
resolution to the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said some oil companies, fearing armed conflict between Iraq and a 
multinational contingent based in Saudi Arabia, began to import more crude 
earlier this month. The increase in imports was to build up inventories in case 
an outbreak of war damages oil fields or cuts off access, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported that the stock of crude 
in the U.S. rose 942,000 barrels, to 376.6 million, for the week ended Aug. 24. 
The buildup surprised and reassured traders, prompting more selling of oil 
futures, said Thomas Bentz, director of trading at the New York-based United 
Energy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the wholesale price of unleaded gasoline for October delivery 
fell a steep 3.81 cents to 84.72 cents a gallon. Home heating oil fell 7.88 
cents to 71.64 cents per gallon on September contracts.

Microwave Oven Settlement Proposed: Thousands of people who bought Magic Chef 
microwave ovens, thinking they were new, would collect $35 each under a 
proposed settlement of three lawsuits against the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1987, Maytag Corp.'s Anniston plant repackaged or reconditioned 
ovens that customers had returned and sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160. 
Maytag denied any liability in the settlement proposal but agreed to halt the 
practice and offer refunds to the 45,000 to 50,000 customers nationwide who 
bought the ovens. Maytag also agreed to pay up to $300,000 total to the parties 
filing the suits: the Alabama Attorney General's Office and a Birmingham law 
firm.

Moody's Downgrades CalFed Debt: Moody's Investors Service downgraded ratings on 
debt, commercial paper and deposits for CalFed and its California Federal Bank 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's, which has downgraded credit ratings on several California banks and 
thrifts recently, cited the Los Angeles thrift's "somewhat weak" capital, 
uncertainty over the health of California real estate and "deteriorating asset 
quality measures." About $875 million in long-term debt is affected. A CalFed 
spokesman said the company is disappointed, adding that the thrift believes the 
action reflects the rating agency's pessimism about California real estate.

EQUITEC, STIFLED BY TAX REFORM, FILES CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Equitec Financial Group, once a premier real estate syndication firm that has 
been hit hard by tax reform, announced Wednesday that it filed for protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland-based company, which offers investors a broad range of financial 
services, said the bankruptcy filing resulted from "difficult times in the real 
estate industry" and the need to "safeguard" its remaining assets. The firm is 
nearly half owned by a subsidiary of PacifiCorp., a utility company in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Equitec is but one of several major property syndication firms to encounter 
tough times in recent years. At its peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
Equitec syndicated the sale of office buildings in downtowns nationwide, 
including the World Trade Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Equitec has been losing money heavily in recent years and is now in default on 
several of its bond obligations. The bankruptcy filing, which allows Equitec to 
reorganize and try to pay its debts, affects the parent company and "certain" 
of its subsidiaries, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan H. Kopp, an Equitec spokeswoman, said the firm needs breathing room to 
reorganize. "We have had some lawsuits filed against us and certain other 
financial pressures that have made it difficult for us to do business and 
complete our reorganization," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In one lawsuit last year, a group of investors alleged that Equitec overcharged 
on fees on its real estate partnerships sold between 1980 and 1988. Kopp also 
noted that Equitec has rented far more office space than it needs at its 
headquarters near the Oakland airport. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a real drain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Equitec is currently trying to sell 11 of its real estate partnerships -- not 
included in the bankruptcy filing -- to Hallwood Group, a financial services 
company in New York. If it goes through, the sale is expected to earn Equitec 
as much as $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Syndication firms typically acted as general partners on commercial buildings 
sold to private investors through limited partnerships. These syndications were 
wildly popular because they allowed wealthy investors to save taxes by writing 
off large paper losses from the partnerships against their income earned 
through work and investments. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress plugged this loophole in the 1986 tax reform act, and the impact 
devastated companies like Equitec.

INDICATORS FLAT IN JULY; DIP SEEN FOR AUGUST 
</P>

The government's main guide for predicting the direction of the economy was 
unchanged in July from June, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, but 
economists predict that it will soon point downward because of the Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The index of leading indicators, a basket of measures for gauging future 
economic activity, was unchanged in July after rising a revised 0.1% in June 
and 0.6% in May. 
</P>
<P>
The July index showed a glimmer of strength in higher orders for manufactured 
goods, which analysts said could keep the economy out of recession. But the 
index did not reflect the plunge in consumer confidence, a component of the 
index, since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a New York business research group, said Monday that 
consumer optimism about the economy was at its lowest level in more than seven 
years because of concern over the Mideast crisis, which has sent energy prices 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
"We still think the economy has enough momentum to avoid a recession," said 
Daryl Delano, senior economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "But 
this index is likely to be down sharply in August." 
</P>
<P>
The index is designed to predict the economy's direction in six to nine months' 
time. Financial markets showed little response to the report because the July 
data has been overshadowed by Mideast developments. 
</P>
<P>
Delano said he has revised his forecast for total 1990 growth in gross national 
product down to 1.4% from 2% but believes that stronger overseas sales will

NEW HOME SALES FALL 5TH TIME THIS YEAR

New home sales in July declined for the fifth time in seven months, the 
government said Wednesday, and industry observers said rising mortgage rates 
linked to the Mideast crisis will compound the decline in months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be facing a few months of significant weakness because of the run-up 
in rates," said Robert Villanueva, forecasting director for the National Assn. 
of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
"At least for the remainder of the year, it's difficult to be optimistic," said 
James Nelson, president-elect of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. and chief executive 
of Eberhardt Co., a Minneapolis mortgage banking company. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 548,000 units, down from 561,000 units in June and 741,000 in July, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department offered evidence of even more sluggishness 
earlier, revising downward the sales totals in both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
It said sales edged up just 0.6% in May rather than the 2.3% reported last 
month, and 4.7% in June instead of the 8% in the earlier report. 
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of the year, sales have fallen 12.4% below the pace 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said inventories of new homes showed a 7.8-month backlog at 
the July sales pace. It had been 7.7 months in June. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a pickup in sales in July as fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage 
rates continued to slide from their 1990 peak of 10.67% in May to 9.98% by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Assn., said 
consumer confidence was waning even before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 
because of uncertainty over the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens, they tend to postpone purchases of high-priced things," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, sales of existing homes did rise in July, up 3.3% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units, according to the National Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, said sales of existing 
homes advanced because of their lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was $121,000 in July, Commerce said. That was 
down 4.7% from June but still $22,600 more than the $98,400 median price for an 
existing home in the Realtors' survey.

DOW RISES 17.58 ON LOWER RATES AND GULF NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices closed higher Wednesday, buoyed by a sharp fall in oil prices and 
interest rates after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said its 
members can increase production. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 17.58 points at 2,632.43. Advancing 
issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 972 up, 508 down and 512 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks were also buoyed by the belief that the Persian Gulf 
crisis was easing. 
</P>
<P>
"The crude oil price broke, and bonds as a consequence went crazy," said Bear 
Stearns technical analyst Jack Solomon. Bond yields plunged as inflation fears 
eased. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market rise also was a continuation of a technical rally, which 
analysts said began Friday after the Dow tumbled from 2,999 in mid-July to 
about 2,483. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still seeing the tail end of a reaction to what was a very, very steep 
decline," said Yamaichi International portfolio strategist Andrew Riley. 
</P>
<P>
But volume continued to be light as many investors stayed away. Big Board 
volume was a modest 134.2 million shares versus 127.6 million Tuesday. Analysts 
said the real test for the market will be next week after vacation season ends 
and many traders return to Wall Street. Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Utilities and airlines gained on the oil and interest rate news. The Dow 
utility index rose 2.01 to 195.61, or 1%. The Dow transportation index rose 
11.31 to 911.13, or 1.3%, led by AMR, up 1 1/4 to 46 1/4, and USAir, up 1 3/8 
to 17 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among broader indexes, over-the-counter stocks were mostly lower. The NASDAQ 
OTC composite lost 1.08 to 381.78, or 0.3%. Many high-tech stocks that had 
gained in recent sessions were hit by profit taking. 3Com tumbled 3 7/8 to 8 
3/4 after the computer-communications systems firm suggested business was 
softening. Elsewhere, Novell lost 1 to 25 1/2, Apple Computer slipped 7/8 to 37 
1/4 and Microsoft dropped 2 3/8 to 60 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
But El Segundo-based Wyle Labs rose 1 1/8 to 12 1/8 after the electronic 
components firm said it was on track to post significantly higher earnings in 
the year that will end next Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
* Electronics distributor Anthem Electronics plunged 3 3/8 to 21 1/2 after 
brokerage Smith Barney lowered its rating on the stock from buy to hold, saying 
it expects business to slow. But Marshall Industries, an Anthem competitor, 
gained 1/2 to 21 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Though oil prices fell sharply, oil shares resisted selling. Chevron added 1 
1/8 to 76 3/4, Exxon was off 1/4 to 49 7/8 and Texaco edged up 1/2 to 63 1/4. 
Arco rose 1 5/8 to 135 3/4 and Mobil added 5/8 to 63 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Drug stocks were strong as investors once again flocked to stocks of 
recession-resistant firms. Lilly rose 1 7/8 to 75 3/8; Johnson &amp; Johnson 
gained 1 1/4 to 66, and Immunex jumped 2 to 27. Likewise, investors snapped up 
food stocks. Pepsico rose 2 to 75 1/8; Hershey added 1 7/8 to 37 1/2, and 
Kellogg gained 1 1/8 to 64 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* LA Gear rose 1 1/4 to 16 1/2 as vague takeover rumors circulated again. But 
some traders said the rise was mostly short-covering. 
</P>
<P>
* Litton gained 1 to 75 3/4 on strong fourth-quarter earnings and expectations 
the firm will continue to buy back stock. 
</P>
<P>
* Duarte-based Barry's Jewelers plunged 1 1/2 to 4 1/4 after reporting a loss 
of $2.42 a share in the May 31 quarter on lower revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, fears of climbing interest rates knocked Tokyo shares down. The 
225-share Nikkei average closed down 815.97 points, or 3.2%, at 24,894.79. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks finished slightly lower in quiet trading. The Financial Times 
100-share index ended down 0.4 point at 2,125.7. In Frankfurt, West Germany, 
the DAX index closed at 1,637.66 for a rise of 19.77 points or 1.2%.

CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Jump on Inflation Hopes 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices advanced sharply on the drop in oil prices, sending yields down. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 1 7/32 point, or about $12.18 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when the bond's price drops, fell to 
8.92% from late Tuesday's 9.04%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rises in Domestic Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved mostly higher in U.S. trading after a mixed performance 
overseas as currency dealers began adjusting their holdings ahead of the long 
holiday weekend in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic currency dealers said the dollar's advance came as a byproduct of 
trading in German marks and Japanese yen, which captured most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
In New York the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, down from 143.75 on Tuesday. But 
the dollar closed higher against the German mark, at 1.560 versus 1.556. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold, Silver Futures Halt Their Plunge 
</P>
<P>
Precious metal futures halted their plunge on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
largely disregarding tumbling oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Trading volume fell from Tuesday's level due to increased margins on gold and 
silver contracts demanded by the Comex. The move makes trading more expensive 
and dampened market enthusiasm, said Don Tierney, analyst with Stanley Bell 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
After losing more than $30 in recent trading sessions, spot gold inched up 30 
cents to $385.30 an ounce. But spot silver slipped 1.4 cents to $4.83.

PEOPLE: THRIFTY MAKES SEVERAL MANAGEMENT CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thrifty Corp., which recently appointed a new president, announced a series of 
additional management changes. The key change was the promotion of Christian K. 
Bement to senior vice president for industrial relations for the holding 
company, which is the parent of seven drugstore and sporting goods chains. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Bement held the same title with the company's Thrifty Drug Stores 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
He will report to Daniel Siegel, who was named president and chief operating 
officer on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the other moves at the Thrifty Drug Stores unit, Robert LaFerriere 
was promoted from vice president for buying to senior vice president for 
buying, sales and merchandise display. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Greer, formerly vice president for regional manager operations, was 
promoted to senior vice president in charge of all store operations. He 
succeeds Ellis H. Axelrod, who quit Thrifty to pursue other interests.

SEEKING A SHARE OF AMERICA'S CUP; 
</P>
<P>
SPONSORSHIP: BUSINESSES, HOPING TO SNARE PART OF THE $1 BILLION THE REGATTA IS 
EXPECTED TO GENERATE, HAVE BEEN OFFERED SPOTS IN A COMMERCIAL DIRECTORY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Yacht Club's defense of its America's Cup title in 1992 is 
expected to generate $1 billion for the local economy. But area businessmen who 
are interested in getting their share of the windfall will have to pay to play, 
according to event organizers. 
</P>
<P>
To be listed in a directory of goods and services that will be distributed to 
racing syndicates and sponsors, local businesses will have to pay fees ranging 
from $2,400 to $250,000. A directory listing is being touted by cup organizers 
as essential to grabbing a piece of the America's Cup bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
The fees paid by businesses will be their ticket to membership in America's Cup 
Services, a marketing arm of the nonprofit corporation formed to manage the 
yearlong event for the Cup's defenders. The group has planned an extensive 
publicity campaign to promote the regatta, as well as those San Diego-area 
businesses willing to support the race with their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
To make these somewhat costly fees more palatable to businessmen, fees have 
been divided into three payments over a three years. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup Organizing Committee will use the $1.5 to $4.6 million it 
expects to earn from these fees to help offset ACOC's estimated $10-million 
operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
ACOC has budgeted an additional $10 million that it hopes to receive from the 
San Diego Unified Port District to stage the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed a private income source," said Dal Watkins, the president of 
the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, which is an ACS member. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to put on a good show . . . it has to be a little bit (from) 
everybody," added Tom Vincent, the president of the Greater San Diego 
Hotel-Motel Assn. and the general manager of the San Diego Princess Hotel, 
which is also an ACS member. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins and Vincent are both on the committee that directs the ACS. 
</P>
<P>
The central component of the organization's publicity campaign is a 
comprehensive, glossy San Diego directory that Parker Pike, ACS membership and 
hosts program director describes as "a catalyst for business." 
</P>
<P>
The directory will include maps, calendars and profiles, along with other 
information for those interested in attending, sponsoring or participating in 
the America's Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
The sole criterion for membership in ACS is paying the membership fee, and a 
committee spokesman said this week that applicants will not be screened. 
Fee-paying businesses will be listed alphabetically and by category in the ACS 
directory. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that purchase some of the more expensive memberships will be granted 
space for advertisements in the directory, the size and placement of which will 
be based on the type of membership purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have the implied endorsement of this organization," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
ACS's $2,400 membership program is set up for what it calls "host merchants," 
each of which will only be listed in the directory. ACS will also sell 100 
restaurant memberships for $10,000 and 100 charter memberships for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant members will each receive a sixth-of-a-page black and white 
advertisement for their fee. Charter members will be given space for a 
full-page, four-color ad. 
</P>
<P>
Those who purchase the 10 ACS $250,000 associate memberships will be given 
their choice of position for a two-page, full-color advertisement in the 
directory. 
</P>
<P>
ACS plans to print and distribute 500,000 directories in three editions 
beginning this November, Pike said. The third and largest edition will be 
published in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the directory, ACS members will receive promotional assistance 
from an 800-number referral center being established by the organization to 
field calls from the media, travel agents, tourists, syndicates and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting calls in daily from all over the world," Referral Service 
Director Judith Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
All ACS members, regardless of the type of membership they purchase, will be 
allowed to use the America's Cup logo for their own publicity purposes. 
</P>
<P>
ACS directors explained their program to 500 San Diego County business people 
at 10 seminars Tuesday and Wednesday. A number of those who attended the 1 
1/2-hour seminars expressed interest in joining, the directors said. 
</P>
<P>
The actual regatta will begin with the five-day First International America's 
Cup Class World Championships in San Diego next May. Defender and challenger 
selection trials will begin in January, 1992, and run through April. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty challengers from 15 countries are expected to participate in the races. 
The finals will be held in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"After we win, we'll have to do this again," Vincent said.

LONG-DISTANCE PHONE RATES SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new survey of competing long-distance telephone rates showed Tuesday that Com 
Systems offered the cheapest rates for San Diego residential customers, while 
Allnet's rates were the highest. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the California Public Interest Research Group 
(CalPIRG), found little difference in the rates charged by nine of the 10 long 
distance carriers operating in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
The "1990 Long Distance Survey" report, CalPIRG's second in five years, also 
found that escalating competition among carriers has paid off for consumers in 
lowered residential rates. 
</P>
<P>
MCI was conspicuously absent from the survey. The nation's second-largest 
carrier declined to participate, despite repeated requests for rate 
information, said survey director Jeffrey Francis. 
</P>
<P>
MCI spokesman Tom Stimmel said he had tried to comply with CalPIRG's request 
but was unable to get the appropriate information from company headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The other companies provided a sum of charges for 10-minute calls from San 
Diego to nine U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, 
Chicago and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Com Systems' total bill for 270 minutes of long distance service was $41. The 
same service provided by Allnet cost $46.21. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sprint, the third largest U.S. carrier, had the second-lowest rate total 
with $42.53. AT&amp;T, the nation's largest carrier, had the third-highest 
rates with $45.26. 
</P>
<P>
The other five, ranked in descending lowest order, were TMC with $42.85; 
Metromedia ITT with $43.50; Express Tel with $43.61; Escondido Telephone with 
$44.27; and Execuline of Sacramento with $45.36. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gap between the cheapest and the most expensive carriers was less 
than $6, Francis noted that, "over the course of a year, you're looking at a 
good $60 to $100 for the average residential customer." 
</P>
<P>
The "1990 Long Distance Survey" CalPIRG report also broke down differences 
among day, evening, night and weekend rates, and among rates to different 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that carriers often tailor discounted rates to suit wildly 
varying service needs. Consumers were urged to keep track of their personal 
patterns before choosing a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, if you find a majority of your calls are placed during daytime 
hours, Express Tel might be able to save you some money. Com Systems is an 
excellent choice if you use the evening hours for calling, or if most of your 
calls are made to the Los Angeles area," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis emphasized that the nine carriers offer different rates to business 
customers. Francis said that CalPIRG has chosen Allnet as its own carrier, 
despite its high showing in the residential survey.

PASSIONATE, STUNNING FINISH TO SUMMERFEST

SummerFest '90 artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama saved his best surprises for 
the festival's final concert Tuesday night. The Colorado String Quartet offered 
stunning performances of two rarely played pieces, Mozart's First String 
Quartet, K. 80, and Alberto Ginastera's Second String Quartet. And violinist 
Mark Peskanov made his only festival appearance in the Tchaikovsky Piano Trio 
in A Minor. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity night it was not, but passionate music making took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Peskanov and cellist Gary Hoffman let out all the stops for the Tchaikovsky, 
throwing themselves into a robust, Old World performance that ignored the 
fashionable politesse of many current chamber music performances. When 
Peskanov, for example, stretched a rubato out of one of his emotion-drenched 
melodies, the motivation came from his inner depths. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman matched Peskanov's big, rosiny sound, although that timbre was 180 
degrees removed from the pointed, supple tone he had produced the previous 
evening in two Mozart piano quartets. Yet for all this muscle, when it came to 
rapid figuration, each string player sailed through with lucid definition. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Andre-Michel Schub handled the bravura piano part with such commanding 
facility, clarity and intelligence that it seems positively churlish to 
complain that his effort nevertheless appeared deficient. But in the company of 
these two string players, more sense of abandon and a deeper touch -- even some 
old-fashioned heavy pedaling -- was required. On the other hand, perhaps 
Schub's holding back was wise -- otherwise the Sherwood Auditorium stage might 
have experienced a nuclear meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's performance by the Colorado Quartet revealed just how far this 
ensemble has grown since its local debut in 1986. The players brought buoyant 
rhythms and polish to Mozart's effervescent early opus that proved all the more 
impressive when followed by a gutsy reading of Ginastera's fiery 1958 opus. In 
both style and form, the Ginastera Second String Quartet is one of the few 
worthy heirs to Bartok's six-quartet canon. It even boasts a middle movement 
bristling with those eerie special effects Bartok chose for his "night music" 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado String Quartet demonstrated an uncommon equilibrium that allowed 
the players to pummel Ginastera's driving ostinatos without impairing their 
sonic unity or ensemble cohesion. Despite this admirable internal balance, 
first violinist Julie Rosenfeld and violist Francesca Martin should be singled 
out for their voluptuous, lyrical solo flights.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PIANIST AND SINGER MCCANN STICKS WITH 
SIGNATURE TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer-keyboard man Les McCann likes to make every set different, but one song 
slips in almost every time: "Compared to What," a duet with Eddie Harris from 
the 1969 album "Swiss Movement." 
</P>
<P>
McCann, who opened five nights at Elario's last night, may be growing weary of 
the tune, but that doesn't keep him from playing it. "I do it every night, no 
matter who I'm with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The late '60s song by Gene McDaniels has become McCann's anthem, but his sets 
at Elario's are bound to hold many surprises. McCann was an electric keyboard 
pioneer in the early 1970s -- he owned one of the first Fender Rhodes electric 
pianos -- and he continues to nurture a love of assorted exotic keyboards and 
synthesizers, which he uses to color his music. 
</P>
<P>
McCann's favorites among his more than a dozen albums as a leader don't include 
"Swiss Movement." One is the early 1970s "Layers," on which he played all of 
the instruments, with some electronic help. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the first to make an electronic album by myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another personal favorite was "Invitation to Openness," which included a 
27-minute meditation titled "The Lovers." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's album "Butterfly" was a departure for McCann. He sang lighter tunes 
to lush orchestral backgrounds at the suggestion of his producer, Richard 
Egizi. He pronounced the album an artistic success, although he probably won't 
repeat the format. He'll stay closer to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his jazz work, McCann has been moonlighting as an actor. He has 
non-speaking parts in two commercials for U.S. Sprint, the long distance 
company. "I'm just sitting backstage, waiting for the big call," he said. 
Earlier this week, he recorded music for the "Matlock" television program and 
was invited to play a cameo role. He hasn't decided whether to accept. 
</P>
<P>
McCann is a hard man to pin down. 
</P>
<P>
"I rarely play standards. I never talk about what we play either. I never 
travel with charts." McCann's quartet includes trumpeter Jeff Elliott, bassist 
Del Atkins and drummer Tony St. James. 
</P>
<P>
There are San Diego angles to the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival taking 
place Friday through Monday at the Los Angeles airport Hilton and Marriott 
hotels. Included in the Saturday and Sunday lineup is The Chicago Six, the San 
Diego group that includes clarinetist Bobby Gordon. Gordon will also appear 
daily with the Condon Gang, which will re-create the 1940s and 1950s music of 
bands led by the late guitarist Eddie Condon, who owned several popular New 
York jazz clubs that bear his name. Original Condon trumpeter Ed Polcer will 
lead the Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Festival Director and trumpeter Wally Holmes learned his jazz at San Diego High 
School under history and jazz teacher Russell Warren in the mid-1940s. Holmes 
was also a member of Dick Harvey's Men of Note, the local band which won the 
regional semi-final of Look magazine's Swing Band Contest in 1946, and went on 
to place third in a national competition at Carnegie Hall. Chicago Six leader 
and bassist Bob Finch also cut his jazz chops at San Diego High during the 
'40s. Tickets for the festival are $60 for all events, $20 for Friday only, $30 
for Saturday or Sunday, and $15 for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Mark Lessman's career is picking up steam. His self-produced "More 
or Less" album is getting more radio play; KIFM upgraded the title track from 
"light" to "medium" rotation a month ago. WNUA-FM, the contemporary lites 
out-type station in Chicago, and The Wave (KTWV-FM) in Los Angeles are also 
playing it regularly, Lessman reports. He's working with Fattburger drummer 
Kevin Koch on a demo tape of songs for an album he hopes to record later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday night, the Mark Lessman Band made its Los Angeles debut at the Bon 
Appetit in Westwood. Lessman will spend October in Chicago, where his son 
lives, and where he hopes to establish music industry contacts so that he can 
spend part of each year there. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a summer full of surprises. Singer/pianist Harry Connick and his 
rhythm section joined Lessman on stage at Humphrey's, the restaurant and jazz 
club, for a version of "Superstitious" following Connick's July 8 shows at 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. Later in July, singer Michael Franks' rhythm 
section took the club's stage for a short set of standards with Lessman. 
Lessman and his band play the B St. Cafe &amp; Bar downtown tonight through 
Saturday night, and they'll be at Humphrey's Sunday and Monday nights through 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of her career, singer Etta James has belted out salty, 
no-holds-barred blues and soul. Her first single, "Roll With Me Henry," was 
banned in several parts of the country in 1954 because of its thinly veiled 
sexual innuendos. She hasn't lost any spunk: Her new album is fittingly titled 
"Stickin' to My Guns." James opens a September tour of the West Coast with a 
7:30 show next Wednesday night at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, backed by her 
nine-piece Roots Band. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach presents its last three 
nights of jazz with guitarists Dan Papaila and Art Johnson tonight and Friday 
night and pianist Al Daniels Saturday night. "Almost always, the musicians were 
playing to an empty room. We didn't expect to make money from the music, but we 
could only subsidize if for so long," said Linda Jenkins, who owns the 
restaurant with her husband Clyde. The restaurant opened in June of last year, 
and Denver-based jazz singer Ellyn Rucker inaugurated jazz in the tiny bar the 
following month. She returned for several weeks this summer. Jenkins said 
Rucker may return next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Jimmy Corsaro teams up with longtime musical partner, singer Sharon 
Andrews, for this afternoon's "Jazz After Work" concert on the steps of the San 
Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park from 4:30 to 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, flutist Holly Hofmann plays 
her last local date before leaving Saturday for an East Coast tour. She'll play 
clubs and festivals in Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 
Locals Bob Magnusson and Mike Wofford and Los Angeles drummer Sherman Ferguson 
will join her for the Jazz Charlotte festival in Charlotte, NC. Tomorrow night, 
she'll work with pianist Randy Porter, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Tim 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Joe Pass is the main attraction on this Saturday night's "Club Date" 
program on KPBS-TV at 11:30, airing again Monday night at 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist and songwriter Richard Glick plays jazz, ragtime and blues Friday 
night at 8 at Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. Owner Dorothy Griska 
has the store up for sale. It's losing money. Asking price: $77,000.

At last weekend's chili cook-off held at the Treehouse Fun Ranch 
Clothing-Optional Family Resort in Devore, Jim Beatty's "Sespe Creek Chili" 
topped the field of 50 but the special award for Best Chili Cooked in the Nude 
went to Jim Zack's "Buckeye Chili." In the beauty contest division, Steve 
Gearry and Lisa Adkins were chosen Mr. Chili Sauce and Ms. Chili Pepper.

Non-fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be uninterested to learn that 
the rock band of that name, based on the cartoon, movie, etc. about a gang of 
turtles whose diet is limited to a single food group, will begin a 40-city 
concert tour Sept. 6. The tour is sponsored, needless to say, by Pizza Hut. 
</P>

In a possibly related story, McDonald's is trying out its own line of pizza in 
the Midwest. Early reports say topping choices include Bacon Double 
Cheeseburger.

The Pastry Shot From Guns 
</P>
<P>
In Azerbaijan, which is in the unenviable position of being half in Iran and 
half in the Soviet Union, they have a lot of rice. How much rice? So much that 
they've figured out a way of making rice baklava: They dribble rice batter on a 
hot pan and use the doily-like sheets in place of filo. The resulting pastry 
tastes like a cross between baklava and Rice Crispies. 
</P>

There's No Egg or Cream In It -- Say, Let's Call It an Egg Cream! 
</P>
<P>
The egg cream -- a mixture of milk, seltzer water and chocolate syrup -- is 100 
years old this year, says Louis Auster, who claims the New York soda fountain 
treat was invented by his grandfather, Stanley Auster.

Vegiforms Inc. of Cincinnati makes plastic molds you can place around a 
vegetable blossom so that as your zucchini matures it will have a pattern 
impressed into it: say, an elf, or Mr. Have a Nice Day. There's one that will 
make a yellow squash look like an ear of corn. 
</P>
<P>
That's if you only want to pay $10.95. For $2,500, the company will make a mold 
with any pattern you want; Elvis, Clark Gable and Pat Sajak have already been 
ordered. Owner Richard Tweddell prefers using eggplants for women's faces 
because of the smooth complexion. "Linda Evans and Vivian Leigh," he reports, 
"had a sheen to them, like a hood ornament."

<P>
The Microwave of the Future 
</P>
<P>
Single-microwave homes will be a thing of the past by the year 2000, a speaker 
recently told a microwave industry conference in Chicago. There will be mikes 
in all rooms of the house, he predicted; people will cook in their bedrooms, 
microwaving canned coffee for breakfast ("Early morning routines will not be 
disrupted by trips to the kitchen"). There will also be microwave ovens in 
trains, buses and private cars (no need to stop at a fast food stand, just load 
up with items at the gas station/convenience store). 
</P>
<P>
One problem: Interest in microwaves may already be peaking. Microwave sales 
went up 12.3% between '85 and '86 but only 2.3% between '88 and '89.

Galliano is engaged in a titanic promotional effort for a new drink called 
simply Galliano and Tonic (one part Galliano, three parts tonic, wedge of 
lime). It has held a talent search to find six good-looking young Italians to 
drive around the country in yellow Ferraris so they can visit happening, 
upscale night spots and hand out yellow roses and talk to people about Galliano 
and Tonic. Maybe now everybody will forget about the Galliano-based Harvey 
Wallbanger. CHARLES PERRY

COOK IT LIGHT: ANOTHER COOL IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This dish is ideal for summer entertaining because it's cold, it can be made a 
day ahead of time, and it looks terrific. To make an even prettier presentation 
I like to garnish the platter with edible flowers, such as nasturtiums, 
whenever they are available. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the chicken is removed from the heat just slightly undercooked is 
because it will continue to cook as it cools in the liquid. If overcooked, 
chicken becomes tough and less flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
PARTY CHICKEN PLATTER 
</P>
<P>
6 whole chicken breasts, boned, skinned and halved 
</P>
<P>
1 cup coarsely chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
1 cup coarsely chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1 carrot, peeled and sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch fresh parsley (including stems and leaves), chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Dash white pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 cups dry white wine, about 
</P>
<P>
1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup calorie-reduced mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup finely minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
Cucumber slices, carrot curls, pimiento strips, radish roses, optional 
</P>
<P>
Remove all visible fat from chicken. Place chicken in large saucepan and add 
celery, onion, carrot and 1 bunch chopped parsley. Mix salt and pepper with 
wine and pour over chicken mixture. If mixture is not completely covered, add 
little more wine. Bring to slow boil over medium heat. Cover and simmer until 
chicken breasts are slightly underdone, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and 
allow to cool to room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Remove chicken from pan, reserving liquid, and arrange on large platter. Cover 
tightly and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
Return reserved poaching liquid to heat and bring to boil. Strain and reserve 1 
3/4 cups. Soften gelatin in water. Add to reserved liquid and mix until gelatin 
is thoroughly dissolved. Add bay leaf and allow mixture to come to room 
temperature. Chill until slightly jelled, about 1 hour. Then remove and discard 
bay leaf. Add mayonnaise to gelatin mixture, mixing thoroughly with wire whisk. 
</P>
<P>
Remove chicken from refrigerator and spoon gelatin mixture over each breast, 
covering entire platter. Sprinkle 1/2 cup minced parsley evenly over all. Cover 
and refrigerator until mixture is firmly jelled, about 3 hours. Garnish with 
cucumber slices, carrot curls, pimiento strips and radish roses. Makes 12 
servings.

THE PERFECT BURGER: PLAIN AND SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't care if you eat blueberries on your calamari or strawberries in your 
pasta. But please don't tell me about eating a hamburger with avocado, 
sauerkraut, bacon, chili, Jack cheese or any of these weird, improper 
ingredients. For I am a hamburger purist. 
</P>
<P>
My hamburger credentials come from the home of the one and only authentic 
hamburger, which was developed in Glendale, in August of 1936. The originator 
of the perfect hamburger is Bob Wian, the man who turned one little rickety 
hamburger stand into a chain of 1,136 Bob's Big Boy restaurants across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The Perfect Burger 
</P>
<P>
In order to make this hamburger you must have the following ingredients. You 
cannot allow yourself any creative license: 
</P>
<P>
1. One sturdy, fresh, tender bun (it must have structure to stay intact). 
</P>
<P>
2. Lots of mayonnaise (a dry hamburger is not acceptable). 
</P>
<P>
3. If onion is desired, it must be chopped and stirred into the mayonnaise so 
it doesn't slide around and become unevenly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
4. Freshly ground beef. The meat must have enough fat to make a juicy patty, 
and the patties must be salted well before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
5. Clean, crisp, fresh iceberg lettuce, shaved so it is evenly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
6. Liberal spread of relish (Bob made his own red relish). 
</P>
<P>
7. If you must have cheese on this hamburger, only mild Cheddar, please. 
</P>
<P>
I guarantee that if you make this hamburger once you will never again fall back 
into making or eating those "gourmet" beef sandwiches called hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect burger, of course, is accompanied by the perfect fries. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect French Fries 
</P>
<P>
1. The perfect French fry must be about 3/8 inch square and no more than four 
inches long. Those unpeeled fat fries are fake, and so are those effete 
thread-like shoestrings. 
</P>
<P>
2. Fresh oil or fat is a must. Recycled fat is not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
3. The outside of the French fry must be crisp, golden or light brown, and the 
inside must be tender and taste like potato. 
</P>
<P>
4. French fries must be hot. 
</P>
<P>
5. French fries must be liberally salted; don't waste mega-calories eating 
unsalted fries. 
</P>
<P>
The Perfect Milk Shake or Malt 
</P>
<P>
A milk shake is made with ice cream, flavored syrup and milk. Soda fountains 
around America began to sell shakes during the last part of the 1880s. In the 
beginning liquor was often added (even today, many bar drinks are nothing more 
than milk shakes with liquor). After the turn of the century, milk shakes 
became wholesome and spirit free. Here's how to make one: 
</P>
<P>
1. Use first-rate ice cream that is smooth, creamy, and fresh. Old ice cream 
often forms ice particles, and this will ruin a milk shake. 
</P>
<P>
2. Flavoring syrup cannot be fake or weak. Be generous in use. 
</P>
<P>
3. Keep it cold. It is important to bring together all the necessary components 
to create deep clear flavor; rich, thick, fluffy and smooth texture; and very 
cold temperature. 
</P>
<P>
4. In order to make a decent milk shake at home you cannot use a blender or a 
food processor. They will immediately thin the drink and ruin it. The thick 
air-filled mixture that only a fountain milk shake mixer can quickly achieve 
can be duplicated, as Hershey's 1934 cookbook directs, by making a milk shake 
in a jar and shaking it vigorously. This does work -- but it is quite 
strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
6. Technically a malt is a milk shake with one to three tablespoons of malt 
added. But my definition is that a milk shake is thick but can be drunk through 
a straw, whereas a malt cannot be drunk through a straw for the first 10 
minutes. Then the ice cream melts a bit and the air dissipates from the 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Horlick's Malted Milk may be obtained in a 13 ounce jar for $7.50 from the 
Vermont Country Store, P.O. Box 3000, Manchester, CTR., Vt. 05255-3000, (802)

CORN REIGNS AS KING OF MIDWEST; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVALS: EVERY YEAR, THOUSANDS FLOCK TO THE NATIONAL SWEET CORN FESTIVAL IN 
HOOPESTON, ILLINOIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Along with baseball games and swimming holes, sweet corn is synonymous with 
summer in the Midwest. As tasseling stalks stretch straight and tall, we 
anxiously check for drying silks. Then, with mouthwatering smiles, we greet 
golden platters of corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>

Hands down, the Heartland grows more sweet corn than any other region. 
Wisconsin and Minnesota lead the way in production (more than 1.1 million tons 
annually combined). But Illinois ranks No. 1 in corn festivals. Every year, 
thousands flock to the town of Hoopeston, 100 miles south of Chicago, to feast 
on buttery ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot corn! Hot corn!" echoes the cry as crowds push toward mounds of 
sunshine-colored ears slathered in butter. Ready with every kind of container 
-- from cardboard boxes and backpacks to oven roasters and picnic coolers -- 
thousands of munchers gather for the National Sweet Corn Festival in this 
farming and canning community. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's celebration, corn-crazy throngs devoured or carried home 42 
1/2 tons of lip-smacking ears, cooked to perfection with the help of an 
old-fashioned steam engine. As one butter-drenched bystander punned, "It's 
complete cornage." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve thousand acres of sweet corn surround Hoopeston (population 6,400). 
That's enough to keep two shifts at the Stokely USA corn-canning plant humming 
all summer. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching end of the sweet-corn season signals the start of Hoopeston's 
festival (Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 this year). Launched in 1938, the festival 
attracted an estimated 60,000 last year. ("A conservative guess," insists Dave 
Barker, last year's festival chairman.) 
</P>
<P>
Free corn-on-the-cob highlights the last three days of the celebration. 
Naturally, there's a big corn-eating competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The winner in the adult division usually chomps more than five ears in the 
alloted three minutes," says contest organizer John Sales Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But free corn isn't the only festival attraction. McFerren Park teems with 
carnival rides, kids' games, concerts, demolition derbies, a national beauty 
pageant, a classic-car exhibit, a flea market, a fishing derby, and a talent 
and art show. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is formidable. Over at the horseshoe pits, for example, 
contestants come from 100 miles away every year. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors at the top rung of the six-class ladder throw ringers 65% to 75% of 
the time. (Pitch a ringer with at least one of every five throws and you can 
qualify for the lowest level of competition.) 
</P>
<P>
Hoopeston Jaycees, who organize the event, donate all proceeds to local 
charities. Everyone in town contributes something. 
</P>
<P>
The festival hits its stride on Saturday, when a big parade winds through town 
to McFerren Park. Parade enthusiasts line the curbs. As the procession sweeps 
past the town's two canneries and a can-making plant, Stokely employees and 
others unfortunate enough to have to work their regular jobs during the busy 
sweet-corn harvest season lean from open windows to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The crowning glory of the festival is the National Sweetheart Pageant, spawned 
by a local Miss Sweet Corn competition. Four past National Sweethearts have 
been named Miss America, proving that Hoopeston judges know how to pick more 
than sweet corn. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Miss America hopefuls from states as far away as Alaska and Maine 
entered the competition last year. 
</P>
<P>
During all the goings-on, the ears keep bubbling. How do you cook 42 1/2 tons 
of sweet corn? "First," says Steve Eyrich, who works for a Hoopeston firm that 
manufactures canning equipment, "you get an old-fashioned steam engine and 
replumb it." 
</P>
<P>
The massive iron monster, belching black coal smoke amid rising clouds of 
shimmering steam, circulates boiling water through a series of shiny cattle 
troughs. Jaycee volunteers dunk basketfuls of fresh sweet corn -- which an 
antique shucking machine husks -- into the steamy bath. After that, the 
volunteers dump the corn into huge pans and hand-butter the ears using giant 
brushes. 
</P>
<P>
Corn-loving throngs that gather watch each step, as if the ears were crisp $20 
bills. Finally comes the shout everyone is waiting to hear: "Hot corn! Hot 
corn!" And after that, it's everyone for himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 When summer gets steamy, team up these two abundant Midwest vegetables in a 
cool salad.

MALTED MILK: ITS COOL HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERAGES: WILLIAM HORLICK THOUGHT HE WAS INVENTING HEALTH FOOD. HAH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who speaks for the malt? The malted milkshake occupies a safe but basically 
humble position in the soda fountain repertory. Probably nobody downing a malt 
-- whether the classic '30s and '40s foamy variety or the post-'50s semi-frozen 
sort -- suspects its colorful and downright heroic history. Disease! 
Starvation! Prohibitionism! The South Pole! 
</P>
<P>
Technically speaking, malt is a mixture of sugars produced from starch. The 
thing that converts the starch is an enzyme with the silly-sounding name 
gibberellin, which is secreted by grain as it sprouts. Eventually the enzyme 
action is stopped by roasting the malt, which also caramelizes some of the 
sugars and produces attractive toasted flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly malt is fermented and turned into beer or whiskey. However, malt sugars 
are easy to digest, and 19th Century doctors often prescribed malt for children 
and invalids. There were problems with it, though. In liquid form it tended to 
ferment, and for years every attempt to produce a stable dried form of malt 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
The man who succeeded in making malt powder was William Horlick, an Englishman 
who emigrated to Chicago in the 1870s. His process consisted of drying malt 
extract with wheat extract in a vacuum. He called the resulting product 
Horlick's Food, patented it and set up a business in Racine, Wis. (where he 
also married a woman who must have been a cousin -- her maiden name was 
Arabella Horlick). 
</P>
<P>
Doctors blessed his name and prescribed their patients Horlick's Food, which 
made a tasty drink when mixed with milk. However, in the late 19th Century, 
cow's milk was often unwholesome. Before modern refrigeration and 
pasteurization (which did not become universal until the '40s), milk was 
commonly infected with diseases, such as the dreaded tuberculosis. The 19th 
Century expression "the summer sickness" referred to diseases spread by milk. 
</P>
<P>
Horlick was unhappy about this, so he conceived the idea of making a form of 
Horlick's Food that wouldn't have to be mixed with milk. In 1882 he perfected 
the process of drying milk right along with the wheat and malt, making a 
product that only needed to be mixed with water. 
</P>
<P>
It was a convenience food as well as a health food. Travelers carried it to the 
tropics, the Himalayas and the Poles. Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets were 
renowned as a cheap, reliable food during the Depression, when they were a 
standard item in school and work lunch pails. Even as late as the '50s, members 
of the Depression generation often made sure to keep malted milk tablets in the 
pantry for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
All of these attractions would have made Horlick's business a success, but as 
it happened, there was another factor at that particular time as well. In the 
late 19th Century, the Temperance Movement was constantly trying to wean men 
away from saloons. One bright idea along these lines was the milk bar, also 
known as the ice cream parlor or soda fountain, where only ice cream and 
nonalcoholic beverages were served. 
</P>
<P>
Malted milk was a natural for the soda fountain. It was not only nonalcoholic 
but regarded as healthful. American taste turned a health food into a pleasure 
food, as it would later do with peanut butter and granola. 
</P>
<P>
With tens of thousands of ice cream parlors making him a wealthy man, Horlick 
became a public benefactor. He donated a school, a hospital and a park to the 
city of Racine. He supported wholesome youth movements like the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
And probably out of a sense of gratitude to the Scandinavians of Wisconsin, he 
donated to many Norwegian causes. When King Haakon of Norway made him the first 
American to receive the Order of St. Olaf, it was because Horlick had been one 
of the principal backers of Roald Amundsen's expedition to find the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at a map of Antarctica today, you will find proof. About 125 miles 
from the Pole -- a little closer than the Wisconsin Range -- you will find the 
Horlick Mountains. The man to whom ice cream had been so good is memorialized 
in the continent of ice.

WINE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1987 McDowell Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($8) -- As the wine market becomes more 
competitive -- due, in part, to a greater supply of wine than the marketplace 
can absorb -- wineries must either lower prices or increase discounts. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell Valley, which used to make an expensive Cabernet from its own grapes, 
decided to drop the price of the wine. By blending in some purchased grapes, it 
could afford to. The result is a wine of quality nearly equal to the 
estate-bottled version, but with a lower price. The aroma is delicately herbal 
and the balance excellent.

THE BUTCHER: HAVE A GENUINE OLD-FASHIONED BEEFSTEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a great book, and knowing your affection for days gone by and sawdust on 
the floor, I had to copy 'All You Can Hold . . . ' for you. Hope you enjoy this 
feast as much as I did. Sincerely, Stan A." 
</P>
<P>
It's a quote from a note from a friend; a man who knows my likes -- as far as 
food is concerned -- better than any man. He also knows my shortcomings with 
spelling and punctuation better than anyone: Stan has edited this column for 
nearly 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"All You Can Hold For Five Bucks" is one chapter from a book by Joseph Mitchell 
titled "McSorley's Wonderful Saloon." It describes a great gastronomic orgy 
that my clan (butchers) used to indulge in on Saturday nights in New York back 
around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"The New York steak dinner, or 'beefsteak' is (was) a form of gluttony as 
stylized and regional as the river-bank fish fry, the hot rock clambake, or the 
Texas barbecue." It is believed to have started in the late 1800s, when 
butchers from slaughterhouses on the East River would hustle choice cuts of 
beef sirloin from the aging room at the plant into the kitchen of one of the 
local saloons, grill the steaks over charcoal, and feast on them during their 
Saturday night sprees -- washing down the beef with pints leading to quarts 
that led to gallons of beer. 
</P>
<P>
A beefsteak was a macho affair first put on by butchers, cooks and Teamsters 
for butchers, cooks and Teamsters. But, by the turn of the century, beefsteaks 
were being run by all manner of groups; religious, political and social. 
Beefsteaks were never given or held, they were thrown or run. 
</P>
<P>
"They were amazing functions," to quote Mitchell. "The men wore butcher aprons 
and chef hats. They used the skirt of the apron to wipe grease off their faces. 
Napkins were not allowed. The name of the organization that was running the 
beefsteak would be printed across the bib, and the men took the aprons home for 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days they didn't even use tables and chairs. They sat on beer 
crates and ate off the tops of beer barrels. You'd be surprised how much fun 
that was. Somehow it made old men feel young again. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always sawdust on the floor. The men ate with their fingers. They 
never served potatoes in those days. Too filling. They take up room that 
rightfully belongs to meat and beer." 
</P>
<P>
The traditional menu at a beefsteak consisted of thin slices of ripened sirloin 
served on day-old bread or toast, grilled lamb chops, sometimes grilled 
kidneys, lamb or pork wrapped in bacon, and beer, lots of beer. Often the 
trimmings from the beef were ground and small hamburgers were served as 
appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
There were two schools of beefsteak devotees in New York, and as is the case 
with most things in "The Big Apple," they were divided geographically. You had 
your East Side School and your West Side School. On the East Side, the steak 
slices were served on day-old bread: "Day-old bread is essential. You can taste 
the steak." The beefsteak chefs on the West Side preferred to serve the beef on 
slices of toast. I think I subscribe to the West Side School. 
</P>
<P>
The West Side School centered for years around the Old Hoboken Turtle Club, 
founded in 1796 with Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr as charter members. 
That's not why I subscribe, however -- I'm not much into politics. No, the 
reason I subscribe to the West Side School is that, according to this book, 
from 1879 until well into the mid 1900s, the official chef of West Side 
beefsteaks was Bob Ellis. That man has got to know what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Of the East Side School, Ellis says, "What they call a beefsteak ain't no 
beefsteak, it's just a mess." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of those hit-or-miss beefsteak chefs," he said. "I grill my steaks 
on hickory embers. The efflorescence of seasoned hardwood is in the steak when 
you eat it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I use toast. None of this day-old bread stuff for me. My beefsteaks are 
genuine old-fashioned. I'm getting close to 90 years old, and I ought to know 
what's old-fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder how long that Ellis might have lived if he hadn't had 
all that fun, drunk all that beer, and held -- no, I'm sorry -- thrown all 
those beefsteaks. 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead -- have a beefsteak -- a genuine old-fashioned beefsteak. You might 
live to be 90, but there's no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
This is my version of Ellis'. If you like, serve fresh mixed green salad at a 
beefsteak. Politicians used to do that on both sides of town back in the '20s 
after the 19th Amendment was passed. 
</P>
<P>
GENUINE OLD-FASHIONED BEEFSTEAK 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 top sirloin steak, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches thick 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
12 to 16 slices French bread, toasted 
</P>
<P>
Mix together salt and pepper and sprinkle liberally on both sides of steak. 
(Salt creates crust that holds juices in.) 
</P>
<P>
Grill over coals or broil to desired degree of doneness (130 degrees for medium 
rare). Place on cutting board that has trencher to catch juices and let stand 5 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in saucepan, then add Worcestershire. Slice steak into very thin 
slices on diagonal. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange toast slices on 1 or more large platters. Put 1 or 2 slices beef steak 
on each slice of toast. Stir meat drippings from carving into pan with butter 
and Worcestershire, then pour 1 to 2 tablespoons butter sauce over each toast 
slice with meat. Serve with mugs of beer. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

SLAYINGS TAX POLICE TO THE LIMIT; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF KILLINGS HAS BOOSTED THE AREA'S DEATH TOLL TO 
A RECORD 10 IN AUGUST, AND LEFT DETECTIVES STRAPPED. 
</P>

<P>
An explosion of gang violence in northeast Los Angeles during August has 
boosted the area's death total to 10 for the month, a record, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented number of violent deaths has so taxed the Northeast 
Division's six-detective homicide squad that Detective Ron Whitt, who heads the 
unit, turned over the investigation of the most recent killing to detectives in 
the Police Department's downtown Robbery Homicide Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very strapped," Lt. Rob Watters said. The August slaying count -- 
higher than any previous month in the division's history -- brought the total 
for the year to 32 as of Aug. 28. Last year at this time, 24 people had been 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
The rash of violence has left the detectives spread so thin that they have had 
to put some investigations on hold to look into more recent killings. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects have been arrested in three of the month's slayings, and police have 
solid leads in two others, Whitt said. All five of those cases were 
gang-related, police said. A sixth case, a murder-suicide, is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related killings are up 150% from this time last year, Watters said, from 
6 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
Four of this month's slayings involved confrontations between rival gang 
members, police said. Another involved a 15-year-old gang member accused of 
stabbing a woman to death in her residence, Whitt said. Two others involved 
non-gang members who were attacked by men who might have been gang members, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
In July there were two killings in the northeast area, and both were 
gang-related, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, two people were stabbed to death in separate incidents, police 
said. Two juveniles have been charged in Saturday's stabbing of a 48-year-old 
Eagle Rock woman in her house, Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, a 15-year-old youth allegedly entered Doneice Taylor's house 
through an unlocked side door, took a butcher knife from the kitchen and 
stabbed her several times, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the youth called his 12-year-old friend into the house and the two took 
Taylor's car keys from her purse and drove away in her car, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers on patrol saw the car, a gray Nissan 280Z, without its lights 
on, Whitt said. He said the car ran a stop sign at Avenue 45 and Ellenwood 
Drive at about 1:30 a.m. and police chased it about three miles eastbound on 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Nissan broke down near Figueroa Street. The officers arrested the youths 
for evading police, checked the car's registration and sent other officers to 
the owner's house to see if the car had been stolen, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived at Taylor's house in the 4000 block of West Avenue 43 to find 
her dead on the couch, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths, who told police they were gang members, were charged with 
first-degree murder, grand theft of an auto, conspiracy to commit grand theft 
of an auto and conspiracy to commit robbery, Farrell said. Because police say 
conspiracy was involved in the killing, both youths were held responsible, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths confessed to killing Taylor and stealing her car, Whitt said. They 
are being held in Eastlake Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In the other stabbing death, police found the body of a Latino man in his early 
30s lying face down in dirt and brush between Sycamore Park and the Pasadena 
Freeway, said Detective William Gailey of the Police Department's Robbery 
Homicide Division. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not identified the body, which was found by a passerby about 1 p.m. 
Monday, Gailey said. The victim, who had been stabbed several times in the 
upper torso, was about 5 feet, 5 inches tall, weighed about 135 pounds, had a 
mustache and was missing an upper front tooth, Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt bearing the name of the 
Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects in the case, which Whitt turned over to Gailey because 
Whitt's homicide team was busy with other investigations, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Watters said that if the murder rate does not go down, the unit will ask the 
division's head of detectives to add another two-person team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to need another team," Watters said. "If this keeps up, we 
obviously cannot do it." 
</P>
<P>
The division has three detectives assigned to the Community Resources Against 
Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit, which deals with gangs, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Court appearances also take detectives' time away from murder investigations, 
he said. Homicide and CRASH detectives frequently are tied up with murder cases 
going through the courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You spend weeks in court on a murder because it's so involved," Whitt said. He 
said that most of the Police Department's bureaus were short-staffed, so the 
chances of getting more homicide detectives for the Northeast Division -- 
usually one of the city's less violent police bureaus -- are slim. 
</P>
<P>
But because this month's level of violence is not typical for the Northeast 
Division, Whitt said he is optimistic that things will return to normal soon.

HANDICAPPED ARE VICTIMS OF COST-CUTTING; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CUTS IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES TO THE POOR ARE RESPONSE TO A SHORTFALL IN 
STATE FUNDING.

Carolyn L. Harcar and her mother were shocked when they arrived at Rancho Los 
Amigos Medical Center last week to find that budget cuts had shut down a job 
program for the severely handicapped the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Harcar, 47, of Lakewood, suffers from a degenerative condition that has 
weakened her legs and made her dependent on her mother, a walker or a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
She had begun attending the vocational program two days earlier with the hope 
that it would eventually lead to a job at a nursery school. Now that the county 
program is closed, the Harcars said they do not know where they will be able to 
find comparable, affordable services. 
</P>
<P>
"(Carolyn) was disappointed. She cried," said Caroline Harcar, 76, who fears 
that her daughter could one day end up in a board-and-care home. "She has to 
learn to be on her own. I know I'm not going to be around forever." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, five Los Angeles County hospitals began making 9.5% cuts in 
outpatient services to the poor. The cuts were ordered earlier this month by 
the Board of Supervisors in response to a shortfall in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts will eliminate about 11,000 outpatient visits a month at Rancho Los 
Amigos, County-USC, Harbor-UCLA, Martin Luther King-Drew and Olive View 
hospitals. County Health Director Robert Gates said about 100 employees will be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks gutted Rancho's vocational rehabilitation program. As a result, 
409 people will not receive outpatient services, a reduction of 614 monthly 
visits. Twenty-one employees, ranging from counselors to typists, have been 
reassigned temporarily and are expected to be laid off next month, spokeswoman 
Susan Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions at Rancho will save the county $389,184 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Susumu Yokoyama, associate executive director at Rancho, said the hospital had 
few options. Other outpatient services are needed to maintain patients' 
physical health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it does have an impact, it won't have the serious medical impact if, 
for example, we had cut the diabetic clinic," Yokoyama said. 
</P>
<P>
The doors of Rancho's Vocational Rehabilitation Center were closed the 
afternoon of Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Among the services eliminated was the hospital's vocational evaluation 
workshop, which tests severely disabled people to determine what types of jobs 
they can perform. 
</P>
<P>
Also eliminated was counseling to train, motivate and help handicapped 
outpatients find jobs. Such counseling will still be available for inpatients 
at Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's community resources section was cut as well. It provided a 
directory of community services, such as bus routes and information on what 
restaurants have ramps for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital work program for handicapped outpatients also was eliminated. The 
program employed outpatients as clerical workers, among other things, to help 
prepare them for outside jobs. 
</P>
<P>
To some patients, the cutbacks mean longer trips to other hospitals or 
rehabilitation centers where some of the same services are provided. To others, 
who may not be able to afford private rehabilitation services, the cutbacks may 
mean doing without. Of the 409 patients affected, 95 are indigent, Yokoyama 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And even for those who can afford them, some of the rehabilitation services cut 
at Rancho will be hard to duplicate, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho is known for its treatment of head injuries, and many of the outpatients 
who used the vocational services at Rancho were victims of such injuries. Some 
of those outpatients were receiving extra help managing problems such as 
short-term memory loss before they could qualify for State Department of 
Rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was (a) unique (program) for people who weren't quite ready for us," said 
Maureen McIntyre, a state rehabilitation supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin E. Burns, 40, is one of those people who needs extra help. He doesn't 
remember the 1982 auto accident that damaged his brain and changed his life 
forever. He was driving his Volkswagen from his Norwalk home to his teaching 
job at Whittier Christian High School when he collided with a truck, his wife, 
Lynnette, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Burns emerged from a coma two months later. But when he started to talk, the 
former history and math teacher spouted algebraic equations. He had to learn 
how to walk and run and to relearn words such as refrigerator. Burns' 
short-term memory will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Burns has helped his wife clean houses to supplement the 
family income. He knows he has to vacuum, mop and shake out rugs. But without a 
reminder, he tends to forget the order in which the tasks should be done. 
</P>
<P>
Burns underwent vocational testing at Rancho and was receiving outpatient 
counseling to help him get a job best suited to his abilities. For the Burnses, 
the cutbacks at Rancho and the loss of counseling could be significant. They 
said they do not know where to receive similar services. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he's not going back to teaching," said Lynnette Burns, a reading 
tutor. "It's important we know what his capabilities are. You can go out and 
get a job at McDonald's, but what if you can do better than that?"

</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Douglass has lived here off and on all of her life. Michael Horrigan 
raised his family here. So when developers set out to put a high-rise 
condominium building in their neighborhood of quaint old houses, they 
circulated petitions, passed out flyers and called their neighbors to the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Their actions did not seem unusual in a town of about 50 neighborhoods, many of 
them fighting to preserve their integrity. 
</P>
<P>
But the response from two Huntington Beach development companies that want to 
build the high-rise in the Zaferia neighborhood -- east and west of Redondo 
Avenue, off Pacific Coast Highway and south of the traffic circle -- is said to 
be unprecedented here: They have sued Douglass, 40, who is on a fixed income, 
and Horrigan -- a 54-year-old grandfather of four -- for more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last month in Long Beach Superior Court, alleges that Douglass 
and Horrigan engaged in a conspiracy to defame the G.M. Peters Development Co. 
and H&amp;P Development, which want to build the 63-condo complex with 13,000 
square feet of commercial space at 2600 Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
A Long Beach attorney defending Douglass and Horrigan said his clients were 
"SLAPPed" -- hit with what has come to be known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against 
Public Participation, a recent corporate invention to "shut grass-roots critics 
up." 
</P>
<P>
"These people are being sued for the crimes of speaking up at City Council and 
Planning Commission meetings and talking to their neighbors," attorney Marc 
Allen Coleman said. "This lawsuit is an attempt to stop residents from voicing 
their concerns in violation of their First Amendment rights. It is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stephen R. Kilstofte, who represents the developers, declined to 
discuss the lawsuit without the permission of his clients. The developers could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But in the lawsuit, the developers allege that the residents made "false and 
fraudulent" statements, such as the question posed in a homemade flyer full of 
misspellings and typos that asks: "Do you want 5 to 7 story condo's next to 
single-family residents and over crodinbg (sic) of our neighborhoods?" 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the flyer "misrepresents the actual size" of the 
project, which is four stories. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a petition signed by 20 Zaferia neighbors says the proposed condominium 
would make street parking "totally intolerable"; that lights from the structure 
would be "like living in a parking lot," and that the development would surely 
lead to an increase of "vice and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments prompted the City Council to freeze permits for the structure, 
which had been approved by city planners April 5, and send the project back to 
the Planning Commission for study. A new hearing is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The developers contend that the delay is costing them money and that the 
residents are guilty of "intentional interference with prospective economic 
advantage." They are seeking $1 million in compensatory damages, plus 
unspecified punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they win the lawsuit, Horrigan and Douglass said, the court battle 
alone could wipe them out. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, a former postal clerk, said she is disabled with severe allergies and 
lives on a fixed income. Horrigan is a construction manager whose proudest 
financial achievement is that he has almost paid off his Molino Avenue home. 
Both are new to the theater of community activism, having given their Zaferia 
Neighborhood Assn. a name just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman has reduced his fee and delayed billing. Still, neither resident can 
afford so much as the $2,500 retainer fee required to begin the legal defense, 
they said. 
</P>

"When I first saw the lawsuit I was mad as hell," Horrigan said. "But then I 
was a little scared. People start running around saying a million this, a 
million that. At my age, I am not in a position to lose my house." 
</P>
<P>
They plan to go to neighborhood groups throughout Long Beach to ask for 
financial help, contending that a successful SLAPP could chill the rights of 
anyone who signs a petition or speaks out at a Planning Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"An injury to one is an injury to all," attorney Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
So common have SLAPP suits become elsewhere that legislation aiming to curb 
them recently won state Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
They are typically filed by developers and others who stand to suffer financial 
losses when citizens protest their projects. The mere filing of such a suit can 
hush a vocal resident. 
</P>
<P>
Horrigan, for example, said he has spoken out just once since the suit was 
filed. Upon advice of their attorney, he and Douglass have resolved to keep 
fighting, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just ordinary neighbors trying to improve our neighborhood," Douglass 
said. "I don't think we've done anything wrong."

MUSICIAN LIMIT PROVES A BITTER BREW; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: A BURGEONING COFFEEHOUSE SCENE IS FEELING THE SQUEEZE OF A LONG 
BEACH ORDINANCE REQUIRING A SPECIAL PERMIT IF MORE THAN ONE MUSICIAN PERFORMS 
AT A TIME.

<TEXT>
<P>
Things were percolating despite some empty seats on a recent Monday night at 
Midnite Expresso. 
</P>
<P>
Music and caffeine lovers, many of them sporting goatees and red bandannas, 
milled about the sidewalk in front of the tiny Belmont Shore coffeehouse, while 
inside a lone guitar player on a stool belted out such original songs as "Joth 
Is Still Looking for Pia Zadora." 
</P>
<P>
But the musician, C. Lee Clarke, was dissatisfied. "I'd like to have a harp 
player," said Clarke, 32, a traveling minstrel who said he lives in his car and 
plays wherever he can. A backup harpist would have enhanced his performance, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago that would have been no problem, according to owner Mike 
Obering. For years, Midnite Expresso had featured groups of local musicians in 
addition to espresso, cappuccino, cheesecake, sandwiches and chess. Musicians 
performed in duos, trios or more. 
</P>
<P>
Then earlier this summer, Obering said, a police officer appeared one night and 
cited the establishment for violating a city ordinance that requires a special 
permit for live entertainment by more than one musician at a time. So Obering 
reluctantly told his musicians that they could perform only solo. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, he has become involved in an issue that will probably 
keep cropping up with the emergence of new European-style coffeehouses in Long 
Beach and elsewhere. In the last four years, musicians say, at least five such 
cafes have opened in the city, two in Belmont Shore, one downtown and several 
in other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike larger bars and discos that serve liquor and feature popular musical 
combos, coffeehouses offer an intimate, non-alcoholic environment in which 
conversation can flourish, patrons say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they say, the establishments provide performance venues for 
less-experienced musicians whose styles are sometimes experimental and often 
non-commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Midnite Expresso regular Phil Jacoubowsky said the cafe serves as "a meeting 
point. People (come here) to talk philosophy, arts and music." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a small coffeehouse trying to provide an atmosphere," Obering said. 
"We shouldn't be treated like the big (bars) making lots of money." 
</P>
<P>
But Jaunice Floyd, the city's business license supervisor, disagreed. She said 
it is her duty to enforce the law equally. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat them all the same," Floyd said of her office's requirements regarding 
entertainment licenses. Midnite Expresso "is doing the same thing as a larger 
place." 
</P>
<P>
To get a license, all businesses -- regardless of size -- must go through the 
same long, costly process, in which the outcome is uncertain. After applying to 
the city, Floyd said, an owner must pay flat fees for inspection and approval 
by various departments and finally submit to a hearing before the City Council, 
at which any neighbor or resident may object to the issuance of an 
entertainment license. 
</P>
<P>
The process is necessary, Floyd said, to allow affected parties to comment on 
proposed activities likely to affect the quality of life in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
While in most cases entertainment license hearings are held before an 
establishment opens as part of the general licensing process, she said, city 
inspectors -- and on occasion, police officers -- make random stops at 
businesses to determine whether establishments are complying. 
</P>
<P>
"Actual citations are rare," Floyd said. "We generally give them lots of 
warning." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Floyd nor a spokesman for the Long Beach Police Department could 
confirm that a citation had been issued against Midnite Expresso, but Obering 
said a police officer had issued a citation. 
</P>
<P>
Moins Rastgar, co-owner of System M coffeehouse in the city's downtown 
redevelopment area, said he applied for an entertainment license last year 
after city officials told him that he was violating the law by allowing musical 
groups to perform. 
</P>
<P>
For four months, Rastgar said, the group performances -- for which his place 
was well known -- had to cease while city agencies conducted inspections 
related to his application for an entertainment license. 
</P>
<P>
Rastgar said that the inspections and other application costs totaled $2,000; 
that business dropped 40%, costing him another $30,000, and that after the 
license was issued, Rastgar spent an extra $5,000 in advertising to woo his 
customers back. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see how much of an impact it can have," he said. "In a small business, 
it could be enough to force someone to close down or sell." 
</P>
<P>
Midnite Expresso, which seats 30, has had a drop of about 20% in business since 
the combos disappeared, Obering said. But others said there is an even more 
dramatic impact on local musicians, many of whom depend on modest 
establishments such as Obering's to showcase their talents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad," said Michael Rothmeyer, 20, a guitarist who has played at 
many coffeehouses, including Midnite Expresso. "A lot of people who come to 
listen just don't want to go to a bar. Solo is fine, but to have more (players) 
offers broader possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Without venues such as coffeehouses that are accessible to less-established 
groups, the musicians said, many will never get the experience or exposure 
necessary to hone their skills and move on to larger audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe," said Gregg Young, a Belmont Shore-based musician whose group, the 
2nd Street Band, has played all over town, "that the arts are the heart of a 
city, and if you have something that's restricting that heart's growth, then 
it's not doing the city justice. If you don't have a spot to see (younger 
unestablished musicians), how will you know that they're there?" 
</P>
<P>
Obering said his coffeehouse had been allowing musical groups to perform for at 
least four years, without interference from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when he bought the establishment from its previous owners, no 
one told Obering that he would need a license to continue the live 
entertainment that had already become a tradition there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the former president of a local residents' group said he had received 
complaints about the coffeehouse and had mentioned them in a letter to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Huber, who until recently was president of the Belmont Shore Improvement 
Assn., said: "I can tell you that (the place) doesn't fit into the category of 
one of the necessarily good members of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that complying with city codes is part of the game of being in 
business," said Huber, adding that while he has no objection to coffeehouses 
per se, he generally does not favor establishments or activities in Belmont 
Shore that add to what he perceives as the congested conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city is finally starting to enforce its codes," he said, "I say 
'Hallelujah!' " 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Doug Drummond, whose district includes Belmont Shore, said he 
is unaware of controversy involving Midnite Expresso but added: "If we permit 
one (business) to operate without licensing, then we are opening the doors to 
others, and the laws have to be equally applied." 
</P>
<P>
Obering said he is applying for an entertainment license and is considering the 
possibility of expanding his facility. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is also forming a committee that will try to persuade the City 
Council to change the licensing law to ease the financial burden on smaller 
establishments that apply for a license.

CLEANUP OF TAINTED SOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Builders Emporium has begun removing contaminated soil from its warehouse site 
on Surveyor Street after a Pomona Fire Department inspection found that used 
motor oil and solvents had been dumped on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn LaRochelle, division chief and fire marshal, said Builders Emporium shut 
down its vehicle maintenance garage and hired a hazardous waste cleanup company 
after the Fire Department discovered the problem last week. 
</P>
<P>
John Kearney, executive vice president, said employees in the garage failed to 
follow proper procedures for the disposal of used oil. He said that the company 
immediately closed the garage but that operations in the adjoining warehouse, 
which has 140 employees, were not disrupted.

HILLSIDE CONSERVANCY PANEL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council appointed a nine-member steering committee to create a private 
Hillside Conservancy, which will be dedicated to preserving the natural state 
of the foothills above Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote Tuesday, Councilman Marshall Mouw said the council's appointment 
of a steering committee is the last city involvement with the organization. All 
support for the conservancy will be from private sources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish its mission, he said, the conservancy could purchase land it 
wants to preserve, receive donations of land, or persuade landowners to place 
deed restrictions on their properties that would restrict development.

<P>
The San Rafael Bridge, which crosses a flood control channel on Laguna Road 
between San Rafael Avenue and Arroyo Boulevard, is closed until January for a 
$1.3-million reconstruction program. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old bridge, one of about 100 reinforced single-span concrete arch 
bridges in the state, will be restored to "its original appearance and 
load-bearing capacity," said Cynthia Kurtz, project manager for the Pasadena 
Public Works and Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rails and balusters will be replaced, defective concrete will be repaired and 
the surface will be repaved, Kurtz said. A new mortar coating will be applied 
to much of the structure. The area around the bridge, largely obscured by 
vegetation, will be landscaped. The La Loma Bridge a mile north may be used as 
an alternate route.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: HE LET THE TAPESTRY OF FACES AT HIS SIDE STATE THE 
CONCLUSION FOR HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a three-piece brown wool twill with faint blue pin stripes, Mario Pasten 
stood out easily at a Monday evening gathering as the best-dressed member of 
his alumni group. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained the illusion by hiking the trousers of the hand-me-down suit low 
on the hip so the cuff would reach the instep. He intends to have them altered, 
but even "as is" they served well to illustrate how a little help can change a 
person's course in life. 
</P>
<P>
Pasten was among more than a dozen alumni of Glendale's federal job placement 
programs who assembled Monday for an upbeat ceremony in which business leaders 
paid tribute to the area's diverse work force. 
</P>
<P>
The event, in the sixth-floor auditorium of the North Brand Boulevard 
headquarters of CIGNA Healthplans of California, was part of the National Assn. 
of Counties' celebration of JTPA Alumni Week. 
</P>
<P>
That refers to the federal Job Training and Placement Act, the Reagan-era 
successor of the maligned CETA program of the 1970s. In conservative Glendale, 
JTPA -- created by legislation co-authored by U. S. Sens. Edward Kennedy and 
Dan Quayle -- is a much more popular program. Just how much so was evident as 
the Verdugo Private Industry Council (PIC), which oversees the job placement 
programs in Glendale, Burbank and La Canada Flintridge, honored its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
The event started as a typically contrived affair, with finger foods, 
introduction of politicians, reading of proclamations and testimonials by 
businessmen offering the well-worn theme that, whatever the task, Glendale does 
it better. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we see here in Glendale that we are proud of is the 
cooperation between the private sector, the government sector and the school 
district," said businessman Bill Jacot, the crisp, sandy-haired master of 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
But then Jacot abruptly changed tempo, asking the JTPA alumni in the crowded 
room to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
Close to 20 rose from their seats, most of them showing the same clean look of 
business aplomb as those the civic leaders who remained seated. 
</P>
<P>
They squeezed into the tiny space in the front of the room and stood resolutely 
as Jacot told their life stories. 
</P>
<P>
He began with the striking man in the brown suit whose youthful appearance was 
accentuated by a long tail of black hair hanging over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to call out Mario Pasten," he said. "Mario was homeless and had 
limited English skills. . . . He was sent by the Verdugo PIC's service 
provider, Alliance for Education. That same day, he went on an interview. The 
next day, he was hired at 1928 Jewelry as a delivery driver, making $7 an hour 
plus medical benefits. Mario overcame homelessness and is now planning more 
training on his own, in the evenings, so he can advance in his work." 
</P>
<P>
There was a shudder of disbelief and then applause when Jacot added: "Mario is 
raising his two teen-age sons, who are here today." 
</P>
<P>
Jacot next introduced Alex Drake, a dapperly dressed young black man. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex was recovering from chemical dependency and living in a sober environment 
called the Victory House," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the Alliance for Education, Alex obtained on-the-job-training in 1988 
and learned how to build, install and repair cabinets. After working for 
someone else and learning the business, Alex became independent and now at the 
age of 26 has his own successful small business for cabinetmaking." 
</P>
<P>
In quick succession, Jacot related the stories of Gloria Martinez, who was "on 
and off welfare for years, intermittently trying to support two children as a 
waitress"; Magdalen Berberian, who "emigrated from Iran in September of 1988" 
speaking virtually no English, and sometimes-cook Grover Newsome, who was 
"tired of living on unemployment insurance and wanted a new career with a 
chance for advancement." 
</P>
<P>
Each received training through JTPA's vocational programs at Glendale College 
and is now employed in a steady job with satisfactory pay and the chance for 
promotion, Jacot said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of those who stood before the audience, in fact, work for CIGNA, whose 
management Jacot praised for its "generosity and wisdom to invest in JTPA's 
participants and our alumni." 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Jacot did not dwell on the obvious -- that Glendale's new central 
business district has become the home of a multifaceted, multilingual work 
force with complex training needs. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Pasten's sons, Mario Jr. and Jesus, translated for their father, who 
had trouble understanding the dozens of solicitous questions thrown at him. 
</P>
<P>
They said they'll be going to Eagle Rock High School in the fall, in the 
community they hope to live in as soon as their father saves enough money to 
move up from the van that serves as their home.

BAN ON SECURITY BARS FOR DOWNTOWN STORES UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week upheld a 33-year-old ban on sliding security bars on 
downtown storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to continue enforcing a zoning law that has forbidden 
the bars since the city was incorporated in 1957. The issue was placed on the 
council agenda after some residents complained about the bars. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Egan, assistant to the Bellflower city manager, said business owners are 
not allowed to use the wrought-iron bars on their windows because they 
discourage business and hinder firefighters who may have to break in during an 
emergency.

PLAN FOR CITIZEN NEGOTIATOR ON DISNEY PROJECT KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A move to put a citizen representative on the team of Long Beach negotiators 
appointed to hammer out plans for a Walt Disney theme park has been dashed amid 
concerns over who would be named and how, community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a citizen representative seems to be almost as controversial as the 
plan itself. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Grabinski said such a representative might gum up the 
negotiations. If one group is represented on the negotiating team, he 
suggested, other groups will demand the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want a committee of 300 at negotiations?" Grabinski asked. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Kuehne, president of the 2nd District Neighborhood Assn., had asked 
the Long Beach City Council to hire a resident to be a "full member" of the 
negotiating team, which is currently made up of officials from City Hall and 
the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehne proposed that the citizen be chosen by the Coalition of Neighbor 
Organizations, an umbrella group of 85 business and community leaders that 
serves as an information network. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehne's request was pulled from Tuesday night's council agenda, however, after 
it was decided that she was not the appropriate person to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Some community leaders say privately that it would be impossible to select one 
citizen to represent them, since most of Long Beach's 50 neighborhoods have 
conflicting needs and desires. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney organization is considering building a $2-billion theme park and 
resort in downtown Long Beach that promises to bring in thousands of jobs and 
millions of dollars in tax revenue. But the project has raised concerns about 
traffic congestion, pollution and other problems.

SHINDIG PLANNED SATURDAY TO OPEN ALL AMERICA PARK

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Paramount will celebrate the opening of a five-acre park at 13330 
Orizaba Ave. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The city has spent about $2 million designing and landscaping All America Park 
on land donated by the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The park has a baseball diamond, a soccer field, a wading pool and a stream 
with waterfalls that meanders around a play island. 
</P>
<P>
City-sponsored festivities will begin at the park at 6 p.m. and feature a 
Dixieland band, fireworks, games and free hot dogs, hamburgers, soft drinks, 
popcorn and cotton candy.

DRUG SEIZURE FUNDS TO BUY USED VEHICLES FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved spending $126,400 confiscated from drug dealers 
to buy nine used vehicles for the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ron George said the vehicles will be used by gang-control 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate has a total of $1.8 million in a fund from the seizure of drug 
dealers' assets. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the council hired William F. Cornett Jr. to serve as a 
consultant and as interim city administrator through Nov. 26 while the city 
looks for a permanent chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Cornett, of Riverside, will receive $8,273 a month. The former city 
administrator, Bruce Spragg, was fired last week.

RULES FOR EXPLICIT MATERIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by appeals from a 14-year-old boy, the City Council gave preliminary 
approval Tuesday to an ordinance that restricts stores from openly displaying 
sexually explicit books, magazines and videos. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Wiser, an eighth-grader at Foothill Christian School in Glendora, said he 
approached city officials in February because he was concerned that 
pornographic magazines were being sold to minors. 
</P>
<P>
If given final approval Sept. 11, the ordinance will require racks that 
partially hide erotic material from view. City Atty. Ken Brown said 
pornographic videos will have to be in an area restricted with an "adults only" 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
California law prohibits sale of erotic material to those under 18.

ORDINANCE BANS SALES FROM NON-MOTORIZED PUSHCARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council passed an ordinance Monday making it illegal to sell anything 
from non-motorized pushcarts. 
</P>
<P>
Council members cited health and safety concerns, saying there has been an 
increase this summer in street vendors selling items such as hot corn on the 
cob and shaved ices from pushcarts, bicycles and shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, pushcart vendors may sell on designated streets only 
during city-sponsored parades and must meet stringent requirements to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Offenders will be issued a citation for a court hearing and their carts and 
goods may be impounded. The city's 47 licensed motorized truck vendors are 
exempt from the ordinance.

NO. 2 CITY OFFICIAL LOSES BID FOR TOP CINCINNATI POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey recently lost a bid for the city 
manager's job in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
A recruiter there said Shirey, the second-highest Long Beach city official, was 
one of two finalists interviewed for the Cincinnati post earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of interviews, Gerald Newfarmer, former city manager of San 
Jose, was selected. 
</P>
<P>
"Close, but no cigar," said Shirey, 41. 
</P>
<P>
Shirey said the job appealed to him because "it gave me the opportunity to run 
a city rather than having the No. 2 job." He has been assistant city manager in 
Long Beach for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiter Norman Roberts said that he had tried to lure Shirey away from Long 
Beach several times before the Cincinnati opening but that Shirey was not 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an excellent job in Long Beach," Shirey said. "I'm not looking for 
another job. But I'll keep my eyes open."

MEMORIAL SERVICE TODAY FOR ALHAMBRA FIRE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service will be held today for Fire Chief Robert G. Tolladay Jr., a 
28-year veteran of the department who was credited with making a number of 
improvements in emergency training and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Tolladay died on Friday, his 51st birthday, in a plane crash near Placerville. 
</P>
<P>
Tolladay and three companions were on their way to a weekend rafting trip on 
the American River when their Cessna 210 Centurion went down in a forest 
canyon. All four were found Saturday morning and pronounced dead at the scene. 
The cause of the crash was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very saddened and shocked," said Alhambra Battalion Chief Jerome 
Pennington, who was a schoolmate of Tolladay's at Woodrow Wilson High School in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ingram, an administrative battalion chief, will serve as acting chief 
until a permanent replacement is found. City Manager Kevin Murphy, who was on 
vacation this week, will handle arrangements for finding a new chief, Ingram 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a personal loss to all of us," Ingram said. "I always considered 
(Tolladay) my friend. He had this open attitude about him. Always up about 
everything, always smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram credited Tolladay with putting firefighters through a 120-hour Emergency 
Medical Training program, years before such training became mandatory under 
state law. When he was appointed chief in 1978, Tolladay saw to it that all 
equipment in the city's fire stations was standardized, Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Tolladay's daughter, Cindy Schafte, said her father was an avid outdoorsman 
when he wasn't attending to his 70-member department. "He was always sailing, 
flying or skiing," said Schafte, of Vancouver, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Tolladay, a licensed pilot, was at the controls of the airplane when it 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The other victims were identified as Diane Lorraine Prather, 40, of Norwalk; 
Suzanne Joyce Campbell, 43, of San Gabriel, and Arnold Jerold Grothe, 52, of 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his daughter Schafte, Tolladay is survived by another daughter, 
Debbie, of Portland, Ore.; a son, Jeff, of Bartlesville, Okla.; his parents, 
Robert G. Tolladay Sr. and Cora Tolladay of Earp, Calif.; a sister, Katherine 
Richards of Temple City; and three grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
The service will begin at 1 p.m. at Rose Hills Mortuary, Memorial Chapel, 3900 
S. Workman Mill Road, Whittier. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be sent 
to the Alhambra Firefighters Assn.

FED UP WITH RECYCLING MACHINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, I am just about ready to throw in the towel -- on recycling glass and 
paper, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Have you tried using the recycling centers, bins, booths, machines placed in 
front of supermarkets (i.e., Lucky stores or Vons)? Good luck! I've tried, once 
by stopping at Lucky on Central in Glendale at 7 a.m. The machines don't 
function before late morning weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
Then I tried Lucky on Hillhurst: machines in non-accepting mode. By then, I was 
tired of hearing my glass jars banging and breaking in the car trunk. I drove 
down Hillhurst to Vons at the corner of Sunset and Hillhurst, where the 
machines were likewise non-functioning. 
</P>
<P>
By then, irritation had reached its apex. I left my trash bags filled with 
glass containers right in front of the recycling machines. I hope someone found 
a way to recycle my refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Now I sometimes drive glass jars to a private recycler for the measly refund of 
4 cents a pound. Is it worth the trouble, the mess of extra trash bins crowding 
the minuscule kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
Paper recycling is a joke. Paper products are "accepted" as donations but 
without incentives to the concerned citizen. How about phone books? Delivery 
persons do not take past editions in trade of the latest books. What a 
monstrous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there is more, but for now, those selective or non-functional recycling 
centers/machines have turned my enthusiasm into a sneer.

THEATER REVIEW: 'DADDY'S DYIN' '; 
</P>
<P>
AN EVENING OF IDLE FARE; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A STEREOTYPICAL PLOT WITH STEREOTYPICAL CHARACTERS, BUT THE CAST MAKES THE 
DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new production at the Plaza Players Theater is "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's 
Got the Will?" Subtitled "a comedy of heirs," for those who couldn't figure 
that out from the title, the play is a welcome change of pace from the troupe's 
recent spate of heavily charged dramatic productions. 
</P>
<P>
In spirit and delivery, Del Shores' play is a TV sitcom in live performance. 
There's little about it that won't seem at least vaguely similar to those 
familiar with series including "Mama's Family," "The Beverly Hillbillies," 
"Designing Women" and "Golden Girls," or the Plaza Players' (or anybody else's, 
for that matter) recent production of "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the show's basic plot, summed up concisely in the title, all one 
needs to know is the play takes place in Texas, in the more or less present. 
From that, you need no help in extrapolating the cast of characters (Daddy and 
the extended family) and their individual traits: nobody's particularly bright, 
son Orville is overweight, at least one character dresses tastelessly and 
there's some singing. 
</P>
<P>
Stereotypical and trite though many elements of Shores' play might be, the 
Plaza Players' production is stronger and more consistent than most of the 
other shows being staged around Ventura County. Put your mind in "idle" for a 
couple of hours and you'll likely have a fine time -- even if you are too 
embarrassed to tell the folks at work where you were the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Credit can be spread among director John Michael Duggan and the cast. The eight 
players are an ensemble in the best sense: They look, feel and sound as if they 
belong together, with no overwhelming star turns and nobody pulling less than 
his or her load. (The worst sense of the word ensemble is when it is used to 
describe film or TV casts where nobody in the audience has heard of any of the 
participants). 
</P>
<P>
They play the stereotypical characters better perhaps than the roles deserve: 
The accents are passable Texan when warranted, everybody looks right (Alan 
Price is splendid as oily brother Orville) and the gaudy wardrobe worn by 
aspiring singer Evalita (played by Barbara James) is a wonder. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a credit to the acting and direction that a couple of the characters 
show real heart: Buford (Daddy) Turnover (Irv Citron), victim of a progressive 
stroke, rises above caricature, as do hippie musician Harmony Rhodes (David 
Wagar) and Orville's put-upon wife, Marlene (Cindy Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
Also turning in fine performances are Mary Super and Denise Leahy as practical 
Sara Lee and pious Lurlene, and Jean Nussman, whose feisty Mama draws strongly 
from Estelle Getty in "Golden Girls" but is also reminiscent of Vicki Lawrence 
in "Mama's Family," Irene Ryan's Granny in "The Beverly Hillbillies" and Al 
Capp's comic strip character Mammy Yokum -- not to mention Ma Kettle and a 
whole passel of fictional rural matriarch, right down to Miss Ellie Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?" plays Wednesday, 
Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m. through September. Admission is $6 on 
Wednesday, $7.50 on Friday and $8.50 on Saturday. The Plaza Players Theater is 
in the Old Town Livery courtyard, 34 N. Palm St. in downtown Ventura. For 
further information or reservations, call (805) 643-9460 or (805) 653-2378.

SHOW GOES ON DESPITE THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thefts have left major holes in a Westside hologram exhibit, but a companion 
show in Pasadena is still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
"Images in Time &amp; Space," including more than 70 rare holograms from around 
the world, are on display through December at Pasadena's McKinley Library. 
</P>
<P>
A carnival will be held at the Pasadena exhibit this weekend to raise money to 
replace 25 holograms stolen earlier this month from the Santa Monica show. The 
Pasadena exhibit was unaffected by the thefts, event organizer Utz Baldwin 
said, but the cost of replacing the stolen art is estimated at between $70,000 
and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Canadian Associates of Science and Technology and billed as 
the most significant collection of international holograms ever, "Images in 
Time &amp; Space" includes pieces from the United States, Europe and the Soviet 
Union, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Holograms are laser-generated images that appear to be three-dimensional but 
are actually flat. They are used in art, business and science, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Images in Time &amp; Space" is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 
Pasadena's McKinley Library, 377 S. Oak Knoll Ave. Admission is $3.50 for 
adults, $3 for senior citizens and students, and $2.50 for children.

AUSTIN PARK MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT IN A UNIQUE WAY AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Austin Park made it official six years after moving with his family from Seoul, 
South Korea, to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, on the day he officially became a U.S. citizen, Park changed his 
first name from Tang-Chi to Austin, the moniker he had adopted when he enrolled 
at Glendale High in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that 'Six Million Dollar Man'? Steve Austin? We had that (television) 
program back in Korea," Park said. "I watched that show and was really into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Physically, Park bears little resemblance to his super-hero namesake, who was 
portrayed by Lee Majors. 
</P>
<P>
But there are those -- including USC football Coach Larry Smith -- who believe 
Park has something akin to a bionic will. 
</P>
<P>
How else to explain why Park -- all of 5-foot-8 and 155 pounds -- daily 
subjects himself to the physical punishment that comes with being a walk-on 
player on the USC football team? 
</P>
<P>
Park, 24, is a senior kicker and wide receiver in his second season with the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me proud to be a member of the USC football team," Park said after 
practice last week. "It's not real easy. I've seen a lot of guys who come out 
and quit right away." 
</P>
<P>
Park, who played two seasons each at Glendale High and Glendale College, is 
third on the depth chart at kicker and is a fifth-unit receiver. He has never 
played a down in a Trojan game and will not be on the sidelines when USC opens 
its season Friday night against Syracuse in the Kickoff Classic at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Park has, however, been a mainstay for USC on the scout offensive team -- a 
group that runs the plays of upcoming opponents against USC's starting 
defensive unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Austin is not a guy that's going to be all-conference," said Smith, who has 
led the Trojans to three consecutive Pacific 10 Conference championships. "He's 
not a guy that's going to start or be a backup. He's a guy that, if we get 
ahead in a game and it merits it, we're going to put him in there just because 
he's earned it. 
</P>
<P>
"He does figure strongly, though, when we blow the horn during practice and 
have to get our two scout teams together. He's going to run every play so he's 
a valuable asset and a person that's contributing as much as someone playing in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Park has run up against one of the quickest and most dominant defenses 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, you have to be prepared for the hitting or you're going to get 
hurt," Park said. "Those big guys, the outside linebackers and strong safeties, 
are kind of tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week I caught a pass in practice and somebody knocked the hell out of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
But Park said he knew what he was getting into when he decided to enlist with 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
His first exposure to football was via television in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a channel for the U.S. Army and I'd turn it on on weekends and watch 
football," Park recalled. "It looked good with the pads and helmets but I 
didn't know anything about the rules." 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Glendale with his family, Park said he began to get a feel 
for the game by playing catch with friends. He decided to go out for the team 
at Glendale High -- not only to play the game but to be in an situation 
allowing him to practice his English. 
</P>
<P>
Between his junior and senior years in high school, Park attended a kicking 
camp run by former UCLA kicker John Lee, who is also Korean. 
</P>
<P>
"(Lee) helped me a lot," Park said. "He had become a great kicker, so I figured 
I could, too." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school, Park took a year off from school to help his 
father's grocery business in Fullerton. In 1986 and 1987, he was a backup 
kicker for Glendale College, making two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Park took another year off to complete his associate of arts degree before 
enrolling at USC in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my high school friends were surprised that I went out for football at 
USC," Park said. "They thought, if you're Oriental and you played in high 
school, that was it. They couldn't even grasp the concept. 
</P>
<P>
"For most Orientals, even if you're a great player in high school, you just go 
to college and study." 
</P>
<P>
As he begins his final season, Park is realistic about his chances of actually 
playing in a game for the Trojans. He knows it will take a combination of 
circumstances for him to be on the field at the Coliseum for a snap. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came to USC, kicking the winning field goal in the Rose Bowl was my 
ultimate goal," Park said. "Now my goal is to play in a game, to be on the 
field for a kickoff, as a receiver, anything."

CREAM OF THE CROP: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S TOP 22 FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Lascola, who operates the Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation 
Assn., said the prep football talent pool in Southern California last season 
was disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"But we strung together five good years in a row," he said. "So I guess we were 
due for a bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Lascola and other scouts who annually canvas the Southland in search of top 
college prospects said the talent level is up this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a pretty good year," says Houston-based super scout Max 
Emfinger. "There (are) some really good people out there this year." 
</P>
<P>
Lascola said the talent crop is especially deep at defensive back, offensive 
tackle and running back. It is noticeably thin at quarterback, wide receiver 
and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top-rated players this season are running back Napoleon Kaufman of 
Lompoc and offensive tackle Robert Loya of Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lascola and Emfinger, national recruiting services such as G 
&amp; W Recruiting Report of Pennsylvania, Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report 
of Illinois, SuperPrep magazine of Costa Mesa and the Florida-based Steve 
Smith's Blue Chip report also determine which Greater Los Angeles and Orange 
County seniors are rated among the best players in preseason reports. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana, El Toro and Van Nuys Montclair Prep each have two players on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in no particular order, are the Terrific 22: 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson (El Toro, quarterback) -- It may be a down year for quarterbacks in 
the Southland, but Johnson could be the exception. If the name sounds familiar, 
his brother Bret was starting quarterback at UCLA last season. At 6-foot-4 and 
210 pounds, he is bigger than his brother and has a powerful throwing arm. An 
all-around athlete, Johnson was All-Southern Section in football, baseball and 
basketball as a junior. Playing sparingly at quarterback last season, he 
completed 20 of 25 passes for 550 yards and should have little difficulty 
making the transition from wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon Kaufman (Lompoc, running back) -- He was the highest-ranked player on 
the Terrific 22. One of the swiftest players in the nation, the 5-9, 170-pound 
Kaufman has speed and moves that one scouting service compared to Notre Dame's 
Raghib Ismail. He won the 100 and 200 meters at the state track meet in June 
and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds. As a junior, he gained 2,954 
all-purpose yards and scored 39 touchdowns and averaged a remarkable 70 yards 
on kickoff returns. He also played defensive back and had four interceptions 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont Warren (Dorsey, running back) -- If Kaufman is the best running back in 
the state, Warren is not far behind. Some scouts rate him higher than Kaufman. 
At 6-1 and 185, he has more size and speed with a 4.4 time in the 40. He also 
finished second in the state in the 400 meters in June. A slashing runner, he 
rushed for 1,350 yards and 25 touchdowns and caught 20 passes for 205 yards. 
"It is rare when you find a back with all the tools Lamont possesses," said the 
Lemming report. He also is an excellent defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks (Van Nuys Montclair Prep, running back) -- As a junior, Sparks had 
to share rushing yardage with teammate Michael Jones. With Jones now at USC, 
the 6-1 and 208-pound Sparks might be in position to produce some impressive 
rushing figures this season. Not that his totals of 1,944 yards and 32 
touchdowns in 210 carries last year and more than 3,300 yards in two seasons 
are not impressive. Scouts describe him as a power back with great moves, 
vision and more-than-adequate 4.5 speed in the 40. He bench presses 320 pounds 
and also plays linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Ontiwaun Carter (Granada Hills Kennedy, running back) -- In an exceptional year 
for running backs, Carter joins Sparks as another prized player from the San 
Fernando Valley. At 5-10 and 175, he does not have outstanding size but makes 
up for that with speed, strength and durability. He runs the 40 in 4.5 and has 
bench pressed 350 pounds. Carter has rushed for 2,753 yards and 21 touchdowns 
in his first two seasons at Kennedy, including 1,563 yards and 11 touchdowns 
last year. Recruiters also think he could to play cornerback in college. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Neal (Paramount, running back) -- Small is big this year in the Southland. 
Neal, 5-9 and 170 pounds, is another undersized running back who is receiving a 
look from recruiters. Last season he rushed for 1,729 yards and 23 touchdowns 
and averaged more than 12 yards a carry. Also a good pass receiver, he combines 
exceptional quickness with leaping ability and lateral movement. A good 
all-around athlete and outstanding student, his best moves in college could 
come at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Jones (Westchester, wide receiver) -- One of the best all-around 
athletes on the Terrific 22, Jones is usually mentioned first as a receiver and 
then as a defensive back, but could easily wind up playing either position in 
college because of his size and speed. A transfer from St. Monica, he is 6-3 
and 190 pounds and runs the 40 in 4.5. As a junior, he caught 32 passes for 606 
yards and 10 touchdowns and demonstrated his explosive qualities by returning 
four punts and two interceptions for scores. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Rosborough (Long Beach Jordan, wide receiver) -- An athlete who might be 
able to pick his sport for college, the 6-3 and 175-pound Rosborough is equally 
adept in football and basketball. Depending on what scout you believe, he can 
also play at either wide receiver or defensive back. As a receiver with 4.5 
speed, he combines good leaping ability and hands and is considered a big-play 
threat. On defense, he has the instincts to excel at safety. He also averaged 
15 points for the basketball team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Finch (Riverside Ramona, offensive lineman) -- As talented as the list of 
running backs appears to be, the pool of interior linemen is even deeper. One 
of the most talented is Finch, 6-6 and 265 pounds, who has excelled on both 
sides of the line for a Ramona squad that has produced several big linemen. G 
&amp; W Recruiting Report rates him the No. 1 offensive line prospect in the 
state. He is a fierce blocker with superb technique and more-than-adequate foot 
speed. The biggest question is his grades, which could stand improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Loya (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- For sheer power and determination, 
you will not find a more dominating lineman than the 6-3 and 280 Loya. Said 
Lemming's report, "Robert is a fierce competitor who is known for knocking 
defenders on their backside." Regarded by many scouts as the state's best 
offensive lineman, he has quick feet with a 5.0 clocking in the 40. He has a 
dead lift of 565 pounds. He is also solid academically with a 3.6 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Clay Hattabaugh (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- With major-college prospects 
such as Loya and Hattabaugh on the same line, it is no wonder why big things 
are expected from Fontana again this season. At 6-3 and 265, Hattabaugh is 
slightly smaller than Loya but a little faster with a 4.9 time in the 40. He 
also has tremendous strength, having bench pressed 375 pounds. He moves well 
off a block and is especially strong as a run-blocker. A tackle in high school, 
he could move to guard for college. 
</P>
<P>
John DiSante (Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, offensive lineman) -- In a blue-chip 
year for offensive linemen in the state, DiSante rates among the best. He has 
the size (6-4, 270 pounds) and above-average foot speed with a time of 5.0 in 
the 40. He is a good all-around athlete who also plays nose guard. He also 
competes in basketball and track and field. He receives high marks for his 
aggressiveness but what scouts like most about him is his intense work ethic. 
He is also a good student with a 3.5 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan Roy (Van Nuys Montclair Prep, offensive lineman) -- Roy certainly has 
the size colleges like (6-6, 280 pounds). He also has outstanding quickness 
with a 5.0 in the 40 and ample strength having lifted 470 pounds in the squat. 
Particularly strong as a run-blocker on offense, he is also an imposing force 
as a tackle on defense, having batted down six passes in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cardona (La Mirada, offensive lineman) -- Another huge tackle who can play 
offense and defense, the 6-4 and 280-pound Cardona is not the fastest lineman 
among the Terrific 22 with a 5.4 clocking in the 40, but he makes up for any 
shortcomings with his aggressiveness and solid work habits. "He can pull, trap 
and makes very few mistakes at offensive tackle," said the Lemming report. He 
also stands out on defense, having recorded eight quarterback sacks in 10 games 
in earning All-Southern Section honors last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Greeley (Riverside La Sierra, offensive lineman) -- There are four 
players from the Inland Empire on the Terrific 22 and all are sizable offensive 
linemen. Greeley fits the description with his 6-3 and 275-pound frame. He has 
excelled at tackle on offense and defense. He is one of the quickest linemen on 
the list with a 4.9 time in the 40 and can bench press 360 pounds. His brother, 
Keith, plays basketball for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hogue (El Toro, defensive lineman) -- The talent supply at El Toro never 
seems to be lacking and Hogue is another standout for one of the top programs 
in the Southland. At 6-4 and 255 pounds, he plays offense and defense. Scouts 
think his future is at defensive tackle. He has good speed with a 5.0 time in 
the 40, which probably helped him accumulate 12 quarterback sacks last season. 
Hogue also plays tackle on offense but prefers defense. He is also an 
exceptional student with a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Balian (LaVerne Damien, defensive lineman) -- Damien always seems to 
produce at least one major-college prospect on the line and Balian is the 
latest. A 6-4 and 250-pound nose guard, Balian has the quickness and strength 
that enable him to control the line of scrimmage. He has a best of 4.9 seconds 
in the 40 and can bench press 420 pounds. Mostly a defensive player, he has 
even played a fullback on offense. He is also an outstanding wrestler, which 
might help to account for his excellent lateral mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Gilmour (Temple City, defensive lineman) -- He is not the biggest lineman 
in the state and that is one reason why Gilmour might eventually play outside 
linebacker in college. Scouts like his potential. At 6-5 and 220-pounds, he has 
above-average 4.8 speed in the 40 and a lot of room to fill out. "Matt is a 
quick-footed youngster who explodes off the ball," the Lemming report said. He 
also plays tight end on offense and averaged 10 points as forward for the 
basketball team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Clayvand Thomas (Carson, defensive back) -- On the field, there is little doubt 
about the ability of Thomas. Regarded by most scouts as one of the premier 
defensive backs in the state, the 6-0 and 175 Thomas returned three 
interceptions for touchdowns last season. He is especially adept at man-to-man 
coverage. But there are lingering questions about his physical condition after 
he broke a knee cap and wrist in an auto accident earlier this year. He has 
also incurred his share of disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Stewart (Granada Hills High, defensive back) -- At first glance, it 
might be a little surprising that Stewart is considered among the top 
prospects. After all, he didn't produce a lot of impressive statistics as a 
junior, but there are a lot of things scouts like about the 5-11 and 185-pound 
Stewart. "He reacts well to the ball and he hits like a ton," one report said. 
While he didn't have any interceptions as a junior, he did have six quarterback 
sacks and plays with a lot of emotion. He also plays basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ross (Simi Valley Royal, defensive back) -- It is unusual for Royal, a 
school that has never been a CIF Southern Section power, to have a blue-chip 
prospect, but Ross is an exception. The 6-4 and 205-pound Ross is one of the 
most versatile players on the Terrific 22. He plays strong safety and 
intercepted four passes last year, but could develop into an outside linebacker 
in college. He will also see time at tight end and wide receiver for Royal. 
Ross runs the 40 in 4.6 seconds, has leaped 6-7 in the high jump and plays 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Reser (Muir, defensive back) -- Reser, at 5-10 and 175 pounds, is not 
the biggest defensive back around, but he makes up for any size deficiency with 
his 4.5 speed in the 40. He is also a vicious hitter. "He's the hit man you 
want for your secondary who is athletic enough to play corner, too," SuperPrep 
said. Recruiters call him a pure college cornerback. He had four interceptions 
and forced three fumbles as a junior. He will also play running back this 
season.

CAL POLY POMONA WOMEN OPEN VOLLEYBALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's volleyball team, ranked No. 17 in NCAA Division II 
by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn., will open its 1990 season by playing 
in the Christ College Tournament on Friday and Saturday in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament will also mark the debut of first-year Coach Gene Krieger, who 
developed a top National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics women's volleyball 
program at Cal Baptist in Riverside. He will inherit a Pomona squad that 
finished 16-18 and was 4-8 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will open tournament pool play against Mt. Saint Mary's at 2:30 p.m. 
Friday before facing Cal State Stanislaus and Cal State San Bernardino later in 
the day. The Broncos also meet Alaska-Fairbanks and Point Loma Nazarene in pool 
play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The top teams will advance to the semifinals at 3 p.m. Saturday and the 
championship match is at 6:45. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will be led by left side hitters Jody Fee and Dina Gutierrez, right 
side hitter Alicia Burns and middle hitter Linda Tschasar. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Wiesner will open his first season as coach of the Cal Poly Pomona men's 
soccer team when the Broncos play host to Sonona State at 8 p.m. Saturday at 
Kellogg Field in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner, who also coaches the Pomona women's squad, will take over a men's team 
that finished 4-14-1 last season and 2-8 in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos return 12 lettermen, including senior forward Steve Bayer and 
sophomore forward Carlo Casella. Bayer was the team's second-leading scorer 
last season with three goals and two assists and Casella scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona women also open their season with a game against Sonoma State at 6 
p.m. Saturday at Kellogg Field. Pomona, which finished 8-10-2 last season, has 
11 players returning, including senior midfielder Amy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco Tech High has named John Castelli, who has coached the school's freshmen 
basketball team the past seven years, as its athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Castelli replaces William Nuanes, who resigned to devote more time to coaching 
the varsity basketball team. Nuanes had been coach and athletic director the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Castelli is a graduate of Bosco Tech and Cal State Los Angeles and played for 
Bosco Tech in 1961 and 1962.

MAYAN CULTURE FINDS A HAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: L.A.'S IXIM CENTER PROMOTES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL 
EXPRESSION OF MAYAN REFUGEES FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once home to elegant restaurants and apartments, the streets of the Pico-Union 
District are now tired and unkept. Wrought iron guards many of the storefronts 
and weeds have overrun the spaces that concrete and trash have missed. 
</P>
<P>
It's a stark contrast to the lush green mountains and verdant countryside of 
Central America, yet the neighborhood has become home to the greatest 
concentration of Salvadorans outside El Salvador and the largest number of 
Guatemalans outside Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
These refugees, victims of war and poverty, plant their dreams in the cement 
and hope for the best. For Samuel Simon, the ground has proved fertile. 
</P>
<P>
"Here there are many opportunities, and if I put my mind to it, I can succeed," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
In Simon's homeland, Guatemala, the outlook was much bleaker. A Mayan Indian, 
Simon watched a succession of governments rob his people of their language, 
tradition and culture before fleeing 3 1/2 years ago in advance of a forced 
recruitment sweep by the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I left," he says, "is fear." 
</P>
<P>
And among the reasons he stays is culture. Although Mayan customs have been 
forcibly repressed in Guatemala since the time of the Spanish Conquest, they 
have found a home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
IXIM, the center for the integration of indigenous Mayas, was founded more than 
a decade ago to promote the community development and cultural expression of 
Maya refugees. IXIM (pronounced ee-SHEEM) takes its name from the Mayan word 
for corn, which, according to folk tradition, was the substance used by the 
Gods to create the first Mayans. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, 24, is the secretary of IXIM as well as the director of the center's 
most visible component, its marimba band. The group will perform as part of the 
Los Angeles Festival on Sunday, from 12:45 p.m. until 1:30 next to the La 
Placita church in Olvera Street, and again from 3 until 5 p.m. at Union 
Station. Both concerts are free. 
</P>
<P>
Although descendants of the ancient Mayan civilizations are often lumped 
together, they represent 23 distinct groups and 100 dialects in Guatemala 
alone. The majority of Mayans in Los Angeles speak languages of the 
Q'anjob'alan subfamily, which dominates the highland regions of the Department 
of Huehuetenango. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, a Kanjobal Mayan, comes from the city of Santa Eulalia in western 
Huehuetenango, less than 30 miles from the Mexican border. There he worked as a 
teacher, a profession that earned him the respect of his people and the 
suspicion of his government. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a campaign to knock off the Indians' leaders . . . the teachers and 
such," says Father James Curtain, the Catholic priest who founded IXIM in 1979 
after more than three decades of work among the indigenous peoples of 
Guatemala. Curtain, 71, now lives at the Maryknoll Residence in Los Altos, 
south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Indians are considered subversives by the military," Curtain said. 
"There is general repression against the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
The repression turned to genocide under the military rule of generals Romeo 
Lucas Garcia (1978-82) and Efrain Rios Montt (1982-83), who unleashed a brutal 
counterinsurgency campaign in the countryside. Ostensibly, it was intended to 
give the army the upper hand in its long war against anti-government 
guerrillas. But in reality, it led to the massacre of more than 50,000 
indigenous Guatemalans and forced hundreds of thousands more into exile, 
according to a study by a branch of the Guatemalan Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional culture has also been a casualty of war. Out of fear, many Mayan 
women no longer wear the traditional and colorful huipil dresses, which reveal 
their Indian roots. And children are taught Spanish at home rather than their 
native dialect to help them blend in. 
</P>
<P>
According to Curtain, that leaves most indigenous Guatemalans "stuck in a kind 
of in-between place -- afraid to be recognized as an Indians, but not accepted 
by the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big job," he said, "is to get them to be proud of their culture and their 
heritage. To be proud of what they are. To preserve their culture." 
</P>
<P>
It's a task Samuel Simon has accepted with fervor. The son of a musician, Simon 
learned to play marimba at the age of 6. That talent, combined with his skill 
as a teacher, made Simon the obvious choice to teach and direct IXIM's five 
marimbistas. 
</P>
<P>
The marimba -- as common in highland Guatemala as a piano or guitar in the 
United States -- has an important place in Mayan tradition. For centuries it 
has been central to both religious and social celebrations. In areas such as 
Huehuetenango, where 85% of the people are descendants of the Maya, marimba 
bands have traditionally traveled from town to town to play in local fiestas. 
If the band is good, the status of its villages grows; if a band is bad, the 
village can be disgraced. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's village, Santa Eulalia, is a hotbed for marimba players, among them 
Simon's father. But like most Guatemalan marimbistas, Simon never learned to 
read music. Instead, he plays by ear, learning new tunes by memorizing the 
music from cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a gift I have," he says. "Here, I don't have many other interests. 
Playing the marimba is the only thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Simon has precious little time to devote to his music. Like the other 
members of IXIM's band, he works every day but Sunday in a garment district 
shop where, in a good week, he will make $200. He also spends two nights a week 
at a trade school studying to be a radio announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Simon already has a radio show of his own, broadcasting in Spanish twice weekly 
to parts of San Bernardino and Riverside. Ironically, the commercial music he 
plays on the radio is one of the obstacles he says immigrants face in trying to 
preserve their culture in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes modernization changes the roots of a culture," he says. "It would be 
similar to us forgetting our culture. But with (IXIM), it's different because 
we practice our culture like it was before. We change nothing. It's important 
that we conserve the Mayan and Kanjobal culture so that people can know it." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who fled Guatemala with his uncle and entered this country illegally, 
lives with six other men in a small house in the shadow of the Harbor Freeway. 
His immediate future depends on the outcome of his political asylum request, 
which is still pending with the INS. The odds for a favorable review, however, 
are long -- less than 3% of those Guatemalans seeking political asylum won 
their cases last year, despite overwhelming evidence that government-sponsored 
repression continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse," Curtain says. "Anybody that protests against what's going on is 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more ominous is the fact that retired general Rios Montt, an architect 
of the Mayan holocaust, is running for the presidency as a civilian. Elections 
are scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
With prospects for the future so dim, it would seem difficult to remain 
optimistic. Yet Simon, displaying a stoicism typical of the Mayans, says he has 
few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made many sacrifices, but I have everything," he says. "I feel much 
stronger about my culture here than there. I feel more Kanjobal. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more possibilities here to practice my culture. There are 
possibilities here than I ever knew existed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the INS gives my asylum, I'll stay. If not, I'll go back."

AT LONG LAST, SHIRLEY;

<P>
OPENING NIGHT: AFTER A FOUR-MONTH POSTPONEMENT, SHIRLEY MACLAINE GARNERS AN 
ENTHUSIASTIC OVATION FOR HER HER LATEST MUSICAL REVUE.

"Thank you for waiting," said Shirley MacLaine as she left the stage to a 
standing ovation at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre on Tuesday night. She didn't 
mean waiting for the end of the show. The opening of her musical revue, "Out 
There Tonight," had been delayed four months when she tore the cartilage in her 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
"I need the kind of nourishment you get from an audience," MacLaine said at the 
post-performance party in the Pantages' Art Deco-goes-Baroque lobby. It's the 
kind of dramatic theater the czars might have built for the Bolshoi. 
</P>
<P>
"I need the truth of an audience," she added. "Machines don't give it to you. 
The camera doesn't give it to you. It's something you can only get from a live 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, she got it performing for the 2,000-strong crowd, and then in 
personal compliments from the 200 guests invited for the buffet afterward. 
Among them were Olivia Newton-John, Bea Arthur, Brooke Adams, Roddy McDowall, 
Robert Blake, Barry Manilow, Robert Downey Jr. with Sarah Jessica Parker, AFI 
director Jean Firstenberg and Democratic activist Roz Wyman. 
</P>
<P>
"She puts us all to shame," said Esther Williams. "We're all home with our 
grandchildren, and she's out there performing. We're sitting on our laurels 
while she's out making new ones." 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg said she was so impressed by the scene from "Gypsy" that she 
thought MacLaine should be touring with the musical. "If I had the money, I'd 
mount the show myself," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides reveling in the audience appreciation, MacLaine also spoke highly of 
the Pantages, which was built in the late 1920s when Hollywood Boulevard was a 
chic promenade. She called it "a great theater. You can feel the other people 
who've been in here. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in 40 movies and I've played 12 hookers," she said. "Maybe that's 
why I feel comfortable in this part of town."

FABLED 'FILLE'; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET PACIFICA STAGES THE DANCE THAT DARED TO TELL A STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two weeks before the French stormed the Bastille on July 14, 1789, and launched 
their political revolution, "La Fille mal gardee" began a revolution of its own 
in the ballet world. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, ballets often had been mere strings of formal dances hung upon a 
plot line, usually about gods and goddesses in disguise or make-believe 
shepherds and shepherdesses. 
</P>
<P>
But with "Fille" (The Badly Guarded Daughter), ballet began to tell a definite 
story, with every dance flowing directly out of a situation and advancing the 
plot. And the characters became real people, farmers and peasants. Well, 
reasonably real people. 
</P>
<P>
The plot concerns the efforts of the lovers, Lise and Colas, to thwart the 
efforts of Lise's mother (Widow Simone) to marry her off to someone she doesn't 
love. The ballet combines comedy, pantomime, farce, as well as lyrical and 
virtuoso dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Jean Dauberval apparently found inspiration for his ballet in a 
colored print he saw one day in a shop window, of a youth fleeing from a 
cottage, an angry old woman throwing his hat after him and a peasant girl 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
(Such a print was actually found a century later in the Paris National Library 
by the British ballet historian and critic Cyril Beaumont.) 
</P>
<P>
The Dauberval version -- which premiered under a different title -- was 
originally danced to popular French folk songs and tunes. But when the ballet 
arrived at the Paris Opera in 1828, a new score for it was composed by 
Ferdinand Herold. Unencumbered by copyright laws, incidentally, Herold lifted 
themes from Rossini's "La Cenerentola" and "Il barbiere di Siviglia," but also 
wrote much delightful music of his own. 
</P>
<P>
When the ballet made it to Berlin in 1864, composer Peter Ludwig Hertel created 
yet another new score. But it is Herold's music, in various arrangements and 
orchestrations, that is usually heard today. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ballet is the oldest in the current repertory, virtually nothing 
survives of Dauberval's original choreography. Later versions have been created 
by Petipa and Ivanov (the "Swan Lake" team), Mikhail Mordkin, Bronislava 
Nijinska and others. 
</P>
<P>
British choreographer Frederick Ashton created his version for the Royal Ballet 
in 1960, and it was this version that was danced by the Joffrey Ballet at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One of the constants throughout, however, remains a tradition of a man dancing 
the role of Widow Simone en travesti. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica will dance choreography by founding director Lila Zali, after 
the version by Russian dancer and choreographer Mikhail Mordkin. 
</P>
<P>
Zali was in the New York-based Mordkin Ballet from 1938 until it became the 
nucleus of American Ballet Theatre in 1940. (She later joined the Colonel de 
Basil Ballet Russe, which disbanded in 1946.) 
</P>
<P>
"I was very young, and danced primarily in the corps de ballet," Zali said in a 
recent phone interview. "But you watched everything that went on." 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica has been dancing the work since 1969, according to Zali. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very challenging technically for the girl (Lise), and also in terms of 
the acting, of course. Being a comedy, there has to be a lot of acting." 
</P>
<P>
But financial concerns will rule out the traditional clog dance for Widow 
Simone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to find any kind of clogs you can really dance in," Zali 
said. "He wears clogs, but takes them off to dance. To dance in, they have to 
be specially made and cost a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
What 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica will dance Lila Zali's "La Fille mal gardee" (after Mordkin) 
and "Arabesque" (music by Bach).

Rob Becker thinks too many of his fellow comedians are getting cheap laughs at 
the expense of men. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of the few comics around who doesn't come out and say, 'Men are pigs,' 
" says Becker, who comes to the Irvine Improv Tuesday, Sept. 4. "I don't think 
men are pigs. I think women just misinterpret their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the differences between the sexes has become the bedrock of 
Becker's act. "I used to think men and women were just alike," Becker says. "I 
used to think that until I got married. . . . I think there are some basic 
differences in the way we see the world." 
</P>
<P>
Men, for instance, don't relate to the concept of shopping for things they have 
no intention of buying. "My wife will say, 'Imagine this in our house.' I have 
to say, 'Honey, that doesn't belong to us,' " Becker says. "For me to like 
something, I have to be able to afford it." 
</P>
<P>
His take on the sexes doesn't always go over, he admits. "Some women get 
(angry) about it, to tell you the truth," he says. But most women, he claims, 
"appreciate what I do." And the men? "I get a lot of guys who come up to me 
(and say), 'Thanks for explaining me to my wife,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to recognize the differences but not to dwell on them. "That's the 
whole challenge of a relationship," Becker says. "You have to meet in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
Becker is an animated performer who has enjoyed a fast rise since moving to Los 
Angeles from San Francisco a year ago. He won a coveted spot on "Late Night 
With David Letterman" in April and is in the midst of negotiating his second 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Even while touring heavily, Becker says he has found time to build up lots of 
new material since his last Improv dates in April. "This last year has been 
real fertile for me," he says. "I've come up with a lot of new stuff." 
</P>
<P>

GOOD TIMING: Some Wall Street wizards say the secret to investment success is 
knowing when to sell. . . . Buck A. Mickel, a director of Irvine-based Fluor 
Corp., picked a good time. . . . He sold 56,835 shares of Fluor for $45.375 a 
share on July 24, pocketing $2,578,888. . . . Nine days later the company's 
stock plummeted, in part in reaction to the Middle East crisis. If he had 
waited until yesterday to sell, he'd be about $500,000 poorer. Dan Crump and

BILL TO FORCE DEPORTATION OF FELONS PASSES ASSEMBLY, 42-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill modeled after an Orange County judge's attempts to force the deportation 
of illegal aliens convicted of drug-related or violent crimes cleared the state 
Assembly on Wednesday and its author predicted that it will be signed into law 
by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be flabbergasted if the governor vetoed it," said state Sen. John 
Seymour (R-Anaheim), soon after the Assembly approved his bill by a 42-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which Seymour expects to easily win final legislative passage this 
week in the Senate, has two central features: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It would require the state Department of Corrections to refer to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service the names of all drug-related and 
violent felons serving time in California prisons and whose appeals had been 
exhausted. The INS would then screen the names to determine whether the felon 
was a legal resident, or deportable as an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It would give county trial court judges the authority to refer the names of 
similar drug-related or violent felons to the INS. Again, it would be up to the 
INS to evaluate the residency status of each felon. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said that his bill was inspired by the efforts of Orange County 
Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who for 20 months has invited INS agents 
into his Santa Ana courtroom to identify aliens convicted of a range of 
felonies and probation violations. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by Carter's court staff show that in 1989, about 35% -- 834 
of the 2,366 offenders screened by the INS -- were identified as illegal 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Both Seymour and Carter, a Democrat who once ran unsuccessfully for Congress, 
said Wednesday that they hoped the legislation will lighten the burdens of 
clogged county probation departments and the state prison and parole systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our taxpayers should not be required to pay for those illegal aliens who reek 
havoc and victimize our citizens," Seymour said. "If they are convicted, they 
should serve their time and then be sent back to the country they came from. 
There should be no parole or probation." 
</P>
<P>
And although both Seymour and Carter said Wednesday that they hoped the 
legislation would encourage the INS to shift its emphasis to deporting 
convicted felons instead of hunting suspected aliens at job sites, opponents of 
the measure expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the legislation will have the effect of re-routing the 
priorities of the INS," said Francisco Lobaco, a lobbyist in Sacramento for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Lobaco said the ACLU does not like the measure because it promotes "the 
inaccurate image of the immigrant as a major source of crime." Nevertheless, 
Lobaco said he was pleased that both Seymour and the measure's principal 
co-author, Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), agreed to amendments which he 
said guard against due-process infringements. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the INS in Los Angeles said he could not comment on the 
legislation, Senate Bill 1745, without having read it. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, meanwhile, said that the most important question in assessing the 
bill's potential impact will be whether it prompts the INS to vigilantly screen 
and seek deportation of those illegal aliens convicted of drug-related or 
violent acts.

NAVY RESERVISTS CHECK IN, BEGIN ADJUSTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kimberly Graftenreed, 23, was forced to give up her Hermosa Beach apartment to 
cope with the pay cut. San Diego anesthesiologist Winnie Varley-Maneclang, 49, 
moved in with her daughter in Orange County to lighten the daily commute. And 
Mohan Vallabhapurapu, 35, missed his chance to serve as a line judge in the 
U.S. Open tennis tournament, now under way in New York. 
</P>
<P>
They were but three of the 80 Navy reservists who streamed into the Long Beach 
Naval Hospital Wednesday morning, duffel bags dangling from their shoulders and 
uncertainty etched on their faces. Dressed in gleaming white uniforms, they had 
assembled in orderly fashion to help replace 150 doctors, nurses and 
technicians who have been deployed in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene that is being repeated in communities across the nation this 
week as thousands trade civilian lives for active duty in the largest 
mobilization of the selective reserve since the 1961 Berlin crisis. Almost 
50,000 military reservists could be called up by Oct. 1, putting their everyday 
lives on hold for at least 90 days as the Persian Gulf crisis plays itself out. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach reservists, like those elsewhere in the nation, are a diverse 
lot. Some will earn as little as $895-a-month base pay; a handful will get more 
than $4,000 a month. They range in age from 19 to 55 and come from all walks of 
life: a Los Angeles police officer, a real estate agent, a housewife, a nursing 
college student, a mail carrier, even an embalming assistant from the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that your appearance here this morning has been greatly anticipated and 
much appreciated is the height of understatement," said the hospital's 
commanding officer, Capt. F.G. Sanford, as he greeted the erstwhile "weekend 
warriors" who assembled in an auditorium at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree that the mobilization will have a dramatic impact on their lives, 
forcing them to make sacrifices in finances, short-term goals, and in some 
cases, housing or hairstyles. But they add that these are adjustments that they 
are prepared -- in most cases, quite willingly -- to make. 
</P>
<P>
Graftenreed, a pharmaceuticals buyer for the Thrifty Corp., said she had been 
planning to spend last weekend watching a pro volleyball championship on the 
shores of the Pacific, within walking distance of her apartment. After 
receiving a 4 a.m. call-up telephone call last Saturday, she spent her time 
scurrying for cheaper housing, settling finally for an inland apartment that 
she will share with a fellow reservist. 
</P>
<P>
"The base pay doesn't even cover my rent in Hermosa," explained Graftenreed, 
who flipped through a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine during slow moments of the 
orientation. "But patriotically speaking, I feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's session began with a long round of bureaucratic form-filling. 
Laughter permeated the auditorium only once -- when a young ensign asked the 
new charges to check off a box indicating whether they had been activated for 
duty or shown up on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the reservists received mixed news from Master Chief Phillip Dozier, 
whose responsibilities include morale and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing "the quality of life issue," Dozier announced that tickets will be 
made available to Disneyland and Dodgers games. But, he added, "eccentric 
haircuts" are out. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Stringer, 23, a Cal State Long Beach nursing student with a modified 
pompadour, cringed at the latter announcement. "I guess that means I am going 
to be going to the barber," he said later. "It's just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
In the modern day, equal-opportunity Navy, Kellie Hosch was facing a similar 
problem. Last week, she had gone to a Beverly Hills salon for a spiky hairdo. 
"I have a faddish hairstyle. Now I'll have to comb it out like a geek," she 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns centered on substance rather than style. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief question-and-answer session, Los Angeles Police Officer Lanita 
Elias, 23, asked Navy officials whether she can temporarily defer paying bills 
because of the large pay cut she is facing. "That, unfortunately, will be the 
lending institutions' call," came the unsettling reply. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three months, the reservists, most of whom are members of the Long 
Beach-based Navy Hospital Reserve Unit 119, will assist in the hospital's 
operating room, orthopedics unit and outpatient clinics, Sanford said. In 
recent days, non-emergency services have been scaled back as seven physicians 
and more than 140 nurses and technicians have departed to participate in 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Varley-Maneclang is the only doctor among those activated to serve at 
the Long Beach hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This creates a lot of disturbance and disruption of your regular life," she 
said. "But this is what we're trained for." 
</P>
<P>
A former Navy officer, the Filipino-born physician is currently a staff 
anesthesiologist at Kaiser Medical Center in San Diego, where she says she 
earns $10,000 a month. As a reservist, she will earn less than half that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
But Varley-Maneclang seemed less concerned Wednesday about her pay cut than 
about her new living arrangements -- having temporarily traded life with her 
husband in San Diego for life with her 23-year-old daughter, who lives in La 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter doesn't like the idea of my being her roommate," Varley-Maneclang 
smiled. "That's because I have rules." 
</P>
<P>
A handful of reservists who are reporting to Long Beach from Sacramento, Dallas 
and Memphis will need temporary housing in barracks, Sanford said. But members 
of the Long Beach unit -- at least those who can afford to -- will continue 
living in their homes, and in certain cases may even receive permission to 
moonlight to help make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
For a lucky few, including David Bookrum, the call-up will result in little 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Bookrum, the senior enlisted adviser of Reserve Unit 119, already works at Long 
Beach Naval Hospital as a civilian risk manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be pretty much the same," he said. "Except now when I get up, I will 
be putting on a uniform rather than a shirt and tie."

LAGUNA ATTACK ON GRANNY FLATS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: A JUDGE UPHOLDS THE CITY'S CRACKDOWN, MEANING THAT OWNERS OF SOME 
SECOND UNITS MAY HAVE TO DISMANTLE THEM OR APPLY FOR SPECIAL PERMITS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Wednesday let stand Laguna Beach's crackdown on bootleg 
apartments, a decision which could affect up to 600 residents in one of the 
most bitter fights in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William F. McDonald partially rejected a class-action lawsuit which 
alleged that the city illegally tried to eliminate South Laguna's bootleg 
apartments. Those apartments had proliferated under more relaxed county 
standards before the area was annexed to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means many bootleg owners may have to immediately dismantle their 
illegal second units, apply for permits, or face civil charges. But many 
residents have said that they depend on the income from those apartments, also 
called granny flats, to make their mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the people who are really going to suffer," said Mary Reynolds, 
president of the Assn. for the Preservation of Diversity in South Laguna, which 
was formed to protect bootleg property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said the city has placed property owners in a Catch-22 situation 
because they must apply for special permits despite the fact that their 
apartments don't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Some South Laguna residents have railed against the second units, arguing that 
they create shabby neighborhoods and nearly impassable streets. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Viviani, who has fought against bootleg apartments, said Wednesday: "I'm 
elated. I think it really is a victory for the city." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Smith, an attorney for the homeowners, said he will appeal the ruling. 
But Smith said he was "very gratified" by some of the judge's findings on 
points of law in the case. Ultimately, he said, he is confident that his 
clients will win. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased we prevailed on almost every legal issue we submitted to 
the court except the actual outcome," Smith said. "We acknowledge it is a 
complicated decision. It is a very difficult issue." 
</P>
<P>
The suit focused on the city's crackdown during an 18-month period from 
December, 1987, until June, 1989, when a city ordinance was adopted regulating 
the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, South Laguna residents said they received threatening letters 
from the city, insisting that they dismantle their second units immediately or 
sign an agreement that would give them up to five years to get rid of the 
apartments or bring them up to code. The agreement exempted residents over 60 
as long as they owned the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Vigilante groups," the plaintiffs had complained, turned on their neighbors 
and gave names of suspected bootleg apartment owners to city officials, an 
action that divided the community. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs say the city's action violated the spirit of a state law which 
encourages second units to provide more housing and which relaxes some 
standards for them. The plaintiffs asked the court to give them 18 months to 
modify their apartments to meet those state standards. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, McDonald agreed that the state standards did apply during that 
18-month period. But he said he agreed with the city that the permit 
applications received during that time were incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Phil Kohn said that City Council members probably will do one of two 
things at their meeting Tuesday. They will either require bootleg owners to 
immediately dismantle the apartments or apply for a conditional use permit, or 
they may allow owners to sign the previously offered agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Harold L. Wilson, one of two named plaintiffs in the class-action suit, had 
refused to sign the agreement because he said it places a "cloud on the title" 
and means lenders will not refinance the home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm let down," Wilson said Wednesday. "My sense of outrage and injury against 
the city is not diminished at all by the adverse decision of the court. I 
heartily concur with the attorney's decision to appeal."

COUNCIL REJECTS MOTEL CONVERSION

<P>
The City Council this week ordered owners of a board-and-care facility on 
Lincoln Avenue to stop operating because of concerns that the rooms were being 
rented illegally as apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The council refused to grant Maria Machado of Cerritos a conditional use permit 
to convert the facility into a motel because of fears that guests would 
continue to live there on a long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1978, the property operated as the Jumbo Inn motel. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Machado, Bob Gilbert told the council that more than half 
of the people staying at the facility are long-term residents. The majority of 
them are poor and would be out on the streets if the $10-a-night facility were 
shut down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have people they just don't want to evict," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert asked the council to give Machado six more months to operate. He said 
that Machado was trying to sell the property and needed the income from the 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a unanimous vote, the council decided that without significant 
changes to the building that Machado is not prepared to make, the building 
would continue to be used as apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in good conscience could approve this as a hotel," Councilman John 
Kanel said. "It is not the right place to have this." 
</P>
<P>
Zoning on that portion of Lincoln Avenue does not allow for residential 
establishments such as apartments. LYNDA NATALI

<P>
With a tradition of apple strudel, bratwurst and the ever-popular schuhplattler 
dancers, the Phoenix Club's booth at the Orange International Street Fair 
promises once again to be "almost like Munich," said Dietrich Hoffmann, event 
chairman for the German-American organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based club is one of more than 90 groups sponsoring food stands at 
the 18th annual street fair this weekend in downtown Orange. 
</P>
<P>
One of the original participants in the fair, The Phoenix Club's booth is also 
one of the event's most popular attractions, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make that much money, but we keep everyone happy," Hoffmann said. 
"The food never stops." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the group sold 18,000 bratwurst sausages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to German food and beer, the group will present schuhplattler 
dancers, a troupe of 20 "shoe clappers" who will perform traditional folk 
dances. They will share the stage with The Connections, a local Bavarian band 
that will play oompah music. 
</P>
<P>
Belly-dancing and mariachi music, Irish, Greek, jazz and bluegrass will also be 
heard on the fair's eight stages throughout the weekend. Japanese, Greek, 
Irish, Turkish, Italian, Mexican and other ethnic groups will sponsor food 
booths. 
</P>
<P>
"This really represents all of Orange County," said Gail Hewitt, vice president 
of the fair committee. 
</P>
<P>
Also featured are 80 arts and crafts stands selling everything from 
hand-painted T-shirts to cowboy hats. 
</P>
<P>
At the Children's Village in Plaza Circle, youngsters are invited to be 
photographed with members of the Orange Fire Department. Police Department 
representatives will take childrens' fingerprints free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Fair hours are Friday from 5 to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m. MARY HELEN BERG

BOMB IN PARKING STRUCTURE IS DEFUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department bomb squad dismantled an explosive device on Wednesday 
that had been left overnight in a parking structure near a commercial office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had exploded, it would have caused extensive damage to the parking 
structure and to nearby vehicles," Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been fatal to anyone nearby." 
</P>
<P>
The device, concealed in a briefcase, was reported to police about 9 a.m. by a 
passer-by who said it looked suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a little toggle switch on it and an indicator light like you would find 
on an appliance," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb squad went to the garage, at 4400 MacArthur Blvd. next to a Sanwa Bank 
California, and sent in a mechanical robot to the bottom floor of the two-story 
structure to examine the device. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs and X-rays were taken before demolition experts worked for several 
hours to defuse the explosive. Although police did not evacuate the nearby 
office building, officials at Sanwa reportedly evacuated their workers as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who work in the office building told investigators that they had 
seen the briefcase in the parking structure about 10 p.m. Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The commotion piqued the interest of many of the nearby office workers. Jeff 
Miller, an employee of Barton, Klugman &amp; Oetting Law Offices said people in 
his office weren't too scared because authorities had informed them that if the 
device did explode, it probably would not harm the office building. "These 
things are just scare tactics," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Wednesday were baffled as to who may have left the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who placed it there or why," Newman said.MATT LAIT

'PIERFEST' TO RAISE MONEY FOR NEW PIER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of a German "beerfest." But are you ready for a "pierfest?" 
</P>
<P>
Old World Village has announced it will be launching its traditional, 
month-long beerfest on Sept. 8 with "a pierfest night" to raise money for a new 
pier for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts at 6:30 p.m. . . . and all proceeds from the $5 admission cost will 
go to the pier," said Bern Bischof, coordinator of the fund-raising event. 
"We're calling it a pierfest because it's the first night of our September 
beerfest." 
</P>
<P>
A band from West Germany will provide live music, and there will be door prizes 
and raffles, Bischof said. There will be a Miss Oktoberfest competition, and 
the judges will include Mayor Thomas J. Mays, Bischof said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this because we're residents of Huntington Beach, and the pier is 
the heart of Huntington Beach," Bischof said. "The pier here is known all over 
the world, and our goal is to help raise money for the new pier." 
</P>
<P>
Activities will include the chance to sample various beers and vote on them. 
</P>
<P>
"'Because of the recent reunification movement in Germany, we'll be able to let 
people taste East German beer along with beers from West Germany," Bischof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Old World Village is on Center Avenue north of the Huntington Center Mall. BILL

RIDGELINE PROTECTION QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials have verified that a citizens' group has gathered enough 
signatures to place a ridgeline protection ordinance before Laguna Niguel 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline Protection and Preservation 
Committee delivered almost 5,000 signatures to City Hall in support of an 
initiative designed to protect undeveloped hilltops throughout the city. County 
officials found that 922 signatures were invalid, but enough valid signatures 
were verified to call a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members have said they will pursue a special election unless the City 
Council approves their ridgeline preservation proposal. A separate proposal to 
protect ridgelines and govern hillside development has been prepared for the 
city by Lawrence Associates of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to differing setback requirements, the consultant's hillside 
development ordinance would give city officials discretion in dealing with 
individual projects. City officials say the committee's ordinance is too 
strict, rendering some property "undevelopable" and placing Laguna Niguel at 
legal risk. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners took their first look at the two plans at their Aug. 14 
meeting. City officials have indicated that they will continue considering both 
ordinances, possibly incorporating the best elements of each plans. The 
Planning Commission is expected to again consider the ordinances Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Should the council reject the initiative at its next meeting on Tuesday and 
approve a separate ordinance, a special election would be called in about 90 
days. If the ridgeline protection ordinance were approved by voters and the two 
ordinances were to conflict in the future, the voter-approved ordinance would 
take precedence, City Atty. Terry Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
With organizational help from the county, a special election in Laguna Niguel 
would cost taxpayers about $25,000, said assistant registrar of voters Rosalyn 
Lever. Without county assistance, the cost could rise to $60,000, City Clerk 
Juanita Zarilla said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While many city ridgelines are already sprouting construction, committee 
members say their ordinance could preserve other hilltops "currently at risk" 
of being developed. The proposal targets skylines visible from "scenic 
highways" such as Coast Highway and Crown Valley Parkway. The initiative 
pinpoints hilltops between Pacific Coast Highway and Pacific Island Drive -- 
such as property next to the Monarch Point housing development -- and 
ridgelines between the southwestern area of Laguna Niguel and San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for owners of land that borders South Laguna, commonly known as the 
Binion property, said land would be "dramatically affected" by either 
ordinance. A tentative tract map for 32 homes on that parcel was recently 
submitted to the city. LESLIE EARNEST

DEDICATION FOR OVERDUE EXHIBIT HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight Anaheim officials and community residents will dedicate the newest 
addition to the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
In opening ceremonies for Hall D, Mayor Fred Hunter will pitch the first ball 
from the mound of a temporary baseball diamond constructed inside the new space 
to illustrate the roominess of the 150,000-square-foot exhibit area. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the festivities there is bound to be grumbling about the Taylor 
Woodrow Construction Co., whom the city claims was just over six months late in 
completing the $30-million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hurt us," said Hunter, citing both lost revenue and damage to the 
center's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit hall, a parking structure of the same size and an additional 
adjacent parking structure have been under construction since May, 1988. The 
additions were scheduled to be finished on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
According to Taylor Woodrow Vice President William Ostfield, the hall "has been 
usable for its intended purpose since June 4, 1990." 
</P>
<P>
However, the city maintains that the hall was not ready for use until the 
middle of this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It could've been built in 20 months. . . . It's just been a battle throughout 
the whole thing," said Gary Binger, Taylor Woodrow project manager. "There have 
been numerous problems relating to subcontractors, architects and the owners. 
There's also our own problems. . . . We don't claim to be totally innocent, but 
we don't feel totally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor-Woodrow's contract with the city holds the company liable for damages of 
$5,000 for each day past the Feb. 27 deadline that construction was incomplete. 
Taylor Woodrow has declined to specify reasons for the delay but plans to file 
claims with the city explaining the problems in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A few dozen trade shows were counting on the new hall to house their 
attractions, and the city has lost still untabulated revenues from these shows. 
The convention center generates about $1 billion in revenues annually. 
</P>
<P>
One tenant, International Tile Exposition, filed a $20-million suit against the 
city in May and sought a temporary injunction to use the facility. 
</P>
<P>
That injunction was denied, but the suit still stands, charging the city with 
misrepresentation and breach of contract. The city claims that it is not liable 
under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow, which has been under fire for its construction delays at John 
Wayne Airport, notified the city last November that the convention center 
project would not be finished until May, 1990. LISA MASCARO

PEOPLE: AFTER 50 YEARS, PRIEST TAKES A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While preparing for priesthood, Msgr. Francis Roughan told himself: "Roughan, 
you are a generous character to give up marriage and family life to get to 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
He came from a loving family with four brothers, all of them born at home. 
</P>
<P>
After becoming a priest and learning more about what he calls the heroics and 
challenges of married life, he had another chat with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Roughan, you were just a coward. It would have taken more courage to be a real 
fine spouse and parent then to be a priest," he told himself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 50 years later, the recently retired pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe 
Catholic Church in La Habra is even more awed by the rigors of marriage and 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
But he prepared himself well to help the estimated 1,000 couples he has married 
and counseled. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Roughan became chairman of a church-sponsored marriage 
preparation course "and that was the time we were really getting into 
engagement encounters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was often asked how a priest can be knowledgeable about marriage and its 
strains. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them the story about another priest who would tell his people that he 
never laid an egg, but he was a better judge of an omelet than any chicken," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He explains that priests are able to get close to people from infancy through 
adulthood, and one of the reasons is that priests don't have marriages or 
families of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-born priest said everyone knows they have an equal claim on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Belonging to no one means you belong to everyone," said Roughan, 74, who was 
recently honored by upward of 550 parishioners, friends and 65 priests at a 
"Golden Jubilee of Priestly Ordination" celebration of his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He was defined by a fellow priest as "a prince of a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
Roughan avoids the use of the word retirement since he daily continues to 
celebrate Mass and visit hospitals and convalescent homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirement indicates inactivity," said the Los Angeles Loyola High School 
graduate, and although admitting he has slowed a bit, "I'm not inactive. I'm 
carrying out most of my duties. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean any changes except someone else becomes the pastor," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time Los Angeles College Seminary student is also forthright about his 
feelings about what he calls "outlawing" the name of God in schools and other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"When something is outlawed it makes it sound like it is condemned," he said. 
"It's a tragedy that legislative bodies have gone to that extent to not mention 
the word of God. They are committing moral suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Roughan, who once cured a stuttering problem with singing lessons, believes the 
ruling has even more far-reaching effects. 
</P>
<P>
He claims that when young people grow up lacking a sense of reverence for God, 
"they are not apt to have much consideration in pleasing a fellow creature. 
They become self-centered." 
</P>
<P>
And while Roughan has spent most of his life counseling others, he has helped 
himself with a fine golf game. 
</P>
<P>
Roughan, whose parents were born in Ireland but met in Hollywood, once broke 
par at the Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed it was the luck of the Irish . It happened on St. Patrick's Day in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after delivering an estimated 4,000 babies, Dr. Dave David, 39, got 
one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Each baby I've had the privilege of delivering has been perfect," he said. 
"But somehow this one is even more perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach physician and his wife Jeri named their 6-pound, 11-ounce son 
Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, David will be able to bring his own family to the annual 
picnic he hosts for the families of babies he has delivered. 
</P>
<P>
David, a Laguna Beach resident, is also the star of "Making Womb for Baby!," a 
comprehensive video on pregnancy and childbirth.

FORMER LAGUNA SCHOOL TRUSTEE ELMER BROWN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elmer Brown, a former Laguna Beach Unified School District trustee, died of 
cancer Wednesday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a longtime Laguna resident, was chairman of Laguna Travel Service, the 
county's third oldest travel agency, founded in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Brown bought the agency in 1953. Before that he was in the construction 
business, building six different housing projects in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Brown met his wife, Ruth, a doctor, at a general store he owned in Keene, 
Calif. While his four children were attending public school, Brown decided to 
run for the school board in 1954 because he felt it was his civic duty, his 
wife said. During his tenure, the school district underwent tremendous growth 
as the city itself grew in population. 
</P>
<P>
After his term ended, Brown returned to private life and never ran for public 
office again. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles, Brown attended UCLA, where he graduated in 1934 with a 
degree in accounting. He later served as an Army finance officer during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, Brown is survived by four children and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Friday at 9:30 a.m. at Laguna Beach 
Presbyterian Church.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS FIT ONLY FOR MOUNTAIN GOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to play baseball on a slope, but that hasn't mattered much when you 
consider Orange County's pathetic approach to securing parklands from 
developers. The Board of Supervisors has a regrettable record of allowing 
developers to set aside unusable land for parks, or to pay fees that are far 
less than needed to develop adequate recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County does have several large regional parks, many new 
developments have been short-changed on neighborhood parks. For example, 
recently incorporated Laguna Niguel has turned away dozens of Little League 
players for lack of practice fields. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that flat, well-located land is also best for building houses. 
And that's how the developers who are well-connected politically in Orange 
County make their profits. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, cities and counties can require developers to donate parklands 
in return for permission to build houses. Orange County's quota is 2.5 acres of 
parkland per 1,000 new residents. Twenty-six of the county's 29 cities -- all 
but Fountain Valley, Orange and Villa Park -- have similar requirements. But 
county records show that, all too often, developers have been allowed to 
satisfy quotas with brushland or steep slopes, or by paying in-lieu fees far 
below what it costs to purchase parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the county has raised in-lieu fees to respond to rising land 
costs, which in some areas have shot up to $1 million or more per acre. But 
over time, there has been a tragic and permanent loss of parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Some recently incorporated cities are organizing to prevent further loss. They 
would do well to follow the model of Anaheim, which refuses to give park credit 
for land with a slope of 20% or more. There, city residents turn out in force 
when the City Council makes parkland decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors should implement recommendations made by the county 
Environmental Management Agency to raise the park-dedication requirement to 3 
acres per 1,000 residents, and force more developers to donate usable land 
instead of in-lieu fees. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe things aren't what they once were in San Diego, where a development firm 
was allowed to count back yards as part of its parks requirement. But 
irreversible decisions have been made in Orange County that have left 
communities without adequate, usable parks. This deplorable record must be 
corrected so that baseball and other recreational activities can be played on 
level fields.

NEBRASKA'S BROWN VALUES LESSON LEARNED OFF FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LINCOLN, Neb. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Brown's feet are a blur as he tucks the football under his arm, sidesteps 
a defensive tackle and drags a linebacker into the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a football always has been easy for Derek Brown, ever since he 
strapped on his helmet and raced through the youth leagues in La Habra. He just 
wishes life's options came as easily as they do in football. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has been on the University of Nebraska campus for more than a year, but 
the closest he had come to the football field was installing the plumbing in 
the stadium's weight room expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting out a year after failing to meet academic requirements has its price. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even want to watch practice," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
But on this humid, 90-degree August day, Brown is the one being watched. He's 
back in full gear, playing in his first full-contact scrimmage as a college 
I-back. 
</P>
<P>
He shows few ill effects from the layoff. His first carry, a sweep to the 
right, gained eight yards. Three plays off tackle netted 15 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
After gaining 28 yards in six carries, Brown was pulled from the scrimmage by 
running backs coach Frank Solich. Solich told Brown he was done for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Brown said. "I want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Solich grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"Then go ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown carried two more times, gaining eight yards, before the scrimmage ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset when they took me out," Brown said, who moved up from the freshman 
team to second-string varsity in only a week of practice. "I went to (Solich) 
and told him I wanted a fair shot. All I want is a chance. That's why I came 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities weren't exactly abundant when you came to Lincoln a year ago, 
were they, Derek? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, you're second-string as a freshman, and the folks back home will get to 
see you on TV when the Cornhuskers open their season Saturday at home against 
Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
But last August, you loaded your belongings into the back of your Toyota and 
left La Habra, wondering if you'd ever get to play. You hoped, someday, to show 
why you were named Southern California's top high school player in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
When you arrived here, there were no scholarships, no free meals, room or board 
waiting for you. 
</P>
<P>
There were only bills for tuition, books and dormitory rent. While the other 
freshmen were learning how to run 47-gap, you were fitting together water pipes 
with a local plumber. 
</P>
<P>
You had no complaints, Derek. Neither did your friend, Johnny Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Both of you were All-Americans in high school -- Brown as a tailback at Servite 
and Mitchell as a tight end at Chicago Simeon. You were both considered the top 
players in a promising freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
At least on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
While scoring touchdowns wasn't a problem for you, scoring on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test was. You had to sit out your freshman year after failing to meet 
Proposition 48's academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Both of you came to Lincoln anyway, enrolled in classes and worked. Nebraska 
coaches encouraged you to take classes to prepare you for another entrance 
exam, the American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches showed me where Johnny and I could get help," Brown said. "But 
they couldn't help us. We had to do it on our own. It was all up to us." 
</P>
<P>
The plumbing company you were with landed a major project -- expansion of 
Nebraska's strength complex. You were on campus every day, working in the 
weight room instead of working out. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been so much tougher if Johnny wouldn't have been there too," 
Brown said. "He had to go through the same things I did. We would get up early 
to go to work, finish about 3:30 and then go lift together." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Epley, Nebraska's strength and conditioning coach, watched as you and 
Johnny installed the new ceiling sprinklers. He encouraged you to enroll in his 
conditioning course to keep in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Epley's training program made you stronger, Derek. You gained nine pounds, all 
muscle, and dropped your time in the 40-yard dash by nearly three-tenths of a 
second. Epley says you made unbelievable progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of Derek's life hasn't been such a smooth road," Epley said. "The 
academic problems pushed him to take a job he didn't want to, just to make ends 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a rocky time, and that stressed him in a lot of ways. But I never saw 
that in the weight room. He put it all behind him. You have to admire a guy for 
going through all that adversity, but he's still got a few roads ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Brown knows hard work, and its rewards. After all, things don't come easy 
to a guy who says, "Life's hard, things happen," with the detachment that tells 
you he's studied the subject. 
</P>
<P>
His father and mother were divorced when he was too young to understand why. 
When he wasn't playing football, he and his brother, Mark, worked part-time to 
help pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm not working, that puts a lot of pressure on my mom (Shirley)," Brown 
said. "I want to do my part. I feel I have to. Since my father left, I guess I 
put myself in the position of being the head man. That's pretty hard on me 
because I'm still young and sometimes I just don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
So football became Brown's break. The first time he touched the ball in a high 
school game, on a kick return, he ran it back 90 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
He finished his three-year career at Servite with 4,663 yards rushing, second 
on Orange County's all-time list to Valencia's Ray Pallares (5,398 yards). 
Brown rushed for 2,301 yards as a senior, a county single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
But those statistics and numbers meant nothing to Brown once he got to 
Nebraska. Ask him his favorite number and he won't tell you 21, his jersey 
number. It's 19, his passing score on the ACT last January. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell passed the test two weeks after Brown did. Both players learned they 
had four years of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Brown and Mitchell didn't celebrate their test scores. Instead, Brown 
publicly criticized the concept of taking entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it," he said. "I think it's real stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he has no problem with the academic requirements, but he objects to 
paying to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense," he said. "The SAT and ACT are just trying to get 
your money. You could be a 4.0 student and you could still get a low score on 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
"The tests have nothing to do with your schoolwork. I totally dislike them. 
They should go by how you did in school." 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska linebacker Mike Petko, a former Servite teammate, understood Brown's 
frustration. Petko struggled to maintain a C-average at Servite, eventually 
transferring to Katella midway through his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
But at Nebraska, Petko has a 3.2 grade-point average in consumer science, with 
a concentration in finance and stock market trading. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek's the kind of guy who takes on everything with a challenge," Petko said. 
"He handled the whole situation like a man. He performed to the task, and 
that's what you have to do. That's just the kind of guy Derek is." 
</P>
<P>
With his academic problems behind him, Brown was eager to show his Nebraska 
teammates and coaches why he was one of the most sought-after high school 
running backs in the nation a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 2,516 points on the school's athletic index, which measures an 
athlete's power, strength, speed and jumping ability. 
</P>
<P>
His score was the highest by a Nebraska freshman running back and was second 
overall to Mitchell among this year's freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 5-feet-10 and 179 pounds, led the freshmen in three categories: 10-yard 
dash (1.51 seconds), 40-yard dash (4.49 seconds, electronically timed, 4.35 
hand-timed) and the agility run (3.96 seconds). 
</P>
<P>
Epley said Brown spent his time during the layoff wisely. 
</P>
<P>
"You can let something like that destroy you," Epley said. "You can get slower 
or faster during that time. But Derek adjusted to his situation and made the 
most of it. Our motto here is the great ones adjust, and that certainly applies 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he had something to prove the first week of practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt disrespected by some of the players," Brown said. "They were hearing 
all this stuff about me. They didn't want to hear it, they wanted to see it. 
All I wanted to do was put on the pads and show what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
He also showed the coaching staff a thing or two. Solich, who has coached 
Nebraska backs Mike Rozier, Roger Craig, Doug DuBose and Tom Rathman, said 
Brown's work ethic ranks among the best he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be on the field every second," Solich said. "If you look back at 
the great backs we've had here, they all have that work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Epley agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek has set a good example for a lot of players who don't have their grades 
in line," Epley said. "Maybe athletes can save themselves a lot of problems by 
getting their grades in order and not waste a year of their life. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek has turned things around, but he has paid the price."

HUMPHERY IS ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: SINCE BEING MOVED TO THE RIGHT SIDE, VETERAN CORNERBACK SAYS HE MUST BE 
PREPARED TO BE TESTED BY QUARTERBACKS.

<P>
Unless you can talk a mile-a-minute, spew boxing cliches like left jabs, demand 
a trade every week or so, complain religiously about San Francisco 49er 
salaries, or dream up a zany armed forces salute for your defensive 
coordinator, you can't really replace LeRoy Irvin at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
So, naturally, Bobby Humphery isn't trying. Let's just say Humphery is assuming 
the right corner position once rented by Irvin, who was released last spring by 
the Rams after 10 seasons of notes and quotes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Humphery, acquired on draft day from the New York Jets for a 
fifth-round pick, has been as controversial as a sunrise, and just about as 
consistent. The questions concerning Humphery's cover abilities, or lack 
thereof, have given way to some answers. 
</P>
<P>
Humphery, 28, has intercepted passes in each of the past two exhibition games, 
although he said those plays were no big deals in establishing himself as a 
Ram. 
</P>
<P>
"It may help," he said, "but I don't see it that way. I'm just trying to show 
the coaches and the team that I can contribute to what they have. That's my 
ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, more than others, have been sold on Humphery for some time, even 
after one of their own, Flipper Anderson, beat him deep in a game last season. 
Humphery, in turn, has taken to his new environment with caution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taking a new job," he said. "You come out and do the best you can, 
and try to do what the company asks you to do, and do it to the best of your 
ability. That's the way I've looked at that. I'm just trying to let them accept 
me as a player and try to do the things they want to see in a player." 
</P>
<P>
When the trade was made, Humphery was supposed to play left corner and lend 
veteran leadership to Darryl Henley, the projected starter at right corner. 
</P>
<P>
But since Henley's hip injury, Jerry Gray has been moved from free safety back 
to left corner, with Humphery switching to right corner. And that may not be 
such a great deal for the new corner in town. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because opponents figured to pick more on Henley and his inexperience than 
on Humphery, an eight-year veteran. But with Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl 
selection, back at corner, quarterbacks, given a choice, will probably prefer 
working against Humphery. 
</P>
<P>
Is he prepared? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to be," he said. "I can see why, because he (Gray) is very 
talented and he's very smart. I'm trying to get as comfortable as he is. If 
they want to come to my side, I'm going to be up to the task. I'm going to have 
to be up to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Humphery said other teams used the same strategy in the years he played in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much that I was the weak link, but it was just because teams are 
mostly right-handed and that's the way they chose to attack us," he said. "I'm 
used to being thrown at a lot. I've got to be up for the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Gary Jeter, who played six years with the Rams before signing a 
two-year deal with New England in 1989, was released Tuesday by the Patriots, 
but has told reporters there he still wants to play. 
</P>
<P>
Given the Rams' current crisis at defensive line, might the 35-year-old Jeter 
return to Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably talk to him," Coach John Robinson said. "Just to see where 
he is, see how he's doing. He had an injury early in camp that's pretty close 
to being healed." 
</P>
<P>
Jeter, suffering from hip and thigh injuries, had not played for the Patriots 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams offered Jeter a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1989, but 
he left as a Plan B free agent to New England, which offered him two years and 
some enticing guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Jeter received $250,000 in base salary last season and a $200,000 reporting 
bonus, plus other incentives. His 1990 base salary of $250,000 was not 
guaranteed, however, leaving the Rams some room to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, his last year with the Rams, Jeter recorded 11 1/2 sacks, second on 
the team to Kevin Greene's 16 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mel Owens, the 10-year veteran linebacker, is still bedridden with his back 
injury. He's allowed to get up one hour per day for physical therapy. Owens 
originally injured his back in training camp at UC Irvine. He aggravated it on 
the long plane rides to and from Berlin, and wrenched it completely Aug. 18 in 
a game against San Diego. "It was like stripping gears," he said. "What can you 
say? That's football." There is no timetable on Owens' return. . . . New punter 
Keith English reported to camp and worked out with the team Wednesday. He said 
he figured something was up with the Rams when the Chargers gave him every kick 
in the Aug. 18 game at Anaheim Stadium. Turns out San Diego was showcasing 
English, who was a free agent last year who couldn't catch on with the Raiders. 
English said he spent a total of three exhibition games with the Raiders but 
didn't kick in a game. "It's kind of tough when you're a free agent coming out 
of college and they won't let you kick in preseason," English said.

SEASON KICKS OFF, HAWAIIAN-STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: CAPISTRANO VALLEY, TUSTIN AND EDISON OPEN IN ALOHA STATE 
AGAINST LOCAL TEAMS.

<P>
The 1990 Orange County prep football season will kick off Hawaiian-style with 
three county teams playing their openers at Aloha Stadium on island of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the county's top-ranked team in 1989, starts at 3:30 p.m. 
(PDT) today against Honolulu Damien in the Skip Akina Classic, which honors a 
former University of Hawaii player who died in an automobile accident. In the 
featured game of four, Canyon Country Canyon plays Honolulu St. Louis late 
tonight. St. Louis has a 55-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin and Edison will begin their seasons Friday; Tustin plays Pac-5 at 9 p.m. 
(PDT) and Edison faces Honolulu Iolani at 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches at the three Orange County schools said the primary reason for making 
the long trip to open the season is to establish team unity in anticipation of 
a big year. All three teams are expected to be ranked among the county's top 10 
in the preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
"If you play high school football, you'll hopefully have some great memories, 
and a trip to Hawaii certainly should be a great experience for our players," 
Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley's fund-raising drive got an assist from the Rams, who 
scheduled a rookie scrimmage against the San Diego Chargers on July 26 at the 
school's football stadium with ticket proceeds going toward the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold about 2,000 tickets and raised about $5,500 from the game," Patton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Capistrano Valley lost an overtime game to eventual champion 
Paramount in the Division III semifinals, finishing 12-1. The Cougars have some 
of the county's top returning skilled-position players, including quarterback 
Tony Solliday, wide receiver Dave Poltl, free safety Jeremy Brion and running 
back Chris Adams. Adams is injured and will not play today. 
</P>
<P>
Damien, a small Catholic school, will have a large partisan crowd on its side. 
Administrators closed the school to allow the students to attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich has set up camp on the northern-most spot on the 
island to prepare for the Tillers' opener. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Mokuleia, 40 miles north of Honolulu, has been home for Tustin players 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The only distraction out here is once in a while the wind comes up," Ancich 
said. "Or (assistant coach) Vince Brown falls off a surfboard. The beach here 
is untouchable. This is my third trip to Hawaii and this is the most fun we've 
had. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not staying in a fancy hotel in Waikiki, but this isn't Kuwait out here. 
It's like a summer camp. The kids are staying in cabins and we're practicing at 
Waialua High right next to the water." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin will field a talented and experienced backfield led by quarterback Andy 
Borza and running backs Visko Ancich and Ron Goods. Shad Vickers, an Irvine 
transfer, will start at free safety and alternate at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Pac-5 is a team made up of five small private schools on Oahu. Ancich said the 
school uses a double slot offense and throws 35-40 passes per game. 
</P>
<P>
This is Edison's third trip to Hawaii. Dave White made his head coaching debut 
in 1986 with a victory over St. Anthony on Maui; the Chargers beat Punahou on 
their first trip in 1982 when White was an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Edison players earned their way for the trip by selling advertisements 
for the team's program. Players earned 50% of any new advertisement that was 
sold with a full-page ad selling for $400. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one player, Greg Seybert, collect over $1,000 and he brought his 
younger brother over with him," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has the biggest traveling party among the three schools with 225, 
including the sophomore team, cheerleaders and parents. The sophomore team will 
play Iolani's junior varsity team today. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for Aloha Stadium's turf field, Edison will practice today on the 
turf at the University of Hawaii. And White had 24 pairs of turf shoes 
delivered for his skill-position players. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Edison advanced to the semifinals of the Division I playoffs 
before losing to the state's top-ranked team, Fontana. White lost the majority 
of his starters to graduation, but Mike Cunningham, a gifted wide receiver, 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham averaged 20.7 yards per reception and scored five touchdowns despite 
missing four games with a broken thumb.

LUCZAJ, READY TO BUILD, WANTS PAST TO BE HISTORY AT BUENA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Luczaj knows what to do with the artifacts of a losing football program 
-- relegate them to the dumpster of history. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about the past," Luczaj said from his office at Buena Park High 
School. "We don't deal with the past. We've tried to change anything that we 
possibly, humanly, know how and that's what we do." 
</P>
<P>
At Buena Park, where Luczaj is attempting to right his second Freeway League 
football program in 10 years, there's a lot of negative history to bury. The 
Coyotes last qualified for the playoffs in 1981. Until last season, they hadn't 
won a league game since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in 1981 during his first year at Fullerton High, Luczaj has attempted 
to wipe away reminders of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, there's no talk of the 28 consecutive league losses, a 
six-season streak that ended last year. The white helmets of years past have 
been replaced by green ones and new jerseys have been acquired. Luczaj enlisted 
the players to clear out and wash the weight room "from the roof to the floor" 
so it could be re-painted. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a part of Luczaj's psychological sales job -- trying to convince 
players at a school with little football tradition that they can be successful. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Luczaj took over a struggling Freeway League football program, he 
led Fullerton to the league championship in 1981, but it might not go so 
smoothly the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Luczaj isn't the unknown sophomore team coach he was when he 
took over at Fullerton. Luczaj may have been out of Freeway League football 
since he resigned at Fullerton after the 1986 season, but his reputation as a 
resuscitator of football programs is still strong. 
</P>
<P>
For another, with the players the Coyotes have returning, Buena Park doesn't 
figure to challenge the consensus favorites -- Sunny Hills and Troy. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sunny Hills didn't lose a game until it met the eventual Division 
VI champion, Corona del Mar, in the semifinals of the playoffs. And the Lancers 
likely will be strong again despite losing all-division running back Brian 
Pizula, who gained 1,226 yards and scored 19 touchdowns during the regular 
season, and the bulk of their offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Overby, who gained more than six yards per carry last season, and Mike 
Sullivan, who gained more than eight per carry as a wingback, should pick up 
the slack for the Sunny Hills running game. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the season Troy, which has qualified for the playoffs in John 
Turek's first six years as coach but has never won a league championship, 
breaks through. Warrior quarterback Greg Windle was a first-team all-league 
selection as a junior and his receivers, Steve Friedrich and Chad Hartford, are 
two of the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunny Hills and Troy, the league is difficult to handicap. La Habra 
missed the playoffs only three times in the '80s, but one of those times was 
last season, and the Highlanders will have to replace their quarterback and two 
top rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Buena Park, Fullerton and Sonora have new coaches this season. Former 
Chaffey College defensive coordinator Pat Ward takes over at Fullerton, which 
finished third last season, and former San Gabriel Coach Terry Cox assumes 
responsibility for Sonora, which finished last. 
</P>
<P>
With D.C. Olsen, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound linebacker, Fullerton has one of the 
league's best hitters -- he set a county record with 13 home runs and batted 
.595 for the Fullerton baseball team last season -- and his move from the 
offensive line to fullback likely scares many a defensive coach. 
</P>
<P>
Cox has tried to bolster Sonora, which has only seven returning lettermen, by 
disbanding the sophomore team and promoting the players to the varsity. Cox 
said only 23 of the 41 players truly belong on the varsity. Quarterback Ryan 
Lewis, who missed the league season last year with an injured shoulder, returns 
and he'll be protected by two of the bigger linemen in the league, Scott DeBie 
(6-2, 245) and Robert White (6-5, 270). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Medellin, a part-time starter at quarterback last season, is one of only 
three experienced offensive players for Buena Park and the Coyotes' defense is 
just as green. 
</P>
<P>
"It dawns on me every time I look out at practice that we're not very big and 
not very fast," Luczaj said. 
</P>
<P>
But Luczaj said he is glad to be back coaching football in the Freeway League. 
He returns after two seasons as baseball coach at Fullerton High and two as an 
assistant coach for the Fullerton College football team. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj resigned the Fullerton High football job partly because he couldn't get 
any assistant coaches hired as full-time teachers, and he doesn't have any 
assistants who aren't walk-ons this time around. But his assistants, two of 
whom are Coyotes' assistants from last year, are experienced, Luczaj said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park's program is in similar shape as Fullerton's in 1981, Luczaj said, 
and the players are taking to the system well. But the tradition of losing runs 
deep at Buena Park, which last won a Freeway League football championship in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj, however, believes the school has had enough of that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that everybody's to the point that they're tired of losing," he said. 
"Hopefully, we can change things. But I don't know, I'm not a miracle worker." 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow: Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Martin Luczaj (first year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 3-7, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 15 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Mark Medellin, QB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Mike Kennedy, OT, 6-0, 220, 
Sr.; Bryan Baylor, TE-DL, 6-2, 215, Jr.; Shane Langenberg, DB, 5-11, 175, Sr.; 
Albert Trujillo, DB, 5-8, 160, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Angel Barrios, RB-LB, 6-2, 215, Jr.; Robert Starks, RB-LB, 5-10, 
200, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Coyotes ended a 28-game league losing streak last season, but they 
still have only won one league game since 1983 and last made the playoffs in 
1981. Without defensive back/running back Malcolm King (Cal State Fullerton) 
and linemen Jim Perricone (Cal State Fullerton) and Jason James (Fresno State), 
who earned Division I football scholarships, the Coyotes lose quite a bit of 
talent, but returning quarterback Medellin and a two young running 
back/linebackers, Barrios and Starks, give Luczaj reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pat Ward (first year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 7-4, 3-2 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 20 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four on offense, five on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: D.C. Olsen, LB-FB, 6-1, 220, Sr.; Jimmy Peterson, WR-DB, 5-10, 
175, Sr.; Brian Wilber, C-DL, 6-4, 250, Jr.; Ben Iuli, DL-OL, 6-4, 260, Jr.; 
Daniel Chacon, QB-DB, 5-9, 160, Jr.; David Chacon, RB-DB, 5-9, 165, Jr., Shawn 
Pearson, OL-LB, 5-9, 190, Jr.; Joey Hernandez, LB-RB, 5-10, 185, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Kelle Whitehurst, TE-DE, 6-3, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: In his first head coaching position, Ward, the defensive coordinator 
at Chaffey College the past three years, will be faced with the task of 
replacing quarterback Rene Arias, a three-year starter and three-sport 
all-league player. But Ward says junior Daniel Chacon, who played cornerback 
last year, will be a capable replacement. And of course, the Indians have D.C. 
Olsen, possibly the league's best athlete, at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jack Nicholls (third year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 4-6, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 17 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Matt Smith, C, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Herman Hernandez, OL, 6-3, 245, 
Sr.; Mike Mooney, FB-LB, 6-2, 200, Jr.; Frank Saiz, RB-DB, 5-8, 155, Sr.; John 
Ledieff, OL-DL, 6-1, 205, Jr.; Don Anderson, DL-FB, 6-0, 180, Sr.; Pat Gleason, 
LB, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Greg Mitchell, QB, 6-2, 190, Sr.; 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Steve Busch, WR, 5-8, 140, So.; Matt Moreno, RB-DB, 5-10, 150, 
Jr.; Jason Johnson, RB-DB, 5-9, 160, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Highlanders missed the playoffs last season for the first time 
since they forfeited two league games in 1987. Greg Mitchell, starting free 
safety and backup quarterback last season, takes over at quarterback for Mark 
Moreno. Whether they can return to playoffs probably depends more on the young 
runners who replace Mark Brown and Jeff Besinaiz, who gained more than 1,300 
yards between them last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Terry Cox (first year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 2-8, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Seven 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three on offense, two on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Ryan Lewis, QB-DB, 6-0, 195, Sr.; Scott DeBie, C-DL, 6-2, 245, 
Jr.; Robert White, OL-DL, 6-5, 270, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Deron Drake, RB, 5-10, 170, Jr.; Danny White, LB, 5-10, 175, 
Jr.; Scott Spears, LB, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Tim Gorman, LB, 5-7, 165, Jr.; Todd 
Fletcher, DL, 6-2, 185, Jr.; Kurtis Lucero, DB-WR, 5-10, 165, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Cox is faced with a task that humbled five coaches during the 1980s -- 
turning around Sonora's football program. Cox, the former San Gabriel coach, 
replaces Larry Allen, who resigned after winning one league game in two years. 
Cox says attitudes have improved. Among those who should contribute are 
quarterback Lewis, who injured his shoulder and missed the league games last 
year, and Drake, who gained more than 2,000 yards in two years for lower-level 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tim Devaney (11th year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 12-1, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 21 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Six on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Ken Overby, RB-LB, 5-11, 195, Sr.; Mike Sullivan, RB-DB, 5-11, 
185, Sr.; Steve Choe, DB-WR, 5-9, 175, Sr.; Brian Gluhak, LB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; 
David Wilde, DB-WR, 5-8, 170, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Marlon Womack, RB, 6-2, 195, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Leading rusher Brian Pizula has graduated. But with Overby and 
Sullivan, who each averaged more than six yards a carry last season, returning 
to the backfield, the defending league champs' ground game shouldn't suffer 
despite the loss of linemen Robert Sung (6-1, 235), Darren Correll (6-2, 255) 
and Pat Marshall (6-1, 230). On defense, where the Lancers shut out six 
opponents last season, the situation on the line is unclear. But Devaney is 
confident in the linebacker corps, headed by Overby, and the secondary, which 
includes Sullivan and Choe, a three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Turek (seventh year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 7-4, 4-1 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 20 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Nine on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Greg Windle, QB, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Steve Friedrich, WR-DB, 5-11, 
170, Sr.; Chad Hartford, TE-DB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Chad Brasington, RB, 6-1, 195, 
Sr.; Jeff Dorsz, OL, 6-5, 255, Sr.; Robert Blankmeyer, OL, 5-10, 200, Sr.; 
Bodie Berg, C, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Ryan Russell, WR, 5-8, 145, Sr.; Marty Gomez, DE, 
5-10, 175, Jr.; Robert Long, DT, 6-1, 190, Sr.; Bryan Ferguson, LB, 6-1, 180, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jim Falletta, TE-LB, 6-4, 205, Jr.; Roger Cruz, DL, 6-2, 220, 
Sr.; Brent Coon, DB-RB, 6-1, 185, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With Windle (the league's top quarterback), Friedrich (one of the top 
receivers), tight end Hartford and flanker Russell (both second-team all-league 
receivers), running back Brasington and all but two of the offensive line 
returning, Troy might have the firepower to challenge Sunny Hills, the 
defending champions.

EX-MAI EMPLOYEES SETTLE INSIDER CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE THREE WERE ACCUSED BY THE SEC WITH TRADING ON UNPUBLISHED 
INFORMATION IN ATTEMPTED TAKEOVER OF PRIME COMPUTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRISTINA LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three former employees of MAI Basic Four Inc., including two top financial 
executives, settled civil charges Wednesday that they traded on inside 
information about MAI's planned takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc. in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission said that Dale T. Jabour of Santa Ana, 
Ronald Lee Thurman of Orange and Winston M. Cheong of Costa Mesa have agreed to 
settle the charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC alleged that Jabour, a former director of accounting at MAI, purchased 
Prime call options after overhearing two MAI executives discuss the Tustin 
computer company's planned takeover of Prime in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
MAI launched a surprise hostile tender offer for Prime on Nov. 15. Prime, a 
Natick, Mass., computer maker, rebuffed the MAI bid and after a protracted 
takeover fight, Prime agreed to be acquired by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New 
York investment firm, in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Jabour, 36, is accused of passing the non-public information to Thurman, 37, 
then director of financial planning at MAI, and Cheong, 31, a staff business 
analyst. The three executives bought a total of 375 options to purchase Prime 
common stock at prices between $15 and $17.50 per share, the SEC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
A call option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy 100 shares of a company 
stock at a predetermined price at a future date. For investors who think a 
stock may rise dramatically, such options permit a profit from a smaller 
investment than it would take to buy the stock. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC alleged that Jabour and Cheong sold their Prime options three days 
after MAI publicly announced its bid for Prime. Jabour realized $21,800 in 
profits and Cheong made $3,830. Thurman sold his Prime options within two weeks 
and, because of a decline in the stock's price, profited only $1,875, the SEC 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Federal securities laws prohibit company employees from trading on sensitive 
information before it has been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Before the SEC action, Jabour returned his $21,800 in alleged illegal profits 
to the party that sold him the Prime options, said James W. Mercer, Jabour's 
Los Angeles attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Dale has suffered a lot and is glad this is over," Mercer said. He said Jabour 
is now employed as a corporate controller for another Southern California 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand Weidberg, MAI's general counsel, said Jabour told MAI management in 
February, 1989, that he had purchased Prime options based on non-public 
information, and then resigned weeks later. The company was unaware of Thurman 
and Cheong's involvement "until literally hours before their resignation" 
within the past month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman, who has been ordered to pay $3,750 in restitution and fines, would not 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cheong, who will have to pay $7,660 in restitution and fines, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the profits involved were relatively small, James L. Sanders, the SEC 
regional administrator in Los Angeles, said this will send a message to others. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the three executives could face criminal charges if they violate 
the SEC injunction prohibiting them from engaging in securities violations in 
the future.

FUNDAMERICA'S FOUNDER ORDERED TO GIVE UP PASSPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Florida judge presiding over a criminal case against FundAmerica founder 
Robert T. Edwards ordered the Newport Beach resident to surrender his passport 
Wednesday but denied the prosecution's request to increase his $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is facing charges of organized fraud, securities fraud and running an 
illegal lottery or pyramid scheme in Florida. Authorities claim that 
FundAmerica bilked consumers out of $8.2 million. If convicted, Edwards could 
receive 65 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's statewide prosecutor sought to increase Edward's bail because of 
concern he might flee the United States. In seeking the increase, authorities 
noted that he had wired more than $11 million to foreign entities before his 
arrest last month and that he had a prior record of trouble with authorities on 
three continents. 
</P>
<P>
But Circuit Court Judge Robert Conrad decided the $1-million bail was 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, placed a few additional restrictions on Edwards, who is 
living in a rented home near Balboa Island. For instance, Edwards, 49, had to 
surrender his passport and must provide the court with an itinerary at least 72 
hours in advance before returning to his native Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' appearance in court in Orlando marked his first public appearance 
since his arrest July 19. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica is under investigation in several states, including California, for 
allegedly operating illegal pyramid schemes. Florida is the only jurisdiction 
which has filed formal charges against the company. 
</P>
<P>
The company -- which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors -- has tried to distance itself from its former president, including 
cutting off all communications with him. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica's new management has steadfastly maintained that the company is a 
legitimate business. Company officials describe it as a consumer club offering 
members discounts on services such as travel and long-distance phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the criminal charges, Edwards is facing the prospect of paying a $20.4 
million fine sought earlier this week by Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth. 
</P>
<P>
He has until Sept. 4 to contest the attorney general's administrative action 
judgment. Edwards has said they will fight Butterworth's action and seek to 
litigate the matter in court. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is scheduled to be arraigned today on the criminal charges, and a trial 
date is expected to be set. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Edwards intends to stay and vigorously fight these serious charges," his 
attorney, Neal Sonnett, said in a statement. "We look forward to the trial of 
this case, and total vindication."

Seal of Approval: Trendy women's clothier The Wet Seal Inc. has announced a 35% 
sales increase over the comparable quarter last year in its company's first 
financial report since going public in July. 
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter ended Aug. 4, the Irvine retailer reported earnings of 
$2.27 million on sales of $27.7 million, contrasted with earnings of $1.19 
million on sales of $18 million for the comparable quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Chilvers, president and chief executive, attributed the sales increase 
partly to the fact that the company has opened more stores. Wet Seal ended its 
second quarter with 80 stores, up from 68 stores at the end of 1989's second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, existing stores reported sales increases of 11.4% before inflation, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Wet Seal, whose customers can watch rock videos on wall-mounted monitors as 
they shop, made its initial public stock offering in July, raising about $43 
million. The company has said the money will be used to repay loans, upgrade a 
computer system, expand its Irvine distribution center and open new stores. 
Thirteen new outlets are planned by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Besides California, Wet Seal has stores in Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and Florida.

Store Purchase Sought: National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., whose liquidation was 
ordered by a federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday, said Wednesday that company 
President Melvin Jaffee has been negotiating with the company's creditors' 
committee to purchase the retail chain's two operating stores. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley company said that other bidders are also making proposals 
regarding the home-improvement company's stores, which are located in Cathedral 
City and in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which once had 21 stores and 1,200 employees, had been trying to 
reorganize under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy since April, but continued losses 
forced it to seek a conversion to Chapter 7 liquidation.

Merger Falls Through: Nichols Institute, a medical laboratory chain based in 
San Juan Capistrano, said it has canceled its previously announced merger with 
Associated Laboratories Inc. of Los Gatos. "We just could not reach agreement 
on the terms," investor relations manager Marilyn Hauge said last week. The 
merger would have given Nichols its first regional diagnostic laboratory in the 
San Francisco area.

When Malina Kaulukukui of El Toro was married 24 years ago on the Hawaiian 
island of Oahu, friends, relatives and neighbors she had never met carted box 
after armload of fragrant pikake, plumeria and hibiscus blossoms to her home. 
</P>
<P>
"All these people brought flowers over because they had heard from auntie 
so-and-so who had heard from uncle so-and-so who had heard from a friend that 
we needed flowers for the wedding," she recalled the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Ohana, a Hawaiian word meaning family, or a "feeling of responsibility and 
connectedness," brought forth the show of communal support, just as it recently 
transformed an empty hall in Costa Mesa into a spirited Hawaiian luau, replete 
with traditional songs and hula dance, roast pig for 500 and heaps of 
home-grown flowers. 
</P>
<P>
For their annual aha'aina, or festival, members of an Orange County Hawaiian 
community group took to their gardens -- and their friends' and neighbors' 
gardens -- to string together delicate leis, fashion aromatic centerpieces and 
decorate the stage on which they performed. 
</P>
<P>
"That same sense of community exists here," said Kaulukukui, who helped prepare 
the meal by hand-mixing 100 pounds of poi -- the pasty gray starch that was 
once a staple of the Hawaiian diet -- with water to give it the right 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
But good times and get-togethers are not the sole pursuits of the Ainahau o 
Kaleponi Hawaiian Civic Club, just as life for Native Hawaiians living on the 
lush tropical islands isn't always a luau. 
</P>
<P>
The very people who once made Hawaii a land called Paradise are more prone to 
be in jail, drop out of school and live on the streets than any other ethnic 
group now living there. They also suffer the worst health, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the overall U.S. population, this group has a 34% higher mortality 
rate from heart disease, cancer, diabetes and all other causes of death, 
according to Dr. Larry Miiki, executive director of a Hawaiian health agency. 
Miiki and other experts attribute the plight largely to the effects of poverty, 
which prohibits access to good health care and proper nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach-based Hawaiian civic club aims to preserve and perpetuate 
Hawaiian culture in a state that has the most Hawaiians outside of the islands, 
most of them in Southern California. The 1980 census put the number at 24,245. 
More current unofficial estimates nearly double that. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions for many Native Hawaiians in the continental United States are just 
as dismal as those in Hawaii are for their counterparts, civic club members 
assert. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming health crisis among Native Hawaiians exists whether they live 
in Hawaii or not," said Janie Ka'ala Pang, the Hawaiian civic club's education 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
(Intermarriage has greatly diluted the Native Hawaiian population, but club 
members use the federal government's definition of Native Hawaiians as those 
who can trace any island ancestors to the time before British navy Capt. James 
Cook arrived in 1778.) 
</P>
<P>
Likening the situation to that of American Indians, Kaulukukui said it stems 
from the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by the U.S. government and the 
population's dominance by the "white man," which left Native Hawaiians an 
impoverished minority beset by persisting social and economic ills. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hawaiians who came to the continental United States seeking to better 
their lives have succeeded in their quest, said Kaulukukui, a clinical social 
worker born and raised in Honolulu, who specializes in minority issues. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kalehua, an engineer for Allied Signal Corp., an aircraft manufacturer in 
Torrance, said many of his friends, Native Hawaiians like himself, are 
aerospace engineers at Northrop Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Rockwell 
International. Others in the community say doctors, lawyers and business 
executives also make up the work force. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the majority of Hawaiians here work in blue-collar or 
entry-level jobs, limited by their lack of education. And many never rise above 
the poverty, discrimination and ill health they sought to escape, Kaulukukui 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is a cultural reluctance to ask for outside help and a 
reliance on ohana for financial assistance from friends within a tightly knit 
community. Fund-raisers, such as luaus or golf tournaments, are held frequently 
to meet the need, said Bobby Chun, owner of the Voice of Hawaii, a newsletter 
with a circulation of about 7,400 throughout the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"The news travels fast, if you need help; everyone donates," said Chun, senior 
vice president of Frederick Russell Brown Associates, an Encino firm that 
provides engineering consultants. "People lose their homes, you go ahead and 
help them. All the proceeds of these events will go to people who need them." 
</P>
<P>
But that kind of support goes only so far, said Kaulukukui, adding that 
erroneous views of Hawaiians compound the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a stereotype or illusion that Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 
are these exotic people who live a carefree life and sing songs and do a lot of 
dancing. Well, that's not true, but when that myth is perpetuated, people don't 
have to look at the realities." 
</P>
<P>
But a worse hindrance has to do with documenting need. When governmental 
agencies study social and economic levels, Hawaiians and other Pacific 
Islanders are generally lumped in with Asians, and thus their needs remain 
totally unrecognized or greatly underestimated, club members say. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Islanders are often the invisible race," said Kaulukukui, citing a 
1980 study by the federal government that surveyed Pacific Islanders in the 
same category as Asians. The study showed, for instance, that 11% of the group 
as a whole lived below the poverty line. But when Pacific Islanders were 
counted separately, 16% fell into that category. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, few studies have been done on the Hawaiian plight in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Berringer, a sociology professor of the University of Hawaii, wrote a 
report in 1989 that showed that as far as economic status, "there was not a lot 
of difference" between Hawaiians here and in Hawaii, Berringer said. 
</P>
<P>
Miiki, executive director of Papa Ola Lokahi, a federally funded agency 
creating health care programs in Hawaii, said he would "guess" that Native 
Hawaiians unassimilated into continental U.S. society would probably suffer 
similar ill health to those on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hawaii State Department of Health collects no data on Hawaiians outside 
of Hawaii, and studies done by the California State Department of 
Rehabilitation groups Hawaiians in with Pacific Islanders, said Takao Iwasa, 
the rehabilitation department's chief of statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau gives no current population projections on Hawaiians 
here because "the group is too small for the Census Bureau to make 
projections," said Michael J. Levin, a bureau social science analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Asian American Health Forum, a national advocacy agency in San 
Francisco that promotes improved health among Asians and Pacific Islanders in 
the United States, knows of no state or federal or private studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Data may have been collected, but it has not in any way been analyzed or 
disseminated," said Tessie Guillermo, forum executive director, adding that 
raw, unanalyzed data collected from the state health department confirms that 
"mainland Hawaiians do die in high numbers from the same causes as Hawaiians on 
the islands." 
</P>
<P>
"Like all Asian and Pacific Island subgroups, they are not considered a large 
enough group for anyone to give money to anyone who would want to do a study 
on," Guillermo said. "It's hard enough to get money to do studies on Pacific 
Islanders as an aggregate, let alone a subgroup." 
</P>
<P>
"We know they are very under-served," Guillermo continued. "But it's like a 
Catch-22. Unless you have data to prove they are a highly needy ethnic group, 
you can't get money to spend on improving their health. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This week, the Orange County Hawaiian civic club learned that it was turned 
down for a federal grant. Members had hoped to use the money to register Native 
Hawaiians here in order to address their medical, economic and educational 
needs with existing social services or to petition for more. 
</P>
<P>
Club members plan to reapply for the grant next spring. In the meantime, they, 
along with five other clubs belonging to the Mainland Council of Hawaiian Civic 
Clubs (in Los Angeles, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and 
Anchorage) will continue their volunteer efforts to register Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians are known not to ask for services," said Pang, who works as a nurse 
for Los Angeles County. "It is accepted in our culture to say we have to make 
due with what we've got. We want to help people reach out. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently sponsoring events from luaus to beauty pageants, California's 
Hawaiian community is as active as it is cohesive, members say. 
</P>
<P>
Some of its 100 clubs are primarily social and recreational. The 400-member 
Anaheim-based Kamaaina Club is dedicated to bowling and golf leagues, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Other clubs focus on tradition. The Hawaiian Inter-Club Council of Southern 
California, an umbrella organization of various groups, had its 11th annual 
Hawaiian festival this July. Drawing about 75,000 to Alondra Park in Lawndale, 
the event celebrating Polynesian culture is the largest of its kind outside of 
Hawaii, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
The Ainahau o Kaleponi Hawaiian Civic Club (ainahua means land of cool breezes; 
kaleponi translates to California) places cultural preservation first and 
foremost, but stresses health and welfare advocacy as well as the perpetuation 
of traditional song, dance and other cultural practices. 
</P>
<P>
One of six continental U.S. chapters of the Assn. of Hawaiian Civic Clubs, 
which has 40 groups in Hawaii, the group was formed in 1982 and now has more 
than 200 members paying dues that range from $10 to $35. 
</P>
<P>
Most members live in Orange County and about three-fourths are Native Hawaiian, 
said Pang, who is also a mainland council secretary. Officers must be Native 
Hawaiian but, like other clubs, it allows anyone to join, even non-Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Heather MacLean of Laguna Hills doesn't have a drop of Hawaiian blood. But she 
has been a club member for three years and sings with its chorale, scheduled to 
perform in the Los Angeles Festival at 3:45 p.m. Saturday at Angel's Gate 
Cultural Center and at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. Both 
sites are in San Pedro. "I belong because of the feeling of aloha, the love, 
the giving, the sharing, the good things in life," said MacLean, 36, who, like 
so many others, wore a long, loose-fitting muumuu to the club's recent luau in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the festivities was club founder Mary Ann Kauluwehi Kalama of 
Costa Mesa, a petite, feisty 86-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Affectionately known by all as "Auntie," she said she created the group after 
the national civic club association held its first convention outside of Hawaii 
at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion drummed up "overwhelming enthusiasm and interest," said Kalama, 
who blessed the luau in Hawaiian -- she is one of a scant few here who speak 
the language fluently -- and whooped when male dancers in red silk shirts 
stomped their feet and swiveled their hips. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's entertainers sang ancient meles, or songs, tapped and jiggled 
seed-filled instruments they crafted from bulbous gourds and golden chicken 
feathers, and performed hulas said to have been danced for Hawaiian alii, or 
royalty. 
</P>
<P>
All ages took the stage, but special emphasis was placed on younger members, 
the focus of the group's motto: "The culture of the land is preserved in its 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
Aana Mitchell, the club's master kumuhula, or hula teacher, voiced that 
commitment as she made an informal, parting speech before a move back to 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"My one goal in life is to teach our young people, more than that to see them 
carry it out," Mitchell said. "And I have seen them do that." 
</P>
<P>
Three academic scholarships totaling $10,000 (money raised from the event's $22 
admission) were awarded to teen-age members or children of members. Afterward, 
club president Hookaulana Carl Bode spoke privately of the critical role that 
education plays in improving the plight of many Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians have been at the top of the statistics list of anything that is 
bad," Bode said. "Maybe we are not going to change these things in our 
generation. But maybe we can make a start. We hope we can."

<P>
Summer is over and it's time to get back to the three Rs: rules, requirements 
and registration. For those who have not been through the process of getting 
into an Orange County elementary school, here's how you do it and what you 
need: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RULES 
</P>
<P>
Children entering kindergarten must be 5 years old on or before Dec. 2; 
children entering first grade and who have not attended kindergarten must be 6 
on or before Dec. 2. Pupils must attend public or private school or be in a 
tutoring situation from ages 6 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
All children entering first grade must have a physical examination. Parents 
have from 18 months before the child enters first grade until 90 days after 
school starts to have the child examined. (Children entering a California 
school for the first time must also have a physical examination.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE REQUIREMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Parents must provide school administrators with: 
</P>
<P>
* Verification of child's birth date (certified copy of birth certificate, 
baptism certificate, passport, immigration visa, or a notarized affidavit from 
parent, guardian, or custodian of the child when no other document is 
available). 
</P>
<P>
* A health certificate or medical record that indicates the child has had the 
requisite physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
* Written documentation of month/day/year of immunizations signed by the 
medical provider or a medical exemptions waiver signed by the parents if they 
have personal beliefs against such immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
Required immunizations are: 
</P>
<P>
* Three doses of polio plus one more if the last dose was given before the 
child's second birthday. 
</P>
<P>
* Four doses of DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) plus one more if the last 
dose was given before the child's second birthday. 
</P>
<P>
* Dose each of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) plus one more if any were given 
before the child's first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Schools will not admit children without the required immunizations or a waiver 
signed by the parent. You may have your children immunized by your physician or 
by the Orange County Health Care Agency at no charge. Locations are listed 
below. Immunizations are handled on a walk-in basis. 
</P>
<P>
* Address: 1725 W. 17th Street, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday; 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday 
and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* Address: 6462 Industry Way, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday; 4 to 8 p.m. Monday 
</P>
<P>
* Address: 7212 Orangethorpe Ave., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Thursday; 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
There are seven other locations throughout the county, but the hours and days 
of availability are less frequent. For more information on the immunization 
assistance project or for the address and hours of the clinic nearest you, call 
(714) 834-8560, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REGISTRATION 
</P>
<P>
If you do not know what school district you are in, call the Orange County 
Department of Education business office at (714) 966-4211. Once you know the 
district, call the appropriate district office to find out which public school 
your child should attend. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to go to your child's school and complete the registration 
process, providing the school with the aforementioned verification of birth, 
health certificates and immunization documentation.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: MECHANIC REVEALS GARAGE SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's worked for service stations, department stores, quick stops, tire and 
muffler shops, dealerships, distributors, and privately owned auto repair 
facilities -- both foreign and domestic. 
</P>
<P>
And if there's one thing Chris H. Stevenson of Huntington Beach learned during 
his 12 years as a professional mechanic, service writer and service manager, 
it's this: Although the tactics used in each shop differ, "the general 
consensus has always been to sell you as much as possible, with whatever means 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
It's with that in mind that Stevenson has written "Auto Repair Shams and Scams: 
How to Avoid Getting Ripped Off" (Price Stern Sloan; $9.95), an insider's view 
of how the auto repair industry really works. 
</P>
<P>
As Stevenson sees it, "Auto Repair Shams and Scams" is "the crucifix held in 
the face of Dracula auto repair. 
</P>
<P>
"This is dirty laundry being revealed like it never has -- the tactics, the 
lingo, the tricks, the parts and services oversold, the personalities, 
education and attitudes of the staff, and any other area in the auto repair 
industry that has boggled, confused or disheartened you." 
</P>
<P>
Written for the layman, the paperback guidebook covers everything from how to 
protect yourself from unfair charges and repairs to how to deal with mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
In a chapter on choosing the best garage, Stevenson details the advantages and 
disadvantages of having repairs done at service stations and other types of 
automotive repair outlets, along with appropriate cautionary notes: "Many (car) 
dealerships don't do engine machine work. Although they offer this service, it 
can be 'farmed out' to a special facility. . . . The result is a costly charge. 
Your best bet is to find a dealership that has its own in-house machine shop 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
The book also serves as a reference manual, with Stevenson focusing on common 
repair services -- L.O.F. (lube, oil, filter), tires, exhaust systems, brakes, 
the front end, electrical system, tuneups and smog checks -- and showing how 
the job should be done and which parts tend to be oversold. 
</P>
<P>
He concludes with a chapter on tips to save money, and what to do when you've 
been ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
And just how extensive are auto repair rip-offs? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's a terrible problem, probably the worst I've seen in any 
occupation you can think of," Stevenson, 38, said in an interview. "I think 
there's a great wool blanket pulled over the eyes of the American public." 
</P>
<P>
There's no question auto repair is a big business. The owners of America's 181 
million registered cars spend more than $70 billion annually to maintain and 
repair them. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 10-year-old U.S. Department of Transportation study of the auto 
repair industry, about 40% of the costs associated with auto repair are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons include unneeded parts in package deals, faulty repairs, 
unnecessary preventive maintenance, unneeded repairs sold with possible 
fraudulent intent, and accidents due to faulty repairs. 
</P>
<P>
All that adds up to an annual consumer loss of $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Says consumer advocate Ralph Nader in his foreword to "Auto Repair Shams and 
Scams": 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the figure for these consumer losses has increased to approximately $40 
billion a year. There is a little evidence that the auto repair industry has 
cleaned up its act." 
</P>
<P>
The information provided in "Auto Repair Shams and Scams" is, according to 
Nader, "a perfect antidote for the . . . 'take me, I'm yours, attitude.' " 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said several factors prompted him to write the book. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my contention that it's not necessarily a greedy person, it is the way 
most mechanics are paid that determines your bill. Most dealerships and gas 
stations have one thing in common: a bonus and commission system," in which 
mechanics earn extra money on parts and services they sell above a certain 
quota. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is the absolute ruin of the industry and has been so detrimental 
to the customer," said Stevenson. Gas stations notoriously work on a 40-20 
deal, he added, in which the mechanic gets 40% of the labor he sells and 20% of 
the parts. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster they go, the more parts they sell. It's better for them. If 
mechanics were paid a flat, hourly rate everywhere, it would be a different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Both Stevenson and Nader also criticize the use of the Flat Rate Service 
Manual, which provides standard, preset rates for some repairs. A brake job on 
a 1990 Ford Taurus, for example, may be listed as 2.5 hours of labor. But, 
Stevenson said, sophisticated new tools almost always allow a mechanic to do 
the job in about half that time. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson is quick to point out that not all mechanics are dishonest. "There 
are mechanics out there who should be consigned to knighthood; they're great." 
he said. 
</P>

A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;

<P>
A 6-FOOT-3 SENIOR FINDS HE CAN FIT IN DURING STAY IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON SHANKER, Jason Shanker is a senior at Corona del Mar High School and 
an alumnus of the Youth For Understanding program, which annually sends 7,000 
students all over the world. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred American students, 100 Japanese families and one summer. What do 
you get when you put them all together? 
</P>
<P>
A summer full of sushi, Kabuki, Mt. Fuji . . . and humanity. 
</P>
<P>
This summer I experienced all of this as part of the Youth for Understanding 
Japan-U.S. Senate Exchange, a joint project of the U.S. and Japanese 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Straight out of Southern California, I was taken, along with 99 students 
representing every state in the nation, by way of a Washington orientation, to 
Japan, where I spent two months living with a family in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
While in Tokyo, I was allowed to live life as a citizen rather than as a 
tourist. Foreigners often see only the shrines and temples, which are but a 
small part of the real Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The people I met there, the friends I made, and the generosity of my host 
family were more memorable than any of the country's beautiful architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the other U.S. students, I wondered if we ever would be accepted in 
Japan with a culture so different from our own. 
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, the people who presented our orientation in Washington laid 
to rest many apprehensions. But there remained plenty of questions that would 
just have to go unanswered until we arrived in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
As quickly as we had been thrown together, we arrived in Tokyo, and it was time 
to go our separate ways. After a hectic day of touring the city, we met our 
host families. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese lady, apparently recognizing me from my application photo, 
introduced herself in English as my host mother, Yuriko Suzuki. I introduced 
myself in Japanese as her exchange student, but it turned out she spoke English 
fluently. 
</P>
<P>
This was a relief, since my introduction represented about 20% of the Japanese 
I had learned while in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping at the offices of the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest 
newspapers, to visit my host father, Satoshi Suzuki, who works there, my host 
mother and I went home by way of the Tokyo expressways. Having this experience, 
I will never again be frustrated by Orange County's traffic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
After winding through a confusing maze of incredibly narrow side streets and 
alleys, we arrived at our destination -- Setagaya Ward, a suburb of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the Suzukis' house, we were greeted by my host mother's parents, 
the Kojimas, and my host brother, Tsuyoshi, and his friend, Fumito Kitamura. 
</P>
<P>
After a traditional Japanese dinner and some conversation, I went to bed in the 
room I would share for the summer with Tsuyoshi. 
</P>
<P>
The first "culture shock" I received was discovering that Japan is not a 
country designed for people who are 6-foot-3. That did not change the fact, 
however, that I was three inches taller than the 6-foot doorways in my host 
family's home. 
</P>
<P>
Once I had finally recovered from jet lag and had begun to get to know the 
people of Japan, the thing that struck me more than anything else was their 
hospitality and generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and relatives of my host family, as well as total strangers, willingly 
gave of their time and selves to make sure my stay was as pleasant as possible. 
</P>
<P>
More than once I found that my casual reference to some place of interest in 
Tokyo was met by offers to take me there and serve as my guide. 
</P>
<P>
After I had traveled a bit in Tokyo, I was able to ride the trains alone. So, 
armed with my English-Japanese dictionary and having the phrase "Where is . . . 
?" down pat in Japanese, I ventured into the city. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem using this phrase was that I had used it so often, I fooled 
people into believing I spoke their language. 
</P>
<P>
So, rather than being met by a slow response and lots of hand signals, I often 
received lightning-fast answers, which were thorough but completely 
incomprehensible to me. 
</P>
<P>
I merely tried to pick out the first direction I had heard -- either left or 
right -- and head that way in hopes of finding someone else to ask. 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Tokyoites went far out of their way to escort me to my 
destination. Unfortunately, I was never able to return the favor as I was 
hardly a prime candidate for someone to ask directions. 
</P>
<P>
But as my host mother pointed out, this was actually a mistake, since I rarely 
set foot outside the house without four or five maps covering the trains, 
subways, geography and sights of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion I made short trips out of Tokyo with my host family. The most 
exciting was when my host parents, brother and I took the "Bullet Train" to 
Kyoto -- a 600-mile trip that took only three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Kyoto is my host father's birthplace, and it was with great care and pride that 
he showed me the city's beautiful temples and shrines. 
</P>
<P>
One temple, the Golden Pavilion, is actually covered in a layer of pure gold. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, I was convinced by some other Americans in Tokyo to do 
something "really Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Late at night, in the company of several hundred tourists and religious 
pilgrims, we began an ascent of 12,388-foot Mt. Fuji. The idea was to climb 
through the night and watch the sunrise from the summit. But by the time we 
were halfway up, we encountered strong winds and rain. 
</P>
<P>
We persevered in search of the perfect sunrise, but at the top we were greeted 
by more rain and finally a sunrise that was filtered by the cloud-filled sky. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed as we were, the experience left us with vivid memories and great 
souvenirs -- walking sticks emblazoned with the mountain's name and elevation. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer in Japan proved to be the best I've ever experienced. My host 
family, my friends and teachers at Keio High School in Tokyo and all of the 
people I encountered through my travels helped to make it a trip I will not 
soon forget.

HOW SWEET IT IS;

<P>
BEEKEEPERS TALK IN REVERENTIAL TONES ABOUT THEIR CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

lives in Vista.

<P>
Next time you dip a spoon into your honey pot consider this: A single bee will 
only gather enough nectar to make one teaspoon of the syrupy sweetener during a 
short and busy life span -- which can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Honey is a crop produced in a wide variety of locations and climates. In North 
County, coastal areas are better suited to honey production because of the 
abundance of eucalyptus trees, according to Alan Mikolich, vice president of 
the Beekeepers' Assn. of San Diego County. The Department of Agriculture Crop 
Report for last year lists the value of honey production in San Diego County at 
$475,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among North County beekeepers is Salvador Mendoza, a veteran of 20 years in 
apiculture in Mexico who now tends bees at the Peterson Farm in Fallbrook. 
Mendoza speaks of beekeeping in almost reverential tones: "I feel such an 
affection for my bees, that, for me, raising them is not work, it's a labor of 
love." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Mendoza -- his head hidden under a protective veil -- went 
about checking his 12 beehives. He temporarily calmed the bees with a puff of 
smoke from his smoker, and carefully lifted off the top of a hive. "You have to 
concentrate on what you're doing," he said as he gently pulled out a frame 
alive with insects. "The bees sense when you make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Bees understand our moods, they can sense if we're afraid," Mendoza said. The 
bees around him were gathering nectar from eucalyptus trees, and bushes of 
sumac and toyon -- a protected California plant. "Do you know that they even 
recognize me?" he added, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The knowledge that bees are sensitive to a person's mood is shared by Emil 
Stoll, another North County apiculturist. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll began beekeeping as a hobby eight years ago in his back yard. Today, his 
hobby has grown to about 350 hives, with an annual yield of 15,000 to 20,000 
pounds of honey. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll's bees favor mesquite and desert flowers, which bloom year-round in 
Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
For the Stolls, beekeeping is a family affair. On farmers' market days, it 
falls upon Stoll's wife, Mable, and his daughter, Patricia Ann, to help sell 
honey, honeycombs, bee pollen and beeswax candles. 
</P>
<P>
Although honey is a natural product, it is difficult to call it completely 
organic because there is no way to control the honeybees' feeding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest, or Grade A honey is the most popular with American consumers, 
said Mikolich of the Beekeepers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Bee pollen and royal jelly (which purportedly has rejuvenating properties) are 
also prized among connoisseurs of natural foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MORE ON HONEY 
</P>
<P>
Local honey producers include: 
</P>
<P>
Peterson Farm, Fallbrook. 439-6466. (Salvador Mendoza or Andrea Peterson) 
California wildflower honey sold for $2 per pound at the Vista Farmer's Market. 
</P>
<P>
Emil Stoll, Fallbrook. 728-4332. Sells honey, beeswax, and candles at farmers' 
markets in Vista and Del Mar. Mesquite and desert flower honey sells for $1.75 
per pound; $3 for 2 pounds and $4 for 3 pounds.

BEST BET: THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
'INTO THE WOODS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim's fairy tale musical, "Into The Woods," will be performed 
today through Sept. 9 at the Moonlight Amphitheatre in Vista's Brengle Terrace 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The run marks the first in the San Diego area since the play's preview at the 
Old Globe Theatre in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Into the Woods," based on the book by James Lapine, weaves the stories of 15 
characters into a single, multi-sided tale that tells what happens after the 
characters' "happily ever after" endings. 
</P>
<P>
Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel and the 
Baker and his Wife are brought to life in the musical setting. Their wishes 
fulfilled, they find that getting what they wanted is not all it's cracked up 
to be, and they find they were sometimes impelled to lie and steal, blame 
others and make dubious moral decisions. They even consider sacrificing Jack to 
a vengeful giant to make things right again. 
</P>
<P>
The musical is directed by Gary Krinke and choreographed by Ray Limon. 
</P>
<P>
What: "Into The Woods" 
</P>
<P>
Where: Moonlight Amphitheatre, Brengle Terrace Park, 1200 Vale Terrace Drive, 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
When: Gates open at 6:30 p.m. for pre-show picnicking. Show begins at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Picnic-style seating is $10 for adults and $6 for children 16 and 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
Call: 724-2110.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: TARYN'S AT THE TRACK USES HORSE SENSE TO REVAMP 
ITS MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just how close is Taryn's at the Track to the Del Mar race track? 
</P>
<P>
When the breeze blows across the surf and the turf at old Del Mar, the odor of 
stables, hay and horses wafts over Via de la Valle and parks in Taryn's lot. 
It's a bracing reminder of the thrill of purebred horseflesh, even for those 
who have never fidgeted in line at a parimutuel window. 
</P>
<P>
Taryn's opened about two years ago and seems to have learned which way the wind 
blows, because it has revamped a menu that once was on the nouvelle cuisine 
side of the tracks to something more attuned to local tastes. This owes partly 
to the fact that Taryn's discovered that the racing season, rather than 
delivering the goods, can be slow; fearing crowds and traffic, locals often 
avoid the track neighborhoods during the race meeting, while many track patrons 
head directly out of the area after the ninth race. The most important menu 
change would be the addition of a goodly many Italian dishes -- primarily 
pastas and decorator pizzas -- since just about anything prepared in the 
Italian way seems an easy sell at present. 
</P>
<P>
It remains a very attractive restaurant, half-lit after sunset so that the 
pinks in the decor seem to continue that event long after the sun has fled. 
Handsome, potted cactus arrangements add sophistication and hint at a 
Southwestern flavor no longer espoused by the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The starter list is not enormously inspiring, although there is some variety, 
with a Thai chicken satay and steamed mussels in marinara sauce interspersed 
among the listings for garlic bread, shrimp cocktail and oysters on the half 
shell. One of the more pleasant treats is a lagniappe, a puddle of virgin olive 
oil infused with garlic and fresh basil that the waitress pours on the butter 
plates as a sop for the bread basket's excellent offerings. 
</P>
<P>
An Oriental-style spinach salad takes a rather novel tack by adorning the 
leaves with mixed sweet peppers, scallions and a moistening of rice wine 
vinaigrette. The Caesar includes -- on request -- a small school of anchovies, 
but is more a decent romaine salad than a genuine Caesar, since the bite simply 
isn't there. However, there is plenty of bite to the thyme-spiked Manhattan 
clam chowder, a hybrid version that combines the thickness of creamy New 
England chowder with the tomatoes that characterize the New Yorker version. 
It's an excellent soup, notable for its full flavor and generous complement of 
tender clams. 
</P>
<P>
The menu makes some effort to cater to the diet-conscious by offering light 
dishes marked with calorie counts (angel hair pasta in fresh tomato sauce at 
280 calories, baked halibut flavored with lemon and dill at 550) and even 
extends this to the pizza section, which includes a pie dressed with a little 
cheese and a lot of vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Further afield in the pizza section is the Cajun prime rib pizza, a round of 
dough topped with something called "Cajun" mozzarella and spicy strips of prime 
rib. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta choices include penne with creamed smoked salmon, linguine with 
assorted fish and shellfish in tomato sauce, and cheese and spinach ravioli in 
a light basil cream with sun-dried tomatoes. Among the more interesting entrees 
are charbroiled swordfish in Champagne sauce; a chicken breast finished with a 
cross-cultural sauce of shiitake mushrooms and Marsala wine, and a top sirloin 
in wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Coconut shrimp have become quite a local favorite, and Taryn's serves an 
excellent, very generously portioned plate of beautifully crisp, juicy prawns; 
the accompanying sauce is remarkably sweet, but appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The "peppercorn" New York sirloin works less well, however, since the marinade 
-- an unusual addition to the typical recipe -- gives the meat a rather musky 
flavor. The steak also seemed dry, and the thick sauce a little too winey and 
cloying. People who like potatoes mashed with their skins will be pleased by 
Taryn's fluffy, well-seasoned spuds, but be warned that the skins lend a 
distracting and disagreeable graininess.

BLACK SHEEP BISTRO HAS WORLD-CLASS WINES AND A FIRED-UP MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I asked Rick Boufford about his extraordinary wine list, he opened up like 
a sunflower in July. 
</P>
<P>
Boufford is the proprietor of Tustin's Black Sheep Bistro, a sweet little 
storefront restaurant that is just full of surprises. Wine is his passion, and 
it shows -- the restaurant is a paradise for wine lovers. If Boufford has a 
great wine to match every dish he serves, it's because he has been collecting 
wines for 18 years, about half his life. 
</P>
<P>
There are wines on his list from nearly every famous producer in Europe. "This 
wine," he said, referring to a '78 Barbaresco from Angelo Gaja that he 
personally decanted at the table, "has been in my cellar at 60 degrees for over 
11 years, since its release." Finding a wine this sought-after in a 
neighborhood restaurant is rare enough, but having it served properly after 
years of impeccable care comes as a shock. Very few restaurants anywhere handle 
wine with half Boufford's seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
He takes cooking seriously, too, as he happens to be the chef. He cooked at the 
Hobbit for 11 years and worked with Alan Greeley at the Golden Truffle, two 
restaurants where a chef can do almost anything that strikes his fancy. The 
style he developed from his tenure at these restaurants could best be described 
as Mediterranean: heavy on garlic, herbs and olive oil. His menu is simple and 
rustic, full of farmhouse dishes from the south of France and the north of 
Italy. Nearly all his food complements wine from Piedmont, Burgundy or one of 
the other great wine regions nearby. 
</P>
<P>
You get the sneaking suspicion that he has opened a restaurant just to create a 
vehicle for wine appreciation. You might be right. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Diana, bought the place last year and retained its cozy, rural 
appeal. There are wooden farmhouse chairs, robin's-egg tablecloths and framed 
scenes depicting life in the slow lane of rural France. The two dining areas 
are separated by a tiled wine bar, the larger (and invariably more crowded) 
room being for nonsmokers. An eclectic blend of New Age and classical music 
plays softly in the background. It's a comforting place to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
The minute you are seated, Diana, the unofficial maitre d', brings a dish of 
the restaurant's home-cured olives, the Nicoise variety. They come swimming in 
a marinade thick with thyme, oregano and minced garlic, and are dangerously 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a grainy pate maison, some tiny, can't-miss mussels in saffron caper 
sauce, garlicky escargots a la Bourguignonne or something the chef calls Black 
Sheep tri-shrimp: three large shrimp with aioli (garlic mayonnaise), rouille (a 
similar suspension livened up with red pepper and spices), and a pale green 
sauce made with pureed cilantro. There are often special appetizers, such as 
the succulent fresh foie gras with raspberry sauce that I tried. If that is 
available, Boufford has several Sauternes and Alsatian Gewurztraminers to match 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The main courses are mostly flame-broiled meats, grain-fed lamb, New York 
steak, duck breast and chicken breast. These meats are served with a choice of 
oil-based sauces, pesto, herb garlic and Provencal, the last being the herb 
garlic dressing with thyme and olive added to it. They're OK. 
</P>
<P>
The thing to watch for, though, is the daily special, often a classic regional 
French dish such as bourride, cassoulet or choucroute. These are the best 
things to eat here, and Boufford adheres to the authentic recipes as closely as 
he possibly can. And frankly, his cooking seems to be better when he's not 
wandering off on his own. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Boufford is featuring maigret de canard, specially fattened duck 
breast that he gets from Ariane Daguin, daughter of Andre Daguin, one of 
Gascony's most celebrated chefs. This maigret comes from New Jersey, and it is 
one of the best products you can buy. I urge you to try it, for its exceptional 
richness and depth of flavor. There is a whirlwind of good Bordeaux and 
California Cabernets on the wine list to enjoy with it. 
</P>
<P>
Another off-menu dish you'll want to try is one almost always on hand, confit 
de canard. This is duck preserved in its own fat, and the chef prepares it by 
the bucket. It sounds richer than it is, actually. When cooked, the fat is 
usually steamed or sauteed off, leaving a complex, slightly stringy meat. 
</P>
<P>
Boufford serves his confit on a bed of pasta, as if France and Italy had 
magically become one country. On the back of the menu, it happens, there is a 
map of the two countries, along with a reference to the "ancient mystical 
country of Francaly." An appealing fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert is not a strong point at this restaurant, but the kitchen makes an 
honest effort to please. There is a handsome cheese board with Laura Chenel 
chevre, St. An dre and a runny Brie, among others, plus a fine flourless 
chocolate torte and a solid pear tart with homemade creme fraizche. The others, 
I regret to say, are not worth consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you could have more wine to end the meal -- a vintage port, 
say, or something from the extensive list of dessert wines. The prices for all 
wines, incidentally, are more than reasonable. To give an example, Ric Forman's 
Cabernet is $60 at one of the hotter local restaurants but only $40 here. If 
$40 seems steep, there are dozens of wines here under $25 you will be delighted 
to drink. And if money is truly no object, how about a '61 Chateau d'Yquem for 
$600, or a private tasting of Domaine de la Romanee Conti for $1,500? 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen hundred dollars. That's serious money. Boufford, it's obvious, is not 
kidding around. 
</P>
<P>
Black Sheep Bistro is moderately priced. Appetizers are $6 to $8. Pastas are 
$12 to $17. Main courses are $14 to $23.

PUT AWAY THE GRILL -- THESE PAMPERED PORKERS ARE PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're short and black, weigh less than 100 pounds, and they've got round 
little bellies that hang almost to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
They're Vietnamese potbellied pigs, and they're about to be granted legal 
status in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Like most cities, Monterey Park bans all types of swine, as well as cows, sheep 
and other farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials have decided the law is hogwash when it comes to potbellied 
pigs, which are smaller and more unobtrusive than their pink, much-larger 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
So, the City Council on Monday unanimously gave preliminary approval for 
residents to keep the miniature pigs as pets, one per household. The council is 
scheduled to take a final vote on the proposed law Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Council members were adamant about keeping the door closed to all other 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
"Hogs will not be permitted," Councilwoman Marie Purvis said. "Please don't run 
out and buy a hog." 
</P>
<P>
Known scientifically as Sus scrofa bittatus, the Vietnamese potbellied pig 
ranges from 30 to 90 pounds -- about as big as a medium- or large-sized dog -- 
and can be housebroken, Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said. 
</P>
<P>
Strait consulted with local animal control officials before recommending that 
the law be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new fad to have miniature pigs as pets," Strait said. "They're very 
cute. You can keep them in the yard like a dog, train them just like a dog. You 
can teach them to come. They're supposed to be smarter than dogs." 
</P>
<P>
They're also very expensive: $1,500 for a male, $5,000 for a female, Strait 
said. "It's not the kind of thing you'd just barbecue and eat," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Arnold, a 1-year-old potbellied porker who lives at the Monterey Park 
home of Sally McComb, sister of Fire Chief Allen E. McComb. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's favorite pastimes are splashing in a portable pool on a hot summer 
day, snuggling under his electric blanket when it's cold, and eating grapes and 
dog food, Fire Chief McComb said. 
</P>
<P>
He even shares a doggy door with the McCombs' German shepherd, Gretchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnold has become attached to me," he said. "The pig, my nephew and myself 
celebrated our birthdays together."

THEATER REVIEW: 'BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS'; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S ANY FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
A YEAR MAY BE TOO LONG TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER IN NEIL SIMON'S 'BB' 
TRILOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Set in Brooklyn in 1937, "Brighton Beach Memoirs" is the first installment of 
Neil Simon's autobiographical "BB" trilogy, followed by "Biloxi Blues" and 
"Broadway Bound." 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Players are planning to produce all three, one per year. That's a 
fine idea but may put pressure on the company's audience. The production of 
"Brighton Beach Memoirs" that opened last week is so inviting that many will 
find a year's wait for the next chapter to be a year too long. 
</P>
<P>
The entire play takes place during two nights, a week apart, in and directly 
outside of the home shared by the extended Jerome family. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene, the younger brother, is the central character and Simon's idealization 
of himself: a Yankees fan who'd like to become a professional baseball player 
but whose second choice would be a career as a writer. And, just in case, he's 
already preparing his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
When first produced in 1983, "Brighton Beach Memoirs" was cited as a sign of a 
newly mature Simon, a bit deeper than his previous successes, which, critics 
would have it, were little more than patchworks of gags. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever relative depth the play might have, there's no more than a momentary 
pause from laughter, often provoked by the wisecracking Eugene, either in 
conversation with his family or commenting on the action, directly to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
And there's plenty to comment on. We're eavesdropping on the family during a 
particularly difficult period of their life. Times everywhere are hard, and the 
world's readying itself for World War II. Longstanding pressures between 
sisters Kate and Blanche are building to a climax. Father Jack is working too 
hard. Brother Stanley is having problems at work. Young cousin Laurie is 
suffering from some undefined illness. And 15-year-old Eugene and his slightly 
older cousin, Nora, are on the threshold of adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Everything's resolved by the final curtain, and there isn't much chance that it 
won't be. The play's appeal is in watching the gears mesh. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it looks great. Set designer Darrell Gustafson and a huge crew 
have come up with a two-story house for the Jeromes, so perfect (seen in 
cutaway) that we wouldn't be surprised if water ran in the sinks and the 
toilets flushed. Crystal St. Roman's costumes are functional, though in some 
cases perhaps a bit too modern. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Berg directs with a sure hand for the material, and the lighting 
(designed by Dick Johnson, operated by Jeff Calnitz) is especially effective. 
</P>
<P>
As for the acting, "Brighton Beach Memoirs" is a star vehicle. It launched the 
career of Matthew Broderick, who created the role of Eugene. David Gautschy, a 
UC Santa Barbara theater major, walks away with this production. He seems to 
have been born to play the sharp-tongued, confused but optimistic Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
Standouts among the supporting cast include Leonore Gabel as Eugene's mother, 
Jeannine Marquie as his insufferable younger cousin, and Arnold Fadden as the 
father who's somehow able to keep everything together. 
</P>
<P>
Commendably, both the writing and acting underplay or avoid most conventional 
Jewish stereotypes. This could be any family. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Brighton Beach Memoirs" plays at 8:30 p.m. Thursday through 
Saturday through Sept. 29 at the Conejo Players Theater, 351 S. Moorpark Road, 
Thousand Oaks. General admission is $8 on Thursdays and $10 on Fridays and 
Saturdays, with a $1 discount for seniors and children 12 and under. For 
reservations, which are essential, or further information call (805) 495-3715.

TWO LEGENDS, B.B. KING AND JERRY LEE LEWIS, ARE COMING TO VENTURA. BUT IT WON'T 
BE CHEAP.

<P>
Local rock fans who aren't in the Fortune 500 may have to consider a second job 
if they want to continue attending the seemingly never-ending lineup of famous 
rockers coming to our area. Rock 'n' roll can be an expensive hobby, but hey, 
sometimes you've got to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the venerable Ventura Theatre presented Ray Charles, and this weekend 
-- get those piggy banks ready -- two more rock 'n' roll hall of famers will 
stop by: B. B. King and Jerry Lee Lewis. Each will play two shows at 8 p.m. and 
10:30 p.m., King on Friday and Lewis on Saturday. Tickets are $22.50. So if you 
take a date, have a drink, eat dinner and buy a shirt, just remember McDonald's 
is usually hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Riley B. King must live out of a suitcase; it seems he has been on tour since 
Moses went on tour. King averages more than 250 shows a year. This will be at 
least his third appearance at the Ventura Theatre. The line will stretch around 
the corner onto Main Street. People like the blues. In fact, King is credited 
with introducing the blues to white America in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1925 in Itta Bene in the Mississippi Delta, King grew up playing on 
street corners for dimes. With $2.50 in his pocket he hitchhiked to Memphis in 
the late '40s and got his first big break performing on Sonny Boy Williamson's 
radio show on WDIA. He became known as The Beale Sreet Blues Boy, which he 
later shortened to B.B. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, King had his first major hit, "Three O'Clock Blues," which hit No. 1 
on the R&amp;B charts. In 1952, he had another chart topper with "You Don't 
Know Me." More hits followed such as "Please Love Me" and "You Upset Me Baby" 
which launched King into nationwide touring. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'50s, King was performing at a dive in Arkansas when a couple of the 
patrons had too much fun (after too many beers), got into a fight and knocked 
over a kerosene stove. The place caught fire. After rushing to safety outside, 
King noticed that his $30 guitar was still inside. He sped back in and grabbed 
his guitar, narrowly escaping with his life. Later, King learned the fight was 
over a woman named Lucille, and he named his guitar, and each subsequent 
guitar, Lucille. No more $30 guitars, you can bet. 
</P>
<P>
During the British Invasion of the mid-'60s, guitarists such as Eric Clapton, 
George Harrison and Jeff Beck were inspired by King's technique. King performed 
at the Newport Folk Festival, at the Fillmore West, often sharing the bill with 
young rock bands and thus converting their young white fans. In 1969, King 
opened for the Rolling Stones on their tour. The next year, King scored his 
biggest hit with "The Thrill Is Gone." 
</P>
<P>
Five Grammys followed, plus a spot in the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame (1984) 
and the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame (1986). Colleges across American have given 
him more degrees than a thermometer in Bakersfield. The thrill, apparently, 
still is there for B. B. and Lucille. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lee Lewis, a.k.a. The Killer, is one of rock's original bad boys, but he 
is no more of a "boy" than the Beach Boys. But he still tours constantly and 
plays the piano with sufficient abandon to suggest his shoes may be on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Performing professionally since he was 15, Lewis developed a frantic style, 
which incorporated country swing, rural blues, R&amp;B and swamp rock. In 1956, 
Lewis became one of the original rockers to sign with Sun Records in Memphis. 
His swaggering persona and lustful aura seemed to define rock 'n' roll as the 
devil's music in the '50s. Marrying his 14-year-old cousin in 1958 didn't help 
Lewis' image. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis had only three Top 10 rock hits (all in the '50s) but his reputation for 
wild live shows far outstripped his ability to churn out hits. In the late '60s 
and early '70s, Lewis became a country singer, scoring a dozen Top 10 hits. His 
career has had more ups and downs than the Dodger bullpen, but he does things 
to a piano (everything short of spontaneous combustion) that leave fans shaking 
their heads and tapping their feet. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Hollywood made a film of The Killer's life, "Great Balls of Fire." 
The controversy surrounding the film should not have happened. The film's star, 
Dennis Quaid, wanted to do Lewis' songs himself. Lewis ended up doing his own 
songs, much as he will at the Ventura Theatre.

THE CONEJO VALLEY RINK PROVIDES FAMILY FUN AS WELL AS INSTRUCTION IN FIGURE 
EIGHTS AND HOCKEY.

At mid-morning, it was 80 degrees outside, but inside the Conejo Valley Ice 
Skating Center, it was barely 40 degrees. Mothers in long, down-filled coats 
huddled on bleachers to watch their children move on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the kids had been at the Newbury Park rink since 6 a.m. Half a dozen 
instructors were giving private lessons to competitors, some as young as 7. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Ventura County's only ice skating rink -- one of a dwindling supply 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It's a no-frills place in a converted grocery store, tucked into a shopping 
mall. Yet, it's a hub for serious skaters, both hockey and figure, and it is 
the only spot around for public skating. It's home to the Conejo Valley Figure 
Skating Club and a home away from home for many of the club's competitively 
minded skaters. 
</P>
<P>
"We focus on youth training," said Sean McGillivray, president of Ice Time 
Unlimited, a group that owns the rink. "We have a number of serious competitors 
who train four or five hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks who was on the ice for a lesson 
with her coaches during the freestyle session that morning. At 16, she placed 
eighth during the U.S. National Figure Skating Championship last February in 
Salt Lake City. As a junior the year before, she placed third. 
</P>
<P>
She's one of the few young people in the country who can do a triple jump, 
McGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
Tisha, already an international competitor, has her sights set on the 1992 
Olympics. She's been skating since she was 4. She's at the rink by 6 a.m. for 
her daily workout. 
</P>
<P>
"None of it is easy. It takes a lot of work getting your jumps consistent and 
getting a finished look," Tisha said during a break. To accommodate her 
skating, she attends Thousand Oaks High School part time and does 
correspondence courses at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tisha's first skating instruction was at the rink's skating school, which is 
headed by Terry Tonius. The school offers an eight-week semester of classes for 
$78. That includes a half-hour group lesson each week and 20 practice sessions, 
and two guest passes. The children start as young as 4 and progress through a 
series of levels, learning both figures and freestyle skating. 
</P>
<P>
At any one time, the school has about 300 students. On a Saturday, there might 
be 30 to 60 kids on the ice at a time for lessons. Those who want to compete go 
on to private instruction, which runs $16 to $25 a half-hour, Tonius said. The 
school employs 16 instructors who also free-lance as private instructors for 
aspiring skaters. 
</P>
<P>
For young skaters not interested in freestyle or figure skating, the rink also 
has a drill team for competition precision skating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the kids who do other things in their lives and don't have the 
time to make quite the commitment," Tonius said. 
</P>
<P>
The rink also is a hockey hub. The youth hockey program there includes 225 kids 
on 16 teams, all of which play each other. There is a beginners' hockey program 
where they can learn the fundamentals of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Adults play as well. At least 300 -- including a 72-year-old man -- compete on 
22 teams making up four divisions. 
</P>
<P>
McGillivray has been with the rink since it moved into the converted grocery 
store 14 years ago. He said plans to build a new rink are in the formative 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't designed to be a rink," he said. "It's not energy-efficient." Over 
the years, the rink has had its financial problems -- including rising rent and 
insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, we were within days of closing down," he said. "We fought to 
keep it open." 
</P>
<P>
It's a familiar story at other rinks that face the same money problems. "There 
is a tremendous shortage of rinks," he said. "Ten rinks have closed in Southern 
California, including one in Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center is on sure footing, although the 
ownership of the building changed recently. The rink may not have the dressing 
rooms and other perks that McGillivray envisions in a new rink, but he said it 
has the essential ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very good ice." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: The Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center is located at 510 N. 
Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park, just north of the Ventura Freeway. Winter 
public skating hours after Labor Day are noon to 2:45 p.m. Monday and

RALPH HOLT SAYS COMIC BOOKS AREN'T JUST KIDS' STUFF WHEN IT COMES TO READERSHIP

Captain America hit The Red Skull hard enough to kill his whole wretched 
family. But it didn't. So Captain America beat on him some more. But what's 
this? Here comes The Red Skull's mindless minions to defend their boss. 
</P>
<P>
Even Captain America, tough enough to knock Mike Tyson into next week, sees the 
situation is hopeless, so he snags The Red Skull's personal jet plane and 
high-tails it off to Skull Island, narrowly avoiding his untimely demise. 
</P>
<P>
But what's that thing in The Red Skull's gloved hand? It looks like a 
detonator, and The Red Skull is laughing hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain America believes he has won. But little did he know that during the 
heat of battle I managed to tape a miniature A-bomb to the back of his neck!" 
</P>
<P>
As Captain America streaks away, The Red Skull begins to press the detonator 
with his thumb only to find that -- the story is CONTINUED UNTIL NEXT MONTH!!! 
What's going to happen? Who knows? Comic books are like that. 
</P>
<P>
Superhero comics generally have two major character types: villains who want to 
rule the world and heroes who want to save it. And they invariably end with 
some cliffhanger situation, which it's hoped will cause the reader to purchase 
the next issue. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph's Comic Corner in Ventura is the one-stop shop for collectors eager to 
find out that Captain America got out of it -- again. Ralph Holt, 36, an 
incorrigible Giants/A's/Niners fan, has been selling comics in Ventura for 10 
years. Comics don't cost a dime anymore -- the average price is $1.25 and up. 
And up. The comic book business is big business. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I just found myself on the other side of the counter," said Holt, much 
smaller than the mighty Thor. "I used to read a lot as a kid, but my parents 
didn't think comic books were very respectable. I had a lot of early '60s 
Marvels; just about everything from Fantastic Four 2 (second edition) on up -- 
about $20,000 worth of comics by today's prices. I ended up trading them for 
postage stamps." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until his college days that Holt began getting serious about 
comics. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved from the Bay Area in 1972 to go to UCSB. I was a chemistry major. I 
lived in an apartment in Isla Vista with a couple of roommates. Anyway, one 
day, I looked in the mirror and I asked myself if I wanted to be behind a test 
tube all my life and the guy in the mirror said, 'nope.' 
</P>
<P>
"My roommate at the time had a bunch of comics, DCs mostly. And I started 
reading them, stuff like Mister Miracle and The New Gods -- I'd never been 
exposed to DCs before -- I was a hard-core Marvel fan. Stuff like Superman 
really made me a DC fan -- I ended up buying my roommate's comics for a dime 
apiece. And I started buying every Marvel title too." 
</P>
<P>
Ten or 15 years ago, there were very few comic book shops, and none in Ventura 
County. Getting all the comics for a given month amounted to a road trip from 
Stop N' Go to drug stores to liquor stores because a single store seldom had 
all the comics. Distribution was hit or miss, at best. But on the good side, 
comics cost 15 cents, and later a quarter off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there weren't any comic shops in Santa Barbara, I found myself going to 
the Cherokee Book Store in Hollywood every couple of months to get back issues. 
For some reason, the people at the store thought I was somebody else, so they 
used to give me all these half-price deals. I used to spend a hundred bucks or 
so; and back then, you could get a lot of comics for a hundred bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Holt was working as a gardener in those days and making the comic convention 
circuit on weekends. At one convention, he met a guy named Dave Debovis from 
Santa Barbara. "We sort of hit it off," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was then that I went from being just a collector to a seller. We joined 
forces and started doing the convention circuit around California. And the 
prices of comics were just starting to jump." 
</P>
<P>
When there wasn't a convention happening, Holt and Debovis would sell comics at 
the Santa Barbara swap meet, and, he said, gradually began to build a clientele 
because there were no comic shops in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
And Holt and Debovis would have the comics sent by UPS directly from the 
wholesaler. "This gave us a month's jump on the stores, and we did pretty well. 
One thing led to another and it came down to, 'Hey, let's open a store.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 they opened the The Andromeda Book Shop in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold comics, but also science fiction books and baseball cards. We did OK, 
not great because there weren't enough comic collectors and comics weren't that 
expensive then. You had to sell a lot of 50-cent comics. It's a lot different 
now: there are $4.95 comics, posters, books and T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
But the two entrepreneurs quickly found out that they got along only slightly 
better than Captain America and The Red Skull. They parted company in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"He got the store, and I got most of my comics," Holt said. "I had a great 
summer; I lived at the beach. I squandered all my money, but I had a great tan 
and lots of comics. My roommate was going nuts, there was no room in the 
apartment -- there were comics piled up everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
So he opened a store in Ventura basically, he said, because there was no room 
at home for all his comics. 
</P>
<P>
"My shop was located inside this junk store called Our Stoar (now Bonnie's) 
across from The Top Hat on Main Street. The rent was only $60 per month, and I 
was only open three days a week because I had a small landscape maintenance 
business on the side. The comic business kept getting better and better 
however, and in a few months I doubled my space for $100 per month." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph's Comics Corner was only slightly bigger than The Red Skull's heart. 
Three people in the store was about as cozy as you, William Conrad and Shelly 
Winters in a Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a hundred-dollar day, it was something to shout about. But I had to 
close by 4:30 p.m. every day because that's when the store closed. So I moved 
into my own store, which I did in 1982 -- on Main Street down from Seaward, not 
far from Ventura High School." Last month, he moved across the street to a 
bigger store. 
</P>
<P>
"Now a large percentage of people who read and collect comics are adults. First 
Comics did a survey last year and discovered that the average age of their 
readers was 25 -- that blew their mind. It's not just the superhero stuff that 
people buy anymore, but more adult comics such as Nexus, The Badger and 
Japanese comics such as Akira are real hot right now." 
</P>
<P>
"There's over 300 different comic titles issued each month, many of them cost 
about two bucks each. It's never too late to start collecting comics, but it's 
too late to start collecting everything, unless you're rich." 
</P>
<P>
Probably only The Red Skull could afford to collect all comics, but he's too 
beat up to push those automated teller buttons. 
</P>
<P>

As military activity in the Mideast gradually escalates, so does business at 
American Eagle Flags and Banners in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me, 'I'm going to fly the flag until this mess is over,' " 
co-owner Frances Harwood said. "One woman said her son-in-law was called to 
action and she would fly it until he got back." 
</P>
<P>
What have been the fastest selling flags recently? "Marine flags," Harwood 
said. "I sold out, reordered and sold out again. People are seeing more Marine 
flags with the boys over there. I usually sell about one every three months, 
but I've sold 12 in the last two weeks."

Congratulations to Ventura's Joseph Harper, who just returned from the national 
canoe championships in Indianapolis with four gold medals and one silver medal. 
Ventura Olympic canoe and kayak teammate Jim Werland picked up two golds and 
another member, Mark Collitch, won the all-around points competition. 
</P>
<P>
And a belated congrats to Norman Pollak of Westlake, he of the iron stomach. 
Earlier this month, Pollak won his Optimist Club's annual pie-eating contest. 
According to his good friend and publicist Lynn Richards, "He won because he 
was the only one who didn't get sick." 
</P>
<P>
Always a sign of good eating.

Ever since the motion picture came out, Dick Tracy's silhouette and machine gun 
have been plastered everywhere. Who do we have to thank for this? In large 
part, Camarillo artist Jonny Kwan, who had a hand in most of the design work 
involving the movie logos and posters. 
</P>
<P>
While working on the project, Kwan had a chance to meet some of the stars in 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty: "He had control over everything. He had a lot of power, but he 
has good taste," Kwan said. "Working with him was really nice. He has an air 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino: "Pacino was sitting two chairs away from me; I didn't know who it 
was until Warren Beatty said, 'Big Al, how are you doing?' I just thought he 
was an old man because of his makeup." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna: "She looked at a drawing and said it was a little too dark. That was 
her response. I didn't pay too much attention to it. Meeting her was a 
memorable experience, but she was dressed up very plain. She was very ordinary 
at the time. Everything is makeup and lighting." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone notice the hand-drawn sign on Valentine Road that reads "Recycling 
Center" and has an arrow that looks like it's pointing to the Ivy Lawn 
cemetery? 
</P>
<P>
As you may be aware, September has been designated National Piano Month by none 
other than the National Piano Foundation. (Of course, it's also National 
Cholesterol Education Month, National Honey Month and National Courtesy Month, 
but we have limited space.) 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the keyboard, we spoke to Dorothy Schecter, a 20-year veteran of 
teaching piano and a piano professor at Cal Lutheran University, to find out 
how instruction in the '90s compares to that of years past. 
</P>
<P>
Number of students: Schecter has noticed wide fluctuation. "Ten years ago, I 
noticed a drop off, possibly attributed to the lessening of the arts in the 
public schools," she said. "But in the last two years, I've seen an upswing. 
Enrollment in private lessons and classes at Cal Lutheran has almost tripled." 
She partially attributes the increase to computerized instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassing moments: Whether past or present, horror stories are a given. "One 
time I told my students to dress nicely for a recital, but not to be drab. One 
student wore a black dress and the hottest pink shoes . . . they blinded the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Schecter also vividly remembers a particularly awkward moment of her own. "I 
remember playing a piece and having two of the keys fly off in my face." LEO 
SMITH

WITH 12 CLUBS AND MORE THAN 1,000 MEMBERS, THE COUNTY IS A HOTBED OF SQUARE 
DANCING.

<P>
Seniors, want to expand your social life? Bored with walking laps at the mall? 
You can't beat square dancing for inexpensive, fun exercise. With 12 clubs 
totaling more than 1,000 members, Ventura County is a hotbed of square dancing. 
In fact, square dancing is the official folk dance of California, according to 
Roy Northup of Ventura, president of Bachelors 'N Bachelorettes. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm single," you say, "and I don't know how to square dance." 
</P>
<P>
No problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bachelors 'N Bachelorettes, an international singles square dance club, has 
chapters in Ventura and Thousand Oaks. BNBs, as it's called, also accepts 
couples, but it is designed for single dancers -- those who arrive without a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a divorce 13 years ago and didn't know what I was going to do," said 
Margaret Westendorf, who is in her early 50s. "A friend suggested square 
dancing. I'm still single, still dancing and having a great time." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining clubs will try to help you find a dance partner during the first 
two to three weeks of lessons. After that, however, you must bring your own to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Dance partners John Eslick and Irma Hambly graduated from the Conejo Thumpers 
class three years ago. According to Eslick, some couples clubs such as the "Pi 
R Squares" accept singles and try to help them find a partner. Hambly said, 
"That's because most widows and widowers don't look upon themselves as single. 
They just don't have a partner." 
</P>
<P>
Early in September, all the county clubs will begin weekly square dance classes 
that continue for nine months. Clubs meet on different nights, which allows 
visitation between groups and makes it possible for people such as 20-year-old 
Steve Avery to belong to clubs in four cities. 
</P>
<P>
Avery completed classes last year. "There are quite a few retired people 
involved," he said. In fact, more than half of the county's club members are 
over 55. The rest are in their 30s and 40s. 
</P>
<P>
If your working knowledge of square dancing stems from fifth-grade P.E., as 
mine does, let's learn together: 
</P>
<P>
"Sets" or squares of eight dancers perform a series of steps according to the 
"caller," who sings instructions, tells jokes and entertains the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
After six months of lessons, "mainstream level" dancers know the first 40 calls 
or dance moves in the Dictionary of Square Dance Calls and Moves, including the 
familiar "promenade" and "do-si-do." Graduates of the standard nine-month 
classes reach "plus level." With about 74 moves under their belts, they can 
perform complex moves such as "relay the deucey," which is done to 48 musical 
beats. 
</P>
<P>
To keep things interesting, clubs also hold special dance events. A mystery bus 
trip recently took BNBs to a club in Orange County. Westendorf, president of 
the Thousand Oaks BNB, said members keep on learning at "quarterly dances" held 
by all the clubs. Four times a year, California's 22,000 square dancers learn a 
new "tip" or call. 
</P>
<P>
It costs about $3 to dance the night away. But in other ways square dancing is 
big business. Besides specially designed club name tags, most people buy 
"swingers." These collections of badges that swing beneath the name plate on 
small chains indicate past and current club offices held, and other clubs 
visited throughout the world. According to caller Darren Gallina, people square 
dance all over the world. Even in Japan, the calls are in English. 
</P>
<P>
For hard-core enthusiasts there are newsletters, Windbreaker jackets and even 
RV square dance clubs. Many attend square dance conventions where they can buy 
gag-tags with nicknames or slogans, license plate frames, car decals and dance 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, most people purchase their wardrobe from square dance apparel 
shops. Women wear colorful, fitted dresses with short, full skirts and puffed 
sleeves. Many prefer dance shoes with a wide, pump heel and an ankle strap to 
keep them in place. Men often sport cowboy boots and a string tie or 
neckerchief over a fitted Western shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalie Fitch is a single member of two clubs in Oxnard and Ventura. At 59, she 
has been dancing for two years. "I'm proud that I'm in condition to still do 
it." Her two granddaughters, ages 10 and 11, have also completed the classes. 
"They'll call me up and ask, 'Nana, you goin' square dancing tonight?' " 
</P>
<P>
Fitch picks them up, and away they "do-si-do."

REBUILDING CAL LUTHERAN MUST RELY -- FOR NOW -- ON ITS DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
For Cal Lutheran the best offense might be a good defense. 
</P>
<P>
New Cal Lutheran Coach Joe Harper has inherited a football squad with a defense 
that has remained somewhat intact since last season and an offense that has 
sustained heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
Only four starters return on offense, and everyone who carried the ball, except 
perhaps a manager or two, has departed. 
</P>
<P>
In one area, though, Cal Lutheran (3-6 in '89) has achieved addition by 
subtraction, dropping Cal State Northridge -- which had won the past seven 
games between the schools -- from the schedule. The Kingsmen have added 
Division III teams Whittier and Claremont-Mudd and Division II San Francisco 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tenderized schedule, Harper describes himself as "very 
apprehensive" entering the season. 
</P>
<P>
At least in the early going, the defense will have to hold the fort for a team 
that will be considerably less offensive than an Andrew Dice Clay joke. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect (the defense) to do well while we're getting our act together," 
senior tight end and co-captain Dave Deisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Lutheran, a California condor would be easier to find than an 
experienced offensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Leading rusher Craig Ashley, who ripped Cal State Northridge for 151 yards and 
three touchdowns as a freshman last season, has dropped off the team, and 
Harper is looking to freshman Brian Kane (5-foot-10, 170) to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Kane, a transfer from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a former Oak Park High star, 
spent the spring with the Kingsmen track team but has four years of football 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback is more than a question mark; it's an interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
The four quarterbacks from last season, all underclassmen, have left the team. 
The leading returning passer is linebacker Cary Caulfield, who completed one 
pass for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Feliciano Ramirez (5-11, 175) and Javier Ramirez (5-9, 185), are 
expected to compete for the quarterback position, and Harper plans to ease 
their development by keeping the offense basic. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to kind of go at the pace that they can assimilate the material," 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
The receiving corps is probably Cal Lutheran's strongest offensive unit. 
Deisinger (6-6, 235) is a two-year starter who caught 18 passes last season. 
</P>
<P>
Junior wideout Tom Leogrande (6-0, 163), a big-play receiver, caught 11 passes 
(24.7-yard average), three for touchdowns. Sophomore Len Bradley (5-11, 175) 
caught three passes and also punted, averaging 38.7 yards a kick. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters Mike Pezonella, a 5-10, 260-pound junior guard, and John 
Milam, a 5-11, 255-pound senior tackle, lead an offensive line that lost four 
players who started frequently last season. Senior co-captain Dana Zupke (5-11, 
195) will shore up the line after moving from defensive line to center. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel will dictate the offense, but the playbook likely will include more 
play-action passes and shorter routes than it did last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure things will click," Deisinger said. "It's going to be new for 
everybody so it doesn't matter that we don't have a lot of returnees." 
</P>
<P>
The defense has more continuity than the offense. Kyle Tarpenning returns as 
defensive coordinator and welcomes back several players who played extensively. 
</P>
<P>
The basic 3-4 system reportedly will stay the same, but emphasis will be placed 
on pressuring the opposing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's primary strength is the secondary, with three veteran starters. 
The linebacker corps also boasts a few good men. 
</P>
<P>
Junior inside linebacker Caulfield (6-0, 236) and senior safety Nicko Rising 
(6-1, 190) hit like they're wearing lead shoulder pads. Caulfield and Rising 
had 84 and 59 tackles, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Kevin Evans, a 6-0, 195-pound junior, returns as the 
second-leading tackler from a year ago with 67, including eight for losses, and 
he also had two interceptions. Senior Mark Staley (5-9, 183) started at 
cornerback last year, and junior defensive back Mike Sylvester (6-0, 180) has 
caught Harper's eye in game films. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Chris Sestito (6-1, 200) played extensively at linebacker last 
season, and Eric Bowman (6-4, 210) returns to the defensive line after an 
injury-plagued junior season. Harper said defensive lineman Ron Matthews (6-2, 
255) has been a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Greg Maw has graduated and Harper said he has not recruited a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in school history, Bob Shoup will not lead the Kingsmen into 
their opener. His replacement, Harper, has won 117 games in 18 years as a 
college head coach.

OCCIDENTAL;

<P>
TIGERS WILL HAVE TO CUT LOSSES TO GAIN PLAYOFFS

<P>
Occidental College claimed its third consecutive Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championship last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the pervasive feeling in the Occidental program as the Tigers 
prepare for their Sept. 8 opener at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goals are just a tad higher than we've been able to do lately," said 
Occidental Coach Dale Widolff, who has led his team to the SCIAC title six 
times in the past eight years. "We've been able to win league, but to get to 
the playoffs you have to be 9-0 or 8-1." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has not been to the NCAA Division III playoffs since 1985. Last 
year, with a team expected to contend for a postseason opportunity, the Tigers 
stumbled to an 0-2 start then finished 7-2 overall and 4-0-1 in conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Gone from that squad are quarterback Tony Werbelow and linebacker David Hodges, 
both four-year starters and team leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was probably a team that had a little more confidence because the 
kids could always turn to Hodges on defense and Werbelow on offense," Widolff 
said. "We have to find out who we can turn to this year. Somebody has to step 
forward and make plays for you." 
</P>
<P>
Widolff is buoyed by the return of an experienced offensive line and tailback 
Gary Little, a sophomore who gained 898 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is anchored by lineman Brady Dargan, a three-year starter. Those 
players form the nucleus of a team Widolff expects to again contend for the 
conference championship -- and the elusive playoff invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is as experienced as last year if you look at the offensive line and 
tight end," Widolff said. "Offensively, the big question marks are quarterback 
and fullback. If we can answer that quarterback question, we'll be in pretty 
good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Werbelow, however, will be no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
"The best we ever had," Widolff said of the two-year starter. Werbelow passed 
for 2,522 career yards despite playing in the Tigers' run-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be in a position where the quarterback has to win games for 
us," Widolff said. "We want to put that burden on the other parts of our team 
and let the guy be more of a role player. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a guy that makes good decisions and doesn't turn the ball 
over." 
</P>
<P>
The leading candidates to replace Werbelow include junior John Selle and 
sophomore Phil Engebretsen, neither of whom have much experience. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Derrick Williams from Crenshaw and Marc Dyer from Livermore are also 
battling for playing time along with junior Scott Thompson, a transfer from 
Butte College. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is expecting another big season from Little, a breakaway threat who 
averaged 112.3 yards a game last season and finished third in the SCIAC in 
rushing. Freshmen Darryl Dade and Charles Jordan will back up Little. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Little's success will be predicated on the performance of Alex Lebrija, 
who is making a transition from defensive line to fullback. Freshman Brian 
Madlangbayan also will see action at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have an experienced group of receivers, including senior Rob 
Leinbach, junior Scott Sand and sophomore Mark Krock. 
</P>
<P>
But the strength of the Occidental offense will be its experienced offensive 
line. Senior tackles Pete Tucker and Greg Garcia, senior center Sean O'Brien, 
junior guard Steve Johns and junior tight end David Grossklaus leave Widolff 
with just one guard position to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's defense, which allowed a conference-low 278.8 yards a game last 
season, not only lost Hodges but also Gary Etcheverry, who left after seven 
seasons as defensive coordinator to become head coach at Macalester College in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt replaces Etcheverry, but the Tigers will continue to use a 3-4 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we need to find a defensive lineman, a quality linebacker and a 
fourth defensive back that can play right away," Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Dargan, the defensive mainstay, will be joined on the line by nose guard Kelly 
Bynum with Robert Patterson and Scott Mitchell competing for the third slot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of Hodges, a Kodak All-American last season, Occidental still 
has some talented linebackers, including Jason Ramsey and Robert Lewis, who 
will start on the outside. Larry Schatz is back for his third season as a 
starter at inside linebacker; the battle for the other inside position is 
"still wide open," Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Three starters return to a secondary that was plagued by injuries last year and 
allowed several big plays that resulted in Tiger losses. 
</P>
<P>
Ben White will start at strong safety with Craig Hartley at free safety and 
Rick Mock at one of the corners. Jason Minami, Mike Winslow, Andrew Schmitt and 
Bob Kennedy are competing for the other cornerback position. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Collinsworth, an All-SCIAC selection in 1987 and 1988, returns for his 
fourth season as the Tigers' kicker. Leinbach will be the punter. 
</P>
<P>
Widolff expects Whittier, Redlands and La Verne to provide the most competition 
for the SCIAC title.

Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Landress, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-6; 2nd in West Valley League, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Canoga Park transfer Dave Erhardt gives Landress a pure 
passer at quarterback for the first time in years. In a conference stocked with 
marquee skill-position players, Landress said he "wouldn't trade him right now 
for anybody." Erhardt (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) was a two-year starter at Canoga 
Park and Landress said he expects to maximize the senior's talents by employing 
multiple offensive sets. The running backs, dubbed the Bash Brothers, are 
untested juniors Manny Valenzuela (5-11, 205) and Ray Haney (5-10, 200). 
Returning linemen Mike Wamsganz (6-2, 235), Justin Hladky (6-2, 230) and John 
Palacio (5-10, 205) will protect the backfield trio. Erhardt's targets include 
returning lettermen Lance Johnson (6-2, 215) and Brian Griggs (6-1, 220) at 
tight end and Robert Holquin (5-11, 170) at receiver. Johnson and Griggs also 
will start at linebacker. Nicknames abound in Landress' defense, which includes 
linemen Talon (The Viking) Sorensen and Min Tran (5-5, 185), who bench-presses 
370 pounds and has been tabbed "Baby Arnold" by teammates. Lettermen John 
McDonald (5-8, 165) and Delvon McDaniels (6-0, 190) will start in the 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Landress said that if Erhardt has the kind of year of which he is 
capable, Cleveland will turn some heads. "I think he can probably roll up a 
combined 2,000 yards with his running and passing," Landress said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Francola, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-7; 3rd in North Valley League, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: A quarterback battle seems likely between pocket passer Mike 
McMullen (6-5, 185) and scrambler Tavarus Logi (5-9, 170). Whoever earns the 
starting nod -- and Francola says he might alternate the two -- will spend most 
of his time trying to get the ball to senior tailback Ontiwaun Carter. A 
three-year starter, the cat-quick Carter (5-10, 175) rushed for 1,563 yards in 
1989, best among area City players. Eight starters return on defense, which 
improved toward the end of the season. Returning in the secondary are Billy 
Sanders (6-0, 160), Anthony Jones (6-1, 180) and Frank Conley (5-7, 155). Damon 
Tice (6-0, 215) and Alex Sawatzke (6-0, 200) return at linebacker. Jess 
Rodriguez (6-1, 245), the team leader in sacks, starts at defensive tackle. The 
offensive line is young and is led by returning starting guards Craig Gardner 
(6-1 1/2, 255) and Troy Bregel (6-1 1/2, 210), both juniors. Juniors Danny 
Milliken (6-3, 225) and Brian Meza (5-10, 245) will start at tackle. Three-year 
starter and All-City soccer player Keith West (6-0, 175) will be the lone 
two-way starter and then some; he plays at receiver, safety, punter and kicker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: If the young offensive line holds, Carter again should lead area City 
players in rushing. But that might be only half the story; Francola also plans 
to throw more often to Carter out of the backfield. Francola believes that last 
season's youth movement -- he started six sophomores -- could give Kennedy an 
edge. "I think it should be between (San) Fernando and us, with Cleveland 
deserving a good look." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Joel Schaeffer, 13th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-3-2; 2nd in Mid-Valley League, 4-2-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Forgive Schaeffer if he feels singled out, but for the first 
time in memory, he believes he does not have an NCAA Division I prospect on the 
team. Not exactly a good time to be moved from the 3-A Division to 4-A. Reseda 
might field one of its smallest teams in several years. As many as eight 
starters might play both ways. Maurice Stepter (5-9, 165), who played fullback 
last season and opened the way for 1990 graduate Joe Tushnet, moves to tailback 
and also will start in the secondary. Juniors Dion Edwards (5-9, 170) and Jeff 
Kent (6-3, 190) are battling for the nod at quarterback. Reseda's strength is 
its offensive line with three-year starters Edgar Fernandez (5-10, 195) and 
Mike Green (5-10, 195), both of whom also start at linebacker. Alex Mekari 
(6-0, 200) and Mike Johnston (5-11, 200) are returning starters at defensive 
tackle. Tim Schaeffer (5-10, 175), son of the coach, will play tight end and 
outside linebacker. Ricky Ray (5-10, 185), who will play at fullback and in the 
secondary, is considered one of the team's best defensive players. Sophomore 
Gerald Cohl (5-8, 165) made 21 of 22 point-after touchdowns and six field goals 
last season on the B team. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Schaeffer pulls no punches in regard to his chances in the 4-A 
Division. He simply is not sure if he has the horses. "I feel like the cowboy 
riding into the canyon," he said. "You don't know if you're going to get 
ambushed or not." Then again, coaches in the conference have not gone up 
against Schaeffer, either. He says they won't see anything that is too 
startling. "I haven't done anything different for 20 years," he said. "I may 
have a few little surprises, but what we've been using seems to work pretty 
well, so why not stick with it?" 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Hernandez, 9th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-6; 2nd in North Valley League, 5-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Call it a study in relativity. Included in San Fernando's 
reinstituted wishbone backfield are brothers Leonice and Johnny Brown, the 
uncles of former Crespi standout Russell White. Leonice (6-2, 185) rushed for 
1,097 yards as a junior at Crespi last season before transferring. Johnny, a 
sophomore, is 5-10, 160. Mighty-mite tailback LaKarlos Townsend (5-8, 165) 
rushed for 464 yards and averaged 7.1 yards a carry as a sophomore last year 
and will start in the secondary. Senior Cruz Trevino (5-10, 170) will start at 
quarterback. Tony Brown (5-11, 170) is a sophomore who also will play 
cornerback. Only one starter returns at the same position on defense, safety 
Keith Woods (5-11, 175). Keith's brother, James Woods (5-11, 185), will start 
at linebacker. Will Taylor (5-11, 180) moves from safety to linebacker and also 
will play running back. Mike Garcia (5-11, 190) moves from outside to inside 
linebacker. Sophomore Ernie Salazar (6-1, 200), a fourth cousin of the late 
Ritchie Valens, will start at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: San Fernando was bombed in nonleague losses to Fontana, Crespi and St. 
Paul to open the 1989 season before rallying in conference play. Things should 
go smoother this time, with Fremont, Van Nuys and Dorsey on the nonleague 
schedule. The best news? Granada Hills, which has won or shared four 
consecutive North Valley titles, has moved to the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Myron Gibford, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-5-1; 4th in North Valley League, 2-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The offensive backfield is stocked with talented senior 
running backs, but a key to Chatsworth's success might be in how well its 
untested offensive line performs. A trio of potential game-breakers will split 
time at running back and also will play in the secondary. Rayna Stewart 
(5-foot-10, 175 pounds) rushed for 159 yards in 21 carries last season, Mukasa 
Crowe (5-10, 160) gained 123 in 18 attempts and Joynier Lockett (5-10, 175) has 
regained his academic eligibility. All are seniors. "They are all very, very 
good," Gibford said. "Each is an outstanding football player." Senior Brandon 
Reudy (6-0, 190) returns at quarterback but is being pressed by Brian Comer 
(5-10, 150), who led the B team to a league title as a junior last year. 
Offensive tackle Rob Lurie (5-10, 215) is the only returning starter on the 
offensive line, however. Delvon Hardaway (6-0, 165), a three-year starter, will 
play at receiver and cornerback. Montay Hardison (5-9, 180) returns at inside 
linebacker. Chatsworth allowed just 120 points in nine games last year, and 
defense again will be a strength. "With the guys we have in the secondary, we 
should be as good or better defensively," Gibford said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The defense allowed an average of 211 yards a game in 1989, but the 
offense averaged just 143. With increased offensive production, the Chancellors 
could shadow the leaders of the pack. "I think it's the best football team 
we've had in the last three years," Gibford said. "I don't know if we're ready 
to play with the big boys yet, but it's a good group." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Maio and Ralph Stam, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-6; 2nd in West Valley League, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season's playoff upset of unbeaten and top-seeded 
Granada Hills might have marked the return of the Conquistadores, a team that 
was the pride of the Valley in the late 1970s but hit the skids from 1986-88. 
The Conquistadores beat the Highlanders up front with superior defensive 
linemen and linebackers, and although there are several holes to fill, this 
area again will be a team strength. "We don't have that kind of quickness and 
size," Maio said. "But we have some experience there." Troy Snider, an 
all-league selection last year as a junior, returns. Snyder (6-1, 215) and 
Chris Griggs (5-10, 170), another starter last season, anchor the linebacking 
corps. The secondary will be patrolled by hard-hitting safeties Sean Boldt 
(6-2, 175) and Ryan Marine (5-10, 170). Boldt is one of three candidates for 
the quarterback position, a group that includes Evan Howland and Terry Morrow. 
All three will play baseball for Maio in the spring. Marine is a likely starter 
at running back. Jeff Sardell (6-3, 240) and Juan Hernandez (5-10, 185) will 
play on the offensive and defensive lines. Kicker Joe La Firenza returns. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Conquistadores admittedly were a one-dimensional team last season, 
with running back Jamal Anderson -- who rushed for a school-record 1,153 yards 
-- accounting for more than half of the team's total of 2,006 yards. El Camino 
Real passed for a mere 257 yards. "We're planning on opening it up a little bit 
more," Maio said. "At least, we'd like to pass the ball more often." While El 
Camino Real might not duplicate last season's success, the Conquistadores are 
again competitive, something that could not be said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Darryl Stroh and Tom Harp, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-1; 1st in North Valley League, 7-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The nucleus returns, forming the Valley's most atomic 
offensive threat. Brett Washington, The Times' Valley lineman of the year as a 
junior, is ready to again dish it out and take it as a linebacker and running 
back. Washington (5-11, 225) rushed for 1,156 yards and 12 touchdowns in '89. 
Senior quarterback Bryan Martin (6-2, 180) passed for 1,414 yards and 15 
touchdowns and ranked among the area's best punters last year. Senior safety 
Derrick Stewart (5-11, 185) will play at tailback as well as strong safety. All 
three are considered NCAA Division I prospects. Senior Robert Haywood (6-0, 
190), another three-year starter, will play tight end and defensive back. 
Granada Hills' offensive line, a problem area at times last year, is more 
mature. Starting linemen David Villa (5-11, 205) and Jordan Fisher (5-11, 200) 
return and reserves Greg King (6-2, 230) and Ralph Courtney (6-2, 215) also 
lettered last season. "It's one of our biggest lines ever," Harp said. Eric 
Moss (5-10, 170) and Alonzo Finney (6-0, 175) will start at receiver, with Moss 
also scheduled to play at his all-league position in the secondary. Returning 
starter Rob Kalinowski (6-0, 225) will anchor the defensive line. Washington, 
Finney and Curt Hulshizer (5-11, 185) will start at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Granada Hills, which last season raced to a school-record 10-0 start 
before dropping its first-round playoff game to El Camino Real, was 24-2 in 
recent summer passing-league competition. Expect the Highlanders to come out 
firing, especially Martin, who won't be distracted by splitting time at 
quarterback, as he did in 1989. "The whole team is ahead of where we were last 
year," Harp said. "We have experience. Everyone started at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Stevenson, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-5; 1st in West Valley League, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Long a run-oriented team, the Toreadors might finally have 
the tools to open up the offense. "We've got great skill people," Stevenson 
said. "This is probably the best group we've had." Behind junior quarterback 
Karlon Mack (6-3, 190), Taft will have the ability to successfully try the 
airwaves, Stevenson believes. "He's got a very good (arm) and he can really 
run," Stevenson said of Mack, who was ineligible last season. Returning 
starters Vance Swendell (5-9, 175) and Darnell Hendricks (6-3, 190) will play 
at running back. Hendricks played last year at tight end and safety, a position 
at which some consider him a can't-miss NCAA Division I prospect. Daryl (Happy) 
Cash (5-11, 180) returns at linebacker and receiver, and Tekro Blade (6-3, 205) 
is back at tight end and linebacker. Other returning starters include defensive 
lineman Willie Jackson (6-3, 225), two-way lineman Mario Alvarado (6-1, 245) 
and offensive guard Greg Levy (6-0, 175). Jackson reportedly bench-presses 450 
pounds and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Sam Hardy (6-4, 245) will 
start at middle linebacker and is "potentially the best player we've ever had 
there," Stevenson said. Receiver-safety Ruben Benitez (5-10, 165) can cover 
some ground -- he was seventh in the state in the 400 meters last season in 
47.89. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Toreadors will be entertaining to watch and could pose some 
problems for league favorite Granada Hills. Avoiding injuries could be a key. 
"This is a very good first group of kids," Stevenson said. "But after that, 
we're bad. I guess our best are better and our worse are worser."

<P>
Western State Conference teams failed to win a postseason bowl game last 
season, going 0-4-1, yet it is difficult to find a more powerful conference in 
Southern California this year than the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-team conference had six representatives (No. 3 Bakersfield College, No. 
5 Moorpark, No. 7 L. A. Southwest, No. 11 Ventura, No. 14 Santa Barbara and No. 
15 Glendale) among the top 15 in the JC Athletic Bureau's final Southern 
California poll last year and could post comparable numbers this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be a better team this year than we were last year," 11th-year Valley 
Coach Chuck Ferrero said, "but . . . so are most of the other teams in our 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (9-2, 8-1 in WSC play) and Bakersfield (8-1-2, 7-0-2) are favored to 
defend their Northern and Southern division titles, but there are plenty of 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at Valley-area teams in the WSC and Antelope Valley of the 
Foothill Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale: If the Vaqueros are to regain their position among the WSC's elite, 
they will have to improve on defense. Coming off a 10-2 season in 1988, 
Glendale dropped to 5-4-1 (5-3-1 in conference play) in '89, surrendering 26.8 
points a game. The offense, which averaged 32.5 points a game last year, should 
again be potent. Marco Arcipreste and Cole Speer, a transfer from Antelope 
Valley, will battle at quarterback. Cotie McMahon (5-foot-10, 160 pounds) leads 
the receivers. Fullback Wes Bender (5-10, 235), who gained 471 yards and scored 
14 touchdowns, returns for second-year Coach John Cicuto. Free safety Keith 
Franklin (6-2, 215), an All-Northern Division second-team pick, leads a defense 
that lacks experience on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark: Freddie Bradley (6-1, 187), a second-team All-American who rushed for 
1,266 yards and scored a nation-leading 23 touchdowns in the regular season, 
will lead the Raiders, who are looking for their third consecutive bowl 
appearance under 12th-year Coach Jim Bittner. Jamal Anderson (5-11, 205), who 
gained 1,153 yards for El Camino Real High last year, and former Oxnard High 
teammates Bryant Taylor (6-3, 215) and Johnel Turner (6-0, 200) are highly 
regarded freshmen. Anderson was a Times All-Valley selection at linebacker but 
likely will play running back. Turner, the quarterback in Oxnard's wishbone 
attack, will move to running back. Taylor, who rushed for 1,436 yards and 15 
touchdowns last season at Oxnard, has missed early workouts because of high 
blood pressure. Del Marine (5-11, 190), Kris Dutra (6-0, 187) and Chris 
Gadomski (6-0, 157) are competing at quarterback. The defense is led by 
linebackers Randy Spitzer (5-10, 205) and Matt Pearson (6-0, 208) and defensive 
backs Kenny Doll (5-11, 158) and Mack Humphrey (6-0, 205). 
</P>
<P>
Pierce: The Brahmas (4-6, 3-6) should be vastly improved entering their third 
season after a two-year hiatus. Quarterback Jamie Grossman, tailback Louis Vann 
and wide receiver Shannon Culver return for third-year Coach Bob Enger. 
Grossman, an All-Southern Division first-team pick, passed for 1,825 yards and 
11 touchdowns in nine games last season. Vann rushed for 510 yards and four 
touchdowns, and second-team pick Culver had 35 receptions for 556 yards and 
four touchdowns. All-Southern Division first-team defensive tackle David Walker 
(6-3, 280) and second-team linebacker Anania Hufanga (6-1, 230) anchor the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Valley: The Southern Division's player of the year on offense (Trendell 
Williams) and defense (Sam Edwards) return for the Monarchs (5-5-1, 5-4). 
Williams, who threw for 1,107 yards and four touchdowns during the regular 
season, will set up behind a talented offensive line whose starters average 6-2 
3/4 and 263 pounds. The secondary should be outstanding, led by Edwards (6-3, 
200), the WSC interception leader (eight) during the regular season, and Lamark 
Allen (5-11, 186), who picked off three passes. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura: Dick James, who coached Ventura from 1970-79, returns for a second 
term as the Pirates' coach. One of his first tasks will be to break in Tim 
Albrent (6-2, 205), last year's starting punter, at quarterback. The Pirates 
(7-4, 6-3) have three returning standouts in offensive lineman Carl Brewer 
(6-0, 280), kick returner Chris Thomas (6-2, 175) and defensive back Al 
Sanderson (6-0, 196), who had five interceptions during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley: After posting a combined 16-4-1 mark in the previous two 
seasons, the Marauders fell to 3-6-1 (2-5-1) last year, but Coach Brent Carder, 
entering his 21st season, expects an improved product. Quarterback Marty 
Washington (a former Grambling State redshirt) and wide receiver-defensive back 
Johnny Johnson of Palmdale High are promising newcomers.

Crescenta Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Beckenhauer, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-4; 3rd in league, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Once again, Beckenhauer is faced with the prospect of molding 
an undersized, inexperienced team into a winner. Only 29 players showed up for 
the Falcons' first practice and 27 weighed less than 200 pounds. Last season's 
team was similar in size (one player weighed more than 200 pounds) but had 
quarterback Ryan Kadletz, the first Crescenta Valley passer in six seasons to 
throw for more than 1,000 yards. Kadletz graduated and senior Stuart Foster and 
junior Aaron Shaeffer, a recently converted wide receiver, will compete to 
replace him. Jason Schwaiger, who gained 155 yards rushing in limited action 
last season, will play running back and inside linebacker. Schwaiger 
(5-foot-10, 185 pounds) was the team's second-leading tackler with 65. Jason 
Rountree (5-9, 160), a standout tailback on the sophomore team, also will carry 
the ball. The offensive line is small but experienced: tackles Dan Obradovich 
(6-1, 180) and Dan McCarty (6-0, 210) and guard Mark O'Neil (5-9, 170) return. 
Eric Steinlight, a second-team all-league defensive end, anchors the Falcon 
defense with Schwaiger. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The offensive line could click for the Falcons, but it needs a good 
quarterback to protect if Crescenta Valley is to be successful. Foster has 
limited varsity experience and Shaeffer is new to the position. Schwaiger is a 
solid ballcarrier, but he needs a passing threat to get his ground game going. 
Defensively, the Falcons are green. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Don Shoemaker, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-6; 5th in league, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Nine offensive players return and Shoemaker is looking for 
strong performances from the quarterback and backfield positions. Erik Kiesau 
(5-10, 170) completed 74 of 142 passes for 864 yards and four touchdowns as a 
junior, but with minus-106 yards rushing last year Kiesau will leave most of 
the running chores to fullback Hector Maya (5-10,205) and all-league tailback 
Pathon Rucker (6-0, 185 junior). Rucker rushed for 893 yards and seven 
touchdowns in 1989. "He's 15 to 20 pounds bigger and stronger," Shoemaker said. 
"I see him as one of the premier backs in the area." Albert Ocon (6-2, 260), a 
two-time all-league guard who is being recruited by all the Pacific 10 
Conference schools, and his brother Max, a 5-10, 210-pound tackle, will help 
create the holes for Maya and Rucker. Tim Hilton (5-9, 150) and Ely Enriquez 
(5-10, 160), an all-league defensive back, boast speed and agility as wide 
receivers. Receiver Axel Nielson (6-2, 190) caught 18 passes for 165 yards in 
'89. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Dynamiters' strength lies in their running game, but Shoemaker 
believes that the passing game is the key ingredient. "I think the season is 
going to come down to how effective Kiesau throws the ball," he said. The 
Pacific League is tough and Glendale opens league play against defending 
champion Arcadia, Pasadena and Division II co-champion Muir. "I don't see an 
easy game until we play Hoover at the end of the season," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dennis Hughes, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-9; 6th in league, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Tornadoes lost their starting backfield, linebackers, 
defensive backs and all but one offensive lineman and return 17 players, five 
of whom were starters. David Bronner was an all-league punter in 1989 with a 
39-yard average. He also will handle the kicking chores and occasionally will 
triple as a tight end. Halfbacks Ara Balkian (5-10, 175) and Alex Dixon (6-1, 
210), and fullback Charlie Barnes (5-10, 200) are starters in Hoover's wishbone 
attack. Balkian and Barnes also are potential starters at inside linebacker 
along with David Guerrero (5-10, 190). "Since Ara and Barnes start on offense, 
it would be great if David could beat one of them out so we can rest one of 
them for offense," Hughes said. Hughes will decide between Rene Gabri (6-0, 
170) and Walter Ulloa (5-8, 155) for the starting quarterback job. "Rene has 
more experience (but) Walter is quicker than Rene," Hughes said. Ulloa is a 
free safety in Hoover's split-four defense. Wide receiver candidates Koko 
Keledjian (6-2, 180) and junior Chris Kalaleh (6-1, 175) also will double at 
the corners. Raffe Guejeyan (5-9, 170) and Dixon are the outside linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With most starters playing both ways because of Hoover's lack of 
depth, it is doubtful that the Tornadoes will turn any heads in league play 
this season. "It's real questionable," Hughes said. "We're real young and real 
inexperienced. On defense we have kids who haven't played that much and our 
offensive line is inexperienced and so is our backfield."

Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Larry Edwards, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-9; 5th in league, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: It's a numbers game at Calabasas this season, and the magic 
number is 18: the number of players on the team. One of just two returning 
starters is senior quarterback Ron Adelman (5-foot-11, 190 pounds), who also 
will play linebacker. The other returning starter is junior Cameron LaBranche 
(6-3, 195), a tight end who will double at linebacker. After that, there mostly 
are new faces. Edwards likes his running backs, especially senior Matt Burrow 
(5-9, 160), who is in his first year of football, and junior Iman Mohtishimi 
(5-5, 130). Junior Dave Christenson (5-11, 165) also will play running back. 
All three running backs will play defense for Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The lack of numbers stems from a tiny senior class of just 90 boys, 
Edwards said. But the freshman and sophomore classes are bulging. Fifty-five 
players from the lower two classes will play on the freshman and junior varsity 
teams. "While it's a famine at the top, it's a feast at the bottom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Curtis Garner, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-2; 2nd in Tri-Valley League, 4-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Garner and the Flashes are still angry over their move up 
from Division IX to Division VIII. But the rest of the Frontier League is more 
concerned with Fillmore's returning players, especially All-Southern Section 
senior tailback Tory Cabral (6-0, 185), who gained 1,555 yards in 188 carries 
and scored 15 touchdowns as a junior. Art Sosa (5-9, 150) will be Fillmore's 
quarterback after backing up Chad Van Winkle last season. Sosa threw for 201 
yards and three touchdowns. Sosa, who will double as a defensive back, will 
throw to junior wide receiver-defensive back Rey Garnica (5-10, 155) and senior 
Steve Clinton (5-8, 145), a wide receiver-safety. Joining Cabral in the 
backfield is senior Anthony Chessani (6-0, 240), who missed his junior year. 
One sure starter at center and linebacker is senior Jason Rangel (6-0, 190). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: It's a new league and a new outlook for former Tri-Valley League entry 
Fillmore. The Flashes had the best season in school history in '89 but face 
stiffer competition in the likes of Santa Clara and Santa Paula. Still, Garner 
says, "We're going to be there when crunch time comes." 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Cliff Farrar, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-9; 6th in league, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With 15 lettermen returning, the Rangers are loaded with 
experience. What Farrar likes most is a secondary with three seniors: Darin 
Rich (5-9, 170), John Trent (6-0, 175) and Scott Baron (5-9, 170). Three 
starters also return on the offensive line: junior tackle Matt Johnson (6-2, 
210), senior tackle John Gatling (6-3, 260) and junior guard Jim Barrett (6-0, 
175). They will block for another letterman: running back Brandon Garnsey (5-7, 
155), whose strength is his quickness. Trent, senior Jaren Hoskins (5-9, 165) 
and sophomore Steve Saum (5-10, 165) are competing for the quarterback job. 
Mike Bowen and Bryan Salas, both 5-10, 165-pound seniors, are bookend 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Nordhoff has yet to win a Frontier League game under Farrar, and he is 
determined that 1990 will bring an end to that streak. With so much experience, 
it is likely that the Rangers will win -- at the very least -- one league game. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Tsoutsouvas, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-5; 4th in league, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Despite a fourth-place finish last year, the Cardinals have 
the talent to make teams think twice. Leading a strong offense is senior 
quarterback Ben Fausset (6-0, 175), who threw for 1,898 yards and 18 touchdowns 
as a junior. Fausset has a favorite and proven target in senior Dustin 
Magdaleno (5-9, 160), an all-league tailback who caught 47 passes last season. 
Magdaleno, who rushed for 172 yards, should lead the team in rushing again. 
Fausset's other receivers include Chris Gomez (5-10, 150), Art Marcelo (5-5, 
130), Randy Skaggs (5-5, 130) and Ray Rodriguez (5-11, 175). Other returning 
starters include senior linebacker-fullback Freddie Torres (5-8, 160), whom 
Tsoutsouvas calls "the hardest hitter on the team." Juan Enriquez (6-3, 220), a 
linebacker and offensive guard, and Brian Lister (6-2, 215), an offensive 
lineman-linebacker, add to the team's depth. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Santa Paula could be a surprise contender for the league title. 
Tsoutsouvas said that last year's team "never gelled the way we should have." 
If the players come together this year, the Cardinals could give Santa Clara 
and Fillmore a run for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Larry Lawrence, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-3; 1st in league, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Despite heavy losses to graduation among the skill-position 
players, last year's league champion still figures to pack a punch. Leading the 
offense is senior tailback Paul Muro (6-0, 197), a wideout last year who is 
expected to continue to catch many passes. Joining Muro in the backfield is 
senior fullback Scott Tripp (5-9, 165). The quarterback position is unresolved. 
Lawrence has yet to choose between junior Chris Macias (6-0, 165) and junior 
Allen Lyles (6-2, 160). The team's top receivers are senior Danny Lopez (5-9, 
150), who played cornerback last year, junior slotback Greg Macen (5-10, 175) 
and senior tight end Chad Brooks (6-2, 190). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Other coaches are tabbing the Saints as a favorite in the league. All 
Lawrence will say is that he is pleased that longtime league giant Agoura has 
left for the Marmonte League. "We're glad to get them out of there," he said.

</P>
<P>
COACH: Randy Stage, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-8-1; 6th in league, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior quarterback Jason Chandler (6-foot-1, 175 pounds) 
leads a green offense that was turnover-prone last season. Chandler, who became 
the starter midway through the season, passed for 378 yards and one touchdown 
but threw eight interceptions. Jay Sumner (5-11, 170), a two-year starter at 
inside linebacker, also will play running back and is joined there by Randye 
Rand (6-0, 180). Juan Valencia (6-2, 180) returns and starts at tight end and 
linebacker. Joe Valento (5-10, 170) caught six passes for 89 yards in '89 and 
will start at receiver and safety. Mike Lyneis (6-0, 160) and Trevor Dossen 
(5-11, 165) join Valento at receiver. Two-way tackles Frank Elenes (6-4, 250) 
and Larry Livengood (6-5, 260) saw limited action as juniors and lead the 
Burbank line corps. Brothers Frank (6-0, 205) and Steve Brenes (6-0, 190) will 
start at defensive end and linebacker, respectively. Del Cerna (6-2, 200), a 
transfer from Concord, Calif., will start at inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Burbank's junior-varsity team was 5-5 last season, which should 
provide an infusion of talent to a squad whose leading rusher in 1989 gained 
206 yards. Yet experience is a pressing problem. "We're keeping (the offense) 
basic because we're so young," Stage said. "We'd like an offense that's 
aggressive and doesn't turn the ball over. We must have had 14 interceptions 
last season (actually 19). We're going to try to cut it to 13." A sense of 
humor won't hurt.

Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Butch McElwee, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-8; tied for 3rd in league, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Marco Esquivel (5-9, 160), a 15-year-old junior, becomes 
Burroughs' second quarterback named Marco in the past three seasons. Marco 
Arcipresti started two years ago. "He's a very intelligent player and he's 
still growing," McElwee said of Esquivel. "He has pretty good speed." Eric 
Arciniega (6-0, 215), a two-year starter on the defensive line, will try his 
hand at fullback. Arciniega is "by far the best player on the team," McElwee 
said. The rest of the running backs, Steve Garza (5-9, 145) and Ben Goldwasser 
(6-1, 190), also are new at the position. Burroughs has the nucleus of a good 
offensive line behind returning starters Brian Feola (6-1, 215) and Jason Bess 
(6-2, 225). Brad Pike (6-4, 215) has the size to stand out at tight end. 
Defensive backs include Tim Reiter (5-9, 150) and Vince Luizzi (6-4, 185). 
Luizzi's brother, Bruce, now plays defensive back at USC. "He could be as good 
or better than Bruce if he keeps his head together," McElwee said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We have some real good skill kids, but we don't have much 
experience," McElwee said. "It's a good team, we're just young. We need to be 
good teachers this year." What Burroughs lacks in numbers -- the roster will 
consist of about 40 players -- it makes up for in speed. McElwee says he has a 
dozen players who can run the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds or less. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Herrington, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-2; first in league, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Hart scored 427 points last year but no skill players return. 
"It might take us a while to get rolling," said Herrington, whose team is 
ranked seventh in the Division III preseason poll. Junior Ryan Connors (5-11, 
180), who led the sophomore team to a league title last season, has earned the 
starting nod at quarterback. "He's got a real good arm and he's progressed 
quite well in summer league," Herrington said. Tucker Setterberg (6-1, 180), 
Jami Wolocko (5-10, 180) and Scott Blanchard (5-8, 165) are battling it out at 
tailback. Setterberg and Wolocko also return to start at linebacker and 
defensive back. George Kase (6-3, 220) has a school-record 18 career sacks as 
an end in addition to starting at tight end. Tim DeGroote (6-3, 260) is a 
Division I prospect at center and a returning Times All-Valley selection. Guard 
Brandon Best (6-3, 215) and tackle Eric Freund (6-5, 225) return in the 
offensive line. Doug Distaso (6-0, 180), Brian Bernier (5-10, 160) and Dane 
Ganshirt (5-8, 160) lead a group of untested receivers. Dan McKeon (5-8, 180) 
will play at inside linebacker. All-league kicker Brady Vilenski (48 of 51 
point-after touchdowns) might be the best in the area. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Hart played well in summer-league competition, but, says Herrington, 
"Enough of that fake stuff. Let's see what we can do when it counts." A lack of 
experience will not stop Hart from airing it out. "We'll still be throwing the 
ball as far as the stats go," Herrington said. "But we want to be able to 
control the ball against some of the better teams." With three returning 
offensive linemen, Hart might be afforded the opportunity to run and pass.

Vandals spray-painted swastikas on the inside of a black couple's home and did 
an estimated $30,000 damage, virtually wrecking the interior of the Agoura area 
house, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Szebelski L. Freeman, 68, and his wife Matilda, 69, returned to their house

Furniture was slashed and broken, holes were kicked in the walls, paintings 
were torn from their frames and thrown about, lamps and a fish tank were broken 
and food was taken from the freezer and left out to spoil, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The house is located in an expensive neighborhood of the unincorporated Agoura 
area. 
</P>

Vander Beatty, a former state senator and congressional candidate from 
Brooklyn, was shot in the head and killed today while campaigning for a 
Democratic Party position. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was shot twice in the head at his office at 1:22 p.m. and died at 1:45 
p.m. at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for a man who was reported to have fled the scene after 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, 49, an imposing 6-foot-tall politician, was once a Brooklyn political 
powerhouse and leading black activist, but was brought down by an avalanche of 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
He left his state Senate post in 1982 to make an ill-fated bid to run for the 
U.S. House seat held by longtime Rep. Shirley Chisholm. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to force a new election after his defeat by Major Owens, he and 
others forged voter registration cards and he was later convicted of forgery

Brian Keenan, who spent 4 1/2 years as a hostage in Lebanon, today called for 
negotiations to release others from a captivity he recalled as "a silent 
screaming slide into the bowels of ultimate despair." 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to talk. It's obviously time to talk. There is a willingness. Why 
not talk?" Keenan said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was released by his captors last 
week and handed over to Irish authorities in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday. He 
was released from the private Mater Hospital in Dublin this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking slowly, sometimes pausing to avoid crying, Keenan talked at length 
about life in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Hostage is crucifying aloneness. There's a silent screaming slide into the 
bowels of ultimate despair," he said, reading from a handwritten statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of chaos and feeling 
his fingers slowly straightening." 
</P>
<P>
"Tiny, tiny cells, constant blindfolds, prolonged days in the dark, sometimes 
weeks without light, create kinds of insanity that drive men deep, deep into 
themselves," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan, who was teaching English in Beirut when he was kidnaped April 11, 1986, 
spoke with particular affection of British journalist John McCarthy, with whom 
he was held. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful apprehension, but 
the irrepressible wit that is the golden kernel of John coped ultimately and 
always emerged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Morrell, McCarthy's friend who was seated behind Keenan, broke into a 
bright smile as Keenan talked about his fellow captive. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan described American hostage Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East 
correspondent of the Associated Press, as "a bulky and belligerent 
newspaperman" with a voracious appetite for intellectual conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Sutherland, a Scottish-born American who was acting dean of agriculture 
at the American University of Beirut, gave the other hostages long lectures on 
genetics, animal husbandry and his beloved 27-year-old Volvo car, Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan said Anderson suffered from a digestive ailment and was often in pain, 
but he took it stoically "for in truth all pain and illness was generally 
dismissed by our keepers, though they would eventually supply us with some form 
of antibiotics."

Washington natives who are vocal in their displeasure at the influx of 
Californians had better be more discreet or else start thinking defensively. 
Californians are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old Seattle-area woman learned the hard way Tuesday when she yelled, 
"Go back to California" at a Jeep with California license plates that had cut 
her off. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Jeep, a clean-cut guy about 35 wearing a tie, screeched to a 
halt, roared backward, jumped out screaming obscenities and pummeled her small 
truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so stunned that he would stop his vehicle and back up three car lengths, 
then start using the 'f-word' and other names. I thought I was dead. He did a 
beautiful karate kick to my truck," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
The man drove off after the woman dialed 911 on her car phone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"California is nice . . . but I really think he had a California attitude. I 
guess I am biased toward them, especially after this. 
</P>
<P>
"They ruined their own state and now they come up here and think they're going 
to move us over with their rudeness and fast driving," she said.

The 1989 infant mortality rate, at 9.7 per 1,000 live births, was the lowest 
ever recorded in the United States, while deaths due to AIDS rose to become the 
11th-leading killer, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 data, released by the National Center for Health Statistics, also 
showed life expectancy reaching a record high of 75.2 years and a continuing 
decline in death rates for various diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates reflect deaths of children before their first birthday. 
The 1989 infant mortality rate was 2% lower than the 1988 rate of 9.9 per 1,000 
live births. 
</P>
<P>
However, the decline in infant mortality has slowed in the last several years, 
particularly for black infants, for whom the rate is more than twice that for 
whites, the report said.

West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher removed one of the last 
political obstacles to German reunification today by pledging to limit the 
armed forces of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the 23-nation Conventional Forces in Europe talks, Genscher 
promised that his government will keep united German military strength to a 
ceiling of 370,000 within three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
The new ceilings, worked out during talks between West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in July, would cut by nearly 
half the combined forces of East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We Germans know that German unification must not be allowed to cause a shift 
in the balance of power in Europe and to harm the security interests of any 
country in Europe," Genscher told delegates to the CFE talks. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms that peace alone 
will emanate from German soil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The West German pledge, supported by East Germany, was a response to Soviet 
concern about the military potential of Germany, which is set to unite Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher urged the delegates from NATO and Warsaw Pact countries to intensify 
efforts to overcome remaining obstacles and conclude a first-stage arms treaty 
by early October.

A renegade paramilitary group agreed to disband after the Armenian Parliament 
outlawed it and declared a state of emergency, the republic's president 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Armenian National Army were to make a television appeal for 
several hundred members to turn in their weapons, Levon Ter-Petrosyan told 
Parliament, the official Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance of the appeal would defuse tensions in one of the Soviet Union's 
most volatile republics, where fighting with neighboring Azerbaijan has claimed 
hundreds of lives in the last two years.

A Playboy model drew five months in prison for not paying taxes on $398,000 
given to her by a rich elderly man and was ordered to stay away from men at 
night until her term begins. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Ann Conley, 35, was also fined $10,000 and placed on a year's probation 
Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Thomas Curran. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said businessman David Kritzik paid more than $1 million to Conley 
and her twin, Lynette Harris, for companionship and, in the case of Harris, 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was convicted in May of evading taxes on $686,000 from Kritzik, a 
widower who died last year at 89. She was sentenced to a year in prison and 
fined $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
Both women claimed that the money Kritzik gave them during their five-year 
relationship was a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Conley, who must report to prison within 30 days, was told to remain in her 
home between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without male companionship.

Japan's steel exports in July fell 14.5% from a year ago to 1.441 million tons, 
largely due to sluggish sales to the Soviet Union and China, the Japan Iron and 
Steel Federation said today.

<P>
The federation said exports to the Soviet Union plunged 85.2% and those to 
China plummeted 49.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States fell 12.9% to 287,000 tons while those to Taiwan 
decreased 19.9% to 138,000 tons, the federation said. Exports to South Korea 
dipped 1% to 145,000 tons, it said. The federation said sales to the Soviet 
Union and China for the first seven months of this year fell more than 60% from 
the same period of 1989.

Two of West Germany's leading car makers, Daimler-Benz AG and Volkswagen AG, 
today reported higher profits for the first half of 1990 despite a weaker auto 
market. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many auto makers are seeing their earnings squeezed, Daimler and 
VW both managed good interim results. 
</P>
<P>
Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, said its first-half group net profit rose 
1.3%, to $535 million, from $528 million in the same 1989 period. Sales for the 
half year rose 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to reach its full-year sales target of $54 billion. 
But it added that the mark's recent strong gains against the dollar and the yen 
are having an adverse effect on results. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen said its group net profit rose 6.2%, to $273 million, in the first 
six months of 1990, while sales rose 4.3%, to $22.44 billion.

BANK OF JAPAN RAISES DISCOUNT LOAN RATE TO 6%

<P>
The Bank of Japan today raised its key discount lending rate to 6% in a bid to 
curb inflation resulting from rising oil prices during the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate announcement came one day after the central bank ruled out 
rumors in local media that a rate hike was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
The increase from 5.25% is the second this year and the fifth since May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno told a news conference that higher oil prices 
added to already worrisome domestic inflationary pressures, prompting the 
central bank to act to slow inflation and stabilize financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking precautionary measures is very important for Japan, whose economic 
performance has such influence on the rest of the world," Mieno said. "We have 
to prevent domestic inflationary pressures from growing further in order not to 
disturb the world economy." 
</P>
<P>
Higher rates are expected to slow business capital expenditures and cool 
economic growth, and also generally discourage stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
But stock traders reacted positively to the central bank action anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index rose 775.17 points, or 3.11%, today to close at 25,669.96. 
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 144.10 yen, down 0.25 yen 
from 144.35 yen Wednesday. It opened at 143.60 yen and ranged between 143.60 
yen and 144.40 yen.

Energy prices rose sharply today in a broad rebound after Wednesday's sell-off, 
mostly on concerns over the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, the benchmark grade of U.S. 
crude, rose $1.37 to $27.29 a barrel at 1 p.m. on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, the world's largest energy market. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday prices fell nearly $2 a barrel to their lowest level in three 
weeks as OPEC freed its members to increase production during the Mideast 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But prices snapped back today. 
</P>
<P>
A delay in Iraq's promised release of Western women and children contributed to 
fresh worries about tensions in the Persian Gulf. And a temporary shutdown of a 
Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea also supported prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Refined product prices also rebounded today after falling along with crude oil 
on Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery jumped 6.38 cents to 
91.50 cents a gallon after falling 3.81 cents Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ongoing tensions in the Middle East continue to underpin prices, while OPEC's 
agreement allowing higher production by members limited gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries freed 
heavyweight producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to boost output. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel is trying to ensure that the U.N.-sponsored international embargo 
against oil from Iraq and Iraqi-held Kuwait does not create shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil has soared as high as $32 a barrel since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, from 
about $21 a barrel on Aug. 1 and as low as $14 a barrel in May. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, war jitters will keep oil prices above $25 while actual fighting 
would push them up another $20, international traders said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said that even with the increase in OPEC output, the market will be short 
1 million to 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say OPEC could supply an extra 3 million to 3.5 million 
barrels daily, compared with 4 million throttled by the embargo on Iraq.

Orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 1.6% in July, nearly regaining 
their loss in June as they continued to follow a zigzag path this year, the 
government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and non-durable goods 
totaled a seasonally adjusted $240.3 billion after a 1.9% decrease in June. 
</P>
<P>
Orders also declined in January and April and increased in February, March and 
May. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the increase in orders in July was for durable goods, up $3.5 billion, 
or 2.8%, to $128.2 billion," the report said. The increase was a slight 
downward revision from the 2.9% advance reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than three 
years -- had fallen 3% in June. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods orders gained 0.2%, to $112.1 billion, after falling 0.4% a 
month earlier.

The Philadelphia Eagles placed eight-year NFL veteran Dave Rimington on waivers 
today to make room on the roster for rookie running back James Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Rimington, a two-time Outland Trophy winner at Nebraska, started at center in 
all 16 regular-season games and a playoff game in 1988, the year he joined the 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he started in one regular season game and a playoff game and played 
in five others as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Rimington was a first-round 1983 draft pick by the Cincinnati Bengals, who 
waived him in the 1988 preseason. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Gray, acquired Wednesday, was the New England 
Patriots' third pick this year. He is Texas Tech's all-time leading rusher with 
742 carries for 4,066 yards and 45 touchdowns.

Redshirt freshman Frank Wycheck, one of the main weapons in the University of 
Maryland's one-back offensive set, has narrowly averted being ruled 
academically ineligible for the 1990 football season. 
</P>
<P>
Wycheck was declared academically eligible Wednesday after the academic support 
group within the university's athletic department reviewed his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Wycheck, 6-feet-2 and 214 pounds, was declared academically ineligible Tuesday 
by the same group because he was two-thousandths of a point away from the 
needed grade point average of 1.78, out of a possible 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Wycheck could have been devastating for the Terrapins, who are 
using the one-back set as their base offense this year. Maryland opens its 
season Saturday against Virginia Tech at Byrd Stadium.

SWITZER ACCUSES IRISH OF NCAA VIOLATION

Tony Brooks received an "improper inducement" from Notre Dame representatives 
while the Irish were attempting to enroll the running back, former Oklahoma 
Coach Barry Switzer says. 
</P>
<P>
In his newly released book, "Bootlegger's Boy," Switzer says the unidentified 
Notre Dame representatives gave Brooks a job paying $13.50 an hour immediately 
after he signed a letter of intent with the Irish in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks and Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously an inducement," Switzer told the Chicago Tribune in today's 
editions. "Schools can talk about summer jobs (after a player's freshman year), 
but nobody at Oklahoma was making that kind of money. They violated NCAA 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Several scandals, including NCAA rules violations within his program, forced 
Switzer to resign before the 1989 season. Switzer contests most of the NCAA 
charges in his book. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who was recruited by Oklahoma, said he chose Notre Dame for academic 
reasons. "Nobody connected with Notre Dame made any illegal offers to me," he 
said. "It's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said he believes Holtz and his coaching staff knew nothing about the 
arrangement. Under NCAA rules, though, a school can be held responsible for the 
actions of alumni and boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"If the allegations were true, it would come as a shock," Holtz said. 
"Otherwise, I have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer says Brooks asked at the time whether Oklahoma could match the promises 
offered by Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid had his hand out. He was asking for certain things," Switzer said. "He 
said he needed to work right away."

'CAGNEY, LACEY' PRODUCER WINS $2-MILLION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury has awarded television producer Mace Neufeld more than $2 million in a 
breach-of-contract suit against fellow "Cagney &amp; Lacey" producer Barney 
Rosenzweig and Orion Pictures Corp. 
</P>
<P>
After a 16-day trial, a Superior Court jury in Santa Monica on Wednesday 
assessed Rosenzweig $1.25 million and Orion $758,978, plus interest amounting 
to an additional $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Laurence Rittenband will decide Oct. 9 whether to certify, 
reduce or overturn the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment, there is absolutely no legal basis for either the judge or the 
Court of Appeal to diminish or reverse the jury award," said Neufeld's 
attorney, Daniel C. Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Orion nor Rosenzweig would comment, saying the matter is still in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld said he had contracts with Orion, then Filmways, and Rosenzweig 
entitling him to 50% of whatever the studio paid Rosenzweig during the first 
five years of "Cagney &amp; Lacey." The 1982-88 CBS police drama starring 
Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly was a Rosenzweig Prods.-Mace Neufeld production. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig made more than $5 million from the series in addition to the amount 
included in his original contract, Neufeld said, arguing that he was entitled 
to a corresponding increase.

CBS CONSIDERS SPECIAL SERIES ON GULF CRISIS

CBS officials have discussed the possibility of a late-night series of specials 
on the Persian Gulf crisis similar to those that led to ABC's "Nightline" 11 
years ago, a CBS News spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not definite at this point," spokesman Tom Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about that began after anchorman Dan Rather's interview with Saddam 
Hussein on Wednesday. Excerpts of the interview, conducted at midnight in 
Baghdad, were incorporated into a late-night Wednesday special co-anchored by 
Leslie Stahl and Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
Rather's interview with Hussein, whose Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait sparked the 
gulf crisis, was the first by a U.S. network anchorman since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Similar specials are "being considered, but we're taking it a day at a time at 
this point," said Goodman, adding that one was being planned for Thursday 
night, also co-anchored by Stahl and Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
While CBS executives have discussed the possibility of a regular late-night 
news series and "anything's a possibility, I think it'd be premature to say 
that it will happen," he said.

GUN DRAWN ON 3 ROCK FANS

Three fans of a British rock band performing on the late night television show 
"Into the Night" rushed the stage during Wednesday's taping, prompting a 
security guard to draw his gun, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Levine, spokesman for host Rick Dees, said the entire episode was 
captured by video cameras and shown on the show which was broadcast Wednesday 
night on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Members of The Mission/U.K., described as a "gothic rock" band with a youthful 
following, were performing during the 5:30 p.m. taping, when three young women 
rushed from the audience and toward the band's lead singer, Wayne Hussey, 
Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"The security guard pulled his gun, then a stagehand saw the guard pull his gun 
and he tackled him, saying, 'Don't shoot,' " Levine said. No shots were fired 
and no one was injured, Levine said. The excited fans were escorted from the 
stage at ABC Prospect Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped tape for a while and regained calm," he said. Levine said that 
although Dees was able to make light of the incident, it was apparent that he 
was shaken by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Security is going to be beefed up considerably for future shows," Levine said.

NEWTON'S JUDGMENT AGAINST NBC OVERTURNED; 
</P>
<P>
LIBEL: APPEALS COURT RULES THAT EVIDENCE FAILED TO SHOW MALICE TOWARD SINGER, 
WHO HAD BEEN AWARDED $5 MILLION.

<P>
A federal appeals court today dismissed Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton's 
$5-million libel judgment against NBC, ruling that the evidence failed to show 
malice toward Newton. 
</P>
<P>
The original $19-million jury verdict was the largest libel award in American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Three NBC stories in 1980 and 1981 claimed Newton had financed his 1980 
purchase of the Aladdin Hotel with mob money and that organized crime figures 
were the hidden ownership behind the resort. 
</P>
<P>
A Las Vegas jury found National Broadcasting Company Inc. guilty of defaming 
Newton in the broadcasts and awarded him $19 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge in February, 1989, reduced the amount to $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals today unanimously ruled in a 50-page 
opinion, "Our review of the uncontroverted testimony, together with the 
cumulation of the circumstantial and documentary evidence, reveals almost no 
evidence of actual malice, much less clear and convincing proof." 
</P>
<P>
Newton's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial that the network had a 
"total absence of institutional conscience." The Newton lawyers said the 
stories were designed to curry favor with "Tonight Show" host Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Carson lost out to Newton in a bid to buy the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las 
Vegas in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony indicated that the $85-million Aladdin purchase was funded by the 
Valley Bank of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Sued along with NBC were journalists Brian Ross and Ira Silverman, who were 
involved in the story. 
</P>
<P>
NBC attorney Floyd Abrams said during the trial that Newton created his own 
problems by turning to crime figures Guido Penosi and Frank Piccolo for help in 
halting death threats against his family. 
</P>
<P>
Newton argued that NBC showed malice by publishing statements that Piccolo was 
a hidden partner in Aladdin despite having Nevada Gaming Board testimony that 
Valley Bank financed the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court noted that testimony also showed that hidden interest in a 
casino is normally not actual ownership of a hotel but an interest in the 
"skim, the amount of casino receipts not reported to the appropriate 
authorities as receipts."

O'CONNOR PUTS ON WIG TO OBSERVE PROTESTERS

Irish singer Sinead O'Connor disguised herself with a brown wig and baseball 
cap Wednesday night as she watched demonstrators protesting her refusal to 
allow the American national anthem to be played before a concert. 
</P>
<P>
The cropped-haired 23-year-old singer went nearly unrecognized for a time 
outside the Saratoga Performing Arts Center but walked away when some fans and 
television reporters caught on. 
</P>
<P>
Later, during her concert, she thanked her fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said I had disrespect for the American people," O'Connor said. "I have 
nothing but respect for people of any country." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor drew the ire of protesters for her refusal to perform at the Garden 
State Arts Center in New Jersey last Friday unless the arena dispensed with its 
usual practice of playing "The Star-Spangled Banner" before concerts. Arena 
officials complied but later banned O'Connor from appearing there again. 
</P>
<P>
Several radio stations in New York and New Jersey have banned her songs. They 
were joined Wednesday by KGGI-FM in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 demonstrators sang the national anthem outside the Saratoga Performing 
Arts Center gates Wednesday evening and urged fans not to enter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, whose hits include "No One Compares 2 U" and "Mandinka," watched for 
more than half an hour without talking to the demonstrators or her fans, said 
Donna Eichmeyer, an arts center spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"She was concerned," Eichmeyer said. "She wanted to hear what they had to say." 
</P>
<P>
Four songs into her show, O'Connor stopped to tell the fans she was touched by 
their show of support. She also said she was gratified that the fans let the 
protest continue without incident, because the demonstrators "had a right to be 
there as well." 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Schock, a spokeswoman for O'Connor, called the decision by some radio 
stations to stop playing O'Connor songs "absurd."

VARIETY OF EVENTS HIGHLIGHT LATINO ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

More than 300 Latino artists will be featured in the Sept. 1-16 Los Angeles 
Festival in programs that include retrospectives of Mexican filmmakers Arturo 
Ripstein and Jaime Hermosillo, performances by the noted Chilean theater group 
El Gran Circo Teatro and a major exhibition of 130 Chicano art works. 
</P>
<P>
Although even L.A. Festival organizers admit that the Pacific-themed festival 
could not adequately represent all the Latino artistic activity going on in Los 
Angeles as well as all the Latin American countries bordering the Pacific, Los 
Angeles' cultural affairs chief praised the festival's Latino representation. 
</P>
<P>
"My general opinion is that they've done a pretty good job of trying to 
seriously address Latino artists from here in the city as well as from Latin 
America and other (Spanish-speaking) countries," said Adolfo Nodal, general 
manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's general manager, Michael Vargas, said: "The festival programs 
certainly serve a broad spectrum of the Latino public as well as the non-Latino 
public that is interested in Latino programming. . . . (But) we can only 
incorporate a small part of what's happening in L.A., because we're bringing 
everything together into a two-week period. But we've developed as much Latino 
programming and incorporated as many of the (Latino) institutions as we 
possibly could have." 
</P>
<P>
As with much of its non-Latino programming, the festival is simply 
incorporating several already-planned Latino arts events under its banner. 
Examples include "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985," a 
mammoth exhibition of 130 works by 90 artists from across the United States at 
UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and performances at various locations by several local 
musical groups. 
</P>
<P>
But, Vargas stressed, much of the programming will be new to Los Angeles' 
Latino audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's just the usual suspects at all," Vargas said. "Some of them 
might be, like the bandas and mariachi groups that perform here all the time, 
but we've got people like Daniel Martinez and Diane Gamboa and Harry Gamboa 
that are all pretty well known in Los Angeles but are doing something new that 
they haven't been able to do before -- a collaborative theater piece." 
</P>
<P>
The piece Vargas was referring to is Martinez's "Ignore the Dents," an "urban 
opera of social gridlock" being written by Harry Gamboa, with costumes by his 
sister Diane and lighting by designer Aubrey Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The collaborative piece will be performed Sept. 7-8 at Broadway's Million 
Dollar Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Also commissioned specifically for the festival is San Diego/Tijuana border 
artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena's multilingual performance solo "1990." The piece, 
part of his trilogy in progress, "1992," deals with the journey north into 
California of a Mexican performance artist who is a cross between a mariachi 
and a rock musician. It will be performed Sept. 12-16 at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
One of the festival's theatrical centerpieces, Chile's El Gran Circo Teatro, 
will perform two works in Spanish at the Santa Monica Pier. "La Negra Ester," 
to be performed Sept. 12-14, is a comic musical spectacle recounting the 
turbulent passion of a poet for a prostitute at the brothel where he sings for 
a living. And "Gran Circo Teatro de Chile Presenta al Gran Circo Teatro de 
Chile," scheduled for Sept. 15-16, tackles the last 20 troubling years of 
Chilean history. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the festival's Latino programming, Vargas noted, is the Sept. 
8-11 "La Terra Nova 1990: Pacific Poetry Festival" to be held in Eagle Rock at 
Occidental College's Keck Auditorium. A number of prominent Latin American 
poets will participate in the bilingual program with California poets reading 
the translations. 
</P>
<P>
"The poetry program is special; these poets have not been here before," Vargas 
said. "These kinds of things usually aren't included in a festival format, so 
that's been something new for us to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Also," Vargas continued, "the Hispanic films -- the Hermosillo films and the 
Ripstein films -- these are major filmmakers, and although they have been shown 
in this country before, they have not had major exposure in the United States. 
So this is a chance to expose Spanish-speaking people in L.A. to these 
filmmakers that they probably have heard of before, but have not seen." 
</P>
<P>
A controversial mural, one that has been shown only in sections since its 
creation in 1981, is scheduled to be unveiled Sept. 2 in its entirety at Union 
Station. The 16-foot by 80-foot mural by local artist Barbara Carrasco is 
titled "L.A. History -- A Mexican Perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Other visual arts programs include the Municipal Art Gallery's 'Aqui y Alla," 
which will feature contemporary works by artists from Los Angeles and Mexico 
City; Mixografia gallery's "Contemporary Mexican Masters," and Loyola 
Marymount's Laband Art Gallery's "Image and Identity: Recent Chicana Art from 
La Reina del Pueblo de Los Angeles de la Porciuncula," with works by Carrasco, 
Laura Aguilar, Diane Gamboa, Margaret Garcia and Dolores Guerrero-Cruz.

TOURING RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINES CHICANO ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

For some, the Chicano movement came and went. For others it is alive and 
gaining strength. But one of its enduring manifestations are the artworks, from 
pencil drawings to murals, which arose from the late 1960s to mid-1970s and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" (CARA) will chronicle the 
movement through art in its premiere exhibition at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery 
from Sept. 9 through Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Chicanos such as Luis Jimenez, Mel Casas, Judith F. Baca, Carmen Lomas-Garza 
and John Valadez will be among the 90 artists featured in the exhibit, along 
with group installations showcasing pieces by ASCO, Los Four and The Royal 
Chicano Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, held in conjunction with the Los Angeles Festival, is one of the 
largest assemblages ever of Chicano artworks, with 130 paintings, drawings, 
posters, sculptures, photographs and murals. 
</P>
<P>
"(CARA) will prove to be an informational, educational tool so that people 
understand that Chicano art is a viable and very strong force within American 
art -- that is, the United States and Latin America," said Teresa McKenna, CARA 
executive committee member and a professor of English at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano art is CARA's focus because "Hispanic usually refers to a 
conglomeration of Hispanic cultures, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and other Hispanic 
cultures," said CARA assistant publicist Lindsey Haley. 
</P>
<P>
"Latino also carries that kind of large connotation, whereas Chicano is a term 
that was developed during the Chicano movement to reflect the political 
attitude of affirmation," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the $1-million project met with 50 artists, authors and Chicano 
activists in 1985 to form the "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation" theme. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a process of self-definition. We tried to give artists and members of the 
Chicano community a chance to define who they are," said Wight Gallery curator 
Elizabeth Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
The CARA theme "has to do with the history of the Southwest, and the notion of 
resistance and affirmation has to do with culture, as well as politics. It has 
to do with the affirmation of one's culture in the face of political change," 
McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicano art is not that different from the so-called mainstream," according to 
Margarita Nieto, a professor of Chicano Studies at Cal State Northridge who has 
written on art for the past 14 years. "It has a bite to it, an aggressiveness . 
. . a vitality that comes from this confrontation, living on-the-edge feeling 
that is much a part of the aesthetics of contemporary art." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits will be divided into sections including the pre-movement; la causa: 
farm workers; cultural icons; civil liberties; urban images; regional 
expressions; Chicana feminist visions, and redefining American art. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of more than 40 murals from throughout the country will be shown in 
a large-scale slide presentation along with a videotape to show each mural in 
its social and geographical context. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 9, a special program, "Dia Para Los Angeles," will be held from noon 
to 5 p.m. The free activities will include speakers, music, dance, children's 
theater and bilingual tours of the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
After the three-month stay in Los Angeles, CARA will travel to Denver, 
Albuquerque, Tucson, San Francisco, Fresno, Washington, Madrid and Mexico City 
over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the Wight Art Gallery exhibit is free. Open Tuesdays 11 a.m. to 8 
p.m. and Wednesdays through Sundays 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Mondays and 
holidays. Docent tours will be conducted in English and Spanish. Parking ($4) 
via UCLA entrance at 405 Hilgard Ave.; (213) 825-9345.

Theatre Work -- Because of erroneous information provided by the Latino Theatre 
Lab, Nuestro Tiempo reported in its July issue that the drama work "August 29" 
was written by Violeta Calles. In fact, Calles is a ficticious name. The work 
was written as a collaborative project of the Latino Theater Lab of Los Angeles 
Theatre Center.

UTTERLY UNREFINED SHORT STORIES WIN A BIG FOLLOWING; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: RETIRED PLASTERER PUBLISHES AND MARKETS HIS OWN COLLECTION OF DOWN-HOME 
TALES, COMPLETE WITH LOUSY GRAMMAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Retired plasterer Walter Swan doesn't fit the image of a hot author. He wears 
denim coveralls and a black cowboy hat. At 15, he dropped out of the eighth 
grade after spending so much time there he had carved his initials in almost 
every desk in the school. By his own admission he can't write or spell. In his 
Bisbee, Ariz., bookstore, he proudly displays one of his report cards from 1932 
-- straight Fs in spelling and straight Ds in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know nothin' about writing," says the gregarious 73-year-old. "I don't 
even know what adjectives and vowels and things like that are. But I know 
plastering. I could plaster your house up one side and down the other." 
</P>
<P>
But his book, "me 'n Henry," a collection of down-home stories about Swan and 
his brother, Henry, growing up in Cochise County, is gaining widespread 
attention. He got a brief mention in Erma Bombeck's column, and he's been 
interviewed on radio talk shows in Salt Lake City and Boston. Several 
newspapers and TV stations in Arizona have sent reporters to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
Now the publicity is going national. "CBS This Morning" traveled to Bisbee to 
tape a spot on Swan and the "Tonight Show" is also trying to line him up for an 
appearance. And a man strolled into Swan's store and announced, "I'm with the 
Walt Disney Co. Have you sold the movie rights to that book yet?" Swan keeps 
the Disney fellow's phone number on a crumpled slip of paper in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going all over the country and I can't stop it," Swan says, amazed at his 
brush with fame. "But it ain't my fault. I just wrote a book." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers have no trouble finding Swan to place an order. After the Boston 
interview, he got more than 80 letters from people requesting copies. They were 
addressed to the One-Book Bookstore in Bisbee. That's right -- one book. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated that ordinary bookstores wouldn't stock "me 'n Henry," a 
self-published work marked by lousy grammar and a distinct lack of literary 
style, Swan plunked down $100 to rent a storefront cubicle along Main Street in 
this old copper mining town of 7,000. He hung a couple of crude signs on the 
front window, taped his report card to the wall, set up some folding chairs and 
a couple of tables piled high with the store's only book -- "me 'n Henry." 
</P>
<P>
Since his grand opening last year, he has sold 3,000 books. Counting the ones 
he sold before opening the store, Swan has moved 6,000 copies -- at $21.35 
each, including tax. "Fifteen minutes after I got in here I sold enough books 
to make my rent," Swan says. "I can't exaggerate how good it's going. At least 
10 times a day people come in and tell me what a hilarious book it is." 
</P>
<P>
The book is a collection of stories Swan told to his eight children as they 
were growing up. It is written like he talks, with sentences such as, "I was in 
the third grade a going to the Frontier School." At the encouragement of his 
wife, Deloris, he wrote the stories in longhand over a 30-year period. By the 
late '70s, when the Swans began searching for a publisher, there were enough 
stories to fill an apple crate. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years of disappointment followed, during which the couple racked up 14 
rejections from New York publishers. Not to be deterred, the Swans bought a 
computer and laser printer, and Deloris, then 66, taught herself how to use 
them. In September, 1988, they paid a Tucson printer $6,750 to publish 1,000 
hardback copies. They sold out within three weeks. Thus far, they've had four 
printings. 
</P>
<P>
Swan's initial sales strategy was to pack boxes of "me 'n Henry" into the trunk 
of his car and drive to autographing sessions at bookstores, gift shops and 
libraries around southern Arizona. Wherever he went, however, store owners took 
40% of the profits. And response to the book was so positive that Swan figured 
he could successfully set out on his own with the One-Book Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Swan's outgoing personality and tireless promotion are big reasons for the 
book's success. He talks up "me 'n Henry" wherever he goes. "You bought a book 
yet, Wayne?" he calls to a patron at a Bisbee lunch counter. As he strolls the 
sloping sidewalks of this hill town, passers-by say hello and Swan starts in on 
them, sizing them up for a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Swan argues that his literary style is important, too. He describes it this 
way: "I try to write so folks don't have a headache when they're done." But 
there is more to it than that: "It's all true stories," Swan says. "Second, 
there's no filth. And the clincher is there's no big words. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to like the one (story) about me gettin' my finger stuck in the 
Model-T car," says Swan. "Or the time the billy goat et my first-grade reader. 
But the funniest is my father accidentally drinkin' a pitcher full of my 
polliwogs." 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Swans' bookstore brought in almost $7,000. Swan has also taken 
out a subscription to Publisher's Weekly. "I want to get a line on the 
bestsellers and such," he says. And Deloris answers the couple's home phone 
with a cheerful "Swan Enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises include plans for four more self-published books -- "Me and 
Moma and How We Raised Eight Kids and Survived," "Cornbread, Milk, and Honey," 
"How to Be a Better Me" and "Uncle Walt's Bedtime Stories." 
</P>
<P>
But even if he hits it big, Swan doesn't plan any major purchases. He says 
he'll give some money to the Mormon Church for its missionary effort, and with 
the remainder he'll buy "two of the finest hogs I can find, some good bees, and 
some racing pigeons." 
</P>
<P>
As he awaits the next development in his remarkable good fortune, Swan 
continues to greet customers and curious tourists with a big howdy, and 
poo-poos the idea that he is becoming a celebrity. "All I am is Walter Swan," 
he says, "Never been nothin' else." 
</P>
<P>
That includes a good speller. A customer named Mike recently asked Swan to 
autograph a copy of "me 'n Henry." Swan thumbed back his black cowboy hat and 
happily obliged. But he spelled the man's name M-I-K.

THE OBSESSION; 
</P>
<P>
FOR YEARS, SI FRUMKIN IRKED THE JEWISH ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIS CRUSADE TO AID 
SOVIET JEWS. NOW HIS CAUSE IS IN THE MAINSTREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Head down, Si Frumkin stood quietly as he was introduced to the group of about 
35 affluent mainstream Jews. Although he was, for decades, one of the most 
relentless and troublesome voices speaking out on behalf of Soviet Jews, few in 
the room had heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
Frumkin mock-winced in embarrassment as the introduction was ended: "Since he 
retired in 1987, he has been devoting his full life to doing good deeds." 
</P>
<P>
Uncharacteristically formal in a tie and tweed jacket, Frumkin greeted them 
with his characteristic ironic humor, which often stops just short of sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations, he told the group, for having such smart parents and 
grandparents. They "got out." Otherwise they would not be sitting in a living 
room in Beverly Hills, but in Minsk or Kiev, waiting for Operation Exodus to 
get them out now. 
</P>
<P>
It was an unusual setting for Frumkin, now 60, a man whose battle for Soviet 
Jews has often set him outside of, or at odds with, local Jewish leadership. He 
has said of himself and the Southern California Council for Soviet Jews that he 
founded in 1968: "Frankly the Jewish Establishment doesn't like what we do." 
Yet, here he was at a parlor meeting for Operation Exodus, the massive 
fund-raising campaign to evacuate the Jews from the Soviet Union and help them 
settle in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Parlor meetings and fund raising are not his style. He is more comfortable in 
front of a street demonstration with a bullhorn or at an office machine 
churning out copies of "his latest" for every member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Over the decades he has moved radically from the left to the right, partly 
because of his single-mindedness about his cause. But he has kept his objective 
and has seen his issue become mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Frumkin, a Holocaust survivor, alluded only briefly to "the camps," 
concentrating instead on what happened to the survivors after liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"The world didn't give a damn. We were an embarrassment. The world didn't know 
what to do with us. It would have been better if we had died." 
</P>
<P>
His rage was all the more forceful for its containment. It lent authority and 
urgency to his remarks, his point being, "Now there is a place for Jews to go 
-- Israel." 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s a message from Soviet Jews began reaching the West, "Why have 
you forgotten us?" he said. "We remember now. After decades of fighting (for 
their right to emigrate), now we're getting our wish." He did not describe that 
fighting, the years of demonstrations at Soviet cultural events, of 
confrontations with the guardians of bureaucratic procedures, of being a gadfly 
to the discomfort and embarrassment of many in the Jewish Establishment. He has 
often called himself obsessed and driven in those years, and readily says it 
made him "a lousy father" to two sons, now grown, and broke up his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
He did tell, however, of his recent trips to the Soviet Union which led him to 
one conclusion: "They've got to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Before the parlor meeting was over, those assembled would fill out pledge cards 
amounting to more than $200,000, bringing Los Angeles that much closer to its 
goal of $36 million, part of a national goal of $420 million and a worldwide 
goal of $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
One man, Eugene Davis, clearly impressed and moved by Frumkin, went up to him 
at the end and said, "Si, you're a book that needs reading." 
</P>
<P>
Si Frumkin lives in Studio City with his second wife, Kathy. He runs the 
council out of a crammed study where the combination of office machines and 
weightlifting equipment leaves little room to walk. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty to look at though: The walls are covered with photographs of 
demonstrations and pictures of Frumkin with President Ronald Reagan, Jeane 
Kirkpatrick, Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), 
television commentator Bruce Herschensohn), newsman George Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
He has hung his family photos near the entry and history has given them a 
haunting effect. Most were taken in Lithuania in the years leading up to the 
Holocaust. Innocence, well-being, family ties and affection hang suspended in a 
time without much strife. Mother and son, grandfather as a schoolboy in the 
uniform of his military academy, a New Year's Eve party where the guests, his 
parents among them, in white-tie-and-tails elegance have paused, Champagne 
glasses in hand, for a semi-formal portrait. 
</P>
<P>
One picture stands out: his parents leaning on a fence in the woods on a sunny 
day, a little dog between them on the fence rail. 
</P>
<P>
"That was Tommy, my terrier. The Germans took him away. They wanted him because 
he was a purebred. It was just as well -- we couldn't feed him." 
</P>
<P>
Before he became Prisoner 82191 of Dachau, he was born and started to grow up 
in Kaunas as Simas Frumkinas. His was "a prominent family in an East European 
town," Frumkin said. His father was an automobile and motorcycle dealer, and 
when the Harley-Davidson salesman visited, he brought Si a present. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the only kid in Lithuania with a Mickey Mouse toothbrush." 
</P>
<P>
Affluent and assimilated, there was no shtetl life, no Yiddish, no visits to 
the synagogue. Just a yearly Passover dinner. 
</P>
<P>
To this day he is "quite irreligious" explaining it away a little lamely, 
saying, "I never acquired the habit. I never learned the prayers. I never made 
my bar mitzvah -- by then I was in the camps." 
</P>
<P>
The good life ended in stages. When the Soviets took over Lithuania in 1940, 
communism ended his father's business. In 1941 the Germans came, and the 40,000 
Jews of Kaunas were herded into a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire. When the 
ghetto was evacuated in 1944, there were about 7,000 surviving. The women were 
deported to Poland, the men to Germany. His father died "of weakness" 20 days 
before Dachau was liberated in 1945. Frumkin was 14. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding against a return to the Soviet Union, where survivors were being 
treated as collaborators, he joined the thousands wandering around Europe and 
made his way through the chaos to Italy where he and his mother reunited. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't resent the fact nobody wanted us. It didn't occur to me I had that 
right. Who knew from human rights? I didn't really even resent the Nazis. I was 
scared of them, but I didn't question it. It was like being scared of an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, "I wanted to go to the movies and chew gum. More than anything 
else I wanted to go to school and catch up on my education. I knew I was 
ignorant." 
</P>
<P>
He studied in Switzerland and England, emigrated briefly to Venezuela before 
coming to New York in 1949. He graduated from New York University in 1953. 
Years later, when he was married, living in Los Angeles and running the 
Universal Drapery Co. out of a Skid Row building, he earned a master's degree 
in history from Cal State Northridge at night. 
</P>
<P>
Once the message from Soviet Jews reached him, "Why have you forgotten us," 
Frumkin's drapery company increasingly became a sideline. His grab for normalcy 
seems to have come to a complete and permanent halt. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's stories about the early days of working with 
Frumkin on behalf of Soviet Jewry kept him going for two hours late one 
afternoon in his office at City Hall. If there is one story that sums up Si 
Frumkin, however, he would have to choose the one about the toilet plunger. 
</P>

A Soviet freighter came into Los Angeles Harbor in the early '70s, and 
Yaroslavsky and Frumkin rented a motorboat and chugged out to the ship, 
intending to paint "Let the Jews Go" on the side. But how to stay in place once 
the engine was shut off? Frumkin solved the problem. They moored themselves to 
the freighter with a toilet plunger. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a smart man," Yaroslavsky said, chuckling fondly. "He's so quick. 
His talents are so interchangeable. He'll be translating Russian one minute, 
fixing the refrigerator the next, figuring out the toilet plunger." 
</P>
<P>
Mention "Soviet Jews" in 1968, Frumkin said recently, and the average American, 
Jews included, would probably be puzzled, unaware that there were any Soviet 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were on Frumkin's mind, however, he was not going to rest. The Jewish 
Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles had a Commission on Soviet Jewry and 
Frumkin went to volunteer. He heard nothing for six months, he said, then 
learned a demonstration was planned during Passover in the Fairfax area. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking "the more publicity the better," he said, Frumkin took it upon himself 
to approach then-Councilman Tom Bradley, not going through channels. Bradley 
declared Soviet Jewry Day. "Did I get in trouble!" Frumkin said. "They told me 
I'd offended other councilmen." 
</P>
<P>
It was a bad fit from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Si was always more activist than corporate," Yaroslavsky explained. They met 
through the demonstration where Yaroslavsky, a UCLA student and leader of 
California Students for Soviet Jewry, spoke on his recent trip to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Both men found the Jewish Establishment, as represented by the Federation, too 
conservative, cautious and bureaucratic. Whatever their ideas, such as a 
candlelight walk in Westwood for Hanukkah, they were always cautioned not to 
rock the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The activist split off from Federation, formed the Council, teamed up with the 
student leader, and got going. Their modus operandi often bore the stamp of 
Frumkin's prankish wit. 
</P>
<P>
They hired a helicopter to fly over the Super Bowl with a banner: "Save Soviet 
Jewry." When Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev visited President Richard Nixon at 
San Clemente, they released 5,000 helium-filled balloons imprinted with "Let My 
People Go." When the Bolshoi Ballet came, they distributed fake programs 
outside the Shrine Auditorium which said: "Enjoy the show, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
They got accused of scare tactics, of intimidation in some of their boycott 
threats, such as their efforts to stop travel agents from promoting trips to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out there were other nuts like us across the country," Frumkin said. 
They teamed up to form the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Gimmicks such as sending greeting cards to Soviet Jews and the 
adopt-a-refusenik-family campaign were adopted across the country by 
synagogues. "Virtually everything that was done emanated from Si's head," 
Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem (with the Jewish Establishment) was not fear of our actions' 
effect on Jews in the Soviet Union. It was ego, turf and bureaucracy. We were 
making news. How do you explain to your boss, if you're being paid $41,000 a 
year in 1971 to do it, and there's this drapery salesman putting 10,000 people 
in the street?" 
</P>
<P>
Havi Scheindlin, who directed the Commission in the late '70s, recalled 
recently, "I was told, 'Don't get involved with his group. They have a 
different philosophy.' " 
</P>
<P>
There was an ideological split, she said. Frumkin, for example, worked with 
other dissident groups in the Soviet Union, rather than keeping Jews separate. 
Frumkin says he was often at odds with Israel and its supporters, because his 
Council insisted Jews should be allowed to emigrate wherever they wanted, not 
forced to go to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the differences, Frumkin and Yaroslavsky describe them in the past 
tense. In fact, Frumkin is now a member of the Commission's executive board. 
</P>
<P>
"The organized Jewish community came late to the issue," Scheindlin said. "If 
not for Si and Zev, it would never have happened to such a degree. By the end 
of my tenure there, it had happened. We were an issue to be contended with." 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, 72,000 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union. Their cause was a 
mainstream issue and Frumkin was burned out. He pulled back and the Council 
became dormant until the Gorbachev years. 
</P>
<P>
Frumkin is his own best enemy when it comes to slowing down. Having done well 
in the drapery business, and owning two commercial buildings, he was able to 
retire in 1987. "I never realized retirement could be such an Olympic event," 
he said dryly of his life now. He is driven, acknowledges he is full of 
survivor's guilt and a sense that he owes. He is seemingly incapable of not 
responding to the problem at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Soviet Jews started arriving here, he realized existing efforts to 
help them adjust were inadequate. He was a founding member of the Assn. of 
Soviet Jewish Emigres. There are lectures of the "how to write a resume and go 
on an interview" genre, clothing and household goods giveaways, a network of 
free medical care providers. Those who are established are urged to help the 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in very poor and very selfish," he told the group at the Operation 
Exodus gathering. "I'm happy to say, some of them are starting to give back. 
They're becoming mensches (responsible people) like the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
He speaks to students twice a week during the school year for the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, writes a weekly column for the B'nai 
B'rith Messenger and translates it for Panorama, a Russian-language weekly 
newspaper. His reactivated Council is sending books on Judaism and the history 
of anti-Semitism to Soviet Jews by the thousands. He keeps up the pressure on 
Soviet and American bureaucracies about visas. He does not stop. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures of Frumkin with conservative politicians and right-wing 
personalities are not the only indicator that the former Vietnam War protester 
has hung a right. 
</P>
<P>
His columns often wave the flag for America or Israel, and he comes down hard 
on peaceniks, anti-interventionists, Palestinian sympathizers, would-be flag 
burners, affirmative action advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes by, I suppose I've gotten righter and righter. At one time, I was 
on the board of Americans for Democratic Action. I have learned about the 
Soviet bloc and the oppression taking place. I have come to learn that 
communism and extreme socialism always hurts people . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And I've come to see that left-wing believers are a much greater menace to 
Jews than others. It's the left wing that raised anti-Semitism to the point 
where it is almost acceptable if you call it anti-Zionism. 'Zionism is racism' 
-- that's infamous." 
</P>
<P>
He sees a double standard operating often, for example, holding Israel to a 
higher standard than its neighbors, or making allowances for certain actions of 
minorities. He rejects it out of hand, arguing with a stubborn logic that keeps 
a narrow focus. 
</P>
<P>
He can work himself into a fury quickly and come out with hard-nosed 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the wrongfulness and "absurdity of classifying human beings by race" as 
a starting point, he took off on a tangent that included a scornful dismissal 
of recent Los Angeles County reapportionment attempts to ensure more Latino 
representation, and a question about why, if South Africa is so bad, do so many 
black Africans from other countries try to get in? 
</P>
<P>
"It's nonsense and it annoys the hell out of me," he said of quotas and an 
affirmative action mentality, before moving on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is the only country in the world where Arabs can vote and sit in 
Parliament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So Jews bought a building in East Jerusalem and want to live there, in the 
Arab quarter. Why not? There are Arabs living in the Jewish quarter and nobody 
talks about that." 
</P>
<P>
And then, the fury spent, he was back to being his own different drummer: 
</P>
<P>
"Having said all this, it's entirely possible if I were an Arab on the West 
Bank, I'd be out on the street throwing rocks. Once you believe you're 
oppressed . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At best, his stubbornness is idealistic, based on a lot of "shoulds." 
</P>
<P>
"I am idealistic," he said smiling, calmed down to irony again. "I guess I'm 
looking for fairness in an unfair world."

<P>
Gilbert Hyatt is a slender, bearded engineer who says he would never shoot the 
guns that are mounted over the fireplace in his modest, two-story home on a 
quiet La Palma cul de sac. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not afraid to take steady aim when necessary to get what is 
rightfully his. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little guy up against the big guys," Hyatt, 52, said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And this David landed a Goliath of a blow when it was revealed Tuesday that he 
had been awarded a U.S. patent in July for inventing the technology to create 
the microprocessor, or computer on a chip. Hyatt had sought the patent for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The news could turn the computer industry topsy-turvy and make Hyatt wealthy if 
he is able to collect millions of dollars in royalties from the world's 
computer chip makers. It could also earn him a spot as an inventor whose 
innovation changed the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that my invention was used to advance technology in so many ways," 
he said, bearing a permanent blush from the recent media attention. "But it was 
frustrating without the recognition. This patent has settled everything in my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
But the dispute is still far from being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The invention of the microprocessor, which has made possible most consumer 
electronic products including pocket calculators and personal computers, is 
frequently credited to a team of Intel Corp. engineers that included Ted Hoff, 
Federico Faggin and Stan Mazor. 
</P>
<P>
They began working on the idea to help a Japanese calculator company in 1969, 
although Intel's chip was not shipped until 1971. Texas Instruments also 
entered the market in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Hyatt, who has a stubborn streak that has been honed by two decades of 
legal battles and skepticism, says he is prepared to defend his claims against 
pretenders and deep-pocket companies that have until now been credited with the 
microprocessor's development. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said he makes a living as an aerospace consultant and hasn't worked for a 
big company for 25 years because he fears the environment would "stifle 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
When he worked to develop the microprocessor, it was for a company that he 
founded and ran himself. Micro Computer Inc., the start-up company, was funded 
by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a venture capital firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It grew to 25 employees between 1968 and 1971, but Hyatt said it folded in the 
midst of a dispute over rights to the technology. To his chagrin, rivals Intel 
and Texas Instruments received patents in the 1970s and developed millions of 
applications for microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hyatt could be faulted for being stubborn in refusing to share his 
patent rights, said Stuart Lubitz, a Los Angeles patent attorney who 
represented Micro Computer until it folded in 1971. Lubitz said Micro Computer 
fell apart because Hyatt resisted imparting the rights to his inventions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put Hyatt in the same boat with (chip pioneer Robert) Noyce or Jack 
Kilby," the Texas Instruments engineer who co-invented the integrated circuit 
and the hand-held calculator. "They were far more successful at advancing the 
state of the art and were not as obsessed with paper rights." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt acknowledged some stubbornness in his style, but he said he fought hard 
to have his patent approved because he believed that it was far more important 
than other inventions. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1970s, he continued to innovate but nearly soured on the 
inventing business after he was sued by Mattel Inc. for two electronics-related 
patents. He lost the suit to have his patents enforced, but a law firm in 
Washington saved him by picking up his legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken but spunky engineer has collected a patent for every year of 
his life. Much of his work in recent years has involved liquid crystal display 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Some inventors just invent, but I try to be broad in my areas of interest," he 
said. "I consider myself a scientist, an engineer and in some ways an 
entrepreneur."
