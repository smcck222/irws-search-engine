Vicki Sherling of Moultrie, Ga., named 1989 Teacher of the Year in Colquitt 
County, isn't allowed back in the classroom. Sherling was acquitted this week 
of charges that she grew marijuana in a greenhouse in her back yard. But for 
now, Supt. Billy Mock says he's not going to rehire her. Mock explained that 
the former high school chemistry teacher knew her husband, Mike, smoked pot and 
said that the issue is one of morality. Her husband, a former teacher and 
lawyer, has pleaded guilty to drug charges and is awaiting sentencing. "She 
admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that it was being used," 
Mock said. Sherling, 38, is now appealing her dismissal to the state Board of 
Education. "I feel great that finally the truth got out and I have cleared my 
name, which was my intent," she said. "I had the truth on my side." She has 
denied ever smoking marijuana and testified that she had pleaded with her 
husband to stop smoking it.

 -- "I won fair and square," said Miss America Gretchen Carlson from St. Paul, 
Minn. "I'm not refuting anything. I'm standing above it. This has been a 
wonderful year, and I have a ton of people to thank for that. Unfortunately, 
someone has seen fit to tarnish that." TV Guide, in its Sept. 2 issue, said 
that judges failed to count interview scores in last year's pageant. "We all 
knew way before the pageant that the interview would not be balloted on the 
final night," Carlson said. "But it was balloted in the preliminaries, in which 
the finalists were chosen." Carlson will end her reign Sept. 12.

The four-day Invention Convention opens in Pasadena today, and the latest crop 
of gizmos in search of financial backers includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Running shoes with springs on the soles, which allegedly cushion the knees 
and give more lift. (Warning: They have not been approved for use in the 
Olympic Games.) 
</P>
<P>
* A flying disc that contains a gyro, enabling it to be thrown more accurately. 
(Just think: No more bouncing one off that 240-pound guy who's asleep on the 
beach.) 
</P>
<P>
* And, Rapel, an anti-rape device that consists of a capsule filled with a 
synthetic skunk juice that can be punctured to ward off an attacker. Rapel also 
includes a companion capsule of skunk-juice neutralizer for the victim to use 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It completely removes the smell," said convention spokesman Jim Hughes. "And 
the would-be attacker can be easily detected." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the novelties are fresh off the drawing board. Canadian-born 
inventor Paul LeBlond has been trying to find a backer for Rapel for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The most profitable product of all may be the Invention Convention itself, 
which extracts fees from the inventors as well as $10 per head from members of 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
It's a laudable idea even if it doesn't sound very poetic. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn wants to proclaim September "Adjustable Wrench for Gas 
Meter Shut-Off Month," a challenge for any scroll-maker. The idea is for 
residents to familiarize themselves with how to shut off their gas in case they 
discover a leak after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, follows another disaster preparedness proclamation issued by 
Santa Clarita, which chose August to celebrate "Flashlight and Batteries 
Month."

Bruce Compilli of Pleasanton, Calif., was rolling in the money -- 60 tons of 
quarters -- at Universal Studios Wednesday. As the announced 60-millionth 
visitor to the attraction, he was given the opportunity to grab as many of the 
coins as he could in one minute. He then took the option of trading it all in 
for a mystery grand prize, which turned out to be $25,000 in cash and prizes. 
</P>

A s a young man, novelist William Faulkner worked in a post office in Oxford, 
Miss. So who knows? Maybe there's a another future winner of the Nobel Prize 
for Literature represented in the book, "Men &amp; Women of Letters: An 
Anthology of Short Stories by Letter Carriers." Among the entries included by 
Los Angeles-born editor John Yewell is "Tempe," by F. N. Wright of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, by the way, was fired from his postal job after he was accused of 
being so negligent that the only way residents could obtain their mail was to 
dig it out of the trash can at the back door of the post office. 
</P>
<P>
Even Faulkner would have been able to find the "AIRMAIL" box on a front lawn in 
Sherman Oaks. But the neighborhood landmark, perched on a 15-foot pole, doesn't 
really receive mail from the U.S. Postal Service or carrier pigeons, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
It's actually a signpost that the owner installed so that friends would be able 
to spot his house, which is hidden from traffic on fast-moving Beverly Glen 
Boulevard.

Vineyards Street, Mother Ditch and Grasshoppers Street might not ring a bell 
with workers in downtown Los Angeles today. But those were the names of roads 
in the Civic Center on Los Angeles Map No. 1, which was completed 140 years ago 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The map maker was Lt. Edward O.C. Ord, who was hired for $3,000 to number the 
blocks and lots of the impoverished town -- a task that was needed before the 
sale of public lands could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Some names, such as Vineyards, give a clue as to the agrarian character of the 
region. Vineyards, later Orchards, now is not-so-sweet-smelling San Pedro 
Street. Mother Ditch and Grasshoppers are better known today as Los Angeles and 
Figueroa Streets, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The dusty pueblo wasn't so sprawling then. In fact, Ord only bothered to number 
as far south as 8th Street. But he did draw unnamed streets as deep into the 
country as present-day Pico Boulevard.

When President Bush recently visited Poland and Hungary he responded very well 
to the two nations and their new road to freedom.

But on the 50th anniversary of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, when two dictators 
conspired against the Baltic states and their freedom, President Bush did not 
have the courage to say the same words about the Baltic states and their

GETTING NORIEGA OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today was to have been the day Panama celebrated the return of genuine 
democracy -- the day a new president popularly elected last May 7 was to be 
inaugurated. Instead, Panamanians will mark this date facing the grim reality 
that their country is still controlled by a thug, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega tried to steal the May election for his hand-picked candidate, then 
annulled the electoral process when it became apparent he could not produce 
enough phony votes to outweigh the support his opponents received. Noriega's 
supporters then began attacking his opponents, who took to the streets in 
peaceful protest against the electoral fraud. It looked for a time as if the 
international outcry that followed those bloody beatings would finally lead 
Noriega to give up power. But four months later that hasn't happened. Noriega's 
foreign critics did not know how patient and cunning he could be. 
</P>
<P>
This week the general began the process of selecting puppets who will fill 
posts in an interim government. They will take office today, and will keep him 
in the pivotal post of commander of Panama's military, the most powerful 
institution in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For two years President Reagan tried to pressure Noriega by using economic 
sanctions that badly damaged the Panamanian economy. President Bush extended 
Reagan's unsuccessful strategy, with one notable exception. After the May 
elections were nullified, Bush wisely called on the Organization of American 
States to mediate the political crisis in Panama, but it botched the job. A 
four-member OAS commission sent to Panama barely spent any time in the country 
and allowed Noriega to bog it down debating legal technicalities. Last week the 
commission issued an inconclusive report insisting it needed more time to make 
more progress. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated OAS diplomats also pointed an accusing finger at the United States, 
claiming that U.S. military commanders in the Canal Zone did not make things 
any easier for the mediators by continually ordering their troops into armed 
standoffs with the Panamanian Defense Forces. Their point is well taken. At a 
time when Bush insists that this country's argument is with Noriega and not the 
defense forces, it seems contradictory and even foolhardy for U.S. forces to 
stand toe-to-toe with Panamanian soldiers, as has happened several times in the 
last few weeks. Even the slightest U.S. military action carries negative 
overtones in Latin America, and especially in Panama. It makes Noriega look 
like a nationalist standing up to the gringo bully -- the only stance in which 
he can win. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Bush must now resist calls for even tougher sanctions against 
Panama, such as threats to abrogate the Panama Canal treaties or to use 
military force against Noriega. Force would surely get rid of Noriega, but it 
would create other problems throughout Latin America. It was reassuring that 
Bush said Thursday that he intends to continue applying multilateral diplomatic 
pressure on Noriega. But this time, it must be pursued more firmly and 
consistently than the OAS did in the first go-round. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than negotiating with the dictator, the OAS should put a permanent 
human-rights team in Panama to document whatever repressive measures Noriega 
uses to keep dissatisfaction with his rule from boiling over. That team would 
provide the bill of particulars that can be used to further isolate Noriega, as 
surely as other international pariahs like Libya and Iran are isolated. It 
would keep diplomatic pressure on the dictator until he again oversteps the 
bounds of decency, as he did in May. Then the campaign to oust him can be 
renewed with greater vigor. Until then, however, Noriega's opponents will have 
to display the same patience and cunning that he has shown these last few 
months. Waiting Noriega out won't be pleasant or easy. But given his past 
crudeness and brutality, Noriega will surely make the mistake that helps bring 
him down.

THE BALTIC AND EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been very pleased with your extensive coverage this year of the rapid 
changes occurring in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union concerning both 
domestic and foreign policy. Several times, however, I have been bothered by 
historical inaccuracies in articles discussing the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of limited sovereignty (circumscribed by the U.S.S.R.) in Eastern 
Europe does not stem solely from Brezhnev's justification of the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. In fact, limited sovereignty has been 
implicit in communist relations since the Communist International (Comintern) 
creation in 1919. Its definition of a socialist commonwealth presupposes that 
the community's larger interests necessarily transcend those of its national 
components. Centralization and subordination to a "strong guiding center" was 
one of the organization's charter "Twenty-One Points" in 1920. The only thing 
unique about Brezhnev and the 1968 invasion was that Brezhnev felt compelled by 
improving relations with the West to explicitly codify a long-standing 
principle. In contrast, Khrushchev, who in 1956 invaded Hungary, felt no 
compunction whatsoever to justify his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot really assert that Gorbachev has renounced the limited sovereignty 
principle because one of its fundamentals has yet to be tested. While the 
Communist Party's "leading role in society" is changing in Poland, and perhaps 
soon in Hungary as well, neither nation has taken steps to leave the Warsaw 
Pact. There are still strong economic, political, and symbolic ties that bind 
Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's non-interference policy in 
Eastern Europe does not constitute a renunciation of limited sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Where does the Soviet Union's threshold of tolerance for diversity and reform 
in Eastern Europe now lie? Historically, the answer has depended . . . on the 
geostrategic importance of the particular Soviet ally in question (contrast the 
Soviet reaction to the Romanian deviation with the Czechoslovakia invasion in 
the same time period). The prevailing ideology among policy-makers in the 
U.S.S.R. has played an equally strong role.

RUM, ROMANISM AND BARNEY FRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers 
University, is the author of House and Senate (W.W. Norton, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Politicians in trouble are a little like people suffering from terminal 
illness: They head for home hoping for a miraculous cure or at least for the 
comfort of dying among friends. This behavior is particularly noticeable among 
members of the House of Representatives, whose one-time Speaker, Tip O'Neill, 
advised newcomers that "all politics is local." He meant that House members 
lived or died politically by local issues, not national trends. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, the conduct of individual members of Congress ceases to 
be a strictly local issue and begins to raise questions beyond the narrow 
confines of a single congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
One official whose problems are not a matter of mere parochial importance is 
Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District. Frank, an 
acknowledged homosexual, has admitted that in 1985 he paid to have sex with a 
male prostitute and then embarked on a two-year relationship with the man. 
During that period, Frank hired the man for $20,000 in personal funds, as a 
driver and housekeeper. The man, Steven Gobie, was on parole at the time in 
Virginia. He had been convicted of sodomy, obscenity and possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's explanation for hiring Gobie was that he hoped to rescue Gobie from a 
life of drugs and degradation. Frank likened himself to Prof. Henry Higgins in 
George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," who raised up that forlorn mudsill of 
society, Eliza Doolittle. Frank was working with an inherently less noble 
product in Steven Gobie, who began using the congressman's apartment in 
Washington to continue his career as a prostitute. After Frank's landlord 
called his attention to Gobie's activities, Frank fired the man, but rehired 
him several months later when he claimed to be destitute. The final break came 
after Gobie, whose new duties included taking Frank's clothing to the cleaners, 
refused to return some of the garments. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, this sad and sordid event should be of concern only to the 
people of the 4th Congressional District. After all, Barney Frank is not Jim 
Wright. His offenses did not tie in closely with his public responsibilities, 
and he has stated that letters he wrote to Gobie's parole officer merely stated 
that the man was employed by Frank and applied no political pressure. Moreover, 
Frank himself has asked the House ethics committee to conduct an investigation 
into the case. 
</P>
<P>
Although Barney Frank's name is not a household word, the congressman is no 
dreary back-bencher. He is a leading liberal voice in the House, a persuasive 
and influential member who draws support beyond the borders of his Boston-area 
district. His hard-fought victory over Rep. Margaret Heckler in the 
redistricted 4th in 1982 was a triumph at a time of dark days for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes Frank's problems even more national in their implications is 
that they add one more bit of evidence that the Democrats are the party of 
moral turpitude. This is a knock against which they have been fighting since a 
Republican clergyman in 1884 proclaimed them to be the party of "rum, Romanism 
and rebellion." They were, after all, home to the treasonable Southerners, to 
Catholics who were widely believed to be getting their voting cues from Rome, 
and, worst of all, to the drinkers who favored the Democrats' liberal positions 
on alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Attack by alliteration was revived in the early 1970s when Democrats became the 
party of "acid, amnesty and abortion." But it was in the 1988 presidential 
election that charges against the Democrats for tolerating deviant and 
anti-social behavior reached a hysterical crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
By tormenting the Democrats so sadistically and skillfully with the positive 
symbol of the flag and the negative image of Willie Horton, the GOP may have 
encoded into the nation's political genes a picture of the Democrats as the 
party of moral laxity. It is certainly difficult for Democrats to refute the 
charge that their party has been far more hospitable to groups and movements 
well outside the mainstream of American culture than have the Republicans. The 
GOP, indeed, has advanced itself as the guardian of the most conventional 
social mores, so that when Republican politicians get caught with their pants 
down, their transgressions can be written off as exceptions to an otherwise 
sterling norm. Democrats lack that noble franchise in the popular mind. 
</P>
<P>
The strong liberal sentiments that flourish in his district will probably give 
Frank another term in 1990 unless more damaging evidence arises. It is even 
conceivable that Frank could be censured and still retain the support of a 
majority of his constituents as his colleague Gerry Studds did after he was 
censured for having sex with a young congressional page. 
</P>
<P>
But the affection of voters for their own representatives in Washington is 
often at odds with what is best for the House, the party or the country. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, Jim Wright would have been returned to Congress by voters in 
his district had he chosen to seek another term. But sometimes, as his 
departure demonstrated, the satisfaction of local acclaim is not enough. Barney 
Frank is too important a figure to take refuge in a parochial defense. There 
are values even greater than his own valuable incumbency.

PADRES WIN, 5-1, LOOK UP

<P>
It hardly seems possible, but it was just a week ago, remember, that these guys 
were out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Why, there was Tony Gwynn sitting in the clubhouse in Philadelphia giving a 
concession speech in midst of the Padres' 4-5 trip east. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery was drafting a retirement statement, planning to leave two days 
before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre hierarchy was on the phone, shopping position players and pitchers to 
contenders, never mind their own immediate needs. 
</P>
<P>
This was a team that had lost seven of its past 11 games (including three of 
five to the likes of Atlanta and Philadelphia), was 10 games out of first place 
and was just a bad home stand away from dropping into fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"A week ago, I'm not sure any of us would have believed this," Gwynn said. "But 
now, I don't think there's anyone in here that doesn't believe we can win this 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The secret is out. 
</P>
<P>
Once hoping to sneak up on Houston and San Francisco, these giddy Padres are 
letting it be known to anyone who cares to listen that they will have to be 
reckoned with in the final month. 
</P>
<P>
Take a peek: The Padres, 5-1 winners Thursday afternoon over Philadelphia, 
enter September 6 1/2 games behind the division-leading Giants, 2 1/2 behind 
the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
It's the closest they've been entering September since 1985, when they were six 
back before losing 11 of their next 13 to fall out of the race. In fact, except 
for 1984 -- when they won the only division title in their 20-year history -- 
the Padres have never been within four games of the division lead at any time 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to change our history around here," Flannery said. "We've got a 
chance to do something, and we can't wait to come to the ballpark to find a way 
to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in '84 when we won it, we had it clinched so soon (Sept. 20) that there 
was no real pennant stretch. This is what guys play their whole careers for. 
Playing in a losing season is useless. We've had enough of those." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (69-65), who certainly have had plenty of those -- finishing above 
.500 just four times in their history -- have won seven of their past eight and 
nine of 11 to create this euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the fans don't yet believe it, with just 15,541 showing up Thursday at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and a total of 57,362 coming out for the past four 
games. But you have to remember, this is the same town in which just 15,766 
came out the night the Padres clinched the title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we're disappointed in the fan turnout," Padre General Manager Tony 
Siegle said, "but I don't think in any way this reflects the attitude of the 
city. I went to get a haircut the other day, and everybody was wearing Padre 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this town's buzzing, and I know it sure is in this clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Heck, even Charger Coach Dan Henning jumped on the bandwagon, coming to the 
stadium Thursday before the game and visiting with Manager Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Times sure are changing, aren't they?" said McKeon, unable to suppress a grin. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who went out and acquired pitching depth Wednesday when they 
obtained Calvin Schiraldi, were awfully grateful Thursday that hadn't become 
impatient and traded Dennis Rasmussen to another contender for the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who had a 4-8 record and 4.41 ERA three weeks ago, has emerged as a 
vital cog to the Padre pennant hopes, winning his third consecutive start and 
the fourth of his past five. He's 4-1 with a 2.87 ERA in those five starts. 
</P>
<P>
But for a while Thursday, it looked as if this would be much more than just 
another victory. For 5 1/3 innings, he pitched a perfect game. For six, he had 
a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking about it when I got out there in the seventh," said 
Rasmussen (8-9). "When you get that far along in the game, you can't help it." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, pitching carefully to leadoff hitter Lenny Dykstra in the sixth, was 
unable to throw a third strike past him and eventually walked him on eight 
pitches. He fell behind to Tommy Herr, two and one, and then watched his 
no-hitter vanish when Herr drilled a fastball into right. John Kruk followed 
with another single, ending the shutout. Not wanting to risk any further 
erosion of the Padres' 4-1 lead, pitching coach Pat Dobson went to the mound 
and summoned Mark Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Grant induced Ricky Jordan to hit into a double play on his second pitch, 
struck out Von Hayes to end the inning and wound up finishing for his second 
save. 
</P>
<P>
"After last night's loss broke our winning streak," Rasmussen said, "I know 
everybody thought we had to have a win going into our off-day. Winning breeds 
confidence, and right now, I think we all have that. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at my numbers, and they're not spectacular, but I feel as confident 
as I've ever been. It's contagious." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grant, who has pitched 8 2/3 innings without allowing a run in his past 
three outings, picking up a victory and two saves: "This is the best time I've 
ever had. It's really the first time in my major league career I've had 
success. I know what it's like to be on a brutal team, being on the '84 Giants 
(66-96). 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at us now. Everybody's having fun. The whole outlook of the club is 
awesome. It's funny. Well, it's fun is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The victory, aided by Benito Santiago's three-run homer in the sixth, also 
helped ease the emotional pain of Wednesday's trade, in which the Padres dealt 
Marvell Wynne and Luis Salazar for Schiraldi, outfielder Darrin Jackson and a 
player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't an easy night last night," Gwynn said. "There was some tears in 
here, particularly from the younger guys. Marvell was a pretty popular guy." 
</P>
<P>
The players understood, particularly considering that starter Eric Show (back) 
is on the disabled list, and Bruce Hurst (aggravated groin muscle) missed his 
last start. The concern is that the trade depleted the bench, particularly for 
left-handed hitters when third baseman Mike Pagliarulo starts. But that 
weakness could be shored up early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The player to be named likely could be left-handed-hitting first baseman Phil 
Stephenson of the Cubs' triple-A club in Iowa, Siegle confirmed. Stephenson -- 
of whom one scout on Thursday said, "Has a swing resembling that of Mark Grace 
and Wally Joyner but doesn't have the power" -- is hitting .301 with 12 homers 
and 60 RBIs and also has 26 stolen bases in 29 attempts for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson, 6-feet-1, 195, could be Clark's backup at first and also used as a 
pinch-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this club is still two, three players away from where we ideally want 
it to be," Siegle said, "but there's also no doubt in our minds that it's quite 
capable of winning the division, and maybe even more." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst, who missed a start because of an aggravated groin 
muscle, will make his next scheduled start Saturday against the Phillies. He 
pitched on the side Thursday and said that he experienced no pain. "I don't 
know if I'm 100%," Hurst said, "but I'm going to pitch like I'm 100%." 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: IN THE NFL, HE'S AGENT IN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has never thrown, caught or intercepted a pass, blocked a punt, kicked a 
field goal, made a tackle, recovered a fumble, laid a block or drawn a play on 
a blackboard. But he probably has as much input in the National Football League 
as anyone who ever did. 
</P>
<P>
When you think of an agent in sports, what comes to mind is a fast-talking, 
high-living, let's-do-lunch guy, probably in gold chains, maybe a fur coat, a 
guy with an instinct for the economic jugular, the modern equivalent of the 
snake-oil merchant, part fight manager, part faro dealer, dedicated to the 
proposition that talent is often distributed in inverse proportion to brains. 
</P>
<P>
They're very often loud, assertive, aggressive, not very likable people who 
look as if they would make noise eating soup. They come into focus with a phone 
in their ear, a secretary on their lap or a cigar in their mouth. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Leigh Steinberg. He's so preppie you find yourself looking 
around for Ali MacGraw. He looks a little bit like the way you'd imagine Percy 
Bysshe Shelley looked. The tousled hair, the pale brow, the gray-green eyes -- 
you figure he's going to burst into an ode to a skylark or a daffodil any 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
But he's more apt to start dreamily talking about $11 million for his client 
for four years. Incentive clauses. Guaranteed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Steinberg, the boy agent, has shredded more NFL defenses than Earl 
Campbell and O.J. Simpson on their best days. Only he does it with a fountain 
pen, not a football. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't set out to be an agent. He was a law student at Berkeley, student 
body president, when the resident campus hero, the Cal quarterback, Steve 
Bartkowski, was negotiating with the Atlanta Falcons. He asked Steinberg, who 
was studying contract law, to look over his shoulder at the bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Very nice," Steinberg was reported as saying. "But tell me, are you paying 
them or are they paying you?" 
</P>
<P>
Startled, Bartkowski allowed as how he was the payee. 
</P>
<P>
"In that case, let's look this over," Steinberg said, rolling up his sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
And another pro football legend was launched. 
</P>
<P>
When you talk of quarterbacks in pro football, you talk of John Unitas. When 
you talk of wide receivers, Cliff Branch. Linebackers are Dick Butkus. But 
agents are Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
He got Bartkowski the largest contract any rookie had gotten up to that time in 
the NFL. At one point last year, eight of the starting 26 quarterbacks in the 
league were Steinberg's clients. He represents 50 pro players in all, as well 
as 30 broadcasting talents, figure skaters, one professional soccer player and 
20 baseball players, among them San Francisco's Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
His methods succeed, he believes, because his merchandise is quality. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take a client until I have retraced his roots, questioned his 
colleagues, checked out his character and satisfied myself he has good, sound, 
fundamental values and I am offering a quality person," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg boasts that he has never had a client who tried to force 
renegotiation of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them I don't do renegotiations," he says, "unless the team initiates 
it. If (the athletes) want to renegotiate, I tell them to get someone else." 
</P>
<P>
He is insistent that his clients not be one-dimensional athletes -- or 
anchormen. 
</P>
<P>
"You owe something to the community which made you," he says. "We all do. If 
the athlete tells me he doesn't want to be a role model, I tell him, 'In that 
case, I don't think you should. Why don't you just play sandlot football the 
rest of your career and you won't have any obligations to anyone?' " 
</P>
<P>
His clients are notorious for giving back to the community. Steve Young, 
quarterback at San Francisco, gave $138,000 to his school, BYU. Will Clark 
contributes to the United Way for every hit he makes. Rolf Benirschke used to 
donate to the San Diego Zoo for every field goal he kicked. Gaston Green of the 
Rams kicked in with funds for his old high school, Gardena, as did Duane 
Bickett, Indianapolis Colt linebacker from Glendale, and Troy Aikman, who set 
up funds for his old high school at Henryetta, Okla., and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
They can afford it. Steinberg got Aikman $11.037 million for six years, a 
record for a guy who had yet to throw a pass in the pros. That's more money 
this year than Jim Kelly or Dan Marino will get, and almost as much as Joe 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the best Steinberg has done. He got Steve Young a $42-million 
deal with the old L.A. Express, a tab the defunct United States Football League 
is still paying off. He got Wade Wilson, a $250,000 quarterback at Minnesota 
last season, a $4.4-million four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
He likes to think he relies less on leverage and table-pounding threats than 
sweet reason. During negotiations for New England quarterback Tony Eason, who 
played only sporadically in two years, the Patriots' owner, Victor Kiam, asked 
Steinberg: "If you had an employee who had a nervous breakdown and hadn't been 
able to show up for work half the time in the past two years, would you even 
pay him?" 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg answered: "Mr. Kiam, this employee didn't get hurt on a skateboard in 
his driveway. This employee got hurt playing with reckless abandon for the New 
England Patriots. Now, if you had an employee who was digging a ditch for you 
and it caved in and injured him seriously, wouldn't you be obligated to pay him 
when he came back?" 
</P>
<P>
Eason got a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg reads defenses as well as anybody in the league. As one GM who dealt 
with him put it: "He's the No. 1 pick among agents. He can go long, he can go 
short. He sets you up for the run -- and passes. And vice versa. And he's never 
been sacked."

'89 YANKEES EVEN FALL SHY OF 1925 TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OWEN CANFIELD, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1925, Miller Huggins' New York Yankees were on their way to a seventh-place 
finish. At one point, the Yankees fell 18 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yankees of Manager Bucky Dent (well, at least he was manager when this 
newspaper went to press) repose 14 games behind the American League 
East-leading Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee fans may draw some comfort from that. But look closely. There is no 
comfort there. The '89 Yanks have equaled a record for futility, but they are 
by no means the equal of the '25 club. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
This Yankee team has descended to an intolerable position. It is duller than 50 
gallons of dishwater. Poor play and losing go in cycles. Eventually, the 
Yankees will be up again. But because of the tension, instability and panicky 
disorganization that exists throughout, it may take many years. 
</P>
<P>
But dullness is unforgivable in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanks of 1989 will avoid last place only because of the Detroit Tigers, who 
have died this season of natural causes. The Yankees have been murdered by 
their owner and their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 team finished 69-85. Yankee fans stayed away. After drawing more than 
1 million fans for five consecutive seasons, attendance fell to 697,000. But 
dullness was not a problem. Huggins was in the middle of an 11 1/2-year tenure. 
Before George Steinbrenner, a Yankee manager's position was relatively safe as 
long as he did the job. Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk all 
managed 10 years or more, although Houk's term was divided in two parts, ending 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between the Yankees of 1925 and 1989 is the difference between 
Miller Huggins and Bucky Dent. Huggins was tough, seasoned and in full command. 
Dent is hanging timidly around until the ax connects with his fully exposed 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yanks don't have hope. Isn't that awful? No hope. Only dullness and 
certain uncertainty. They lost 19-5 to the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 Yanks allowed 19 runs in a game, too, losing 19-1 to Detroit in 
mid-June. But they were only pausing to pull their feet out of the mud during 
that season and everyone knew it. In the next three years, they would win three 
pennants and two world championships. 
</P>
<P>
June 1, 1925 was a significant date for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that day that Lou Gehrig replaced Wally Pipp at first base. Some 
2,130 games later, the Iron Horse came out of the lineup. It was also the day 
Babe Ruth was inserted into the Yankee lineup for his first game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press ignored Gehrig but reported this on Ruth in The Courant on 
June 2: "In the clean-up position of the Yankees batting order again after 
almost two months' confinement to a hospital with influenza and indigestion, 
Ruth's opening successes were limited to fielding features." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Johnson was pitching that day for the first-place Washington Senators, 
who in October would lose the World Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth would play 98 games, hit 25 homers and drive in 66 runs in his curtailed 
season. That was expected. Gehrig had played 13 games for the Yanks in 1923 and 
10 in 1924. No one could forsee his magnificant baseball future when he 
replaced Pipp on that day. But in the ensuing 126 games he hit 20 homers and 
knocked in 68 runs, batting .295. Oh, these Yankees had hope all right. 
</P>
<P>
The next year they had a rookie second baseman, Tony "Poosh 'em Up" Lazzeri, 
who was ready. He played 155 games. Ruth hit 47 homers, Gehrig 16 with 107 RBI. 
Leadoff man Earle Combs had a solid season and the pitching, anchored by 
veteran Herb Pennock (23-11), was sound as a 1925 gold piece. The Yanks won 91, 
lost 63 and although they lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals and 
39-year-old Grover Cleveland Alexander, the dynasty was reestablished. 
</P>
<P>
The next season they won 110, and the next 101. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Yankees are sliding more and more rapidly backward. They have some fine 
players -- Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Bob Geren, Dave Righetti, Roberto Kelly, 
Jesse Barfield -- but they don't have hope. It is not a team that can hope for 
anything except avoiding the cellar this year, and little else next. 1990 will 
not be like 1926 for the Yankees. They don't have the weapons or the will to 
make the needed commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Too much trouble. Too much Steinbrenner. Too much dullness. Shame, shame, 
shame.

ZARAGOZA IS BIG WINNER OVER DUARTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the surprise of almost no one, Daniel Zaragoza of Mexico City battered aged 
warrior Frankie Duarte virtually at will Thursday night at the Forum and 
preserved his World Boxing Council super-bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Referee James Jen-Kin abruptly stopped the fight in the 10th round, after the 
34-year-old Duarte had taken a decisive beating. 
</P>
<P>
This one amounted to no more than a tough workout for Zaragoza, who earned 
$90,000. It was one-sided almost from the first bell. Seconds into the first 
round, the left-handed Zaragoza, in his fourth championship defense, rocked 
Duarte with a straight left hand that made Duarte wince. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to set the pattern for the fight. Duarte may have had the fortitude 
to overcome drug and alcohol abuse in recent years, but he never came close to 
overcoming Zaragoza Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, in what must surely have been his final appearance, never found the 
reflexes to counter-punch the busy Zaragoza. So when he was forced to resort to 
lead hooks and straight punches, Zaragoza, who weighed 121 pounds, successfully 
countered Duarte, 121 1/4 Round after round this went on, with Duarte offering 
only a pointless display of courage. Duarte's purse of $25,000 wasn't enough 
for this kind of beating. 
</P>
<P>
The boos began in the sixth round, and some spectators cheered when Jen-Kin 
stopped it at 1:54 of the 10th. Zaragoza was sailing on all three judges' 
cards, 90-80, 90-84 and 88-84. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Zaragoza is 39-4-1. Duarte, who turned pro in 1973, is 45-8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Had that been the only main event, the crowd of 6,342 might have thrown 
cabbages. But the show-savers were Paul Gonzales and Armando Castro, who, 
before the Zaragoza-Duarte sleeper, engaged in a 12-round war that wound up 
playing to a standing ovation and a shower of coins at the final bell. 
</P>
<P>
Castro is a former Mexican super-flyweight champion and a Zaragoza stablemate. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, the 1984 Olympic light-flyweight champion from Montebello, dominated 
the much shorter Castro over the first two rounds with superior boxing skills. 
But after Gonzales hurt Castro with a straight right hand in the third round, 
Castro began throwing punches wildly, and one of them, a big left uppercut, 
caught Gonzales on the chin, snapping his head back, and Castro got him again 
with a following right. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales reeled all over the ring, with Castro in hot pursuit. Gonzales, tagged 
repeatedly, survived the round but walked to his stool at the bell on wobbly 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
Castro rocked Gonzales periodically the rest of the way but never could put him 
in that kind of difficulty again. The rest of it was an exciting slugfest, and 
the best round was the fifth, when both little battlers traded their best 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was piling up rounds over the second half of the fight, and Castro, 
knowing this, began swarming all over him, often not even allowing Gonzales 
set-up time for his superb left jab. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were in outstanding condition and fought furiously over the last three 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The judges' cards favored Gonzales, 117-112, 116-110 and 117-110. Gonzales 
earned $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
In the third main event, Edgar Castro (no relation) of Miami stopped Ruben 
Castillo of Los Angeles in the fifth round. Castillo was taken out by a body 
shot in the fifth, and was later taken to Beverly Hills Medical Center on a 
stretcher for observation. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Dr. Robert Karns said: "Ruben suffered a contusion on his 
colon, on the right side of his bowl. At this time, we are not sure that he 
does not have a partial tear." Castillo was to remain in the hospital 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
After being stopped by Zaragoza, Duarte acknowledged that his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, when asked if he was through now. "But I had to give it a try, 
to prove everyone was wrong," he said. "In the gym, I was doing it -- I never 
looked better in my life. But tonight, I was out of whack. Nothing was working 
right. The reflexes just weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza indicated that his hands took a beating on Duarte's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting to knock him out," he said, "but after the fourth I had pain 
in both hands." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Duarte came out cautiously at the first bell, when nearly everyone 
expected him to come out throwing bombs. 
</P>
<P>
When Duarte caught Zaragoza in a neutral corner midway through the fifth, he 
hit him on the chin with a right hand. It was the only significant punch he'd 
thrown in the fight, to that point.

CLEMENS HAS 13 STRIKEOUTS IN 5-2 VICTORY

How times haven't changed: The Angels struck out 13 times against Roger Clemens 
Thursday night and lost to the Boston Red Sox, 5-2, leaving them 1-3 for their 
latest stopover at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
How times have changed: The Angels can't wait to get to Yankee Stadium, where 
they consider a four-game series against the New York Yankees to be a sorely 
needed chance to get well. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys are looking forward to seeing George Steinbrenner and Bucky 
Dent," was Angel first baseman Wally Joyner's droll assessment. "Hopefully, 
it'll be good. This trip, we've hit a couple of teams that were red hot. 
Unfortunately, we hit them at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, there's been no wrong time to hit the Yankees. The House of 
Steinbrenner is currently in disarray, with Sir George dumping managers and 
players and dropping the whole mess into the lap of rookie manager Dent. In 
Dent's 14-game tenure, the Yankees are 3-11, but only 2-8 in their last 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
After running into streaking teams in Kansas City and Boston during this 4-7 
trip, the Angels are desperately seeking any port in the storm -- and believe 
it can be found starting tonight in New York, although you won't get Doug Rader 
on the record about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to touch that with a 10-foot pole," Rader said when asked the 
Yankee question. "I'm not going to comment on that." 
</P>
<P>
Not for 10 more minutes and a dozen more questions, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
After the crowd in his office dwindled to a handful, Rader conceded, "There's 
no question in my mind that we need to win three out of four in New York. No 
question. That's imperative. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get through this road trip either a game above .500 or a game below 
for the trip. To do that, we need to take three out of four in New York. . . . 
If we do that, it'll put us in position to do something." 
</P>
<P>
By losing three out of four in both Kansas City and Boston, the Angels enter 
the month of September in a second-place tie in the American League West with 
the Royals, 2 1/2 games behind Oakland. Three wins in New York would leave them 
7-8 on their most strenuous test of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The series at Fenway got out of hand early, with the Angels facing two pitchers 
named Mike Smithson and Eric Hetzel in Tuesday's doubleheader and getting 
swept, the Red Sox outscoring them by a margin of 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
It took an implausible shutout by rookie Jim Abbott Wednesday night to avoid a 
four-game sweep, for Clemens was looking very much like Clemens in Thursday's 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
Bothered by elbow and shoulder soreness earlier in the month, Clemens held up 
through nine innings this time and seemed to get better as the game progressed. 
His 13 strikeouts were a season high, but most impressive was the fact that six 
of them came during the last three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought early on, we had a chance to get to him," Rader said. "He threw just 
fastballs until the seventh inning -- and not that it's hard to believe -- but 
I'd say it's unusual that we didn't generate more offense than we did. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, he started mixing in some breaking balls and he got tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (14-9) was especially tough on Lance Parrish and Jack Howell, the Nos. 
7 and 8 hitters in the Angel batting order. Back-to-back in the lineup, both 
struck out four times against Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Eight at-bats, eight strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was awesome," Howell reported. "What else did you think I'd say?" 
</P>
<P>
Parrish said he'd never seen Clemens throw any better. 
</P>
<P>
"He struck me out four times, so I would say so," Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
Let the record show, however, that the Angels had a lead in this game. Claudell 
Washington, the second man Clemens faced, homered into the right-field seats, 
giving Angel starter Kirk McCaskill a 1-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But before McCaskill could record an out in the bottom of the first, that lead 
had vaporized, with Boston scoring three times in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, Jody Reed (who ended the night with four hits), Ellis Burks and 
Mike Greenwell were the first four batters McCaskill (14-8) faced. Each of them 
produced singles, with Burks and Greenwell driving in runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox scored their third run on the first out of the inning, a force play 
on a Nick Esasky grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Heep singled home another run in the fifth, McCaskill's final inning, and 
a double by Reed and a sacrifice fly by Greenwell accounted for Boston's last 
run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels managed nine hits against Clemens, but only one more run after 
Washington's 11th home run of the season. That came on Tony Armas' RBI 
pinch-single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels might've had another run in the sixth, if Johnny Ray's motor skills 
had cooperated. First, Ray stood at home plate to watch a long fly sail down 
the left-field line and land fair, turning a double into a single. Then, Ray 
got caught in a rundown, turning a Joyner strikeout into an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
Rader didn't fault Ray for the rundown -- Ray was running on a full-count 
pitch, and Joyner is a high-contact hitter -- but had to wonder about the 
delayed reaction at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he thought it was gone, one of those elusive home runs," Rader said. "I 
didn't think it was worth bringing up at the time and I haven't addressed it 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably thought it was foul. That's certainly no excuse, but in the end, 
it had no bearing on the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ray: "I didn't even see it. I thought I fouled it back. That's basically 
what happened. I never picked the ball up until it hit the line." 
</P>
<P>
By then, it was too late, which is kind of the way most of this series went for 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Boston's done. Here come the Yanks. 
</P>
<P>
For once, the Angels can hardly wait. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels will add seven players from triple-A Edmonton today when major 
league rosters are expanded. In addition to catcher John Orton, already 
traveling with the team, the Angels will recall two outfielders, two infielders 
and two pitchers. The outfielders: Dante Bichette (.243, 11 home runs, 40 RBIs 
at Edmonton) and Max Venable (.271, 1, 45). The infielders: first baseman Jim 
Eppard (.274, 2, 34) and second baseman Mark McLemore (.244, 2, 34). The 
pitchers: right-handed starter Mike Fetters (12-8, 3.80) and left-handed 
reliever Sherman Corbett (6-7, 4.41, nine saves). All except Fetters have 
previously played for the Angels, Corbett appearing in 34 games with the 1988 
Angels.

IN A WORD, BORING;

<P>
EDBERG CULTIVATES CLASSIC LOW-KEY SWEDISH PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For years, people have wondered if there is anybody in tennis more boring than 
Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is probably not. Sure, like Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander before him, 
Edberg carefully cultivates the classic low-key Swedish personality, but his is 
even lower key. 
</P>
<P>
If Edberg works at it, which he often does, he can make his face as blank as a 
snowscape in his hometown of Vastervik. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Open a couple of years ago, Edberg was asked if he knew a joke. He 
said he knew a Norwegian joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did the Norwegian man carry a sheet of sandpaper into the wilderness?" 
Edberg asked. "Because he needed a map." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg slapped his knee and laughed. No one else did. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it seems, the joke is on us. Edberg has been bland on purpose all 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"My personality is to sort of sneak in the back door and be ignored," Edberg 
said here Thursday. "It's a tactic, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg continued moving along to a potential quarterfinal meeting with Andre 
Agassi in the U.S. Open when he defeated fellow Swede Peter Lundgren by the 
most boring score in tennis: 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Runner-up at both the French Open and Wimbledon, Edberg has found that being 
boring is good strategy. On the court, although not flashy, he is quick and 
decisive. He knows how to finish a point quickly with a serve and a volley. 
</P>
<P>
It's off the court that Edberg moves to Dullsville. 
</P>
<P>
When Edberg meets with reporters, he reveals little, unlike such talkative 
players as John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors, who have vastly different ideas about 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"You just answer a question and don't talk about everything else," Edberg said. 
"I've always been very neutral in my interviews. They're not something I enjoy 
doing. I'm not the kind of guy who loves going into press conferences." 
</P>
<P>
The sandpaper joke notwithstanding, Edberg sometimes shows traces of a fine 
sense of humor. But not very often. Typically, Edberg is to interviews what 
oatmeal is to breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a sampling of his exchanges with the press after he beat Lundgren: 
</P>
<P>
Question: What about Wilander losing? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I am not in that half of the draw. There are always upsets in every 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are your chances? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have to see how I do. It will be tough. I feel positive. 
</P>
<P>
That this isn't exactly lively reading couldn't mean less to Edberg. Tony 
Picard, his coach, said it's never been Edberg's style to be funny or quotable 
or controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just Edberg," Picard said. "You're never going to change him." 
</P>
<P>
At Wimbledon, John McEnroe said he recognized how Edberg was playing the press, 
but the 23-year-old Swede had never admitted such a tactic before. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, McEnroe answers one question and then he talks about everything else 
in the world," Edberg said. "I'm not like that." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Edberg had to pull out of an exhibition because of an allergic 
reaction. Picard blamed the reaction on detergent used to wash Edberg's shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I told him, maybe taking a week off was good," Picard said. "He's rested 
and came here keen." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg also came in wearing a new tennis shirt that isn't at all conservative. 
This one has a black pattern around the shoulders that dips raggedly in the 
front and back, as if someone had poured chocolate sauce on his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Edberg still wears a watch while he plays, probably to keep track of 
his next press conference and another opportunity to tell another Norwegian 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a million of 'em," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras took his telephone off the hook in his hotel room but couldn't get 
to sleep until 4 a.m. Thursday after having won the match of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just too wired," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old player from Rancho Palos Verdes defeated defending champion 
Mats Wilander in a five-set, second-round match that ended at 12:19 a.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who began playing tennis when he was 7, beat the No. 5 player in the 
world 11 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, ranked No. 91, wasn't given much of a chance. The U.S. Open program 
preview of his match with Wilander said: "Sampras is halfway between a former 
prospect and an average player. Wilander in three." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wilander lost, 5-7, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a really good player, but he's only 18 years old, and mentally I 
think he has to grow up a lot to be able to stay in the top," Wilander said. 
"Obviously, he can play some good tennis at times." 
</P>
<P>
The only other time Sampras had played a five-set match was at last year's Open 
when he lost to Jaime Yzaga of Peru. Sampras' third-round match will be against 
Yzaga. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope I can beat him this time and get myself motivated, so I don't have 
a letdown," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even thinking about beating Mats anymore," he said. "I'm just worrying 
about Yzaga. Yesterday is gone, and tomorrow is almost here."

U.S. OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
CHANG, AN EASY WINNER, IS ON HIGHER LEVEL THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During a rain delay before the start of his first-round match in the U.S. Open 
earlier this week, Michael Chang caught a glimpse on television of himself 
against Andre Agassi a year ago. He couldn't believe how much he had matured, 
both physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
After watching only a few points, he turned to his coach, John Austin, and 
commented: "What a difference. Last year, I just went out to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Chang is indeed different this year, as he proved in his 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 
thrashing of Sweden's Thomas Hogstedt in the second round yesterday. This year, 
the tennis may still be fun for the 17-year-old Chang, but as the reigning 
French Open champion and No. 7-ranked player in the world, it is also very 
serious business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the expectations are higher," he said. "I thought of myself at a 
certain level and going higher. But then the French Open came along and I just 
shot up to the higher level, and everyone expected me to play at that level all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
If Chang is a different person this year, then so is Agassi, who also had an 
easy win, beating South African Neil Broad, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis is clearly not as much fun for Agassi now as it was when he began last 
year's Open riding the wave of three consecutive tournament victories and an 
18-match winning streak. This year, he has yet to win a title and has recorded 
recent losses to such inauspicious opponents as David Wheaton, Carl-Uwe Steeb, 
Andres Gomez and Jim Courier. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attention here has been focused on such Agassi and Chang 
contemporaries as Pete Sampras, who upset Mats Wilander two days ago, and 
Courier, who will play Ivan Lendl in the third round. Both are promising young 
players. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Jimmy Connors, who turns 37 Saturday, rallied to defeat 
23-year-old qualifier Bryan Shelton, 6-7, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, and Lendl scored a 
snappy, 78-minute 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 victory over John Fitzgerald of Australia.

DITKA HAS GROWL FOR EX-BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latest dispatches from the Otis Wilson-Mike Ditka front: 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears' coach, whose team faces the Raiders in an exhibition 
Saturday, said he is taking the high road and never discusses his ex-players . 
. . but staged a five-minute detour when told that Wilson had said his Bears 
are not the dominating team they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Ditka Thursday, coming up only a few times for air: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, nobody ever gave him a Phi Beta Kappa award, did they? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't worry too much about what Otis observed. He better observe trying 
to make the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to sling shots, we'll sling shots. I'll put my record up against 
anybody's, including his. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have people who become disgruntled and take cheap shots after the 
fact, it's kind of interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"But consider the source. In everything in life, if you understand the source, 
you should have no problems. And that's why I have no problems with it, because 
the source is absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good player at one time. He was a very good player and he helped us 
win a lot of football games, but that had gone by him. Physically, he wasn't 
capable of doing what we wanted him to do, so we made a change, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
And Wilson's assertion that Ditka had long ago told him he intended to get rid 
of him as soon as possible? 
</P>
<P>
"If he said that -- it finally happened, didn't it?" Ditka said. "We ought to 
put it to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"The things is, fellas, you're trying to make something controversial. It's 
kind of silly. We're happy. We haven't talked about any of them (departed 
Bears). Evidently, they must not be too happy because they're talking about us. 
I don't understand it, myself. If they were happy, then this is the opportunity 
they wanted and they're at the place they wanted to be. They ought to keep 
their mouths shut and play football. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, I've never said a word because it doesn't bother us. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to believe everything a disgruntled football player says. 
C'mon. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm not going to be the guy who sits here and gives you something to write 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Darn. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, re-enlisted to discuss Ditka, said he couldn't understand what the fuss 
was about. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they're not a dominating team anymore," he said. "I would say the guys 
who were considered dominating, all of 'em, are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"They have, what, Richard (Dent), (Dan) Hampton, (Mike) Singletary left? 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of 'em were on the bench when we were there."

SANTIAGO HOMERS IN 5-1 WIN

Dennis Rasmussen pitched six no-hit innings, and Benito Santiago hit a 
three-run home run Thursday as the San Diego Padres downed Philadelphia, 5-1, 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, San Diego's seventh in eight games, pulled them within 6 1/2 games 
of division-leading San Francisco, which was idle, in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
To Rasmussen, the possible no-hitter and shutout were secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to play it one game at a time and win as many games as we 
can," Rasmussen said. "We've got a feeling in here that we didn't have earlier 
in the season. Nobody cares who gets the job done, as long as we win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen (8-9) retired the first 16 batters he faced before Dickie Thon drew a 
one-out walk in the sixth. The left-hander, who won for the fourth time in his 
last five decisions, lost his no-hitter in the seventh when Tommy Herr followed 
a leadoff walk to Len Dykstra with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Padre John Kruk followed with a single that scored Dykstra. Mark Grant 
replaced Rasmussen, retired the side and went the final three innings for his 
second save, allowing three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen would have been the first San Diego pitcher to pitch a no-hitter 
since the Padres joined the National League in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored in the second inning off Don Carman (4-15) on a double by 
Jack Clark and an RBI single by Chris James. Santiago followed one-out singles 
by James and Garry Templeton in the sixth with his ninth homer of the season, a 
drive over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Chicago 1 -- George Bell drove in three runs, two on a home run that 
extended his hitting streak to a club-record 22 games, as the Blue Jays moved 
into a tie with first-place Baltimore after a three-game sweep of the White Sox 
at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (14-8) allowed four hits in six innings, struck out two and walked 
two. Jim Acker followed with two hitless innings, and Tom Henke pitched the 
ninth to finish the combined six-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenberg (4-10) gave up five runs and nine hits in his second complete 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto came back from a one-run deficit with three runs in the bottom of the 
first inning. Mookie Wilson opened with an infield single and scored on Manny 
Lee's triple. Lee scored on Bell's ground-out to first base. Kelly Gruber 
doubled with two out, took third on Rosenberg's wild pitch and scored on Tony 
Fernandez' single. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 11, Baltimore 0 -- Joe Carter hit two home runs, and John Farrell 
pitched a five-hitter at Cleveland, dropping the Orioles into a first-place tie 
with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell (8-13) got his sixth complete game, striking out five and walking two 
in his second career shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Carter led off the fourth inning with his 27th homer, the first of five 
straight Cleveland hits off rookie Dave Johnson (4-3). Pete O'Brien and Brook 
Jacoby singled to put runners at first and third, and Cory Snyder and Brad 
Komminsk followed with RBI singles that finished Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, Carter hit a two-run homer off Dave Schmidt, giving Carter 
20 games in his career with two or more home runs. 
</P>

Kansas City 3, Detroit 0 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched eight innings, allowed five 
hits, struck out seven and walked none at Kansas City, winning his eighth game

<P>
The 97-day stay alone in first place ended swiftly and quietly Thursday night, 
with no sign of protest. 
</P>
<P>
On Manager Frank Robinson's 54th birthday, the Baltimore Orioles matched their 
worst loss this year and dropped into a first-place tie with the Toronto Blue 
Jays. John Farrell pitched a five-hitter, and Joe Carter hit two home runs to 
lead the Cleveland Indians to an 11-0 victory before 9,735 at Cleveland 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have company for a day, it's no big deal," said Robinson, who smiled 
and added, "We'll see how they (the Blue Jays) like it, then evict them. You 
know how lonely it is at the top." 
</P>
<P>
It was a night when "Magic" Johnson turned back into Dave Johnson, and allowed 
six hits and three runs in three-plus innings. Jamie Quirk's unbeaten record as 
an Orioles catcher fell to 4-1. The raging but rusty bullpen was pounded. The 
lineup that scares no one was stopped cold, extending the Orioles' scoreless 
innings streak to 17. 
</P>
<P>
It was their largest margin of defeat since June 30, when they lost to the 
Detroit Tigers, 16-5, and the most runs they have given up in a game since July 
13, when they lost to the Angels, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we'll sleep tonight," said Robinson of being blown out. 
</P>
<P>
In eight previous games with a lead of one game or less, the Orioles had won 
seven times and outscored the opposition, 45-19. But they couldn't muster 
anything against Farrell. So, for the first time since May 26, when they were 
22-21, the Orioles aren't alone in first place. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been saying things about us all year long," said Robinson. 
"Whenever things have looked a little bleak, people say, 'Uh oh, here they go.' 
Tonight's no exception. They'll be saying, 'This is it for them.' We'll see. 
I'm not concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell (8-13) was pushed up a day so he could start against the first-place 
Orioles. He must like three days' rest. He ripped through them, sending the 
Orioles to their 11th shutout this year. In the Orioles' last six losses, they 
have scored a total of five runs. They have been outscored in those games, 
45-5. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (4-3) just didn't have it. He got through the first three innings 
without much trouble, but Carter homered to open the fourth, starting the romp. 
Carter, who entered the game with one RBI in his last nine games, hit another 
homer off Dave Schmidt in the fifth. It was the 20th multi-homer game of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Chicago 1 -- George Bell drove in three runs, two on a home run that 
extended his hitting streak to a club-record 22 games, as the Blue Jays moved 
into a tie with first-place Baltimore after a three-game sweep of the White Sox 
at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (14-8) allowed four hits in six innings, struck out two and walked 
two. Jim Acker followed with two hitless innings, and Tom Henke pitched the 
ninth to finish the combined six-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenberg (4-10) gave up five runs and nine hits in his second complete 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto came back from a one-run deficit with three runs in the bottom of the 
first inning. Mookie Wilson opened with an infield single and scored on Manny 
Lee's triple. Lee scored on Bell's ground-out to first base. Kelly Gruber 
doubled with two out, took third on Rosenberg's wild pitch and scored on Tony 
Fernandez' single. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Detroit 0 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched eight innings, allowed five 
hits, struck out seven and walked none at Kansas City, winning his eighth game 
in a row, as the Royals moved within 2 1/2 games of Oakland in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen (17-5) has won 14 of his last 15 decisions. Jeff Montgomery worked 
the ninth for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City scored an unearned run in the first after Kevin Seitzer doubled 
leading off. With one out, Bo Jackson hit a grounder under the glove of Detroit 
first baseman Dave Bergman, and Seitzer scored on the error. Seitzer led the 
offense with three of Kansas City's six hits. Minnesota 8, Texas 6 -- Chip 
Hale's first major league run batted in broke a 3-3 tie and helped the Twins 
win at Minneapolis.

<P>

of the fifth. He added an RBI single in the seventh.

MARTINEZ PITCHES FOR MONTREAL, AND ALL OF NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the pitcher with a country on his shoulders, today will be the same as 
every other day on the road. He will labor beneath the weight. 
</P>
<P>
When Montreal's Dennis Martinez wakes up in his Los Angeles hotel, where he is 
staying with the Expos for their three-game weekend series against the Dodgers, 
he will notice the little things. The room will be cool. The sheet will feel 
fresh. The towels will fluff. 
</P>
<P>
But then the phone will ring. The voice on the other end will be speaking 
Spanish. The voice will call him El Presidente. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a local person from Nicaragua," said the most popular athlete and 
role model of that Central American nation. "Maybe I know him, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
"He will talk about pitching first. Then he'll talk about my country. About the 
problems, the poverty, the children. He will bring up this picture I have in my 
mind of how bad it has become." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez won't ask if the voice is a Sandinista or a Contra, for he claims he 
is neither. He will ask again about the children. 
</P>
<P>
The voice will inevitably wonder if Martinez is free for lunch at the kind of 
modest restaurant most ballplayers wouldn't even walk through. Martinez would 
accept, except he knows what is coming after he hangs up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"It will ring again, and again, and again," he said. "More families from 
Nicaragua. More of my people. I can't have lunch with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
If he can fit it around an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting -- he hasn't had a 
drink in nearly six years -- he will inevitably give in and meet some people. 
If they sound poor, he will dress casually, so as not to intimidate. After a 
couple of hours of talking about his homeland, he may leave with hurting heart 
and thinner wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Around mid-afternoon, he will set his mind to baseball and go to the park. But 
once there, particularly in Los Angeles, sometimes it gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, I feel like I am Fernando Valenzuela," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody will be waving a Nicaraguan flag. Many will still be there long after 
the game is over, waiting outside the clubhouse to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
So many voices, so little time. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I feel, 'I am so lucky,' " he said. "But I am also so sad." 
</P>
<P>
Teammates and opponents experience another feeling -- amazement, for despite 
this self-imposed burden, Dennis Martinez is having the best season of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
After his complete-game victory in San Diego Wednesday, Martinez is 15-4 with a 
2.92 earned-run average, 123 strikeouts and just 42 walks. Earlier this season 
he won 11 straight games, an Expo record and the longest winning streak by any 
pitcher in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this stuff he must go through, he has conquered all of it, and just 
look at him," Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said. "He's stronger than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Any story written about Dennis Martinez a couple of years ago might not have 
mentioned Nicaragua. The former Baltimore Oriole star had too many problems in 
his new country. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a sullen, moody Martinez was part of the Orioles' World Series 
championship in 1983, he drove his world apart. It was Dec. 23, 1983, not 
coincidentally the day of his last drink. 
</P>
<P>
After partying his way through a Monday night football game at a local health 
club, he was trying to drive home when his car had a flat tire. Police stopped, 
smelled his breath, and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
He spent much of the night in jail, then spent the next several weeks in an 
alcohol rehabilitation center. That period included Christmas and New Year's 
days, occasions that required his family to visit him, which forced him to 
accept reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I was powerless over liquor," he says today. "I finally understood -- I am an 
alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez started drinking in his hometown of Granada, Nicaragua, when he was 
15. When he came to the United States at 19, he drank to fit in. When he became 
the first Nicaraguan to make the major leagues at 21, he drank to ease the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, during a 1983 championship season that should have been the highlight 
of his career, he customarily set two bottles of wine on ice in his hotel room 
and spent the entire game thinking about running back to drink them. 
</P>
<P>
"The last weeks, I couldn't wait to leave the game to get back to that wine," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey, formerly Martinez's Oriole teammate: "We all 
knew something was wrong. He couldn't get along with anybody. We got in a few 
fights. He gave up on himself." 
</P>
<P>
During his rehabilitation, that changed. Martinez, the son of a heavy drinker, 
decided that his future could be better than his past. He decided that his life 
was too good to spend in a haze. 
</P>
<P>
He felt such a rush of good will, he has since decided to spread some of those 
feelings around. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized how blessed I have been, how wonderful and lucky my life has been," 
he said. "I needed to share that." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing affected was his career. Two years after being traded from 
Baltimore to the Expos in 1986, he went 15-14 last season with a 2.72 ERA. It 
was his most impressive season in six years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time he was getting set with the Expos, he began to seriously worry 
about home. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I don't care about Nicaragua because I don't even care about myself," 
he said. "Now, I realize my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Even when he was drinking, he would return occasionally to Granada, bearing 
gifts and riding in parades. But last winter in Miami, where he lives, he did 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Nicaraguan refugees there were sent to live in Bobby Maduro 
Miami Stadium until they could obtain work permits, a situation that attracted 
national attention because of the stadium's proximity to the nearby Super Bowl 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove over to see these people and it brought tears to my eyes," Martinez 
said. "I saw these people and I knew, this was my job. They were looking at me 
for help. I had to help." 
</P>
<P>
He understood that the refugees needed more than just food and clothing. They 
needed respect. 
</P>
<P>
So he brought them boxes of soap, toothbrushes, deodorant, toilet paper. From 8 
p.m. to 2 a.m. one winter night, he made deliveries. Once his hands were empty, 
he worked from his heart, visiting, talking, encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a touching, feeling thing," Martinez said. "I told them how, they had 
to behave themselves in this country, how they couldn't do everything their own 
way. I told them how, if I could do it, they could do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw how just being there, I lifted their morale. And they made me feel 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
He eventually returned to his home with the large bedrooms and swimming pool. 
But the work didn't stop. He became the manager of a local Nicaraguan sandlot 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
He also began working with the Nicaraguan Task Force Committee to help ease the 
refugees' transitions from the war fields to the U.S. workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"He has all these things to think about -- then look at his pitching record," 
marveled young Expo catcher Nelson Santovenia, also a Miami resident. "That 
shows you what kind of winner he really is." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez' biggest challenge, though, is yet to come. This winter for the first 
time since 1987, he will return to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
And he will be taking more than Christmas presents. He, his wife and four 
children will take food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a risk there, I know it," Martinez said. "There is a lot of bad, jealous 
people there. People are hungry. People know I have money. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get off the plane and there will be tanks. It is not the same as when I 
grew up." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the most important part of Nicaragua is the same. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still my home," Martinez said. "I go there by God's will." 
</P>
<P>
And the Expos' blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't try to stop him," Rodgers said softly. "You got to let a man do 
what's in his heart. And that's definitely in Dennis' heart." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers paused. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you worry about it, but what are we going to do?" he said. "I'm sure the 
(Pittsburgh) Pirates would have liked to have stopped Roberto Clemente making 
his trip down there too."

AT 70, ROBINSON ISN'T SLOWING DOWN IN CHASING ANOTHER GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Robinson doesn't dwell on records. In fact, other people place more 
significance on what he has accomplished than he does. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Grambling football coach improves on his record of 349 
victories over 47 seasons every time his team wins a game. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there's still another milestone obtainable -- if he cares to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
The late Amos Alonzo Stagg coached for 57 years, an impressive longevity 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to play it year by year," Robinson said. "My wife, Doris, hints 
that she wants me to give it up. However, she never lets a trip pass her by. 
She always has her bags packed. In earlier years, we didn't have enough money 
to afford her to go with me." 
</P>
<P>
Another trip is imminent when Robinson brings his Grambling State University 
team from Louisiana to the Coliseum Sunday to play Alcorn State of Mississippi 
in a game billed as the Los Angeles Football Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about records, the only true one is that I married my wife on 
May 21, 1941, and on Aug. 31 I became the coach at Grambling," Robinson said. 
"So I got my wife and my job at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Let's put 1941 in perspective. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was just starting his 
third term as President. Paul Brown was still coaching at Ohio State. Ram Coach 
John Robinson was only 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Robinson recalls that he was awed when he met Stagg at a coaching 
convention here in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited in a line that seemed a mile long to meet him. I was so impressed by 
him that I wondered if he had three eyes and three ears," Robinson said, adding 
that he was overcome emotionally when he was standing in front of Stagg. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson chuckled and said, "Another coach behind me said, 'Eddie, just kiss 
him and move on.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson arrived at Grambling at the same time the school changed its name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was done because of the cheerleaders," Robinson said. "Before they 
could say, 'Hold that line, Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute,' 
hell, the other team would score." 
</P>
<P>
Almost as impressive as Robinson's 349 victories, his team has had only four 
losing seasons since he began coaching. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943 and '44, Grambling didn't field a team because of World War II 
priorities. So he coached the Grambling High School team. 
</P>
<P>
One of his star players was Tank Younger, who went on to play for the 
university when the school resumed football in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Younger had a distinguished playing career with the Rams and is recognized as 
the first player from a predominately black college to play in the National 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
An administrator with the Rams, Younger says he still stays in close contact 
with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to him an average of three or four times a month for the past 40 
years," Younger said. "Everyone gets down on himself once in a while and, when 
I do, I call Eddie. Calling Eddie always gives me a lift. It was like therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Younger added that he has never made a major decision in his professional life 
without consulting Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"There are five men who have had a profound effect on my life," Younger said. 
"My father, my godfather, Dan Reeves (the late Rams' owner), Eugene Klein 
(former owner of the San Diego Chargers) and Eddie. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had a way of making people like him. He just had a way of 
communicating with people he coached." 
</P>
<P>
Younger said Robinson was a disciplinarian on the field and stressed that his 
players attend classes and graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is, of course, known for sending more than 200 players into 
professional football. An all-time Grambling alumni team would consist of such 
renowned players as Younger, Willie Davis, Buck Buchanan, Willie Brown, James 
Harris, Sammie White, Charlie Joiner, and Doug Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is proud of his former players' accomplishments, but he said there is 
even more satisfaction in watching them graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my players that if they play four years and don't get a degree they're 
the loser," he said. "I'll never forget what a thrill it was to see Dwight 
Scales (a former Ram wide receiver) walk across the stage at graduation 
ceremonies. He stopped in front of me in the faculty section and said, 'I got 
what I came to Grambling for, a pro football contract and a degree.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is a legend in his own time and he has no regrets about spending his 
career at the same school. 
</P>
<P>
He has had opportunities to leave Grambling and was even interviewed by Carroll 
Rosenbloom, the Rams' late owner, for an assistant coaching job in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a fine meeting, a serious talk for six hours," Robinson recalled. "He 
offered me a job and I said I would have to go back to Grambling and talk to 
some people. I remember him saying, 'Is that all you have to worry about?' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that Rosenbloom told him that some people would hate him by 
taking a legendary coach away from Grambling. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robinson decided to stay at Grambling, eventually breaking the record 
of 323 coaching victories held by Alabama's Paul (Bear) Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson seems puzzled, not bitter, that an NFL team hasn't hired a black head 
coach as the 21st Century approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the management and owners," Robinson said. "You can't tell a guy how to 
spend his money, but that's where it is. Whenever they decide, it will be done. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm really disappointed that pro basketball and baseball beat pro football 
to giving a black American an opportunity to have success, or fail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to happen, but it's just bad because it's such a great 
game. It really doesn't need that scar."

Pooh Richardson, who was a three-time All-Pacific 10 Conference selection from 
UCLA, signed a four-year contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves, the National

Greg LeMond, newly crowned world cycling champion and two-time Tour de France 
winner, agreed to a three-year, $5.7-million contract with a combined French 
team.

An international bidding war sparked by the most dramatic Tour de France finish 
in history has elevated LeMond to the same tax bracket as America's 
highest-paid baseball, football and basketball players.

NEW LOOK, NEW COACH; 
</P>
<P>
DOMINGUEZ HILLS SPIKERS TO OPEN SEASON SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills, which at times last year barely had enough healthy 
women to field a volleyball team, will have a new look this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros, who open at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at home against Biola, have a 
new coach and proven winner in Nancy Fortner, 11 healthy bodies and -- they 
hope -- a renewed sense of purpose and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
None of that may show up immediately in the won-loss columns, though. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lady Toros open the season, Fortner will have seen her new group play 
once, in a scrimmage this week. Although they should improve on last year's 
6-28 record, the inexperienced Toros, with only two seniors and one returning 
starter, figure to view this campaign as a learning experience and foundation 
for bigger things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dominguez Hills may come up short when California Collegiate 
Athletic Conference play begins and the Toros run into nationally ranked teams 
such as Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we'll be willing to play with a lot of hustle and work through things," 
Fortner said. "We've mostly been conditioning and doing a lot of teaching. I'd 
have liked to spend more time on drills but, hopefully, this will help later 
down the line. We have a good attitude and everyone's thinking real positive. 
We may start slower, but I'm hoping we'll get a little bit better each time." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner helped found the Dominguez Hills program in the 1970s, then spent seven 
seasons at Loyola Marymount, leading that program from its infancy to a West 
Coast Athletic Conference title and a victory over UCLA in the NCAA playoffs in 
1986. Her teams were known for overachieving, and Fortner was said to have the 
knack of developing a family attitude among teammates. 
</P>
<P>
She resigned after that season and has not coached for two years. Dominguez 
Hills is hoping she can bring the same kind of success to that struggling 
program, which has never been able to hold its own with the bigger CCAA teams 
that traditionally contend for the NCAA Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
At least Fortner will have more people to work with than her predecessor, 
Jennifer Gorecki, who resigned after last season. The team's ranks were so thin 
last year that at times, Gorecki had trouble finding six players to put on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Returning players include Karen Sutherland, who will be the team's top setter 
but will also double as a hitter; hitter Maria Romero, also a star on the 
softball team; backup setter Shawn Brunson, and Rachel Millan. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner got a late start on recruiting but managed to bring in community 
college transfers Julie Berthiaume and Sharlotte Fritzges, both from Antelope 
Valley, and freshmen Julie Martinovich from San Pedro High, Angie Hamer from El 
Segundo and Anne Salzman from Villa Park. Rounding out the team are Josie 
Gonzales and Lourdes Estrada, who redshirted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros are relatively short up front, with Berthiaume the team's only 
6-footer. 
</P>
<P>
In the CCAA, Northridge and Riverside are again the front-runners -- Northridge 
finished second in the NCAA championship last year after winning it in 1987 -- 
with Cal Poly Pomona and, possibly, Cal State Bakersfield providing a 
challenge. The Toros were 0-12 in the CCAA last year.

LOYOLA'S SPIKER COACH WON'T BUY TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On paper, the Loyola Marymount University women's volleyball team is too small, 
too young and too inexperienced to be much of a factor this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are coming off a 9-22 season, lost their two best players to 
graduation and open at 7:30 tonight at home against No. 1-ranked UCLA, so they 
don't figure to start an early winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
But first-year Coach Mike Normand, who gave the Loyola men's team a new look 
last spring, isn't concerned with how the team looks on paper. "I hate stats. 
I'm not a stat person," he said before practice this week. "There's a lot more 
to the game that doesn't show up in the stats." 
</P>
<P>
Normand not only coaches the physical and mechanical aspects of volleyball but 
the subtle parts of the game and the mental approach as well. He hopes that by 
stressing the positive and challenging the Loyola women to rise above 
expectations, he can produce a team that will surprise some opponents early in 
the season and challenge for a spot in the upper half of the West Coast 
Conference later. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lions will get their early tests: UCLA and Cal State Fullerton this 
weekend, then UC Santa Barbara, San Diego State and Cal State Long Beach -- all 
perennial top 10 teams -- leading to conference play in late September. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best way to do it," said Normand. "You test yourself against the 
best, then you can see what you need to do. If you strive (to improve), you 
reach those things. I thought the (tough) schedule would be a good test to see 
who wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Normand takes over a program that won a conference title and reached the NCAA 
playoffs in 1986 but slid for two seasons since under George Yamashita. The new 
coach, an All-American and later assistant coach at UCLA, is used to winning 
and is trying to sell his philosophy of being mentally and physically tougher 
than the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We've improved each day. I feel we will put ourselves in a situation to win 
some close games where, maybe, people (opponents) are better," he said. "We're 
gonna try to set ourselves up to be successful. We've got some good players." 
</P>
<P>
During training last spring, he told the women what he hoped to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were despondent after last season," Normand said. "I talked to 
them about my philosophy. It's been very positive. They responded extremely 
well. They've come back stronger than they left. They're giving their best 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Normand's basic philosophy is simple: "You need three things to be successful 
in life: 
</P>
<P>
- "The ability to overcome fear. Courageous people have fear but overcome it. 
Fear holds you back from being successful. 
</P>
<P>
- "The ability to overcome pain. Pain is different than injury. You have to be 
able to play with pain, including mental pain. 
</P>
<P>
- "The ability to believe in yourself and never give up on yourself. That's 
where most people fail. The athlete has to understand himself and have the 
discipline. Your top players keep going aggressively at it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, this is volleyball, not philosophy, and the team is basically new, so 
Normand is tailoring the attack to the talent and not setting unrealistic 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen players showed up for training -- four will redshirt -- and Normand 
expects to play nine or 10 regularly. Veterans include junior Stacy Trapp, a 
middle blocker and hitter; junior setters Anita Irwin and Loren Newman; 
sophomore middle blocker Laurie Jones, and outside hitters Tina Hammers, the 
captain, and Jennifer Kruse. Hammers and Kruse are the only seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry House, a 5-foot-8 outside hitter who transferred from Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, and junior setter Janiece Stimpfig, a transfer from Santa Monica City 
College, lead the newcomers. Others expected to contribute are outside hitters 
Katie Roberts and Raquel Glenn, both freshmen, and middle blocker Dana Bragado, 
another freshman and the team's only six-footer. 
</P>
<P>
Other returning players are junior middle blocker Dawn Moon, sophomore back-row 
specialist Shannon O'Kelly and sophomore setter Jenny Woods. Freshman Jill 
Sutton, an outside hitter, rounds out the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Conference race is uncertain this year, with Pepperdine looking 
like the favorite, returning four starters from last year WCC champ. Normand 
knows little about the other teams in the conference but said he prefers an 
approach similar to John Wooden: Worry about perfecting your skills and 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
One opponent, though, may prove an excellent gauge of Loyola this year: The 
Lions play highly ranked UC Santa Barbara at home Sept. 13, then in their last 
match of the season Nov. 21 at Santa Barbara. "That should show how much we've 
progressed," Normand said. "We're going to have an interesting year. We'll be 
stronger than last year."

FOOTHILL BOWING OUT AMID MISGIVINGS 
</P>

It is fourth and long. All the receivers are covered. And the Foothill League 
is about to be sacked. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one might say that the league already is "in the grasp." 
</P>
<P>
This is the final year of the Foothill League. Last April, Foothill-area member 
schools approved by a 26-to-16 vote a releaguing plan that will disband the 
league and place Burbank, Burroughs and Hart in a revamped, eight-team Pacific 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra, San Gabriel and Schurr, the Foothill League's remaining teams, will 
join Arcadia, Bell Gardens and Montebello in the fledgling Renaissance League. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and administrators from both the Foothill and Pacific leagues have 
appealed in vain to the Southern Section executive council to keep both leagues 
the way they are. Another appeal is planned in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a great reputation and a lot of tradition," Burbank Coach Randy Stage 
said of the Foothill League. "We don't want to lose the name." 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, however, any appeal is a Hail Mary pass. Southern Section 
Commissioner Stan Thomas described the prospect of a successful appeal as "very 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that, right now, it's done," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
And so, the league's swan-song season it most likely will be. And Stage, along 
with Hart Coach Mike Herrington and Burroughs Coach Butch McElwee, will say 
goodby to years of allegiance to one of Southern California's oldest and most 
competitive leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Stage, 33, entering his second year at Burbank, ran pass patterns through 
Foothill defenses as a wide receiver at Burroughs -- Burbank's archrival -- 
from 1970-72. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, 31, in his first season as coach at Hart, bucked and slugged in 
Foothill trenches as a member of the Hart offensive line from 1973-75. From 
1980-87, he roamed the sidelines during Foothill games as an assistant coach at 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
And McElwee, 42, entering his third season as coach at Burroughs, patrolled 
Foothill secondaries as a defensive back at Burroughs from 1963-65. 
</P>
<P>
All three, more or less, have the Foothill League in their blood. And they 
don't want a transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
"What's in a name?" Stage asked rhetorically. "But there is something in a 
name. What's the sense of tradition for these kids? A lot of people are proud 
to have played in the Foothill League and this is the last year. For someone 
who has only been in the league three or four years, big deal. But for Burbank 
and Burroughs. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank has belonged to the Foothill League since the league's inception -- 
which, according to some accounts, dates to 1927. Burroughs has been a member 
since the early '50s, and Hart, with the exception of a four-year stint in the 
Golden League from 1977-81, has been a member since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, who long had coveted the head coaching job at Hart, said that his 
allegiance is to the school first, the league second. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really care about the name," he said. "But I'd like to have it stay 
status quo. I think it's a good league." 
</P>
<P>
Herrington's attitude is understandable. In this decade, Hart has dominated the 
league, winning five consecutive titles from 1983-87 and Southern Section 
titles in 1983 and '86. Meanwhile, Burbank has not won a league title since 
1972 and Burroughs has not won since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which won 22 consecutive league games from 1984-88, is 78-27-2 in this 
decade and should rebound from last season's disappointing third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Who would want to leave a league in which your team is a proven power? 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of it," Herrington said. "But I like a six-team league. If we went 
in with the teams in the Pacific League, it would be more challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the new Pacific League, which will include Crescenta Valley, Glendale, 
Hoover, Muir and Pasadena, figures to be more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Muir (8-4) and Pasadena (7-4), co-champions last season, long have been area 
powers. Muir won a Southern Section title in 1986, flattening Antelope Valley, 
a Golden League power, 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
"A few teams will very seldom have a chance to go to the playoffs," McElwee 
said. "Muir is always going to go to the playoffs. Pasadena, right next door, 
they're always going to have a lot of kids. And Hart always has a lot of 
players." 
</P>
<P>
McElwee, in contrast to his colleagues, favors the new Pacific League over the 
existing Foothill League. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather get into the new league simply because there are rivalries," he 
said. "Our rivalries are with Glendale (area) schools. We don't have anything 
in common with Schurr. We don't have anything in common with Alhambra. From the 
kids' standpoint, they go out and play San Gabriel and they don't know who San 
Gabriel is. Even with the Pasadena schools, there is more of a rivalry than 
there is with Hart. I don't mind this league; we have always done well in it. 
But the rivalries aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
McElwee is no traitor. Rather, his allegiance is to the Foothill League of 
yesteryear. During the '60s, the league consisted of Glendale, Pasadena, Muir, 
Crescenta Valley, Hoover, Burbank and Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a bad league," McElwee said. "Muir never destroyed us. My senior 
year, they beat us 12-3. I wouldn't mind going back to the original Foothill 
League." 
</P>
<P>
Well, for the most part, he will be going back. As for this year, the Foothill 
League doesn't exactly figure to make a dramatic exit. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the league has been a showcase for talented players. Jim 
Bonds, quarterback at Hart in 1985 and '86, is now a UCLA sophomore. Former 
Hart offensive lineman Brian Jacobs, a 1987 graduate, and tight end Brian 
Allen, who graduated in June, also attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Barrett, who graduated in 1988 as Burroughs' career passing leader, 
attends Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Hart quarterback Rob Westervelt, who passed for 2,130 yards and 
21 touchdowns as a junior last season, appears to be the only proven marquee 
player. Seniors Dennis Rodriguez of Burroughs and Jeremy Sparks of Burbank both 
are inexperienced at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Hart senior tailback Howard Blackwell, who rushed for 850 yards and two 
touchdowns in 172 carries last season, is the league's premier ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is not going to be that good," McElwee said. "It's a little bit 
weak as far as having an overall lot of talent. In the past, you had the 
Bondses and Barretts and Allens. This year, they're not there." 
</P>
<P>
But the Foothill League -- and the honor of being crowned its final champion -- 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go out and play to the best of our potential and try and win 
it," Stage said. "And then wave 'Bye.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow: the Pacific League

CANYON SPURNS OFFER TO FACE SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading complaints from Golden League football coaches about the lack of 
willing nonleague opponents, San Fernando High Coach Tom Hernandez reported the 
following: The Tigers have three open dates on next year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez would gladly pencil in Canyon, which has won six league titles since 
1982 and all but one its past 35 league games. In a recent Times' story, Canyon 
Coach Harry Welch called the Southern Section league the "strongest in 
California" and complained that "people don't want to play us." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, whose team competes in the City Section, is not one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
"In a given year, they could probably beat us, but you'll never know until we 
play," he said. "We'd love to play them. We'll play them anywhere. We'll play 
them at College of the Canyons or Valencia Park or anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably don't want to come down here. They'd probably be intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez laughed heartily after that last barb, indicating that his challenge 
was good-natured. 
</P>
<P>
Welch took the challenge in that spirit but made it clear that there will be no 
Canyon-San Fernando game any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I looking to play the five toughest teams in Southern California, 
absolutely not," he said of his nonleague schedule. "Geez, I want more relief, 
not more misery. I'm not looking to add tough teams. I've already got them." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's preleague schedule includes such traditionally strong teams as Hart, 
Thousand Oaks and Mission Viejo. The Cowboys also will travel to Bakersfield 
and play Notre Dame, the second-ranked team in the Southern Section Division 
VII preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Welch has reservations about playing a team from the City Section, which 
doesn't field sophomore and freshman teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates scheduling problems for us," he said. "The freshmen have to have a 
bye, and their JV team has some juniors and seniors on it. When I mentioned 
that to the parents of our sophomore players, they got concerned." 
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line for Welch is the Tiger varsity -- the team and coach are 
too good, he said, adding that he coached Hernandez at Valley College when 
Welch was an assistant and Hernandez was an offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate his offer for a game, but I'm looking for some weak junior high 
team to play, not a San Fernando juggernaut," Welch said.

$303.2 million for 1989, up 2% over the previous year. Sales totaled $1.3 
billion, up 6%. In the fourth quarter, net income fell 25% to $50.4 million 
because of lower U.S. sales of Naprosyn as a result of additional competition 
from two new anti-inflammatory prescription drugs. Sales during the period 
slipped 3% to $321.1 million.

'THIEF' CLOSES CIRCLE ON '400 BLOWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he made "The 400 Blows" in 1959, Francois Truffaut wanted the film to 
contain a parallel story of a girl delinquent a few years older than his 
autobiographical 13-year-old hero, Antoine Doinel. Although he eventually 
erased her from "The 400 Blows," Truffaut apparently never obliterated the girl 
from his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he accumulated more material for the character of Janine, who 
was, according to letters in his recently published "Correspondence," based 
partly on the first woman he lived with when he was 17. A year before his 
death, Truffaut asked his close friend and co-scriptwriter, Claude de Givray, 
to work with him on the material, and at Truffaut's death, in 1984, a 35-page 
treatment existed. 
</P>
<P>
That passed to producer-director Claude Berri ("Manon of the Spring"), who 
chose director Claude Miller ("The Best Way," "Garde a Vue") -- in his earlier 
years an assistant to Truffaut as well as to Jean-Luc Godard -- to adapt the 
final screenplay and to direct it. (Miller's fellow screenwriters were his wife 
Annie Miller and Luc Beraud.) 
</P>
<P>
All this is prologue to "The Little Thief" (at the Royal), a fine, beautiful 
film, deceptively simple and marvelously subtle, which bears traces of both 
film makers' sensibilities. If it is a closing of the circle that began with 
Antoine Doinel, it may also be a first step down the road traveled with Janine 
Castang. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, to Truffaut's Doinel films, we will someday add one or two more in the 
Castang series by director Miller. He has already made one earlier feature with 
"The Little Thief's" remarkable star, Charlotte Gainsbourg, the 1985 
"L'Effrontee" ("Charlotte and Lulu"). 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of "The Little Thief" depends on your reaction to Gainsbourg, 
since the narrative rests entirely with her. Flat-nosed and thick-maned, with a 
look that is sullen or lost by turns, she also possesses a shy smile whose 
unfolding can twist the heart. Frankly, it took seeing the film twice to 
appreciate completely the delicacy and bruised sensibilities with which 
Gainsbourg invests Janine, a waif whose life is spent making excuses for the 
mother who abandoned her. 
</P>
<P>
We meet Janine in 1950. The postwar era is conjured up in a few seconds of 
newsreels: the giddy celebration after the liberation of Paris, the shaved 
heads of pretty Nazi collaborators, even now smiling defiantly for the cameras. 
Janine's missing mother was possibly one of those. Having "fooled around" with 
Nazi officers during the war, she has lit out, leaving her little daughter with 
an older uncle and his shrill younger wife in a poor provincial town that might 
be straight out of "Small Change." 
</P>
<P>
As though it were her due, Janine begins by stealing cash from schoolmates' 
lockers and graduates to boosting real silk panties, fox stoles and cigarette 
cases from unwary shopkeepers. It is, as we see poignantly enough, a clumsy 
attempt at badges of adulthood: All around her she sees Yanks and compliant 
French girls; what she sees in the mirror is not reassuring. For moral 
instruction, she has the local movie screen and a rudderless existence at home 
with her adulterous aunt and belittled uncle. (A nice detail is her rough 
uncle's skill at drawing, his real passion. He's a rich character, richly 
played by Raoul Billerey.) 
</P>
<P>
Caught after a brazen theft from the village church, she is given a chance: a 
job as a maid in a neighboring city. While working for this earnest, well-to-do 
young couple, the Longuets, she meets someone Truffaut may have intended as a 
harsh self-portrait: Michel Davenne (Didier Bezace), a 43-year-old married man 
who cloaks his pleasure in having a 17-year-old mistress in his virtue in being 
her teacher and "protector." 
</P>
<P>
One of "The Little Thief's" intricacies is in its even-handedness with so many 
of its characters: Janine's uncle; young Mme. Longuet; Michel. Simultaneously 
we see how Janine could charm this bookish provincial, how she would genuinely 
try to turn herself into his vision of her as a modest, accomplished secretary, 
and how a moment of real lust could blow this whole mentor/mistress game apart 
in a second. (The film is MPAA-rated R for adult themes.) 
</P>
<P>
It happens soon enough: Janine falls for the worst type. Do they not always -- 
didn't we all, at 17? The ferrety Raoul (Simon de la Brosse), roughly her age, 
is a would-be motocross competitor and a worse crook than she; he hasn't even 
mastered his movie shtick, flipping a cigarette into his mouth. And he brazenly 
blames his brief impotence on the fact that he needs two sheets, top and 
bottom, and a real bed, for a proper setting. 
</P>
<P>
But she invests all her starved feelings in his vision of grand passion; soon 
she's parroting his contempt for the straight life and a straight job and 
stealing for him on a grand scale. With what unfolds next, this could be as 
bleak a story as Agnes Varda's "Vagabond," yet it's not. Miller, with a 
delicate and magical touch, introduces cameras and photography into the 
equation, his own addition to Truffaut's text: if you wish, the "photography" 
that lured Truffaut into the world of cinema. Janine stumbles into it in the 
least likely place -- a Catholic-run girl's reformatory -- from a kindred, 
defiant soul, Mauricette (Nathalie Cardone, in the film's one searing 
performance). 
</P>
<P>
The freeze-frame conclusion of "The 400 Blows" was intentionally ambiguous but 
not promising. You cannot help but take heart as the road lifts at the end of 
"The Little Thief," and that amazing a cappella chorus that framed the opening 
credits reappears again with its cheeky marching song. (We know now it is the 
choral group Michel directs.) 
</P>
<P>
Things did not go swimmingly for Truffaut's first mistress; somehow Miller 
allows us to hope for more for Janine. We want to believe the film's text, that 
with her camera -- and in spite of her encumbrances -- Janine would steal 
nothing more than images in the future.

Cartoonist Jim Unger is taking a two-month leave of absence from his popular 
comic strip "Herman" for health reasons. During Unger's hiatus, the Universal 
Press Syndicate will distribute "classic releases of the panel in both its 
daily and Sunday formats," starting Monday. A one-panel strip with no recurring 
characters that depicts a skewed world of dumpy people, whiny little kids and 
obnoxious pets, "Herman" has twice been named "Best Panel Comic Strip" by the 
National Cartoonists' Society. "Herman" debuted in 1974 and currently appears 
in 400 newspapers in 24 countries, including the Los Angeles Times. ALEENE

Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti has been a no-show once too often at Chicago's 
Lyric Opera, and will sing there no more, opera officials said Thursday. 
Pavarotti had been scheduled to sing the role of Cavardossi in Puccini's 
"Tosca" on Sept. 16 to open the Lyric's 35th anniversary season but canceled 
because of a persistent inflammation of his sciatic nerve, said Herbert 
Breslin, his manager. This upset the people at the Lyric. "The Lyric Opera is 
now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti," 
general manager Ardis Krainik said, noting that the tenor has canceled 26 of 41 
scheduled appearances at the Lyric since 1981. "I love Luciano but because of 
the number of cancellations here I have no choice. I got to the point where I 
couldn't count on anything from him." ALEENE MacMINN

Oscar-winning actor Marlon Brando says he's made his last movie -- and it's a 
dud. "It's horrible," Brando said in Toronto of "The Freshman." "It's going to 
be a flop, but after this, I'm retiring. I'm so fed up. This picture, except 
for the Canadian crew, was an extremely unpleasant experience. I wish I hadn't 
finished with a stinker." Brando, 65, who has been shooting the movie in Canada 
for the last 12 weeks, also told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he's fed up 
with kowtowing to the Hollywood publicity system, detests New York and adores 
Canada. ALEENE MacMINN

HACKED-UP ADAPTATION FAILS TO MAKE 'CHORUS' A CUT ABOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scarborough, the English coastal resort city that is the setting of "A Chorus 
of Disapproval" (Music Hall and Esquire) -- and also the home of its writer, 
Alan Ayckbourn -- looks a lovely, eccentric place. Cold cliffs sweep to a paved 
esplanade, and the town is full of hilly streets that wind up between 
gingerbread houses, dingy pubs and Victorian hotels. In such a town, Alec 
Guinness, in a fey '50s comedy, might have wandered bemusedly, lamb to the 
slaughter for the flamboyant zanies inside. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Guinness, this hacked-up adaptation of Ayckbourn's wry play has 
Jeremy Irons, playing the befogged Guy Jones, haplessly seeking companionship 
in a Scarborough community production of "The Beggar's Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Guy is right: The theater is the place to meet people, the place where 
wallflowers become femmes fatales, wimps become superstuds. Though he has the 
aggressiveness of a lily pad and the sexual smolder of a pressed tweed suit, he 
soon tumbles into one adulterous amour with the director's neglected wife, 
Hannah (Prunella Scales, of "Fawlty Towers"), and another with voracious Fay 
(Jenny Seagrove), a woman who pumps undreamed-of lascivious metaphor into the 
word veal. 
</P>
<P>
Like many amateur groups, this one is riddled with good intentions, high 
hamminess and sexual intrigue. The director, Dafydd Ap Llewellyn (Anthony 
Hopkins), is a temperamental tyrant: a sentimental Welsh lawyer who throws 
tantrums with geyser regularity and seems less concerned with hearing the 
actors than playing to them, springboards for his weird, dreamy malice. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of a Robert Hamer or an Alexander Mackendrick -- a director in tune 
with classic British movie comedy -- to handle all this, "Chorus" has 
producer-director Michael Winner. Like Jack the Ripper, Winner has a crucial 
flaw: He likes to cut. 
</P>
<P>
From "I'll Never Forget What's 'is Name" to "Death Wish I, II and III," Winner 
has never been a man to shoot one set-up when seven will do. And Ayckbourn's 
humor depends on keeping his characters within a habitable universe, letting 
the action grow organically around them. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a bad actor in the cast but barely a complete performance. Seagrove 
has a nice, brittle lewdness, but Winner's camera seems so transfixed by her 
derriere, he reverses strategy and holds her shots too long. Irons is such a 
limp Guy that he seems capable of dribbling into the crannies. 
</P>
<P>
As Dafydd, the play's great part, Hopkins gives his most contorted performance 
since the Hunchback of Notre Dame, whose posture he almost duplicates. 
Scrunched-up, stiff-shouldered, roaring, whispering, rasping, Dafydd is a piece 
of spiced ham, burnt to a crisp. His melancholy eyes pop at you out of the 
charred lines. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that Winner the producer -- who's assembled a splendid cast, fine 
script and locations -- is so ill-served by Winner the director, who treats the 
play's wit like salami thrown into the slicer of his movieola. He's as 
shameless as Guy fingering his drawers. The material suggests the deft whimsy 
of "The Man in the White Suit" or "Tight Little Island." But the execution is 
just that: a slaughter. Winner keeps chopping off the heads of his scenes, 
battle-axing his actors. Behind every Ayckbourn on-target mal mot you can 
practically hear a directorial growl: "Arf a mo', mate. I like to cut!"

'42ND STREET' IN SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera opened "42nd Street" in June, the 
organization was just a kid. But when the show closes next week, Santa Barbara 
Civic Light Opera will have emerged as -- a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not a star -- civic light operas don't get that kind of publicity. 
But the Santa Barbara production of "42nd Street," the 1980 musical based on 
the 1933 movie about a chorine's big break on Broadway, is so crisply executed 
that it's easy to get carried away by its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
And there are statistics that support the notion that "42nd Street" is Santa 
Barbara Civic Light Opera's big break. The production has broken box-office 
records at the Lobero Theater, selling out virtually every performance. This is 
a well-drilled ensemble, directed and choreographed by Jon Engstrom, a member 
of the original Broadway company. For the extension of the show, which began 
last week (after a hiatus following the initial five-week run) Engstrom also 
plays the role of the choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Sherri Sperling Bannister sparkles as the kid who becomes an overnight 
sensation. Fred Lehto isn't as cynical as some of his predecessors in the role 
of the hard-driving director -- this guy really believes in Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Dougher and Carol Swarbrick are properly tart-tongued and 
full-throated as the prima donna and the wisecracking writer, respectively, and 
Kirby Ward is immensely likable as the company's fleet-footed leading man. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Wagner's set comes from the national touring company but a local 
costumer, Janice Martin, created 300 outfits (with a budget of $35,000). The 
look is almost as lavish as the original production's. Except for slight 
intonation problems early in Act II, Elise Unruh's musical direction is 
top-notch. 
</P>
<P>
 At 33 E. Canon Perdido, Santa Barbara, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., 
Sundays at 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., through Sept. 10. 
Tickets: $15.75-$17.25; (805) 963-0761.

STAGE BEAT: 'HARD TIMES' AT ANGELS; 'LIVING ROOM' AT CORONET; 'SICK PUPPIES' AT 
6470; 'OVER JORDAN' AT FRIENDS, ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studs Terkel's 1970 oral history of the Depression, "Hard Times," has become an 
evocative theatrical scrapbook at Company of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
It's a Friday-night companion piece to the company's acclaimed staging of 
"Waiting for Lefty," the 1935 rabble-rouser by Clifford Odets. First, "Lefty" 
fires up the audience; then "Hard Times" offers a wider context in which to 
understand the era that produced the likes of "Lefty." 
</P>
<P>
While "Lefty" generates more heat than light, "Hard Times" does the opposite. 
It's a thoughtful piece, in contrast with the feverish bombast of its 
predecessor. Together, the plays throw a formidable one-two punch at anyone 
who's ignorant of the past -- or complacent about the future. 
</P>
<P>
In "Hard Times," six actors speak the words of 26 of the people Terkel 
interviewed. The monologues are brief; the entire production doesn't last much 
longer than an hour. But Nanci Feldman's adaptation covers a lot of territory, 
from a young Pauline Kael remembering her college days at Berkeley, to hobos 
and the people who took them in, to farmers who faced foreclosure, to 
government officials who tried to cope with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The words are generally plain, but most of the reminiscences are rich in visual 
imagery and anecdotal value. The individuals are not identified as they speak; 
though their names are listed in the program, we don't know who said what 
unless we go to the book itself -- a step that many in the audience may feel 
inspired to take. 
</P>
<P>
The monologues have been woven together by director Nancy Oehlschlaeger with 
the right amount of often lyrical movement. The actors troop on stage as if in 
a bread line; later we see them jumping onto freight cars and wistfully waving 
goodby to adventurers who are going abroad. A chair becomes the campfire that 
drifters warm their hands around. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that the cast is all-white; Terkel's book wasn't. But each of the 
actors creates a variety of people, using different accents and simple 
off-the-rack costume changes to draw the differences among them. The cast 
includes Feldman, Linda M. Grinstead, Ruth M. Harrison, Howard S. Miller, Scott 
N. Stevens and David Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Fridays at 9:45 p.m. (following "Waiting for Lefty," 
which starts at 8), indefinitely. Tickets: $5 (or $3 if purchased with $10 
"Lefty" tickets); (213) 665-8989. 
</P>
<P>
'The Living Room' 
</P>
<P>
Producer Shelly Garrett is attempting to repeat the box-office success of his 
"Beauty Shop" with another raucous comedy aimed at black audiences: "The Living 
Room," at the Coronet. Unlike "Beauty Shop," this one wasn't written by 
Garrett; the writing and direction are credited to Charles Michael Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"Does a play have to make sense all the way through as long as people are 
entertained?" Garrett asked in a recent Times interview. Well, "The Living 
Room" doesn't make much sense. It doesn't have an ending, for example, relying 
instead on the laugh from the final cheap sight gag to distract audiences from 
thinking very much about the non-ending. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moore's script flirts early on with such subjects as joblessness, 
immigrant ownership of businesses in black neighborhoods and domestic violence, 
serious thoughts are quickly banished in favor of conventional gags about 
philanderers, an overweight housewife cutting loose, an upwardly mobile black 
woman putting on airs, a flamboyantly gay male secretary who has to baby-sit 
his boss's screaming child. 
</P>
<P>
The pivotal character is a mechanic (Lewis Dix Jr.), who returns to his 
depressed Michigan home town and finds himself torn between wooing his married 
boss (Bern Nadette Stanis) and returning to his ex, a snooty attorney (Lee 
Ellen Harrington). But the focus on the mechanic isn't very intense -- this is 
a loose, free-wheeling script. 
</P>
<P>
Critics (many of them black) who found the early black sitcoms to be shallow 
and stereotyped won't consider "The Living Room" to be much of an improvement, 
but it is an undeniably effective laugh machine for its target audience. 
</P>
<P>
 At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 
7:30 p.m. Tickets: $22-$25; (213) 659-2400. 
</P>
<P>
'Sick Puppies' 
</P>
<P>
Theatre 6470 is presenting three brief one-acts under the title "Sick Puppies" 
and the subtitle "characters in search of the cold, wet nose." The evening is 
preceded and tied together by videos, a cartoon and rudimentary sketches about 
the close relationships between people and their dogs. Directed by Jim Holmes, 
it doesn't add up to a big deal, but it is a stylish dash of droll and rueful 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kass' "Make Like a Dog" depicts a bored, childless couple who turn to 
dog-and-master games in search of a little excitement. Not surprisingly, they 
get more than they bargained for. Jonny Solomon and Jane Voigts play the couple 
as nebbishes with an edge. 
</P>
<P>
Voigts takes the stage alone in Jordan Crittenden's "Thursday Is My Day for 
Cleaning." It's mad-housewife time, with a surreal undertone. Voigts is a 
bundle of neurotic energy. Nick Flynn designed the slightly askew set. 
</P>
<P>
The set for "The Age of Pie," a parody of self-help groups, is too far back on 
the stage to make us feel as if we, too, are about to become victims of the 
psychological fascism that is the target of Peter Hedges' script. "Pie" has a 
few good ideas, but it's no more trenchant than a Groundlings sketch. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6470 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., until Sept. 
9. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Over Jordan' 
</P>
<P>
The Friends and Artists Theatre Ensemble, known for its revivals, has finally 
tackled a new, full-length play, Mark McNease's "Over Jordan." Actually this 
one seems longer, if not fuller, than full-length. It's an interminable 
talkathon, overwrought yet underdramatized. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the characters are rubes who have paid $500 to witness the appearance 
of an alien who speaks through a kindly, maternal channeler; they hope the 
spirit will deliver them from their earthly trials. After sitting through half 
an hour or so of McNease's excruciating dialogue, one can begin to identify 
with their yearning for an escape. But it was a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Delegall directed on a nicely detailed set by Robert W. Zentis. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Fridays through Sundays at 8 p.m., through Oct. 15. 
Tickets: $12.50; (213) 466-1767.

Sandow Birk makes surprising paintings using acrylic paint on black velvet. 
Surprising because they can be interesting, despite immediate associations with 
cheap Tijuana bullfighter pictures. Even though they lack Peter Alexander's 
aplomb in dealing with the same material, the calculated unease of the images 
holds our attention. It's a weirdly evolving mixture of street kitsch and 
Edward Hopper isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Birk uses velvet to mimic the light-absorbing canvas of night. He paints 
emotional darkness, as seen in artificially bright airport waiting rooms or 
speeding cars glimpsed in rear view mirrors. The paintings are gaudy with 
cheap-thrill tail lights and cobweb lamp effects, but it's a premeditated sort 
of tackiness. In sum they give the blurry but naggingly familiar sensation of 
being an alien in your own land. 
</P>
<P>
The work falls apart when it reaches too hard to tie a reason to all that 
disquiet. We don't need the row of empty vodka bottles lined up above a 
painting of an all night drive-through. Birk is strongest when he leaves the 
individuals to weave their own cocoons in cars and waiting areas, without 
extraneous props. 
</P>
<P>
Birk's night scenes contrast sharply with Ellen Adler's traditional still-life 
painting. Fruit on tilted tables pay heavy-handed homage to Cezanne, Manet and 
other Impressionist masters. It's the same old ground even if the glass bottles 
and apples with plates are nicely arranged and painted. A rosy hue mutes 
everything in pink. It's unclear if this is an intentional comment on fine art 
gone to seed as interior design or if Adler simply likes seeing things though 
rose colored glasses. (Earl McGrath Gallery, 454 N. Robertson Blvd., to Sept. 
8.)SUVAN GEER

"La Strada." Criterion, Extended Play CLV, 94 minutes, $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
Federico Fellini's classic film starring Anthony Quinn and Giuletta Masina has 
been reproduced on videotape for many years. But this laser disc edition 
reproduces the film experience like no other medium: the black-and-white 
picture is sharp and true and there are two clear audio tracks. The first 
offers the movie in its original Italian language; the second offers the 
English dubbing version. Subtitles are included as well. This way "La Strada," 
one of the great Italian classics, can be viewed as originally intended by the 
director in its original language or, for convenience, in its dubbed version. 
It's the way foreign films should be presented to the English-speaking public.

One of this year's most anticipated videotapes rolls into the stores this 
weekend -- with a Buick commercial attached. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the 1988 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor 
and Best Original Screenplay, "Rain Man" (MGM/UA, $89.95) is as outstanding a 
film as indicated by those Oscars (and a $160 million take at the box office). 
</P>
<P>
The premise is simple: two brothers -- one a self-centered hustler (Tom 
Cruise), the other an autistic savant (Dustin Hoffman) -- head cross-country in 
a car because one wants money and the other won't fly. (Note the similarity of 
that plot-line to another recent film, "Midnight Run"?) The screenplay, acting 
and direction (by Barry Levinson of "Diner" and "Good Morning, Vietnam") 
consistently fill the screen with details that are brilliant, true, funny and 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
More quality: "Wings of Desire" (Orion, $79.98, PG-13) is another fascinating, 
enigmatic work from German director Wim Wenders -- filmed partly in color, 
partly in black and white. Two angels come down to earth and meet Peter Falk in 
West Berlin. No, really! 
</P>
<P>
Somber and puzzling, "Wings" is worth sticking with for its many moments of 
ironic humor and mystic revelation. And if that weren't enough, there's also a 
performance by underground-rock singer Nick Cave that's so mesmerizing his fans 
may be tempted to buy rather than rent this tape so they can play it over and 
over. (Our tip: wait a few months for the price reduction.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "Wings" and "Rain Man," "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" (Nelson, 
$89.98, PG) didn't charm many reviewers, but teen-agers might find the silly 
premise righteously radical: Two teen guys travel back in time and meet 
Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln and lots of other weird dudes. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want a little more sophistication from their VCR, there's two 
more highly acclaimed foreign films: Eric Rohmer's "Boyfriends and Girlfriends" 
(Orion, $79.98, PG) and Jovan Acin's "Hey Babu Riba" (Orion, $79.98, R). 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you'd prefer old Hollywood movies, Turner offers each of these new 
releases for $19.98: "The Enchanted Cottage" (1944), a drama about the love 
affair of two disfigured people (Dorothy McGuire, Robert Young) that's flawed 
itself but is also unusual and fascinating; "Break of Hearts" (1934), a 
little-seen Katharine Hepburn drama; "The Last Days of Pompeii" (1935), which 
looks just like a DeMille film of the period, but isn't; "Holiday Affair" 
(1949), an overlooked Christmas movie with Robert Mitchum and Janet Leigh; and 
"Fighting Father Dunne" (1947), starring Pat O'Brien, cast again as a priest 
trying to reform bad boys, who weren't called "dudes" yet.

'JUST SAY MAO' BUCKS 'FORMULA' OF BILLBOARD ALBUMS' CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic

The weekly Top 30 CD sales charts in Billboard magazine generally contain 
pretty much the same albums that are found near the top of the trade 
publication's list of the week's overall 200 best-sellers, a ranking that 
includes vinyl, cassette and CD album sales. 
</P>
<P>
This has meant in recent weeks that one has found such familiar, mainstream 
pop-rock figures as Prince ("Batman" sound track), Tom Petty ("Full Moon 
Fever") and Richard Marx ("Repeat Offender") on both charts. 
</P>
<P>
But one album crept onto the Top 30 CD charts this month that is nowhere to be 
found on the overall Top 200 list: a compilation album featuring tracks by such 
new and/or largely unknown British and American artists as Nasa, Figures on a 
Beach, Danielle Dax, the Ocean Blue and Underworld. 
</P>
<P>
The album is "Just Say Mao," the third installment in a Sire Records series of 
budget CDs ($7.98 in most stores) designed to tempt adventurous fans into 
listening to these new Sire acts by teasing them with some rare, remixed or 
previously unreleased material by such label favorites as Depeche Mode, Lou 
Reed, the Replacements, Erasure and Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
Howie Klein, general manager of Sire and executive producer of the series, said 
the first album in the series only sold about 30,000 but interest has grown to 
the point where he expects this 17-track collection to top the 100,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend so much time (in the record industry) trying to convince radio to 
give our new groups a shot, and even then only a small percentage of new acts 
get anywhere the exposure they deserve," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
"So we thought we would bypass radio and try to go directly to the consumer 
with these promotional CDs. We put on a track by a band or artist the fan is 
familiar with and then follow it in most cases with something in the same 
vein." Among other artists featured in "Just Say Mao": L.A. rapper Ice-T, 
country maverick k.d. lang and Talking Heads' spin-off Tom Tom Club.

BEE GEES MOVE BACK TOWARD SOULFUL STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over time, pop music fans learn to be wary of artists who define themselves 
more by what they aren't than by what they are. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: the Bee Gees, who headlined the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Wednesday and Thursday. The Brothers ("Don't Blame Us for Disco, Please") Gibb 
have spent the better part of the last decade on the run from the white 
dance-music legacy they left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that such songs as "Stayin' Alive" and "Jive Talkin' " were among 
the most memorable in the Bee Gees' 22-year repertoire of hits and handily came 
to represent an era. 
</P>
<P>
Said era, the late '70s, spelled e-m-b-a-r-r-a-s-s-m-e-n-t for the boys, who 
subsequently attempted to distance themselves from their unwanted disco-king 
thrones by removing most of the R&amp;B from their music -- a misguided move if 
ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
But if Donny Osmond can have his sins forgiven (or forgotten, more like it) by 
the teeming masses, then anyone can, and the Bee Gees are on the upswing of 
what looks like a commercial comeback after a nearly decade-long drought. Is 
this because of or in spite of their "Saturday Night Fever" heritage? 
Wednesday's slick, solid show, their first local appearance since a Dodger 
Stadium gig 10 years ago, held some clues. 
</P>
<P>
Hesitantly, they're beginning to put a little soul back into their style. A 
little. The currently rising single "One" is a mild mid-tempo charmer with a 
nice, slinky, subtle groove, and stood out as one of Wednesday's early 
highlights. It's likely that its slight but definite R&amp;B tendencies 
(lacking on most of the new album of the same name) are what is helping make it 
such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it's not the content. Lyrically, the album "One" is a veritable 
stream of meaningless non sequitur cliches. Take a line like "If love is like 
an ocean, I'll surely drown" from one song and replace it with a line like "My 
love is as strong as oceans are far apart" from another, and the switch would 
hardly make a wave of a difference in the bland wash of either number. But this 
is not exactly a new setback for the Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
No, what character there is in the Bee Gees' canon has been almost entirely 
vocal. As always, Barry Gibb's distinctive vibrato ably carried the lead on 
most of the selections Wednesday, with Robin's more clear and delicate-sounding 
tenor a nice second choice. As always, Maurice provided the all-important third 
harmony voice but sang only a bit of lead. During "Holiday," he made a cute, 
self-deprecatory joke out of constantly stepping up to the microphone, only to 
remember that he has no part at all in that oldie and step back again. 
</P>
<P>
The trio of female backup singers on hand (including the estimable Phyllis St. 
James) was almost superfluous -- and overqualified for the job. Their role was 
to in some small way bolster the brothers' already strong harmonies; only in a 
few instances, as in "How Deep Is Your Love," could the women clearly be heard 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Vox alone do not legends make, and many memorable tunes were resurrected, 
largely in a low-key mid-set medley that included such now rarely heard (even 
on oldies radio) early songs as "Have You Seen My Wife, Mister Jones." 
</P>
<P>
But though a foot-stomping version of "Lonely Days" came close, the only songs 
to get most of the crowd enthusiastically on its feet were the closing quartet 
of funk-and-falsetto disco hits: "Stayin' Alive," "Nights on Broadway," "Jive 
Talkin'," "You Should Be Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion was that these were saved for last not because they're particular 
favorites of the Gibbs -- in fact, their delivery seemed the most perfunctory 
of anything in the show -- but because they're the most energetic in the 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
This audience was, obviously, a biased one, but the wild reaction to those 
numbers that the Gibbs seem to find such an albatross should send a message to 
the brothers: Come back, be black, all is forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the show with a nod toward the largely fortysomething crowd were the 
Nylons, a talented yet somehow supremely irritating "rockapella" quartet. The 
expert nostalgia peddlers' all-vocal (plus occasional drum machine) versions of 
'60s pop classics fell flat time and time again. Their ability to take a hit 
like "Up on the Roof" and turn it into a drag of a choral dirge was something 
remarkable. The a cappella concept promises something organic and rich, but 
they're really closer to their namesake product.

Thunderstorms battered the north-central part of the nation, flooding streets 
in northern Minnesota and dumping hail the size of golf balls in North Dakota. 
More than 9 inches of rain fell at Callaway in northwestern Minnesota, the 
National Weather Service said. Nearly 4 1/2 inches was reported at Park Rapids, 
while 3.25 inches fell at Aitkin and about 2.2 inches at Fargo-Moorhead. Storms 
produced 2 inches of rain in 20 minutes at Moose Lake, where flooding was 
reported, the weather service said. In North Dakota, up to 3 inches of rain 
fell between Jamestown and Fargo. In Mapleton, an inch of rain fell in 15 
minutes. Level wind patterns and a warm front contributed to the formation of 
the thunderstorms, forecasters said.

CROWDS FILLING STATE PARKS

The three national parks in Central California are already filling for the 
Labor Day holiday, the last long weekend of the summer. Officials in Yosemite, 
Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said they expect all three to be filled 
by midday today. "Anyone without reservations for a camping spot, tent, cabin 
or hotel room will have to leave the park at night," said Lisa Dapprich, a 
National Park Service spokeswoman in Yosemite. "We still have a few campsites 
on a first-come, first-served basis, but they'll be gone by Friday morning." 
Officials in Sequoia and Kings Canyon reported similar conditions and said they 
expect the parks to be heavily used by holiday crowds during the three-day 
weekend.

A bridge being built over a major Baltimore-Washington artery near Laurel, Md., 
collapsed during rush hour as workers poured its concrete deck, trapping 
several motorists beneath debris and injuring 14 people, authorities said. 
Kimberly Anderson of Elkridge, who was listed in critical condition with 
multiple injuries, was one of five commuters in two cars that were caught under 
a hail of wet concrete, metal and wood on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. 
None of the other victims, including nine construction workers, had serious 
injuries, authorities said.

More than 10,000 Poles roared their approval as Lech Walesa joined them to 
celebrate the ninth anniversary of the birth of Solidarity and pray for the 
success of the new Solidarity-led government. Solidarity, the East Bloc's first 
independent trade union, emerged this year from more than seven years of 
banishment. "We reject the road of violence and revolution, but we have the 
right to use legal measures," Walesa told the crowd in Gdansk, where the union 
was born in 1980.

The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear the case of accused serial killer 
Charles Ng, moving the former U.S. Marine a step closer to extradition to 
California to face 12 murder charges. Ruling without comment, the high court in 
Ottawa rejected Ng's request to appeal an extradition order handed down by an 
Alberta judge. Ng still can appeal to the Justice Minister. Ng, 28, is wanted 
in connection with the sex-torture slayings of 12 men, women and children in 
Northern California. Eleven of the deaths involved sex slayings at a rural 
cabin in Calaveras County in the Sierra. The 12th involved the death of a San 
Francisco disc jockey. Ng is also wanted on kidnaping and burglary charges.

NEW PILOT LICENSE RULES GO INTO EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New regulations designed to make it easier and less expensive to learn to fly 
went into effect over the objections of federal air safety regulators and the 
Air Line Pilots Assn. The new rules permit the issuance of a so-called 
recreational pilot's license after only 30 hours of flight instruction, 
compared to the 40 required for a regular license. A recreational license will 
permit pilots to fly only within 50 miles of the airport where they learned to 
fly. They may fly only in the daytime and in clear weather and may not use 
airports with traffic control towers. John Lauber, a member of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said the board has long opposed the new license. 
"I do wonder how they can adequately enforce the many restrictions that have 
been put on," Lauber said.

Rival forces in Cambodia are attacking each other's supply lines as a prelude 
to more intense fighting after the failure of the Paris peace talks, a Thai 
military spokesman said. Lt. Gen. Narudol Dejpradiyudh said Thailand had 
deployed extra artillery along its eastern border with Cambodia in case 
fighting spills over. Narudol said Cambodian troops were launching attacks near 
refugee areas "to cut contacts and supply lines" between civilian supporters 
and the rebels. At the same time, rebels were attacking troop areas, he said.

Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam said that his government would soon 
open peace talks with rebels in northern Tigre province, but hours later he 
said the Tigre People's Liberation Front had launched a new offensive. "While 
we are talking about peace, the . . . guerrillas in Tigre . . . launched an 
unprovoked all-out offensive against government forces," said Mengistu, who 
interrupted a parliamentary session to make the announcement. The rebels have 
been fighting since 1975 to topple the Marxist government. But a rebel 
spokesman in Washington said that the Ethiopians launched the offensive and 
were "suffering heavy losses."

BATS TAKE OVER OLIVENHAIN TOWN HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just around dusk, Bob McAndrews says, you can see them fly from the old Town 
Hall into a darkening sky -- their furry bodies diving about herky-jerky, like 
distressed planes with a blind pilot at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out at night in search of food and water," said McAndrews, the 
Olivenhain Town Council president. "As soon as they can fly, their mothers 
refuse to feed them. 
</P>
<P>
"So they strike out on their own. It's been said each one can eat more than 500 
bugs an hour flying about the night. Well, I believe it. Just look at all the 
droppings on the floor of the Town Hall and see for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
For the past few months, officials in this Encinitas community, have been 
confounded by a creepy conundrum -- what to do about the hundreds of bats that 
have taken up residence in the rafters of their rustic, 95-year-old Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Can Hear Them Twerping' 
</P>
<P>
"If you stand in the right spot, you can hear them twerping all day as they 
sleep," McAndrews said, calling attention to a cooing noise. "And the smell! 
How would you like to smell this stuff all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers say the bats have been a presence for years inside the redwood hall, 
which was built in 1895 by German settlers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, hall users began noticing more and more bat 
droppings -- known as guano -- covering sections of the wooden floor like a 
sticky sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
Officials even installed a lowered ceiling to stop the droppings from 
bombarding people who used the A-frame hall for gatherings such as 4-H Club 
get-togethers, weddings, and Halloween and Christmas parties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bats Were Rabid 
</P>
<P>
Then, in early summer, Town Council members found several dead and injured bats 
on the floor of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Tests later showed that several of the bats were rabid, according to Dr. Hubert 
Johnstone, a San Diego County veterinarian. Though only a dozen of 97 bats 
tested last year were rabid, those sickly ones can pose a health hazard, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when McAndrews and other town officials knew they had a problem. They 
didn't even know how many bats they had, rabid or not. And the county health 
department told them that state law prohibits the spraying of chemicals to kill 
the creatures. 
</P>
<P>
So, who were they going to call? 
</P>
<P>
"We called in bat experts from the city, county, you name it," McAndrews said. 
"We had some powerful people here, including Dr. Denny Constantine, a bat 
expert from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"He crawled around inside the hall attic and gave us at least one answer. He 
said we had evidence of hundreds of bats living here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home for Baby Bats 
</P>
<P>
Experts told Olivenhain officials their Town Hall was home to a nursing colony 
of baby bats, mainly of two varieties -- the Mexican free-tailed and the big 
brown bat. 
</P>
<P>
"They crawled inside little holes all over this place," said McAndrews, a real 
estate appraiser who himself has become a sort of armchair bat expert, 
consulting studies and charts. 
</P>
<P>
"These little creatures can even squeeze through a quarter-inch crack. There 
was no way to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
But the coming of fall may provide a solution. The Mexican free-tailed bats 
soon will begin migrating south for the winter. And officials have a little 
surprise for the others who stick around. 
</P>
<P>
One upcoming evening, when the bats leave at twilight, officials plan to 
hastily erect a wire mesh screen over the holes. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, they can fly off, but they can't get back in," McAndrews said. 
"Then, they'll have to go somewhere else, maybe the church nearby or the belfry 
in the old hotel across the way there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Fatal Bat Removal 
</P>
<P>
Some bat enthusiasts hope there's a positive ending to Olivenhain's bat drama 
-- including Martin Schuler, a member of Bat Conservation International and one 
of the experts called for consultation. Schuler says his group often offers 
advice on how to rid residences of bats without killing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Bats are beneficial," said the General Dynamics lab technician, who for 17 
years has made bats his hobby. "They eat insects, and they pollinate plants 
like the agave," a family of plants, varieties of which are used to produce 
tequila and mezcal. 
</P>
<P>
"But, for some reason, bats have gotten a bad rap," Schuler said. "Maybe it's 
because they're secretive. They're always seen at night. People think they're 
associated with the devil. And the Dracula movies haven't helped. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Most modern fears, he said, revolve around rabies. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabies cases are extremely low, however, maybe 50 bats out of 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bats Can Be Disconcerting 
</P>
<P>
Few hall users have shrieked in terror, McAndrews said, but the bats have 
disconcerted some of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids will freak out when they see a June bug. But sometimes during a 4-H 
meeting, someone might open a door and be startled by a bat flying in or out." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, most clubs -- even the town council -- have moved elsewhere, 
to nearby homes or pizza parlors. And attendance has dropped as a result. 
People, McAndrews said, want their Town Hall back. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel pretty possessive of this place," he said. "They call me 
at home just to tell me somebody is parked outside. They want to move back in." 
</P>
<P>
When the bat problem is solved, officials say they can start using a $136,000 
state Department of Parks and Recreation grant to begin renovations on the 
venerable building, which McAndrews said has been declared a California 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace of Mind 
</P>
<P>
But there's another reason to get rid of the bats. And that's peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard the horror stories when we were kids," McAndrews said. "You 
know, stuff about walking around at night with a fire to light your way. If you 
weren't careful, they said, bats attracted by the light could come swarming in 
and cover your hair. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of stuff always stayed with you." 
</P>
<P>
County veterinarian Johnstone said that even rabid bats pose little problem 
unless uncautiously handled. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common way people get injured is by picking up a bat they think is 
dead and not knowing the little guy has enough life left in him to bite," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, animals will carry them into the house like mice. One time a bat 
carried into the house crawled into bed with the owner that night. He was just 
seeking a little warmth, that's all." 
</P>

FEAR FOR CARRIERS' SAFETY HALTS MAIL TO HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To ensure the safety of mail carriers, the U.S. Postal Service said Thursday 
that it had temporarily stopped mail delivery to residents of a 558-unit 
low-income housing project in Long Beach after two gun-toting men scared a 
letter carrier earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier was not injured or threatened, but she immediately returned to the 
post office after the two suspected gang members carrying handguns ran past her 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"She was visibly upset," said area postal manager Raymond Aguillard. "The 
carrier feared for her life. If they had started firing, it could have hit 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of the Carmelitos Housing Project in North Long Beach are also 
upset, but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, they complained of being "walled in" when school 
administrators erected a 10-foot concrete wall between the project and 
adjoining Lindbergh Junior High School, where teachers and students complained 
regularly of hearing gunshots. Two years ago, a student playing after school 
was hit in the chest by a stray bullet and nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the residents questioned whether a wall was the answer to battling 
high crime in the area. Now, they say, they are being inconvenienced because of 
postal officials' reaction to Monday's incident, and they still don't see 
additional police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was blown out of proportion," said Dorothy McAleavey, president 
of the Carmelitos Awareness Committee, a tenants' organization. 
</P>
<P>
But postal officials said their reaction was consistent with their policy to 
halt deliveries any time they feel there is a danger to a mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Circumstances 
</P>
<P>
"We curtail mail when there are dogs on the route," explained postal service 
spokeswoman Kay Behnke. "But it is not a frequent occurance." 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials said they are working on alternatives, including the 
possibility of centralizing all the mail boxes near the Carmelitos 
administration office. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, beginning today, residents will be able to pick up their mail 
at the management office in the project between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Since 
Monday, residents have had to pick up their mail at a nearby post office. 
</P>
<P>
McAleavey complained that the new arrangement would inconvenience residents who 
work and those who are disabled. Aguillard said special arrangements could be 
made for people who can't pick up their mail in the day, but he could not 
provide specifics.

NANCY REAGAN DROPS SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED DRUG CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Reagan has formally withdrawn her support of a proposed Los Angeles drug 
treatment center to be operated by Phoenix House and asked that 200 donors who 
pledged $5 million to the project be given the opportunity to transfer their 
donations to her own Nancy Reagan Foundation, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major disappointment to us," said Chris Policano, spokesman for 
Phoenix House in New York, a private foundation that operates a variety of drug 
programs across the country. "There had been no prior dissension. It was a 
surprise; let me leave it at that. . . . But she has changed her mind. And that 
is her decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House, meanwhile, has sent letters notifying donors of Mrs. Reagan's 
wishes but informing them that the foundation believes that it has a legal 
obligation to use the money for a drug treatment center somewhere in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scope of Program 
</P>
<P>
However, Policano said, the scope of the program would undoubtedly be 
"narrowed" because of the organization's loss of the Nancy Reagan name as a 
fund-raising asset. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said in an interview Thursday that Mrs. 
Reagan believed that she was "spreading herself too thin" because she was doing 
so much work with her own foundation, her upcoming book and charitable work on 
behalf of cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"She felt she couldn't get the drug center done properly," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Mrs. Reagan believes should happen to the money raised for the 
center, he said: "Mrs. Reagan believes it is up to each donor to decide what 
should happen to their donations." 
</P>
<P>
However, the law may not allow contributors to re-channel their donations once 
given, according to an opinion Phoenix House requested of the California 
attorney general three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some of those donors would have preferred to transfer to her (Nancy 
Reagan's) organization," said Carole Ritts Kornblum, the assistant attorney 
general who rendered the opinion, in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's all history. It doesn't matter. . . . I don't think there's any 
legal obligation on the part of Phoenix House, which received gifts, to forward 
them to any other charity," Kornblum said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Decision 
</P>
<P>
Policano said that to date, only three contributors have asked that their 
donations, totaling $65,000, be returned or transferred. No decision had been 
made as yet as to what would happen with those donations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The former First Lady announced in May that she was withdrawing her support for 
the proposed site for the center in Lake View Terrace because of opposition 
from homeowners there. A source close to Mrs. Reagan said she told Phoenix 
House officials informally shortly after that discussion that she would be 
dropping her support of the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
However, Policano said a staff aide to Mrs. Reagan did not notify Phoenix House 
until Aug. 8 that she would no longer lend her name or fund-raising powers to 
the proposed treatment center and that she "was going to use the Nancy Reagan 
Foundation as the base of her post-White House efforts." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the notification, he said, the board of directors drafted a 
letter that it sent to more than 200 donors who had contributed about $2.8 
million in cash and made another $2.2 million in pledges to "clarify the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
The letter informed donors that Mrs. Reagan's change of heart "was a costly 
one." 
</P>
<P>
More than $600,000 had already been spent on the Lake View Terrace project. The 
funds were used to purchase an abandoned hospital that was to have been the 
site of the drug treatment facility and develop the program there, the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me point out that the directors of Phoenix Houses of California were 
willing to make so large an investment . . . because of iron-clad assurances we 
had received from Mrs. Reagan, her advisers and aides," said the letter, which 
was signed by Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House Foundation 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, The Times learned, the Nancy Reagan Foundation 
formally requested -- and received -- permission to withdraw another $3 million 
from a permanent endowment at the Community Foundation of Greater Washington 
Inc. to fight substance abuse. Mrs. Reagan had helped raise the funds during 
her years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds for Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg said Mrs. Reagan's understanding was that those funds "were always for 
her to continue her anti-drug abuse campaign, and once the (Nancy Reagan) 
foundation was established, then the funds were made available so her work 
could continue." 
</P>
<P>
However, Dick Snowden, chairman of the board of the Washington foundation, said 
in an interview that the board was under no obligation to honor such a request. 
It agreed to do so after first ascertaining that the new Nancy Reagan 
Foundation would distribute the funds according to the wishes of the donors. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden said the question of what would happen to the funds was "never spelled 
out" when it was set up in the early 1980s. The contract under which the fund 
was established called for it to be an ongoing endowment from which the 
foundation board would distribute funds with the advice of Mrs. Reagan, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nancy Reagan Foundation requested return of the funds last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board wrestled with it, but it didn't wrestle too hard," Snowden said. 
"There was opposition in the sense that, frankly, our greatest concern was that 
during the time the fund had been here, not as much money had stayed here in 
Washington as we would have liked and we had expected." 
</P>
<P>
He said the board's debate also centered on the fear that if the funds had not 
been released, then future first ladies or other officials might be hesitant to 
deposit funds there. He said no other such endowment has been transferred. 
</P>
<P>
The Nancy Reagan Foundation is considering 40 requests for grants from drug 
prevention and education programs around Southern California. A celebrity 
tennis tournament is scheduled for Oct. 7 to raise more funds for the 
foundation.

<P>
When Jose Gaspar showed up for football practice at Belmont High School, he had 
more than a few doubters. At age 17, Jose weighs all of 104 pounds. Ask him how 
tall he is and he shrugs, smiles and says, "I don't know." He does not seem to 
think it is an important statistic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it has given him a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"Get up here, Too Short," a coach orders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys have Ed (Too Tall) Jones, a 6-foot, 10-inch defensive end. 
The Belmont Sentinels have Jose Gaspar. In cleats, Too Short might be 5 feet 
even. Or he might not. 
</P>
<P>
He is summoned to "The Pits" and handed the ball. In this drill, Too Short is 
mano a mano against Stanley Carranza, a 14-year-old freshman. It's a fair match 
up: Stanley himself is 5 feet, 3 inches and 105 pounds. It's Jose's job to get 
past Stanley and Stanley's job to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Too Short!" a teammate calls out. "Do it, Too Short!" shouts another. 
</P>
<P>
Jose breaks right -- he's quick -- and there is the crunch of helmets and 
shoulder pads. Legs pumping, he gains a yard, maybe two, before Stanley steers 
him to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
147 Students Try Out 
</P>
<P>
The glory, if it comes at all, comes in the fall. But for players, football 
season begins during the dog days of summer vacation. Jose and Stanley are just 
two of 147 students giving it the old high school try at Belmont near downtown, 
the state's largest secondary school with more than 4,300 students, mostly 
immigrants. In Los Angeles County, home to more than 180 high schools, 
thousands of boys are out for football. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% drop out during conditioning drills -- three weeks of endless 
push-ups, sit-ups and wind sprints. Those who survive are rewarded with "Hell 
Week," the first practices in helmets and pads. At most schools, "Hell Week" is 
a grueling ordeal of two-a-day practices -- a period that helps coaches 
separate players by ability and character. Year-round schools such as Belmont, 
able to have only one practice a day, are given two weeks to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its size, Belmont is no powerhouse. Last year, the varsity won four 
games and lost six. As for their chances this year, "Hope springs eternal," 
says Coach Rob Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Will Warm Benches 
</P>
<P>
Winning is not the only thing at Belmont. For many, in fact, practice will be 
the only thing. Several players will go the full season, the coaches say, 
without playing a single down. 
</P>
<P>
What players get from football, Leavy says, is "a sense of belonging." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody gets cut for lack of size, only for poor grades or gang membership. In 
the neighborhoods around Belmont, gangs go by such names as Rockwood, 
Headhunters, Echo Park, Rascals, Crazy Riders, Big Top, Diamond Street and 
Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach says, 'This is our gang. You belong to any other gang and you're out,' " 
one player explains. A few players are "gang-bangers," the player confides, but 
they're quiet about it. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few will score touchdowns or make the big tackle. At Belmont, 53 players 
are assigned to varsity and junior varsity, and 93 are on the "B team," made up 
essentially of the younger, smaller players. Each team is allowed only 11 
players on the field at a time, which means that scores of Sentinels will be 
bench warmers. Nobody likes to sit on the bench, yet only a few quit. The 
common denominator is desire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determined to Play 
</P>
<P>
Joe Alviar, a 17-year-old, 120-pound defensive end, didn't play a single down 
last year but is determined to play this year. "That's why I came out. . . . I 
didn't want to waste all that time out there running last year," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Palomares, a 14-year-old freshman, is a 5-foot, 2-inch, 104-pound running 
back and a Belmont High legacy. His older brother, Jesse, was a star running 
back from the Class of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try the hardest I can, but not make any promises to myself" about 
playing, Alex says. "It's not how big or how small you are, it's how much you 
want it." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mario Serrano, a Belmont graduate now playing nose tackle for 
San Jose State, came to practice one day to give a pep talk about football and 
the classroom. When Serrano started out on Belmont B team, he weighed 130 
pounds and could bench-press 200, Coach Leavy recalls. Now Serrano weighs 235 
and presses 400. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Happy 
</P>
<P>
The littlest football player in the biggest school has earned the respect of 
his teammates. Born in Guatemala, Jose Gaspar is a shy English-as-a-second 
language student. He tried playground basketball, "but I wasn't good enough." 
One of seven children, Jose says his parents are not worried about him playing 
such a violent game. "They're happy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates remember when Jose first showed up in the weight room. Some people 
laughed, they said, because the weights he placed on the barbells were so 
small. 
</P>
<P>
One month ago, Jose was bench-pressing 85 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's up to 130.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM MENENDEZ LED PLANS INTERNAL PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still reeling from the murder of its chief executive, Live Entertainment Inc. 
of Van Nuys announced Thursday that it has hired a New York-based law firm to 
conduct "an internal review" into the death of Jose Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment executive Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were murdered in 
their Beverly Hills home Aug. 20 by two people using 12-gauge shotguns, law 
enforcement sources say. Some sources see the double homicide as the work of 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police, who are investigating the murder, have declined to 
comment on the case and have announced no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison 
said the internal inquiry was not "a murder investigation" and would not 
duplicate efforts of Beverly Hills police. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to learn as much as possible about what happened," attorney 
Richard Borisoff said. "We have no idea if it was an organized crime hit or it 
wasn't."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE BID TO POLL 'STALKER' JURY DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Thursday denied a defense motion seeking to 
interview the Night Stalker jurors about their ability to continue deliberating 
the fate of defendant Richard Ramirez in the wake of the murder of a fellow 
juror more than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
To interrupt jury deliberations at this point -- on the 12th day -- "would 
probably be a fatal mistake," said Judge Michael A. Tynan. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the jurors appear to have gotten over their grief after the 
slaying of Phyllis Y. Singletary. She was found shot to death in her Carson 
apartment on Aug. 14, apparently the victim of a domestic quarrel with her 
boyfriend, James C. Melton, who later committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan agreed with Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan S. Yochelson, who argued 
that to interview jurors now would be tantamount to "jury tampering." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be heard on Tuesday are arguments on another defense motion seeking to 
disqualify the jury, largely on the same grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies stemming from a 
series of nighttime residential burglaries throughout Los Angeles County, 
mostly in the spring and summer of 1985. He was arrested four years ago 
Thursday, and could face the death penalty if convicted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECORD NUMBER OF EXOTIC INSECTS FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Record numbers of exotic insect pests are showing up in Los Angeles County and 
posing an unprecedented threat to California's $16-billion farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being literally swamped," said Rosser W. Garrison, a county 
entomologist. "The variety of insects is increasing, and the sheer number is 
increasing." 
</P>
<P>
As of July, Garrison has counted 1,185 potentially harmful insect pests foreign 
to California, ranging from scores of fruit flies to devastating gypsy moths, 
fire ants, Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles and a variety of mealy bugs 
and scales. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of quarantine reports that I have to do are higher than ever 
before," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached epidemic 
proportions in Southern California and is racing for the state's agricultural 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has become a magnet for imported insects for a number of reasons, 
not least of which is the mild climate and the ease of international travel, 
officials said.

CREMATORY OPERATOR UNEXPECTEDLY PLEADS GUILTY, DRAWS 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena crematorium operator who had long maintained his innocence of grisly 
charges that he mutilated corpses, conducted mass cremations and stole dental 
gold from bodies unexpectedly pleaded guilty to 21 charges and was sentenced to 
five years in prison, prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Sconce, 33, appearing before Pasadena Superior Court Judge Terry 
Smerling, also pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of hiring thugs to beat up 
three competing morticians, failing to bury the remains of a baby girl and 
stealing a 1985 Chevrolet Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Sconce, who already has been held two years in Los Angeles 
County Jail, will probably serve no more than 10 months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faced 11-Year Sentence 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office had opposed giving Sconce the 
chance to plea-bargain his case, maintaining that he should have been sentenced 
to the maxiumum 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't concur and we didn't come up with the agreement," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Nancy D. Aronson, a co-prosecutor in the case. "I personally thought he 
should have been given the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the objections, Smerling approved the agreement with Sconce, ending a 
major portion of the 2 1/2-year-old case. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce still faces seven felony counts, including charges that he bribed 
witnesses to lie in court and tried to hire someone last year to murder Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis, who was then handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
But as part of the agreement Wednesday, Judge Smerling told Sconce that he 
could plead guilty to those charges and receive no additional prison time, 
Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not totally unhappy with the outcome," Aronson said. "Here's a guy who 
has been pleading his innocence all this time and now he pleads guilty. It 
certainly saved the taxpayers and everyone a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Sconce's attorney, Guy E. O'Brien, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
There is still a possibility, meanwhile, that the Ventura County district 
attorney's office will file murder charges against Sconce in connection with 
the death of Burbank mortician Timothy Waters, who died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Ventura County coroner's office believed his death was due to 
natural causes. During court hearings last year, however, witnesses testified 
that Sconce had bragged about poisoning Waters. 
</P>
<P>
A new autopsy was performed and traces of deadly oleander poison were found in 
Waters' blood and tissue samples. His death was reclassified as a murder and is 
under review by Ventura County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The labyrinthine case of Sconce and his cremation operation began in the high 
desert city of Hesperia on Jan. 20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce owned a small corrugated steel building that neighbors thought was being 
used to manufacture ceramic panels for NASA's space station project. They were 
puzzled by the putrid odors that occasionally emanated from the site at night. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving several complaints, Hesperia fire officials entered the 
building. They found barrels of human ashes and bone, along with several 
partially cremated bodies loaded "like cordwood" in kilns at the unlicensed 
crematorium, one fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce and his father, Jerry Sconce, were arrested the next week. His mother, 
Laurieanne Lamb Sconce, was arrested later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Institution 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were startling not only because of the nature of the discoveries, 
but also because the Sconces operated one of the oldest and most respected 
funeral homes in the area, the Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Sconces were eventually charged with 68 felony and misdemeanor counts. The 
most grisly concerned removal of body parts for sale to a scientific supply 
company and theft of dental gold from bodies, a procedure that former employees 
said was called "popping chops." 
</P>
<P>
Other charges included embezzling funeral trust accounts, commingling cremated 
remains and falsifying death certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the charges were dismissed after the preliminary hearing last year 
and 27 more counts were dismissed by Smerling in June and July, although 
prosecutors are appealing those dismissals. 
</P>
<P>
Laurieanne Lamb Sconce still faces 18 felony and misdemeanor counts and Jerry 
Sconce eight counts, Aronson said. Their trial is tentatively scheduled to 
begin in October.

BULLDOZED INTO HOMELESSNESS; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN NOW SLEEPS OUTDOORS AFTER LONG BEACH KNOCKS DOWN HER HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Morcom lives on the streets now. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong resident of Long Beach, Morcom can be found lurking in the alleyways 
or rummaging through the trash cans of one of the city's most affluent 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Looking unkempt in old sweaters, she sometimes uses a beat-up shopping cart to 
deliver firewood to nearby residents. Often she sleeps under the stars in one 
of the area's choicest vacant lots -- a parcel with an ocean view that local 
real estate agents say may be worth $465,000. 
</P>
<P>
Morcom owns the lot. Until last week it contained her house. But then the city 
-- ignoring her pleas -- bulldozed the structure and made her the most 
celebrated homeless person in Alamitos Heights. 
</P>
<P>
In a neighborhood where homes sell for as much as $1 million, Morcom now 
receives her mail in a makeshift mailbox stuck in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Long Beach Department of Planning and Building say Morcom's 
small two-story house -- built entirely of cedar in 1904 -- was a substandard 
building in such poor and unsanitary condition that it endangered the lives and 
health of its inhabitant and her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Morcom described it as a historical gem that she was in the process of 
restoring. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area, to whom Morcom's house had long been a familiar 
landmark, are sharply divided on the matter. While some applaud the city's 
action, calling it long overdue, others say it had much more to do with rising 
property values and Morcom's eccentricity than with issues of health or safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She's Been Railroaded' 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted her property," said Faye McDowell, a neighbor who has known Morcom 
for 16 years. "She's been railroaded. I think it's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Simpson, a music store owner who lives two doors down: "I'm happy 
with the city's action. The house was not habitable, (except for) maggots, rats 
and dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Morcom's slide toward last week's confrontation with the bulldozers did not 
occur overnight. It developed over many years as the neighborhood evolved from 
a barren oil field into a booming real estate market dotted with increasingly 
expensive dwellings that dwarfed the tiny abode on Winslow Avenue in East Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Morcom -- who will not reveal her age except to say that she was born in the 
late 1940s -- said she was conceived and raised in the cedar house, which her 
family had owned since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who remember her as a child say she seemed to lead a fairly normal 
life until the 1968 death of her father, who she said was once a city engineer. 
Morcom's mother died six years ago and ever since, she said, her life has been 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Morcom said, she has lived without gas or 
electricity. Unable to hold a regular job after a brutal mugging left her 
partially disabled, she claims to have survived largely by selling wood, often 
speaking of the Bible to would-be customers. 
</P>
<P>
And, moved by the plight of beings less fortunate than herself, Morcom said, 
she had made her home a haven for stray dogs and disabled war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, Morcom's frequent confrontations with the city 
began about 10 years ago when neighbors began complaining about the overgrown 
weeds on her property. The complaints intensified and, in 1986, the city 
declared the house substandard and hazardous, ordering her to improve its 
condition or face having it demolished. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition was so abhorrent that it just defies description," said Eugene 
Zeller, the city's superintendent of building and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Structural problems, he said, included the lack of a proper frame, inadequate 
roof, unsafe electrical system and outmoded plumbing. In addition, he said, the 
house was infested with rats and littered with debris and animal feces, 
creating a major public health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an obligation to abate substandard or dangerous conditions," Zeller 
said, "and this house was a threat to life, limb, safety and public welfare." 
</P>
<P>
Retaining a lawyer, Morcom was able to stave off the wrecker's ball for some 
time by obtaining a series of extensions from the city and temporary 
restraining orders from the court. 
</P>
<P>
Each time, said attorney Doug Otto, who lives in the neighborhood and 
represented her without pay, Morcom promised to improve the condition of her 
property to the city's satisfaction and to eliminate the unsanitary conditions. 
Otto said he even set up several meetings for her with contractors willing to 
do the work and financial institutions willing to issue low-cost loans to pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
Morcom, he said, broke every promise, failed to show up for almost every 
meeting and continuously rebuffed his best efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"She wouldn't cooperate," Otto said. "The city bent over backwards to prevent 
the demolition of her house, but it was like I was trying to help her and she 
just wouldn't let me." 
</P>
<P>
Morcom has consistently denied that the condition of her house was as bad as 
the city said it was, but just as consistently refused to allow anyone inside 
for inspection. She also denied being uncooperative, saying that she was making 
satisfactory progress toward restoring the house and, given time, would have 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated and discouraged, Otto withdrew from the case last week. On Aug. 24, 
the bulldozers arrived to do their work in front of a stunned horde of 
neighbors, a job for which the city plans to bill Morcom. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officials said they found more than 20 dogs on the premises, 
most of them suffering from mange. As a result, they plan to ask the city 
prosecutor's office to charge Morcom with cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Morcom's belongings -- including a brass bed, antique piano, books and an 
assortment of old tools -- were hauled to a city storage yard. She has 30 days 
to claim them before they are taken to a dump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agents Move In 
</P>
<P>
At the sight of bulldozers, Morcom became hysterical and was taken to 
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center where she was detained 24 hours for psychiatric 
observation. While still hospitalized, she was contacted by the first of many 
real estate agents seeking to represent either her or a buyer in the sale of 
her lot. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has left a bad taste in the mouths of some neighbors, who think 
that real estate is what the controversy is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"These people could give a blank about anything but their own property values," 
said Neal Fox, a furniture mover who considers himself one of Morcom's best 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
But those who complained to the city disagree, including the owner of a 
4,500-square-foot house next door that is about to close escrow after selling 
for a price purported to be close to $1 million. While their property values 
have certainly been enhanced by the destruction of the old house, the owners 
said, their motivation for reporting her was the dogs and the rats. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw rats crawling on her windows," said the homeowner, speaking on 
condition that she not be identified. "Our main concern was for our health." 
</P>
<P>
The rats are gone now as Morcom haunts the neighborhood, collecting her 
firewood and storing the few remaining scraps of her possessions in area 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned neighbors recently built her the mailbox attached to a stick on her 
property so that she could receive official mailings, particularly the city's 
bill for the more than $5,000 it has spent on demolition and storage. If Morcom 
doesn't pay the bill, officials said, the charge will be attached as a lien on 
her property, which could eventually force a sale. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like Vietnam," the woman said. "I'm a refugee in my own country." 
</P>
<P>
But recently she found a green marble ashtray in the rubble that caused her to 
smile. And when she had a brief opportunity to retrieve some belongings, among 
the items she chose were two old shovels and a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I've got something to build with," she said tearfully. "Do you think 
it's crazy to want to start again?"

JULIAN'S WATER CONTAMINATED; WARNING ISSUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With autumn and Apple Days just a few weeks away, the mountain community of 
Julian was hit with the second water warning of the year this week. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Health Services served notice to Julian residents and 
visitors not to drink the water after benzene was found during routine testing 
of the water in one of the community's seven wells. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Avera, spokesman for the county health agency, said the contamination was 
discovered Aug. 24, and customers of the Julian Community Services District 
were advised by mail last Friday and Saturday to use bottled water until 
further notice. 
</P>
<P>
Avera said that the benzene-contaminated water does not pose "an acute or 
immediate health hazard." However, he said, benzene is listed by the state as a 
carcinogen if exposure is long-term. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation is under way into the source of the well contamination, Avera 
said, adding that the probable cause is leakage from an underground gasoline 
storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contamination Has Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Since the well was shut last Thursday, the contamination in the water system 
has dropped, Avera said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing will continue, and the well will remain closed until the water is fit 
for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Several Julian businesses contacted Thursday were unaware of the new 
bottled-water advisory. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Hill, a clerk at the Julian Market, said there was no run on bottled 
water at the store. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tap Water Tastes OK to Me' 
</P>
<P>
A clerk at the Julian Hotel said he thought the hotel served bottled water 
routinely to dining room guests, but he added that "the tap water tastes OK to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Julian-area residents were urged to cut down on water usage 
or face mandatory water rationing after community wells, affected by a 
three-year drought, were strained to keep up with demand. The voluntary water 
conservation advisory is still in effect.

THE BALTIC AND EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spate of articles on the Baltic illustrates one more ghost of the Soviet 
Union's past that begs excoriation. For 50 years the existence of secret 
protocols were denied. Now they are finally acknowledged, but the necessary 
conclusions apparently are still too painful for the Soviet Union to admit. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania never 
joined the Soviet Union voluntarily. If Gorbachev is sincere about glasnost, he 
should admit the wrongs of his predecessors and let these people go. When the 
Balts by the millions are signing petitions demanding independence, when their 
respective legislatures are passing resolutions declaring their sovereignty, 
and when millions of people join hands in a human chain from Talinn to Vilnius 
to demonstrate their solidarity, I think this is a historic opportunity to come 
through as a truly great leader by admitting that the Balts were wrongfully 
absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Just as small countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark are peaceful and 
useful neighbors amid larger countries, the same can occur in the Baltic 
region. Instead of being restless and complaining members of the Soviet Union, 
the independence of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia would advance peace and 
mutual respect in the region.

UNCHALLENGED CANDIDATES 'WIN' SCHOOL DISTRICT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jim Duffy put in his bid for a seat on the South Bay Union High School 
District Board of Education, he expected to find himself embroiled in a 
campaign battle with other contenders in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
But only two other candidates filed for three vacancies, so this week the 
county registrar-recorder's office called off the battle for lack of a contest. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, the county canceled school elections in the Lawndale and 
Wiseburn elementary districts. They also had only three candidates each for 
three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
Those who filed -- challengers and incumbents seeking another term -- can serve 
for four years in their respective districts, just as if they had been elected, 
a notice from the county said. 
</P>
<P>
The short-version elections saved each of the districts from $6,000 to $10,000, 
which made school officials happy. And none of the unopposed candidates 
objected to being handed the prize without a fight. "I really expected some 
opposition," said Duffy, a Manhattan Beach resident and aerospace engineer. 
"But it's fine this way too." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has been active in civic organizations for many years, said he has 
long had an interest in school affairs and intended to run some day for the 
high school board. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and two incumbents up for reelection, Tom Downs and Lyn Flory, will be 
sworn in at the board's organizational meeting in December. 
</P>
<P>
In Lawndale, Trustee-elect Thomas Wayne Garrett said he ran for the local 
school board 16 years ago. "But I didn't make it," he said. Then, he said, he 
got very busy in his career, traveling to such places as Saudi Arabia and 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he settled into a sales job with a microfiche firm in the South Bay, 
he said, and decided that it was time to run again for the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a dream come true," he said Thursday. "I was planning to order 
banners, ribbons, potholders and all that campaign stuff tomorrow. But I guess 
I can wait for the next time." 
</P>
<P>
He will be officially seated at the board table in December with incumbents 
Bonnie Coronada and Robert Kruse, whose terms will be extended for another four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wiseburn Activist 
</P>
<P>
In the Wiseburn district, which serves the west part of Hawthorne and an 
adjacent county area, Trustee-elect Angelina Garza was long known for her 
active role as a parent in school affairs. Supt. John McCarthy praised her as 
one of the "old reliables who can always be counted on to pitch in whenever 
help is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Then, a while ago, Garza said, she was talking with a trustee about the 
upcoming elections, and the trustee said: "Hey, Angie, why don't you run for 
the school board?" 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't have picked a better time. Garza, an administrative secretary at 
an aerospace firm, will be sworn into office with incumbents Walter Guerrero 
and Daniel Juarez in December.

EPA MEMO CITES FLAWS IN ROCKWELL RADIATION TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal Environmental Protection Agency memo says Rockwell International for 
years has used faulty test methods to monitor radioactive pollution at its 
Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, casting doubt on the accuracy 
of company data showing that contamination there is relatively mild. 
</P>
<P>
The internal memo by an EPA radiation expert attacked Rockwell's methods for 
analyzing water, soil and vegetation samples at Santa Susana, adding that he 
questioned "the validity of some, if not all, of their environmental data." 
</P>
<P>
Because of flawed analytical techniques, it is impossible to "guarantee that 
past actions have not caused off-site impacts" or that future problems will be 
detected before they affect off-site areas, said the eight-page memo by Gregg 
Dempsey, a health physicist and branch chief of the EPA's office of radiation 
programs in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dempsey added, he found nothing that should worry the site's 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Richard Saxon, who heads the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for 
Social Responsibility, said Dempsey's findings confirm the group's belief that 
Rockwell and its customer, the U.S. Department of Energy, have failed to 
adequately monitor the site. Saxon's group is fighting renewal of the nuclear 
materials license Rockwell needs to recycle nuclear fuel at Santa Susana for 
use at DOE weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
"There obviously needs to be a more massive monitoring of Santa Susana, and 
Rockwell should not be given a new license to operate a nuclear fuel rod 
recycling facility," Saxon said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dempsey stressed in an interview that flaws in the monitoring program do 
not translate into an immediate health risk to people near the 2,668-acre 
research complex in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not getting real excited about it," Dempsey said. "I don't think there is 
a reason for a person who lives . . . nearby to be concerned" about possible 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he based his opinion on measurements made during a July 12-13 visit to 
the site, which is operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division. 
</P>
<P>
During the visit, dosimeters -- devices to measure radiation exposure -- worn 
by EPA inspectors registered negligible radiation, the memo said. Moreover, 
survey instruments used by the EPA team showed radiation at or near natural 
background levels at most areas of the site. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials also took some soil and water samples during the visit. Some of 
the analyses have been concluded and "I haven't seen anything that's a problem" 
so far, Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the memo is certain to increase pressure on Rocketdyne and the DOE to 
allow independent monitoring of the Santa Susana site and a wider role for 
regulatory agencies that have been partly excluded under provisions of the 
Atomic Energy Act. The state Department of Health Services recently asked the 
DOE for a $250,000 grant to support state monitoring at Santa Susana and other 
DOE sites, including Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey's memo was dated July 28 but was not released until this week to give 
Rockwell officials a chance to respond, an EPA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to EPA 
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday letter to the EPA, Jon T. Nagamatsu, a Rocketdyne vice 
president, said the firm has agreed to follow some of Dempsey's recommendations 
and wants to discuss others with EPA officials. 
</P>
<P>
But he said radioactivity measurements by the EPA team provide further 
"assurance that the site and the surrounding environment are safe for our 
employees and our neighboring communities." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Santa Susana site is devoted to rocket testing and research for 
NASA and the Air Force. But 290 acres have been reserved for nuclear projects 
for the U.S. Department of Energy, including operation of 16 small nuclear 
reactors from the 1950s to the early 1980s and recycling of nuclear fuel for 
use in energy and weapons manufacturing programs. Demand for fuel recycling 
fizzled out, at least temporarily, in 1986. Current activity mainly involves 
the cleanup of soil and buildings contaminated by 30 years of nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials have consistently maintained that there is no evidence that 
toxic or radioactive contamination has migrated off the site and that there has 
never been a significant release of airborne radioactivity, despite some 
accidents in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey's memo did not specifically challenge these assertions. But it found 
numerous flaws in test methods utilized by Rockwell, which generated nearly all 
the data used by others to evaluate the site. 
</P>
<P>
"I had mixed feelings about what I saw" at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 
Dempsey wrote. "The staff was most cooperative and were very willing to show us 
everything we needed to see. They believe they are doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, their monitoring procedures need "updating very badly" to ensure 
they keep track of environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the memo said: 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Susana's radiological laboratory apparently has never undergone a 
thorough audit or review by Rocketdyne or the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
A periodic review "is a common practice among good laboratories," Dempsey said. 
In his letter to the EPA, Nagamatsu said Rocketdyne is taking Dempsey's advice 
and hiring outside experts to review the laboratory techniques. 
</P>
<P>
* Methods used to test vegetation on the site for radioactivity are seriously 
flawed. The firm's written procedure calls for washing vegetation before 
testing, assuring that any airborne contamination that settled on the plant 
instead of being absorbed through the roots "is washed off before counting," 
Dempsey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it when I read this," Dempsey said in an interview, 
referring to the company's testing protocol. In addition, Rocketdyne ceased 
testing vegetation in 1986, Dempsey found. "I don't understand why they stopped 
collecting vegetation," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Nagamatsu said in his letter that the company will work with EPA to restore 
vegetation testing. 
</P>
<P>
* The procedure used to test soil "is a screening method at best." It does not 
provide "a true representation of conditions present in the environment." 
</P>
<P>
* Rocketdyne has failed to test soil and ground water for tritium, a form of 
radioactive hydrogen. Dempsey said while some radioactive materials bind 
tightly to soil and do not readily move into ground water, tritium is more 
mobile and so its presence is a better indicator of potential ground-water 
pollution. Dempsey said that a device called a liquid scintillation counter is 
required to test for tritium and that he was "rather surprised" to learn Santa 
Susana doesn't have one. 
</P>
<P>
* Rocketdyne does not have "a good 'handle' on where radiation has been 
inadvertently or intentionally dumped on-site," the memo said. "Most of the 
evidence on site spills is incompletely documented or anecdotal." The memo 
recommended that consultants be hired to do aerial searches for contaminated 
areas. Nagamatsu said aerial searches have been done in the past and will be 
done in the future. 
</P>
<P>
* Rocketdyne should install a meteorological tower at Santa Susana, instead of 
relying on data from Burbank Airport on wind patterns and other weather 
conditions. "It's good data for Burbank," Dempsey said in an interview. "It may 
not be good data for Rocketdyne." 
</P>
<P>
* Rocketdyne has no program for testing wildlife for possible contamination. 
The memo recommended that the company get permits to kill squirrels and deer 
near the site or analyze road kills. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's involvement at Santa Susana followed wide publicity in May about a 
DOE report on chemical and radioactive contamination at Santa Susana. The EPA's 
role at the site had been minimal, but Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
demanded that the agency assess the site and coordinate oversight by a group of 
health and environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA agreed to chair an interagency task force on Santa Susana. Its July 
visit to Santa Susana was part of a reassessment of the site under the federal 
Superfund program, which targets the nation's worst toxic waste sites for 
priority action. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana previously scored far too low on a hazard scale to make the 
Superfund list, which includes about 900 sites nationwide. The main reason was 
lack of evidence that residents of the comparatively sparsely populated areas 
around the laboratory were exposed to air, water or soil contamination. 
Although the reassessment is incomplete, EPA officials have said it appears the 
site still will not qualify for Superfund status.

PACKED CSUN HALTS SPRING ENROLLMENT; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS WEIGH PENALIZING SENIORS WHO DON'T GRADUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Cal State Northridge clamped the lid on spring enrollment 
Thursday. They also described a proposal to make getting into classes harder 
for seniors who stay at the university long after becoming eligible for 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Packed classrooms have forced CSUN officials to limit the number of students by 
moving up admission deadlines. "We're trying to bring down the number of 
students and to prevent classes from being overcrowded," university spokeswoman 
Ann Salisbury said in announcing that CSUN is accepting no more undergraduate 
students for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
There is no formal deadline, but officials generally have been closing spring 
enrollment in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
When fall classes begin Tuesday, CSUN will have 29,400 students, about 600 
fewer than the first day of the fall semester last year, said Lorraine Newlon, 
director of admissions and records. The school's capacity is about 30,000, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To allow more students a chance to attend CSUN, Newlon said, campus officials 
are talking about giving longtime seniors last choice of classes during 
registration. Making registration difficult for seniors who have at least 60 
units more than the 124 needed for graduation might encourage them to graduate, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now those students are given first choice. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are just playing around, it's not appropriate that they have high 
registration priority," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eligible Students Don't Graduate 
</P>
<P>
Newlon said several hundred students are eligible but choose not to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
The average CSUN graduate has taken 140 units, she said. "That suggests that 
some of our students are not making the fastest progress toward graduation." 
</P>
<P>
The plan would not penalize students who take more than four years to graduate 
because of full-time work or because they have changed their area of study, 
Newlon said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, students at Cal State campuses are taking longer to graduate than in 
the past, said Ralph Bigelow, director of analytic studies for the university 
system. In 1980 about 44% of the senior class graduated in its senior year, in 
1986 only 35%. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the explanation lies in students' working or choosing 
to take extra classes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, CSUN officials considered starting to penalize longtime seniors 
this fall. Instead, they postponed action to create a program to reward seniors 
who have filed for graduation. Those who have applied to graduate in the spring 
are being granted priority over other students registering for fall classes 
under a new computerized registration procedure.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN VANDAL SUSPECT ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-age suspect, booked on suspicion of vandalism, slipped out of his 
handcuffs, vaulted over a counter and escaped through the front door of the 
Lennox sheriff's station about 7 p.m. Wednesday, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles detained at the Lennox station are handcuffed to a chair in the lobby 
until they can be transferred to another facility. They cannot be housed with 
adults in the station's cells, Lt. Anthony Denis said, and there is no other 
place to keep them. While in the lobby, juveniles are watched by a jailer, an 
assistant jailer and, from behind a two-way mirror, the watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the escape, however, the assistant jailer was counting prisoners 
in another section of the station while the jailer completed paper work in an 
office out of sight of the juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
When the watch commander realized that the juvenile was escaping, he yelled, 
and deputies chased the youth but did not catch him. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile had been picked up three hours earlier after he was seen 
spray-painting the wall of a beauty salon in the 10500 block of South Normandie 
Avenue.

SKATER ROLLS THE EXTRA MILE (3,000 OF THEM) TO FIGHT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Southern California, few people pay much heed to a tall, tan, blond man 
roller-skating down the street in exercise tights and a T-shirt. The same 
figure zipping down a rural road in the Midwest, however, cannot help but 
attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
California indifference aside, that is why Maryland blacksmith Don Dressel 
decided that roller-skating across country this summer would be an ideal way to 
raise the awareness of young people about AIDS and how to avoid the deadly 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dressel, 34, left Maryland on June 3 and had traveled more than 3,000 miles 
before he puffed over Topanga Canyon on Wednesday. As he traveled the country, 
he stopped in small towns and big cities to talk about the myths and realities 
of AIDS, to encourage people to help AIDS sufferers in their communities, and 
to raise money for health organizations that assist AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrived Last Week 
</P>
<P>
Dressel arrived in Southern California last week. He skated west on Ventura 
Boulevard from the Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills on Tuesday. He left the next 
day for the Pacific Coast Highway and San Francisco -- his final destination. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said, the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome has 
been waged mainly by two specific groups: the gay community, and friends and 
relatives of the sick. Dressel said he does not fit into either category. He 
said he is just a concerned citizen who felt he had to spread a message. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this to show other people that they don't have to be in any group to be 
involved with AIDS," he said over a breakfast of a milkshake, toast, cereal, 
juice and fruit. "I am just a regular guy doing this, but you don't have to do 
what I am doing to have an impact. You can do something in your own community. 
People without cancer support cancer research. Why not AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
Dressel's trip through Southern California has been disappointing, he said, 
because people seem uninterested in his venture. But in the dozens of small 
towns, people always took notice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Questions 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he and his support van, with the slogan "Roll Over AIDS" emblazoned 
on the side, rolled into a town, he said he was almost immediately swamped by 
folks with questions. A hotel manager in one small community was so impressed 
that he called the city officials, who gathered at the local fire station to 
hear Dressel talk. 
</P>
<P>
His most emotional encounter, Dressel said, was with a 20-year-old in a small 
town in Indiana, who approached Dressel as he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was surprised that we were not escorted out of town," Dressel 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The young man then confided that moments earlier his doctor had told him that 
he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. He sobbed, saying he had lived in 
that town his entire life and feared that he would be driven out when people 
discovered he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"He cried for 40 minutes," Dressel recalled. "He said he did not know anybody 
who stayed more than a day after learning they had AIDS. We were talking about 
what he could do. I was the first person he told." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone Dressel has met, however, has been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missouri Incident 
</P>
<P>
He remembered stopping at a red light on a Missouri road next to a car with a 
family. The children in the back were squirming to try to see and wave at him. 
</P>
<P>
"The dad yelled out to his kids, 'Don't look at them!' I guess they think they 
all have AIDS now because they read it on the truck," Dressel said. 
</P>
<P>
Others took a dimmer view of his methods than his message. Dressel usually 
skated 35 to 50 miles a day, with his support van following closely behind. His 
average speed was about 10 m.p.h., and he allowed plenty of time to stop and 
talk. He usually stopped just before dark, and always tried to stay out of the 
way of cars. 
</P>
<P>
But in Salina, Kan., he said, a sheriff's deputy in a patrol car pulled up next 
to him, screamed that Dressel could not skate in the street, then sped away. 
The only problem, Dressel said, was that there were not many sidewalks to use 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
And in Colorado, legislation designed primarily to stop people from skiing on 
mountain roads in winter also outlawed skating on public roads. Dressel 
received de facto permission to skate from the Colorado state line to Denver, 
but from Denver he rode in the van until he reached New Mexico, where he 
resumed skating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generally Successful 
</P>
<P>
Dressel said the journey has generally been successful in terms of heightening 
awareness about AIDS. However he said he is frustrated with the lack of 
financial support from businesses and corporations, which he said he approached 
before the trip began. He has also asked for pledges and donations along the 
way for the foundation he established in Maryland -- The Roll Over AIDS 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Keith Rollings, former director of Baltimore's Office of AIDS Policy 
Coordination, said Dressel plans to give the money he raises to health 
organizations across the country that assist AIDS patients. Rollings also said 
the city had verified that Dressel's organization was legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Dressel said he has received $28,000 in donations and pledges and has spent 
$10,000 of his own money to pay for the trip. One expense, he said, are wheels 
for each of the three different types of skates he uses. He said he changes at 
least one set of wheels each day. 
</P>
<P>
Dressel said that if he had enough money, he would roller-skate back to 
Maryland rather than fly as planned. Early in his trip, he said, he talked to a 
group of 100 third-graders, who asked him how he would return from San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
When he told them he was taking a plane, "they all started booing. They said I 
should skate back because then I could talk to so many more people."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: 2ND ENTRY IN NEW DEL MAR DINING DERBY GALLOPS TO 
THE TABLE A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Mar is not only where the surf meets the turf, but also the town where surf 
'n' turf always has ridden high on the more popular menus. In summers past, the 
crowds at many eateries have seemed to care much more about horseflesh than 
haute cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
But the eating habits of Del Mar may have been permanently altered by the 
opening of Del Mar Plaza, a collection of chic shops and restaurants at Camino 
del Mar and 15th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Il Fornaio opened first and became instantly trendy for its rustic and 
unfamiliar Italian menu (although it has lost favor with some Del Mar locals, a 
number of whom have complained that residence does not guarantee reservations). 
Epazote's, an offshoot of the outrageously popular Cilantro's, is set to begin 
dishing up its announced menu of "Baja bar food" soon. 
</P>
<P>
The new Pacifica Del Mar lit its stoves in early August as the second entry in 
Del Mar Plaza's triple crown of eateries, and on the basis of just one dinner 
it seems like a sure winner. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third member of our local chain of Pacifica restaurants (the others 
are Old Town's Cafe Pacifica and the Pacifica Grill in downtown San Diego), 
and, like the other places run by proprietors Kip Downing and Deacon Brown, it 
seems an exception to the general rule that chain establishments offer 
nondescript fare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hip Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
The menu, of course, is what makes the place special. But the mood is unusual 
too, and the point could be made that Pacifica Del Mar is hip in a manner much 
more reminiscent of Southern California than of San Diego County. The interior 
seems to have been sculpted rather than built, or to have been thoughtfully 
carved out of a large block of generic building; there are graceful angles, 
gracefully lit and highlighted here and there with funky and amusing artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant prints the menu daily, and it is a fine, solid menu, as long as 
you want something at least slightly offbeat. A recent list opened on a note of 
coy whimsicality with a starter of "kim chee crab Martini," which, while 
serious fare, was fun to eat, and how often can that comment be applied to 
cuisine? 
</P>
<P>
The same menu closed with a dish of Balinese grilled beef tenderloin with 
lobster and macadamia nuts, which went unsampled but obviously was intended as 
Pacifica's tongue-in-cheek salute to the eternally popular surf 'n turf. 
</P>
<P>
Characterizing this menu is not easy -- it could be called California cuisine, 
but with the qualifier that it has progressed far beyond what the term used to 
mean. In general terms, the cuisine jumbles an international range of 
ingredients and cooking styles, with a heavy reliance on Oriental seasonings 
and some emphasis on Western American cooking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inventive Dishes 
</P>
<P>
The result is such hybridized dishes as takoshimi, or flash-charred, 
cracked-pepper-coated slices of ahi dressed with Chinese "salsa"; fettuccine 
with scallops, asparagus and black bean sauce, and steamed catfish with Beijing 
barbecue sauce. These dishes, while based on the principles of several 
cuisines, are native to none and are obvious inventions, but that is all to the 
good, since invention is the genius of cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list is perhaps the cleverest part of the menu, and while these 
don't come cheaply, they are hard to pass because it is obvious that the 
kitchen takes a real delight in planning them. Recent choices included 
nut-coated lamb riblets with spicy plum sauce, Chinese smoked chicken ravioli 
with mustard and scallions, and soft shell crab with onion tempura, Japanese 
horseradish paste and soy sauce, but if the kim chee crab Martini is available, 
give it a try. (Kim chee is an inclusive Korean term for various spicy pickled 
vegetables, especially cabbage, but here the cabbage and other veggies are raw; 
when combined with lovely chunks of Dungeness crab and soaked with a bit of 
gin, the effect is of a tipsy crab cole slaw. Unseen chilies provide the 
typical kim chee heat. The dish is served in an oversized Martini glass that 
has been cheerfully -- even goofily -- garnished with a crab claw tipped with a 
fat green olive.) 
</P>
<P>
The wok-charred calamari steak with wild mushrooms and cilantro (an herb as 
common in Chinese cooking as it is in Mexican) was well-cooked but dull, and 
the rice that filled out the plate made it seem too substantial for a starter. 
The smoked chicken and mango bisque was a much happier choice, the broth rather 
too thin to be a real bisque but the flavor delightful with the mingled notes 
of sweetness and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the salads, including the Thai chicken with vegetables and the sashimi 
with fresh fruit and pickled ginger vinaigrette, can be interpreted as entrees, 
but they also can be split for two to four diners as a salad course. The salad 
of minced Pacific Northwest smoked salmon jerky tossed with Romaine lettuce and 
Parmesan cheese is referred to as a Caesar, which is stretching the 
nomenclature rather far, but it is a tasty and inventive jumble and a real 
credit to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seafood Emphasis 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica restaurants have made their reputation on well-cooked, cleverly 
garnished seafood, and that emphasis continues in Del Mar. A grilled swordfish 
steak, glazed with a pungent soy sauce mixture and dressed with a Chinese 
"pesto" of ginger, cilantro, garlic and scallions, was beautifully finished and 
wonderfully flavored. The same remark applies to a thick slice of mako shark, 
which offered exceptionally tender flesh and was happy with its pointedly 
Southwestern relish of cilantro, sweet corn and cumin. 
</P>
<P>
The brief list of meats offered Petaluma-raised chicken with pistachios and 
fancy Mendocino mustard and a Black Angus rib-eye steak with forest mushrooms 
and smoked chilies. A third choice was a California version of a Greek and 
Italian dish, braised lamb shanks, with Napa Valley Cabernet substituted for 
the table red usually employed in the recipe. Although the menu specified 
rosemary in the seasoning, the sauce was quite bland, and, although the meat 
had been carefully braised, the dish ranked as the least satisfactory of those 
sampled. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica restaurants' justly famous burnt cream headlines the desserts, but 
there are other treasures, as well as an oddment or two. The best may be the 
"Kona chocolate lava torte," a mousse-like cake (or cake-like mousse) richly 
flavored with chocolate and coffee, and exotically sauced with passion fruit 
puree, which is excellent. The layered chocolate and orange "Napoleon" features 
layers of mousse rather than pastry, but is nice, and would be the dessert of 
choice for anyone who wants something light. The strawberry "red hots" are a 
touch too far-out, though; the berries are coated with cinnamon-flavored 
chocolate and piled on a sorbet that tastes very much like the cinnamon "red 
hot" candies, and, although it is a novelty, one bite seems sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant also offers an extensive and regularly updated wine list, with 
many bottles available by the glass and sometimes even by the taste. There are, 
however, far too few choices in the inexpensive range.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE NAMES HERB CAWTHORNE VICE PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Herb Cawthorne, who resigned in a veil of secrecy as president of the San Diego 
Urban League, was named vice president of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne's appointment was announced late in the afternoon and came as a 
surprise. Cawthorne said last month that he was founding a development company 
to revitalize the downtown and Southeast areas of San Diego. It was not clear 
Thursday whether he would continue with the previously announced Cawthorne Co. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials said Cawthorne, who resigned from the Urban League in June, 
will begin his new duties today and will be in charge of local government 
issues, including growth management and downtown redevelopment. He will replace 
Dorothy Migdal, who died earlier this year after serving 12 years as chamber 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-page written statement released by the chamber, President Lee Grissom 
is quoted as saying that he was impressed by Cawthorne's "leadership, vision 
and passionate commitment to San Diego." Grissom said he also expects Cawthorne 
to play a major role in "public safety issues" affecting the city. 
</P>
<P>
The statement included a brief mention of Cawthorne's recent two-year tenure at 
the Urban League and ignored the controversy that surrounded his resignation 
June 7. Cawthorne and other league officials have never explained his sudden 
departure from a post that made him possibly the city's most influential black 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne and his attorney have also refused to comment on allegations of 
fiscal mismanagement at the league that was reportedly revealed by an internal 
audit of his spending. 
</P>
<P>
He also served as executive director of the Portland, Ore., Urban League before 
coming to San Diego. A Portland newspaper reported in May that league officials 
there were blaming Cawthorne for huge debts that had been piled up by the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
According to chamber officials, Cawthorne graduated from the University of 
Oregon and taught for 12 years at Portland State and the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cawthorne nor Grissom could be reached for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's citywide campaign on growth controls, Cawthorne 
energetically spoke out against the most restrictive slow-growth proposals, 
which he said would be economically detrimental to the black community.

Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) was "resting comfortably" 
Thursday after doctors removed two benign tumors, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery took place Wednesday at an undisclosed Los Angeles-area hospital, 
said aide Rob Wilcox, who gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) told colleagues on the Assembly 
floor Wednesday of La Follette's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette came through the operation "with flying colors" and is expected to 
recover in the next four to six weeks, Wilcox said. She will remain 
hospitalized for several more days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette is relieved that the tumors were benign and generally is "feeling 
really well," Wilcox said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SIMI FIRES CAUSE $210,000 IN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two unrelated fires in Simi Valley caused $210,000 in damage to two houses 
Thursday -- one of them set afire by a fireworks rocket that landed on the 
roof, the Ventura County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in either fire. 
</P>
<P>
The first blaze started about 12:25 p.m. in a one-story house in the 2100 block 
of St. Clair Avenue, Fire Department dispatcher Annie Ironside said. It was 
ignited by a rocket that had been launched by several youths nearby and landed 
on the house's roof, she said. The blaze, which caused $105,000 in damage, was 
extinguished at 1 p.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old youth was arrested on suspicion of arson and released to his 
parents, the Simi Valley Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The second fire broke out about 1:50 p.m. in the garage of a two-story house in 
the 3500 block of Wellston Court, Ironside said. The blaze, which was confined 
to the garage and extinguished at 2:45 p.m., also caused $105,000 in damage, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters pushed a $20,000 Mercedes-Benz out of the garage before the car 
was damaged, she said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE ARREST OWNERS OF PACOIMA SALVAGE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men arrested at a Pacoima auto parts yard on suspicion of possession of 
stolen property were identified as the owners of the business, Los Angeles 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Gorin, 31, and Lonya Palatnik, 35, both of West Hollywood, were 
arrested Wednesday afternoon at All-In-One Auto Dismantlers in the 12200 block 
of Montague Street, police said. Detective Mike Miller said investigators 
suspect that stolen cars were sold to the owners who then "chopped" them into 
parts to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after detectives on a routine inspection found what they 
called a "chop shop" where stolen cars are stripped and the pieces sold as 
parts. Gorin and Palatnik were booked at the Foothill Division Jail but were 
later released on $5,000 bail each, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said a task force of auto theft investigators Wednesday began what will 
be a routine program of spot-checking salvage yards for stolen cars and parts. 
All-In-One was the third yard checked that day and detectives found parts from 
seven stolen cars at the yard, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the stolen parts were parts of a 1985 Honda Prelude that had been stolen 
four days earlier from Montebello, Miller said. Only the seats, engine, 
transmission, bumper and steering wheel were found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the parts were determined stolen by serial numbers but one bumper 
at the yard still had a license plate attached that belonged to a car that had 
been reported stolen.

A GUIDE TO CHINESE HERBAL ELIXIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tonic of deer antlers is a powerful rejuvenator while a tea of lobster eyes, 
Ganoderma mushroom, licorice root will relieve physical pain. And the man who 
tells you so is Ron Teeguarden, who explains that he learned his craft from a 
Chinese Taoist master and seems so intent on demystifying herbal healing that 
he even wrote a book about it, "Chinese Tonic Herbs" (Japan Publications Inc.). 
</P>
<P>
Other liquid refreshments on Teeguarden's exotic list consist of lycium 
berries, a tension reliever, or longan mixed with walnuts, to generate energy. 
Customers who want to clear their complexion ask for Schizandra tea, made from 
round, red berries the ancient Chinese royalty relied on to moisten and firm 
their skin. It works, in part, by stimulating sexual fluids, Teeguarden notes. 
</P>
<P>
He serves Chinese Orchid, Ho Shou Wu and Poria to aid longevity. Tienchi, known 
as the miracle root for the preservation of life, as a blood cleanser. Cinnamon 
to relive muscle strain and dried orange peel to aid digestion. 
</P>
<P>
Of the several thousand herbs in the Chinese system, only about 30 are 
considered Imperial, or superior, tonic herbs, he explains. These must be 
totally natural, promote longevity, elevate the spirit, enhance wisdom, 
inducing relaxation and, not coincidentally, taste good. BARBARA FOLEY

A RESPITE FOR THE WEARY IN GARDEN OF HERBAL DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KYLE RODERICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 5:30 on a Friday afternoon, and the Elixir Bar at the Tea Garden Herbal 
Emporium is buzzing with health-conscious locals, stressed-out entertainment 
executives and professional athletes, swapping health histories, herbal 
formulas and occasionally phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Production designer Beth Rubino plops down on a bar stool and tells the 
bartender. "I'm fried from two hours on the freeway. Please give me something 
to calm me down." 
</P>
<P>
Nathalie Alexander, an actress who bicycled over for a post-workout pick-me-up, 
orders a Ginseng Roughy Fizz. It gives her such a quick lift that she gushes: 
"Now I'm ready to go out dancing." 
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m., people are still hanging out. Finally, store owner Ron Teeguarden 
politely asks them if he could please close down. He wants to go home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Alcoholic Watering Hole 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to hip hangouts these days, those seeking a non-alcoholic, 
low-cal watering hole are heading to the Elixir Bar in Venice. Restaurants are 
too pricey, cafes too intoxicating; and juice bars are downright passe. At the 
varnished aspen bar, surrounded by antique wooden herb chests, people munch 
Taoist Journey Trail Mix and sip Chinese herbal cocktails made by mixing 
ginseng, licorice root and other exotic herbs with cold sparkling water. 
</P>
<P>
"It tastes like sweet tea or soda pop," says habitue Terry Reyburn. But they 
are so soothing, she says, "an hour at the Elixir Bar is like a day at the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
Teeguarden, a Chinese herbalist who studied with a Taoist master, came up with 
the idea for the Elixir Bar while visiting Tokyo 10 years ago. "There were 
street corner stands all over the city where you can buy Chinese herbal 
extracts in glass vials," Teeguarden explains. "People sip them while walking 
down the street or riding on subways as a health supplement." 
</P>
<P>
Although Western medicine downplays the impact of Chinese herbs, they have been 
used in China to enhance health and promote longevity for at least 3,000 years. 
"While these herbal formulas don't cure disease," says Teeguarden, who cautions 
he isn't a doctor and he doesn't prescribe medicine, "they do help promote what 
the Taoists call 'radiant health.' " 
</P>
<P>
At costs ranging from $4 to $6, ginseng energy tonics are the most popular, 
especially when people come straight from the freeway. But relaxation elixirs 
and energy tonics are frequently requested by such devoted customers as Laker 
player Jeff Lamp, playwright John Steppling, record producer Richard Perry and 
Academy Award-winning film producer Bob Chartoff ("Rocky"). 
</P>
<P>
Teeguarden created a super tonic program for the Rolling Stones. And Lisa Bonet 
stopped by regularly during her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from Polish princes to personal trainers comes here," said film 
production coordinator Birgitte Thygesen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interesting People' 
</P>
<P>
"I invariably meet interesting people when I come to the Tea Garden," says 
Santa Monica lawyer Joel Edelman. "Chinese herbs seem to attract creative, 
adventurous people who are interested in health without being fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years," says the lawyer, who comes by almost every day for take-home 
elixirs, "I've found that taking these oral liquids is more effective in 
preventing colds and other illnesses than the acupuncture and chiropractic 
treatments I used to get. I'm 50 years old, and I feel like I'm still in my 
30s." 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionist and personal trainer Philip Mendez, who pops in four times a week, 
also sends his clients in for energy-building drinks. "These elixirs have 
helped me build more endurance, heal injuries and combat fatigue," says the 
Malibu trainer, who uses them as a health supplement, just like vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Since they opened in February 1988, Cynthia Teeguarden noticed that a high 
percentage of customers are either in Alcoholics Anonymous or trying to cut out 
cigarettes, coffee or marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to smoke while I worked," says Thygesen, "but after taking Chinese 
herbs and elixirs for a few months, I don't crave the stimulation of 
cigarettes." She doesn't feel like drinking alcohol any more either. "Besides 
this is the nicest bar you could ever go to." 
</P>
<P>
But the Elixir Bar also serves restorative drinks to those in the throes of a 
hangover or reeling from too much rich food. "We make a special cocktail for 
hangovers with angelica, trichosanthis (which is used in the new AIDS drug, 
Compound Q), chrysanthemum, magnolia and a splash of deer antler to get the 
mind going again," says Teeguarden. 
</P>
<P>
As exotic car dealer Peter Morris says, "In a few years, these elixirs may be 
popular across the country because they give you a definite buzz while actually 
being good for you."

TABOOS YIELD TO 'ANYTHING GOES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, before things like topless swimsuits and miniskirts broke most of 
the rules, there were serious fashion taboos. Lots of them, including no white 
shoes after Labor Day, no patent leather in the winter, no suede in the summer, 
velvet and taffeta from Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve only and head-to-toe 
black tie if that's what the invitation said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, any fashion rules that remain tend to be more a matter of opinion than 
fact. Without a consensus coming from designers, retailers and sticklers for 
social tradition, the question has changed from, "Is this correct?" to "Can I 
carry this off?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End of an Era 
</P>
<P>
New York designer Bill Blass, who still clings to "velvet after February is a 
taboo just because it looks too warm," says fashion dictate ended in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when the youths of the street took over and everything exploded: music, 
art, fashion. There was a whole new concept: Express yourself; wear whatever 
you want. Of course, there are pockets here and there where things are taboo, 
but for the most part, anything goes." 
</P>
<P>
"Without the rules, you have to rely on your eye to tell you if something is 
right or not," observes Patricia Fox, director of fashion and marketing for 
Saks Fifth Avenue, who notes the rule about a matching handbag and shoes "was 
among the first to go," closely followed by the one about matching jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
So, there's really no need to put away your white shoes after Labor Day. Not if 
you agree with the fashion tastes of Salvatore Ferragamo and Yves Saint 
Laurent, among others. Ferragamo's white, red and blue spectators are in the 
fall lineup at Saks Fifth Avenue. And Saint Laurent's fall accessories include 
a black-heeled white pump worn with sheer black hose and tweed pants. 
</P>
<P>
But tradition dies hard for some. Nancy Livingston, one-time film ingenue, 
currently a member of the board of governors of the Music Center, won't be 
buying those pumps. "I am incapable of wearing white shoes after Sept. 1," she 
explains. "I would rather go barefoot." 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Milwaukee, she grew up hearing the fashion facts of life 
from her mother. And a number of them are still on her list. "For me, it's 
very, very difficult to wear a velvet dress after New Year's Eve. Velvet is 
from Oct. 1, through Dec. 31." 
</P>
<P>
Although she still plays by a few old rules, Livingston wears pants (once 
reserved for rehearsals or the market) to luncheons and meetings. And gloves, 
which used to be part of her daily dress code, are now for gardening only. 
</P>
<P>
"When I lived in New York in the late '50s and early '60s, I would never, ever 
leave my apartment without gloves," she recalls. "I still have two drawers with 
the most beautiful kid gloves, each between a layer of tissue. They're symbols 
of my past, of my youth." 
</P>
<P>
Guarding tradition in New York, Charlotte Ford, member of the Henry Ford family 
and author of her own "Book of Modern Manners," has noticed that gloves "are on 
the way back. But you must take them off at the dinner table. I've been at big 
charity functions and seen women eating with them on. I've been repulsed by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
As for proper wedding attire, Ford says if the bride is going to wear white, 
"You don't want to compete. And to my personal thinking, black is out. But I 
think you can wear a combination of black and white." 
</P>
<P>
For years, socialites and designers were of a single mind on such issues. But 
not any more. New York designer Arnold Scaasi, who begs to differ with client 
Charlotte Ford on wedding etiquette, has no objection to either white or black, 
"except from an aesthetic view. I think it's prettier to wear color to a 
wedding." 
</P>
<P>
And while his bridal collection includes "fantasy gowns," there are also 
strapless gowns, unheard of in Emily Post's day, which he has designed in 
response to requests from "young brides with pretty shoulders and chests." 
</P>
<P>
With the rules bent all out of shape, it's formal occasions that leave most 
people to wonder if they will arrive in sync or out of kilter. Ford says she 
has no problem with a short evening dress for a black-tie event. White tie, 
however, means "tails for a man. And for a woman, it means a long dress, the 
dressiest you can get." 
</P>
<P>
A long gown is de rigueur for a White House state dinner, adds Scaasi, who 
designed Barbara Bush's Inaugural ball gown. And it's also long for the key 
players at the Academy Awards, the Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards, the Tony 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Non-participants can wear something short and very dressy, because they will be 
doing all that sitting. But Scaasi, who has wardrobed Jacqueline Bisset and 
Mary Tyler Moore for various awards ceremonies, says: "It's disappointing to 
see a great star come in a black wool jersey dress. To underplay it so much is 
just boring." 
</P>
<P>
Menswear, historically more tied to tradition, seems slower to change. At 
Carroll &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills, where John Carroll describes the customer 
as "more of an established gentleman," the clientele knows to not wear a 
button-down shirt with a double-breasted suit or combine slip-on shoes with a 
suit (only wing-tip or blucher oxfords allowed). 
</P>
<P>
They also know that cotton ties are not worn with wool jackets, nor are wool 
ties worn with silk jackets. As for rules regarding formal wear (tuxedos are a 
house specialty), the pleats in a cummerbund do indeed face upwards, although 
not necessarily to catch crumbs. "It's an old saying that's cute and funny, but 
who knows?" says Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
But even he concedes, "In terms of taboos, things are much more lax today. Men 
wear stripe ties with plaid suits and we wear bright colors. Ten years ago, if 
men wore anything but solid white or blue shirts, they were looked upon as 
strange." Now, Carroll's establishment is offering pastel pink, blue and ecru 
shirts for formal wear. 
</P>
<P>
Formality was a way of life for writer Susan Price, growing up in Chicago in 
the '50s and the '60s. There were hats in kindergarten; pearls, Bass Weejun 
loafers and cashmere sweaters in high school; mink coats after marriage and 
babies; no dangling earrings for women in the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
"And gentlemen never wore brown suits or shoes in the city, and monograms were 
taboo," recalls Price, who spent five years covering the celebrity scene for 
the Chicago Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
Living in Los Angeles now, she finds no fashion taboos, and she misses them. 
Take jewelry, for example. "The old saying was, 'Don't wear it unless it's 
real.' Here, it's 'Don't wear it if it is real because that might be dangerous 
and because people seem to dress for the paparazzi.' So it's big, flashy 
costume jewelry and flashy clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I long for the days when etiquette was etiquette, when you knew what 
invitations meant. Now you get a black-tie invitation and the question is: 'Am 
I a principal player who needs to go in my Bob Mackie gown, or am I an extra 
who should wear a little black dress, or do I show disdain for the event by 
wearing my Levi's?' " 
</P>
<P>
The answer, for better or worse: "Anything goes."

AMAZING DISGRACE;

<P>
JIM BAKKER'S NOW BATTLING NOT ONLY WITH THE LAW BUT TO KEEP A GRIP ON REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Jim Bakker is having a problem and is called before the government, that 
is Christianity being called before the government. That is the Body of 
Christ's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Bakker in his 1980 book, "Survival: Unite to Live" 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago in the same book where he equated himself with an entire 
religion, PTL founder Jim Bakker wrote of a premonition. He believed that 
"God's clock is in the final hour," meaning that the world would end soon. 
</P>
<P>
He may have been right -- but not in the way he intended. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday Bakker was on the precipice of a personal Armageddon that forced a 
halt to his media-saturated trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy. 
Bakker, whose PTL television ministry once had the potential to reach a billion 
people, was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing to see if he is mentally 
competent to stand trial, after he apparently became hallucinatory and 
irrational. The order by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspending the trial 
in its fourth day came after Bakker's psychiatrist testified that the 
televangelist, 49, suffered hallucinations and "was lying in the corner of his 
attorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding." 
</P>
<P>
"He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt him," Dr. Basil 
Jackson testified in a brief competency hearing in Judge Potter's court 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Federal marshals led a crying Bakker from his attorney's office shortly after 
the order was issued. "Please don't do this to me," Bakker pleaded before 
crawling into the waiting car and assuming a fetal position. He was taken to 
the federal courthouse here for paper-work processing and was led, crying and 
disheveled, out of the building some 90 minutes later in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a Milwaukee psychoanalyst, said Bakker's hallucinations began 
Wednesday after a prosecution witness collapsed while being cross-examined. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse, suddenly people outside 
took on the form of frightening animals which he felt were intent on destroying 
him, attacking him and hurting him," Jackson said. After the witness had 
collapsed, Bakker, prompted by his attorney, went to the witness' side, knelt 
down and began to pray. 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist also said that Bakker was suffering from "acute depression" 
and had "lost the ability to judge and evaluate reality." Bakker apparently was 
continuing to hallucinate Thursday morning when he was persuaded not to appear 
in court because "he was not able to participate in a rational manner in these 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who testified that he has been treating Bakker for about nine months, 
was present in court last week, ostensibly to advise Bakker's attorneys during 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
Federal marshals indicated that psychiatric tests would not be completed before 
Tuesday or Wednesday. Potter recommended that the tests be conducted at a 
psychiatric hospital that is part of a federal prison in Butner, N.C., about 
140 miles northeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
When he headed the PTL network, Bakker exercised power over millions with his 
emotional, often tearful, appeals. His sense of drama and staging brought PTL 
from backwoods obscurity to national and, ultimately, international prominence 
before the electronic ministry collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was forced to resign from PTL in 1987, Bakker reigned over Heritage 
USA, a gigantic theme park, resort and ministry headquarters that included 
hotels, a shopping center and PTL's state-of-the-art TV studios and satellite 
broadcast links. It was Bakker's need for luxury and television time, the 
government charges, that led him to divert donations earmarked for construction 
at Heritage to PTL's operating expenses and to his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's current, bargain-basement teleministry, based in Orlando, Fla., is 
carried by only eight television stations, in contrast to the hundreds that 
once beamed PTL programming into millions of homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakkers' overall circumstances are a comedown of interstellar proportions, 
too. And that fall from the heights seems to have put a strain on both. Lately, 
Tammy Faye Bakker -- who has not been present at the trial and who taped a 
program for broadcast Thursday -- has been issuing emotional pleas for 
contributions to her husband's legal defense fund, claiming that they owe 
lawyers about $1 million. At its height, PTL -- which means Praise the Lord and 
People that Love -- brought in $100 million a year in donations, defense 
attorney George T. Davis said in his opening argument. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's apparent mental collapse underscores concerns expressed before the 
trial began here Monday that Bakker was in a fragile state of mind. Moreover, 
court records, the testimony that had been presented against the television 
evangelist and his own behavior, indicate that the former high-flying head of 
PTL is a man who lived grandiose dreams but denied his own nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, denial or avoidance of hard realities was a Bakker hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, for instance, Bakker's former personal assistant David 
Taggart testified that when Bakker got bad news of any sort he "would turn 
around and look out" his office window, refusing to respond to the bearer of 
bad tidings. On the telephone, Bakker's silences could stretch up to 10 minutes 
when unwelcome information was passed along, Taggart noted. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Taggart said, underlings often were afraid to tell Bakker anything 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
It may be an indication of Bakker's denial that until just before the trial 
began, his largest concern was raising money to keep his latest television show 
on the air, a source close to Bakker said last week. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal grand jury began the investigation that led to his indictment, 
Bakker called it "a fishing expedition." 
</P>
<P>
And after he resigned from PTL, broke and in disgrace, Bakker turned up in the 
Palm Springs area with plans -- apparently without any reasonable hope of 
fruition -- for a hotel, golf courses and a religious theme park that would 
rival PTL's Heritage USA complex. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in a fund-raising letter last year, Tammy Bakker reported that her 
husband had lain in a fetal position for hours following his resignation from 
PTL. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker also practiced denial of another sort, according to Taggart, the 
prosecution's first witness. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart testified that Bakker sometimes chose to stay ignorant of what was done 
on his behalf. When he was approached about paying hush-money to cover up his 
1980 sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, Bakker refused 
to discuss the issue at any length, Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bakker made the statement he didn't believe in paying blackmail money but 
he told (former PTL executive vice president Richard) Dortch to do whatever you 
have to do," explained Taggart, who was convicted last month of tax evasion for 
using cash advances from PTL ministry credit cards to support his own expensive 
tastes in jewelry and cars. 
</P>
<P>
And although Bakker shied away from his own imbroglios, he was quick to fault 
others and demand that his whims be fulfilled, according to the prosecution. 
Bakker once ordered a cook fired at his ministry's Heritage USA headquarters 
because he was served a hamburger without mustard, prosecutor Jerry Miller said 
in his opening statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart testified that Bakker once ordered the air-conditioning to be 
reinstalled in his son's treehouse at their lakeside home near Heritage USA and 
demanded an explanation of why it had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed No Anguish 
</P>
<P>
Until his breakdown Wednesday and Thursday, Bakker seemed to be keeping himself 
in an iron grip. He showed no anguish or regret that he faces up to 120 years 
in prison and $5 million in fines if convicted of defrauding his followers of 
millions of dollars. He had been showing up for trial with a smile ready for 
the cameras and had been attentive during court, making notes and occasionally 
whispering to his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's collapse was the third health problem to strike former PTL executives 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The witness who collapsed Wednesday, former PTL vice president Steve Nelson, 
returned to court Thursday, saying "I feel a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dortch was admitted to a hospital in Clearwater, Fla., near his home, 
for an undisclosed ailment. Dortch, who was scheduled to testify for the 
prosecution, pleaded guilty Aug. 8 to three counts of fraud and one count of 
conspiracy for his role in the PTL scandal, the irresistible combination of 
religion, sex and money that produced such cultural artifacts as a violated 
church secretary turned centerfold, an air-conditioned doghouse and countless 
jokes about Tammy Faye Bakker's zealously applied makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's eye-popping events were additional icing on what was proving to be 
one of the biggest -- and wackiest -- stories of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Every television network, most major newspapers and news magazines, a 
smattering of the foreign press and a host of local media had staked out the 
courthouse grounds by the time the trial began in earnest Monday. 
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't include demonstrators such as the two men in baseball caps 
carrying signs condemning Bakker to perdition. Or the couple who arrived in a 
limousine wearing masks of Bakker and Tammy Faye. Or the man and woman hawking 
"Bible belts," black cloth belts with small Bibles glued to the buckle. 
</P>
<P>
The circus atmosphere was accented by the weather -- unrelenting, 
oxygen-depleting humidity punctuated by brief bursts of broiling sun and 
intense thunderstorms. By midweek, many of the television technicians, required 
to stay outside at all times, were both damp and tan. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, of course, had come to see -- or be part of -- another episode in 
the long-running spectacle of the PTL scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Maximum Bob' 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, only a few were chosen to enter the cramped 70-seat courtroom 
where Judge "Maximum Bob" Potter was presiding over Bakker's trial on 15 counts 
of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit 
mail and wire fraud. The charges stem from Bakker's fund-raising measures while 
he headed PTL. 
</P>
<P>
What the chosen few had been hearing this week was chapter and verse on how 
Bakker and his associates raised $158 million from 1984 to 1987 and how Bakker 
allegedly diverted more than $3.7 million for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Those benefits included such items as a $5,000 Christmas tree, a Florida 
vacation in a mansion that rented for $10,000 a week and two Cadillacs that 
cost a total of $57,000 -- one each for his home near here and for the Bakkers' 
house in Palm Springs, one of several homes or condominiums that Bakker once 
owned. The Bakker family once spent $600,000 on a Florida condominium that 
Tammy Bakker complained was "nothing but a hotel suite." 
</P>
<P>
"This case is about cheating people out of their money. This case is about 
tricking people out of their money," declared Miller in his opening argument. 
Miller, a former college football player and Washington, D.C., policeman, is 
one of two attorneys prosecuting Bakker. The other is Deborah Smith, a former 
newspaper reporter who once worked for the Justice Department in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
But Bakker's attorney, 82-year-old Davis, portrayed his client as the focus of 
a "lynch mob mentality." He also maintained that Bakker never had "criminal 
intent" in selling the partnerships. PTL was "the product of a religious, 
creative genius," Davis said, placing the blame on Dortch and Taggart, Bakker's 
two closest associates at PTL. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart of Government's Case 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the government's case is that Bakker raised the money for his many 
homes, cars and other extravagances largely by selling "lifetime partnerships" 
in Heritage USA, the theme park and ministry headquarters located in nearby Ft. 
Mill, S.C. Most of the $1,000 partnerships promised that donors would receive 
three nights of free lodging annually for the rest of their lives in a Heritage 
hotel or bunkhouse. Further, the government contends that Bakker knowingly sold 
more partnerships than could ever be accommodated, a total of 153,000. 
</P>
<P>
The diverted millions were used to support PTL executives' "lavish and 
extravagant life styles," the indictment maintains, alleging that Bakker, his 
wife and associates received millions in bonuses while keeping the amount of 
those bonuses -- often $100,000 or more -- secret. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the charges, a hard core of Bakker support remains, although, before 
his breakdown, most observers thought Bakker was almost a sure bet to be 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be glad when it's over and Jim is cleared," said Loretta Mays of 
Jacksonville, Fla., as she waited in line this week for a courtroom seat with a 
handful of other Bakker supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a problem with a reservation," declared Virginia Mack, also of 
Jacksonville, referring to her ability to use her $1,000 "lifetime 
partnership." "I would do it again," Mack said, noting that she had purchased 
three of the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bakker has been deserted by some of his closest associates, who also 
profited handsomely for spreading PTL's brand of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dortch and brothers David and PTL interior designer James Taggart are 
probably prison-bound for their parts in the scandal. All have agreed to 
testify against Bakker in hopes of leniency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damaging Development 
</P>
<P>
By far the most damaging development was the guilty plea last week of Dortch, 
PTL's defrocked former executive vice president and mastermind of the hush 
money payment to Hahn. Dortch was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and 
fined $200,000 -- two years and $300,000 less than he might have been fined 
under the plea agreement. However, if he performs to the prosecution's 
satisfaction, that term may be reduced. The Taggarts are to be sentenced Sept. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no way to know absolutely what transpired in the minds of Bakker 
and his associates, the physical evidence of their ambitions and their downfall 
lies open for all to see 14 miles south of here in Ft. Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian theme park, resort, campground and residential development -- 
Heritage USA -- that was the launch pad for Bakker's voyage to the drab, gray 
federal court building here is still open, in a manner of speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker originally envisioned Heritage partly as a Christian Disneyland or Magic 
Mountain, an alternative to the "secular theme parks" that were drawing both 
the faithful and the undevout. 
</P>
<P>
But as his television ministry grew and the money flowed in, his dreams 
mushroomed. In his final months and days as a big-time televangelist Bakker 
apparently conceived of Heritage USA's four square miles as a mini-theocracy, 
self-contained and sustained by his electronic pipeline to the pocketbooks of 
his followers. 
</P>
<P>
Plans called for a giant crystal palace containing the "largest church 
sanctuary in the world," a 5,000-seat television studio, 100 offices, hundreds 
of classrooms, altogether capable of accommodating 30,000 people at one time. 
Nearby a proposed "Crystal Tower" would house one-, two-, and three-bedroom 
timeshare condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Million Visitors 
</P>
<P>
Heritage USA attracted more than 10 million visitors from its opening in 1978 
until PTL declared bankruptcy in 1987, according to the ministry's own figures. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the flow of visitors that sustained these grandiose schemes has 
dried to a faucet drip. Weeds grow in the cracks between the concrete slabs of 
the vast, nearly empty parking lot. Weeds also sprout around an uncompleted 
fairy tale castle with five brass-colored towers; a sixth tower lies tumbled at 
the edge of the parking lot in tall grass and mounds of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The castle was meant to be part of Heritage's amusement park that included a 
giant water slide, a miniature railroad and an Old West town. Only the 
waterslide is open, attracting on one recent sweltering day a few hundred 
children and teen-agers who carried large blue inner tubes to the top of the 
slide like penitents climbing to a shrine. 
</P>
<P>
The other still-operating portions of Bakker's former kingdom on earth include 
a chapel called the Upper Room, the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel and Main 
Street Heritage USA, a mall-like array of shops selling fudge, baked goods, 
toys, Christian art and a combination souvenir, book and music store. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest, the souvenir shop contains a potpourri of items left over 
from the Bakkers' zenith. The records, tapes, books, Bibles, coffee mugs, 
insulated cups, T-shirts, jackets, post cards, sweat shirts, buttons, baseball 
caps, ceramic bells, boomerangs, Frisbees, stuffed animals and other items are 
marked 50% to 75% off their original prices -- if not much more. Maps of 
Heritage USA, formerly $2, are 99 cents each -- and the customer gets two maps 
free. A coffeetable book titled "Jim &amp; Tammy Bakker Present the Ministries 
of Heritage Village Church," once priced at $100, is now $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
One end of Main Street opens onto the lobby of the Heritage Grand Hotel, which 
sports an in-door swimming pool. The smell of chlorine from the pool -- which 
doubles as a baptismal pond -- mixes with the strains of Christian music 
issuing from large speakers on a dais that also holds a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Glaring Symbol 
</P>
<P>
Outside the hotel lobby, the most glaring symbol of Bakker's downfall stands 
vacant and boarded up, surrounded by a deteriorating barricade of wooden 
sawhorses. The 21-story skeleton is the Heritage Grand Towers Hotel. A 
construction crane still stands in place on the building's flank, and an 
overgrown field behind the rusting crane is littered with big bundles of bricks 
and other building materials. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of most, the verdict of the federal jury -- if there is one -- will 
determine whether the abandoned hotel, the crumbling castle and the moribund 
Main Street are the remnants of a grand dream or a seedy scam.

MATRONLY RENDITION OF GERSHWIN REMOVES POP FROM SUMMERPOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Guest conductor Murry Sidlin brought audience participation into his SummerPops 
format Wednesday night at Hospitality Point. In what appeared to be a 
democratic exercise, the audience voted with its applause for each piece on the 
program (Sidlin and the San Diego Symphony had prepared three selections for 
each category). But, like so many American elections, the outcome of the voting 
was of little consequence, since the musical candidates for which the audience 
cast ballots were all cut from the same bolt of cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Wednesday's audience was dying to hear Rossini's Overture to "William 
Tell," even though a significant portion of their fellow listeners was just as 
enthusiastic about hearing the can-can from Offenbach's Overture to "Orpheus in 
the Underworld." And the finale of Dvorak's Symphony "From the New World" beat 
out the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth by 10 points on the applause meter. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra was playing well -- with more than a modicum of enthusiasm -- 
until the concert's momentum stalled in a lackadaisical reading of Gershwin's 
"Rhapsody in Blue." Guest pianist Constance Geanakoplos approached this earthy, 
jazzy war horse with the dainty formality of a matron serving tea, and her 
light, fussy technique was not up to Gershwin's keyboard requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Following this pallid Gershwin imitation and the usual, longish pops 
intermission, the audience's enthusiasm for the whole project diminished 
appreciably. Neither a routine arrangement of tunes from Marvin Hamlisch's hit 
musical "A Chorus Line" nor a rousing rendition of two "Slavonic Dances" by 
Dvorak could put the wind back in the pops' sails. 
</P>
<P>
Sidlin urged the audience to vote for Ravel's "Bolero" for the program's 
finale, since the orchestra's rendition of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture," he 
claimed, would be anemic without the obligatory canons and bells. It turned out 
to be a bit of a compromise, however, since conductor and orchestra delivered a 
"Bolero" with the heavy-handedness usually reserved for the Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's attendance was a modest 1,739. This program continues at 7:30 
tonight and Saturday at Hospitality Point, although the fare will vary with 
each audience's proclivities. The program will be repeated in a free 7 p.m. 
concert Sunday at the Carlsbad Research Center.

MOVABLE FEASTS: CLASSIC CREOLE FARE AT HAROLD AND BELLE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L. N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cajun craze may have fizzled, but why should Creole restaurants suffer? 
Harold and Belle's, a 20-year old restaurant in the Crenshaw district, features 
Louisiana-bred food to eat-in or take-out . . . and no blackened you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
Partners Harold LeGaux and Al Honore are both descended from that scrumptious 
part of the world where French, Spanish, Portuguese and African recipes 
combined with indigenous ingredients (oysters, catfish, clams, shrimp) to form 
a New World cuisine, i.e. jambalaya, Po-boy sandwiches and gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
There are probably as many varieties of gumbo as there are cooks. Harold and 
Belle's version ($6.95 for a small portion, $11.95 for a large) uses file 
powder, with its earthy flavor from ground sassafras leaves, as a thickener and 
heaps of shrimp, crab, chicken, andouille and ham. The broth is complex and 
beautiful and meant to be lavishly spooned over the accompanying rice, or 
dunked with the huge slab of crisp French bread. The nubby sausage is 
particularly pleasing; only the woody chicken is a let-down. 
</P>
<P>
Po-boy sandwiches may have been created as a cheap way to feed hungry working 
men, but anyone eating Harold and Belle's catfish Po-boy ($7.75 including 
potato salad or steak fries) is one lucky guy. What a sandwich: a sweet 
white-fleshed catfish filet perfectly fried and mounded on a crusty foundation 
of French bread. It's all crunchy, juicy succulence. The soft-shell crab 
Po-boy's another contender for the sandwich hall of fame. It's dipped in a thin 
slip of cornmeal batter, fried up just right and then bathed in a fine ooze of 
mayonnaise. (Served only in season and market-priced, it's now $8.25.) 
</P>
<P>
I had several classic jambalayas earlier this year in New Orleans and found 
Harold and Belle's one-dish rice/chicken/sausage/ham/shrimp specialty 
plentiful, yet less distinctive than jambalaya from the source. Here, it's just 
too mild, just too well-blended. Order jambalaya as a dinner though ($11.95) 
and you get unusually sweet corn on the cob and a choice of a large fresh green 
salad or ultra-thick clam chowder which tightropes between deliciously peppery 
and too-floury. 
</P>
<P>
Fried seafood is central on the menu and the kitchen has a fine subtle hand. 
Louisiana oysters ($6.95 for an appetizer, $18.95 for a main course) are creamy 
within and crusty on the outside. All fried food tasted was crisp and fresh, 
not in the least greasy. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp Creole ($20.95) probably the best known Creole dish, is tender jumbo 
shrimp in a so-called "richly seasoned" onion, green-pepper and tomato based 
sauce that I found extremely mild. 
</P>
<P>
For more assertive flavoring, Harold and Belle's serves "Home Style Favorites," 
distinctively Southern dishes like red beans and rice and pork chops, Southern 
fried chicken and country-style ribs. I was sure that I'd had my best barbecue 
of the year back in New Orleans (courtesy the Second True Love Baptist Church) 
but Harold and Belle's no-knife-needed (and maybe no teeth) beefy ribs, with an 
elixir of a sauce, proved that addiction to Harold and Belle's could start with 
this dish. The enormous portion, at $16.95, would easily serve two. 
</P>
<P>
Fried chicken ($12.95) is also lusty and generous enough for two. Accompanying 
steak fries drooped on the way home but were easily revived to proper crispness 
in the oven. Red beans and rice served with three flavorful centercut pork 
chops ($14.95) would make a delicious introduction to this classic, slow-cooked 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, a sweet potato cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and a 
dousing of pralines on top was compelling; the too-sweet canned peach cobbler 
was not. I went back to those ribs. 
</P>
<P>

(213) 735-9918. Open Monday through Thursday noon to 10 p.m.; Friday noon to

COMEDY TAPES LOOK LIKE CONTENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the home-video boom started about five years ago, the comedy tape business 
was a joke. Video retailers were concentrating on renting movies and had no 
time for comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the multibillions earned from movie rentals, the revenues from 
comedy tapes are still laughably small. But the comedy home-video market took a 
big jump a few years ago and is still on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy tapes, incidentally, aren't movie comedies but non-theatrical programs, 
mostly of comics in concert. Some are compilations of skits, usually from TV. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry analyst Betsy Niesyn of the trade journal Home Video 
Publisher, comedy tapes did $50 million worth of business -- sales and rentals 
-- in 1987. Last year, the figure leaped to $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
How about this year? 
</P>
<P>
"It may go up to $140 million," she predicted. "Look for it to keep growing, 
but not by huge amounts. It's a small market but it's very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increase in comedy tape sales is the drop in price. Most 
comedy tapes now cost $19.95, down from $30-$40 three to four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That price reduction was possible because of a change in the marketplace. Like 
every non-theatrical genre, comedy benefited from the influx of the mass 
merchants -- discount chains like Target and K mart -- who now market 
low-priced tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jimirro, president/CEO of J2 Communications, cited another new outlet: 
"Comedy sells in music outlets, like Tower, Wherehouse and Music Plus."

As long as business was limited to retailers and rentals, comedy was doomed to 
a small share of the market, but as other sales outlets opened, comedy 
blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's mostly a sales market, with companies geared to doing volume 
business, putting out as much product as the market will bear," said Bill 
Perrault, marketing director of Vestron, which has released tapes by such 
comedians as Steve Martin, Robin Williams and Richard Pryor, and has an Andrew 
Dice Clay program on its fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
According to J2's Jimirro, most comedy tapes are former cable-TV specials -- 
mainly from HBO and Showtime. One reason original programs don't dominate the 
comedy market is that they're just too expensive to make. Acquiring the 
home-video rights to a cable comedy special is considerably cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Making an original program costs about three times what it costs to buy the 
rights of a cable show," said Jimirro. "An original program costs more and it's 
a greater risk." 
</P>
<P>
Still, J2 has had great success with original programming. The three tapes in 
its Dorf series, starring Tim Conway -- "Dorf on Golf," "Dorf and the First 
Games of Mount Olympus" and "Dorf's Golf Bible" -- have cumulatively sold 
360,000 units. All were originally priced at $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
But J2's next release is a former Showtime special, an 80-minute Louie Anderson 
show due out Oct. 12 at $39.95. Jimirro said the price is higher because, 
initially, J2 will sell it to retailers for the rental market. After some 
months, the company will lower the price, probably to $19.95, for the sales 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest stars in the market are Eddie Murphy and Bill Cosby. Murphy, whose 
tapes are released by Paramount, has a new one, "The Best of Eddie Murphy: 
Saturday Night Live" ($24.95), that should be the major new comedy title in the 
fall market and should wind up in the Top 10 of home-video comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the most recent list of best-selling comedy tapes, compiled last year by 
Niesyn of Home Video Publisher. She cautioned that while each title has sold 
more units since then, the relative positions probably haven't changed: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- "Bill Cosby: Forty-Nine" (Kodak, $19.99). 350,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- "Eddie Murphy Delirious" (Paramount, $19.95). 230,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- "The Best of John Belushi" (Warner, $19.98). 220,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- "Eddie Murphy Raw" (Paramount, $89.95) 200,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- "Dorf on Golf" (J2, $19.95) 190,000. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- "Bill Cosby Himself" (CBS-Fox, $19.98). 150,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- "The Best of Dan Aykroyd" (Warner, $19.98). 140,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- "Elephant Parts" (Pacific Arts, $39.95) 125,000 units.

STUDY FINDS DEPRESSION NOT A CANCER CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Undermining a popular belief that depression can play a role in the development 
of cancer, a 10-year federal study has found that people who experience 
depression are no more likely than others to come down with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The finding, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
contradicts a centuries-old hypothesis that has attracted new interest in 
recent years amid a growing curiosity about psychological factors in disease. 
</P>
<P>
"These findings should diminish any concern that people have about (depression) 
being an important factor" in cancer, said Bernard Fox, a professor of 
psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine and an expert in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biologic Processes 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, people should pay more attention to the biologic processes that 
stimulate cancer," Fox said. "For example, by not eating too much fat . . . 
stopping smoking . . . or avoiding carcinogens like radon and (chemicals) in 
the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
The findings, by researchers at the National Institute on Aging, run counter to 
those of a now-famous study published in 1981 that found that men with evidence 
of a high rate of depression were twice as likely as others to develop or die 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, other researchers have reached conflicting conclusions. But 
specialists in the field say there is a widely held belief among the public 
that depression can somehow contribute to the onset of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a danger, which is that people feel responsible for being sick," said 
George Kaplan of the California Department of Health Services. ". . . I don't 
think it's particularly useful to have people feel . . . that they are 
responsible for this disease." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we have to question whether it's a given that states of mental 
distress cause cancer," said David K. Wellisch, professor of medical psychology 
at UCLA School of Medicine. "Many people think that's a given. This (study) 
reminds us that it's not." 
</P>
<P>
The federal study looked only at the onset of cancer, not at survival among 
those already diagnosed with the disease. Researchers like Wellisch believe 
depression can play a critical role in accelerating the death of cancer 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I see that as life-threatening and life-limiting," Wellisch said, "because the 
patient who is depressed and who has cancer is . . . less prone to be able to 
cope with treatment and as a result faces greater risk of mortality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stanford Findings 
</P>
<P>
One recent study, reported in May by researchers at Stanford University, found 
that breast cancer patients who got emotional and social support through group 
therapy survived up to twice as long as patients on medical treatment alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the current study, the federal researchers tracked 6,403 men and women who 
had taken part in a federal health and nutrition study in the early 1970s. All 
had been examined using two standard psychological tests to gauge mental health 
and depression, and their hospital records were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Of those participants who appeared to suffer repeatedly from depression, 11% 
were diagnosed with cancer or died of it during the 10-year period of the 
depression study. Of those considered not depressed, 10% were diagnosed or 
died. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between 10% and 11% is not considered statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty clear from our results that people who are experiencing 
symptoms of depression need not be concerned that their symptoms are a risk for 
cancer," said Alan B. Zonderman, an author of the study and a psychologist at 
the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the load of evidence is consistent with either no real 
relationship or a very weak one," said Fox of Boston University School of 
Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial published in the journal. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of links between depression and cancer have existed at least since 
Galen, the 2nd-Century Greek physician and writer, researchers say. More 
recently, they received some support from observations and studies of people 
with serious psychiatric disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 study, which involved 2,020 men employed by the Western Electric Co. 
in Chicago, stimulated new interest in the subject. Since that time, several 
studies have appeared to contradict the 1981 finding while others have 
partially supported it. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been tremendous interest in that (1981) study," said Kaplan, chief 
of California's human population laboratory and the author of a contradictory 
study. Kaplan attributed that interest in part to the new field of so-called 
psychoneuroimmunology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature of Field 
</P>
<P>
Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of links between psychological states and 
the brain and the immune system. Researchers are exploring whether 
psychological conditions like bereavement can influence immune system 
functioning and one's ability to ward off disease. 
</P>
<P>
Why the studies have reached conflicting conclusions is unclear, researchers 
say. The answer may lie in methods used to measure depression. Different 
researchers have used different standardized tests, some of which may be 
insufficiently precise, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Shekelle, author of the 1981 study, said in a telephone interview 
Thursday that while his study supported the suggestion that depression "might 
promote the development and spread" of cancer, he never intended to assert it 
was a cause of the disease.

MOLDAVIA DEFIES KREMLIN ON LAW; 
</P>
<P>
REPUBLIC RESTRICTS USE OF RUSSIAN LANGUAGE; GORBACHEV APPEAL TOLD

<P>
KISHINEV, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiny Moldavia on Thursday became the latest republic to rebel against the 
Kremlin's plea for ethnic unity in the Soviet Union when its legislature 
approved a new law that will make Moldavian its official language. 
</P>
<P>
However, the law also includes compromise language, reached after President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev reportedly telephoned the Moldavian Communist Party leader 
this week, that allows the use of Russian in some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Moldavians who had gathered in Kishinev's Victory Square wildly 
cheered news of the vote, which was broadcast live on radio and television. 
People embraced, and some wept. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic moment, and I am recording it for my grandchildren," said 
Tudor Vrosz, 50. He was writing notes in Moldavian on a scrap of paper as he 
sat beneath a blue, yellow and red Moldavian flag. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to avoid violence, more than 100 police officers, 
standing shoulder to shoulder, ringed the Opera Theater where the legislators 
were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Russians Opposed 
</P>
<P>
The new law was opposed by ethnic Russians and other non-Moldavians who make up 
35% of the republic's population of 4.2 million. It calls for making Moldavian, 
a Latin language, the official language of all state and commercial documents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it stipulates that the language be written in the Latin alphabet 
instead of the Cyrillic script that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin imposed in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The law, approved after three days of stormy debate, provides for a grace 
period of up to seven years to allow for the linguistic transition. 
</P>
<P>
But in a clear attempt to appease non-Moldavians, the lawmakers agreed to 
retain Russian as a language that can be used between ethnic groups. It was not 
immediately clear that this would satisfy the non-indigenous population, whose 
workers have been on strike for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Russian activist, Anatoly M. Lisitsky, the compromise was 
hammered out after Gorbachev, now vacationing on the Black Sea, talked by 
telephone with party leader Semyon Grossu. Lisitsky, co-chairman of the 
non-Moldavian organization Unity, said Gorbachev's call helped give his group 
its first partial victory. 
</P>
<P>
"But the reason for the strike has not been eliminated," he said. "Our concern 
is that the basic rights of minorities are being violated. At best, this vote 
only stabilizes the situation for now." 
</P>
<P>
Moldavia is the fourth republic to approve a language law this year. Similar 
laws were passed in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nationalist Hysteria' 
</P>
<P>
The Moldavian law, even in its compromise form, was approved in defiance of 
warnings from Moscow, where a campaign was launched last week against what the 
official news media call "nationalist hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Moldavia, as well as the Baltic republics, was specifically cited as an example 
of a region where the desire for cultural freedom of expression has been 
carried to an extreme. 
</P>
<P>
The reported call to the Moldavian party leader would be at least the second 
such call Gorbachev has made to a local party chief in the past week. Earlier, 
he interrupted his vacation to call the Lithuanian party leader, whom he asked 
to cool nationalist fervor there. 
</P>
<P>
In Moldavia, opposition to the language law erupted more than a week ago and 
has been growing steadily. On Thursday, about 100,000 non-Moldavians stayed off 
the job to demonstrate their opposition. They shut down 211 factories and 
hampered air and rail traffic, according to a strike spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Strikers in the city of Tiraspol, the republic's second-largest city, even put 
out their own newspaper, explaining their position in poetry and prose. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to learning new things," said Sergei Migylyan, an ethnic 
Russian who has lived in Kishinev for five years. "We understand why Moldavians 
want to speak their own language. We just don't want things imposed on us by 
brute force. We think they should have made both Moldavian and Russian state 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri P. Tishenko, an ethnic Russian who is managing editor of the newspaper 
Sovietskaya Moldavia, warned that the decision to switch from the Cyrillic 
script could backfire on the Moldavians. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be nearly impossible for some people to learn, particularly the 
elderly," he said, "and it will be costly because everything must be changed -- 
everything from printing facilities to the price tags in shops." 
</P>
<P>
But such problems appeared to be far from the thoughts of the Moldavians 
gathered in Victory Square across from the Opera Theater, among them 
grandmothers in scarfs, young mothers with children, and men and boys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Floral Tributes at Statue 
</P>
<P>
During the vote, dozens of Moldavians placed flowers at the foot of a statue to 
Prince Stephen, a Moldavian ruler of the 15th Century. Some kissed the pedestal 
for luck. Others wore pins bearing the likeness of Mikhai Eminesku, considered 
by Moldavians to be their finest writer. 
</P>
<P>
Eminesku, who lived in the 19th Century, wrote love poems that are still 
recited here. But he also wrote essays calling for self-determination that were 
banned before Gorbachev became president. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to speak our language," said a man standing in the square who 
declined to give his name. "If the Russians don't like it, they can go home to 
Mother Russia." 
</P>
<P>
In the headquarters of the Popular Front nationalist movement, formed just 
three months ago, activists gathered around a television set to watch the 
parliamentary proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our awakening," said Yuri A. Rozkho, a member of the group's executive 
council. "There is no time to spare. If we do not free ourselves, if we are not 
permitted to develop culturally and linguistically, we Moldavians will die out 
as a people."

BOY, 14, SOUGHT TO JOIN FAMILY IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH AT BORDER SHOWS A DARK SIDE OF AMNESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He wanted to be with his father, so 14-year-old Luis Eduardo Hernandez left 
home in Mexico's Jalisco state two weeks ago and headed for Los Angeles, where 
his father, newly legalized under the amnesty program, works in construction. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others, Luis Eduardo was filled with hope for a new and better 
life as he made the passage north with his brother Angel, 15. And, also like 
many others, Luis Eduardo never made it beyond the tumult of the borderlands. A 
boy known for his sense of humor and curiosity, he died 30 feet inside the 
United States, in San Diego, run over early Aug. 20 by a U.S. Border Patrol 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, natives of Luis Eduardo's hometown of San Juan de los Lagos -- 
many now resettled in Boyle Heights -- buried him near the shade of a pepper 
tree in Los Angeles' Resurrection Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
His death, according to immigrant representatives, is a tragic testament to a 
darker side of the amnesty program. Now nearly 3 years old, the program has 
raised the possibility for permanent legal U.S. residence for more than 3 
million people, more than 70% of them from Mexico and half of them residents of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But immigrant rights activists point out that amnesty -- which provided no 
automatic benefit for spouses and children of the newly legalized -- also has 
served to split families into "legal" and "illegal" members, exacerbating the 
already deep divisions of the Mexican diaspora. Existing legal immigration 
procedures can leave families divided for a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to agree to be separate from their families," said Rodolfo 
Padilla, an uncle of the dead boy, as he stood outside the funeral home where 
the boy's remains lay Thursday. He pointed to his nearby preteen daughter, all 
smiles and little-girl frills. 
</P>
<P>
"My little girl," Padilla said, gesturing toward the child, "she crossed 
illegally, too." 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty, according to the Mexican consul general in San Diego, has prompted a 
huge increase in the number of unaccompanied minors, like Luis Eduardo, who are 
arriving at the border with the intention of joining newly legalized parents. 
The children, in groups and alone, can be seen nightly in Tijuana, crouching 
along the tattered fence that marks the international boundary, frightened but 
anxious for a chance to dart into the opportunity of the north. 
</P>
<P>
"We see them every day," said Marcela Merino, a Mexican consular official in 
San Diego. "They only want to be with their parents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face Range of Hazards 
</P>
<P>
At the border, they face a range of hazards, from unscrupulous smugglers, 
professional thieves, extortion-minded Mexican police and the intimidating grid 
of high-speed roadways that converge on Tijuana from San Diego. More than two 
dozen undocumented immigrants -- some of them children -- were struck by 
vehicles and killed as they walked along the border highways in San Diego last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol's motorized fleet adds to the danger, critics say. In the 
last four years, according to a San Diego human rights coalition, the patrol's 
vehicles have run over and killed at least six migrants in the 
California-Mexico border region. There have been calls for greater safety 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Luis Eduardo, U.S. authorities describe the incident as an 
unfortunate but unavoidable accident: The boy was running just north of the 
border fence when he fell in the path of the vehicle, which was traveling at 10 
to 15 m.p.h. and was unable to stop, according to the Border Patrol, a 
uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Padilla, a San Diego attorney representing the Hernandez family, 
asserted that the vehicle was driving at an excessive rate of speed. He plans a 
civil claim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Express Little Rancor 
</P>
<P>
Mourners for Luis Eduardo, who clearly believed that the boy had been the 
victim of an injustice, expressed little rancor. Most had themselves crossed 
the border at Tijuana at one time or another, and all seem to recognize the 
dangers -- and the reality that not all can make it. It is unfair, they say, 
but true. 
</P>
<P>
"We take great risks and expose ourselves to great dangers to come here," said 
Padilla, Luis Eduardo's uncle. "One risks one's life because in Mexico there is 
nothing for us any more." 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as Jose Munoz, a native of San Juan de los Lagos who has lived in 
Los Angeles for 30 years, spoke of the need for greater safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this should never have been allowed to happen," said Munoz, a 
laborer who has emerged as somewhat of a community activist among the San 
Juaneros, immigrants from San Juan, who clearly respect his studied thoughts 
and opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly," he said, "these agents are properly trained to deal with people, 
and then this happens." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to bury Luis Eduardo in Los Angeles was made in the hope that the 
family might someday be together in the city and be able to visit the grave 
site. 
</P>
<P>
A wake was held Wednesday night. Luis Eduardo lay in a felt-lined wooden casket 
as his family and former neighbors prayed. The body was dressed in a blue shirt 
and new blue jeans. Bruises, apparently from the accident, were still evident 
on the boy's face. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, there was another church service, preceding the burial. 
During his low-key eulogy at the Roman Catholic Church at Our Lady of the 
Rosary of Talpa, Father Honorio Lopez touched gently on the theme of 
"injustice" as he addressed the gathering of about 120 mourners. He consoled 
the family with images of a heavenly reunion. 
</P>
<P>
Too distraught to speak publicly were Luis Eduardo's parents, Aurelio and 
Amelia, and his three brothers and two sisters. The mother and other children 
had received temporary visas so they could travel legally to Los Angeles for 
the funeral. The visas expire later this month, and then they must return to 
Mexico.

COURT BACKS U.S. ON THE 55-M.P.H. LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Thursday upheld the 
right of the federal government to impose a 55-m.p.h. speed limit on highways 
by threatening to withhold highway construction money from states. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous opinion on the first challenge to the national speed limit, the 
court spurned claims by the state of Nevada that the federal government was 
using unfair coercion to get states to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling follows recent Supreme Court decisions on congressional spending 
power and on states' rights, according to constitutional scholars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Binding on States 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is binding on all the states in the 9th Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, 
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- plus Guam 
and the Mariana Islands. Several of those states have indicated that they would 
like to raise their speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, federal law has allowed states to set a higher speed limit on some 
stretches of rural highways and several Western states have done so. State 
officials said that 1,100 miles of interstate highways in California have a 65 
m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Huffaker, a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol, said the 
decision will not have any immediate impact in the state. "It will not affect 
the 65 m.p.h. limit that exists" on many of the state's rural roads, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Huffaker said California is already in compliance with the federal law, 
although, she said, the CHP is philosophically opposed to it: "We feel states 
are capable of setting and enforcing speed limits. That's within the state's 
realm of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power to Set Limits 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision, written by Appeals Court Judge Stephen Reinhardt and 
joined by Thomas Tang and Charles Wiggins, dealt straight on with the federal 
government's power to set limits on highway speed. Among the Nevada contentions 
it rejected was the argument that the 55 m.p.h. limit violated the 10th 
Amendment, which reserves to the states powers not delegated to the federal 
government by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt's opinion said his decision had its genesis in the Federal Aid 
Highway Act of 1916, under which the federal government provides funds directly 
to the states for maintenance of its highways. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, at the height of the energy crisis, Congress passed the Emergency 
Highway Energy Conservation Act, which became part of the Highway Act. The new 
law required all states that wanted federal highway funds to set speed limits 
of no higher than 55 m.p.h., including on roads that were not part of the 
interstate network. 
</P>
<P>
"While Congress did not order the states to conform their speed limits to the 
new standard," Reinhardt noted, "it imposed a draconian consequence for 
noncompliance: denial of all future federal highway grants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfair Hardship 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to Thursday's decision began in June, 1985, when the Nevada 
Legislature enacted a law increasing the speed limit on the state's highways to 
70 m.p.h., saying that the 55-m.p.h. limit imposed an unfair hardship on 
residents in the largely rural state. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation threatened to cut off $85 million of 
Nevada's federal highway funds if it did not lower the speed limit, according 
to Brooke A. Nielsen, Nevada's chief deputy attorney general. Nevada complied 
in order to keep the money flowing but filed a federal court suit seeking a 
ruling that the law was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Bruce R. Thompson in Reno issued a summary judgment in 
favor of the federal government, and his decision was affirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada has pegged its attack on the national speed limit on the wobbly legs of 
the coercion test," Reinhardt said. "While we strongly doubt the vitality of 
that theory, we conclude that alive or dead, it is of no consequence here. 
Congress could have mandated a national speed limit under its Commerce power: 
That it chose to enact a lesser restraint, by cutting off highway funds to 
states unwilling to adopt the designated limit, does not render its actions 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge Lost 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 Supreme Court case, South Dakota lost a challenge to a provision of 
the Highway Act that held that a state could lose its federal highway money if 
it set a drinking age under 21. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thursday's case has greater significance, Nielsen said, because South 
Dakota would have lost only 5% of its highway money, whereas Nevada stood to 
lose 95% of its funds. Nielsen said that Nevada attorney Brian McKay would have 
to thoroughly review the decision before deciding whether to appeal to the 
Supreme Court.

ETHICS-SALARY BALLOT MEASURE CLEARS SENATE

<P>
The Senate unanimously passed wide-ranging ethics legislation Thursday that 
would let voters decide whether to ban honorariums and limit gifts for 
lawmakers, while setting the stage for a legislative pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitutional amendment, the centerpiece of the Senate's proposal 
to upgrade the ethics of the Legislature, would limit legislators' outside 
income, toughen conflict-of-interest rules and restrict lobbying by former top 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the measure would offer legislators the hope of a substantial 
pay raise by setting up a commission to review whether their $40,816 annual 
salary and $88-a-day expense allowance amount to adequate compensation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under a Cloud 
</P>
<P>
"We in the Senate are serious about passing major ethics reform," said Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the author of the 
legislation. "There is a cloud right now hanging over our operations and it is 
incumbent upon every one of us to do everything we can to try to remove that 
cloud." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's image has been seriously eroded during the last year -- in 
part because of an ongoing FBI investigation into political corruption. So far, 
one legislator has been indicted -- Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) on 
extortion and racketeering charges. Montoya joined his colleagues in voting for 
Roberti's measure. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendment, approved on a vote of 35 to 0, would be placed 
before the voters in June, 1990. It now goes to the Assembly, where legislators 
are attempting to reach agreement on their own package of ethics proposals that 
in some respects is tougher than the Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both the Assembly and Senate have expressed optimism that the two 
houses can agree on a plan and adopt some form of ethics legislation before 
Sept. 15, when the Legislature adjourns for the year. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Legislature and the voters, Roberti's proposed 
constitutional amendment would: 
</P>
<P>
Ban all honorariums for legislators and other elected state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Limit gifts to $250 from a single source per year, with exceptions for gifts 
from family members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Prohibit elected state officials from receiving income from a lobbyist or an 
interest group that employs a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Enact separate legislation prohibiting former legislators from lobbying the 
Legislature for 12 months after leaving office and prohibiting former top 
executive branch officials from lobbying their former agencies for the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti moved Thursday to strengthen his proposal by requiring that the 
Legislature put teeth into its lax conflict-of-interest laws. Under current 
law, legislators are prohibited from voting on measures that affect their own 
financial interests, but there is no penalty for violations. Roberti's 
amendment brings his proposal more in line with the Assembly plan. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, he softened the measure with an amendment removing a limit on 
the amount of money legislators could earn in outside income. Under his 
original proposal, legislators would have been prohibited from receiving 
outside income totaling more than 30% of their salary. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate leader also said he will amend his proposal to prohibit closed-door 
meetings of legislative bodies, except for discussions of personnel matters, 
security matters or pending litigation. Private meetings of the Democratic and 
Republican caucuses of each house also would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this legislation, while not perfect, moves a great deal forward in 
trying to address many of the issues that the public perceives -- in most cases 
quite correctly -- as ethical questions," Roberti told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen whether the voters care enough about questions of 
legislative ethics to pass a constitutional amendment that is likely to give 
legislators a hefty pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the plan argue that legislators have come to depend on honorariums 
and other outside income because they do not receive enough in salary and 
expense allowances to maintain residences in both the capital and their 
districts. Some legislators say their salary should be more in keeping with 
that of Superior Court judges, who receive $84,765 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti contended that it would be a "reform" to remove the Legislature's power 
to set its own salary and put it in the hands of an outside commission 
appointed by the governor.

5,000 PROTESTING DEATHS OF 2 BLACKS SHUT BROOKLYN BRIDGE; SUSPECT HELD 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 5,000 demonstrators protesting the slaying of a black teen-ager in 
the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and the killing of former Black Panther 
leader Huey Newton in Oakland closed the Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday, but were 
thwarted by police when they tried to march on City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
As the marchers, carrying twin coffins and chanting: "No Justice, No Death," 
were met at the Brooklyn end of the bridge by a massive outpouring of police, 
violence broke out. Bottles and sticks were thrown at police. At least 23 
officers were injured and at least five protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Massive traffic jams were created by the demonstration and by a police order 
shutting down subway stations at both ends of the bridge to prevent protesters 
from crossing into Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic scene capped a day of fast-moving developments in the Bensonhurst 
case, including the arrest of the prime suspect in the killing of 16-year-old 
Yusef Hawkins a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Fama, 18, the subject of an intense manhunt, surrendered Thursday in 
Oneonta in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He was running like hell and scared to death and knew that we were breathing 
on his heels," said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward after Fama was returned 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have told police that Fama shot Hawkins after a crowd of 30 or more 
whites, some carrying baseball bats, had surrounded Hawkins and three black 
friends, who had entered the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used 
car. Police said the four blacks were mistaken for friends of a white woman in 
the neighborhood, who earlier had reportedly jilted one of the attackers for a 
black. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Hawkins has become a symbol of racial divisiveness in the city 
and has taken center stage in New York City's closely contested mayoral 
primary. The killing was one of the worst racial incidents in New York since 
1986, when a black man was chased into traffic on a busy highway and killed by 
a speeding car in the Queens neighborhood of Howard Beach near Kennedy Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after Hawkins' killing, leaders in New York from all major 
religious groups have appealed for calm. But the demonstration Thursday raised 
new fears of heightened tensions in the days before the mayoral primary on 
Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Several extremely bitter demonstrations have been held in Bensonhurst. Scenes 
of protesters being jeered by whites, some of whom held up watermelons, have 
been shown on television and have changed the climate of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins' funeral Wednesday in a small, yellow brick church attracted most of 
the mayoral contenders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. All but David Dinkins, who is 
seeking to become New York's first black mayor and whom polls show running 
virtually even with three-term Mayor Edward I. Koch, were booed by crowds in 
the predominantly black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to mitigate tensions in the Bensonhurst case, black clergymen and 
clergymen from the troubled Brooklyn neighborhood met on Thursday with local 
leaders in a church in the area of small shops and homes. Dinkins attended the 
gathering. Afterward, all agreed that church bells in Bensonhurst would ring 
Sunday in the name of racial peace. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Brooklyn preacher without a pulpit, who had taken 
part in the Bensonhurst marches, on Wednesday called for a "day of outrage" 
demonstration for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Halted on Avenue 
</P>
<P>
At one point the march stretched for more than half a mile through downtown 
Brooklyn, halting traffic on Flatbush Avenue, one of the area's main arteries. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an absolute success!" Sonny Carson, a black community leader, told 
the Associated Press. "This will make the city wake up. This will let the city 
know that there are young black people who will not take this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
After the violence at the foot of the bridge, many of the demonstrators marched 
down Fulton Street into the predominantly black area of Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
</P>
<P>
Passing a white-owned pizza parlor, some of the demonstrators, shouting slogans 
against the police and against Italian-Americans, told blacks eating inside the 
pizzeria to get out. The owner quickly closed the shop as the taunts of the 
crowd rang out in the gathering dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Newton's slaying, the second focus of the protest, occurred a day earlier than 
Hawkins' shooting. Oakland police described Newton's death as a drug-related 
homicide. Authorities have ascribed no racial motivations to his death and no 
arrest has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Before the New York protest, New York City detectives drove to Oneonta and 
placed Fama under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Oneonta police Sgt. Joe Redmond told United Press International that Fama, 
wearing blue jeans and a gray sweat shirt, had arrived at 2 a.m. in the police 
station in the small city, which is dominated by two colleges and sits in the 
middle of rolling dairy farmland about 40 miles southwest of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
"He hitchhiked up here. He doesn't know anybody in the area," Redmond said. "He 
had no place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Describing Fama as nervous and frightened, Redmond said Fama "had just been 
eating potato chips and sodas, picking a sandwich up here and there, and he 
just decided to come in. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked tired and had a couple day's growth of beard." 
</P>
<P>
A Brooklyn grand jury Wednesday indicted two suspects on charges of 
second-degree murder and other charges in the attack. Four other Bensonhurst 
youths have been charged but not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's murder indictments were a surprise because police had said they 
were still seeking the suspected gunman. Officials, however, said the pair were 
charged for their alleged complicity in the attack.

COURT HEARS S. DAKOTA-INDIAN DISPUTE OVER JURISDICTION OF RESERVATION ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ROSEBUD, S.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many a traffic cop, Willard Bordeaux stopped a speeder the other day. But 
what Bordeaux then reported to headquarters is anything but typical. 
</P>
<P>
"Subject is a non-Indian," crackled the voice of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
patrolman over the police radio. "Released with a warning." 
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux had no choice. The incident took place on U.S. 18 in the heart of the 
Rosebud Sioux Indian reservation, a remote, barren expanse of stubby pastures 
and ramshackle homes astride the Nebraska border. It is also one of the few 
places in the nation where justice, by design, is not blind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jurisdiction Limited 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a complex legal thicket that envelopes the administration of Rosebud, 
as well as many other Indian reservations around the country, the federal BIA 
police are the law here but still have no jurisdiction over the nearly 1,000 
whites who live on reservation land. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the county sheriff and a local policeman in the reservation 
town of Mission, both of whom are white, can not arrest or ticket Indians. And 
the state highway patrol pretty much steers clear of roads in Rosebud 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least it has up to now. In what could be a landmark legal battle pitting 
safety concerns against Indian autonomy and dignity, South Dakota and tribal 
officials are fighting in the federal courts over jurisdiction on the highways 
at Rosebud and other reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The state says it should have control and points to a serious alcohol problem 
on the reservations that has led to an accident fatality rate at Rosebud three 
times the statewide average. At the neighboring Pine Ridge reservation, 
patrolled solely by an Oglala Sioux tribal police force, the highway death toll 
is five times the South Dakota norm, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Power Grab 
</P>
<P>
But tribal leaders, who have vowed to keep state troopers off Pine Ridge and 
Rosebud no matter what the courts decide, claim that the statistics are 
misleading and that the state action is a thinly veiled attempt by hostile 
whites to seize power over Indian land. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there's still a cowboy and Indian mentality, a redneck 
mentality, on the part of many (white) people out here," charged Cora Jones, 
the BIA agency superintendent at Rosebud. 
</P>
<P>
Viola Burnette, the attorney general of the Rosebud tribe, sees the highway 
dispute as part of a much broader struggle with the state. "They're chipping 
away at our jurisdiction," she said. "First they chip at the highways, then 
they chip at hunting and fishing rights, then I don't know what. They'll 
continue trying their best to get control of what happens on the reservations." 
</P>
<P>
The state won the first round in the courts last March when U.S. District Judge 
Donald J. Porter, acting in a suit initiated by the Rosebud tribe, said Indian 
authorities must share jurisdiction over reservation traffic with South Dakota 
police. Nevertheless, both sides insist they should have exclusive control and 
have appealed Porter's ruling to a federal appellate panel in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. George S. Mickleson, a Republican, has ordered 
state troopers to stay off Pine Ridge and Rosebud until some kind of 
accommodation can be worked out with tribal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations such as Rosebud are theoretically sovereign lands, little nations 
within a nation guaranteed to the various tribes by treaties sometimes a 
century or more old. Subsequent court decisions and acts of Congress, however, 
have significantly diluted tribal powers and drastically reduced the original 
size of many Indian homelands. 
</P>
<P>
Still, individual reservations have their own governments and courts as well as 
educational and law enforcement systems -- all largely paid for with federal 
stipends. Indians who live on reservations are exempt from many state taxes and 
laws, yet are considered state citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Pummelled by decades of land grabs, slights, deceptions and out-and-out 
harassment, many Indians are wary of any governmental actions perceived as 
restricting an already diminished capacity to control their own destiny. On the 
other hand, many whites resent the special privileges and legal status afforded 
Indians and suggest the reservation bureaucracy itself is to blame for turning 
Indian lands into bleak islands of poverty where joblessness can run as high as 
90%. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, South Dakota Atty. Gen. Roger Tellinghuisen, a Republican, created an 
uproar earlier this year when he publicly suggested that reservations were an 
antiquated, "divisive form of government." In the wake of widespread criticism, 
Tellinghuisen later apologized. But Indian leaders claim the remark reflects 
the attitude of many whites in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friction Evident 
</P>
<P>
True or not, jurisdictional friction is evident on several fronts in South 
Dakota. For example, Tellinghuisen's office has lent support to businessmen in 
a lawsuit to block Rosebud's tribal government from regulating non-Indian owned 
commercial enterprises on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, state officials suspended bids for state-funded road repair 
projects at Rosebud when tribal officials demanded that disputes between 
contractors and workers be mediated in tribal courts. There are also simmering 
arguments over quality controls for water sources that cut across reservations, 
as well as hunting and fishing rights for non-Indians on Indian land. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, at least, the highway battle is at center stage. The 
controversy has its roots in a 1953 federal law, passed in an era when Congress 
was actively trying to integrate Indians into the mainstream of American 
society, that granted outright authority over civil and criminal jurisdiction 
in Indian country to certain states. Other states, including South Dakota, were 
given the option of taking on such duties. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, South Dakota's response to that statute has been confusing and 
contradictory. State lawmakers did, at one point, pass legislation to assume 
traffic duty on reservations, but enforcement of the statute was effectively 
blocked by a 1964 order of the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Informal Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
Even so, state troopers worked out informal power-sharing arrangements with 
officials on some reservations. Under an unwritten agreement, state highway 
patrols have routinely cruised the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux 
reservations in the northern part of the state and issued citations to Indians 
which are recognized by tribal courts. Even at Rosebud, tribal officials 
periodically ask troopers to enter the reservation to conduct safety 
inspections of Indian school buses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, however, the Rosebud tribe filed suit against the state after troopers 
issued a handful of tickets to Indians on reservation land. Despite their 
ongoing working relationship with the state, both the Cheyenne River and 
Standing Rock tribes later joined in the legal action, as did the Oglala tribe 
at Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling on the case last March, Judge Porter agreed with state arguments that a 
highway patrol presence on reservation highways could reduce lawlessness and 
drunk driving and save lives. And Porter, citing cost estimates for increased 
patrols, rejected arguments that state officials were making a power grab to 
snatch traffic ticket revenue from the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
According to evidence provided to Porter by the state, the statewide highway 
death toll averaged 2.98 fatalities for every 100 million miles driven between 
1977 and 1986. During the same decade, the death rate at Rosebud was 10.25 
fatalities per 100 million miles and at Pine Ridge it was a startling 17.01. 
Tribal officials claim the numbers distort the problem, but offer little 
evidence to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticizes Officials 
</P>
<P>
Also buttressing the state's argument was an affidavit from a former officer on 
the federal police force at Rosebud. He claimed that Rosebud officials 
routinely used clout to thwart criminal prosecutions in the tribal court and 
that Indian judges rarely, if ever, sentenced tribal members to jail for drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a pattern like this, it's just too much," argued John Guhin, the 
deputy attorney general in charge of the highway case. " . . . A lot of these 
(Indian) officers are good officers and they try hard, but we think we can do a 
better job. We have to ask ourselves, can we just sit here and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The answer from tribal leaders, of course, is "yes." They question whether 
South Dakota taxpayers will be willing to spend hundreds of thousands of 
dollars annually for increased traffic control on reservations. And they claim 
that Indians, who frequently complain of being hassled by state troopers off 
the reservation, will strongly resent a highway patrol presence on the 
reservation.

SOVIET DELEGATES SEE NATIONALIST THREAT

Nationality conflicts in the Soviet Union threaten the reform process and could 
explode into civil wars unless the disputes are resolved by constitutional 
changes, visiting deputies from the new Soviet parliament said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Their candid appraisal came amid reports from Moscow of a hardening attitude by 
the Kremlin leadership toward challenges by the Baltic republics of Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania. Demands for greater autonomy have also led to nationalist 
unrest in Moldavia, Georgia and other regions. 
</P>
<P>
"The (political) system as it is cannot be preserved or it would lead only to 
tragic consequences," said Nikolai V. Fyodorov, a newly elected deputy of the 
new Supreme Soviet, a parliamentary body of 500 members set up to replace its 
rubber-stamp predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Equal Partners' Doctrine 
</P>
<P>
A new Soviet constitution under consideration, he said, would establish a union 
based on an "equal partners" doctrine that would attempt to satisfy nationalist 
feelings in the Baltic republics and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a solution, there will be a great sharpening of the situation, with 
emergency procedures or martial law in certain republics, with counteractions," 
Fyodorov added. "It would be very similar to a civil war." 
</P>
<P>
Andrei E. Sebentsov, an electrical engineer from Moscow who is also a new 
deputy, agreed that the nationality disputes are "very serious and create the 
possibility of great conflicts" that he said would strengthen the position of 
conservatives who oppose President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of 
perestroika, or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
But Sebentsov said it is childish for groups in the Baltic republics to think 
that secession from the Soviet Union is the only way to achieve their 
nationalist aspirations. Greater autonomy, he said, could resolve many of their 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Konstantin D. Lubenchenko, head of the visiting delegation, added that the 
crisis over nationality problems requires creation of a new Soviet economic 
system that would include greater use of market incentives and introduce the 
concept of private property as well. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes, he said, would create an economic incentive for the Baltic 
republics to remain part of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, together with three staff aides, came to the United States to 
study the day-to-day workings of Congress in hopes of applying some American 
techniques to the new Soviet parliament. The deputies spoke to reporters 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Lubenchenko said that he and the two other deputies are members of a Supreme 
Soviet committee on legislation, legality and law and order that will have a 
strong influence on the procedures adopted by the new body. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic voting, he said, will be used to speed its work and also let Soviet 
citizens know, for the first time, how their representatives vote. In the past, 
the Supreme Soviet almost invariably gave unanimous approval to recommendations 
of Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impressed With Data 
</P>
<P>
"About two-thirds of the deputies did not want roll calls published," said 
Sebentsov. "It may be hard for some deputies, but they'll just have to get used 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov said the delegation is impressed by the amount of information that 
members of Congress have available to evaluate executive proposals and help 
them draft legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we establish independent sources of information, . . . we will not be 
able to establish freedom and democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet delegation went to the Supreme Court as well as Congress and will 
spend Labor Day weekend in Salt Lake City to meet with Rep. Wayne Owens 
(D-Utah) and city and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Describing their pioneering efforts to construct a democratic legislature, 
Lubenchenko said: "You should think of us as bricklayers, building a house 
without a blueprint, but we desire to build a very good house."

BICYCLE-CART BOMB INJURES 8 IN COCAINE CAPITAL

A terrorist bomb in a bicycle cart wounded eight persons and caused heavy 
damage Thursday in the city of Medellin, where defiant drug traffickers have 
been waging a terrorist campaign for the past week. A threatening telephone 
call warned of more casualties to come. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion at mid-morning Thursday hit Colombia's biggest paint factory on 
busy San Diego Avenue. An anonymous caller told radio stations that the blast 
was set off by "the Extraditables," a grouping of Colombians wanted for drug 
trafficking in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The latest of 18 bomb explosions in Medellin during the past week, it was the 
first during daylight hours. The caller claiming responsibility said the 
bombers have changed their hours because of a night curfew decreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"At night, when the bombs were placed, there were fewer victims, but now there 
will be more because they will be placed in daytime, when there are more people 
circulating," Radio Caracol quoted the caller as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Someone left the juice and ice cream vendor's cart near the Pintuco paint 
factory on the south side of Medellin. When the cart bomb exploded, debris 
thrown by the blast hit at least eight people in the area, police and radio 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those wounded were workers or passers-by. The blast tore a large hole 
in the paint factory's wall, shattered windows of buildings on the street and 
damaged more than 20 cars, some of them in a nearby automobile agency. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an initial report of one death, police said Thursday evening that no 
one was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Bombs killed one man Aug. 26 and another Sunday, but none of the previous 
blasts had wounded as many people as the one Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, about two hours before Medellin's new 10 p.m. curfew 
began, grenades exploded at the city's Club Campestre, Spanish for "country 
club," and at an installation of the government petroleum company. No one was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
During the night, more than 1,000 people were detained temporarily for being on 
the streets in violation of the curfew. Police held violators in a soccer 
stadium, releasing all but two on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb campaign appears to be aimed at eroding public support for an official 
crackdown on cocaine traffickers. The government blitz, which has included 
hundreds of successful raids by security forces, began on the same day two 
weeks ago that assassins killed a leading presidential candidate and the 
Medellin police commander. 
</P>
<P>
Medellin is the home of Colombia's most powerful and violent cocaine 
trafficking cartel. Luis Carlos Galan, the assassinated politician, was an 
outspoken opponent of the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Defense Department in Washington said that as many as 100 U.S. 
military personnel will be sent to Colombia over the next four months to help 
train police and military units in this country's battle against the drug 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the personnel will be sent perhaps 
starting Sunday, when two already-scheduled C-130 cargo aircraft carry military 
equipment to Colombia.

ISRAELI WHO TRAINED COLOMBIANS SAYS HE WAS 'NAIVE'

<P>
Yair Klein, an anti-terrorist instructor whose students in Colombia have been 
linked to drug-related killings, concedes that most of what he knew about 
Colombia before going there last year he learned from high school textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
And what he learned since then, he says in defense of himself, may not have 
been enough to ensure that his training was not used for criminal ends. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Klein said there was no way to be sure that none of 
his students worked for drug lords or that none were involved in the 
assassination of a Colombian presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible someone in the course killed Galan," he said. "All the time, we 
were sure we were working with farmers, but if one or two worked with (drug 
lords), we couldn't know. If after we left they worked for them, we couldn't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anonymous 'Visitors' 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he did not know the narcotics figures reported to have appeared in a 
videotape produced to promote Klein's services. But he recalled that anonymous 
"visitors" once toured the training site at the invitation of the cattlemen who 
he says employed him. 
</P>
<P>
If something went wrong, he said, it was because he was an innocent abroad, 
adding: "Do you know any genuine fighters who are not naive? Yes, there was 
naivete in this." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, 46, a retired Israeli army colonel, is at the center of a storm here and 
abroad over his military training operation in Colombia. In Colombia, police 
say he instructed hit squads at the service of major cocaine operators. Some of 
his graduates, Colombians charge, shot and killed Galan. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Klein is the focus of a national debate over the role of retired 
soldiers in spreading weapons and military know-how abroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Questions 
</P>
<P>
Israelis are wondering not only how such activity might have gone on under the 
noses of Defense Ministry officials, who are supposed to control exports of 
Israeli military hardware and know-how. They are also asking how former members 
of their armed forces could have become enmeshed in a sordid business in a 
far-off place. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Dan Meridor said: "There has been serious injury to Israel's 
image, to the image of the (Israel Defense Forces). It is important that it 
remains positive, of a patriotic army conducting a righteous war in a moral 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Klein and four of his colleagues -- Amazia Shauli, Yitzhak Shoshani, Dror Eyal 
and Teddy Melkin -- have been questioned by police here. All are retired 
paratroopers. All worked in Klein's security firm, Hod Hahanit, which in Hebrew 
means Spearhead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permits Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry officials said Hod Hahanit operated in Colombia without the 
permits needed to export military hardware and technology. The officials said 
they knew nothing of his activities. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said it repeatedly reported on the 
activities of Israelis in Colombia, leaving open the possibility that the 
Defense Ministry was aware of Klein's work but did nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he needed no permit because he was teaching civilians for a private 
company. He said he was working for ranchers, protecting them against leftist 
guerrillas, but he declined to name any of the people who hired him. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has long sought to sell its surplus war materiel abroad, in places as 
distant as Singapore and Paraguay. Latin America became an important market for 
Israel in the late 1970s, when the United States cut off or curtailed military 
supplies to a number of governments accused of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Past Embarrassment 
</P>
<P>
The export of military technology is an open secret, one that has led to 
embarrassment on several occasions. Israeli trainers have been linked to armed 
movements led by Idi Amin in Uganda, to repressive measures taken in Guatemala 
in its war on guerrillas, and to security protection for Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, the Panamanian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
"What are our wonderful boys doing in Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, 
Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and not just those places?" the independent 
newspaper Hadashot asked in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
This week a parliamentary committee began studying new legal controls on 
military exports. 
</P>
<P>
Klein is not apologetic about training others in warfare, saying he thinks he 
is defending free nations against an onslaught of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an expert in war against terrorists and an expert in war against 
guerrillas," he said. "I am brave and a little adventurous. Not many people 
have the character to go in to teach war in a place where the guerrillas are 
surrounding you." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, with ice-blue eyes, close-cropped hair and military pedigree, almost 
fits the stereotype of the Israeli warrior. He was born on a kibbutz, the 
nurturing ground of numerous war heroes. Fresh out of technical school, he 
joined Company 890, Israel's first elite paratroop unit. He commanded 
helicopter troops, and he speaks in low tones of secret "anti-terrorist" 
operations he conducted. 
</P>
<P>
He served in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars, and after retiring in 1979 he 
opened a restaurant and ran a service station. But that life was too tame. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a restless spirit," he said. "Some people like to knit. I like to help 
people defend themselves. I go in where the government can't go, where it can't 
allow its name to be used." 
</P>
<P>
He said his company sold clothing and equipment to Christian Falangist militias 
based in Beirut, and he sold similar equipment, he said, to the South Lebanon 
Army, a militia allied to Israel along the Israeli-Lebanese border. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he extended his operations to other parts of the world. He declined to 
say where, but newspapers here listed Guatemala as one client, and Klein did 
not deny this. 
</P>
<P>
A friend introduced Klein to business in Colombia, and his first opportunity 
was offered by banana growers who said they needed help in defending themselves 
against guerrillas. But the deal collapsed before the training could start. 
</P>
<P>
Then a cattle cooperative known as ACDEGAM stepped in. Its herds had been cut 
in half by guerrilla raids, Klein said. The course he would provide supposedly 
had the backing of Colombian government officials and military officers. 
Colombian troops sometimes visited the camp, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he offered a three-week course to about 50 peasants and then 
returned to give another three-week course to new students. But he began to 
notice media reports about his activity, he said, and there was criticism of 
paramilitary training inspired by leftist political parties that sympathized 
with the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he folded his operation before a third course could be started, 
leaving only a pair of trainers to teach the Colombians how to detect bombs in 
mailed packages. Klein said he netted $20,000 from the job. 
</P>
<P>
On graduation day last spring, one of Klein's trainers directed the making of a 
videotape that showed Klein leading his students on a charge up a hill. In it 
appears a man whom Colombian police identified as Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, an 
accused leader of the Medellin drug cartel, along with a man identified as 
Alfredo Vaquero, who is said to head the cartel's paramilitary operation. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that if such men appeared on the video, he was ignorant of their 
identities.

EPA ACTS TO SHARPLY CUT EMISSIONS OF BENZENE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN WOULD REDUCE INDUSTRIAL FUMES BY 90%; CHANGE IN COMPOSITION OF GASOLINE TO 
BE ORDERED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government moved Thursday to sharply restrict industrial emissions 
of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical widely used in manufacturing and found in 
automobile exhaust fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency, in announcing the restrictions -- some of 
which are proposals and some that take effect immediately -- said that exposure 
to benzene "represents an important long-term health concern," particularly for 
individuals who live near major industrial sources of the pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations are directed at a diverse group of manufacturers as well as the 
nation's gasoline marketing network, including 390,000 service stations across 
the country. Affected industries include steel, petroleum, chemicals, 
pharmaceuticals and tire manufacturing. The regulations would also affect 
railroad tank cars and benzene storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The agency predicted that the controls would reduce industrial emissions of 
benzene by 90%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petroleum Derivative 
</P>
<P>
Benzene, a derivative of petroleum, is a major industrial chemical associated 
with adult leukemia. It is used in the manufacture of plastics, insecticides 
and polyurethane foam. Benzene emissions are also found in automobile exhaust 
fumes, automobile refueling operations, cigarette smoke and many consumer 
products. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials acknowledged at a press conference, however, that industrial 
emissions of benzene account for only about 20% of total airborne benzene, with 
the remainder coming from vehicle exhaust and fuel evaporation. They said that 
they intend to attack the automobile problem through additional regulations 
that would require changes in the composition of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that about half of the American population is exposed to 
benzene emissions from industrial sources and that "virtually all of the 
population is exposed to benzene as a constituent of gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
For most Americans, however, the risk of cancer from benzene exposure is about 
one in a million, the agency said, noting that the proposed regulations are 
designed to protect an estimated 100 million people who live close to 
industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules are intended to ensure that those facing the biggest exposure -- 
an estimated 300,000 people -- have no more than one chance in 10,000 of 
getting cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen were generally positive about the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"EPA has taken additional steps to protect public health, but has done so in a 
manner that recognizes the efforts already taken by the petroleum industry to 
reduce its emissions," the American Petroleum Institute said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Proposals Criticized 
</P>
<P>
But the institute criticized the proposals to limit emissions in the gasoline 
marketing network. Those provisions would require the addition of seals and 
other systems to reduce the estimated 5,300 tons of benzene released through 
the filling of underground gasoline storage tanks at service stations. 
</P>
<P>
"These particular controls would require significant expenditures of 
approximately $1 billion but would achieve virtually no public health 
benefits," the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said that the proposed restrictions would reduce the projected 
incidence of leukemia from approximately four additional cases per year in the 
exposed population to one case every three years. 
</P>
<P>
One set of final regulations that took effect Thursday requires a 97% reduction 
in emissions from coke byproduct recovery plants and "significant" reductions 
in emissions from benzene storage plants. 
</P>
<P>
The agency proposed also a second set of regulations to require a 98% cut in 
emissions from railroad tank cars, trucks, boats and other transfer operations, 
a 95% reduction from process vents in pharmaceutical manufacturing, a 75% 
reduction from rubber tire manufacturing and additional reductions from benzene 
waste operations, gasoline terminals, plants and service stations. The proposed 
regulations would take effect after a period of public comment. 
</P>
<P>
For the petroleum industry, the EPA proposed that benzene storage facilities 
larger than 10,000 gallons meet specific requirements for tank roof seals, 
including periodic inspections and repair of broken seals. The agency predicted 
that benzene emissions from such tanks will be reduced from a current level of 
680 to 1,420 tons a year to an estimated 560 tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency proposed controls on waste operations at chemical 
plants, petroleum refineries and other facilities that would require covers or 
enclosures, treatment processes and waste incineration to reduce emissions at 
these facilities to 275 tons a year, a 95% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Most consumers will not be affected by EPA's regulations at the gas pump, 
because emissions released when automobiles are refueled already are subject in 
many cities to controls that exceed federal ozone smog standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20,000-Ton Reduction 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said that the final rules that were adopted Thursday will result in a 
reduction of 20,000 tons of benzene emissions from current levels within two 
years. The pending proposals would eliminate an additional 14,300 tons when 
they take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that its benzene rules represent its first attempt to satisfy a 
landmark 1987 federal court ruling requiring the EPA to go through an elaborate 
health risk assessment process in deciding how far industries must go to reduce 
toxic air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the EPA to determine what constitutes an "acceptable" level 
of risk for the public from dangerous air emissions, then impose 
pollution-control requirements that provide an "ample margin of safety." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling resulted from a lawsuit filed by environmental groups that attacked 
the agency for taking industry costs into consideration, in addition to health 
factors, in determining its standards for air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials have said that the court-ordered process takes too long. It cited 
the ruling as a major reason why the agency has regulated only eight out of the 
hundreds of toxic air pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected to override the process set up by the courts when it 
revises the Clean Air Act. The Bush Administration's clean air bill would 
require industry to first install the best available pollution control 
technology and then have the EPA evaluate remaining health dangers to decide 
whether further regulation is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In California, no ambient air standard has been set for benzene. But benzene 
emissions are regulated indirectly because they fall into a general category of 
chemicals known as volatile organic compounds, which are a prime ingredient of 
photochemical smog.

2ND GENERIC DRUG-SWITCHING CASE REPORTED

Federal officials are investigating Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. for possible fraud 
in connection with the approval of a generic version of the brand-name 
anti-depressant drug Mellaril. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable officials said Thursday that both the Food and Drug 
Administration and the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee are 
looking into charges that Bolar fraudulently submitted the brand-name drug 
instead of the generic version to a testing laboratory -- the second such 
incident reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Reportedly Corrected 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that the mistake was corrected at the time and that 
Bolar's generic drug ultimately was tested and approved. The generic drug now 
on the market, of the chemical thioridazine, is identical to Mellaril and is 
safe and effective, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff that's being marketed is the real thing," FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Bolar, which is in Copiague, N. Y., could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this week that Bolar, one of the nation's largest 
manufacturers of generic drugs, has become embroiled in the broadening federal 
investigation of charges that some generics have been improperly tested and 
marketed. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA announced Monday that it will withdraw approval of Bolar's generic 
equivalent of Dyazide, a leading blood pressure drug. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Bolar's generic equivalent of Mellaril is based on a 1982 
letter in which Pharmakinetics Laboratories Inc. of Baltimore told Bolar that 
it believed Bolar had submitted Mellaril tablets instead of its own generic 
equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determining Equivalency 
</P>
<P>
It was Pharmakinetics' job to determine whether Bolar's generic was chemically 
equivalent to Mellaril, which is manufactured by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmakinetics refused to comment specifically on its testing of Bolar's 
generic drug. But it said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Seven years ago, in 1982, Pharmakinetics refused to conduct bio-equivalency 
studies on tablets supplied to the company by a pharmaceutical manufacturer. 
This refusal was based on the Pharmakinetics' personnel visual inspection of 
four batches of test tablets, which caused then-company officials to question 
the true identify of the product." 
</P>

U.S. STEPS UP RESEARCH INTO RECENT CLIMATE CHANGES 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, responding to fears of a global warming trend, 
Thursday announced a stepped-up research effort to determine if recently 
observed changes in the Earth's atmosphere are the result of human activity or 
largely natural. 
</P>
<P>
The White House Office of Science and Technology said that the government will 
spend $191.5 million for research on "global change" during the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1, a 43% increase over this year's spending level. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than attacking a particular phenomenon such as the "greenhouse effect," 
the government is planning a broad research program to extend over a decade and 
study everything from ocean currents to prehistoric rock formations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to gain an understanding of how this planet ticks," said Bob 
Corell of the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural or Man-Made? 
</P>
<P>
The research is necessary, officials said, because scientists do not know to 
what extent the climatic changes are caused by the cycles of nature extending 
over millions of years and to what extent they have been caused by man-made 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that the gases that are known to be increasing in the atmosphere, 
such as methane, have both natural and man-made sources. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about global warming has been heightened by recent British studies 
concluding that 1988 was the warmest year worldwide in the 130 years since 
official records have been kept. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, atmospheric studies have detected a sharp rise in carbon dioxide, 
fueling fears that the pollutant may be causing global temperatures to rise by 
trapping the sun's reflected heat within the atmosphere: the "greenhouse 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
"Responding to these changes without a strong scientific basis could be futile 
and very costly," said a Bush Administration research report on "Our Changing 
Planet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predict Changes 
</P>
<P>
A key goal of the intensified effort will be to "separate out the natural and 
human-induced changes," Corell said. By the mid-1990s, scientists said that 
they hope to have models that can predict future changes in the atmosphere and 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
White House Science Adviser D. Allan Bromley said in a statement accompanying 
the research plan that the expanded effort reflects President Bush's concern 
for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Because in the coming decades global environment change may well represent the 
most significant societal, environmental and economic challenges facing the 
United States and the world," Bromley said, "the President has endorsed the 
goal of the U.S. program to develop a predictive understanding of global 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The research plan was put together by an interagency group called the Committee 
on Earth Sciences. But the dozens of separate research projects will remain 
under the control of a variety of agencies, such as the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. 
Geological Survey and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new spending already has been approved by Congress, said Dallas 
Peck, chairman of the coordinating committee. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental advocates were quick to applaud the expanded research effort. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant step, a real increase in funding," said William Moomaw, 
director of the climate, energy and pollution program at the World Resources 
Institute in Washington. "This seems to have been one of those rare times when 
you have the agencies working together in a good spirit of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon MacDonald, a scientist who headed a recent study urging more support for 
climate research, said that some of the new research money announced Thursday 
may "simply be relabeling and repackaging. You have to be an accountant to 
track it all." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he called the research plan "a hopeful step. It's a sign of real 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take years of careful observation to know whether the temperature is 
really changing and what is causing it. Right now, we have a very poor idea of 
how much of it is natural and how much is man-made," MacDonald said.

The 865-foot Singaporean tanker Minerva spilled at least 1,000 gallons of crude 
oil Thursday into the Delaware River while discharging cargo at a refinery, a 
Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary reports indicate that human error may be responsible," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard initially reported the spill at 4,200 gallons. A slick extended 
4 1/2 miles downriver. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Minerva, owned by Argo Dua Shipping PTE Ltd. of 
Singapore, and the refinery immediately notified authorities and put 
containment booms around the tanker, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship hired a pollution contractor, which deployed a boat and trucks to 
vacuum up the crude. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Jery Scheddel said spills of less than 10,000 gallons are 
considered minor on the Delaware.

BID TO AMEND INITIATIVE SUFFERS SETBACK

A politically charged Democratic effort to amend the so-called "speedy trial" 
initiative to assure that women's abortion rights are not tampered with 
suffered a potentially fatal setback Thursday in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), the Democratic floor leader, failed by a wide 
margin when he asked the Senate to permit a quick committee hearing on the 
legislation. Without a prompt hearing, the Legislature cannot consider the 
proposal before adjourning for the year Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has taken on heavy political overtones because the speedy trial 
initiative is backed by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is expected to be the 
Republican nominee for governor next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed by Sponsors 
</P>
<P>
One of the Democrats who would like to challenge Wilson, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp, has been leading the attack on the speedy trial initiative. Van de 
Kamp charges that provisions of the initiative repealing privacy rights granted 
to prisoners also would throw out the same privacy principles that have 
established abortion rights in California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner came up with the idea of a second 
initiative that would not have the offensive language in it, thereby allowing 
pro-choice Democrats to support the anti-crime measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Keene's measure was opposed by sponsors of the speedy trial initiative, who 
claimed that Van de Kamp's interpretation is legally unsound and politically 
motivated to embarrass Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
What Keene wanted Thursday was the Senate's waiver of a provision of the state 
Constitution that requires a 30-day public notice before any legislation can be 
considered by a committee. 
</P>
<P>
He introduced his proposed constitutional amendment -- nearly identical to the 
initiative backed by Wilson, except that it does not contain the controversial 
wording that some view as a threat to abortion rights -- only last Friday. And 
with the Legislature scheduled to adjourn Sept. 15, Keene does not have time to 
wait the legally required 30 days to have his bill heard and still make it 
through both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 17 to 15. But Keene needed 30 votes, or three-fourths of the 
40-member house, to waive the rule. Keene couldn't round up a single Republican 
vote in support of his effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keene Challenged 
</P>
<P>
Keene argued that his legislation is needed to "clarify" the disputed language 
of the speedy trial initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of his measure challenged Keene's contention and also said they 
suspected that he was simply trying to undermine Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), one of those who voted against the rule waiver, 
said, "The privacy provisions of the initiative are very important to law 
enforcement in California. . . . I don't think it's a threat to abortion 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who also voted against Keene, said the 
Democratic leader's motives were "transparent" and a "ploy" to damage the 
initiative and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
After Keene lost the vote, he said he would "go back to the drawing board." But 
he acknowledged that his failed effort to waive the 30-day hearing rule was 
probably the Democrats' "last shot" at getting a hearing on the alternative 
measure before the end of the year. He said he did not know whether he would 
try again in January.

ANTI-ABORTION LEADER SOBS ON WITNESS STAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, in the dramatic highlight of 
anti-abortion activists' trespass trial, broke into sobs on the witness stand 
Thursday as he described a Good Friday rally in which funeral services were 
held for an "aborted baby." 
</P>
<P>
With his voice cracking, Terry sobbed, "That night there were 2,000 of us 
filing past the dead baby in the coffin . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Before he could testify further, Los Angeles Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez, 
who has shown impatience with the defense tactics throughout the three-week 
trial of five Operation Rescue leaders, said, "Mr. Terry, do you want a break?" 
</P>
<P>
Terry, his body shuddering, gulped, "No, I'll be OK . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"You will take a break, Mr. Terry," retorted Paez, who has been trying to keep 
a taut rein on what he called the "circus-like atmosphere" of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a charismatic church leader from Binghamton, N.Y., has led his "holy 
army" in a series of nationwide demonstrations at woman's clinics. He is the 
last defendant to testify in the trial of five Operation Rescue activists 
charged with trespassing, conspiracy and resisting arrest during a March 25 
protest at a clinic on Westmoreland Avenue. Also charged are Jeff White, 31, of 
Santa Cruz; Andrew Eppink, 41, of Palmdale; Michael McMonagle, 36, of 
Philadelphia, and Don Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
During the half-hour recess, Terry remained seated on the witness stand, his 
back to the courtroom packed with his Bible-carrying supporters. His muffled 
sobs could be heard, and his shoulders were heaving. He continually wiped at 
his eyes with a handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, with Terry still hunched in his seat, Deputy City Atty. 
Lara Bloomquist rolled her eyes toward the ceiling and said, "At some point 
doesn't this become counterproductive?" 
</P>
<P>
When the jury returned, a somber Terry testified that during the rally at a 
church in Orange County, "It took two hours for the crowd to file by the coffin 
. . . of the 20-week-old aborted baby." 
</P>
<P>
The fetus, nicknamed "Baby Choice," Terry said later outside the courtroom, was 
used by anti-abortion activists during press conferences and other appearances 
the week they conducted "rescues" in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, Paez has threatened the defense with contempt for 
referring to the medical clinics as "killing centers," and "abortion mills." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was no exception. Less than 10 minutes into his testimony describing 
the sit-in, Terry used the word "aboratorium." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Mr. Terry, into my chambers!" Paez said sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Out of earshot of the jury, Paez threatened Terry with contempt if he continued 
to use words that might "inflame the jury," court officials said. Terry argued 
that the words were not used for effect but were "second nature" to him. Terry 
testified that he had been named in 20 court injunctions nationwide forbidding 
him from blockading woman's clinics. "The bottom line is that the injunctions 
are meaningless and I have given them no more attention than a piece of paper 
laying in the street." 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Terry said, the arresting officers at the sit-in threw him 
down into a mud puddle. "Someone put a foot on me and pushed my face into the 
pavement, and tried to bend back my finger . . . all I could think of was don't 
break my finger, because I play the piano . . . then they dragged me to the 
bus." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue protesters have argued that their actions at the sit-in are 
based on the "defense of necessity" -- breaking laws in order to prevent harm 
or "significant evil." But Paez rejected this defense because abortion is legal 
in California.

Former Seattle Seahawks General Manager Michael Blatt was arrested Thursday on 
a murder charge for allegedly paying two men to kill -- with an arrow through 
the chest -- Blatt's former business associate. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Lawrence Carnegie, originally from Van Nuys, occurred Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Blatt, a sports agent, Stockton developer and former business partner of the 
victim, served as interim general manager of the National Football League's 
Seahawks in February. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin County coroner's office said Carnegie, a Stockton real estate 
agent, was shot with an arrow, either from a bow or crossbow. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities previously arrested Carl Hancock Jr., 25, and James Mackey, 26, and 
said they were paid to kill Carnegie.

LABOR DEPT. ORDERS SAFETY LOCKS ON PLANT MACHINERY

The federal government Thursday gave 631,000 factories and plants two months to 
install locks so that power to machinery is cut off during maintenance and 
repairs, a step the Labor Department said will save 120 lives a year. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the new rule will affect 39 million American workers, most 
of them in manufacturing and service industries, and estimated that it will 
also prevent 60,000 injuries a year, 28,000 of them serious, such as loss of 
limbs or crushed bones. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost the affected establishments $214 million in the next year for the 
necessary equipment and training and $135 million in subsequent years, the 
department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. Those costs 
will range from $120 for small establishments -- such as a small print shop -- 
to $28,000 for large plants with scores of machines, OSHA said. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation, 10 years in the making, is tougher in its final form than when 
it was proposed. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the government proposed requiring that employers either install locks 
or place warning tags on the power source to alert workers that the machinery 
was being worked on and was not to be activated. 
</P>
<P>
But the final rule released Thursday places far greater emphasis on locks, 
allowing tags only when an employer can prove that equipment cannot be "locked" 
or that its tag program is as effective as locks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many fatalities, loss of fingers, crushed bones and other serious 
injuries because these precautions are not taken," said Alan McMillan, acting 
chief of OSHA. "This will have a major effect on workplace safety." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kinney, executive director of the National Safe Workplace Institute, a 
nonprofit job safety organization that has been bitterly critical of OSHA in 
the past, praised the issuance of the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standard's Applications 
</P>
<P>
The standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing and in services 
such as industrial laundries. OSHA data shows that packaging and wrapping 
equipment, printing presses and conveyors account for a high proportion of 
accidents blamed on a failure to cut off power during major maintenance and 
repairs.

Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday that it is recalling about 18,000 1988 and 
1989 Scorpio luxury sedans with 2.9-liter engines to replace a throttle 
position sensor. A spokesman said a bad sensor could cause the engine idle to 
be high or rough in neutral or park, or could cause the motor to stumble when 
placed in gear.

This nominally Marxist government says it will let faith healers, handicapped 
people and members of religious groups seek parliamentary seats for the first 
time in elections this month. 
</P>
<P>
Peasants and members of scholarly societies also may field candidates in 
elections Sept. 24, the Congolese Workers' Party decided at a special meeting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The party set quotas, which were not announced, for each of the groups and said 
the change would make Parliament more representative of society. In the past, 
only members of the Congolese Workers' Party or sympathizers were allowed to 
sit in Parliament.

REPUBLICANS SHOOT DOWN RESOLUTION ON ART FUNDING

After angry Republican speeches calling for its defeat, the state Senate on 
Thursday shot down a resolution that would have urged Congress not to cut 
federal funding of art deemed obscene or offensive to religious, racial or 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans blasted the resolution by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) which 
would have asked Congress to review selection standards for taxpayer-supported 
art instead of restricting funding. 
</P>
<P>
A leading opponent of the resolution, Sen. Larry Stirling (R-La Mesa), 
declared: "We should be financing what's good about America, and what can be 
better -- not the twisted, moronic, demonic, asinine, stupidity of some artist 
who can't sell his works on the open market, and so (he) has to get some 
leftist to get the government to finance it for him." 
</P>
<P>
The measure was defeated on a 14-19 vote, with 21 votes needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washington Debate 
</P>
<P>
In bringing up the issue, the Senate joined the debate raging in Washington 
over two exhibits of controversial photographs supported by the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) proposed restrictions on art funding after 
outrage erupted over Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix submerged in a 
jar of urine and an exhibit of homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, 
who recently died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said that only a small fraction of federally funded art is as "clearly 
offensive" as those exhibits and that the Helms proposal could allow for 
censorship in virtually all areas of artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the Helms amendment, material could not be published that denigrates 
Satanism or witchcraft. Shall we shelve Beethoven's . . . Ninth Symphony 
because it's about war, and might offend Quakers?" Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling and other Republicans said Helms' proposal addresses the responsible 
spending of public money and has little to do with censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists can still bite the heads off chickens and all that nonsense . . . as 
long as they don't do it with government money," Stirling said.

EX-STATE OFFICIAL TELLS OF JOB AT LINCOLN PARENT; 
</P>
<P>
APPROVED A BOND SALE FOR AMERICAN CONTINENTAL, LATER TOOK POST AT FIRM 
</P>

Franklin Tom, who was state corporations commissioner when the department 
approved now-bankrupt American Continental Corp.'s ill-fated sale of $200 
million in bonds, went to work for the company within weeks of leaving the 
state post, it was revealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although it had been known that Tom represented the firm in 1988, it had not 
been revealed that he worked for the firm almost immediately upon leaving his 
state job at the end of February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires department heads to wait at least 12 months before they 
lobby their former departments. 
</P>
<P>
Tom insisted in testimony before an Assembly subcommittee on savings and loans 
that he violated no law. He said he merely requested on behalf of American 
Continental that the department transfer its file on the company from its San 
Francisco to the Los Angeles office. The file was moved from the San Francisco 
office as a result. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo written at that time, a Department of Corporations official, noting 
that Tom was American Continental's attorney, said he told Tom of his concern 
that the company had a debt of more than $1 billion and that he thought it 
could not meet its obligations. 
</P>
<P>
In April, American Continental Corp. declared bankruptcy, and regulators seized 
its main subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. As many as 23,000 
investors, many of them elderly Southern Californians, invested in those bonds, 
only to find that they held little more than paper. 
</P>
<P>
In frenzied final months before American Continental declared bankruptcy in 
April, the company sold "$100 million worth of worthless paper," peddling the 
bonds at Lincoln branches, said Joseph W. Cotchett, a Burlingame lawyer 
representing many of the investors. 
</P>
<P>
In emotional testimony before the committee chaired by Assemblyman Patrick 
Johnston (D-Stockton), two elderly investors told how they thought the bonds 
were safe investments because their neighborhood thrift had offered them for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Leah F. Kane told of investing $15,000 of her $25,000 nest egg in the bonds 
after the manager of Lincoln's branch near her home in Leisure World told her: 
"You have nothing to worry about; this is an excellent investment." 
</P>
<P>
Tom sat stoically as Kane, who since has helped organize scores of Leisure 
World retirees who invested in the bonds, charged that Charles H. Keating Jr., 
owner of American Continental, is "some kind of sociopath, a man who delights 
in taking money from seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Johnston, Tom acknowledged that was commissioner of the 
state Department of Corporations -- a gubernatorial appointment -- in 1986, 
when the department first approved the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
But he testified that he knew nothing about the offering, even though his old 
law firm represented Lincoln before the department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spotlight on Law Firm 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, Tom returned to his law firm, Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara 
&amp; Samuelian, in Los Angeles, which had among its clients Lincoln and 
American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental chairman Keating long had a reputation for winning 
government approval of his various projects by hiring his former regulators. He 
also has donated heavily to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the attention has focused on Democratic recipients of Keating's 
largesse, Thursday's hearing spotlighted Tom's law firm, in which a partner, 
Karl Samuelian, is a chief fundraiser for Gov. George Deukmejian, who appointed 
Tom. Deukmejian received more than $40,000 in campaign donations from Keating 
and his companies and associates. 
</P>
<P>
Once 12 months had passed, Tom openly represented Keating before his former 
agency, appearing before Christine Bender, who replaced Tom as commissioner. 
Bender went to work for the Department of Corporations six years ago after 
working as an attorney at Parker, Milliken. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is you complied with the letter of the law," Johnston told Tom, 
noting that he had waited only the minimum period before returning to lobby his 
former agency. 
</P>
<P>
"That is my understanding of my obligation," Tom replied. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Johnston, Bender said she was not intimidated that her 
former boss, and the law firm for which she had worked, represented Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tom, along with several other former commissioners appear regularly before 
the department," Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
Documents released or referred to in the hearing detailed the depth of concern 
about Lincoln's bonds by lower-level state regulators in 1987 and 1988. One 
1988 memo by a savings and loan regulator referred to the bond sales as a 
"Ponzi scheme."

Boeing Wins Two Orders: Air Canada said it placed an order with Boeing Aircraft 
for six Boeing 767-300ER jets worth an estimated $590 million and placed 
options for another 12 of the planes. The total value of the contract is about 
$1.8 billion. Deliveries of the 767-300 extended range, or ER, jetliners are 
scheduled to begin in 1993. Aloha Airlines announced that it has ordered four 
new Boeing 737-300 series aircraft with options on four additional 737-300s. 
The total value of the order is about $250 million. Deliveries of the aircraft 
begin November, 1992.

Homes Less Affordable in July: Homes in the United States became less 
affordable in July as higher prices offset lower mortgage rates, the National 
Assn. of Realtors said. The NAR said the housing affordability index, which 
tracks home buying ability, was 98.0 in July, down from 99.1 in June. At 98.0, 
a family earning the median income of $32,876 had 98% of the income needed to 
qualify for conventional financing covering 80% of a home priced at $96,400. 
The association said the national median price for existing homes of $96,400 
was an increase of $3,000 from June. In the West, a family earning $34,907 had 
only 73.5% of the income needed to purchase a home priced at $138,200.

Inside Trader Gets 5 Years: A corporate merger lawyer convicted of fraud, 
racketeering and tax evasion was sentenced to five years in prison in what a 
prosecutor said was the longest jail term ever imposed in an insider trading 
case. "You are a brilliant, talented man who could have accomplished anything 
you wanted to in the practice of law, but there is a dark side to that talent," 
U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen said in sentencing Alfred Elliott. The judge 
also fined Elliott $332,000 and ordered the forfeiture under federal 
racketeering statutes of more than $350,000 in profits resulting from illegal 
stock trades.

Kaiser Aluminum Finishes Restructuring: Oakland-based Kaiser Aluminum said it 
sold its 20% stake in Boyne Smelters Ltd. of Australia for an undisclosed 
amount. As a result, Kaiser "has substantially completed" its restructuring 
program, the company said. Kaiser Aluminum, which is owned by Los Angeles-based 
Maxxam Inc., has received net cash proceeds of about $452 million from the sale 
of various assets so far this year. Most of the money was used to retire debt, 
which now stands at about $220 million, down from $606 million at the end of 
1988.

GOLDSMITH SAYS BAT BID DOOMED UNLESS EXTENDED

Sir James Goldsmith, one of the three financiers leading the hostile takeover 
bid for BAT Industries PLC, said Thursday that a British regulatory panel must 
extend its deadline or his takeover attempt will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all conditions of a bid, 
including U.S. regulatory hurdles, must be completed within 81 days of the 
posting of the bidder's formal offer document. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see the offer 
succeeding," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., posted its $21.4-billion 
(13.4-billion-pound) bid for BAT and its U.S. subsidiaries on Aug. 8, which 
leaves the group 58 days to meet U.S. regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has significant 
interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S. 
holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field department stores and 
Farmers Insurance Group. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith on Thursday also launched an attack on regulatory commissions in 
several U.S. states "for obstructing the bid."

Jobs Ads Down From a Year Ago: The volume of help-wanted job advertising in 51 
of the nation's major newspapers rose in July but was significantly below 
year-ago levels, the Conference Board reported. The board's seasonally adjusted 
help-wanted advertising index rose 3 points to 149 in July after a three-month 
string of declines. About 63% of the papers reported rising want-ad volume. In 
July, 1988, the index was 160 and slightly more than 70% of newspapers reported 
rising ad volume.

NEW PORTABLE MAC IS A MIXED BAG

Apple Computer Inc.'s first portable Macintosh will be heavy, bulky and 
expensive, but it will also have one of the sharpest screens in the business, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Apple, which plans to announce the new portable Sept. 20, did not cut any 
corners with its long-awaited portable, even if doing so would have produced a 
more affordable and easier-to-carry computer, according to people familiar with 
the product. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to be, on one machine, everything to everyone. Which Apple has 
always done, especially in the Macintosh line," said Richard Meyeroff, a 
computer consultant in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The portable Mac is expected to be priced at more than $6,000 and weigh about 
17 pounds, making it more costly and heavier than the latest IBM-compatible 
laptop computers. It is powered either by wall current or an internal, 
rechargeable lead-acid battery. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, its flat, flip-up screen is expected to be unusually large 
and sharp, with 1 million picture elements in a 1,000-by-1,000 array. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp picture is important because many people use Macintoshes for design 
work. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome the slowness of most flat screens, Apple has attached a separate 
transistor to each picture element, or pixel, so the screen responds almost 
instantaneously, analysts say. The screen's biggest drawback is that it is 
somewhat hard to read in dim light, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Devoted users of the Macintosh for years have seen fellow travelers being able 
to tap away on their laptop versions of Tandys, Zeniths, Toshibas and NECs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Called Laptop 
</P>
<P>
Apple has said it was not ready to bring out a portable Mac because the 
technology for one was not adequate. That apparently has changed. 
</P>
<P>
In private showings Apple has been careful not to call the new machine a 
laptop, which would imply it is lighter than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
"People are calling it the Paul Bunyan laptop," said Dan Ruby, editor of 
MacWeek in San Francisco, a weekly newspaper that has broken information about 
the forthcoming machine. 
</P>
<P>
Laptops are the fastest-growing portion of the personal computer market and 
have spawned their own smaller offspring, notebook computers, which weigh 
roughly 4 pounds and slip into an average briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby said Apple's decision not to sell a pared-down, lightweight laptop version 
of the Macintosh is typical of the company's attitude: "When it comes to design 
stuff they're rather arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is, I'd like Apple to take a look at what Toshiba's done 
with the line of portables they have. That should give them a better idea of 
what the market's looking for," Meyeroff said. 
</P>
<P>
Apple declined to respond Thursday to comment and speculation about its machine 
before the Sept. 20 announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Apple won't quite have the portable Macintosh market all to itself. Several 
small companies make fully legal Mac compatibles, billed as add-ons

APPAREL, DEPARTMENT STORES STAND OUT IN RETAIL REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's biggest retailers on Thursday issued mixed sales reports for 
August, with apparel retailers and department stores faring better than mass 
merchandisers during the back-to-school season. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts continued to detect signs that consumers are still hesitant 
about making big purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw good sales in the apparel department, but many of the other departments 
show a cautious consumer," said Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not boom times," Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Indicator 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., agreed that 
although consumers generally are in a strong financial position and are 
confident right now, "spending is drifting sideways." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and 
retail sales are considered a key indicator of spending trends. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have cut back on purchases of what are called discretionary items -- 
as opposed to necessities such as food -- because of rising mortgage payments 
and other credit costs. 
</P>
<P>
Sales trends take on added importance at this time of year because August marks 
the beginning of the retailers' most critical season. Shopping generally 
accelerates in mid-August as families prepare for the new school year and then 
continues to build through the holiday season, when stores earn about half 
their annual profits. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer caution has hurt big general store owners such as the nation's largest 
retailer, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Sears said its August sales were up 2.3% 
overall, but sales at stores open at least a year -- known as same-store or 
comparable-store sales -- fell 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers and analysts consider same-store sales a more accurate reflection of 
a company's performance than totals that include sales at recently opened 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Another mass merchandiser, K mart Corp., also had a disappointing August, with 
overall sales up 4.8% and same-store sales up 1.5%.

Internal Revenue Service responded to business pressure Thursday and delayed 
for two months implementing a tax rule that encourages companies to provide 
health and life insurance benefits to all their workers. 
</P>
<P>
The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rules is Dec. 1, the 
IRS said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate that health and 
accident plans and group life insurance do not favor higher-paid workers. The 
original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had been delayed until Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Opposite Effect 
</P>
<P>
Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether, arguing that 
it is so complex, costly and time consuming that it will drive some small 
companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended and that companies 
are dropping benefits rather than extend them to all workers. 
</P>
<P>
Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in Congress. One, which has 
passed both the House and Senate but must be reconciled before going to 
President Bush, would delay implementation until Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A second bill, passed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the full 
Senate, would revamp but not rescind the rules and postpone the effective date 
until Jan. 1.

FORMER STATE S&amp;L COMMISSIONER LAWRENCE TAGGART; 
</P>
<P>
EX-REGULATOR'S RULING ON LINCOLN QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence W. Taggart, former commissioner of the California Department of 
Savings and Loan, made a ruling favorable to Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in late 
1984, a month before he left office to join a firm that then received a 
$2.9-million investment from the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart acknowledged Thursday that he gave Irvine-based Lincoln approval in 
December, 1984, to put $800 million into subsidiaries that were allowed to make 
direct investments in real estate, securities and other risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, 1985, Taggart left office to join TCS Financial Inc., a San 
Diego-based financial services firm. About three weeks later, Lincoln invested 
nearly $2.9 million in TCS to pick up a 19.1% stake in the firm's initial 
public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's top thrift regulator at the time, Edwin J. Gray, said Thursday 
that Taggart was "lining up (future) clients rather than regulating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultant to S&amp;Ls 
</P>
<P>
Taggart has become a target of criticism in recent years for permitting 
speculative practices by S&amp;Ls -- even though they were allowed by law -- 
that some critics say caused the industry's multibillion-dollar debacle and led 
to the recently enacted bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been criticized for agreeing to consult for S&amp;L executives who 
were running their institutions into the ground with risky business strategies. 
Taggart said he has offered his services to those most in need -- troubled 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving his state post, Taggart has tried to devise new business plans 
for such insolvent institutions as Vernon Savings &amp; Loan in Texas, which 
failed in 1987 when regulators said that 96% of its loans were bad. The failure 
cost the government $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
He also headed a subsidiary of Trafalgar Holdings, the company that Charles W. 
Knapp founded after being ousted from American Savings &amp; Loan. Knapp's 
policies were blamed for leading American Savings into insolvency and costing 
the government $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to Lincoln, Taggart denied that there was any "quid pro quo" in his 
actions toward the S&amp;L while he held public office. He said in an interview 
that he didn't even know in January, 1985, that Lincoln had bought TCS stock. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Stickel, the founder of TCS Financial (now called TCS Enterprises) 
and a prominent state Republican with ties to Gov. George Deukmejian, said it 
was "absolutely ridiculous" to suggest that Taggart had anything to do with 
Lincoln's investment in TCS. In fact, Stickel went on, the investment came only 
after he (Stickel) met with Charles H. Keating Jr., whose Phoenix-based 
company, American Continental Corp., owned Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved Application 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy protection. Regulators recently declared Lincoln insolvent and 
put it in receivership. The S&amp;L is projected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 
billion to sell or close, which would be the nation's costliest thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart became the state's S&amp;L commissioner in 1983 as industry 
deregulation was attracting numerous real estate developers and other 
entrepreneurs into the business. In early 1984, he approved American 
Continental's $51-million purchase of Lincoln. It was one of about 150 
applications he approved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, though, Lincoln was aggressive, embarking on rapid growth 
through investments. The S&amp;L rapidly turned away from making traditional 
home loans in favor of funding large real estate developments. The new 
direction was permitted under the industry's deregulation, which allowed 
S&amp;Ls to invest federally insured deposits in a variety of risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said Lincoln was often asking approval for one type of investment or 
another. Through 1984, he said, he approved about half of Lincoln's requests. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was becoming 
alarmed about the new investments that some S&amp;Ls were making, and he 
proposed a rule that would force all S&amp;Ls to limit direct investments to 
10% of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1984, Lincoln applied to move $800 million into subsidiaries that would 
be allowed by the new rule to continue making direct investments. Gray's rule 
was adopted in early 1985, and "grandfathered" such transfers of cash made 
before Dec. 10, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, 1984, Taggart approved the transfer, thus allowing Lincoln to beat 
what would become the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hit it Off' 
</P>
<P>
A month earlier, Taggart had announced he would step down as commissioner at 
the end of the year. He said no one but Stickel knew that he would join TCS. 
Stickel, a self-made millionaire, said he had been trying to lure Taggart from 
his post for most of that year. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, Taggart said, Keating called him to arrange a consulting 
contract, and the former commissioner said he took Stickel with him to Phoenix 
to meet Keating. From there, he said, Stickel and Keating "hit it off" and 
began working on deals he was unaware of. 
</P>
<P>
TCS, for instance, invested $400,000 in the Hotel Pontchartrain in downtown 
Detroit and received a 4% interest in the hotel. A partnership in which Lincoln 
was a general partner and Keating one of the limited partners owns the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's $2.9-million investment in TCS was more than half the $4.3 million 
the company raised in the stock offering. It bolstered the 18-month-old firm, 
which had been losing money from start-up costs, Stickel said. 
</P>
<P>
TCS lost $1 million in its first two years, but had earned $1.3 million in the 
next three years. It posted net income of $538,000 for the first six months of 
its fiscal year ended April 30.

TWIRLING DERVISHES; 
</P>
<P>
FOR 40 YEARS, LAGUNA HILLS' LOU GREENLEAF HAS TAUGHT GIRLS HOW TO BRANDISH A 
BATON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the hands of Becky Gast, age 5, an ordinary baton is nothing less than a 
lethal weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde sprite with big brown eyes whips the metal rod around like a 
baseball bat, accidentally whacking her 7-year-old sister Mandy on the head. 
When she tosses the baton in the air for a big finish, her fellow twirlers dive 
for cover. 
</P>
<P>
It can be a dangerous job teaching youngsters to twirl a baton, and nobody 
knows that better than Lou Greenleaf. For 40 years, the Laguna Hills resident 
has been taking girls with fumble fingers and turning them into world-champion 
baton twirlers. 
</P>
<P>
Her students, most of whom are Orange County residents ranging in age from 5 to 
20, typically capture a pile of trophies at state, regional, national and world 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"If I put 15 girls in a state meet, we'll bring home 70 awards and trophies. 
That's a lot," Greenleaf says. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Greenleaf and two students -- Veena Goel, 7, and Cassie Montelius, 
8, both of Laguna Hills -- returned home from the National Baton Twirling 
Assn.'s world meet in Indiana with 20 more trophies to add to their 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
Goel won 15 trophies, including a first place for solo baton in the advanced 
division, and Montelius won five trophies, including a first place for flag 
baton and third place for solo baton in the beginners' division. 
</P>
<P>
Still, anyone familiar with Greenleaf's methods knows she cares less about 
bringing home trophies than she does about building character. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls learn to win and lose. They learn to struggle and achieve. It makes 
them better people," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
In Greenleaf's classes, which meet at parks and schools in South Orange County, 
the children learn as much about the power of positive thinking as they do 
about twirling. 
</P>
<P>
Greenleaf stands before half a dozen 5- to 8-year-olds from her beginners' 
class in the courtyard of La Paz Intermediate School in Mission Viejo on a 
recent Wednesday afternoon. She absent-mindedly spins her baton around like a 
propeller as she addresses the students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to learn a new trick today," she says. "It's a hard one. Can we do 
this twirl?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," comes the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's humanly possible," they chant, reciting one of Greenleaf's 
favorite homilies. 
</P>
<P>
Greenleaf balances the baton on her raised elbow. The girls attempt to imitate 
her. A couple of the batons tumble to the ground. Greenleaf patiently readjusts 
the batons, pausing now and then to tweak a nose and pat a head. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep your arm up, sweet pea," she says to one girl. 
</P>
<P>
Step by step, she leads them through the maneuver, rotating the baton around 
with her elbows and catching it behind her back. One girl spins and catches the 
baton on her second try. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it mean if somebody does something before you?" Greenleaf asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing!" shout the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? The tortoise won the race 
because he kept trying. I ask God for lots of tortoises. Now, which are we 
going to be?" 
</P>
<P>
"The hare?" volunteers one tot who has missed the moral of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"The tortoise!" Greenleaf says. 
</P>
<P>
Greenleaf motivates her young charges through a combination of cajoling, 
encouragement and blatant bribery. Younger students get candy or money if they 
meet the lofty goals that Greenleaf sets for them. 
</P>
<P>
Her teen-age students observe all of this with bemusement. They know all of 
Greenleaf's methods and mottos by heart. 
</P>
<P>
"She has all these little tricks," says Cyndee Frazzetta, 20, of Silverado 
Canyon. Frazzetta has studied with Greenleaf since she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll tell me, 'If you do this trick five out of six times, you can have all 
the hot fudge sundaes you can eat.' Or, 'If you catch the baton five times in a 
row, you get a stuffed animal.' It will seem impossible. But I can't even tell 
you how many stuffed animals I have." 
</P>
<P>
She also has a lot of trophies. Frazzetta has won state, regional, national and 
world competitions. Three years ago, she twirled for students in Japan on a 
cultural exchange sponsored by the U.S. government, and early this year she 
twirled at the Miss Arizona contest, where she was fourth runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Although Greenleaf can be a demanding teacher, she says she does not want 
twirling to become an all-consuming pastime for her students. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a kid to give up being a kid," she says. "There should be a time 
for playing with jacks and climbing trees." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to competitions and seen some kids leave the floor crying," says 
Andy Carlson, 14, of Laguna Hills. Carlson has won state and regional 
competitions and placed ninth in the 1984 world meet. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of girls say, 'Oh, my coach will kill me if I don't do well.' We're not 
like that. Lou has no problem with anyone winning or losing. Her attitude is, 
'If you win, great. If you don't, we practice harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Greenleaf herself spent many hours as a child with baton in hand. The 
54-year-old Santa Ana native began twirling at age 9. 
</P>
<P>
"My father took me to a parade in Santa Ana and I saw a group of baton 
twirlers. I said to myself, 'You know, I bet I could twirl one of those.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had already shelled out money for fruitless piano lessons and dance 
lessons and refused to indulge in Greenleaf's new-found whim. Greenleaf 
fashioned her first baton out of a sawed-off broomstick and two tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, she enrolled in her first baton class, paying for the lessons by 
selling papers at a newsstand. At 10, she won the California state 
championship. By 14, she had garnered more than 600 trophies and had started 
teaching on her own for 25 cents a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Today she teaches through the Orange County and Saddleback Valley parks and 
recreation departments for $10 a lesson. She also gives private lessons at a 
park in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
During her four decades of teaching, twirling has changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be just a few basic twirls such as the figure eight, and 
everybody did the same thing," Greenleaf says. 
</P>
<P>
Twirlers have abandoned the military marches in favor of free-style dance 
routines to rock 'n' roll and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Marching music is passe," Greenleaf says. Instead, they twirl to the sounds of 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced students perform with batons that burn at both ends like tiki torches 
and machetes that look menacing when tossed into the air, even if their blades 
are dull. Some twirlers attach long ribbons to the end of their batons and wave 
them around the floor like magic wands. 
</P>
<P>
World-champion twirlers such as Frazzetta must be accomplished gymnasts. She 
will hurl the baton in the air and execute flips, cartwheels and flying camels 
before catching the baton with her hand or even her leg. She can spin the baton 
around her neck or bounce it high off her foot or her hip. 
</P>
<P>
"I love novelty," Greenleaf says. "I happen to be a very inventive teacher, and 
the more inventive you can be, the better your students can be." 
</P>
<P>
Greenleaf does not have the athletic form to perform these stunts herself, so 
she instructs by guiding the students through the more acrobatic moves. 
Sometimes she'll lift up their leg or pick them up bodily and turn them upside 
down to illustrate a trick. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Greenleaf's students twirl for their high school bands. Some get teased 
by classmates who don't understand the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the teasing hurts, but it usually goes in one ear and out the 
other," says Carlson, a student at Laguna Hills High School. "They can think 
what they want. Twirling has given me a lot of good friends and taught me to be 
a really good loser. 
</P>
<P>
"In twirling, you always drop the baton. I've learned to pick it up and just 
keep going." 
</P>
<P>
It's that kind of drive that Greenleaf hopes to foster in her twirlers. 
</P>
<P>
"These days children have TVs, VCRs and stereos to entertain themselves," she 
says. "You have to build their desire. The motivation should be to better 
ourselves. 
</P>

BRAILLE INSTITUTE'S STAFF LEADS STUDENTS TO A LIFE OF INDEPENDENCE

<P>
The garden is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that the people for whom the garden exists cannot see it. They are 
legally blind and are students at the Orange County Center of the Braille 
Institute in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But just because these students can't see the flowers doesn't mean that they 
can't observe their beauty. They can sense beauty that sighted people often 
can't perceive. 
</P>
<P>
The adolescents program at the Braille Institute is made possible by three 
groups of people: the students, the volunteers and the coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
"We rely heavily on our volunteers," said Steve Schuyler, the Braille 
Institute's youth coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 55 registered volunteers who help at activities and functions 
throughout the year. In addition, there are special groups of volunteers from 
various clubs who donate their time for special events, Schuyler said. 
</P>
<P>
During the school year, the program primarily focuses on independent living 
skills (ILS). These weekly classes help the blind students learn to accomplish 
the tasks necessary to become more independent. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ILS classes, we try to create a one-to-one ratio between volunteers and 
the students," Schuyler said. "And in it, the volunteers do the actual 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
In the ILS classes, students learn ways to help them identify paper money, such 
as folding different denominations in different ways. They also learn to cook 
their own meals and tie their own shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Tying shoelaces is so difficult because they (the blind) can't see where the 
ends are, and so it's hard for them to distinguish one end from the other," 
Schuyler said. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities during the year include rock climbing, ski and camping trips, 
and other outdoor events. 
</P>
<P>
"River-rafting down the Colorado River was the best trip we ever took. We ate 
really well and even though we didn't go in the rapids, it was really great," 
said Kellie Walders, a 16-year-old junior at Fountain Valley High School. 
Walders, who has been legally blind since birth, has been a student of the 
Braille Institute since she was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's sad that I'm not able to see everything," she said. "But 
the people treat me differently. Actually, I'm good at those things because I 
can laugh at it. If they saw themselves act the way they do (toward blind 
people), they'd probably be real embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people literally think that we cannot function as human beings. They 
think since we're blind that we're deaf, too. That's a real common 
misconception." 
</P>
<P>
Kellie explained that it is sometimes difficult to cope with stereotypes at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"With the sighted people in school, it's like no one can be different from 
anyone else," she said. "But with us (the blind students), it's OK to be 
different because we are different. I think that's good because we've learned 
to accept people as they are." 
</P>
<P>
Kellie hopes to someday become a novelist. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the institute's program for teen-agers includes daily, 
fun-oriented activities. They organize everything from roller-skating to trips 
to Wild Rivers water park; from scavenger hunts on Balboa to visiting a 
recording studio, and from windsurfing to tandem bike-riding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great watching the blind kids do things normal kids do and see them doing 
things you don't think they can do," said volunteer Brandon Marumoto, a 
17-year-old senior at La Quinta High School. "Roller-skating, for instance. How 
often do you see blind kids roller-skate? 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a blind person, instead of feeling sorry for them, you should 
respect them for all the things they can do." 
</P>
<P>
Mari Sanchez, blind since birth, has attended classes at the Braille Institute 
since she was 5. She is a 15-year-old sophomore at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
Mari, who can read material with very large print, said: "It's frustrating to 
go into a restaurant and not be able to read the menu and have to guess what 
they may have. I would love to read small writing without a magnifying glass." 
</P>
<P>
Schuyler said only a small percentage of the 152 students enrolled in the 
Braille program are totally blind. Most can see shadows, figures or even, as in 
the case of Mari, large print. Mari said: "I help people who are totally blind 
at Braille. Helping them makes you feel useful and needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty at Braille made me an independent person, and they taught me to 
speak for myself," said Mari, who sings for her school choir and hopes for a 
music career someday. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Erica Guerra, an 18-year-old sophomore at Stanford, said: "Ever since 
I saw Mary (a blind girl) on 'Little House on the Prairie,' I've wanted to work 
for Braille Institute. . . . If I couldn't see, I would be so helpless, but 
they (the students) make up for it in so many other ways. They're very 
independent." Guerra graduated from Connelly High School in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't assume they are helpless. The only limitations (blind people) have are 
the ones sighted people give them." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Weins, 16, has been legally blind since birth and has been in the Braille 
Institute's program since he was 7. The sophomore at Fountain Valley High 
School hopes to become a professional keyboard player someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I play music all by ear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuyler emphasized the importance of the program's volunteers. "If everyone in 
the country volunteered as much as our volunteers do, its significance would be 
hard to imagine," he said.

MARINES HALT ORGANIZED SEARCH FOR MISSING OBSERVATION PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Marine Corps on Thursday discontinued an organized search for an OV-10A 
Bronco observation plane and its two-man crew, which has been missing since 
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
But Marine officials pledged to continue an informal search during routine 
helicopter training flights, and added that volunteers from the Civil Air 
Patrol would continue searching throughout the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Marines will follow up on any reports. A hot-line number 
remains open to callers who may have sighted the aircraft between 11:30 a.m. 
and 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 24, the time when the plane was scheduled to fly. The 
number is (714) 726-2512. 
</P>
<P>
The OV-10A Bronco is described as a small, olive-green colored aircraft driven 
by two propeller engines. Its distinctive tail section consists of what would 
appear to be parallel fuselages which extend from each of the engine assemblies 
and are connected at the rudder by a horizontal stabilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The missing crew members are the pilot, Marine Capt. Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of 
Port Chester, N.Y., and the observer, Marine 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of 
Bismarck, N.D. An intensive search has been conducted for the men, with more 
than 150 aircraft canvassing the Southern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, based at Camp Pendleton, was on a reconnaissance training mission 
which could have covered an area from the base east toward the Colorado River, 
north toward Las Vegas and south to the Mexican border.

AFTER 44 YEARS, MYRIAD LANDINGS AND TAKEOFFS, MEADOWLARK AIRPORT CLOSES 
</P>

<P>
As they've done for years, fathers walked their children past scores of 
multicolored planes parked at Meadowlark Airport on Thursday. Dozens of people 
gathered at the the airport's cafe, waving at planes taking off into the clear 
sky overhead. 
</P>
<P>
And pilots swapped stories as they glanced over the beaten runway. 
</P>
<P>
All for the very last time. 
</P>
<P>
The barnstorming days came to an end Thursday when the Huntington Beach 
airport, the last privately run field in Orange and Los Angeles counties, shut 
down after 44 years of operation to make way for condominiums and a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
To those who knew Meadowlark, the airport was more than a place to land an 
airplane. It was a way of life that offered camaraderie, a freewheeling spirit 
and an escape from urban congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"Here there's still a touch of romanticism, a feeling of good-old-time pilots 
and airplanes," said flight instructor Benedict Rael. "This is a special place, 
and now it'll be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Generations of pilots have used the 65-acre airport, flying in and out in rapid 
succession without the help of a control tower. Hundreds of people, hooked by 
the appeal of taking to the sky, have taken flying lessons at Meadowlark. And 
some airport regulars have even called the airport home. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," said Ray Rice, a self-proclaimed airport bum known for his black 
leather flying cap, "I'm going to miss this place." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about noise and the danger of crashes, neighbors for years have 
lobbied to close the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Art and Dick Nerio, who have owned Meadowlark since 1952, finally decided to 
sell the land, which will be cleared for a 15-acre shopping center and a tract 
of about 350 homes. The Huntington Beach City Council approved the plans in 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's progress," said Jack Weidi, a mechanic at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots and residents alike on Thursday said the airport is a down-home place, 
one of the last fields around where people can walk on taxiways, touch the 
airplanes and chat with veteran pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to over 40 airports," Rice said. "There's nothing in the world like 
it. It's like stepping back in time." 
</P>
<P>
Regular visitors to Meadowlark, where pilots fill up at a self-serve gas pump 
and even help with airport repairs, said the field is an asset. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an end of an era not just for here, but for the whole county," said Susan 
Jesse, an 18-year resident near the airport who started taking flying lessons 
after coming to Meadowlark regularly. "It's the end of small-town charm. This 
is the last oasis. There is nothing left to develop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crying shame that it's happening. The airport is a novelty. It's a 
shame the city hasn't seen it as that." 
</P>
<P>
With the proposed development, there will be "more smog, more traffic, more 
cars," Jesse said, eating lunch amid revving airplane engines. "When we're out 
here at night, you see the stars and hear the crickets. It's so comforting." 
</P>
<P>
Pilots who keep their planes at Meadowlark, one of two Orange County airports 
exclusively for private pilots, moved their planes to other airports Thursday 
-- but not before fly-bys to salute an airport that has hosted biplanes, racing 
planes, specialized aircraft and a host of private craft flown by World War II 
veterans, commercial pilots and beginners. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny airstrip at the corner of Warner Avenue and Bolsa Chica Street has 
always been unique, enthusiasts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Name one other airport in the country where you can sit within 50 feet of the 
runway, walk on and kick the tires," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Flight instructor Carl Roseman, who has taught there for 10 years, said 
Meadowlark has a carefree atmosphere that few airports can match. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a folksy airport," he said as his plane was being serviced. "This is a 
very, very sad day." 
</P>
<P>
Said pilot Dave Payne: "The bottom line is we'll really miss this place." 
</P>
<P>
Art Nerio, who has managed the airport since 1974, said he felt ambiguous about 
giving up his job, which included collecting $3 landing fees on his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
"When you leave something, you have mixed reaction," he said. "I'm happy there 
will be something new, but I will miss the people." 
</P>
<P>
About 33 people will lose their jobs when the airport shuts down, Nerio said, 
adding that construction on the property is scheduled to begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots said they will remember Meadowlark for its challenging landings. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,200-foot runway -- just 35 feet wide and cluttered with weeds -- is short 
by aviation standards. The approach is tricky, as planes skim nearby homes and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can fly out of Meadowlark, you can fly out of anywhere," said Jack 
Humber, a pilot from Long Beach who flew Lancaster bombers for the Royal 
Canadian Air Force during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stevens, 57, of Westminster took his Cessna 182 on a short hop, circling 
the single-engine plane around the airport for one of the last times. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks awful small the first time you land," Stevens said of the runway as 
he scanned the skies in preparation for landing. "You do not want to screw up." 
</P>
<P>
Meadowlark enthusiasts attended a barbecue Thursday night to commemorate the 
end of Meadowlark. Some even took souvenirs to remind them of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
But many had enough memories to carry them through. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was 2 years old, Eric Trowbridge, now 24, had come to the airport to 
watch planes. Later, he washed planes to earn money for flight school. He got 
his pilot's license when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss a lot of my friends," he said as he surveyed the taxiway. "I 
did a lot of growing up here." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that the airport has had its fair share of accidents, including an 
emergency landing in January when a restored 1941 biplane crashed nose-first 
into a fence just north of the runway, the airport's neighbors had mixed 
reactions over the closure. 
</P>
<P>
H.J. Smith, who lives under the flight path, said the January crash came within 
feet of his home of 12 years. The airport, he said, has been a constant source 
of noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the pilots, but it has been very annoying," he said. "I'm 
glad to see it go." 
</P>
<P>
For others, the novelty hasn't worn off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm heartbroken it's gone, I mean it," said Jeanne McGregor, who has lived 
under the landing path for two years. "I guess nothing is sacred anymore."

CLOSURE PUTS BANNER-TOWING SKY AD FIRM INTO A TAILSPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The closure of Meadowlark Airport, on the eve of one of summer's biggest beach 
weekends, could spell the end of the Sky Ad Co., the only Orange County-based 
firm that flies promotional banners over crowded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Ad has been pulling banners advertising everything from weight-loss clinics 
to frozen yogurt above the beaches for the past 20 summers, and had hoped to do 
the same this weekend. But the closing of Meadowlark and legal problems with 
the Federal Aviation Administration have jeopardized the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the word gets out that you can't tow the banners across all the 
coastline and your business is wiped out," company attorney Scott Raphael said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say they plan, under an agreement with owners of the 
Huntington Beach airport and the FAA, to swoop over the airfield this weekend 
and, without touching down, pick up their banners while taking off and landing 
at Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city of Huntington Beach says that the airport's owners would be 
breaching an agreement that they have with the city and the developers of a 
retail complex planned for a portion of the site. In addition, the airport 
owners, Dick and Art Nerio, plan to build a condominium complex on the site, 
although plans for the development haven't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The contract calls for no more flights as of today. Art Folger, deputy city 
attorney, said that even picking up the banners without landing and taking off 
would be a normal airport activity. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do that, then I think they will be in breach of the agreement," Folger 
said. "That's an airport function." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Sky Ad Co., along with an association of private pilots and 
homeowners, attempted to obtain a temporary restraining order to keep the 
airport open until construction on the projects begin, but a judge denied the 
motion. Sky Ad has about $20,000 worth of business at stake this weekend, 
according to Raphael, the attorney for company owner Bob Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a last-ditch effort to salvage what he can," Raphael said. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Sky Ad plans not only to fly banners but also to display a 
Day-Glo color promotion by KNX Radio requiring them to fly four planes in 
formation. They are also scheduled to fly the Coors Light Silver Bullet beer 
can, perhaps their most recognizeable promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The planes can't take off with the banners because of their weight. So to pick 
up them up, the single-engine planes must swoop down at near-stall speed, 
allowing hooks attached to the planes to catch cables tied to the banners. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon, the owner of the company since 1977, said that the plan was to pick up 
the banners at Meadowlark only this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to perform the pickup operation this week at Long Beach 
Airport because of heavy air traffic there, Tanya Reis, a company official, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have one little thing that goes wrong and that throws them off," she said. 
"It's ideally situated here at (Meadowlark). It was just a perfect setup for 
our business" 
</P>

Sky Ad, with five single-engine planes, is among the largest of about 10 
banner-towing companies in Southern California, Cannon said. The firms are most 
active during summer weekends, when they advertise, among other things, 
concerts, new movies, restaurants, running shoes and suntan lotion. 
Personalized banners, such as marriage proposals, also are common. 
</P>
<P>
But several coastal cities have complained about the planes on grounds of 
noise, view obstruction and safety. Newport Beach earlier this summer 
considered taking action but found that regulating such flights was within the 
FAA's jurisdiction, City Manager Robert L. Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of Meadowlark appears to be just one more setback faced by Sky Ad 
in the past two years. In 1987, the FAA banned such companies from flying at 
low levels along the shore near Los Angeles International Airport. The planes, 
Cannon said, had flown at about 150 to 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The ban forced the planes to instead fly at 4,500 feet, out of the view of 
beachgoers, Cannon said, adding that the light planes, carrying the heavy 
banners, were unable to gain that much altitude. The result was a loss of 
business, because 75% of the company's clients wished to have their products 
advertised up and down the coast from Malibu to Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Ad's business, according to Cannon, hasn't fully returned to what it was 
before 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco invalidated 
the ban, but Sky Ad still was required to obtain permission to fly near the Los 
Angeles airport. Cannon said that since the court struck down the ban, the 
company has been denied permission to fly through that airspace 11 out of 12 
times. Before 1987, permission was rarely denied, he said.

STEROIDS SOLD LIKE 'VITAMINS,' U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

An El Toro marine sergeant and his wife, accused of smuggling and selling 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal steroids, ran an operation much 
like a "health food store," advertising the drugs in leaflets as though they 
were expensive "vitamins," federal officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Matthew J. Sigloch, 37, and Rene M. Sigloch, who were indicted 
Wednesday on federal charges of conspiracy and distribution of "counterfeit" 
steroids, allegedly sold the illegal substances from his office at the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station and stored them at their home on the military base, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunnery sergeant displayed business savvy by selling the steroids, a 
chemical derivative of the male sex hormone testosterone, much like vitamins, 
Fitzpatrick said. Federal officials declined to indicate who Sigloch's 
customers were. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked for Cash 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San 
Diego, Sigloch handed his customers a typed sheet, listing what steroids he was 
able to offer and at what price. He also asked customers for cash instead of 
checks because the money was harder to trace, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Sigloch) would pull out a list and (tell) the agents what kind of 
possibilities he can offer to them," Fitzpatrick said. "He ran it much like a 
health food store. He had leaflets listing what kind of steroids he sold, much 
like the way stores sell vitamins." 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Sigloch and his wife were arrested on Aug. 2 by 
U.S. Customs Service agents in Orange County after a lengthy undercover 
investigation. As early as Aug. 9, 1988, the couple began smuggling illegal 
steroids from Mexico for sale on the black market, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Sigloch concentrated on selling "counterfeit" steroids. Such steroids still are 
chemical derivatives of testosterone, but they are not manufactured by U.S. 
drug companies and subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration controls, and 
are instead produced in Mexico, where controls are considered lax. They are 
packed in bottles with labels falsely representing that they are made in the 
United States, then smuggled across the border, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids, which can cause damage to the liver, are illegal for use in 
the United States without a doctor's prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Sigloch, who has been stationed at the El Toro base since March, 1988, and has 
been on active duty in the corps since 1972, is continuing to perform his 
duties as a helicopter hydraulic mechanic in charge of maintaining Sea Knight 
helicopters, Marine Corps officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Sigloch is employed at the base at the housing department, according to 
the indictment. The couple continues to live in housing at the air station, 
military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that the military is immediately considering removing 
Sigloch from his duties. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough information to make that determination," said Sgt. Anne 
Larson, an air station spokeswoman. She said that base officials will determine 
further action when they get more information on the case from federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs Special Agent Larry Fowler said it does not appear that Sigloch 
sold his steroids to fellow Marines, although he did make most of his 
transactions out of his office and at the couple's home. Fowler said the 
investigation of Sigloch and his wife began when customs agents were given a 
tip about steroids being smuggled across the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said Sigloch had customers, buyers and dealers, and partners who helped 
smuggle the steroids across state lines. He apparently relayed his customer's 
orders on his office telephone, which is paid for by the military. 
</P>
<P>
"As a further part of the conspiracy, defendant Matthew J. Sigloch abused his 
position of trust as a member of the United States Marine Corps to accept, 
verify, and place orders on a secured telephone at the Marine Corps Air Station 
in El Toro," the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
For some of his out-of-state orders and deliveries, Sigloch often used U.S. 
Postal Service's overnight Express Mail. One of his biggest mistakes was to 
sell his wares to undercover customs agents posing as customers, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his sales in March, Sigloch sold $5,000 worth of steroids as well as 
a $20 pack of needles to inject the chemicals to a customs agent in a motel 
room in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The Siglochs, who were released on bond after their arrest, are scheduled to be 
arraigned Wednesday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
They each face a maximum of five years in federal prison for conspiracy, as 
well as a maximum of three years each on three counts of distribution, plus 
fines totaling $250,000 per count, Fitzpatrick said.

NEW LIFE FOR LA PLAZA;

<P>
LANDSCAPING, STREET WIDENING GIVE NEW VITALITY TO DANA POINT STREET 
</P>

Edie Ryan paused at her car on Thursday afternoon and surveyed the 
almost-completed new park in downtown Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here in Dana Point for 23 years," she said. "La Plaza didn't look 
so good in the past. Now it has more personality." 
</P>
<P>
A $500,000 renovation of La Plaza in Dana Point has transformed the one-block 
street from a clogged eyesore to a restful, scenic-walking and shopping area, 
city officials say. The new landscaped park, street and shops around it now 
form a core area for the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'll have when this is completed is as close to an old-fashioned town 
square as you're going to be able to find," Councilman Mike Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Elaine Krause added: "There used to be an ugly old parking median running 
down the street. It was just a regular street, and a confusing one, because 
two-way traffic ran down both sides. Now it's becoming like a little park, and 
the traffic will be safer." 
</P>
<P>
The block, north of Coast Highway near its intersection with Street of the 
Golden Lantern, is scheduled to be dedicated on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Workmen are putting finishing touches on the transformation of La Plaza. The 
once-narrow concrete street median has been expanded into a wide, graceful 
greensward. An arbor and recessed seating area flank one end of the mini-park. 
Curved benches and palm trees anchor the other end. Trees, grass and flowers 
surround a curving walkway down the center. 
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the street, old and new buildings reflect the diverse 
character of the old seacoast community. New buildings, including the 
distinctive Clock Tower Building at the north end of La Plaza, are built in the 
traditional Cape Code architecture of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
The center park, or commons, has an array of newly planted trees and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me they're really elated at how this is turning out," said Champ 
Vukoty, superintendent for the construction project. He noted that in contrast 
to the expanse of green now dominating the center of La Plaza, only a few 
bushes formerly grew on the once-narrow street median. 
</P>
<P>
Antique metallic lanterns, once used as street markers in the old community of 
Dana Point, are being refurbished and will hang in the commons area. The old 
lanterns, many of which had colored glass to reflect various hues, led to the 
names of many Dana Point streets, such as Street of the Blue Lantern. 
</P>
<P>
According to community archives, Dana Point always hoped that La Plaza would 
one day be "the commercial and social core of the community -- a gathering 
place as well as a retail center for the day-to-day needs of residents and 
visitors." 
</P>
<P>
With a federal community development grant and some private donations, the new 
city of Dana Point was able to bring the long dream of a "town square" into 
reality, Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're doing here is totally different from the ultra-modern, 
impersonal, sleek malls," he said. "This is a place for people to come 
together. We may never have the old pot-bellied-stove-in-the-barbershop type of 
square, but this is pretty close." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said La Plaza Commons will be used for some civic ceremonies, 
band concerts and celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mayor Krause: "It's a great improvement for the city, and I think people 
are going to enjoy using it and seeing it."

THE GOOD OL' SUMMERTIME IS GONE, SO FAR AS EASIER COMMUTING GOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many Orange County residents look to summer as that balmy spell just made for 
lounging in the sun. Leslie Runzler is no different, but she savors the season 
for an additional reason. It's the perfect time to drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
"August is an especially great month," said Runzler, who commutes from Dana 
Point to her job in Irvine at Fluor Corp. "Everyone vacations in August, I 
guess. I can just zoom through the lights and I'm on my way. It's just 
wonderful. It's like traffic you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's summertime and the driving is easy. But you won't have much longer to 
enjoy it. The summer slack typically disappears after the upcoming Labor Day 
weekend, transportation experts say. 
</P>
<P>
What better time, then, to gaze back to those happy summer days on the nearly 
gridlock-free highways and byways of Orange County. All across the Southland, 
cars packed onto the interstates and arterials during the grueling rush-hour 
move along noticeably faster during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Transportation have the numbers to prove 
it. Orange County commuters could typically drive a congested 11-mile stretch 
of the Costa Mesa Freeway though the county's midsection in 28 minutes last 
spring. The same trip took 20 minutes in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a couple of things happening," said Keith Gilbert, highway 
engineering manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California. "There's a 
lot less traffic because school's out. And with the kids at home, many people 
take their vacation during the summer, eliminating even more drivers than 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, freeway veterans contend that they experience improved commute speeds 
almost every morning and evening of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is a lot lighter in the summer," said Val Denise, a supervisor at an 
Anaheim Hills travel agency who drives 35 miles down California 91 each morning 
from her home in the Los Angeles County community of Hawthorne. "I notice it 
particularly at the interchange where the I-5 and the 91 intersect. When school 
is in session, every day is a nightmare there. When school's out, there's only 
maybe a couple bad days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Experts echo those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer is a relief. The freeways operate a lot better," said Joe El-Harake, 
Orange County commuter lanes coordinator for Caltrans. "Unfortunately, it's not 
that way the rest of the year. I compare it to the Three Stooges when all three 
try to get through the door at the same time and get stuck. It's the same thing 
on the freeway most of the year. Everyone jams in at once and the freeway 
breaks down." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's South County office said 
he can practically judge the change in seasons by the shifts in traffic. One 
day the freeway is clogged, with cars backed up on the off-ramps. The next 
workday, traffic is remarkably thinned out, all because school has shut down 
for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get out there on my way in to work and see the traffic is light and 
wonder what's going on," Daily said. "Then it'll dawn on me: 'Oh yeah, today's 
the start of summer vacation.' It's a noticeable difference." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Thornton, an on-air anchor with Metro Traffic Control, which provides 
periodic commuter reports for more than 30 radio stations throughout the 
Southland, agreed that freeway congestion eases in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it slackens off when the kids are out of school, and it gets heavier 
again right after Labor Day," said Thornton, who ended a yearlong stint in a 
helicopter in 1987 and now works out of a studio. "But it's not a huge 
difference, because there's always traffic around here. The freeway has its own 
temperament. Some days it flows; some days it stops dead." 
</P>
<P>
Denise, meanwhile, theorizes that another factor improves commuting conditions 
during summer: more hours of daylight. "When the time changes and it gets dark 
on the freeway, people slow down," she said. "It just takes more time, 
especially when it first changes and they start needing their headlights." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the smoother commute occurs during a season when Orange County's 
freeways handle more cars than any other time of the year, Caltrans officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Herds of tourists jamming the county help boost daily traffic loads higher than 
during the other nine months. Fortunately, all those out-of-town visitors 
typically steer clear of the freeways during peak morning and afternoon 
commuting hours. 
</P>
<P>
With tourists and commuters alike spread relatively evenly through the day, the 
rush hour becomes more lamb, less lion. 
</P>
<P>
But before you cancel that late summer vacation in favor of a few minutes saved 
on the trip to work, take heed. Transportation experts are quick to voice 
several important caveats about summer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
While rush-hour speeds typically rise, traffic during lunchtime and weekends 
tends to be heavier as tourists and residents hit the pavement, they say. 
Motorists returning from the beach on a sunny day can make the afternoon 
commute a grind. Moreover, a smooth rush-hour can be ruined just as easily in 
summer by a seemingly insignificant event like a stalled car or a minor 
fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
Most days, however, traffic moves faster during commuting hours. That 
improvement occurs chiefly because schools shut down for the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the South County, a large percentage of the high school students with 
driver's licenses head each day to campus alone in a car, the CHP's Daily said. 
"This is an affluent area we have down here and most of the kids have cars," he 
said. "I think it's probably the same way at the local colleges." 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, where classes resumed this week, the school-year 
enrollment of more than 25,000 students shrinks to about 5,400 in the summer, 
according to Judy Mandel, a university spokeswoman. With only 400 dorm rooms, 
most everyone drives to campus, squeezing into the nearly 9,000 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Other college campuses have a similar impact on the county's road network. A 
quarter of the 16,000 students at UC Irvine live on campus, with the rest 
driving in to attend classes. When school is in session, the university adds 
about 43,000 vehicle trips each day to local roads and freeways, said Richard 
Demerjian, a senior planner with the school. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the 26,000 students at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa commute 
from homes far outside the nine cities that form the school's district 
boundaries. With a quarter of the college's classes meeting before 10 a.m., 
many of those students are on the road at peak morning traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Bartholomew knows firsthand what hordes of college commuters can mean. 
For nine years she has traversed the streets around Cal State Fullerton on the 
way from her home in Yorba Linda to work as manager of a bank near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I have two paths I travel -- one is for summer, one is for when school 
starts," said Bartholomew, who commutes entirely on surface streets. "The first 
week when everyone's trying to get situated and into classes, it's 
unbelievable. The freeway is stopped up at the off-ramps. But then it settles 
down and you get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Some transportation experts say summer isn't the motoring utopia it once was. 
With housing construction booming in Orange County, they've noticed less of a 
decline in congestion compared to summers past. 
</P>
<P>
"The line between summer and the rest of the year is becoming blurred," said 
Steve Hogan, the county's transportation program manager. "There's just so much 
traffic trying to get from point A to point B; even if you drop parts of it out 
of the system, it doesn't solve the congestion problem. You still have 
congestion." 
</P>
<P>
Many motorists, however, say it only takes a few weeks of sitting in heavy 
September congestion to make them yearn for those days of summer on the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Nelson, a public information officer at UC Irvine, isn't exactly counting 
the days left, but admits he'll probably miss the 10 or 20 minutes he saves on 
each leg of his 25-mile commute from home in San Clemente to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the summer, it's to the point now that traffic is so bad, you don't 
consider it a break, just a brief respite," Nelson said. "But I imagine that, 
come September when all the schools start up, I'll say, 'God, wasn't it nice in 
the summer.' And it really wasn't that nice."

SALES TAX SUPPORTERS WANT BALLOT STATEMENT REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of the half-cent countywide sales tax for transportation projects 
will seek a court order today directing county election officials to remove 
what they contend is a false statement from the ballot argument against the 
measure, campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted by supporters is a claim that approval of the sales tax will lead to 
"massive indebtedness" of "$18 billion plus interest." Written arguments from 
both sides of the sales tax debate will be included in the official ballot 
pamphlet sent to all registered voters in Orange County before the Nov. 7 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read the opposition's ballot statement I knew it was wrong and I didn't 
want it to be allowed and have the voters confused by their inaccuracies," said 
Costa Mesa attorney Dana W. Reed, treasurer of Citizens for Yes on M, the group 
supporting the sales tax. Reed is also a member of the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, which wrote Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Measure M itself refers to $900 million a year, for 20 years, and 
that adds up to $18 billion," said Sandra L. Genis, a Costa Mesa councilwoman 
and slow-growth activist who signed the ballot statement opposing the sales 
tax. "It seems like this would come under free speech. There is no independent 
ballot analysis yet, so whose interpretation are you basing anything on? It 
seems ridiculous to go to the expense of a court hearing." 
</P>
<P>
The half-cent sales tax would raise $3.1 billion for highway and transit 
projects over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters contended Thursday that Measure M does not allow borrowing of up to 
$900 million a year for 20 years, as claimed by opponents but does contain a 
$900 million a year ceiling on total transportation agency expenditures because 
of the so-called Gann spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Measure M said they were upset because they may be assessed 
attorney's fees if they lose in court today. 
</P>
<P>
Genis was angry, however, when told that the proponents' lawyers had said it 
was legally impossible to withdraw the $18-billion debt claim from the ballot 
statement without a court order. So was San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice, who 
also signed the ballot argument being challenged by Reed. "I was told that I 
may be liable for $10,000 in attorney's fees," Rice said. "I'm not happy about 
it."

After increasing for three consecutive years, charitable giving by Southern 
California companies fell slightly in 1988, reflecting a national trend that 
poses a major fund-raising challenge for charities already coping with 
government cuts in social spending and federal laws that reduce the tax 
advantages of some donations. 
</P>
<P>
Total giving by 108 of the area's largest corporations and private foundations 
dropped to $263.1 million from $266.8 million in 1987, according to an 
executive summary of a report to be released later this month by the Southern 
California Assn. of Philanthropy. Both total giving and the percent of money 
given to Southern California organizations decreased for the first time since 
the survey began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"When one is running a nonprofit organization -- whether dealing with the 
problems of the homeless or drug abuse -- this is not good news," said Lon M. 
Burns, president of the philanthropy association. "Corporate philanthropy is 
one of the major sources of financial support for charitable groups. That 
support is shrinking and that should be of some concern." 
</P>
<P>
At least nine members of the philanthropy association are in Orange County. And 
two of those corporate members contacted Thursday said they are bucking the 
trend and are giving more to charity in this year, not less. 
</P>
<P>
The Fieldstone Co., major Southern California home builders based in Newport 
Beach, said it is giving more than $1 million to charity this year, a 20% 
increase from last year, while Carl Karcher Enterprises, owner of the Carl's 
Jr. restaurant chain, is donating about $640,000. A Karcher representative said 
the figure was an increase over last year, but did not say by how much, adding 
that the company routinely sets aside 2% of its pretax earnings to charity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
70 Mergers Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, business enterprises, including foundations created by 
corporations, donated $4.7 billion in 1988. That is a 3.2% rise over 1987 but, 
after adjusting figures to account for inflation, corporate giving showed no 
growth, according to a study released last month by the American Assn. of 
Fundraising Counsel, a New York-based organization that tracks philanthropic 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in corporate giving, experts say, stems from the wave of corporate 
mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts sweeping the country, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In California last year, there were 78 mergers or acquisitions valued at $10 
million or more, according to W.T. Grimm &amp; Co., a research group in 
Schaumburg, Ill. Nationally, there were a record 369 mergers in 1988 valued at 
more than $100 million -- a 22% increase over the 301 mergers in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"When two companies merge, it is often followed by layoffs and a decline in 
matching gift programs" with employees, said Nathan Weber, a vice president 
with the American Assn. of Fundraising Counsel. What's more, Weber added, 
acquired "companies also become heavily indebted and often don't have (the 
resources) to keep operating two separate" charitable foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Although nearly a dozen of the 108 California companies and foundations that 
were surveyed have been involved in a major acquisition or merger since 1985, 
none of six companies reached by The Times said they had reduced the level of 
charitable giving after such transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our merger with Crocker Bank hasn't affected our level of giving at all," said 
Ron E. Eadie, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation, whose parent company, 
Wells Fargo Bank, acquired Crocker National Bank in 1986 for $1.07 billion. "In 
fact, we've increased our giving from $4.6 million in 1986 to $6.4 million in 
1988," Eadie said. 
</P>
<P>
But in some cases, mergers can have a dramatic effect on giving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Changes a Factor 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, for example, three corporate foundations were eliminated after 
Commercial Credit Corp. acquired Primerica Corp. in December, 1988, and renamed 
itself Primerica. 
</P>
<P>
The diversified New York-based financial services group, which operates a 
number of units in California, including offices of its Smith Barney, Harris 
Upham &amp; Co. investment house subsidiary, eliminated about $3 million in 
annual donations provided by the Smith Barney, Primerica and Commercial Credit 
foundations, according to Dee Topol, the recently hired chairman of the 
Primerica Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Topol said in 1990 the foundations will be consolidated and will resume making 
donations based on a percentage of Primerica's corporate income. But she said 
the amount of money, initially, will probably not exceed $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Besides mergers, experts also expect the 1986 Tax Reform Act to have some 
impact on giving. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms discouraged some philanthropic contributions by eliminating 
charitable deductions for taxpayers who do not itemize. The law also reduced 
the tax advantage, for business and individuals alike, of donating property 
that has appreciated in value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Haven't Felt It 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with the nation in the midst of a seven-year-long economic 
expansion and the California economy especially strong, many experts are 
surprised that corporate giving would be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat surprised," said Amy Damianakes, spokeswoman for the Pacific 
Telesis Foundation. She added that it is important for businesses to be 
generous in good economic times because when "business is having a hard time, 
no doubt the communities will be too and that's the last time we want to turn 
our back on community needs." 
</P>
<P>
So far, many charitable groups and organizations -- including the United Way of 
Los Angeles, which got two-thirds of its $83.5 million in donations last year 
from worker payroll deductions -- say they have yet to feel the impact of the 
drop in corporate giving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education Attracts Funding 
</P>
<P>
But Alan H. Woo, president of the Asian Pacific Community Fund of Southern 
California, said if the trend persists, it will increase competition for funds 
among charities and affect the operation of many service groups. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen is that . . . those organizations with the best boards 
and the most famous celebrities will get all the money and raising funds will 
become harder, especially for those of us in the ethnic community," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
The six-page executive summary of corporate philanthropy in Southern California 
found that members who gave more than $10 million are, for the first time, 
accounting for a smaller share of total giving. 
</P>
<P>
Just five donors gave $10 million or more in 1988, accounting for 37.6% of 
charitable contributions in 1988, the survey found. More than half of all 
donations were in amounts ranging from $1 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among all donors surveyed, education continues to be the most popular category, 
accounting for 36.8% of expenditures. That was followed by social services 
(21.8%); arts and humanities (17.4%), and health and hospitals (14.6%).

RISING TIDE OF FOREIGN PATENTS STIRS DEBATE ABOUT U.S. COMPETITIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL S. KAPLAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Tsinberg's workroom at Philips Laboratories near Ossining, N.Y., brims 
with the gear of the modern inventor: Television monitors tuned to test 
patterns stand on shelves, stacks of electronic equipment blink silently in 
corners, and bench drawers display labels for mysterious gizmos such as "logic 
analyzer probes parts." 
</P>
<P>
It's a playground for the Soviet-born engineer, who in the past six years has 
won four U.S. patents in high-definition television under the aegis of 
Dutch-owned North American Philips Corp. But it's also a vantage point from 
which he surveys U.S. technology. And these days, Tsinberg is starting to worry 
that the invention prowess of his adopted country is weakening. 
</P>
<P>
He sees signs everywhere -- from what he terms the "lousy" science and math 
education in this country to the closing of major research laboratories owing 
to corporate restructurings. He notes, too, that European- and Asian-born 
scientists are the majority at research labs where he has worked in the United 
States and that increasing numbers of U.S. patents are granted to Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sputnik was launched, it captured headlines" and prompted a rapid U.S. 
response, the inventor said. "But with this slow decay process, there's nothing 
to put in headlines. It's hard to notice and very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just One Voice 
</P>
<P>
Tsinberg's is just one voice in a growing debate about America's technological 
competitiveness. Some analysts say America's technology engine is sputtering 
while the engines of Japan, Korea and Western Europe are at full tilt. If 
current trends continue, analysts say, the nation will experience a technology 
deficit that could lead to more anemic manufacturing in certain industries and, 
ultimately, a decreased standard of living. America's loss of dominance in 
consumer electronics and automobiles is the point of the wedge, the experts 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Others say America is not lagging, that the country is pre-eminent in several 
cutting-edge fields such as biotechnology and computers. Rather, the world is 
simply catching up -- a positive development. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the debate are statistics compiled by the federal Patent and 
Trademark Office in Arlington, Va. An increasing number of U.S. patents are 
being awarded to foreign residents and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, of the 77,925 patents issued (excluding grants for plants and 
designs), 48% were awarded to nonresidents. Japan received the most (16,158, or 
21%), followed by West Germany (9%), the United Kingdom and France (3% each). 
</P>
<P>
This invention snapshot contrasts sharply with the picture 25 years before, 
when 18.6% of U.S. patents were awarded to foreigners. Patent grants to 
foreigners will reach the 50% mark "within the next few years," predicts 
Herbert Wamsley, executive director of Intellectual Property Owners, a 
Washington trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the percentage of U.S. patents to foreigners rising, but the number 
of patents granted to U.S. businesses and individuals is generally declining -- 
though there's been an uptick since 1982. Last year for example, 40,497 U.S. 
patents for mechanical, chemical or electrical applications were granted to 
U.S. residents. Fifteen years ago there were 51,504. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Japanese companies have been particularly active in targeting 
-- and winning -- patents in such areas as consumer electronics, automotive and 
photo optics. In the category of internal combustion engines, for example, 
Japanese companies won 44% of all U.S. patents issued in 1987, while U.S. 
companies received 30%. Ten years earlier, the shares were the exact reverse. 
</P>
<P>
A company routinely seeks patents in countries where it sells its products to 
keep others from making, using or selling the invention. 
</P>
<P>
Although the patent stats are in black and white, opposing sides of the 
"Is-American-inventiveness-slipping?" debate draw conclusions of different 
shades. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who see little cause for alarm is Richard Nelson, Henry Luce 
professor of International Political Economy at Columbia University. For one 
thing, he notes, Japanese companies traditionally apply for more patents per 
innovation -- and receive them -- than do U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Anomaly 
</P>
<P>
Nelson also believes that the figures show the correction of a historical 
anomaly -- the U.S. pre-eminence in technology and manufacturing after World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Shattered by the war, it took Japan and Europe more than 15 years to catch up 
to the United States in trading and industrial output. What we are witnessing, 
Nelson said, is the rapid industrialization of Japan and Europe relative to 
America, coupled with the globalization of the world's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, he said, are applying for more and more patents in the 
United States because they sell more and more products here. The amount of 
inventing in Japan is also going up, relative to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose (these developments) bother our sensitivities quite a bit. But the 
sense of lost leadership . . . doesn't bother me," Nelson said. "Why should it? 
It makes for a more complex and balanced world for us to live in, not one 
that's necessarily detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing Nelson's view is Edwin Mansfield, director of the Center for Economics 
and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania. "I think it's true that the 
U.S. is not as dominant as it was before . . . but there are advantages to 
having a strong competitive Germany and a strong Japan. So I think it isn't as 
worrisome as some make out."

CANOLA BECOMES VIABLE ALTERNATIVE CROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
NASHVILLE, Tenn.

<P>
Canola may become an economic lifesaver for farmers in the South and Midwest as 
the low-fat cooking oil squeezed from the plant's seeds becomes more popular 
with health-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than other popular cooking oils, including 
coconut, soybean and corn oils, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Saturated fat has been linked to cholesterol, a substance that can contribute 
to clogged arteries and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will be a viable crop for the mid-South and at yields that will be 
successful for economic returns," said John F. Bradley, superintendent of the 
University of Tennessee Agriculture Experiment Station at Milan. "It will give 
our farmers in this area an alternative crop. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying it's going to be the salvation of the farmer but it is real 
promising," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canola is a trademark for a variety of rapeseed, from which the oil is 
squeezed. 
</P>
<P>
Canada and Europe are the largest producers of canola. Before 1985, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration listed the seed's oil as toxic to humans and 
banned its growth. But genetic engineering produced an edible variety and the 
FDA removed the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"This released us from having to import from Canada and Europe," Bradley said. 
"We have found that it can be grown in the mid-South and the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, only about 70,000 acres are grown in the United States. U.S. 
Department of Agriculture statistics show 440 million pounds of canola oil were 
imported this year. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say canola's seed production is high and that on a profit basis it 
outperforms soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky and Illinois are the chief producers of canola in the United States. 
Kentucky growers planted about 2,000 acres of canola in 1987, then 8,000 acres 
as it caught on in 1988, according to a study by the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan so far have only dabbled in 
the crop. But Bradley believes that during the next five years canola will 
become commonplace throughout the mid-South. 
</P>
<P>
Canola has become more popular with consumers recently as health concerns have 
arisen over the use of tropical oils, found to be high in saturated fats. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will see probably more people going over to canola oil as their 
cooking oil," said Wayne Flinchum, professor of plant and soil science at the 
University of Tennessee Agriculture Extension Service in Jackson.

PLAYTIME AT THE DOLL HUT; 
</P>
<P>
TINY ANAHEIM ROCK 'N' ROLL BAR TO STAGE FINAL FLING FOR THE PONTIAC BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Playing for free, now we got some fans tonight -- down at the Doll Hut. -- from 
"Doll Hut," the Pontiac Brothers 
</P>
<P>
John Mello's dream was to open a little pub, a rock 'n' roll hangout where 
musicians like himself could drop in during their off hours, have a beer and 
establish some out-of-the-spotlight camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
A singer and record producer based in Anaheim, Mello spent two years planning a 
move into the bar business with his wife, Linda. Their search ended a few 
months ago when the Mellos called to answer an ad for a place that had gone up 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The broker," Mello recalls, "said, 'It's called the Doll Hut' " -- and Mello 
immediately said he'd buy it. "I didn't even need to know the price," he 
recalled last weekend, sitting at the bar. "I already knew everything I needed 
to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out he'd done some drinking at the tiny wooden barroom on Anaheim's South 
Adams Street, so he knew it met the funkiness quotient that he was looking for. 
On the outside, it was a red-painted, weather-worn, one-room cabin, a 
50-year-old building that really was almost doll-size. On the inside it was a 
functional, unadorned pub where the chief attractions were cheap drinks and 
darts. 
</P>
<P>
No ferns, no decorating scheme, no trendiness. The total antithesis of Orange 
County mall culture. Best of all, Mello knew that the Doll Hut came with its 
own little slice of rock 'n' roll lore: The Pontiac Brothers, one of the more 
honest and unpretentiously rambunctious alternative rock bands of the 1980s, 
had honored the place by naming an album after it, and plastering a close-up 
picture of the Doll Hut's blue neon sign on the album's back cover. 
</P>
<P>
The band broke up last year, having released three critically praised but 
commercially under-appreciated albums that combined the raw, basic crunch rock 
of the Rolling Stones with the emotional immediacy of the Replacements. The 
Pontiac Brothers will get together Saturday night for one last fling, playing 
for free -- down at the Doll Hut. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion will be a farewell-to-Orange County show for the Pontiacs' 
guitarist, Ward Dotson, who will move to New York City in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson said he used to pass the Doll Hut on his way to work, and decided to 
drop in one day when he saw a sign advertising a "60 lunch." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beer, a hot dog and a bag of chips," he recalls. The Doll Hut became 
a regular watering hole for the Pontiac Brothers, even though the other 
regulars were hardly a rock 'n' roll crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to practice about two miles from there, and afterward we'd get a few 
drinks and plan band strategy," Dotson said. "We'd walk in there and double the 
occupancy. I never saw more than 10 people there until after (Mello) bought 
it." Dotson said that the band "never, ever" saw any other rock musicians 
hanging out there. "There would be guys from the train yard nearby. We used to 
see this guy down there that just got out of the pen. We'd listen to him ramble 
on forever." 
</P>
<P>
When the Pontiacs put out their first album for an American label in 1985, they 
called it "Doll Hut" and put on a free show at the bar to celebrate the 
record's release. The album didn't feature a song called "Doll Hut," however -- 
an oversight that the Pontiac Brothers corrected on their next album in a tune 
that mentioned some of the regulars by name. The song's release gave the band 
another excuse for a free show at the Doll Hut. 
</P>
<P>
"After the album came out, they'd give us free stuff all the time," Dotson 
said. "They thought we were Van Halen or something." 
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 1, the Doll Hut has been run by the Mellos, who are considerably 
more savvy about rock 'n' roll. John Mello, 29, has put his music production 
company and recording session vocal work on hold temporarily while establishing 
the bar -- a two-person operation he shares with Linda, who left her job as an 
AIDS relief social worker to help run the place. 
</P>
<P>
Mello said his aim is to turn the Doll Hut into a regular hangout for musicians 
along the lines of the Commonwealth Pub, a now-defunct bar that was a magnet 
for the local rock scene in Fullerton during the mid-1980s. The Pontiac 
Brothers, in fact, got their 
</P>
<P>
start at the Commonwealth Pub when, under the name Gall Stones, they began 
playing covers of Rolling Stones songs just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the rock 'n' roll hangout," Mello said. "Social Distortion, the 
Adolescents -- everyone used to hang out there." The Doll Hut, he said, will be 
"just a place to come and have cheap beer and play if they want to play. I want 
the feeling of camaraderie, the feeling of musicians going in there to have a 
good time, leave their egos at the door, and not have to worry about the 
politics of the music business." 
</P>
<P>
With a legal capacity of 50, the Doll Hut won't try to compete with the area's 
admission-charging concert clubs. It doesn't have a sound system, or even a 
bandstand, so musicians will simply set up on the floor in the one empty corner 
that isn't occupied by the bar, the pool table or the dart board. No admission 
will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, an Austin, Tex., band called the Rattlers turned up to play, 
having discovered the bar while staying in the area. Fullerton rockers Cheezboy 
have also appeared. Members of the hard rock band Danzig have dropped in, Mello 
said, and so has Robin Williams, brought in one afternoon by one of Mello's 
friends in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
"No one even recognized him," Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
While building a younger rock following, the Doll Hut's new owners still aim to 
keep the working-class regulars from the bar's pre-rock days. The other night, 
a few longtime customers sat at a corner of the bar while younger rock fans 
surrounded the Rattlers in one corner or shot pool in another. 
</P>
<P>
"It don't bother me," said Chris Grundy, one of the pre-rock regulars. "It's a 
nice change." 
</P>
<P>
"The previous owners catered to older people. These kids are really turning it 
over. I like it," said Gil Lopez, a gray-haired customer who has been coming to 
the Doll Hut for six years. "There's music. It's alive." 
</P>
<P>
The Pontiac Brothers play Saturday night at 9 and 11 at the Doll Hut, 107 S. 
Adams St., Anaheim (at the corner of Manchester Avenue). Admission is free, but 
capacity is limited. Information: (714) 533-1286.

The latest payment of sales and use tax revenue to the cities of Orange County 
left municipal coffers $18.7 million richer. Santa Ana and Anaheim received the 
two largest amounts, but the per capita allocation was higher in several other 
cities, most notably in Costa Mesa, the highest. Villa Park received both the 
smallest total amount and the smallest per capita. 
</P>
<P>
Each month cities and counties and other governmental organizations receive 
from the state advance payments in anticipation of sales tax revenue. In the 
fourth month they receive an adjusted amount -- the difference between actual 
revenue and amounts previously received -- plus the first advance payment for 
the next quarter. The amounts listed here are for the second advance payment 
for the second quarter of 1989.

FIVE-COUNTY COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's total of $19.8 million received in the latest state 
disbursement of sales and use tax revenue ranked it second among Southern 
California's five major counties. Although only about one-third the size of the 
amount received by Los Angeles County, the local per capita amount was by far 
the highest. Nineteen percent of all the money allocated in the five counties 
ended up in Orange County; 10% of all the money in the state.

Fatal traffic accidents in Orange County fell to a five-year low of 244 in 
1988. That was a 12% decline from the year before. Not surprisingly, Anaheim 
and Santa Ana were the sites of the most accidents, while none occurred in 
either La Palma or Los Alamitos. In fact, there have been no fatal accidents in 
La Palma during any of the last five years -- the only city in the county that 
can make such a claim. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was also safer than its neighbors. There were fewer accidents 
here than in any of the surrounding counties, and the rate per thousand 
licensed drivers was lowest in the five-county area. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the fatal accident trend during the last five years in county cities and 
a 1988 comparison of Orange to the surrounding counties:

Seniors in 12 out of 15 Orange County high school districts demonstrated 
above-average writing skills last year in a new state test to determine writing 
proficiency, state education officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 79% of last year's senior class showed adequate to above-average 
writing skills, while 19% showed minimal ability, according to test results. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, all but three of the 15 high school districts scored above 
the state average. Santa Ana Unified, Anaheim Union High and Garden Grove 
Unified school districts -- all with large concentrations of 
limited-English-speaking students -- scored below the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-scoring district in the state was San Marino Unified in Los Angeles 
County. In Los Angeles Unified School District, last year's seniors scored well 
below the state average. 
</P>
<P>
The state average score on the California Assessment Program test was 250. The 
highest possible score was 400. Orange County high school seniors scored an 
average of 281 on the test. The highest-scoring district was Laguna Beach 
Unified, with 319. 
</P>
<P>
Last year was the first time that the state gave high school seniors the 
writing test, called the Direct Writing Assessment. Unlike earlier measures of 
writing ability, which emphasized multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank 
exercises, the new exam requires students to actually write sentences and 
paragraphs. The test covered four types of essays, including autobiographical, 
evaluative, interpretive and reflective writing.

The first military support personnel landed in Colombia today to await arrival 
of U.S. weapons and equipment under President Bush's $65-million emergency 
anti-drug aid package, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The first 10 Air Force support personnel arrived in Colombia from Panama and 
will begin logistical preparations for the unloading of military equipment for 
the Colombians that is expected to begin arriving Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said up to 100 U.S. military personnel under 
the supervision of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama are expected to take 
part in the operation to help train the Colombians in the use of the weapons 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. personnel will include computer operators, supply specialists, 
logistics personnel, maintenance specialists, munitions specialists and 
communication officials, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people will operate in a training capacity and they (the Colombians) will 
operate their own (U.S.-donated) equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the "normal rules of engagement apply," meaning that U.S. 
citizens going to Colombia will be allowed to protect themselves if fired on 
and "precautions will be made to ensure the safety of the personnel." He 
declined to elaborate.

The United States today cut diplomatic ties with the new Panamanian government 
backed by Manuel A. Noriega, branding it an outlaw regime and vowing to tighten 
the financial screws on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not recognize any government installed by Gen. Noriega. 
Our ambassador will not return and we will not have any diplomatic contact with 
the Noriega regime," President Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the announcement in Washington as Francisco Rodriguez was sworn in as 
provisional president in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
By citing "the outlaw Noriega regime," Bush summoned up one of the dominant 
phrases used by U.S. diplomats to describe how the Noriega government would be 
treated if the military leader refused to leave by today. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida 18 months ago, is also 
accused by the State Department of giving haven in the past to drug dealers 
from other Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States will take other steps, "including the tightening of 
measures to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the Panamanian 
people . . . and to counter the threat posed by Gen. Noriega's support for drug 
trafficking and other forms of subversion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Support 
</P>
<P>
The President did not specify what financial actions the United States will 
take against Panama but said he is confident that other countries would take 
similar measures to support human rights, democracy and self-determination and 
to fight drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Until today, Washington had recognized the government of President Eric 
Delvalle even though he had been removed from power in a February, 1988, coup 
and had been living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Delvalle, respecting the limits of his constitutional mandate, closed the 
Panamanian Embassy in Washington Thursday, handing it and more than $300 
million in Panamanian assets over to the United States for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of May 7 elections had been scheduled to take power Sept. 1, but 
the Noriega-controlled government annulled the elections after reports of a 
sweeping victory by opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
"On May 7, the people of Panama, by an overwhelming margin of votes, braved 
repression, intimidation and fraud to choose democracy over dictatorship. . . . 
But this act of self-determination was brutally repressed before the eyes of 
the entire world," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Legitimacy 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is, therefore, as of this date without any legitimate government," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said Washington, despite breaking relations, will 
keep open the U.S. Embassy in Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
If the break in relations continues, it will block the United States from 
taking crucial action called for in the Panama Canal treaties. Under the 
treaty, which calls for the United States to hand over the canal to Panama by 
the end of the century, the U.S. Senate must approve a Panamanian-appointed 
administrator for the canal by the end of 1989.

Scientists struggled today to revive a pygmy sperm whale that beached itself 
near Monterey, the first of its kind rescued on the West Coast in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Joseph M. Long Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz stayed up all 
night caring for the 6-foot-long whale, found by swimmers at Pajaro Dunes on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Worthy, a marine biologist and a whale expert at the lab, said the whale 
has only a 1-in-10 chance of surviving. The young whale, believed to be 1 to 2 
years old, suffers from "cookie-cutter" shark bites and long scratches, or 
"rake marks," probably inflicted by an adult of its species.

Baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti was rushed to a hospital after suffering a 
severe heart attack today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven McKinnon, deputy police chief of Edgartown, told ABC Radio Sports: "On 
arrival, the units found Mr. Giamatti in full cardiac arrest. CPR was initiated 
at the scene and was continued on board in the ambulance until arrival at 
Martha's Vineyard Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
State Policeman Byron Rizos said Giamatti suffered the heart attack at his home 
and was unconscious when police arrived at 3 p.m. Rizos said Giamatti was in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, 51, became baseball commissioner earlier this year after a stint as 
National League president. Before that, he was president of Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, he was involved in a heated legal dispute with Cincinnati 
Reds star Pete Rose, whom he accused of betting on baseball. Last week, he 
issued an order banishing Rose from baseball permanently.

Beijing will not allow a plane carrying Pope John Paul II to fly over China 
when he makes a visit to Asia next month, Italy's state airline said today. 
</P>
<P>
An Alitalia spokesman said Chinese officials refused a request by the airline 
to fly the papal plane over the Communist country, which does not allow its 
Catholics to recognize him as leader of the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope will visit South Korea, Indonesia, East Timor and Mauritius during an 
Oct. 6-16 trip, his 44th outside Italy. When the pontiff visited South Korea in 
1984 his plane flew the polar route from Rome to Seoul with a stop in Alaska. 
He did not fly over China at the time.

<P>
A warning of possible terrorist action was issued this week to airlines in the 
United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said the warning was contained in a general bulletin from the 
FAA that said a radical Palestinian group might be planning an attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing, location and the nature of the alleged attack is unknown," the 
newspaper quoted the bulletin as saying. It said the information about the 
possible attack came from the FBI's New York office. 
</P>
<P>
The warnings go to airlines but are not circulated to the general public, a 
policy that drew criticism in the wake of the December bombing of a Pan Am 
jetliner that crashed in Scotland, killing 270 people. Such a bulletin had been 
circulated before that crash.

Belgian radio listeners awoke to the chilling sound of Adolf Hitler declaring 
war on Poland, and Germans mourned their grim legacy to the world as Europeans 
today marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Jews, Poles, Russians, Germans and others gathered for memorials across the 
continent to remember the great conflict that began with the Nazi invasion of 
Poland. The events conjured somber memories of bomb shelters and concentration 
camps, of scrambled boundaries and splintered families. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, expressed sorrow 
and regret for the "unspeakable suffering" wrought by the Nazis. He also tried 
to assuage lingering German guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were blinded and 
deceived by that tyrant," Kohl said of Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
"Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted with such evil, 
they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs? And who among us can judge 
what it meant at that time to risk not only one's own life but the lives of 
one's family as well?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
In Communist East Berlin, ailing leader Erich Honecker missed the memorial 
ceremony in the 500-member People's Chamber, where Foreign Minister Oskar 
Fischer delivered the main address. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer called for a day of "recollection and sorrow" and said the East German 
leaders pledge "to do everything in our power to ensure that war and fascism 
never again threaten our lives and the lives of our children." 
</P>
<P>
Poland's leaders marked the occasion with a symbolic show of unity by the 
Communists and the Solidarity labor movement they once crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and 
former Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now the prime minister, appeared 
together at a small Polish garrison in Gdansk that bore the first Nazi 
onslaught on Sept. 1, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
"On this day of great national memories we look not only into the past but also 
into the future," said Jaruzelski, flanked by two men he once jailed. 
</P>
<P>
"Let this be an oath in this sacred place," Jaruzelski said, his voice 
trembling. "Poland stood the toughest trial of war with honor. On this 
exceptional day we have the moral right to address all nations and governments 
of Europe. We want to have friends close to us, and far away" -- an obvious 
reference to the Warsaw Pact nation's efforts to reach out to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eager to keep Poland in the Soviet sphere 
as that nation flirts with reform, said in a message to Jaruzelski: "The Polish 
people and their army were the first to bear the brunt of Germany's powerful 
military machine. 
</P>
<P>
"These tragic events were actually prompted by the inability of the states 
threatened by fascism and militarism to rally together and set up a collective 
security system." 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, BRT state radio woke up listeners with a spine-tingling flash from 
the past: a tape of Hitler declaring war on Poland on the same day he had 
launched the first attacks. The frenzied fuehrer's incitements were followed by 
the cheers of adoring Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway station to 
remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape Hitler's "blitzkrieg" 
bombings.

A federal judge today absolved the National Weather Service of negligence in 
the 1985 fatal crash of a Delta Air Lines jet during a severe thunderstorm at 
Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In a 72-page opinion, U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr. said that Delta 
"failed to prove that the United States of America was guilty of any 
negligence." 
</P>
<P>
In the longest major aviation trial in U.S. history, attorneys for Delta had 
argued that the weather service was to blame for the crash that killed 132 
people because crew members did not have sufficient warning about the severity 
of a thunderstorm at the airport. The airline had sought to make the government 
pay all or part of the millions of dollars in claims arising from the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed L-1011 crashed trying to land on Aug. 2, 1985, when it was caught 
in a wind shear, a sudden change of wind speed.

Lyphomed Inc. said today it has agreed to be bought by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical 
Co. Ltd., a Japanese firm that already owns 30% of the drug manufacturer, for 
about $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lyphomed, based in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, enjoyed explosive growth in 
the mid-1980s, largely through its sales of pentamidine, a drug used to treat 
AIDS-related pneumonia. Overall sales soared from $4 million to $172 million 
from 1981 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Lyphomed makes primarily injectable pharmaceutical products used by critically 
ill people. 
</P>
<P>
The company ran into hard times last year after the federal Food and Drug 
Administration uncovered quality control problems at several Lyphomed plants. 
It lost $21.1 million in 1988. Lyphomed has since shuffled top management and 
posted a profit of $105,000 on revenues of $71.7 million in the first six 
months of 1989.

Pan American World Airways has agreed to pay $2.35 million to settle a lawsuit 
by 116 flight attendants claiming the carrier's weight policy discriminated 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit, which was filed five years ago in San Francisco by the 
Independent Union of Flight Attendants, said the Pan Am attendants were fired, 
forced to resign or denied promotions because the airline decided they were 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a federal judge in the Northern District of California ruled in favor 
of the flight attendants and ordered Pan Am to change its policy that sets 
limits on how much flight attendants could weigh. Pan Am had appealed that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement announced Thursday, Pan Am agreed to withdraw its appeal 
without admitting any wrongdoing and establish a more liberal weight policy.

A "work force crisis" will cripple the United States' ability to compete 
internationally without immediate steps to improve the education, training and 
efficiency of U.S. workers, said a report submitted today to Labor Secretary 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference where Dole received the report, the secretary said the 
problems in the work force require the attention of business, labor, government 
and private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The skills of our work force have not kept pace with the more complex jobs of 
today," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was produced by the Commission on Workforce Quality and Labor Market 
Efficiency, created in 1988 by Dole's predecessor, Ann McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's 44 recommendations cover three broad fronts: improving 
education for young people, providing lifetime education and training for 
workers, and improving productivity and efficiency by providing more help to 
working parents and developing a system to better match workers with jobs.

The Energy Department said today it has resumed commercial sales of tritium 
after investigators concluded that missing amounts of the radioactive gas were 
not diverted for use in building nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Department spokesman Phil Keif said discrepancies over how much tritium 
was shipped to commercial customers had been resolved, except for the cases of 
two British companies, Surelite and Saunders-Roe Developments Ltd. An 
investigation is continuing. He said department officials had discounted the 
possibility that the missing amounts had been diverted to bomb production. 
</P>
<P>
Tritium is used in biological and energy research and for production of 
luminous lights such as those used on airport runways, as well as signs, dials 
and watches. It is used in nuclear warheads to boost the weapons' explosive 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department had announced last July that it was halting commercial 
sales until it could account for about 5 grams of missing tritium. Total annual 
commercial sales of the man-made gas are about 180 grams, it said.

Agents and managers of the world's track and field stars issued a strong 
challenge to the sport's authorities today, urging them to treat the athletes 
as full professionals and "move with the times." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of six-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis, world 110-meter 
hurdles record-holder Roger Kingdom, 400-meter world record-holder Butch 
Reynolds, Kenyan 800-meter Olympic champion Paul Ereng and more than 20 other 
agents set up the International Assn. of Athlete Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Its aim is to abolish amateurism and give the athletes complete freedom to run 
their own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point declaration, the new association said it wants to "protect the 
rights of athletes to compete and to earn compensation in a free and open 
market . . . without restriction." 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal included a recommendation to abolish the trust fund concept 
and replace it with a system in which athletes "freely, openly and honestly 
accept remuneration from meet organizers and sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
The agents also called for the lifting of all restrictions imposed by the 
sport's world governing body on the wearing of sponsors' names and logos during 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation does not allow competitors to 
prominently display manufacturers' or advertisers' names on their uniforms or 
equipment during competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize we cannot ourselves change the rules," said David Greifinger, an 
attorney for Lewis and the Santa Monica Track Club. "But by issuing this 
declaration, we are saying these are the rules we want to be in place. Now, 
IAAF, get with it." 
</P>
<P>
Greifinger said that the sport is now virtually professional and that the world 
governing body has no option but to "move with the times." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in the long run that they can afford not to follow most of our 
recommendations," Greifinger told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, our recommendations reflect reality. The economic pressures of the 
sport will require that the IAAF go along with these recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
But Jon Wigley, IAAF director of competitions, said the organization will not 
be held to ransom. 
</P>
<P>
"Any group of private individuals has the right to express an opinion," he 
said. "But I don't know with what authority this group is speaking. The 
declaration runs against the principle of the IAAF and leaves no room for 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Wigley said that under present rules, individual agents must be authorized by 
member track federations, the only bodies that had any standing within the 
IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are serious about this declaration, they should take it back to the 
member federations for discussion, not just put it forward as a political 
confrontation," Wigley said. 
</P>
<P>
Greifinger said the IAAR would be happy to do this. 
</P>
<P>
In Indianapolis, site of the Athletics Congress, the U.S. governing body, 
spokesman Pete Cava said: "All they've done is make an announcement. They 
haven't implemented any changes."

GLAD TO BE BACK; 
</P>
<P>
ALLEN BREAKS HIS HOLDOUT ON RAIDERS 
</P>

Marcus Allen's long, silent holdout ended this morning. He walked in, told 
Raiders Coach Mike Shanahan that he was glad to be back and was sent out to 
take his physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
Allen will not dress for today's exhibition against the Bears, but he's 
scheduled to play in next week's opener against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a negotiated settlement. Al Davis stuck to his no-talk posture 
throughout the five-week absence. Allen will play for the $1.1 million due him 
on this, the option year on his three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Allen reportedly wanted something more in line with the $1.356 million Bo 
Jackson will get, for playing half a season. A friend of Allen's said, however, 
that Allen "just wanted to be shown some respect." 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen today: "The reasons for the holdout are personal. I don't want to 
elaborate on them. I just felt it was time to go back to work." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's salary puts him second in the league only to Eric Dickerson among 
running backs. Of Jackson's total, $996,000 is paid in deferred bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been in five Pro Bowls and is the Raiders' all-time leader in rushing 
and touchdowns. He led the league in 1985 with 1,759 yards and was named Most 
Valuable Player by Associated Press, the Sporting News and the Professional 
Football Writers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He had a string of 11 100-yard games that stretched into the third game of the 
'86 season, when he sustained an ankle injury against the Giants. His rushes 
dropped by one-third and his season total dropped 1,000 yards to 759. 
</P>
<P>
Beset by more injuries in '87-88, his rushing totals stayed relatively low, 754 
and 831 yards, respectively. He maintained his value by playing hurt (he went 
most of last season with a cast on his broken left wrist) and by moving 
gracefully to fullback to accommodate Jackson. Allen's teammates have voted him 
the team's most valuable player in four of the last five seasons.
