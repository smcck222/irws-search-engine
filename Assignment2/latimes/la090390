SURROGATE PARENTING

<TEXT>

"Hard cases make bad law." We make law based on the normal case, not the 
exception. Surrogate contracts should be routinely viewed as valid and subject 
to normal contract law. 
</P>
<P>
The claim of Anna Johnson is clearly invalid. She is not a parent of the child, 
merely a baby-sitter or nurse for an extremely young child and prospective 
adopter if for some reason the parents were found not able or willing to raise 
their child. 
</P>
<P>
The Times feels it is somehow inhumane to view this as a contract. But not to 
do so is obviously inhumane. That would be to forbid people to arrange things 
in a manner they both find satisfactory. Nor do we clarify the legal picture by 
removing the profit motive. In fact, we remove one of the clearer standards 
from consideration and have to go by fuzzy ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' suggestion for a legislative approach clashes with its own 
acknowledgement that "writing rules to cover any contingency will be difficult, 
perhaps impossible." Our best course is largely to treat these rare cases as 
pure contract disputes. Surrogate parents are not a subject for some bureaucrat 
to foul up.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's absolutely infuriating to read about an individual who sues another for 
something that is practically impossible to decide fairly. 
</P>
<P>
I'm referring to the article about the surrogate, Anna Johnson, who is suing 
the biological parents of the child she is carrying for "fetal neglect" (Aug. 
14). 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had an agreement with Cris and Mark Calvert to bear their child since 
Mrs. Calvert was unable to do so. That should be it. What gives her (or anybody 
else) the right to decide that the Calverts will not be suitable parents when 
too many variables are involved? 
</P>
<P>
It's cases like this that weigh down our court system and make it unworkable.

<P>
I am deeply concerned and critical of Gov. Deukmejian's unwise decision to cut 
funding for the California Assessment Program (CAP). In the light of increasing 
criticism of our national education policies, we can ill afford the loss of yet 
another educational program. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Artesia High School, my fellow seniors and I were looking 
forward to increasing the scores for our school. We saw the CAP test and our 
school scores as a rallying point for campus pride. 
</P>
<P>
The logic in the governor's decision escapes me. I can only hope that the new 
governor will show more concern for the state's troubled schools by restoring 
funds for CAP, among other things. I can also say that Gov. Deukmejian's 
dubious abilities, demonstrated by the CAP and his handling of Proposition 98, 
have made me Democrat on state issues, while I am still Republican on national 
ones.

REDUCING CLASS SIZES IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to William Trombley's News Analysis, "No Simple Answer to Class 
Size," Aug. 26: 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher with 17 years experience in the classroom and a parent of young 
children just about to enter the school system, I am deeply concerned about the 
issue of class size. I am completely fed up and somewhat jealous when hearing 
from friends who are teachers and parents in other parts of the country who 
teach or have children in classes of 15 or 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of traveling to Japan, why doesn't Gov. Deukmejian visit other school 
districts in this country and find out how they do it? 
</P>
<P>
Also, I believe that if any administrator, school board president, taxpayer or 
governor would spend a minimum of six weeks in any classroom teaching 30 to 35 
children, he or she would beg, borrow or steal the funds necessary to reduce 
class size. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to offer a solution to this problem: Drastically reduce the number 
of school administrators. Assign two credentialed teachers to each classroom of 
30 to 32 students. No new classrooms need to be built, our students will be 
served in a far greater capacity and teacher morale will skyrocket.

Gov. Deukmejian said, "Ever since I've been governor, I've been getting nothing 
but complaints about class size." Perhaps if the governor had to work 
effectively with 35-40 other employees sharing his office, he would reconsider 
his priorities and realize class size in our public schools is an extremely 
important issue that must be dealt with now!

CATALYST FOR LABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK SHEEHAN, 42, of Pasadena, was a union leader at Los Angeles 
International Airport at the time of the strike by the Professional Air Traffic 
Controllers Organization (Patco) in 1981. Now an area representative for the 
American Federation of Labor, he believes labor learned a lesson from the 
strike. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trends in the country (then) were not good for labor. If it wasn't for (the 
strike by Patco), labor wouldn't have the solidarity it does now. 
</P>
<P>
It was the catalyst for a lot of what is happening today. I don't think anyone 
in labor expected Patco to do it. I don't think anyone thought (President) 
Reagan would (fire the controllers). 
</P>
<P>
The labor movement is much stronger (now). Patco pretty much opened the door 
for management to say, "We're not going to negotiate with you." But over the 
years since the Patco strike, people have learned from that. Union people have 
become stronger. They're willing to take a stand. A strike is a last-ditch 
effort. They know that. (But) the goal is worth going after. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to think that a part of the reason (labor is better off today) is 
because of Patco. The (outcome) was an embarrassment for some labor leaders.

MOSCOW'S CYNICAL AGENDA;

<P>
SOVIET ACTIONS IN IRAQ CAST DOUBT ON ALL THIS 'NEW WORLD ORDER' TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK J. GAFFNEY JR., Frank J. Gaffney Jr., formerly a senior Defense 
Department official, is director of the Center for Security Policy in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent days, senior Bush Administration spokesmen and some non-governmental 
foreign-policy experts have served notice on the American people: A "new world 
order" is emerging to fill a vacuum created by the reputed demise of the Cold 
War. They suggest that, if the United States will join the Soviet Union in 
playing a constructive part in the ensuing arrangement, international affairs 
will henceforth be more stable and secure. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of the arrival of this new world order, proponents point to the 
recent series of U.N. Security Council resolutions condemning Saddam Hussein's 
aggression and establishing an embargo on imports to and exports from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But Soviet cooperation in the Iraq crisis has not been "superb," as President 
Bush suggested on Aug. 22. Soviet advisers in Iraq are continuing to perform 
vital functions for the Iraqi military -- notwithstanding the U.N. embargo on 
supplying goods and services to Baghdad. And there are enough reports of Soviet 
cooperation with Iraqi security agents and other forms of mischief to suggest 
that Moscow is pursuing its own agenda, even when doing so is at cross-purposes 
with stated Soviet policy, to say nothing of Western interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration and foreign intelligence sources have tried to minimize the 
significance of these sinister Soviet activities -- activities that are 
fundamentally at variance with the spirit (if not the letter) of the U.N. 
resolutions, the mandated sanctions and Mikhail Gorbachev's public statements 
-- by suggesting that they are the work of "rogue" military officers, 
unresponsive to civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
Such an explanation is extremely troubling. If true, the contention that the 
Soviet military can and does act without regard for -- even in direct 
contravention of -- the wishes or commitments of the Kremlin's civilian 
authorities calls into question the prudence of U.S. policies that stake 
American security to a considerable extent on the good faith of that Soviet 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But if such an explanation is untrue, then Gorbachev and the other civilian 
leaders of the Soviet Union are party to a cynical double game, one in which 
they seek simultaneously to nurture improved relations with the United States 
and its allies -- particularly improved access to Western capital and 
technology -- while retaining great latitude to advance their own agenda at the 
West's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet behavior at the United Nations appears to support the double-game 
thesis. The Soviets stalled Security Council approval of the "use of force" 
resolution for days, insisting on evidence that the sanctions were being 
violated before force could be used. They also demanded that any such military 
response be made under the rubric of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
While the Soviet Union may have receded for the moment from these demands, 
settling for a more ambiguous formulation of the resolution and an affirmation 
that political and diplomatic measures would receive maximum use, the principal 
Soviet objective seems to have been served: to delay U.S. action and to 
increase the pressure against unilateral American military steps. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin's approach appears designed not so much to gain speedy resolution 
of the crisis as to strengthen its own potential hand as crisis mediator -- in 
effect standing between the United States and Iraq, while resisting effective 
U.S. action. Such behavior belies the claim that the Soviet Union is 
contributing to the emergence of a new world order to which U.S. security 
interests can safely be entrusted. Put bluntly, the so-called emerging world 
order appears to be principally a vehicle for the Soviet Union and others to 
constrain the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Bush Administration's determination to pursue partnership 
with Moscow (inside and outside of the United Nations) -- seemingly at 
virtually any price -- plays into Soviet hands. At the very least, such a 
policy is highly susceptible to Kremlin efforts to encumber vital American 
freedom of action. As a practical matter, it may even preclude the United 
States from properly defending vital U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's double game is likely over the short run to embolden Iraq while 
constraining the United States, a formula for enormously increasing the stature 
of Saddam Hussein and the Soviet Union in Arab eyes while dangerously 
diminishing U.S. standing throughout the region. Over the longer run, 
Washington's willingness to play along, in the misguided expectation that doing 
so will advance some new world order, will actually increase the prospects for 
instability and conflict.

BASEBALL: PITCHER GETS HIS 17TH WIN OF THE SEASON, GETTING OUT OF A 
BASES-LOADED, ONE-OUT SITUATION IN THE SEVENTH INNING. HOWELL HITS HOME RUN IN 
1-0 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
There may be two runners on base or three, two outs to be recorded or one. The 
details of the predicaments vary from game to game, but Chuck Finley's uncanny 
ability to escape trouble remains constant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like those kinds of things, but I'm real comfortable and I don't 
panic," the Angel left-hander said. "I don't know if it's maturing as a pitcher 
and being able to relax -- it might have come from giving up so many runs in 
other years I got tired of seeing it happen." 
</P>
<P>
As it happened in the seventh inning Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, the White Sox 
had the bases loaded with one out and the Angels clinging to a one-run lead. "I 
had the feeling there weren't going to be that many runs (scored by the 
Angels), and I was headed for a no-decision or a loss if I gave up a run 
there," Finley said. "It was win the game or what." 
</P>
<P>
Winning excused him from having to define "what." Finley struck out 
pinch-hitters Carlos Martinez and Ron Karkovice to end that threat and lasted 
into the eighth before yielding to Bryan Harvey, who preserved the 1-0 victory. 
It gave Finley a career-best 17th victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels about as good as it did when I got my 16th. It's just a number," 
Finley (17-6) said after striking out six over 7 1/3 innings and reducing his 
earned-run average to 2.43, second in the American League to the 1.95 of 
Boston's Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
"I've bettered myself by one game from last year, and I'm three ahead in the 
loss column. Whatever happens from here, I'll be real happy. . . . I've been 
asked about 20 ever since I won my 14th. If I start thinking about it now, I'll 
end up being 17-10. I take them one at a time. That's the way I got here. If I 
change that it's like changing my pitching style, and that wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Howell produced the only run with a fifth-inning home run off rookie 
right-hander Alex Fernandez (2-2), as the White Sox fell 6 1/2 games behind the 
AL West-leading Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad pitch, I guess," said Fernandez, who defeated the Angels, 4-2, 
last Thursday at Comiskey Park. "If I would have gotten him out, it would have 
been a good pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Several good defensive plays helped the Angels avert a sweep and begin their 
six-game trip to New York and Baltimore with a .500 record. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's other contribution was to charge Ivan Calderon's eighth-inning 
grounder on the bumpy infield and get Calderon at first base while holding 
Sammy Sosa at second. Dave Winfield threw out Carlton Fisk at the plate in the 
fifth when the 42-year-old catcher tried to score on Scott Fletcher's fly to 
right -- a play Manager Doug Rader called "like hitting a solo home run" -- and 
catcher Lance Parrish chipped in by picking Ozzie Guillen off second for the 
final out. 
</P>
<P>
"The game belongs to many," Winfield said. "Chuck pitched well, it ended with 
Lance, Jack did a little bit and I'll take the last little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Howell had waited for his seventh home run of the season. His last homer was 
seven weeks and one visit to triple-A Edmonton ago, and he has returned with 
renewed assurance. "The thing I feel best about is that I carried what I did in 
Edmonton and brought it here," he said. "Even now, when I have a couple of 
at-bats where I press, I'm able to go back, after a couple of at-bats, to what 
I know works." 
</P>
<P>
Finley labored in the seventh after Frank Thomas doubled, Fisk walked on four 
pitches and rookie Matt Stark moved them up with a sacrifice. Rader ordered 
Scott Fletcher walked intentionally -- the fourth consecutive game he has used 
that strategy after ordering only 18 in the previous 130 games -- and Manager 
Jeff Torborg sent Martinez to hit for Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We got ahead of him pretty quick," Parrish recalled of Martinez's flailing 
swing and foul ball for an 0-and-2 count, "but I don't know if Chuck started 
trying to push it or put the ball in the perfect position, but we went with the 
forkball three times and it was outside. Three and two with the bases loaded, 
we had to come at him. It was in a perfect spot, down and in." 
</P>
<P>
Finley got a 1-and-2 count on Karkovice before throwing a breaking ball that he 
missed. "I don't know if Chuck particularly cares to be in those situations, 
but he pitches well once he's in them," Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who can become the Angels' first 20-game winner since Nolan Ryan in 
1974, is tied for third in the AL in victories, eighth with 139 strikeouts and 
fifth with a .739 winning percentage. There's no official ranking for scoring 
threats defused, but he must be among the leaders there, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Winfield's throw and Parrish's throw were the two key defensive plays," Rader 
said, "but overall, the fact that Chuck pitched out of jams was the key. He did 
most of the work. He's done it for a couple of years, especially this year. 
He's worked out of some tough situations and done a very fine job." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey converted his seventh consecutive save opportunity and 20th in 23 
chances with 1 2/3 hitless innings. His 87% success rate matches White Sox 
reliever Bobby Thigpen, who tied the major-league record Saturday with his 46th 
save. Thigpen equaled the record in 53 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to do the job every time I get in that situation," said Harvey, who 
is 1-1 with 16 saves and an earned-run average of 0.90 in 27 appearances since 
May 24. "Next year, I'd just like to be consistent from the beginning instead 
of after the first month and a half."

Jim Gallagher Jr. was first off the tee and first in the hole Sunday to win a 
three-way playoff for the $900,000 Greater Milwaukee Open at Franklin, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in his seven-year career Gallagher had finished first in 
a PGA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It was up to them to make the putts," Gallagher said. "I was in good shape. 
The ones they had to make were tough." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher made an eight-foot putt for par on the par-three 17th hole and then 
watched as Ed Dougherty and Billy Mayfair missed tying putts from nearly the 
same distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Going first made a difference. I wanted to get it in the hole. I had the best 
putt. After I saw them hit their tee shots, I just said get it close and tap it 
in," Gallagher said after collecting a $162,000 first-place check. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty hit his tee shot into the bunker, chipped out and missed his putt 
from about eight feet. Mayfair, who had a one-shot lead before bogeying the 
final hole of regulation, hit his tee shot past the green, chipped back past 
the hole and then missed an eight-footer. 
</P>
<P>
The three had finished tied at 17-under 271 through 72 holes, forcing the 
playoff. Mayfair had a final-round 68 and Gallagher and Dougherty each shot 66. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hill birdied the first hole of a sudden-death playoff to beat Bruce 
Crampton and win a $450,000 Senior PGA Tour event at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's second shot on the par-four, 364-yard 16th hole landed three inches from 
the cup. He tapped in for the birdie. Crampton's approach landed beyond the 
green and his third shot went past the cup, leaving him a long putt. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by a stroke, Hill birdied the 482-yard 17th hole to tie Crampton, who 
shot a 66. Crampton missed a chance to win on the 18th when his birdie attempt 
from the fringe stopped on the edge of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel had six birdies for a 69 to tie Martha Nause for the lead after two 
rounds of a $275,000 LPGA tournament at Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel finished with a 36-hole total of eight-under-par 136. Nause shot a 67, 
the lowest round of the day.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S ANOTHER HOME VICTORY FOR METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The New York Mets would probably be a cinch to win the National League East if 
they didn't have to go back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
When they came home from a difficult trip to the West Coast early last week, 
they were three games out of first place. But they'll go out on the road again 
with a half-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
The team with the best home record in the majors completed a 6-0 stand with a 
10-6 victory Sunday that about ended the San Francisco Giants' hopes of 
repeating in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who scored three runs in the first inning against David Cone (11-7) 
and had 17 hits, lost their fourth in a row and dropped 10 1/2 games behind 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Giants were swept in a four-game series at New York 
since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have 31 games left, including 18 on the road where they have a 30-33 
record. They are 46-22 at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries to their pitching staff, the Giants gave rookie Paul 
McClellan his first start, but he couldn't hold the 3-0 lead. He's the 26th 
pitcher the Giants have used this season and is the 14th to start a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cone, who has been the Mets' most consistent pitcher since the All-Star break, 
gave up the three runs before he retired a batter. He left after giving up 11 
hits and trailed, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Teufel, who scored three runs, opened the fifth with his eighth home run 
and the Mets chased McClellan and took the lead for good, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to win six in a row at home," Manager Bud Harrelson said, "but now 
we have to show we can win on the road, if we want to win it all." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, Houston 6 -- The Pirates blew a 2-0 lead in the ninth inning 
Friday night, lost in the 10th Saturday night and barely hung on in this one 
after building a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
A run-scoring single by Franklin Stubbs brought the Astros to within a run in 
the bottom of the ninth and they had runners on first and third with one out. 
But left-hander Bob Kipper struck out Gerald Young and retired Eric Yelding on 
a routine fly to center to end it. 
</P>
<P>
When the Astros fell short in the ninth, it ended the nine-game winning streak 
of Danny Darwin (10-2). Darwin gave up a three-run homer to Jeff King in the 
sixth to fall five runs behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates return home to play Philadelphia. The Pirates, who are 37-27 at 
home, have 17 home games left and 13 on the road, where they are 39-29. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6, Chicago 2 -- If someone had told Manager Lou Piniella a couple of 
months ago that his most dependable starters in the Reds' bid to clinch the 
West would be Jose Rijo and Rick Mahler, he probably wouldn't have believed it. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo (11-6) gave up nine hits at Chicago, but went the distance for his third 
consecutive victory. Mahler won his third in a row Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The newest Red, Bill Doran, filling in at third base, led the attack on Greg 
Maddux (12-12). He had a double and a single, scored two runs and drove in one. 
</P>
<P>
By winning three out of four from the Cubs, the Reds kept their 6 1/2-game lead 
over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, Philadelphia 1 -- Ed Whitson, one of the hottest pitchers in the 
majors, won his fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
He went seven innings at Philadelphia, giving up six hits. In his last eight 
outings, including three no decisions, Whitson, who leads the league with a 
2.31 earned-run average, has an 0.99 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, St. Louis 0 -- Charlie Leibrandt (7-8) gave up 10 hits at Atlanta, 
but didn't walk a batter, so he wound up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor (11-4) returned from the disabled list to give up only four hits, 
but the two walks he gave up in the third inning and Ron Gant's two-out double 
were enough to beat him. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
REPLACEMENT BAINES HOMERS AND A'S WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the reasons the Oakland Athletics have been successful is their ability 
to replace players quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the few times General Manager Sandy Alderson has been slow to come 
up with a replacement was when Dave Parker opted for free agency last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Parker had been the primary left-handed hitter on two pennant winners. It took 
most of this season for Alderson to find the right replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Baines is the man. Baines paid his first major dividend Sunday at 
Oakland when he homered to lead the Athletics to a 4-2 victory over the Texas 
Rangers. With Chicago losing, the Athletics stretched their lead in the 
American League West to 6 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Baines, in his fourth game with the Athletics after being obtained from the 
Rangers, led off the second inning with a home run over the center-field fence. 
He hit a 2-0 pitch from Charlie Hough for his 14th homer. 
</P>
<P>
It triggered a three-run rally in which Willie Randolph, another timely 
replacement, tripled in one run and scored another. 
</P>
<P>
Baines said his first home run for his new team was no big deal, but Manager 
Tony La Russa begged to differ. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big hit, and he's had some big hits like that against us," La Russa 
said. "I like having him doing it for us now." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (12-12) gave up four hits in 6 1/3 innings, then La Russa brought in 
his left-right bullpen tandem of Rick Honeycutt and Dennis Eckersley. Eckersley 
struck out two of the three batters he faced for his 41st save. Moore left the 
game with a bruised right wrist after he tagged Jeff Kunkel in a rundown. 
</P>
<P>
Baines enables La Russa to split his right-handed power duo of Jose Canseco and 
Mark McGwire. His presence will make it tougher to pitch to the two sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson stole his 925th base and scored the extra run in the seventh 
on a single by Canseco. Henderson, bothered by a hamstring injury, has 29 games 
left this season to catch Lou Brock, the all-time leader, who stole 938. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, New York 1 -- Mike Greenwell drove in four runs and Ellis Burks three 
at Boston and Tom Bolton (8-2) limited the Yankees to three hits in eight 
innings. It was the first time in the 88-year rivalry the Red Sox swept the 
home series, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Burks has driven in seven runs in the last two games, is batting .536 in the 
last seven games and has driven in 15 of the 63 runs the Red Sox have scored in 
those games. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell has driven in nine runs in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
It was a reversal of form for Bolton. He had been knocked about early in his 
three previous starts and had not won since Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees put the first two batters on base in the ninth and Larry Andersen 
made his Red Sox debut. He hit pinch-hitter Kevin Maas to fill the bases. 
Andersen retired the next three batters, the run scoring on an infield out. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Baltimore 2 -- Jaime Navarro, in his third strong outing in a row, 
carried a shutout into the ninth inning at Milwaukee and pitched the Brewers to 
their 10th victory in the last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Devereaux's two-out, two-run home run spoiled Navarro's bid for a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro's turnaround came after two appearances against Kansas City in which he 
gave up 11 runs in less than four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro (6-5) has won three in a row, during which his ERA is 1.71. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Detroit 3 -- Greg Gagne hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning 
at Minneapolis to give the Twins a lead, then had to make like a football 
player to save it in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
With the Twins leading, 4-2, Gary Ward was on first when Chet Lemon hit a pop 
fly into left field. Gagne collided with left fielder Dan Gladden, cartwheeled 
over him and held the ball. A walk and a single followed before Rick Aguilera 
got the save on a game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny had told me he was going to play deep," Gagne said, "so I didn't expect 
him to be there. I knew I had to catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Seattle 0 -- Tom Gordon (10-9) pitched a six-hitter at Seattle 
for his fourth complete game in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson was out of the lineup again for the Royals, but he wasn't missed. 
Danny Tartabull drove in five runs with a double and his 15th home run, and 
George Brett had three hits, two of them doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson strained his right shoulder in Saturday's game. DAN HAFNER

DEL MAR;

WHILE STEVENS IS AWAY, SOLIS MAKES HAY, WINNING ON BEYOND PERFECTION 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Stevens wasn't the only jockey who benefited from Golden Pheasant's upset 
victory in the Arlington Million. 
</P>
<P>
So did Alex Solis. 
</P>
<P>
With Stevens busy providing Charlie Whittingham with his third Million success 
in Illinois, Solis inherited the mount on Beyond Perfection in the $290,400 Del 
Mar Debutante. 
</P>
<P>
The way the 2-year-old Quack filly ran Sunday, Solis and agent Craig O'Bryan 
will also be happy to know it's wasn't a one-shot deal. Trainer Jack Van Berg 
said he will stick with Solis. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three weeks after being beaten by 4 1/2 lengths by Lite Light in the 
seven-furlong Sorrento Stakes, Beyond Perfection turned things around in a big 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Never looking like a loser at any stage, the 3-1 third choice took the lead 
from the start and at the end of her 1:34 4/5 mile had beaten Lite Light, the 
9-5 favorite, by nine lengths. The final time was a Debutante record, eclipsing 
one-fifth a mark shared by Table Hands and last year's winner, Rue De Palm. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive in her July 15 debut at Hollywood Park, Beyond Perfection put up no 
resistance when challenged by Lite Light in the Sorrento. But when Lite Light 
made a mild run at her Sunday, Beyond Perfection found another gear. "She just 
ran away from me," said Russell Baze, Lite Light's jockey. "She didn't put up 
that kind of defense last time. It was no contest today." 
</P>
<P>
Van Berg, who has found winners hard to come by in Southern California -- the 
Debutante was his first victory in 23 starts at Del Mar -- didn't lose faith in 
the filly, a Kentucky-bred owned by John Franks. 
</P>
<P>
"She got upset in her last race here, she was nervous and rank on the 
backside," he said. "We took some time and schooled her. She gallops faster in 
the morning than most horses can run. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time Gary Stevens rode her he said when this filly gets a route of 
ground she'll be a top filly. Alex was never on her back before today. I told 
him what to do and he did everything perfect. This filly has shown as much as 
any I've had my hands on, maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
Purchased by Franks at the Barretts Sale in Pomona for $32,000 several months 
earlier, Beyond Perfection won't be back to try the boys in the Del Mar 
Futurity a week from Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to get some time," said Van Berg. "We'll take her back to 
Hollywood Park and decide what's next. We want to go to the Breeders' Cup with 
her. The further she goes, the better she'll be; she keeps loping along." 
</P>
<P>
Unsettled before the Sorrento, Beyond Perfection was a model of decorum Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"She went to the gate real quiet and was very calm," said Solis. "(Van Berg) 
just told me to try to get her to relax and that she'd be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"She just galloped around out there. She does everything right and she can 
really run. She has some kind of a stride on her." 
</P>
<P>
Title Bought, the 5-2 second choice, was third, 2 1/2 lengths behind Lite 
Light. Nice Assay was fourth, then came Alyfair, Gold Fleece and Brazen, who 
was some 24 lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Fly Till Dawn will try to repeat his Eddie Read Handicap upset when he takes on 
11 rivals in today's $300,000 Del Mar Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Against a field which is made up primarily of allowance horses, the 4-year-old 
Swing Till Dawn colt will be a lot shorter price than the 13-1 he was three 
weeks ago when beating Arlington Million winner Golden Pheasant, Classic Fame 
and five others in the Grade I Read. 
</P>
<P>
Fly Till Dawn also doesn't figure to get the same kind of easy lead he did Aug. 
12 -- he went 48 3/5 and 1:12 2/5 en route to the 1:48 1/5 final time -- 
because of Royal Reach, who has gone wire-to-wire in three of his last four 
turf starts. There's also a distance question for Darrell Vienna's gray colt. 
The Del Mar Handicap is 1 3/8 miles, a quarter mile longer than the Read. 
</P>
<P>
Runner-up to Petite Ile in Hollywood Park's Sunset Handicap, Live The Dream is 
the 118-pound highweight for trainer Charlie Whittingham. The Northern Baby 
colt has won five of 16 on turf, but his best work has come at Hollypark. Alex 
Solis rides Live The Dream, who worked a mile in 1:39 3/5 over the course nine 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant returned $14 at Del Mar for his Arlington Million victory, 
compared to $15.20 at Arlington Park. . . . Beyond Perfection's victory was 
worth $110,000 to owner John Franks. . . . Supplemented for $10,000, Beyond 
Perfection was the fifth consecutive supplementary entrant to win the 
Debutante, joining Arewehavingfunyet, Brave Raj, Lost Kitty, Lea Lucinda and 
Rue De Palm. . . . Cee's Tizzy was one of nine 3-year-olds entered in 
Wednesday's $75,000-added El Cajon Stakes at 1 1/16 miles on the main track. A 
gray son of Relaunch, Cee's Tizzy stretched out for the first time in an 
allowance race Aug. 19 and ran a mile in 1:33 2/5, winning by nearly three 
lengths under Eddie Delahoussaye. If he is a starter -- trainer John Russell is 
also considering the Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup Sunday -- Cee's Tizzy will 
face Oh Wow, Warcraft, Prudent Leader, Hawaiian Pass, Asia, Shinko Wine, Toby 
Jug and Bel Air Paster.

FOOTNOTES: A HIGH-TECH SEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the Good Housekeeping "Seal of Approval?" Well, it now has a high-tech 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
Info World, a weekly magazine on the PC industry, has introduced its own "buyer 
assurance seal" of approval. The seal, which is expected to appear on computer 
hardware and software packaging this fall, will establish safeguards that 
include a 60-day repair or replace guarantee for the product. 
</P>
<P>
Info World's $4-million Test Center will test and evaluate more than 1,000 
products this year. To earn the seal, products must receive a "satisfactory" 
rating. And note: There is no requirement that the makers advertise their 
products in Info World. 
</P>
<P>
"The seal was not designed to meet the needs of product vendors," said Jonathan 
Sacks, president and publisher of Info World. "It was created to support PC 
buyers all the way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Midnight Spender' 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight Caller," Lorimar Television's moody series about an ex-cop (played by 
Gary Cole) and his radio call-in program, recently started shooting episodes 
for its third season in San Francisco. And that was as good an excuse as any 
for the city's Film and Video Arts Commission to put out a press release 
bragging about the program's effect on the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the production company will spend $12 million, or 
$68,000 each day, on food, lodging, equipment, crew members and extras. That 
includes $13,000 per episode for catering alone. The first of the season's 22 
episodes is set to air Sept. 21 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Variety on TV 
</P>
<P>
First came the switch from straight trade news to big-scale cover stories on 
the likes of Francis Ford Coppola and New York Times theater critic Frank Rich. 
Then came plans for home delivery on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Now the new management at New York-based weekly Variety, cousin of the daily 
entertainment trade paper published here, is laying groundwork for a half-hour 
entertainment news show and maybe even a quiz show using the Variety name. 
</P>
<P>
According to Variety sources, editor Peter Bart, an ex-film executive who took 
charge last year, is talking with producers about pilots for the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Bart declined to comment.

CAMEO FLOUNDERS, FINDS GROOVE, ROCKS THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre was shaping up about as well for Cameo as 
Super Bowl Sundays have for the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Leftenant, one of the veteran funk band's core trio of singers, was out 
sick, leaving the remaining 11 members to face a sea of empty orange chair 
backs in a 2,500-seat hall that looked at least two-thirds empty. Cameo hit the 
stage and spent 20 minutes wandering through a grooveless desert marked by a 
whanging metallic guitar solo, a muscle-bound drum solo, and song snippets too 
meager to establish a firm, funky direction. The singing sounded pretty iffy, 
too. The fans, meanwhile, sat on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, a lot of bands would have decided it was time to turn in a real 
cameo job and hurry through the motions to end the misery. But a band doesn't 
last 13 years, as Cameo has, without having a certain amount of gumption. In a 
fine show of leadership, Cameo's strapping, muscular, Gorgon-haired main man, 
Larry Blackmon, broke the band down to the basic elements of funk -- a 
hammering drum beat and booming bass -- and rallied the fans to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon had come off as something less than sincere early on when he greeted 
the dormant audience by saying: "Thank you for having us, we're enjoying every 
minute of it." Manners count, Larry, but it's obvious that any host who throws 
an under-attended party is going to feel less than ecstatic. In what ought to 
be a great lesson to showmen and politicians everywhere, Blackmon won the fans 
over and jump-started the party by leveling with them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only a few of us in here, but it's as if the whole place is filled, as 
far as we're concerned," he said -- then backed up his words with charging 
energy as he exhorted the crowd with the help of a hard-core beat. With the 
fans up and dancing, Cameo stretched out the number, "Back and Forth," and 
firmly established the long-absent groove. 
</P>
<P>
The elements came together from there. A few more tough funk numbers dug the 
foundation deeper. Then Cameo was free to slow the pace a bit. "She's Strange," 
mysterious yet still funky, was a nice departure. So was a ballad turn by guest 
vocalist William Morris. Morris provided the touch of melismatic pop-soul bel 
canto one doesn't get from Blackmon or his co-vocalist, Tomi Jenkins 
(Blackmon's idiosyncratic nasal twang sounds like a cross between John Lee 
Hooker going "how how how" and Sly Stone drawling into his vocoder). 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the 75-minute show did feature some nice ensemble vocal 
work, as well as many of the catchy little synthesizer hooks that are a Cameo 
trademark. Drummer Buster Marberry's bludgeoning approach was ill-suited to 
some songs that called for subtlety, but he was perfect for the all-out funk of 
the show-closing hits, "Word Up" and "I Want It Now." Aaron Mills' bass thumped 
with such a convincing percussive thud that he might have been shooting mortar 
shells rather than notes, and every man in the lineup showed a willingness to 
embody the funk as well as play it -- especially Charlie Singleton, the lanky, 
rock-oriented guitarist whose black paramilitary garb made him look like a 
deserter from Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation army. 
</P>
<P>
On its records, craftsmanship, rather than inspired songwriting, has made Cameo 
a reliably strong-selling act. This show underscored another attribute that has 
allowed it to keep a high-ranking spot in R &amp; B: a determined work ethic 
and a desire to rock the house under any circumstance. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: SOMETHING TO SAY? BRING IT, AND A 
CHECKBOOK, TO KCEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For $600 an hour, you -- yes, even you -- can have your own radio show. 
</P>
<P>
This is the age when both television and radio are opening their studios to the 
public. From community access television channels to "infomercials," those 
annoying half-hour advertisements on cable television, the airwaves are filled 
with average folks and businesses using the media for their own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Big Brother dictating what the audience will see and hear, little 
sister, the cousin down the street and just about anybody with a product to 
pitch is programming television and radio. Communications experts, the ones who 
sit around at schools and seriously discuss the future, warned us this would 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
The $600-an-hour deal comes from KCEO-AM (1000), a small North County radio 
station that sells air time like a used-car dealership. Weekdays it focuses on 
a business and financial news format. But from 8 a.m. to midnight on weekends, 
and three hours daily during the week, the programming is supplied by people 
willing to pay for the time. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary, but a prime weekend slot costs about $600 an hour. The producers 
can then turn around and sell up to 12 minutes of air time for ads to help 
recoup their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The result is, in some ways, like the block programming of old radio, when 
variety was king and stations didn't have a single-format theme. KCEO's program 
list is a hodgepodge, a potpourri of bizarre subjects and specialized shows. 
Programs cover diabetes, financial planning, thoroughbred racing, the occult 
and nutrition, among other topics. 
</P>
<P>
The system has been in effect for about two years, and has been a good deal for 
KCEO, which is hardly a ratings powerhouse. It provides programming at no cost 
to the station, in addition to guaranteed income. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stuck with it because it's good for us and it's good for people," said 
KCEO sales manager Peter Gray, who acknowledged that, "from a financial 
standpoint, it can be lucrative." 
</P>
<P>
KCEO's programs are different than infomercials because people don't just 
"pitch their wares," Gray said. In addition, independent producers have to 
commit to a minimum of 26 weeks of programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the system can lead to some confusion. When Rick Moore, the 
communications director at San Diego State University received a call from a 
KCEO salesman, he thought he was being asked to appear as a guest on a show. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not clear until he started asking questions that they wanted us to pay 
for the time," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray attributes Moore's confusion to a simple misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to eliminate as many misunderstandings as possible, the Federal 
Communications Commission has established specific guidelines on these types of 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
When any person or company buys time on a radio station, the station must make 
the source of the programming clear to the audience, according to an FCC 
spokesman. The FCC recently fined a station in Pomona for failing to disclose 
that two financial experts had paid for the right to appear on a talk. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said KCEO runs a disclaimer before or after each purchased show: "The 
proceeding (or following) program has been sponsored by . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to let the public know when they are being persuaded and who they 
are being persuaded by," said Roger Holberg, assistant chief of the FCC's 
complaint and investigations branch. "There is no distinction made if it is a 
commercial or programming with some other intent." 
</P>
<P>
I've seen Michael Tuck, and Herb Cawthorne is no Michael Tuck. But he's trying. 
In terms of style, his commentaries for KGTV (Channel 10) are clones of Tuck's 
"Perspectives." He cocks his head toward the camera, uses the harsh language 
and strikes the same tone of righteous indignation that made Tuck the avenging 
angel of the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, though, there has been more style than substance to his commentaries. 
Thursday night he discussed a phone scam, complete with still pictures of 
Cawthorne dialing the number. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne's profound comment: "Is this a rotten, dirty rip-off or what?" 
</P>
<P>
At least in the taped commentaries, he comes across as reasonably articulate, 
and he definitely states his position. Cawthorne's work as an anchor is a 
different story. Used only on the updates that air on the CNN Headline News 
channel, he is almost a parody of an anchor, unsure of when to punch words and 
when to pause. He is stumbling and awkward as he struggles with the 
TelePrompter. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck's anchor seat at Channel 10 is still warm, but KNSD-TV (Channel 39) is 
already promoting Denise Yamada and Marty Levin as "the most consistent anchor 
team" in San Diego. At last week's luncheon to promote its fall season, a solid 
10 on the schmooze-meter, Levin was referred to as the "senior player" in San 
Diego, now that Tuck is gone, and Yamada said that "people come and go, but you 
have got to look at who is staying." Apparently Yamada can be counted among 
those staying, although there were rumors to the contrary. The station 
reportedly picked up an option on her contract earlier this year, and there 
apparently are no plans to make a change. "Marty and Denise are our team," 
station General Manager Neil Derrough said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to XTRA-FM (91X) to use its most loyal listeners as fodder for pranks 
and practical jokes. Last week the station was playing games with callers 
requesting songs, putting some on conference calls with other callers and 
telling others they had the wrong number. The taped calls were then replayed on 
the air. Only 91X would think it logical to play mind games with devoted 
listeners. As if the 91X disc jockeys are not annoying enough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-TV (Channel 8) has filed a complaint against the San Diego police officer 
who climbed on the station's van and put his hand over the camera lens during a 
live broadcast from the site of a plane crash on California 163 last Monday. 
"We're investigating," said SDPD spokesman Bill Robinson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KUSI-TV (Channel 51), which had hoped to have a 10 p.m. newscast on the air by 
Sept. 10, has pushed back the start-up date. They're now shooting for later 
this month. . . . Morning guy Jack Diamond is off the air at KSON-FM (97.3). He 
left to take a job with a Top 40 station in Washington, D.C., his home town. . 
. . Channel 10 couldn't resist blowing its own horn Thursday night, providing 
viewers of the 11 p.m. newscast with exclusive coverage of the station's 6:30 
newscast, a "video post card" to troops overseas. "We've done something special 
here at Channel 10," anchorwoman Carol LeBeau modestly reported. . . . Call it 
counter-programming. KTTV (Channel 11) is airing "Rocky and Bullwinkle" at 11 
a.m., opposite the local news. . . . KFMB-FM (B100) and KFMB-AM (760) are 
trading news people. Pat Gaffey, once a member of the Morning Zoo, is switching 
to the AM; Marilyn Hyder is going to B100.

Goodby Stevie: More than 2,000 musicians and fans stood in blazing Dallas heat 
Friday to pay last respects to Dallas-born, blues-rock guitarist Stevie Ray 
Vaughan, killed Aug. 27 in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"The Texas style of music has lost a great ambassador," said singer Stevie 
Wonder, who attended the funeral service. Several mourners, many wearing black 
hats in memory of Vaughan's style of dress, collapsed because of the heat. 
Singer Bonnie Raitt led a chorus of "Amazing Grace," accompanied by other music 
stars such as Phil Collins and members of the group Z.Z. Top. BETH KLEID

Welcome Jo Yo: Mort Walker will celebrate the 40th anniversary of his comic 
strip "Beetle Bailey" Tuesday by adding a new character to the staff at Camp 
Swampy: Japanese-American Cpl. 
</P>
<P>
Joe (Kashikoi) Yo. The character's middle name means "smart and clever" in 
Japanese. "We felt the time had come to include an Asian-American in our cast," 
Walker said. When the strip premiered on Sept. 4, 1950, the title character in 
"Beetle Bailey" was a goof-off college student; he mistakenly enlisted in the 
Army during the Korean War and has remained in the service ever since. BETH

COUNTERPUNCH: THE PRINT PRESS PAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO TRAPPINGS OF TV NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE FRIEDMAN, Friedman is executive producer of NBC Nightly News With Tom 
Brokaw. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the hotly competitive world of network news, the Persian Gulf crisis is a 
major mobilization of anchors, reporters, producers, camera crews and public 
relations hype. It's a kind of two-front war. One involves the actual coverage. 
The other involves selling that coverage to our brothers and sisters who cover 
television as a beat in the nation's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
At all the networks, the aim is to be first with the best. But, for many who 
write about us, what counts is not what is being said but who gets where and on 
the air first. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who has played the PR game with enthusiasm over the years, I am a 
little amused and frustrated by the turn this particular battle has taken. Most 
of the newspaper coverage of our collective efforts has concentrated on who 
gets where first. Or gets on the air first, even if it's a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the networks aren't blameless in this. It's a vicious cycle that we are 
part of. We lean on our press and publicity people to get the word out on how 
great we are doing or, failing that, how poorly the others are faring. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when the television columns become a time-keeper's score card? ABC 
gets Sam Donaldson into Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night and then rolls 
him out of bed to appear on "Nightline" so it can claim the first report out of 
that country, even though Sam privately complained he'd been on the ground only 
two hours and had nothing original to say. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rather deserves the credit and coverage given him for getting the first 
American one-on-one interview with Saddam Hussein. But many television 
columnists, judging far-off events from home, didn't bother to analyze the 
self-serving answers of the Iraqi leader or question the use of American 
television to make his case. Instead, they told us that Dan didn't have time to 
shave before the interview and that during small talk with Saddam Hussein the 
CBS anchor discussed his favorite pastime, fly fishing. This, after earlier 
columns deploring the evolution of anchors as television personalities first 
and journalists second. 
</P>
<P>
In writing about broadcast journalism's coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis, 
form almost always takes precedence over substance. Almost no credit went to 
NBC's Fred Francis for breaking the story of CIA training of Kuwaiti resistance 
fighters in Saudi Arabia to strike inside occupied Kuwait; David Martin of CBS 
was not interviewed about his scoop on President Bush's decision to send troops 
into Saudi Arabia; no one cared whether ABC's Forrest Sawyer had shaved when he 
reported that Westerners in Iraq were being rounded up. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Bryant Gumbel spent a week doing memorable live reports from inside 
Saudi Arabia for "Today." His work received only fleeting attention on the TV 
pages until "Today's" ratings shot up. This from the columnists who accuse us 
of an obsession with ratings over substance or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of time-keeper, travelogue, ratings-driven coverage in the television 
pages is not unique to the Persian Gulf crisis. It goes on during political 
campaigns, space shuttle explosions, uprisings in Beijing, the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall. Too much attention on the trappings of television news and not 
enough attention on the day-to-day and long-term coverage. In fact, I always 
find it more than a little shocking when television writers will confess they 
really didn't have time to actually watch the programs. They were writing from 
network press releases or spin or hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
That only feeds what is ultimately a form of journalistic cancer: We get so 
caught up in our own press we lose sight of our real role. Newspapers are not 
innocent players. They approach broadcast journalism with a cynical double 
standard. They decry its flamboyance while simultaneously encouraging it. After 
all, writing about anchors and ratings is easier than actually watching and 
listening to the programs these people work so hard to put on. 
</P>
<P>
So, the next time the printsters write about who is doing the best job of 
reporting on TV, look for the what, where and why along with the who and when.

COUNTERPUNCH: WE'LL COVER THE NEWS, LET VIEWERS MAKE THE FINAL CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED TURNER, Turner is executive vice president of news gathering of Cable 
News Network. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minute or two after 6 on the morning of Aug. 28, the now-familiar woman's 
voice from Iraq Television in Baghdad told Will King of the CNN international 
desk in Atlanta that in three hours they would be offering an hour of President 
Saddam Hussein and some French and American "guests." And did CNN think it 
would be carried on its international signal? King pressed the contact on when 
these "guests" were taped but got only what sounded like a second reading of 
the information just given. 
</P>
<P>
I discussed the Iraq TV offering, known internally as "The Uncle Saddy Show," 
with CNN Vice President and Senior Executive Producer Bob Furnad. We agreed to 
recommend carrying it to CNN President Tom Johnson, who concurred, with the 
usual disclaimers presented by anchorman Reid Collins from the Washington 
bureau at the beginning and conclusion of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Why give over an hour's air time on a global television signal to a man 
who has invaded a neighbor, taken tens of thousands prisoner, caused economic 
dislocation and prompted this country's government to commit to risk the lives 
of thousands of men and women? Why does CNN glamorize, elevate, promote and 
dignify this man? 
</P>
<P>
Because it is news. Awful and painful, disgusting and contrived, or insightful 
and significant. It is because it is the first opportunity for a long look at 
American and French hostages. It is news because what this man, Saddam Hussein, 
says and does is, for now, important, perhaps even life-and-death important. No 
one doubts he has the potential to cause war. And, yes, there is the 
fascination one feels in passing a multicar accident along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
More profoundly, one asks, is our society, the global culture, not strong 
enough to see this tape and make independent judgments? Are values so loosely 
in place that they can be dislodged, that by watching this tape men and women 
can have their free will taken from them? We have concluded that while there 
will likely be an emotional erosion of sorts, the point of a free press is to 
present that which is significant and important, qualify that with responsible 
analysis -- the why, the how -- and let viewers of the world make the final 
call. 
</P>
<P>
The technology to present President Saddam will not be disinvented. It's there 
and it will be used. The issue is to what end shall the technology be turned 
and who will control it. 
</P>
<P>
Our place in the wired universe is unique. CNN is the only live (and delayed) 
worldwide television news service. Although our audience is primarily in the 
United States, we have an estimated 10 million viewers in other countries, some 
of them the people who set policy, fix agendas and run governments. We realize 
we are being used. However, this does not necessarily mean we are being 
manipulated. Public figures and those aspiring to become well known have tried 
to use the media since the first newspaper was circulated. Presidents and 
paupers have sought the frenzy of renown. Some receive it for a lifetime, 
others never get their fabled 15 minutes. But, most of the time, we remain 
careful, diligent and vigilant as to the use of the using. 
</P>
<P>
I mention the technology and what it can do; it is also true for the format. 
The game is no longer the same when the dictates of time cease. A 30-minute 
news program may not be a world player. The hardware brings it in, the format 
lets the story unfold. The tale will be told. And it seems to us who work at 
CNN that it is better to provide too much than too little. It is wiser to 
over-inform than under-inform. If misinformation passes across the screen then 
there will be an opportunity to correct and explain, to bring the armies of 
institutional memory to march. Harm can happen. But a great good can occur. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. observers who went to Timisoara to watch the Romanian elections told of a 
guide who said during last winter's collapse of Eastern Europe that the people 
in this town where the revolution began frequently watched CNN as broadcast 
across the border on Yugoslav television and from it drew strength and hope 
that their cause would triumph. It was very nice to hear.

COUNTERPUNCH: HOW DO THE MEDIA HANDLE BEING 'USED'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LEONARD, Leonard was president of CBS News from 1978-82. He is a 
consultant to CBS and director of the Alfred I. du Pont Center for Broadcast 
Journalism at Columbia University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would you buy this? 
</P>
<P>
When a Ted Koppel, Dan Rather or equivalent, engineers an interview with an 
official of a nation with whom we are in conflict, say Iraq, start it this way, 
full screen: 
</P>
<P>
 Warning: According to the U.S. Censor General, the following interview 
contains material that may be injurious to a proper American attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 If you would not go that far, perhaps you wonder whether the media, TV in 
particular, are being used to suit the purposes of the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The short answer is: Of course. Everyone uses the media. Or tries to. Iraq, get 
in line. 
</P>
<P>
The "using" takes dozens of forms, up to and including outright purchase, 
including the cultivation of favored reporters, the granting of interviews, the 
leaking of information, true and false. Make your own list. All good reporters 
know that if they are finding their jobs easy to do and information a cinch to 
get they must be being used. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Iraq, the avenues for favorable media use have been almost as 
restricted as its sea lanes. Its normal channels, none too effective into the 
Western world at best, are pretty well cut off. After sitting for a while on a 
pile of requests from Western journalists of all stripes, apparently it was 
considered advantageous to "use" a limited number of American TV reporters, 
thus trading a little access, strictly controlled, for potential propaganda and 
political rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the invitee jumped at the chance to get to the heart of the 
story after reporting so long from the periphery. TV network news divisions are 
in a perpetual scramble to be first, whether to penetrate the old Iron or the 
new Iraqi Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Whether by choice or accident, the early inside-Iraq field was left to ABC and 
CBS News, with Koppel first off the mark, but Rather shortly on scene and 
remaining nearly a week, not alone, but with a hefty team, nine people in all. 
Out of this came Koppel's initial news-making interview and a scattering of 
solid information from Rather and staff, including the first word of foreigners 
being scattered for possible use as human shields, and climaxed by his hourlong 
interview with the Iraqi dictator, run in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, coverage of a closed society is tricky. Wartime conditions 
heighten the difficulty, and certainly the danger. Sometimes being "used" may 
simply be the only way to go. When that happens, it is essential that the 
viewer be made fully aware of what is, or what may be, going on. If there were 
preconditions to an interview they must be made public. The presence of 
censorship or monitoring should be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The guiding principle is: Trust viewers. Level with them. Let them know what is 
going on behind the scenes. The people who watch the news are just as smart as 
the people who cover the news. Maybe smarter. In this crisis, as far as I have 
been aware, the networks have been careful to spell out the circumstances of 
their access in general terms, but in less detail than I would have felt both 
appropriate and interesting. 
</P>
<P>
A curious new dimension seems gradually to have been added to the ill-defined 
business of "using" the media. A handful of network stars enjoy prestige of 
such a nature that their presence and comment at the scene of a story can 
affect national attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Heads of government know anchors, or at least their names. PR men in every 
embassy in the United States know enough about American TV to tell the home 
office: "If you want to reach Americans, have our man talk to. . . ." Fill in 
your favorite anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Anchors themselves, always on the lookout for a competitive edge, must of 
course be aware that they are the prime target for being used. 
</P>
<P>
Used or not, television, and TV's top news people seem destined to continue to 
play a widening role on the stage of world events. Perhaps that age started on 
Nov. 14, 1977, when Walter Cronkite talked alternately to Egypt's Anwar Sadat 
and Israel's Menachem Begin, out of which came their historic meeting. Anchor 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Will Barbara Walters get George Bush to sit down with Saddam Hussein? 
</P>
<P>
And who will be using whom?

LITTLE LUCIDITY IN WOOSTER GROUP'S 'SAINT ANTONY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just how the New York Wooster Group figures in such an emphatically Pacific Rim 
celebration as the current Los Angeles Festival is not clear, unless you 
attribute its presence to the simple fact that it is a favorite of festival 
director Peter Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
A good reason at that. And the bemused puzzlement that the group leaves us with 
fits right in, because absence of clarity is almost a dedicated pursuit of this 
avant-garde company that trades purposefully in disjointed, carefully 
researched abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 L.A. Festival, the Wooster Group brought us "The Road to 
Immortality, Part Two (. . . Just the High Points)." This year, at the 
Temporary Contemporary, we get "The Road to Immortality, Part Three," otherwise 
called "Frank Dell's the Temptation of Saint Antony." 
</P>
<P>
To explain -- just the high points: Frank Dell was a pseudonym used by comedian 
Lenny Bruce early in his career; "The Temptation of Saint Antony" is Gustave 
Flaubert's offbeat dialectical drama, written and rewritten by him over a 
25-year span (late 1840s to mid-1870s). You may rush out and buy it, but it 
won't help much with the Wooster text, which, by the company's acknowledgement, 
also draws on Flaubert's letters, Ingmar Bergman's movie "The Magician," the 
incidental writings of James Strahs and personal contributions by members of 
this small, artistically insular collective. 
</P>
<P>
The work is so esoteric and choppy, so drawn into itself and the preoccupations 
of the group and its director, Elizabeth LeCompte, that it plays to a 
specialized audience, by now widely composed of the already converted. (The 
performances are reportedly sold out, but you may check for cancellations.) 
</P>
<P>
However, to describe these scenographic constructs and collages much beyond 
content (as in ingredients) and concerns (as in subjective obsessions) is 
fruitless. Like all abstract creations, "St. Antony" will mean different things 
to different people, if it means anything at all. It is the images it delivers 
that stay with us the longest. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the juxtaposition of so-called reality with videotaped segments 
has a nice irony. The people in the videos are mostly nude (how better to get 
attention?) and LeCompte focuses the camera on the sexual differences, 
including a humorous Dance of the Genitals. This is altogether loopy stuff, 
harmless (unless nudity offends you) but satirical, and made funnier since 
Frank Dell (Ron Vawter) does all of the talking. Standing alone at a mike and 
with uncanny precision, he lip-syncs the men on TV as well as the women. (Why 
not? At least one of those women sports a neatly trimmed beard.) 
</P>
<P>
It is this sort of visual/aural shock that the Wooster Group feeds on, and that 
it also delivers in the text. But who would know it? Aside from sheer opacity, 
there is a problem of inaudibility at the Temporary Contemporary (partly 
acoustical and partly due to the intentional whispering or muttering of the 
actors). 
</P>
<P>
Nudity aside, the Wooster Group, along with images, offers a dense theater of 
body language and sound effects: Buzzers, doors that slam open as well as shut, 
phones and aphoristic lines dropped like pebbles in a pond. There are 
references to Tipperary, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Queen of Sheba, "the peace 
to end all peace," Milan ("so modern, so Sforza"), the Taper, Too, and LSD. 
Sometimes you wonder if the whole thing isn't LSD-induced. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly striking videotaped sequence shows people swimming above the 
surface of the water as if they were beneath it. Otherwise, the setting for 
this "St. Antony" is very reminiscent of the one for "Road to Immortality, Part 
Two": lots of exposed technical wizardry, TV monitors, oversized naked bulbs, 
glaring neon tubing and a gridlike stage. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a puppet, a couple of bottomless suitcases and lots of action 
that pulls the members of this band of artists deeper and deeper into their own 
world -- part hallucination and part inside joke. For the record, the ensemble 
includes Vawter, Cynthia Hedstrom, Kate Valk, Peyton Smith, Anna Kohler, 
Michael Stumm, Jeff Webster, Willem Dafoe, Nancy Reilly and Irma St. Paule. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bored," says one of the guys at one point. "I'm a little bored 
too," responds another. Dangerous words, when so much of the time, you can see 
the dots but can't figure out how they connect. 
</P>
<P>
At the Temporary Contemporary, 152 N. Central Ave., tonight and Tuesday, 8 p.m. 
$25; (213) 623-7400 or 480-3232.

GAY POLICE LEAVE THE SHADOWS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMOSEXUAL OFFICERS IN LOS ANGELES ARE HEARTENED BY A LAWSUIT AND PROGRESS IN 
DEPARTMENTS ELSEWHERE. THEY SEEK A MORE OPEN EXISTENCE ON THE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is 24 years old, the son of a cop from the Midwest, and enrolled as a 
recruit at the Los Angeles Police Academy. And because he also happens to be 
homosexual, he lives a double life, masquerading in a hat and dark glasses when 
off duty in the gay community, fearful that his fellow recruits or supervisors 
will stumble upon his true identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these people play rough here," he said, afraid to divulge his name. 
"Something could happen to me. There are people, some hard-core people, who 
would stop at no lengths to get rid of me. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's one thing to handle the court system and street crime, but 
something else to have your own brother officers against you." 
</P>
<P>
She is a six-year veteran officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. And 
because she is a lesbian, she too lives a shadow existence, avoiding the annual 
police picnic and the Christmas party because she can't bring her lover. 
</P>
<P>
"The walls have ears," she said, also shielding her name. "Nothing happens that 
your sergeant and your lieutenant and your captain don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
But while gay Los Angeles police officers fear being discovered, many of their 
counterparts in other major law enforcement agencies in California are open 
about their homosexuality. They are shedding their hidden identities in 
response to decisions by police administrators to recruit gay and lesbian 
officers and to discipline officers who discriminate against their homosexual 
brethren and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
A new survey by a key California police accreditation agency identifies gays 
and lesbians as an untapped group of potential police recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, a professional 
organization of police administrators, last fall rescinded its decades-old 
policy of opposing the hiring of homosexual police officers. "That policy," 
said Phil Lynn, manager of the association's National Law Enforcement Center, 
"was one that no longer reflected the views of our organization." 
</P>
<P>
The exact number of gay and lesbian officers in the Los Angeles Police 
Department is unknown; of 8,400 officers, not one single man or woman is openly 
homosexual, according to police administrators. Local gay activists suggest 
that the number mirrors the city's percentage of homosexual citizens -- perhaps 
as high as 10% -- but police administrators say they know of only a few 
"suspected" gay and lesbian officers. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of their numbers, and after years of working incognito inside 
the department, closeted gay and lesbian officers are growing hopeful because 
of a lawsuit filed by a gay sergeant who contends he was threatened and 
harassed off the force by fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
Gays and lesbians are hoping his suit will change the policies at Parker Center 
to conform with those of other major police agencies in the nation, put an end 
to alleged discrimination by heterosexual officers of their homosexual 
counterparts and, perhaps most important, launch new police recruitment drives 
aimed at the city's gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists believe that if the police hire more people from within their 
community, relations with police could improve and, likewise, make many 
heterosexual officers sensitive to problems in the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexual officers are hoping that they need no longer work publicly in a 
dark-blue police uniform while living private lives in a cloak of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to happen," vowed Mitchell Grobeson, the former Los Angeles police 
sergeant who brought the suit. "It has to happen. Otherwise, the number of 
lawsuits will be so exorbitant to the city of Los Angeles that it will be too 
costly for the department not to." 
</P>
<P>
In an environment that demands loyalty, gay officers see Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates as their foe. And the chief made it clear in a recent interview that 
while he will not tolerate harassment among his troops, he also will not 
compromise on the issue of selectively recruiting gay and lesbian officers. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gates, the department does not specifically exclude homosexuals from 
among its ranks. But the department also does not actively target gays and 
lesbians for recruitment, as it does other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"In the factors that go into being a police officer," the chief said, "sexual 
preference is irrelevant. It should stay irrelevant. And it will stay 
irrelevant while I have anything to say about it. I guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sgt. Ed Mautz, a longtime recruitment officer, said the department only 
once in the last decade actually tried to attract homosexuals to the force, 
when it set up a recruitment booth at the Gay Pride parade. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one person came up and asked us about our recruitment program," he said. 
"Now, granted, this was seven years ago and attitudes may have changed by now. 
But we got no response at all from gays or lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the only people who did come up to talk to us were punk rockers with 
spiked hair and steel boots, and they just came up to laugh at us." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Los Angeles department's refusal to recruit homosexuals, other 
large police departments in California and around the nation are actively 
seeking gay and lesbian officers to fill their police academies, and they are 
demonstrating to their local homosexual communities that the police are 
sensitive to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, for instance, advertises for 
recruits in gay publications and sets up recruitment booths during large public 
events in the gay community. Capt. Rachel Burgess of the sheriff's West 
Hollywood station said her deputies are also well aware of an automatic 
three-day suspension for any officer making a derogatory statement about 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are gays or lesbians," she said, "the doors are not going to be closed 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department, 20% of the sworn work force 
is gay or lesbian, a lesbian lieutenant supervises a 70-officer bailiff 
security office, several gay sergeants are watch commanders, and the 
department's budget officer is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, according to Ray Towbis, an aide to the sheriff, the president 
of the local Deputy Sheriffs Assn. was a sergeant who also happened to be gay. 
"He was voted in by everybody," Towbis said. 
</P>
<P>
In traditionally conservative San Diego, Police Chief Bob Burgreen has assigned 
an officer to work as a special liaison with the homosexual community in the 
city's Hillcrest district, where the department earlier this year conducted a 
police job fair. 
</P>
<P>
"People in our command are aware that we don't play this bull of screening out 
gays or lesbians," said Matt Weathersby, the San Diego liaison officer. "We are 
going to get more gay officers." 
</P>
<P>
Added one San Diego gay police officer, who is considering dashing his secret 
identity to become the first openly homosexual officer there: "The Police 
Department has taken on some new policies and training methods to help us. And 
the people are very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
A statewide study in June by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and 
Training in Sacramento, which certifies police officers, identified the 
homosexual community as a key target area for future officers, if police 
agencies in the 1990s hope to bolster their sagging recruitment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The study said that gay officers are often more stable and less transient than 
heterosexual officers, and that a single man does not need the salary that a 
married man with children requires. The study also questioned the wisdom of 
perpetrating the macho image of the big-city officer. 
</P>
<P>
"The stiff upper lip macho mentality characteristic of the average police 
officer collapses under too much stress," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the macho image carried by many police officers into their work 
tends to have a negative impact on the average citizen. This leads to distrust 
of police departments in general and, as in Los Angeles, into citizen 
reluctance to increase police department budgets when (the issue) appears on 
the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
A Golden State Peace Officers Assn., run for and by gay and lesbian officers, 
has been established, and emissaries like Richard Norton, a co-founder and San 
Francisco County sheriff's deputy, travel the state teaching local departments 
the value of extending their ranks into the local gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Gay Officers Action League was set up in New York City to foster 
the same camaraderie among homosexual police officers on the East Coast. 
Executive Director Sam Ciccone said the group helps sponsor recruitment drives 
in the gay community, and helped persuade the New York Police Department to 
print recruitment posters picturing gay and lesbian officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent them throughout the city," he said. "Why? Because police departments 
reflect the areas they serve, and I think that the people in New York want to 
have a police department that is really responsive to them." 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, a lesbian recruit named Mica England is suing the Dallas Police 
Department, alleging she was disqualified because of her sexual orientation. 
She hopes to overturn a state law that classifies sexual intercourse with a 
member of the same sex as deviant -- the biggest stumbling block for homosexual 
police recruits in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad and angry," said the 26-year-old England, describing how she was 
turned down as unfit to work for Dallas' finest. "On my way out, I yanked down 
the equal-opportunity employment poster from their bulletin board." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Lindsay, head of the litigation division for Dallas, declined to discuss 
the city's defense against the lawsuit, except to say: "There are legitimate 
reasons for not hiring people who are lesbians or gay for law enforcement 
postions." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas case is similar to what is happening in Los Angeles, where a bloc of 
City Council members wants to settle Grobeson's lawsuit. But what the former 
police sergeant wants most of all is the creation of a special position in Los 
Angeles for an officer to work as a liaison with the gay and lesbian community, 
and for the department to actively recruit future officers from within that 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Without those changes, Grobeson and others contend, the Police Department will 
continue to foster harassment and discrimination of gay and lesbian officers. 
They complain that the department looks the other way in condoning pranks, 
name-calling and threats against homosexual officers, and that some patrolmen 
even refuse to work with or provide backup to officers suspected of being gay. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles police officer, whose lesbianism was suspected by her peers, 
recalled an incident several years ago when she chased a burglary suspect alone 
on foot for 15 minutes, without backup from her partner. "It was like a slap in 
the face," she said. "I was terrified." 
</P>
<P>
And Grobeson described how a fellow officer once told him how he would like to 
strand a suspected gay policeman inside a vacant building during a false-alarm 
call. Grobeson said the officer boasted: "I'm going to sneak up behind him and 
I'm going to blow off the back of his head. Then I'm going to claim it was dark 
and that I thought he was the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
The incident never occurred, but Grobeson said it was an example of the 
hostility some officers harbor toward gays in their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexual officers said the discrimination begins as early as the background 
investigation into new recruits, when all applicants are asked pointed 
questions about their private lifestyles, their closest friends and their past 
and present romances. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many gay activists accuse the top police managers in Los Angeles of 
being prejudiced for refusing to recruit and welcome gays and lesbians into the 
rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to drag him (Chief Gates) kicking and screaming to go 
along with change," said Donna Wade, co-chair of the Los Angeles-based Gay and 
Lesbian Police Advisory Task Force, and herself a former police officer in St. 
Louis and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Gates has a very homophobic attitude," added Miki Jackson of the task force. 
"He has an attitude that is very dated. He is creating an atmosphere that is 
allowing job harassment in the job place." 
</P>
<P>
Gates today declines to discuss his personal views on homosexuality, but in a 
1982 interview with The Times, he quipped: "Who'd want to work with one?" 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Gates would only go so far as to say: "We have 
homosexuals in the Police Department, and what my personal views are have 
nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that while federal law requires police departments to 
recruit racial minorities and women, the same does not hold true for gays and 
lesbians. "What you do in your bedroom, what your sexual preference is, is none 
of my business," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is so private, and I think it would be absolutely ridiculous and wrong to 
try and go out and recruit people based on their sexual preference." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he strongly discourages harassment within his police ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have some mavericks out there," he said. "But I don't allow anybody to 
harass a Los Angeles police officer. I don't let them do that. I won't allow 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"We have women in this department. You think they haven't been harassed? Well, 
we deal with that harassment." 
</P>
<P>
Several patrolmen interviewed at random said they would not object to working 
alongside a homosexual officer, as long as that officer is professional and 
conscientious. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the department is ready," said one officer, a sergeant with 
about 20 years in the department. "No more than private industry would want to 
hire so many gays. What is the need to?" 
</P>
<P>
But others disagree, particularly gay and lesbian peace officers with other law 
enforcement agencies who feel secure enough in their jobs that they have openly 
revealed their homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Said James Simms, a five-year veteran of the California Department of 
Corrections who now works at the R.J. Donovan prison in San Diego County: 
</P>
<P>
"I could hold my personnel file up to almost any heterosexual officer. I come 
to work on time, always properly dressed. I'm courteous and my file reflects 
that. I've got over five letters of commendation. 
</P>
<P>
"And other gay officers can do the same. We're just as good as anybody else."

COLLAPSED HALL HAD NO PEER REVIEW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-year-old problem-ridden music complex at Cal State Long Beach was built 
during a period when California State University did not require an independent 
review of building plans for possible design flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The $6.3-million complex was one of scores of projects erected on Cal State 
campuses statewide during the 1970s and early 1980s that were authorized by the 
university system without being scrutinized by independent structural 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as a matter of policy, Cal State relied on architects and engineers of 
projects to detect and correct their own mistakes -- a practice that is 
commonly frowned upon by the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows yet whether such a review would have prevented the July 2 collapse 
of the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall and apparent structural problems in 13 
other buildings within the complex. As students prepare to return to classes on 
Tuesday, investigators are still analyzing debris and searching for a cause for 
the 120-ton roof cave-in. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing the best we can to make sure that nothing else like this 
happens," said Pete Anderson, an investigator for an engineering firm hired by 
Cal State to find the cause. 
</P>
<P>
While state law does not mandate independent reviews of university building 
plans, University of California officials say they have routinely required them 
on their campuses as a safety precaution. Cities and counties also have 
commonly relied on so-called plan checks to ensure that new structures -- from 
private homes to high-rise offices -- meet local and state building codes. 
</P>
<P>
"You need peer review," said Larry Guthrie, chief of architecture and 
engineering for the Office of the State Architect, which under state law must 
review building plans for community colleges and elementary and secondary 
schools but not universities. "We are all human, and everybody makes mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
In a major policy shift, Cal State started checking building plans five years 
ago at the urging of a new assistant vice chancellor who had previously worked 
for San Diego County, where such reviews are mandatory. Although there are no 
indications of widespread structural problems on Cal State campuses statewide, 
the policy was changed as a safeguard. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Cal State Vice Chancellor Dale Hanner said the policy 
change has "significantly reduced the chance of mistake and thereby costly 
corrections to be made" to new buildings throughout the Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
Hanner said, however, that it would be premature to comment on whether an 
independent review of plans a decade ago would have prevented the recital hall 
collapse. The contributing factors leading to the collapse will be answered as 
part of the investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the architect of the sprawling three-acre music complex and engineers 
involved in the investigation said an independent review might have made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"If those buildings had been built today, it could be a completely different 
story," said investigator Lynn Bockemohle of Englekirk &amp; Hart Consulting 
Engineers, the firm hired by Cal State. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Donald Gibbs said his firm depended on structural engineer Don Erb to 
check his own structural calculations for the complex. Erb, citing the advice 
of his attorney, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is perfect," Gibbs said. "Every time something is looked at, there are 
chances that imperfections will be picked up." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators with Englekirk &amp; Hart said a preliminary review of the 
20-building complex identified a number of building code violations in many 
structures -- some of which, the investigators said, would have been easily 
detected during a preconstruction plan review. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a civil engineer for the firm, said they will likely recommend that 
at least half of the music complex buildings be reinforced or altered to make 
up for deficiencies in the original design and construction. In some cases, he 
said, plans called for studs -- the structural supports in walls -- that were 
too narrow to meet seismic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there was something that was wrong here that got by whoever was 
looking at it before," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Esgate, president of San Diego-based Esgil Corp., the firm now 
contracted by Cal State to review all building plans, said Cal State officials 
turned to his company five years ago because "an awful lot of plans were coming 
in with significant change orders," meaning corrections were being made by 
builders during construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We catch many serious errors on plans, and I am not just talking about CSU," 
said Esgate, whose firm also checks plans for 60 cities and counties. "Quite 
often we get plans in here that are just not adequate for construction. Yet 
(designers) are forced to complete them and meet their schedules. It is really 
important that there is an independent review." 
</P>
<P>
Hanner, the vice chancellor, said Cal State began requiring plan checks in 1985 
because the "volume and complexities" of the system's building program were 
increasing and officials wanted a higher level of control. In 1984, for 
example, there were $13 million worth of projects under construction and $25 
million in design stages systemwide. This year, by contrast, $350 million worth 
of projects are being built and $650 million are being designed. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the July 2 collapse, Cal State instructed campus officials 
statewide to inspect buildings with the same design, architect or general 
contractor as the recital hall. Any further review of campus buildings, Cal 
State officials said, would occur only if it were recommended in the final 
Englekirk &amp; Hart report, which is expected later this month. 
</P>
<P>
While Cal State officials defend that approach, an official with the Office of 
the State Architect said the university system should be treating the incident 
as seriously as a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be re-evaluating their whole building program," said Patrick 
Campbell, chief of structural safety for the state architect. "Each earthquake 
or failure should trigger that kind of reaction. . . . They should go back and 
look at what buildings they have and go over the plans and see if possibly 
there are some other problems." 
</P>
<P>
But Cal State officials cautioned against overreaction, saying it was not 
necessary to re-examine every structure. Sheila Chaffin, the former Cal State 
assistant vice chancellor who pushed for plan checks, said the shift in policy 
in 1985 should not be interpreted as an indictment of buildings constructed 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean what was built before has poor design or sloppy work," Chaffin 
said. "The key is there haven't been mass collapses or terrible problems. . . . 
I wouldn't draw the conclusion that there should be alarm." 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of Cal State campuses statewide confirmed that, aside from 
those associated with major earthquakes, no major structural problems have been 
reported with buildings erected during the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Many campus officials, nonetheless, said they have greater confidence in the 
safety and dependability of buildings that underwent plan review than those 
buildings that did not. 
</P>
<P>
Several campus officials speculated that plan checks might have helped avoid 
minor problems with some buildings, ranging from an inadequate air-conditioning 
system at Cal State Northridge to ventilation problems at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Office of the State Architect officials said they routinely reviewed Cal State 
building plans through the 1960s, before reorganizations of both the university 
system and the state architect's office shifted responsibility to the 
chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cal State is required to submit building plans to the state architect 
only to ensure compliance with state codes on access for the handicapped. The 
plans must also be reviewed by the state fire marshal for fire code compliance, 
but no other state review is required. 
</P>
<P>
That may change, however, because of concerns about the structural safety of 
state-owned buildings that have been raised as a result of last fall's Loma 
Prieta earthquake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
A board of inquiry recommended to Gov. George Deukmejian in May that an 
independent state agency act as the "local building department" for all new 
state buildings in order to ensure higher levels of seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about earthquake safety has been high in the minds of those 
investigating the Cal State Long Beach music complex. University officials 
closed five music complex buildings last month because of fears that they may 
not be able to withstand an earthquake, and identified six others that 
investigators said need remedial action if they are to remain open "for any 
long-term continued use." Since then, two of the five buildings have been 
reopened while they await repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, all 20 music complex buildings passed earthquake safety checks after 
the Whittier and Loma Prieta temblors, and also received favorable reviews in 
routine visual maintenance inspections. 
</P>
<P>
The complex got near-perfect marks in maintenance inspections over the last 
several years, although in January the buildings for the first time received a 
grade less than satisfactory. University officials have not been able to find 
the complete January inspection report, but a summary page reveals that the 
roof received a rating of four out of a possible seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Charmack, Cal State Long Beach director of facilities management and 
physical planning, said the low rating was due to problems with leaky roofs. He 
said the university had budgeted $53,000 this year for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators with Englekirk &amp; Hart said they are looking into the 
possibility that rain had so severely damaged the wood and metal trusses in the 
recital hall -- the primary structural component of the roof -- that they 
weakened and eventually gave out. Segments of the trusses have been sent to 
testing laboratories for analysis, including a test to determine if they were 
manufactured with a structural flaw. 
</P>
<P>
They are also exploring the possibility that the roof collapsed because too 
much concrete was used in its construction. Plans call for a three-inch layer 
of concrete atop a plywood sheet, but investigators said preliminary checks 
show that in some areas the concrete was thicker than specified. 
</P>
<P>
Segments of the roof have been sent to testing labs to determine how widespread 
the problem was and whether the additional weight could have caused the 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cal State officials have been unable to locate the inspector for the 
project who was responsible for overseeing on-site construction. They said an 
index card kept by the chancellor's office on the music complex identified the 
inspector as Clyde Jones, but no other information was available. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the music complex marked the first time a private on-site 
inspector was used by the Cal State system under an arrangement beginning in 
1980 that permitted the hiring of inspectors outside the Office of the State 
Architect, said Campbell, the office's structural safety chief. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from Shirley Bros. Inc., the Pasadena general contractor that built 
the music complex, refused requests to be interviewed. The company also refused 
to make construction records available. 
</P>
<P>
Construction records were also unavailable from Cal State. A spokeswoman for 
Cal State Long Beach said university officials "turned this place upside down" 
looking for copies of the records, but could not find them. Officials from the 
Cal State system, which is officially responsible for maintaining such records, 
said they are destroyed after five years. 
</P>
<P>
"This institution is 40 years old, and this is the first building failure we 
had," said Charmack. "I am not sure it is reasonable to keep records all the 
way back." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The various warranties are hardly over with after five years," said Guthrie of 
the Office of the State Architect, which keeps construction records 
indefinitely. "We have lawsuits that have gone on for 15 or 20 years."

GRIM ECONOMIC SCENARIOS DRAWN FROM CRISIS IN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: ALL-OUT ACTION COULD FORCE U.S. ONTO A WARTIME FOOTING AND SLASH 
LIVING STANDARDS, EXPERTS SAY.

<P>
If the United States embarks on an all-out war in the Middle East, it could 
have enormous economic consequences, potentially inflicting more damage on the 
U.S. and world economies than anything since World War II, government and 
private economists say. 
</P>
<P>
Scenarios compiled by leading economic forecasting firms show that a major 
Persian Gulf-wide military action potentially could force the United States 
onto a wartime economic footing and slash living standards throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever benefit we get in the short run, we will lose in the long-term harm 
that we are doing," contends Allen Sinai, economist for Boston Co., a New 
York-based economic consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Perkins, an analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., economic 
forecasting company, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, short of the world wars, there's been the kind of economic 
impact a war in the Middle East could have," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is important because while actual armed conflict often has 
accomplished its political objectives, the economic impact of launching and 
sustaining a huge military effort frequently has proved to be an economic 
turning-point. 
</P>
<P>
Economists generally agree that it was World War II, not the Roosevelt 
Administration's New Deal programs, that ultimately pulled the United States 
out of the Great Depression of the late 1930s and established this country as 
the world's foremost economic power. 
</P>
<P>
Government borrowing needed to finance both the $200-billion cost of the 
Vietnam War and the Johnson Administration's Great Society programs is widely 
blamed for having been a major force behind the rocketing inflation and severe 
recession of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But economists say that for all its disadvantages, embarking on an all-out war 
-- with a quick and presumably decisive victory -- could prove a far better 
option than other alternatives, such as a protracted impasse, which would 
rapidly drain the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts warn that a lengthy stalemate, with continuing uncertainty over the 
availability of global oil supplies, would spur oil prices sharply higher and 
push the economies of the United States and other major industrial nations into 
a certain recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East has well over half the world's oil reserves; few regions have 
such a hold on global economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
When oil prices rise by only $6 -- about half the increase they showed in the 
first three weeks of the current gulf crisis -- they add a full 
percentage-point to the inflation rate, and dampen the world's economic growth 
by 0.5%, Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak says. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three widely differing scenarios, along with forecasters' predictions 
on what would happen economically under each of them: 
</P>
<P>
* The quick victory: 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq provokes a U.S. attack. U.S. bombardment and amphibious assaults knock 
out Saddam Hussein's army within a few weeks, before his tanks and missiles can 
damage Saudi and Kuwaiti oil fields. Oil prices rise briefly to near $50 a 
barrel, but plunge to $20 as the fighting ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the conflict would be costly, and even a short war could increase the 
already outsized-budget deficit by $15 billion or more, the United States would 
not have to go to a wartime footing, impose rationing or suffer severe 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over Iraqi strongman Hussein also might help keep oil prices 
significantly lower than they otherwise would have been -- possibly for several 
years, David D. Hale, an economist with Kemper Financial Services Inc. in 
Chicago, contends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most benign" of the various scenarios "because you get this thing 
resolved," Hale says. 
</P>
<P>
But others contend that the situation would not be so simple, particularly if 
war left the Middle East so unstable that the United States were forced to 
maintain a large number of troops in the region. They say military spending 
could continue to drag down economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
* The sustained battle: 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting begins, but continues for several months. Iraq destroys the huge 
Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia, and U.S. and Iraqi ground forces engage in a 
long, bloody struggle in the Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
 A prolonged war, or one that destroys major oil fields, would leave supplies 
disrupted for months, or even years. Fuel would be in short supply. Shortages 
could appear in other products as well. 
</P>
<P>
The war could cost a quarter of a billion dollars a day -- much more by some 
estimates -- sending the U.S. government on a borrowing spree. Oil prices would 
soar, and stay high even after the conflict, particularly if production 
facilities were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in military spending would buoy heavy industry and 
high-technology outfits, but would not provide the kind of major boost to 
overall economic activity that earlier conflicts, such as World War II, did. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some analysts argue that the buildup would only deflect investment from 
where it is most needed -- education, infrastructure and research and 
development that makes U.S. industries more competitive with those of other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
While factories might hum, their output would not be contributing to a better 
life for most Americans. "You can't consume tanks," Perkins points out. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai agrees. "Whatever benefit we get in the short run, we will lose in the 
long-term harm that we are doing," he contends. "It helps (gross national 
product, the benchmark of immediate economic vigor), but it doesn't help our 
long-run, competitive problems." 
</P>
<P>
Those who lived through World War II remember it as a time of deprivation. 
Women drew lines for stocking seams on the backs of their legs, because silk, 
once used to manufacture the hosiery, had to be used for parachutes. Butter was 
replaced by dyed lard. Gasoline, sugar and meat were rationed. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects such drastic measures in the event of war in the Middle East, 
but a long war -- or one that destroyed major oil fields -- would seriously 
crimp consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline lines could return if Saudi, Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies were 
interrupted for a long time. Higher fuel prices, possibly as much as 50 cents a 
gallon over pre-conflict levels, would discourage many American families from 
taking long driving vacations. 
</P>
<P>
The only economic winners would be U.S. oil producers, and the economies of 
such states as Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
* The prolonged impasse: 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 U.S. troops face Iraq's million-man army in a standoff that 
continues for months. The best hope is that the international embargo will 
eventually force Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, but that will take at 
least another half-year, and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
 All bets would be off as the nation hunkers down and shifts to a wartime 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
The higher oil prices initially would be felt by airlines and trucking firms, 
but the impact would spread quickly throughout the economy. Within months, the 
cost of making everything from aluminum to toiletries would rise. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumers would cut back sharply on spending and borrowing, 
forcing some firms, mainly those without much potential for defense work, into 
a slump. Even healthy companies would find it harder to keep their businesses 
going. 
</P>
<P>
While neither the higher prices nor the economic slump would amount to an 
outright economic disaster, the prolonged uncertainty "guarantees that we are 
going to be smack dab in the middle of stagflation," the double wallop of 
economic stagnation and inflation, Perkins contends. 
</P>
<P>
Further, managing these problems would be made more difficult because the gulf 
crisis has been imposed on an already weakening U.S. economy -- and a shaky 
U.S. financial system -- leaving top economic policy-makers with virtually no 
leeway in dealing with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The federal budget deficit, already spinning out of control, would mushroom to 
historic highs of as much as $300 billion. Operation Desert Shield already is 
expected to cost the government $2.5 billion by the end of September -- about 
double what the Pentagon had earlier estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a continuing commitment on that scale, the President and Congress would 
have lost their best options for bringing the budget into better balance. They 
could not cut military spending. Nor would voters who are feeling the bite of 
higher oil prices likely be willing to agree to higher taxes -- particularly on 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Besides military outlays, spending for welfare benefits, unemployment insurance 
and other transfer payments would rise sharply. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board also would have its hands tied. The higher oil prices 
and the need to keep the dollar strong so Washington can sustain its military 
operations would force the central bank to keep interest rates high. 
</P>
<P>
That would be enough to sink many of the debt-laden businesses that had 
propelled themselves with junk bonds during the 1980s. Also high on the 
casualty list would be some of the shakier savings and loan associations that 
had managed to survive until now. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the crisis "could not have come at a worse time for the U.S. 
economy," Perkins says. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most difficult factors for economists to predict is what effect the 
Mideast crisis may have on public psychology. If consumers panic, as they did 
in 1974, a relatively small oil shortfall could spawn severe shortages and send 
the economy into a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Although most such conflicts prompt consumers to cut back, the outbreak of the 
Korean War in 1950, which came when memories of wartime rationing were still 
fresh, produced the biggest surge of consumer spending in history. 
</P>
<P>
But from initial indications, the Mideast crisis appears to be having the 
opposite effect -- dampening consumer confidence and leading some forecasters 
to predict a slowdown in sales of automobiles and homes.

SCIENTISTS, INDIANS BATTLE OVER SKELETONS, ARTIFACTS; 
</P>
<P>
HERITAGE: EFFORTS TO RETURN THE REMAINS TO DESCENDANTS CREATE CONFLICTS WITH 
RESEARCH PROJECTS.

Phillip Walker, anthropologist and great-grandson of an American Indian, is a 
troubled man. 
</P>
<P>
For years the UC Santa Barbara professor has been studying the birth defect 
spina bifida. The specific objects of his research have been remains of the 
prehistoric Indians of the Channel Islands, where the condition was common. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the bones of the 1,000-year-old victims, Walker says, gives him 
clues about the environmental and genetic causes of spina bifida. That in turn 
might help the living. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker might not be able to complete his study because the bones may be 
gone, the subject of a growing national movement to return Indians' remains and 
sacred artifacts to their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
"If there aren't any remains, then I won't be able to see what the distribution 
of those conditions were, and what environmental and genetic factors explain 
it," said Walker, whose Potawatomi ancestry influenced his choice of vocations. 
"I feel I've been working for Native Americans." 
</P>
<P>
But Indians and their advocates say reburial, which they refer to as 
"repatriation," represents a long-overdue way to recognize Indians as human 
beings and restore dignity to a people whose spiritual beliefs have been 
trampled on. 
</P>
<P>
Laws in more than 30 states already protect American Indian graves and require 
negotiations with living Indians if bones and related artifacts are unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
Under a bill passed by the California Legislature and sent to the governor 
Friday, a complete inventory of Indian remains must be undertaken and 
descendants must be notified of the existence of the bones. The descendants 
would be entitled to take possession of the bones for reburial. The University 
of California, which has a collection of more than 1 million bones -- many of 
them out of the ground for decades -- vigorously opposed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation pending in Congress would compel museum curators to inventory their 
archeological holdings, then deal with the tribes most closely affiliated with 
the deceased. Only successful negotiations with the living Indians, or proof 
that the bones and grave artifacts were obtained with tribal permission, would 
entitle the institutions to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law passed last year has already commanded the Smithsonian 
Institution to inventory its collection of some 30,000 skeletal remains, of 
which an estimated 18,500 are those of American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Members of many of the 400 recognized tribes, which include an estimated 1.5 
million people, believe the souls of the dead cannot rest if their graves are 
disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you disturb the dead, then it disturbs their spirit and causes it to become 
restless and wander and interferes with its residence in the spirit world or 
afterlife," said Walter Echo-Hawk, an attorney for the Native American Rights 
Fund in Boulder, Colo. "It can also bring harm or evil upon the relatives of 
that dead person." 
</P>
<P>
He says it's a matter of racial discrimination as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, society guarantees that everybody gets buried, whether they are 
paupers, strangers or unclaimed remains," he said. "That's the mark of a 
civilized country. And the American Indian dead are just as entitled to a 
decent burial as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"To see our dead bandied about in museum showcases or tourist attractions along 
with dinosaurs or snails -- it sends a signal to Indian people and society at 
large that we're not quite human, that we're somehow different, and it's OK to 
subject us to that kind of treatment when no one would tolerate that for 
anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, however, fear that repatriation means permanent reburial. They 
liken the movement to book-burning and say it could destroy the best surviving 
evidence of preliterate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Bones, they say, reveal ancient people's diets, diseases, causes of death, 
activities, environment and cultural evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been seen as a conflict between sacred Indians and evil scientists," 
said Clement Meighan, a UCLA archeologist who chairs the American Committee for 
the Preservation of Archeological Collections. "But the real story is about a 
loss of cultural resources to the national heritage, to the Indians, and the 
throwing away of something that can never be regained. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years from now everybody is going to look back and say: 'How could these 
people have been so stupid? They squandered the birds, the trees, the water and 
all their cultural heritage at the same time. They threw it all away.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bones can be profitably restudied as science changes, the academics say. For 
example, advances in tracing DNA from ancient bones could tell about the 
evolution of disease and migration. 
</P>
<P>
Remains can also dispel historical falsehoods, according to Walker. He cites 
the dispute over whether Father Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who founded 
California's 18th-Century missions, should be declared a saint. 
</P>
<P>
Serra is accused by Indian activists of mistreating Indians, while Roman 
Catholic advocates portray him as one who brought enlightenment. Walker said 
studies on mission Indians' remains appear to challenge the record left by 
missionaries, whose journals said the Indians ate well. 
</P>
<P>
"But analysis of the skeletal remains indicates their growth was stunted and 
they had a lot of health-related problems that could be nutritionally related," 
Walker said. "So here's an example of how this kind of research can dispel the 
myths propagated by the dominant society to minimize their guilt about what 
happened to Native Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist Keith Kintigh of Arizona State University said grave artifacts 
can prove Indians were not "primitive." 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate jewelry and pottery buried with some Indians indicate "extremely 
complex societies with very strong leadership" and hierarchies, Kintigh said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of repatriation are not impressed. They think collections of Indian 
remains are stolen property, their possession by whites a form of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at 500 years of what's happened to Indians, and you can't take that 
reburial issue out of those 500 years and say that a particular practice is not 
racist," said Vine DeLoria Jr., a University of Colorado Indian studies 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
He is equally unmoved by the fact that the study and display of the corpses, 
bones and artifacts of other groups, such as ancient Egyptians, arouses no 
controversy among their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
"If you all want to do that to your ancestors, that's fine with us," DeLoria 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of archeology is pure fantasy," DeLoria continued. "They dig in these 
ruins and classify Indian societies according to the kinds of pottery they 
have, and then make up all these incredible stories about what they've learned 
from it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you can go to the dump and look at layers of Pepsi and then layers of Coke 
bottles. What would you say? The Coke people invaded and took over the Pepsi 
people? It's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
American Indian groups have been assertive on the issue for years. Kintigh and 
DeLoria both attribute the present willingness to listen to a new generation of 
scientists, educated in the 1960s and sensitive to minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
David Hunt, administrator of the Smithsonian's anthropological collection, said 
the trend is catching on elsewhere. In Australia, for example, aboriginal 
populations have requested the return of skeletal remains. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, after years of negotiations with Indian leaders, Congress created 
the National Museum of the American Indian. To be built in Washington, D.C., it 
is to include the Smithsonian's vast collection of Indian materials. But the 
law that created the museum also mandated that the Smithsonian inventory its 
skeletons, which could reduce its holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Many states -- including California, Nebraska, Arizona and Oregon -- have 
adopted laws protecting Indian grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was prompted partly by open disrespect for Indian remains, 
often by "pothunters" who excavate for fun and profit. 
</P>
<P>
In one well-known case in the 1930s in Salina, Kan., a farmer dug up an Indian 
cemetery on his property and created a tourist attraction which he advertised 
on billboards. For $3.50 a visitor could view the skeletons of 160 men, women 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
The remains were finally reburied this year after the Native American Rights 
Fund lobbied successfully on behalf of three descendant Midwestern tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most offensive to Indians are remains in the Smithsonian and elsewhere 
that were collected for the late 19th-Century Indian Crania Study. The study, 
later debunked, was sponsored by the federal government during the Indian Wars. 
Scientists of the time considered it possible to evaluate intelligence and 
morals by measuring skulls. 
</P>
<P>
"They decapitated slain warriors on the battlefield and had their heads 
delivered to the Army Medical Museum," Echo-Hawk said. Not surprisingly, he 
said, the scientists found Indians to be inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists tend to view the reburial legislation as political interference in 
academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Meighan of UCLA said: "Sappy politicians love (the reburial movement) because 
it makes them look like they're pro-minority. And it doesn't cost anything -- 
which is not true, but that's their opinion -- so they won't have to put up any 
money for real problems such as education and housing." 
</P>
<P>
Bills in the U.S. House and Senate would ban the sale of grave artifacts, human 
remains and sacred ceremonial objects without the consent of heirs or tribal 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Museums, universities and historical societies would face losing federal 
funding, which many depend on. Curators would have the burden of contacting 
Indian groups or heirs, and an advisory panel of Indians and scientists would 
be established to mediate disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill passed the Select Committee on Indian Affairs on Aug. 1. It is 
sponsored by Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman 
and vice chairman, respectively, of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs is scheduled to vote in 
September on a bill sponsored by its chairman, Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.). 
Steven Heeley, deputy director of the Senate committee's minority staff, said 
both measures appear to have wide support. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), passed the 
Assembly by a 47-17 vote in June and passed the Senate on a 23-5 vote Friday. 
The University of California argued that the bones in its Lowie Museum at UC 
Berkeley, the third largest such collection in the country, are so old that it 
would be difficult to determine which tribe they belong to. Last month, a 
special UC panel recommended that bones be returned only to descendants whose 
biological or cultural ties can be proven, a criteria that would be very 
difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Some Indians and academics have managed to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
State museums in Arizona and New Mexico have worked out arrangements with 
Indian groups in which sacred objects remain displayed but are temporarily 
returned to the tribe for important religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, a specially built crypt contains 4,000 bones that were washed from 
their graves during floods in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Dedicated in 1988 and sealed with boulders, it will be reopened every five 
years to allow the placement of more remains and to admit carefully screened 
researchers. The local Paiute tribe and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must 
approve research on the bones, believed to be between 2,000 and 3,000 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribe selected a medicine man to purify the crypt and all the 
archeologists involved and members of the tribe who helped put the boxes in the 
crypt," said Amy Dansie, collection curator for the Nevada State Museum. "The 
tribe is satisfied that their ancestors are buried in Mother Earth . . . and 
the remains are not lost to science."

PARTISAN BATTLE LOOMS OVER NEW CONGRESSIONAL SEATS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO GAIN SEVEN MORE HOUSE MEMBERS AS A RESULT 
OF THE 1990 CENSUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
California's two major political parties are gearing up for a bitter -- and 
most likely protracted -- conflict over how to divvy up the seven new 
congressional districts that the state is expected to gain as a result of the 
1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new boundaries for the state's congressional districts won't be 
charted for months, the political battle lines -- both here and in California 
-- are already being drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Despite talk of a kinder-and-gentler redistricting process by some, hard-line 
Democrats in the state want to prevent the Republican Party from laying claim 
to most of the new seats. Republicans, meanwhile, are divided over whether 
their goal should be to redraw all the lines from scratch -- to maximize the 
party's gains -- or to protect existing lawmakers and then seek as many new 
seats as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where the fractures of recent redistricting wars linger like a 
political fault-line within the state's congressional delegation, party 
strategists and reapportionment experts are anticipating another knockdown, 
drag-out confrontation next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The contest is to wear down the enemy," says Rep. William M. Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield), the GOP's congressional point man on redistricting. "We're 
Geronimo. We're Cochise. You fire, and you fall back." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the real power in reshaping the congressional districts will rest 
with the state Legislature and governor, which must draft and approve any new 
redistricting plan. Members of Congress in each party, however, are likely to 
have considerable input into the process. 
</P>
<P>
Like the battles of Geronimo and Cochise, there is plenty of history to the 
current struggle. Republicans waged a costly, prolonged fight over the last 
decade when they unsuccessfully sought to have the courts throw out 
congressional districts that they claimed were ruthlessly gerrymandered to give 
Democrats a disproportionate share of seats. And the GOP is still smarting over 
its failed bid to pass two June ballot initiatives that would have changed the 
way that districts would be drawn after the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the nation are the stakes higher than in California, where -- as 
preliminary census estimates last week showed -- population growth is likely to 
increase the state's congressional delegation from the current 45 to 52. GOP 
dreams of breaking the Democratic lock on Congress before the year 2000 rest 
heavily on the party's prospects in the nation's most-populous state, which 
will elect nearly one in every eight House members in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats hold a 28-17 advantage in the state's congressional delegation. 
Republicans contend that the existing districting plan, masterminded by the 
late Rep. Phillip Burton (D-San Francisco), all but eliminated partisan 
competition in most districts and gave the Democrats many more seats than they 
would have deserved based on statewide voting patterns. Republicans point out 
that in 180 elections that were held between 1982 and 1988, only a single 
congressional seat changed hands between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats counter that the Republicans are blaming redistricting unfairly. 
They say the GOP has failed to field qualified candidates and to mount 
effective campaigns. They argue that the GOP's real goal is not to provide for 
more competition between the parties, but to secure more safe seats for 
Republican candidates and fewer for women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to rip off 12 seats," says Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), 
one of his party's experts on reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of next year's showdown will be determined largely by the California 
gubernatorial election, which is considered the nation's most important because 
of its pivotal role in redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are expected to retain control in November of both houses of the 
state Legislature, which draws the new congressional district lines. This makes 
the gubernatorial race crucial because the governor can veto any plan drafted 
by state lawmakers, with a two-thirds vote in each house needed to override. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein's election would give her party free rein in the 
process. In that case, party strategists say, the Democrats would secure their 
majorities in all three houses and possibly increase them modestly. 
</P>
<P>
One Democrat familiar with early tinkering with possible new boundaries says 
that five new congressional districts could be drawn as winnable by Democrats 
-- but only if popular state legislators ran in some of them. 
</P>
<P>
If Republican Pete Wilson were elected, the Democrats would be forced to 
negotiate or face a stalemate. Failure to override a gubernatorial veto would 
send the issue to the state Supreme Court, which is dominated by appointees of 
outgoing Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the starting point for the Democrats in negotiations would 
be protection of all incumbents in the state Assembly and the Senate. The same 
would be true in the congressional delegation, leaving the seven new seats as 
the focus of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the split, the ugly fights, we had as a result of the last 
redistricting," says Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), dean of the Democratic 
delegation and a proponent of increased bipartisan cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Once the incumbent congressmen are protected, "most of the new seats should go 
to the Republicans," Edwards says, citing population growth in 
Republican-leaning suburbs such as Riverside, San Bernardino, Kern, Ventura and 
parts of Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Democrats had a 54%-35% advantage among California's 10.7 million 
registered voters. The gap has narrowed to 50%-to-39% among nearly 13 million 
voters today. 
</P>
<P>
Less conciliatory Democrats privately reject Edwards' analysis. They note that 
redistricting is based on population, not registration. And even though 
population growth may have been heaviest in GOP-inclined regions, some 
previously Republican areas have become more Democratic as city dwellers pushed 
out into the suburbs, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans also are split. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands), say that a deal with the Democrats that protects incumbents and 
gives the GOP four of the new seats might be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
But those are fighting words to Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne). "That's totally 
unacceptable to us," Dreier says. "What it does is codify the Burton 
gerrymander." 
</P>
<P>
Any agreement that protects incumbents rather than undoing the current plan 
would mean that the Republican Party "would not really be a party," but merely 
"a collection of individuals who operated like feudal lords," says 
Bakersfield's Thomas, co-chairman of the GOP House Task Force on 
Reapportionment. "A number of Republicans, I'm sorry to say, think of it as 'me 
and where I'm going to be,' " Thomas says. "They do not equate becoming a 
majority party as being at least equal to their own interests." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of intraparty tension may surface if Wilson becomes governor. Lewis, 
a member of the House GOP leadership who prides himself on being able to work 
with the Democratic majority, says the key to an agreement is an intelligent 
approach that is "flexible enough to recognize we're not going to win the whole 
ballgame" and seeks "a chance for both sides to win." 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that the districts respect the principle of one person, one 
vote, which means that each includes the same number of residents (the current 
figure is about 525,000; with seven new seats, it would increase to about 
572,000). They must also conform to the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits 
discrimination against minorities by diluting their ability to elect blacks, 
Latinos or Asians to office. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that gerrymandering -- drawing lines 
for political advantage -- could violate the Constitution's guarantee of "equal 
protection of laws." If an electoral scheme "consistently degrades" the 
"influence of some voters, it is unconstitutional," Justice Byron White wrote 
for the majority in a split decision. 
</P>
<P>
But in that case, involving a redistricting suit brought by Indiana Democrats, 
the court did not reject the districts. It also refused in 1989 to hear a 
Republican appeal of a lower court decision, letting the 1982 California lines 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, are already talking about putting the U.S. Supreme Court 
standard to the test again in the 1990s if Feinstein is governor and the 
Democrats seek to exploit their advantage as they did in the 1980s.

9 CAMPERS INJURED BY LIGHTNING STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At least nine campers on an annual Orange County family outing near Big Bear 
Lake Sunday were struck by lightning which arced from a tree into a campsite 
where the group had taken shelter from a heavy hail storm, a spokesman for the 
U.S. Forest Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured men, women and children were taken by ambulance to nearby 
Bear Valley Hospital where a nursing supervisor said they were in good 
condition. "Everybody's fine," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Two more seriously hurt campers were flown by San Bernardino County sheriff's 
helicopter to Loma Linda University Medical Center. Loma Linda nursing 
supervisor Teressa Mikesell said both were in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
The sole casualties were two family dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bob Buhrle of the California Department of Forestry said the accident in 
the San Bernardino National Forest occurred at about 1:30 p.m. when about 20 
members of a larger group gathered under an awning attached to a tent trailer 
to escape a sudden, heavy hail storm. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning struck a tree 10 to 15 feet from the trailer, "spiraled down" the 
tree trunk and jumped "right into the crowd of people," said Buhrle. "It just 
jumped out of the tree and right into the people." 
</P>
<P>
Buhrle said one woman had a bad burn on her hip and others were in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been a mini explosion or a big jolt because we all went down like 
dominoes," said Mary Woodbury, 41, of Orange. "It looked as if we all got hit 
by a bowling ball." 
</P>
<P>
She said one woman, Ginger Dodier, 29, and her niece, Amy, 6, of Westminster, 
were knocked unconscious. The child later suffered convulsions. They were taken 
to Loma Linda University Medical Center where they were reported in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The injured belonged to a group of about 35 aunts, uncles, cousins and a few 
family friends, most from Orange County, who spend holiday weekends twice a 
year in tents at the Juniper Springs campground, said Woodbury's stepdaughter, 
Regina Woodbury from her home in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"They go up every year," said Regina Woodbury. "They go Memorial Weekend and 
Labor Day Weekend." The campground is about seven miles east of Big Bear Lake. 
Regina Woodbury said some in the camping group drove up Thursday night and 
others joined them for the long weekend Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never go back there," said Mary Woodbury. 
</P>
<P>
The injured, aside from Mary Woodbury and Ginger Dodier and her niece, were 
Mary Woodbury's daughter, Melissa, 7, Kevin Dodier, 2 months, and Ginger 
Dodier's sister-in-law, Ann Dodier, 31, of Hesperia. Three family friends, 
Orange County Sheriff's Deputy John Gentile, 29, Kristern Southern, 23, and 
Johanna Dalton, 31, all of Westminster, also were injured. 
</P>

Gentile's mother, Lenore Gutierrez of Westminster said Sunday night she still 
was waiting to hear from her son. "All I know is that he went up camping with 
friends," she said. Gentile has been in the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
for about 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Francis of the Orange County Sheriff's Department said Gentile 
"received a glancing blow" from the lightning. "He was feeling chest pains and 
nausea but he was OK and refused medical treatment," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this summer that lightning struck a large group of 
California campers and hikers. On July 14, one man was killed and four others 
injured at the summit of Mt. Whitney when lighting struck a group of 16 hikers 
taking shelter in a hut.

KLAN LIES LOW; 4 OFFICERS HURT IN ANGRY D.C. CLASH

In the glare of a hot sun and the blare of tinny bullhorns, about 3,000 
anti-klan protesters gathered along Constitution Avenue near the Washington 
monument Sunday afternoon, waiting for the first sight of hoods and robes. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't appear. Opting to avoid a confrontation, the 46 knights of the Ku 
Klux Klan pocketed their permit to march along the avenue to the Capitol, 
instead staying on a bus and proceeding directly to the Capitol under police 
escort. There they held a brief rally for the benefit of a clutch of reporters 
and quickly ducked out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Although four police officers were injured during a bottle-and-brick throwing 
melee, officers prepared for the worst seemed relieved. The last time the klan 
came to the nation's capital, in 1982, the city erupted in violence that left 
windows broken and store shelves ransacked in downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"There is double the level of frustration in this city now compared to 1982," 
said Brian Becker, a counterdemonstration leader. A few minutes before the 
march was to start he warned: "We don't want a confrontation, but the klan is 
such a provocation that we don't know how people will react when they see hoods 
and robes." 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Police, the Capitol Police and the D.C. Metropolitan Police 
practiced riot scenarios weeks in advance. The National Guard was called in to 
direct traffic. Early Sunday, an armored personnel carrier was even spotted 
tucked behind the National Museum of American History. Black and white city 
leaders spent days reminding the city that the white supremacist group has a 
constitutional right to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
"If the klan had showed, there would definitely have been violence," said 
Edward Cohen, a 23-year-old Washington native who turned out to demonstrate 
against the klan. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out," he added, "although I 
promised to bring my wife back a hood." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing that the march was cancelled, counterdemonstrators took off 
toward the Capitol en masse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to find them, just like a heat-seeking missile. They can't get 
away," shouted one demonstrator as he marched along the wide, museum-sided 
avenue. But as the crowd neared Capitol Hill, tight lines of police, some 
carrying sticks, others in riot gear, blocked their path. 
</P>
<P>
A tense standoff ensued. After a loud exchange of words, the crowd began 
hurling paper, soft-drink bottles and pieces of bricks and concrete at the blue 
line of officers. In response, police set off M-80 explosives to frighten the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
When the confrontation ended about an hour later, four police officers, 
including a police department spokesman, were injured. Six counterdemonstrators 
were arrested, one for inciting a riot. There were no immediate reports of 
civilian injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But most participants agreed that, under the circumstances, all went well. "I 
think that after what happened with Marion Barry, all the homeless in this 
city, all the unemployed and the drug problem," said Cohen, "all the anger 
would have been turned on (the klan)." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was pleased, however. Don and Donna Decker were on their way to 
visit the Vietnam Memorial on Sunday morning but were diverted by the crowd. 
The retired couple from Eaton, Ohio, were carrying a new video camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a person in a sheet and I wanted to take a picture of one with 
my new camera," Donna Decker said sadly. "But I didn't get the chance."

NASA engineers Sunday morning replaced the electronic component that caused the 
latest delay for Columbia and the $150-million Astro observatory, clearing the 
way for a launch as early as 10:20 p.m. PDT Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers had encountered some initial problems testing the new component, but 
by 2 p.m. Sunday, NASA spokesman Dick Young said the problem had been corrected 
and a new countdown would begin at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The latest problem to afflict the star-crossed Astro observatory, which has 
been delayed since 1986, occurred late Wednesday. Just after engineers closed 
the payload bay doors on Columbia, technicians in the control room lost contact 
with one of the observatory's four telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
That instrument, the Broad Band X-ray Telescope, is cooled by liquid argon at a 
pressure and temperature that must be monitored for safety. The failed 
component was the one that converts temperature and pressure data from the 
telescope into a form that can be sent to the control room via telephone lines 
while the shuttle is on the pad. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers had hoped to make a quick fix by using a specially prepared cable to 
route the signal through a redundant unit, a course that would have allowed for 
launch Tuesday evening. But the patch did not work and the component had to be 
replaced, necessitating an extra day's delay. 
</P>
<P>
Initial tests of the replacement unit showed that it would work on the ground, 
but not necessarily in space. That problem was found to be in the software, and 
was readily corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers will have a "window" of two hours and four minutes in which to launch 
the mission Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
During the nine or 10 days in space, Columbia's crew of seven will work around 
the clock with the four telescopes to observe the universe in ultraviolet and 
X-ray wavelengths, which are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and so are 
inaccessible to ground-based telescopes.

Crime against person or property affected one in four American households last 
year, a rate virtually the same as that of the past five years, a Justice 
Department report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975, when this statistical series commenced, about one in three households 
was struck by crime," said Steven Dillingham of the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of households that were scenes of violence or of burglary or 
other property crime in 1989 was 24.9%, up slightly from 24.6% in 1988, the 
report said. The figures include attempts as well as completed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In 23.5 million households, one of these crimes occurred: rape, assault, 
robbery, personal theft, theft of household goods, burglary and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
The figures come from the National Crime Survey, which annually surveys members 
of 49,000 households nationwide.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confusion reigned Sunday over the exodus of hostage women and children from 
Iraq, while the distressing task remained of accounting for just who would be 
left behind and what jeopardy they are in. 
</P>
<P>
A flight of hostages scheduled to leave on a jetliner from France was canceled 
without explanation Sunday night, although the plane was rescheduled to arrive 
here today. In all, about 700 Western and Japanese hostages have fled by air in 
the past two days, many of them Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq reiterated its decision to free women and children but not Western and 
Japanese men. Some of the foreigners have been placed at industrial and 
military installations as a "shield" against attack from the multinational 
forces now gathered in the Persian Gulf region in defense of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are free to leave, and men are not free," said government spokesman 
Najil Hadithi again Sunday. "Because the American Administration is threatening 
Iraq with war, we believe that by holding these people in these installations, 
the war fever in the White House is reduced." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials have listed airports, air force bases, power plants, oil 
refineries, petrochemical plants, fuel storage depots and communications 
centers as likely sites where the human "shields" will be detained. U.S. 
officials have added chemical weapons plants to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The initial departure of hostages was a relief to diplomats who are having 
trouble calculating exactly which of their citizens are where. The problem is 
especially acute in Kuwait, where the Iraqis have pulled the plug on telephone 
lines in embassies and where travel is proscribed by military order. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared embassies in conquered seaside Kuwait city to be redundant 
because Iraq has annexed Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
American officials know of no more than 10 American citizens who have been 
rounded up in Iraq and sent to strategic industrial and military sites. The 
whereabouts and fate of the other 400 or so mostly male U.S. citizens still 
believed to be in Iraq are not certain. "It's a mystery," said an American 
diplomat here. 
</P>
<P>
At least three dozen Americans were bused to Baghdad from Kuwait shortly after 
the Aug. 2 invasion, and many of those are probably being held as human 
shields, local observers say. 
</P>
<P>
The dimension of the overall American hostage problem -- that is, the numbers 
of Americans forbidden to leave Iraq and Kuwait, whether they are in custody or 
not -- was whittled down slightly by officials here. The number of Americans in 
Kuwait is now estimated to be 2,000. Among those, 1,400 are women and children 
who are presumably free to leave in the wake of the decision last week 
announced by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Escapes from Kuwait may account for the 20% reduction in estimated number of 
U.S. citizens stranded there. Some have escaped to Saudi Arabia and never 
checked in with the U.S. diplomatic missions in that country. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may have been caught by the Iraqis on the way. Some may have died in the 
desert," said a Western diplomat here. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen Americans have taken refuge on U.S. diplomatic property in 
Kuwait. Diplomats there ran into a form of double jeopardy in trying to keep 
track of their citizens. With lines cut, it is impossible to maintain telephone 
contact. Even when the phones were working, diplomats hesitated to call; the 
Iraqis could trace the numbers and perhaps ferret out Americans who were in 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
The high ratio of women and children to male Americans in Kuwait was attributed 
to marriages between U.S. women and Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Abdul Karim, who fled Iraq on Saturday with her four children, left 
behind her Jordanian husband in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going back to work," she said, explaining that he holds a job at an oil 
company. "He's exempt from all this." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Karim was born in Denver and left the United States 12 years ago. Her 
blonde, foreign appearance did not cause her trouble in Kuwait, although she 
admitted that after the invasion she largely stayed indoors. Someone had 
explained to her that since she was married to an Arab man, her family would be 
treated like Arabs and not face detention. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Karim was ambivalent about the Persian Gulf crisis. "I think the Arabs 
should stay on their side and the Americans on theirs," she remarked. 
</P>
<P>
She has not visited her native land for six years and felt that "the Arab world 
is more my own and going back to America scares" her. 
</P>
<P>
About half the number of the estimated 400 Americans in Iraq itself are 
scattered around on U.S. diplomatic property. Of the other 200 or so, most are 
living at home. The number vulnerable to being rounded up and sent to strategic 
spots as human "shields" was estimated to be in the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
The drama of husbands being separated from wives and left to an uncertain fate 
is being shared not only by Americans but an array of other nationalities. The 
Western and Japanese population of Kuwait and Iraq together was placed at about 
12,000 when the crisis began early last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian Embassy said that seven Italians were picked up in Kuwait and have 
disappeared. Japanese officials believe that 143 of their citizens have been 
rounded up and taken as human "shields." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a British citizen who was seeing his wife and four teen-age 
children off on a West German jet to freedom said "the decision to separate was 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure of family has been a weight on my mind," he said, adding in 
understatement, "The uncertainty was always unsettling."

VIGIL FOR WIFE, DAUGHTERS ENDS WITH A CALL FROM STATE DEPT.

Buoyed by endless cups of strong coffee, Jay Anaim has been glued to his 
television for the past four weeks searching for clues about when and if his 
wife and three young daughters would be allowed to leave Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The anxious vigil ended Sunday morning when U.S. State Department officials 
called the La Mirada man to say his family had landed safely in Frankfurt, West 
Germany, and is due to arrive in Los Angeles tonight. 
</P>
<P>
They also provided Anaim, 31, with the telephone number of the Frankfurt hotel 
where his wife and daughters were staying overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Anaim stabbed the buttons of the telephone that would connect 
him with his wife, who had been in the Iraqi port city of Basra visiting her 
ailing father when Iraqi troops invaded nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of emotion over here," Nidhal Anaim told her husband on the 
phone from Frankfurt. "At one point, we were boarding the plane when Iraqi 
officials said the flight had been canceled -- we began to wonder if we would 
ever get out." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Lufthansa flight carrying 311 people -- including Americans, 
Spaniards, Swedes and other European nationals -- was allowed to leave Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Through all the uncertainty, Anaim's 9-year-old daughter, Donia, was worried 
about one thing -- missing her first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad, when does school start?" she blurted over the telephone Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In about a week, darling," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I can't be late for the first day of school," said Donia, a 4th-grade 
student at La Pluma Elementary School in La Mirada. "Will you see us at the 
airport when we get home?" 
</P>
<P>
"You bet!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
After a warm goodby, Anaim wiped his brow and said, "I was born in Jerusalem 
and have seen one war after another over there. But this has been the longest 
month of my life. All I could see in my mind were images of Kurdish children 
killed by poison gas." 
</P>
<P>
Until the Aug. 2 invasion, Anaim's life had focused on passing a final 
examination in chiropractor's school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I flunked that test," said Anaim, who took it four days after the 
Iraqis marched into Kuwait. "There was just too much on my mind at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "It's over," Anaim said. "Thank God, it's over."

SEA PATROL: 46 AMERICANS ADAPT THEIR DRUG-BUSTING TACTICS TO GULF SHIP-BOARDING

<P>
U.S. Coast Guardsmen, veterans of drug-busting boarding parties off American 
shores, have become point men in the blockade of Iraqi supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six guardsmen arrived in the region a week ago and have been assigned to 
U.S. warships patrolling the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Oman. 
It's a different scene, with larger ships, but the tactics are the same. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like hanging out with the biggest kid on the block," said Lt. Jeff 
Fay, describing boarding operations on suspect shipping in blockade waters. The 
36-year-old New Yorker said a Navy warship provides a "persuasive presence" 
when it comes alongside a freighter for boarding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier than drug duty," Fay said, noting the Coast Guard's experience in 
overhauling ships attempting to reach American shores with a load of cocaine 
from Colombia. Drug-runners from Colombia work the wide-open seas of the 
Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the Caribbean Sea. Shipping headed for Iraqi or 
Kuwaiti ports at the top of the Persian Gulf, or the Jordanian port of Aqaba, 
have to pass through narrow straits. 
</P>
<P>
"We just sit there (in the straits) and say, 'Oops, here they co" Fay explained 
during a break in the wardroom of the La Salle, command ship of the Navy's 
Middle East Task Force. Coast guardsmen said no boardings have yet taken place 
within the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The guardsmen have been broken into 10 four-man teams, each assigned to 
American warships. Six others are posted to the command staff. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Friday in Washington that U.S. ships have 
challenged about 250 merchant vessels in the last week in enforcing the 
U.N.-mandated blockade of supplies bound for Iraq and occupied Kuwait. He said 
fewer than 10 have been boarded so far. 
</P>
<P>
Fay said the boarded ships were flying the flags of Sri Lanka, Kuwait and India 
among other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is routine. A ship is hailed and asked its cargo and destination. 
Persian Gulf ships were challenging 30 to 40 merchant vessels a week, Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
If the naval commander doubts the response from the ship's master, a boarding 
party is dispatched. It can include both guardsmen and sailors.

"It depends on what he tells us," Fay explained. "If it's suspect, we go 
aboard, check the manifest, the cargo, the charts." The decision to board is 
made by the warship's skipper in coordination with higher command. But Fay and 
other Coast Guard officers say the skippers have on-the-spot authority. "A 
captain on these ships gets paid good money to do his job," Fay explained. 
"They (higher commanders) have tried not to micro-manage it too much." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Al Crespo, a Californian who has been assigned to Coast Guard drug duty out 
of Miami for the past six years, said: "In Miami our job is to enforce U.S. 
law. Out here we're enforcing U.N. resolutions which are U.S. policy." 
Technically, the guardsmen are assigned to units called Law Enforcement 
Detachments. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo, called to Persian Gulf duty on two hours' notice two weeks ago, related 
the story of a New Orleans based-guardsman who received the call while his wife 
was out grocery shopping. He left her a note. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Crespo or Fay reported resistance from boarded ships. Nor had they met 
resistance from drug-runners halfway around the world in Western Hemisphere 
waters. "The captains of the drug-runners just tell you to come aboard and hope 
you won't find anything," Crespo explained. Merchant skippers in these waters, 
he said, "are no more likely to shoot than the druggies" when faced with an 
armed boarding party backed up by a warship. 
</P>
<P>
He did not describe boarding procedures aboard the American ships, but British 
naval officers said their parties would use ship-based helicopters to ferry 
six-man teams of Royal Marines to suspect ships. Armed with submachine guns and 
stun grenades, the marines would descend by ropes to the bridge of the ship, 
the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Use of inflatable boats was ruled out because big ships, particularly tankers, 
ride too high in the water for a quick ascent. 
</P>
<P>
Both British and American naval officers said they are confident that no large 
amounts of supplies could run the sea blockade. "Some small boats might get 
through," Crespo said, "but they'd have to use a lot of them to make any impact 
at all."

RIFTS REPORTED AMONG RADICAL PLO LEADERS

Radical Palestinian leader George Habash has split with his longtime Syrian 
backers and is now in Iraq, marking a major shift within the PLO triggered by 
the Persian Gulf crisis, informed sources reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They also reported that another radical, Nayef Hawatmeh, is struggling to 
retain control of his group, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, after a mutiny sparked by his support for Syria's anti-Iraq stand in 
the month-old crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The developments underlined the shock waves striking within the Palestine 
Liberation Organization caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, qualified 
by a condemnation of the occupation of the gulf kingdom, has alienated the 
organization from the Arab mainstream that has opposed Hussein's action. 
</P>
<P>
That has cut Arafat off from the financial support of Saudi Arabia and other 
pro-Western gulf states, while at the same time firing up the PLO's radicals, 
like Habash and Hawatmeh. 
</P>
<P>
They reluctantly went along with Arafat's 1988 peace initiative, in which he 
renounced terrorism and recognized Israel. They have long argued that only 
military struggle will achieve a Palestinian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has demanded an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip in any settlement of the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Habash, 64, heads the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the 
second-largest faction in the PLO after Arafat's Fatah movement. 
</P>
<P>
His new alliance with Hussein marks an increasing tilt by PLO radicals toward 
Baghdad amid growing fears that Palestinian militants and other Arab groups 
will launch terrorist attacks on U.S., Western and Arab targets to support 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh, 54, has said that he cannot back the Iraqis, who he says have done to 
Kuwait what the Israelis did to Palestine. But the Democratic Front's deputy 
secretary general, Yasser Abed-Rabbo, flew to Baghdad with Arafat last week, 
cementing the split from Hawatmeh's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein already harbors the radical Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction 
led by Mohammed Abbas, known as Abul Abbas. That group hijacked the Italian 
cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985 and was behind an abortive seaborne raid on 
Israel last May. 
</P>
<P>
That operation led President Bush to suspend an 18-month dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency said in a terse dispatch that Hussein met with 
Habash on Sunday on the crisis.

SAUDI OIL OUTPUT UP 2 MILLION BARRELS A DAY AS PROMISED

Saudi Arabia has increased its oil production by 2 million barrels a day, 
fulfilling a pledge to offset shortages caused by the worldwide embargo against 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, Riyadh Radio said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"A well-informed Saudi source said Sunday that Saudi Arabia has raised its oil 
production to 7.4 million barrels a day, effective Friday," the radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's previous OPEC-decreed quota was 5.4 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said that the United Arab Emirates also increased its 
production by 500,000 barrels per day and Venezuela by 300,000 barrels a day, 
the radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries in Vienna last week to increase the production ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC's decision was prompted by the international embargo imposed against 
shipments of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir said last month that his country would boost 
its daily production by 2 million barrels a day with or without OPEC's 
approval.

CAMBODIA'S PRESIDENT FAILS TO EMBRACE PEACE PROPOSAL

The president of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government, appearing to 
reject key features of a new U.N. peace plan, said his government wants to 
maintain the political and military status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and 
Pacific affairs, said Sunday that Vietnam had similar reservations in talks 
with the United States last week. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodian President Heng Samrin's comments came in a speech broadcast by the 
state radio Saturday. The text was seen Sunday in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
He said his government regarded the U.N. plan "as a basic document" for future 
discussions and was ready to discuss it with the guerrillas in talks Indonesia 
is arranging. 
</P>
<P>
But he said with no elaboration that his government's stance "is to maintain 
its status quo -- both politically and (militarily)." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. role, he said, should include verifying that agreements are 
implemented and organizing new elections. 
</P>
<P>
The three rebel groups fighting the government have expressed support for the 
plan. Washington backs two of the guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam voiced its reservations with the U.N. plan at a meeting at the United 
Nations on Friday in which the United States tried to persuade it to back the 
plan, Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese, he said, had reservations about "issues related to military 
arrangements and some of the administrative arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amnesty International today accused communist guerrillas of 
massacring more than 50 people in two train attacks in central Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The international human rights group issued a statement urging the Cambodian 
guerrilla coalition, which includes the communist Khmer Rouge, to ensure that 
those involved in the killings "are removed from their positions and brought to 
justice."

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials Sunday labeled Laborfest '90 a mellow street party, a sharp 
contrast with the tumultuous Labor Day weekend beach bash a year ago that 
degenerated into violent looting and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Police had reported no major incidents Sunday and no felony arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday evening, police had reported 48 arrests, including 26 for public 
intoxication, and four summonses for unnecessary noise. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50% of those charged with misdemeanors were white, 40% were black and 
the few others were from different ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The city had spent an estimated $2 million in preparations, including costs 
related to running nonstop shuttle buses and overtime for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated that 28,000 visitors were at the resort strip, down from 
the estimated 100,000 who jammed onto Atlantic and Pacific avenues last year. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, Virginia Beach awoke on a Sunday morning to what looked like a 
war zone. More than 100 storefronts had been smashed and merchandise looted at 
a cost of $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The violence, which erupted during an annual gathering of college students from 
predominantly black universities known then as "Greekfest," divided the city 
and carried racial reverberations across the country.

3 STILL IN CUSTODY AFTER BRAWL AT HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles men remained in custody Sunday after a violent brawl that 
erupted during a birthday party at an Inglewood hotel Saturday night, leaving 
one party-goer dead. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of attempted murder were Michael Keith Williams, 20, his 
cousin, Marcus Williams, 21, and Delton Prescott, 24, Inglewood police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said guests at the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel, located across the street 
from the Forum, became virtual hostages in their rooms after a rap music party 
ended with rampaging party-goers engaging in a running gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were wounded in a shoot-out that began in the ballroom and ended in the 
parking lot. In the panic that ensued, Roderick Williams, 22, of Los Angeles 
was killed when he was hit by a fleeing car, police said. The three men 
arrested are not suspects in the hit-and-run, police said, adding that they are 
still seeking the driver of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott was in custody at the Los Angeles County Jail after treatment at a 
local hospital for a wound on his hand and the other two suspects were being 
held in Inglewood City Jail, Lt. David Garza said. Bail had not been set, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbance began about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, when a fight broke out during 
the rap party that doubled as a birthday celebration for one of the guests, 
police said.

Today marks the celebration of Labor Day, set aside to recognize labor's 
contribution to the nation.

Credit for the idea of Labor Day is given to Matthew Maguire, a New Jersey 
machinist, and Peter J. McGuire of New York, co- founder of a labor 
organization that eventually became the American Federation of Labor. After 
several states began observing the first Monday in September as Labor Day in 
the 1880s, Congress made the day a federal holiday in 1894.

INVESTMENT SUIT NAMES EX-HARBOR OFFICIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURT ACTION: IRA DISTENFIELD, FORMER FUND-RAISER FOR MAYOR BRADLEY, IS ACCUSED 
OF MISAPPROPRIATING MONEY POLITICAL INSIDERS PLACED IN A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A onetime Los Angeles Harbor commissioner who was one of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
biggest fund-raisers has been sued by five current and former city 
commissioners for allegedly misappropriating their investments in a limited 
partnership that included several other political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Nine plaintiffs including Airport Commissioner Johnnie Cochran, Harbor 
Commissioner Jun Mori and other confidants of Bradley have accused Ira 
Distenfield of fraud and breach of contract in managing the $315,000 invested 
by partners in now-defunct Financial Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that those funds, and at least $182,000 in other assets 
including office equipment and furniture, were converted to the personal use of 
Distenfield and other defendants. Just how that occurred is not explained in 
the lawsuit, which seeks release of FSG's financial records and return of each 
partner's $35,000 investment in the Century City company. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also seeks $3 million in punitive damages from Distenfield and 
other defendants including Integrated Resources Equity Corp., a subsidiary of a 
Delaware-based financial services firm whose fortunes plummeted last year along 
with its junk-bond investment adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Integrated 
Resources was named because it employed Distenfield as a West Coast 
representative and figures, according to the lawsuit, in the creation of FSG. 
</P>
<P>
Distenfield, now an investment broker in Santa Barbara, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Jules Radcliff, denied the allegations, insisting FSG's books 
have already been opened to plaintiffs. He also said plaintiffs were unfairly 
blaming Distenfield, not Integrated Resources, for FSG's demise. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a business go bad on them and everybody is trying to figure out why," 
Radcliff said. "But I suspect all of them would acknowledge that the business 
was built largely on Integrated Resources and when it ran into trouble, it 
brought this business down." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Christine Page, representing Integrated Resources, declined comment on 
the lawsuit except to deny wrongdoing by the company and disavow any knowledge 
of how Distenfield ran FSG. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not denying he was a registered representative, but we deny he was acting 
at the behest of the company in entering into this transaction with the 
plaintiffs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Distenfield resigned as president of the Harbor Commission in May, 1989, 
complaining that press inquiries about him were an unfair burden on his family, 
including wife Linda, a former employee of Bradley. Distenfield's resignation 
was announced the day before The Times reported that he testified, at a New 
York Stock Exchange hearing in 1987, that he used his influence with Bradley to 
win a coveted City Hall contract for a former employer. 
</P>
<P>
Since his resignation, Distenfield, once a political power broker and prolific 
fund-raiser for Bradley, has been exiled from the mayor's inner circle, City 
Hall observers say. The lawsuit is the latest indication that Distenfield has 
fallen into disfavor. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was speculating, I would say there is a correlation" between the lawsuit 
and Distenfield's departure from Bradley's inner circle, said Brian Sun, 
another of Distenfield's attorneys. "Maybe some people thought, 'Ira has fallen 
from grace, so we can dump on him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs who could be reached for comment insisted the lawsuit was based on 
business, not politics, though several conceded it was sensitive because of the 
group's connections to Bradley. And one said privately that the suit might have 
been avoided at all costs if Distenfield was still a Bradley insider. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that there might not have been a lawsuit if Ira was still on the 
commission and had not gotten into the problems he did last year," said the 
plaintiff, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, a plaintiff as well as attorney for the group's lawsuit, denied 
that suggestion. "This has absolutely nothing to do with politics," said 
Papiano, another Bradley contributor and City Hall insider. "We just want to 
know where the (partnerships') money went." 
</P>
<P>
Papiano and other plaintiffs claimed the lawsuit, filed April 27, followed 
months of unsuccessful efforts to obtain FSG's records. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wanted this on the public record. It was felt it would be better not to 
file the lawsuit because it would look bad politically," said investor Stephen 
Moses, a prominent Los Angeles builder and political fund-raiser. "But we felt 
there was no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
Court papers and information provided by plaintiffs show Distenfield formed FSG 
in April, 1988, collecting $35,000 from each of the limited partners. The firm, 
according to its partnership agreement, was to operate, service and manage 
securities broker-dealer businesses and other types of ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Before FSG opened for business, according to investor Moses, Distenfield told 
the eventual partners he had an agreement with Integrated Resources for a joint 
venture operation with the then-thriving financial services firm so long as he 
could secure local investors. "Ira needed a certain amount of capital and on 
his behalf we were investing," Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
But after assurances that their money would be secured in a special account, 
the limited partners found their investments were either paid to Distenfield in 
commissions or spent by him for unspecified personal expenses, the lawsuit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
It further alleges the partners were repeatedly denied access to FSG's records. 
The suit claims the books were not fully opened to the plaintiffs even after 
one of them, Lance Brisson, made a written demand on June 13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Around August, 1989, according to plaintiff Raymond Veltman, Distenfield told 
the limited partners FSG was in financial straits because of problems facing 
Integrated Resources. At that time, Integrated Resources had just defaulted on 
$1 billion of commercial debt and was announcing a restructuring plan that 
included financing by Drexel Burnham Lambert, which earlier helped raise $2 
billion for the corporation, most of it in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
One month later, with partners unwilling to invest more money, FSG closed. 
</P>
<P>
From that time until the lawsuit was filed, according to the plaintiffs, 
Distenfield refused to provide the financial records sought by the limited 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see the records," said plaintiff Veltman, a city telecommunications 
commissioner. "We don't want to let him off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
But Distenfield's attorneys claim FSG's records have been available for months 
and that the limited partners are demanding additional records for Integrated 
Resources, a separate business. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs include attorney Craig Cogut, former president of a company that 
provided support services to junk bond king Michael Milken's high-yield bond 
group at Drexel, and Charles Winner and Ethan Wagner, partners in the political 
consulting firm Winner-Wagner &amp; Associates. Winner also is a former 
telecommunications commissioner and the firm employes Brisson, another former 
member of the telecommunications commission. 
</P>
<P>
The outside accountant for FSG is another telecommunications commissioner, 
Harvey Bookstein, a certified public accountant who is neither a plaintiff nor 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
A status conference on the lawsuit is scheduled for Sept. 27.

Tonga in Space? There Just Had to Be a San Diego Link 
</P>
<P>
Whenever I read about a high-stakes financial deal, with allegations flying in 
all directions, I just assume a San Diegan is at the bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
So it was when I read "Tiny Tonga Seeks Satellite Empire in Space" on the front 
page of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
An "ambitious American entrepreneur" is seeking to secure for the South Pacific 
kingdom the last 16 orbiting patterns for communication satellites linking the 
United States, Asia and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The mastermind of Tonga's bid is Matt C. Nilson, 51, head of Nilson Research 
Corp., a telecommunications consulting company. The company has offices in 
Tonga, Manila and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
I caught up to Nilson at his home in Bay Park, overlooking Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
He says he retired in 1987 after working at General Dynamics/Convair. He went 
to Tonga to enjoy his retirement in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
He became good friends with Tonga's King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. Nilson and the 
king decided to make a bold bid for satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its sovereignty and location, Tonga is said to have a good claim 
under the international law that limits the number of satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The first three satellites are expected to cost a total of $500 million to $600 
million. But finding investors probably won't be difficult in this 
satellite-short world. 
</P>
<P>
Tonga can keep a tiny portion of the satellite capacity for its own use and 
lease out the rest. This in a country whose economy is dependent on fishing, 
coconuts and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led consortium of nations is fuming at Tonga and Nilson. It says Tonga 
just wants to capture the market on satellites and jack up the price at will. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Nilson. He says the consortium is miffed because its 
telecommunications hegemony is threatened: "What we've done is pull off a 
coup." 
</P>
<P>
I would have liked to talk more to Nilson, but I have research to do. 
</P>
<P>
I'm positive there must have been a San Diegan present when the Pyramids were 
financed. Can you imagine the commission on a job like that? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where Bar Meets Turf 
</P>
<P>
Your government in action. 
</P>
<P>
* Need an attorney? Call the track. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four attorneys from the San Diego city attorney's office, plus 18 summer 
interns, spouses and children, trekked to the Del Mar Race Track last Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys were all taking either comp or vacation time. The court schedule 
was said to be light because a State Bar meeting had just finished. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 20 jury trials a day for the next two weeks," said Chief Deputy City 
Atty. Susan Heath. "The time to play was this one week only." 
</P>
<P>
They may know the law, but horses are another matter. Not a Pick Six in the 
bunch. 
</P>
<P>
* Speaking of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller is fighting the county Department of General Services 
over plans to oust his staffers from the County Regional Center in El Cajon and 
relocate them in rented space in a shopping center next to a toy store. 
</P>
<P>
One of Miller's concerns is that the ground-level office would leave 
prosecutors vulnerable to drive-by violence from vindictive defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Miller labels as "rather remarkable" a suggestion from General Services that he 
could minimize the danger to prosecutors by making sure the desks near the 
windows are assigned to secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
He has sent a hotly worded letter to Chief Administrative Officer Norman 
Hickey. 
</P>
<P>
* Last week was the final stretch of the legislative session in Sacramento, 
arguably the most important week of the session, with dozens of bills being 
voted on. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) took the week off to prepare for his 
son's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hacker's Lament 
</P>
<P>
The Coronado Golf Course is a jewel, but it has one flaw: loudspeakers at the 
clubhouse spew music over several holes. 
</P>
<P>
As I was hacking toward the green on the second hole (par 5, 495 yards) I heard 
"The Impossible Dream." 
</P>
<P>
I resent that.

BAN ON POLITICAL FORGERY PASSES DESPITE DETOURS

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) first introduced a bill outlawing the 
use of phony endorsements in political campaigns, it was with a righteous zeal. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the measure limped into the homestretch last week -- after being 
repeatedly tripped, stalled, amended and sideswiped -- Craven confessed to 
feeling more like one of the condemned. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suffered the rigors of the damned on this thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Friday, the last business day of the 1990 legislative session, 
that the bill was snatched from an ignominious death. The final version 
approved by the Legislature makes it a felony to use unauthorized "handwritten 
or mechanically reproduced" signatures in campaign material, or to take bona 
fide signatures "out of context." Violations could be punished by a year in 
jail or fines up to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the treatment by well-meaning legislators and unseen forces has had all the 
markings of a whodunit: The knife has gone in several times, but there have 
been no witnesses or fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Craven points to professional political consultants and campaign managers -- 
people who have been known to deceive voters with phantom endorsements and 
signatures -- as the culprits. His prime suspect has been Los Angeles-based 
B.A.D. Campaigns Inc., a powerful consulting firm operated by Michael Berman 
and Carl D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
Phone messages left at B.A.D. Friday were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed Friday 
that Berman had called to complain about an earlier version of the measure. He 
emphasized, however, that the inquiry had less to do with the bill's 
difficulties than legislative concerns about a tricky subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear-cut. . . . We're all against forgery," Roberti said. "The issue 
is who's the responsible party?" 
</P>
<P>
For the record, no one has ever signed up to oppose the measure. It has been 
approved by lopsided margins at every turn, including a 72-1 slam-dunk in the 
Assembly earlier last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some very uncanny things have happened. The bill has been forced through 
more hoops than Shamu on a busy day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been through three policy committees, two fiscal committees, two floor 
votes, 10 rounds of amendments," said Allen Sumner, assistant attorney general 
who has helped Craven with the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been in the Elections Code, the Government Code, the Penal Code and now 
the Civil Code," he said. "And, with 24 hours left in the legislative session, 
they still want to rewrite it virtually from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty rude stuff for a measure that Craven, a 17-year veteran, thought was a 
cinch to sail through the Legislature. He introduced it with a flourish shortly 
after the 3rd District Court of Appeal threw out felony forgery charges against 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was charged with forging then-President Ronald Reagan's signature to 
thousands of 1986 campaign smear pieces against Democrats in six state Assembly 
races, despite White House orders not to use the President's name. One of those 
mailers targeted Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) and accused him of 
"caving in to the powerful underworld drug industry." 
</P>
<P>
Although the court condemned the behavior as "misconduct which impinges on the 
public's interest," it ruled in January that no one was defrauded of money or 
property -- necessary ingredients under the law for felony forgery charges. 
Since the state's election code is silent on forgery, the charges were thrown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 31, Craven introduced his bill to close the loophole. At first, it 
applied to signatures and phony endorsements in all campaign material or 
advertisements. If anyone doubted the rightness of the cause, Reagan himself 
endorsed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Craven said the idea was to get the bill approved and to the governor in time 
for the June primary season. And that seemed to be within reach when the Senate 
passed it 31 to 3 in March. 
</P>
<P>
But, over in the Assembly, things began to go bump in the night. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the relatively straightforward idea was, in the words of 
Craven's staff, "loved to death." It was sent on a circuitous track through 
three committees, amended six times and eventually put into the state's Fair 
Political Practices Act -- a process that conveniently kept the bill in limbo 
until after the primaries, when most legislative contests are actually decided. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, for instance, Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) dodged 
a bullet after a scandal about double-dipping in her campaign funds. And 
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) beat out a serious challenge from Celia 
Ballesteros with behind-the-scenes help from Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Craven and the attorney general's staff were willing to give 
lawmakers looking over his bill the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few bills where they immediately identify with the topic 
and everyone has his or her own interpretation of his or her own campaigns," 
said Sumner. "You see the same treatment with the ethics bills about 
honorariums. There is a lot more tinkering, a lot more amendments, a lot more 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the incident over amendments. The Assembly Ways and Means Committee 
decided Aug. 8 to make some perfunctory wording changes in the bill. Despite 
ample time, records show that the amended form of the bill wasn't in print 
until Aug. 20, a 12-day gap that no one has been able to explain. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the delayed printing of the amended bill violated a little-known 
deadline that requires measures involving the political reform act to be 
delivered to the Fair Political Practices Commission for public review. This 
year, the deadline for delivery to the agency's office, just a few blocks from 
the Capitol, was no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Craven's bill showed up in the mail Aug. 21. The Oceanside Republican believed 
that was a sign that someone was trying to kill the measure through procedure, 
and not through a public vote in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion became even more pronounced when Craven's staff discovered that 
two other FPPC-related bills were given the royal treatment by Assembly clerks. 
Although the two other Senate bills bear the same Monday, Aug. 20 amendment 
date, special preprint versions were hand-delivered to the FPPC offices at 4:26 
p.m. on deadline Friday, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Without that special treatment, Craven's bill was left for dead, but his staff 
maneuvered around the obstacle by having it taken out of the political reform 
act and put into the penal code -- a move that removed the deadline provisions 
and revived the bill. It was passed by the Assembly on Monday and approved 29 
to 3 by the Senate on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Craven's bill was bound for the governor's desk. Yet, in another 
bizarre twist, the measure was procedurally plucked in mid-flight on its way 
out of the Legislature so that lawmakers could take one more look at it. 
</P>
<P>
The request prompted two days of quibbling among legislators over what 
constitutes a signature. Did it only apply to a genuine handwritten signature? 
What about signatures that are actually written by machines, such as the Reagan 
name later forged by Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
Roberti wanted Craven to insert the words "cursive" and "handwritten" into the 
bill -- a step that would make double sure to leave untouched printed names. 
</P>
<P>
Such printed names and endorsements are used on so-called "slate mailers," a 
piece of campaign literature that lumps together the names of political 
candidates from the same party but running for different offices. Berman and 
D'Agostino's firm is the leading slate mail consultant for Democratic hopefuls 
in Los Angeles and other areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
It also found itself in court several years ago for allegedly using phony 
quotes in a last-minute 1984 slate mailer against Assemblyman Phillip Wyman 
(R-Tehachapi). The campaign material attributed quotes critical of Wyman to a 
state senator and the state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Wyman 
said the quotes were false and sued under false advertising statutes, but lost 
on the ground that business law does not apply to political speech. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Roberti acknowledged that Berman called his office about the bill. 
But the Senate leader said it was his personal concerns that prompted him to 
take a closer look at Craven's bill, even after it was passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is always difficult to sort through who is at fault when there are 
charges of misquotes and phony endorsements. People who allow the use of their 
printed names in the mailers sometimes cave into criticism and disavow their 
actions to save face. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is, who should get the blame?" said Roberti. "Is it the campaign 
manager? Is it the candidate? Or is it the person who probably allowed the 
endorsement to be used but changed his mind?" 
</P>
<P>
With the additional changes Friday, Roberti said the Craven bill was narrowed 
to deal with flat-out forgeries, as represented by the Lewis case. And, with 
all questions apparently settled, the measure was finally approved by the 
entire Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be morbid about it," Craven reflected afterwards about what 
his bill went through. "In reflection, the effort was well worth it, and it 
produced a product that would serve the people well."

SNAILS PACE THE RECYCLING OF NUTRIENTS IN DESERT SOIL

Rock-eating snails appear to make a critical contribution to the fertilization 
of desert soils by speeding the return of a valuable nutrient -- nitrogen -- to 
the ground. The snails dine on a diet of limestone rock containing lichens, a 
mixture of nitrogen-containing fungi and algae, and return the nutrient to the 
soil in their feces, contributing 11% of the nitrogen released into the desert 
soil each year, researchers reported last week in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen, an element essential to all forms of life, continually cycles 
throughout ecosystems as plants absorb it from the soil and pass it to animals 
through food chains. Bacteria, in turn, break down plant and animal wastes, 
returning nitrogen to the soil. Scientists previously thought snails and other 
plant-eating animals, known as herbivores, played an insignificant role in the 
nitrogen cycle, said co-author Clive Jones of the Institute of Ecosystem 
Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied the role of snails in nitrogen cycling in the Central 
Negev Highlands of Israel, a limestone rock desert.

ULTRASOUND REVEALS BIRTH DEFECTS 
</P>

Ultrasound scans can be accurate enough to replace amniocentesis for checking 
fetuses for spinal abnormalities and other severe birth defects, researchers 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Amniocentesis, while generally safe, carries a small risk -- 0.5% -- of 
triggering a miscarriage, whereas ultrasound poses no known risk to the growing 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
However, doctors often recommend amniocentesis when routine blood tests given 
to pregnant women show elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. While many things 
can cause this protein to be higher than normal, there is a 1% chance that it 
means the baby has a defect. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston reviewed the 
ultrasound pictures of 51 fetuses with spina bifida and related abnormalities 
that were delivered or aborted at the hospital. In every case, ultrasound had 
correctly identified the birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers conclude that if a woman has an elevated alpha-fetoprotein 
level and a normal ultrasound scan, there is a less than a 0.1% chance that her 
baby will have spina bifida or a related birth defect.

FEARS GROW THAT DEVELOPERS MAY RAZE JERRY'S DELI; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIO CITY: THE OWNER WAS TOLD NOT TO WORRY, BUT A THREE- TO FOUR-STORY 
PROJECT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Development plans for the Ventura Boulevard site of Jerry's Famous Deli, known 
for its mixture of old-world kitsch and Hollywood glitz, have triggered intense 
speculation among neighbors who fear the landmark may be replaced by a large 
mixed-use project. 
</P>
<P>
The businessmen who control the development rights to the site approached 
officers of the Studio City Residents Assn. in July with proposals for a three- 
to four-story project that would include ground floor retail shops and three 
floors of apartments, according to association President Polly Ward. 
</P>
<P>
And in June, the developers renewed an effort to persuade the city to give up 
control of an adjacent street, Valleyheart Drive, which would enlarge the 
property by an acre and make the site even more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry's Deli owner Ike Starkman said real estate ads appearing to offer to sell 
the site and the petition for the city to vacate Valleyheart Drive have caused 
rumors to spread rapidly among business owners and patrons. But he said when he 
has confronted his landlords, "they have said to me nothing is happening and 
not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Starkman, who also owns the Jerry's in Encino, said he was anxious. He 
estimated that 23,000 customers, including entertainment industry celebrities, 
fill the 24-hour restaurant's bright red booths each week to munch on fare 
ranging from buffalo chicken wings to bagels and lox. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt about finding a new lease, but a place like this belongs to 
where it is," Starkman said. 
</P>
<P>
The developers include Robert Cohen, co-owner of the Four Seasons Hotel in 
Beverly Hills, and Francis Torino, a prominent Torrance builder. Jeff Lerman, 
Cohen's son-in-law and business associate, confirmed that he and Cohen have 
been meeting with homeowners about plans for the site, but he declined to 
discuss them further. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's a very sensitive situation," Lerman said. "We want to control 
what is said. The worst thing that can happen is that the wrong thing get 
said." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ward, public records and owners of businesses on and near the 
property, the partners appear to be piecing together a five- to seven-acre 
parcel at the prime location off Ventura Boulevard and Whitsett Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, Torino and Robert Schenkman own the ground leases to the land beneath 
Jerry's and the Studio City Sports Center, which includes tennis courts and a 
popular bowling alley. The sports center was originally run by actor Joe 
Kirkwood, who portrayed the comic strip character Joe Palooka in movies and 
television during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the partners paid a processing fee that revived a 6-year-old 
application to have the city give up its easement along a portion of 
Valleyheart Drive. The next step, according to the city engineer's office, is 
for the developers to submit a plan for a turnaround point for cars entering 
the remaining public portion of the street from Whitsett Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, an ordinance authorizing the change in the street's status 
will be submitted to the City Council for final approval. The council granted 
tentative approval to the plan in 1984, but the partners let the request remain 
idle until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate advertisements placed by a Cohen company this summer touted a 
"Spectacular S. California Development Opportunity." The ads offer a five- to 
seven-acre site on prime Ventura Boulevard in Studio City for $28 million. It 
could not be confirmed, however, that the ad referred to the Jerry's Deli site. 
</P>
<P>
Ward and others said they were told that the deli property may be sold to 
another group of developers instead of being built on by Cohen, Torino and 
Schenkman. 
</P>
<P>
The land is owned by the Weddington Investment Co. of North Hollywood, whose 
founders were among the San Fernando Valley's early land barons. But Cohen and 
his associates own the master lease on the approximately three-acre property. 
The lease, negotiated decades ago, allows them to control what is built or 
operated there, Barry Becker, a Weddington partner, said. 
</P>
<P>
Under current zoning regulations, three-story buildings are allowed along the 
section of Ventura Boulevard that includes the deli. A proposed specific plan 
for the 17-mile-long boulevard, however, would limit buildings to two stories 
in that section of the busy corridor. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed specific plan remains in draft form and is subject to change by 
the City Council. Mixed-use development, such as that reportedly envisioned by 
Cohen and his partners, would be encouraged along certain parts of the 
boulevard by offering developers incentives, such as exemptions from building 
fees, or allowances to build additional floor space. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, a Las Vegas builder, said he knew nothing about plans to change the 
site. A local Weddington partner, Guy McCreary, was out of town and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said that in February, Cohen, Torino and Schenkman purchased outright 
from a Weddington company an adjacent two acres on Ventura Boulevard. Three 
businesses -- Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Aaron Bros. Art Marts, and Express 
Carney's Limited, a hamburger stand inside an old railroad car -- now occupy 
that property. 
</P>
<P>
John Wolfe, owner of Carney's, said he was told by Schenkman that his lease, 
which expires in two years, will not be renewed "at this time." He was also 
told that the Cohen group is trying to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said he would reopen his restaurant elsewhere, if necessary, but that 
"you build up a reputation in an area like this and hate to move." 
</P>
<P>
"But one thing about what we have," he said in reference to the hot dog stand's 
railroad car, "is you can pick it up and move it."

<P>
POPULATION: WITH 40,000 FEWER PEOPLE THAN THE OFFICIAL COUNT, THE CITY COULD 
LOSE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND FEEL MORE PRO-GROWTH PRESSURE.

Santa Clarita officials, worried that a lower-than-expected federal estimate of 
the city's population could mean more development pressure and less money for 
the young municipality, say they will challenge a preliminary head count by the 
U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau reported last week that Santa Clarita's population is about 
107,000. But since its 1987 incorporation, the city has been using 147,000 -- a 
figure produced by the state and based on voter registration -- as its official 
population count. 
</P>
<P>
The far lower federal figure could provide ammunition for local developers to 
argue that land-use plans being assembled by both the city and Los Angeles 
County don't allow for enough residential construction. Government planners 
have used the higher figure to set tentative limits on how many residences can 
be built in the city and the surrounding Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative land-use plan being weighed by county officials envisions trying to 
hold the valley's population to about 270,000 by the year 2010. The city's 
plan, which also is not final, anticipates limiting growth to about 180,000 
people by the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said she is particularly concerned that the Census Bureau's 
figure, unless it is revised upwards, may encourage developers to push for more 
housing units in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have argued that developers in outlying unincorporated county 
areas are not paying their fair share for municipal services such as schools, 
roads and police. Although residents of developments outside the city limits 
pay no city taxes, they still use city services, Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been the hole in the doughnut," she said. "We're the hole and the 
county's the doughnut." 
</P>
<P>
Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land &amp; Farm Co., the major 
developer in the Santa Clarita Valley, said her firm has not studied the 
preliminary census figures closely. But if the lower federal figure is correct, 
she said, it would mean "there's definitely more room" for growth in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Census figures also are important to cities because they are used as a basis 
for divvying up millions of dollars in sales taxes, motor vehicle registration 
fees and other state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said if Santa Clarita's population is pegged at 40,000 less than what 
city officials now estimate, it would produce a shortfall of up to $500,000 in 
the city's $42-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city plans to undertake its own population count and intends 
to formally challenge the federal number. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Jill Klajic said "it's obvious to us" that the Census 
Bureau's early figure is incorrect, although she believes final census numbers 
will put the city's population somewhere between 121,000 and 137,000. 
</P>
<P>
The census "had so many internal problems and management problems out here, 
there were just whole tracts that they can't guarantee were counted in the 
first place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hugg, a Census Bureau spokesman, said census takers will conduct recounts 
in cities that have questioned the preliminary federal count, but he could not 
gauge the chances of Santa Clarita prevailing in its challenge. Final census 
figures will be issued by March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Early census numbers also showed that most San Fernando Valley cities 
experienced double-digit growth rates during the 1980s, especially newer cities 
at the Valley's northern and western edges. 
</P>
<P>
The most explosive growth occurred in the Antelope Valley area. Palmdale's 
population zoomed to 65,357 this year from 12,297 in 1980 -- a phenomenal 432% 
increase -- while the number of Lancaster residents jumped to 95,101 from 
48,027 in 1980, an increase of 98%. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills grew by 77%, as its upscale population jumped to 20,190 this year 
from 11,399 in 1980. San Fernando posted a 25% gain, while Westlake Village's 
population jumped 21%. Burbank grew by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
The only Valley city to lose population was tiny, affluent Hidden Hills, which 
dropped by 3%, or 45 residents.

100-ACRE FIRE SPREADS SOUTH OF GORMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campfire apparently sparked a brush fire that scorched at least 100 acres 
Sunday near Pyramid Reservoir in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 campers were evacuated from the Hard Luck Campground south of Gorman, 
but there were no injuries and no structures were threatened in the blaze that 
erupted about 11:40 a.m., said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Juanita Freel. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground and from the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was spreading slowly Sunday afternoon toward the northwest, near 
Snowy Creek, spokeswoman Susan Mockenhaupt said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the steep and rocky terrain near the creek made fighting the fire 
difficult, but said she expected decreased winds and temperatures and increased 
humidity during the night to help firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Graham said the blaze started when a 
stray spark from a campfire ignited a tent and flames spread to the surrounding 
brush.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer was in critical condition 
Sunday after suffering a heart attack during a foot chase in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dennis Healy, 29, collapsed about 7:20 p.m. Saturday as he chased a man 
who appeared to be under the influence of drugs near Van Nuys Boulevard and 
Ilex Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Healy's partner, Officer Fred Torres, said in a report that Healy fell 
unconscious, suffering from "full cardiac arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Healy was taken by ambulance to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and other officers later arrested Porfirio Castro, 18, on charges of 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
It was unknown if Healy had a history of heart trouble.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Van Nuys girl was kidnaped at gunpoint Sunday and raped, Los 
Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The girl told police a man forced her into his van at gunpoint near Sherman Way 
and Reseda Boulevard about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
She said the man raped her and left her near Mureau and Calabasas roads in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
She walked to a nearby school to call authorities. Sheriff's deputies found her 
at the school about 4 a.m. Sunday and contacted Los Angeles police. She was 
taken to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The man -- possibly an Asian in his mid-20s, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and 
weighing between 160 and 180 pounds -- drove a dark blue or gray van, said Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. William Weber.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 58 ARRESTED IN 8 HOURS IN DRUNK-DRIVER SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities arrested 58 people on suspicion of drunk driving during a weekend 
crackdown in the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A checkpoint at San Fernando Road and Del Sur Street, in operation from 6 p.m. 
Saturday until 2 a.m. Sunday, netted 36 people suspected of driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Roving patrols around San Fernando and Pacoima arrested another 22. Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. John Amott said police also arrested one person on suspicion of 
grand theft auto and another for possession of a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers who were arrested were charged under the mobile Immediate Booking and 
Release System. Under a law that took effect last month, police took away 
drivers' licenses and impounded cars. 
</P>
<P>
Amott said 1,015 vehicles passed through the checkpoint and 62 were stopped for 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown was a cooperative operation between the California Highway Patrol 
and Los Angeles and San Fernando police.

HOSPITAL PROGRAM BRINGS CLASSROOM TO TROUBLED YOUTHS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SOME DETEST SCHOOL, OTHERS ARE FURIOUS ABOUT BEING LOCKED UP. BUT 
TEENS ADMITTED TO A PORT HUENEME HOSPITAL FOR BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS 
LEARN THEY CAN'T PLAY HOOKY.

<P>
Sixteen-year-old Michelle was full of rage when she first walked into the 
schoolroom at Anacapa Adventist Hospital in Port Hueneme and counselors locked 
the door behind her. 
</P>
<P>
A runaway with drug problems, Michelle's parents shipped her, against her will, 
from their central California home to Anacapa for counseling and 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so mad," said Michelle, who has been at the private hospital for about 
four weeks. "I was outraged. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
But while Michelle undergoes treatment at the private hospital for adolescents, 
her time will not be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Along with up to 28 other school-age youths in the program, from all over 
California and beyond, Michelle is being educated while she is locked up. 
</P>
<P>
Anacapa officials asked that the full names of the students not be used to 
protect their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, under an agreement with the Oxnard Union High School District, 
has permanently assigned teacher Jerry Reed to the steady stream of students 
who come to Anacapa's single classroom from public and private schools as far 
away as Nevada, Colorado and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's challenge is daunting: to instruct ninth- through 12th-grade youngsters 
whose problems range from drug and alcohol abuse to eating disorders, 
depression, family problems and -- like Michelle when she first arrived -- 
outright hostility. 
</P>
<P>
"We get some very angry kids whose parents have tricked them in here," said 
Reed, whom the students affectionately call "Doc." More then 1,200 youths have 
been through Anacapa's program since it started in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was Jason Shoup, 19, now a supervisor with the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I came here, it was supposed to be for an hour, but I didn't 
stay for an hour," Shoup said. "I was tricked in." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, a Ventura High School student with drug problems who had run away from 
home in 1987, had called his mother and said he was ready to come back. She 
asked him to meet her at a nearby drugstore, and from there she drove him to 
Anacapa, where he had agreed to meet with a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, hospital workers locked the doors behind him and he ended up staying 
for 64 days. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Shoup eventually lapsed into his old habits, as some Anacapa 
students have done. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't use what I had learned," Shoup said. "I didn't follow the 
guidance that was given." 
</P>
<P>
He ended up back at Anacapa in 1988 -- this time voluntarily. The second time 
around, the training stuck. "Because I was more willing, I learned more," Shoup 
said. "The seed was planted." 
</P>
<P>
Now a student at Ventura College, Shoup supervises youths in the Anacapa 
program and assists Reed in the classroom, tutoring math. He said having been 
through the program helps him understand the anger and frustration of current 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the problems the students have outside the classroom, many dislike 
school and are not eager to spend the required four hours a day in the Anacapa 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"This is different from what they're accustomed to," Reed said of the 
year-round program. "They can't just show up and sit in the back of the room. 
They must come to class and do something to get credit." 
</P>
<P>
Reed receives a transcript from each of the students' home districts. During a 
conference when the student first arrives, he discusses what subjects are 
needed to help meet school requirements. Students are then assigned several 
subjects, given books and, under Reed's supervision, work at their own pace. 
</P>
<P>
Heather, a 17-year-old senior from Santa Barbara County, is studying earth 
science, world history and writing skills. A recovering alcoholic, she ended up 
at Anacapa after a drunken fight four months ago, during which she fell and 
broke her neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm behind in my credits badly and I'm making it up here," said Heather, who 
is out of a brace but still under a doctor's care. 
</P>
<P>
Many students flourish in the school portion of the program and, for the first 
time in their academic careers, begin to concentrate seriously on their 
studies, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, continue to resist studying. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 17, a former gang member from Las Vegas, said he feels his time would be 
better spent in counseling sessions than in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it, personally," said Ryan, who is studying world history. "I 
feel it's not helping me in my recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, a 17-year-old from Montecito, said he was also trying to concentrate on 
his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to get my life together, so while I'm here I'm not concentrating 
on the books," he said. "It's good to have school, though. It takes your mind 
off what we're going through." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Smith, director of student services at Oxnard Union High School 
District, said the district participates in the program because the students 
are residents of the district while they are at Anacapa and, under state law, 
are entitled to schooling while residing in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district also receives some state revenue for the students in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said the district started the program at the 
hospital's request. He said an additional teacher will be assigned to the 
48-bed facility this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"From a residential point of view it's an asset for parents looking for an 
appropriate place for their kids while they're going through these problems," 
Davis said. "Their educational program will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the Oxnard High School District was among the first in the state to 
provide a public schoolteacher at a private institution, shortly after a state 
law was passed allowing districts to claim revenue for students living 
temporarily in their districts, for medical or other reasons, and attending 
schools within the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Hueneme Elementary School District provides tutorial services to a much 
smaller number of younger students undergoing treatment at Anacapa. 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said it is 
not unusual to have public schoolteachers teaching in institutions, including 
hospitals. However, most specialized programs for students unable to attend 
regular school, such as programs for students who are incarcerated or 
bedridden, are run by county schools superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
David Smith, a psychiatrist who founded the Anacapa program, said two tracks 
are offered, one for youngsters with drug dependency problems and another for 
those with mental problems. The drug portion of the Anacapa program has a 
branch at the Van Nuys Psychiatric Hospital and a facility for adults in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said many of the parents whose children attend the program may 
unrealistically expect that, after a long summer, getting back to regular 
school will help their children straighten up. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids who have a problem have been out at the beach and partying . . . and 
getting loaded all summer," Smith said. "Parents are hoping school will turn 
them around." 
</P>
<P>
Often, he said, it doesn't happen. At Anacapa, when students are not in the 
classroom, they spend much of their time in group and family counseling 
sessions. They live in dormitory-like rooms at the hospital and, after several 
weeks, can earn passes to spend time away from the facility with family members 
or supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the cost of treatment can range from $10,000 to $15,000, depending 
on the illness and length of stay. In most cases, medical insurance helps cover 
the cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One Oxnard mother hopes that the program will help her 14-year-old daughter, 
Amber, cope with her drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Amber was admitted to Anacapa on Aug. 8 after she told a counselor at another 
program that she was carrying crack cocaine in her school backpack, said her 
mother, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said she hopes the program will keep her daughter from falling too 
far behind at her school, where fall classes have already started. She said the 
family's insurance will cover much of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"That they have a school was a real big consideration, not that I thought about 
it much at the time I admitted Amber," she said. "The program has been hard, 
but it's really wonderful."

SIMI VALLEY: IN 1980, MORE THAN 70% OF THE WORK FORCE COMMUTED ELSEWHERE TO 
EARN A LIVING. IN 1989, THE FIGURE WAS DOWN TO 60%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1980, Simi Valley launched an aggressive campaign aimed at attracting new 
business to boost economic development in what was and still is considered a 
bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the city has added 1.8 million square feet of 
commercial space and 5.3 million square feet of industrial facilities, 
resulting in an estimated 15,000 new jobs, said Assistant City Manager Jay 
Corey. 
</P>
<P>
The newly created jobs have had a significant effect on the number of residents 
who commute outside the city to work. In 1980, more than 70% of the work force 
in Simi Valley traveled to Los Angeles and elsewhere to earn a living. In 1989, 
with the city's population at more than 103,000, the number of those commuting 
to work was 60%, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for some, Simi Valley, which incorporated in 1969, is not progressing 
fast enough. When the east Ventura County city recently threatened to sue the 
city of Los Angeles to block a massive commercial and housing development in 
nearby Chatsworth, citing concerns about increased traffic and pollution, the 
issue of Simi Valley's own economic development was thrust into the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson charged that Simi Valley had failed to 
provide enough jobs for its own residents and should not complain about a 
development from which it would obviously benefit in terms of employment 
opportunities. Moreover, Bernson said Los Angeles was "sick and tired of 
supporting bedroom communities like Simi Valley and Santa Clarita" and 
suggested that Los Angeles impose an employment tax on those who come from 
outside the city to earn their living. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who works as an engineering manager at 
Teledyne Systems in Chatsworth, shrugged off Bernson's remarks as nothing more 
than an emotional reaction to Simi Valley's concerns over the planned Porter 
Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to ship some of his businesses to Simi Valley, we'll take them," 
Stratton said. "I'd love to pick up Teledyne and move the whole thing out to 
Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some San Fernando Valley firms have done just that. For example, 
Cardkey Systems Inc., with 220 employees, moved from Chatsworth to Simi Valley 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Wilson, senior marketing specialist with the security firm, said the 
company had shopped around the San Fernando Valley for a site on which to build 
before deciding on Simi Valley. He said it was simply cheaper to lease space in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Fernando Valley is becoming very expensive to run a business in," 
Wilson said. "Over the last few years, it has just skyrocketed." Wilson 
attributed the high cost of leasing space, in part, to the advent of Warner 
Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 30% of Cardkey's employees live in the San Fernando Valley, with 
the rest in Simi Valley and other parts of Ventura County. When the company 
announced it was going to move, he said, only two of its employees left because 
of the commute. 
</P>
<P>
Bugle Boy, a national clothing manufacturer, also made the move from Chatsworth 
to Simi Valley in 1989 for basically the same reason as Cardkey -- it was 
cheaper, said Genevieze Squires, a company official. Bugle Boy employs about 
500 people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides better land value, the city's location and quality of life have played 
a big part in attracting new businesses, city officials said. For example, Simi 
Valley is within 30 minutes of Burbank Airport and about an hour from Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Simi Valley has consistently been listed among the safest cities 
of its size in the state in terms of major crimes committed each year, 
according to FBI statistics. The city also enjoys the highest median household 
income in Ventura County at $48,700. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other businesses that have located in Simi Valley since 1980 
include Farmers Insurance Group; First Interstate Bancard Co.; Micom Systems 
Inc., a manufacturer of data communication systems; and Whittaker Corp., a 
manufacturer of air traffic control systems and radar tracking equipment. The 
Upjohn Co. also plans to build a plant in the city next year, and Volkswagen of 
America Inc. announced plans last week to open an automobile design center in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think collectively we have done a very good job" of attracting business, 
said Nancy Bender, executive director of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
"I think we have a very upscale and diverse type of industry, which was our 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we did not want to do is attract one type of industry, so if 
the market went soft in one area, it wouldn't be harmful to our economy." 
</P>
<P>
One such case in point is Gibraltar Savings, which established its corporate 
headquarters in the city in 1987, employing 800 people. The savings and loan 
had plans to expand its offices and increase its work force to 3,000 employees 
before it fell into federal receivership last year.

In June, Security Pacific Bank purchased some of Gibraltar Savings' assets. 
However, the savings and loan's Simi Valley office is still being operated 
under the supervision of federal regulators, and it is uncertain what will 
happen to the property. 
</P>
<P>
Despite disappointment over Gibraltar Savings, the city continues to move 
forward. Corey said that while the city in the past has concentrated on 
attracting industry, the emphasis is shifting toward commercial, with the 
primary goal being to construct a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, the nation's second-largest shopping center 
developer, has proposed building a $200-million mall on a 60-acre site just 
north of the Simi Valley Freeway, between 1st Street and Erringer Road. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has said it hopes to open the two-level mall, which would include 
five department stores, by the end of 1993. In addition to providing hundreds 
of jobs, the mall is expected to generate an estimated $3 million in annual 
revenues for the city. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide a significant boost to the city's current sales tax revenue, 
which was reported at $6.7 million for the 1989-90 fiscal year. As in most 
cities, such revenues are Simi Valley's single largest source of income to pay 
for such city services as street maintenance and fire and police protection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic benefits, Stratton said the mall will serve as a 
focal point for the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall seems to be part of our culture," Stratton said. "It's like the 
downtown of old Midwestern towns. It is a necessary part of your city. It 
provides a feeling that the city is complete." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is looking forward to the opening of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, which is expected to attract 250,000 to 300,000 visitors 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The library, which is being built on 100 acres of unincorporated land at the 
southwest end of the city, is scheduled to open in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Reagan Library will be very beneficial to our economy," Bender 
said. "It will bring a steady flow of people to visit and in turn they will 
spend their money in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Bender said the Chamber of Commerce already uses the library in its promotional 
campaigns to lure companies to Simi Valley. In addition, she said a book 
promoting the city and the library will be published next year, to coincide 
with the opening, and will be distributed at bookstores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"When something that noteworthy locates in a community, people will want to 
become more familiar with the community," Bender said. The library, she 
predicted, is going to "make a major change in the perception, and interest, in 
Simi Valley. It's going to be rather awesome." 
</P>
<P>
So is it still fair to refer to Simi Valley as a bedroom community? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't refer to it that way anymore," Bender said. "Maybe 10 years ago, 
but not now. I think we have too much activity here. I think we have started to 
come out of that era." 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, on the other hand, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably still is a little bit" of a bedroom community, he said. But, he 
added, "we try not to think of ourselves that way."

TAKASUGI PREPARES FOR COSTLY CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: TWO YEARS AGO, OXNARD'S MAYOR RAISED MORE THAN $160,000 AND OUTSPENT 
HIS CLOSEST RIVAL BY $90,000. HE MAY FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH THIS YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
When Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi was recently asked how much money he intends to 
raise in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term in office, he said: "Whatever 
it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
That statement sent a disquieting message to his challengers, who remember how 
Takasugi surpassed the city's spending record two years ago by raising more 
than $160,000 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
During that race, the mayor outspent his closest rival by $90,000. In fact, his 
campaign expenditures were more than double those of each candidate in that 
year's Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still reeling from it," said Councilman Manuel Lopez, who spent $55,000 -- 
including $10,000 from his own pocket -- in an unsuccessful bid to unseat 
Takasugi. 
</P>
<P>
Although Takasugi hopes he will not have to spend as much this year, he faces 
five candidates who "are going to take shots at me from every direction." 
</P>
<P>
"To counter those points, I'm going to have to use some means, and that 
requires some money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His challengers agree that money will play an important role in this year's 
election. They also acknowledged that it will be hard to beat Takasugi, whose 
experience includes two years on the Planning Commission and four years as a 
councilman before becoming mayor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is important because you have to have some means to communicate to the 
voters and there is no substitute for the media," said Scott Bollinger, a 
self-employed investor. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who is considered Takasugi's most serious 
challenger, agreed. "Money does play a big part in the race and it should not 
be underestimated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Takasugi spent more than $61,000 on literature, including 2,800 lawn 
signs, 10,000 personalized letters and about 80,000 mailers. Nearly $10,000 was 
spent on postage, $4,420 on newspaper advertising and about $3,300 for 
broadcast advertising. Another $14,000 went to John Davies, his Santa 
Barbara-based campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the remaining $70,000 or so went to pay for overhead costs 
of running the campaign, such as telephone and electric bills. A smaller 
portion went toward the cost of producing several surveys and fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
The race put Takasugi $19,404 in debt, according to a campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said that during the final days of the 1988 campaign, Oxnard residents 
were "constantly seeing Takasugi's picture and his name, and no matter what 
anybody says, that is power." 
</P>
<P>
Another 1988 mayoral candidate, Paul K. Dolan, who now is managing Bollinger's 
campaign, said Takasugi "bombarded everyone with image rather than substance." 
</P>
<P>
Then-Councilman Michael Plisky, who spent almost $70,000 on his campaign 
against Takasugi, lost by almost 5,000 votes. Takasugi surpassed Lopez by about 
9,000 votes and trounced Dolan by almost 14,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign statements, the lion's share of Takasugi's money came 
from construction firms, real estate brokers and developers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the donations of more than $1,000 came from developers like the 
Darrik Marten Co. of Ventura, the Martin V. Smith Co. of Oxnard, the Sammis Co. 
of Irvine and the William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While Takasugi received a small portion of his money in the form of donations 
under $100, most of it came from donations in the $200-to-$500 range. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan and Bollinger questioned Takasugi's integrity for taking such large 
contributions from developers. They suggested that developers have given to 
Takasugi's race in exchange for preferential treatment when they need approval 
of development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Money has become the central issue in getting candidates elected, as opposed 
to issues," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Davies called such allegations ridiculous and said that almost every candidate 
in the 1988 election received donations from developers. He said developers 
traditionally make large donations in Oxnard because they have a genuine 
concern for the community. 
</P>
<P>
A major portion of Takasugi's money was generated at two $100-a-plate 
fund-raising dinners at the Tower Club in Oxnard. "The Tower Club was a great 
fund-raiser," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the 22-story Union Bank Building, the Tower Club has recently been the 
site of fund-raising parties for gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The club's membership includes Takasugi; Police Chief Robert Owens; Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury; Martin V. Smith, president of the development company of 
the same name; and John Gilbert, president of the TOLD Real Estate Corp., one 
of the county's largest development firms. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Takasugi spent about $43,000 on his 1986 mayoral campaign. He 
said he decided to raise extra funds for his 1988 campaign because Plisky 
announced early in the race that he would raise at least $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We said if that is the case, we need to raise some money too," Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, before she announced her intention to challenge Takasugi, 
Maron proposed that council members informally agree to place limits on how 
much they spend on their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who researched the issue for the council, 
said that laws limiting spending are unconstitutional because they violate the 
First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Maron suggested limiting spending to 50 cents per voter, or about $23,000 per 
campaign. The suggestion prompted adamant opposition from Takasugi, who said 
such limits would infringe on his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not give up my constitutional right to what I can do to keep my seat in 
office," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Takasugi suggested that Maron made the proposal 
because she wanted to place some restraints on his campaign, an allegation 
Maron denies. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger acknowledges that there is little hope of outspending Takasugi this 
year. "He's done it in the past and I don't see a reason why he can't do it 
now," Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he and Maron both believe they can beat the mayor in November by 
campaigning strongly on the city's financial problems and the pace of current 
development. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bollinger has already begun his attack on Takasugi in an advertisement 
he has put in three newspapers. The ad includes a photo of Bollinger and a 
headline that reads "Bollinger 'Tackles' Takasugi in Run for Oxnard Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Dolan said Bollinger will offer himself as the "alternative candidate" and 
hopes to ride into office on a wave of anti-incumbency feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Maron, who said she spent about $11,500 on her last reelection bid, said she 
also hopes to promote a "controlled-growth" development policy and focus her 
campaign on solving the city's recent financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been there for eight years and has talked about growth being good," she 
said. "But how come we still have money problems?" 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi's camp is not taking this year's challenge lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next two weeks, Davies said Takasugi will have 15 to 20 full-time 
volunteers soliciting donations and planning campaign strategy. Davies said he 
will advise the mayor to promote his strongest asset: his experience in City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has better experience," Davies said.

OXNARD ISSUE: WOULD GUIDELINES ALLOW TOO MUCH GROWTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard's proposed new General Plan, designed to guide development for 30 years, 
has been criticized on the grounds it would allow excessive population growth. 
The plan envisions 
</P>
<P>
the city's 41,857 dwellings increasing to 55,319, a 32% boost. The population 
might swell by 41,000. Commercial development could grow by 130%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Maulhardt 
</P>
<P>
vice president of business development and government relations for the Oxnard 
Chamber of Commerce 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it causes too much growth. I think it's a very restrictive plan 
because it has a lot of development controls and periodic reviews of 
relationships between 
</P>
<P>
industrial development and housing. The law requires that you do a general plan 
based on a worst-case scenario. It estimates growth at the fastest possible 
rate that can be thought of, along with the maximum number of jobs produced and 
maximum number of automobile trips. By using all those worst-case maximums you 
get a document that looks a little scary. But what happens in real life isn't 
worst case. Real life moves a lot slower. I think the proposed plan is very 
similar to the plan we've been operating under. That plan could probably be in 
place another 10 years before it built out what was estimated. This plan 
overestimates what will happen because the market will not require the kind of 
development the plan theoretically could allow. There's a lot of stuff in the 
current plan that is still undone. The same thing will happen with this one. It 
projects a certain amount of growth, but probably only about 75% will be 
realized over that 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scott Weiss 
</P>
<P>
candidate for Oxnard City Council and founder of Citizens to Protect Oxnard, a 
slow-growth organization 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely! From 1980 to 1987 Oxnard averaged 420 new houses a year. This 
General Plan will add approximately 1,000 new homes a year for the next 10 
years. It also 
</P>
<P>
will call for a 134% increase in commercial development and 312% increase in 
industrial development. Industrial and commercial development will attract more 
people to the area, causing the prices of houses to rise. The General Plan 
reflects the pro-growth attitude of the current City Council. In fact, this 
General Plan would make Oxnard the only city in Ventura County without growth 
limits. It will have very negative impacts on the quality of life in Oxnard and 
Ventura County. We will see more crime, more traffic, overcrowded classrooms, 
more smog, increased infrastructure costs and water problems. We will also see 
destruction of prime agricultural land and our beaches and wetlands. Without 
specific growth limits, the City Council will be free to continue the rampant 
development we have seen recently. I would like to see more concern for the 
quality of life for our community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sue Chadwick 
</P>
<P>
chairwoman of Oxnard's Economic Development Advisory Board 
</P>
<P>
No. First there is the managed growth element that's in the plan itself that 
says growth cannot occur if development doesn't support it and pay its way. In 
other words, 
</P>
<P>
infrastructure has to be in place -- the development pays for all of that. The 
thing I like about it is that it's monitored by City Council on an annual 
basis, so that makes me feel like there's not going to be too much growth. The 
plan is specific. It says that residential will be phased in, so that's 
positive. Without the infrastructure being there, it won't get approved as I 
understand it. Another reason I say no is that there is this perception that 
Oxnard is growing like Orange County. That's just not true. During the last 15 
years, growth has averaged between 1.4% and 2.2% in Oxnard. That's less than 
other cities that have a growth cap or a no-growth plan in place. Development 
brings in needed revenue to keep this community viable. I don't think we should 
lose sight of that either. A community needs to keep growing. Not that it has 
to grow by leaps and bounds, but there still needs to be that economic 
development that takes place to be viable and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard Maggio 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's community development director 
</P>
<P>
No. The rate of growth in the General Plan that is proposed over the next 30 
years is actually slightly less than what has occurred over the previous 10. In 
terms of 
</P>
<P>
housing growth, the city of Oxnard increased 1.63% per year during the last 10 
years. This was less than the county's average of 2.39%. Although we are the 
largest city in the county, the city ranked sixth in terms of annual housing 
growth behind Moorpark, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ventura. The 
General Plan for the next 30 years anticipates similar amounts of increase and 
also projects there will be less growth on an annual basis than what was 
experienced in the past. Also, the city continues to remain in third place in 
terms of growth in retail sales. . . . The plan does propose to try and bring 
the city to its commercial potential in proportion to its size. A new greenbelt 
is being proposed -- meaning no development would occur -- between Patterson 
and Harbor Boulevard. That further restricts where we can grow because the 
greenbelts will have set those limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rodney Fernandez 
</P>
<P>
executive director of Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
I think it allows too much growth. It's not consistent with the wishes of the 
majority of the people in the community. I don't think the process included 
enough low-income people 
</P>
<P>
in terms of participation. The key to success is to have a general plan for 
Oxnard that clearly provides a balanced mix of housing. Twenty percent should 
be for low-income families and 30% should be for moderate-income families. And 
that's a minimum. To develop goals for housing you have to look at the makeup 
of the community and what's been done in the last 10 years. What the City 
Council keeps forgetting is that the strength of Oxnard is in its mix of 
people. The thing that makes that community viable economically is that it has 
a broad mix of income roots. They're in a fallacy if they continue to develop 
the majority of their housing in the higher-income spectrum. They're going to 
have labor and economic problems which are already surfacing. The Chamber of 
Commerce has been working for a couple of years to get a more balanced housing 
program, but it really hasn't been supported by the staff or council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everett Millais 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's community development director 
</P>
<P>
We have some real concerns about the scope of the growth, about their 
jobs/housing balance, and about some of the things the plan seems to indicate 
in 
</P>
<P>
terms of air quality or agriculture -- that there's really no significant 
adverse environmental effects. We disagree with that. The plan now being 
considered since the city of Ventura made its comments in January provides for 
annual monitoring of housing and employment by Oxnard's city staff. One of our 
concerns was that that would get out of balance and provide more jobs than 
housing. If they do that kind of monitoring, that will help. But I have some 
real concerns about the overall increases proposed, if they come to pass. They 
seem to indicate that since their population is projected within the limits set 
by the county air quality plan, there is no significant air quality impact. We 
really disagree with that. There are air quality impacts now, and to add that 
kind of additional population will have substantial adverse impacts in our 
opinion . . .. Most of this additional growth will go on prime agricultural 
land. That's something that really can't be mitigated either. JANE HULSE

ANARCHY IN THE MONARCHY?;

ROYALTY: THE ANTICS OF THE YOUNG ROYALS HAVE PALACE WATCHERS WONDERING IF THEY 
CAN LIVE UP TO THEIR STATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's Royal Family has resorted to disguises and aliases to evade the 
prying lenses of the press, but two of its most controversial members have just 
walked into a photographic storm with their eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, and his wife, Sarah, invited a 
photographer into their home to take a set of informal pictures, complete with 
birthday party scenes and beachwear shots. 
</P>
<P>
The photo exclusive of the couple, the Duke and Duchess of York, and their two 
young daughters filled 48 pages of a recent edition of Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But the royal snapshots, accompanied by an article titled "Delightful Moments 
at Home with the Yorks," provoked criticism from friends and foes of the 
monarchy, who accused the couple of making a tasteless show of their private 
life. 
</P>
<P>
It also stoked a long-running debate over whether the more fashionable royals 
damage or strengthen the monarchy by their mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The episode is the latest in a series of controversies surrounding the younger 
members of the Royal Family who, in breaking with protocol to make the monarchy 
more accessible, have sometimes been accused of lacking the dignity demanded by 
their high station in life. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, was panned three years ago when 
he persuaded a group of royals to dress up in period costumes and lead teams in 
a televised charity contest. 
</P>
<P>
Flame-haired Sarah, nicknamed "Fergie" after her maiden name of Ferguson, was 
one of those taking part. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has faced more criticism over her spending habits, her 
ranch-style house -- dubbed "Palace Dallas" by British newspapers -- and for 
wearing short skirts that reveal too much royal leg when she gets in and out of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, traditionalists were horrified when Princess Diana, wife of 
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, was caught giving her chauffeur a goodby 
kiss on the cheek after a holiday in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the royals to keep their dignity with the tabloid press 
around. A newspaper once ran a story titled: "20 Things You Did Not Know About 
Prince Charlie's Bald Spot." 
</P>
<P>
Other controversial photographs have surfaced, including one of a pregnant 
Princess Diana in a skimpy bikini. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things added together are leading to a crisis in the monarchy," said 
Harold Brooks-Baker, champion of royal tradition and editor of Britain's 
nobility directory, Burke's Peerage. "If this carries on, it will come 
unstuck." 
</P>
<P>
He was highly critical of the Yorks. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for an ordinary person, these photographs would be unacceptable," he 
said. "Who would want to show pictures of their wife in a sun-dress to anyone 
but very close friends?" 
</P>
<P>
The photographs are no different from average family snapshots. But some 
Britons take offense at the idea of one of the queen's sons and his wife being 
photographed frolicking in a pool and feeding the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess was snapped changing her baby daughter Eugenie's diapers and 
rubbing suntan lotion on 2-year-old Beatrice, who romped naked by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the public was not allowed to see inside the royal households. 
When Queen Elizabeth first admitted the television cameras, her family was clad 
in traditional tweeds and tartans. 
</P>
<P>
Hello editor Maggie Goodman said typical English prudery and snobbery were 
behind the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The public was snapping up copies of the magazine, she said, and newspapers 
that criticized the photographs were just jealous of Hello's exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper said the prince and his wife, the daughter of a polo coach, came 
across like tourists on a cheap holiday. Even the right-leaning Daily Telegraph 
admonished the couple. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice is that the Royal Family should equip themselves with an intelligent 
public relations operator without further delay before irreparable harm is done 
to the monarchy," wrote the Telegraph's Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Family could hardly complain about snooping reporters if they made 
their private lives public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew is no fan of the press. In his bachelor days, he was caught 
vacationing with an actress friend despite traveling under an assumed name. He 
once threw paint over the paparazzi and had to make a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why the couple agreed to the photo session. Goodman said they 
just wanted to share their wedded bliss with the world. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics have spoken of a big fee, a claim firmly denied by Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace, in keeping with royal tradition, offered its customary "no 
comment."

FESTIVAL KICKS OFF WITH FEAST OF MIXTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first day of the Los Angeles Festival concluded with Japanese theater and 
American jazz -- an eclectic mix that seemed to fit what the festival's all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
The "Legend of the Water Flame," a contemporary piece drawn from an old 
Japanese legend, premiered Saturday night at the Japan America Theater. 
Afterwards, guests strolled the plaza in the cool night air, queued for a rich 
dessert buffet and listened to the Red Callendar trio play jazz classics. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exquisite," said festival director Peter Sellars of "Legend." "I know 
it's going to haunt me for the next couple of days, it's going to come back to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Sellars and thousands of others had gone south to San Pedro 
for opening-day ceremonies, launching 16 days of theater, music, dance, video, 
ethnic rituals and performance-art pieces featuring artists from the Pacific 
Rim. 
</P>
<P>
That day's ceremonies "moved some people to tears," said Sellars at the 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so shocking and moving to see these people perform. Audiences were again 
and again moved. The performers are so open and emotionally direct and American 
audiences hunger for that pure humanity. There's nothing synthetic there -- 
it's all completely authentic." 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Sellars, his spikey dark-blond hair standing at attention like 
new-mown grass, wore a baggy gold plaid tunic and pants he said he had bought 
that day from the African Marketplace at one of the festival sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought, like, three of these," he said. "It's the only place I'm going to 
shop from now on." 
</P>
<P>
Although the audience responded warmly to "Legend" (performed in Japanese with 
some English translation projected on a backdrop), others were caught napping 
through parts, only to be awakened by loud percussion. 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Rachel Rosenthal was enthusiastic about the piece, saying: 
"I was particularly moved by the actress." Rosenthal seemed pleased that her 
Los Angeles Festival shows were almost sold out, adding that she hoped the 
festival would broaden her audience. 
</P>
<P>
Guests were presented with festival pins, which some immediately affixed to 
lapels. They also received navy-and-white Japanese head wraps, which some tied 
around their heads or turned into kerchiefs, shawls or handbag accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speech-givers at the reception were AT&amp;T vice president Jerry 
Arca, festival board chairman Maureen Kindel, Mayor Tom Bradley, Japanese 
American Cultural and Community Center executive director Gerald Yoshitomi and 
film director James Bridges.

<TEXT>
<P>
A new anti-hate-crime program called "L.A. Cares," launched by the 
International Institute of Los Angeles, will help victims recover from racial, 
ethnic and religious incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The program will provide grants of up to $500 in cases where such funds can 
contribute to the victim's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Roberto Andreos says the grants are small, but does 
"demonstrate that our community does care and will support a stand against 
cowardly bullie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Cares is the nation's second program of its kind. The first, launched in 
Boston, has become an important asset for individuals and organizations damaged 
by hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The International Institute of Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization, founded 
in 1914, is dedicated to helping immigrants, refugees, the foreign born and 
their children achieve economic and social self-sufficiency. Information: (213)

NAVAJOS DEFEND REDFORD'S CASTING OF PHILLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization representing Navajo Indians has come to the defense of Robert 
Redford's casting of Lou Diamond Phillips as a Navajo policeman in "The Dark 
Wind," which came under fire late last week. 
</P>
<P>
The casting of Phillips, who is part Cherokee, was protested by the American 
Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, according to a wire-service report 
from Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo tribe's capital, where the film will begin 
shooting next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Phillips, who is featured as a Navajo-Mexican in the current 
"Young Guns II," will play patrolman Jim Chee in the film based on New Mexico 
author Tony Hillerman's novel. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Paradise, director of the registry, was reported to be planning to meet 
with Redford and Phillips within the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Redford has bought the (rights to several) books from Mr. Hillerman and 
knowing there are other films down the line that follow the same story line, we 
are concerned," Paradise was reported as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Navajo Nation said Friday that it was "sympathetic to the concerns of the 
American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, but we have already 
established a working relationship with the filmmakers and will assist them in 
any way to complete the 'Dark Wind' film. 
</P>
<P>
"The producers . . . choose actors they feel will promote their production," 
said LeNora Begay, press officer for the Navajo Nation. "However, we as a 
tribal government cannot oppose their decisions. All we ask is that they be 
sensitive to our needs, culture and language in making films based on the 
Navajo." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' publicist, Eddie Michaels, suggested that the controversy came about 
because of Redford's stated intent that he would find a full-blooded Native 
American for the leading roles. "Lou is a victim of casting," Michaels said. 
Philips was in a local hospital recovering from complications of a 
tonsillectomy and unavailable for comment, Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
A production executive for "The Dark Wind" said that another leading role in 
the film will be played by actor Gary Farmer, who is a full-blooded Mohawk. 
Navajos will be cast in a number of other roles, he said.

THE SHADOW FIGURES IN WAYANG KULIT TALES

JOGJAKARTA, Central Java 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bell-like shimmer of the palace gamelan still reverberates in the warm 
night air, but Wayang Kulit puppeteer Radyo Harsono has already lit a cigarette 
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two hours, he's provided the motion, voice and spirit of a whole 
company of flat, leather shadow-figures, dramatizing an episode from the Hindu 
epic "Mahabharata" on a translucent 6 1/2-by-10-foot cloth screen. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Harsono says that he much prefers the traditional all-night Wayang 
Kulit performances but that this abridged version is the one he'll do most 
often on the "Court Art of Jogjakarta" tour of the United States from late 
August to early October. (The shortened program opens Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the 
Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, as part of the Los Angeles Festival, 
with a repeat on Sept. 11. A 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. marathon is scheduled for 
Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
Harsono worries that the language problem and other cultural barriers may pose 
difficulties in America and has considered learning a little English to insert 
in the clown scenes -- normally in the vernacular as opposed to the classical 
Javanese spoken by the noble characters and gods. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, he is younger than most dalangs (puppeteers) and highly thoughtful about 
the responsibilities of his profession. "It can be explaining something to the 
society," he says, "or passing on philosophy, or entertaining. There are many 
things you have to do, like fasting, as part of your overall need as a person 
taking on the role of dalang." 
</P>
<P>
"In the villages," he explains, "people have a strong belief that the dalang 
can help with non-physical healing. If someone has a baby during a performance, 
they will make it his godchild, and he is supposed to aid the child's 
education." Harsono has two godchildren of this sort. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences in Java go to see a particular dalang rather than just a play and are 
free to watch the performance from either in front of the shadow-screen or 
backstage, where they can appreciate how he manipulates, on rods, dozens of 
elaborately painted and incised puppets while also speaking, singing, supplying 
sound-effects and cuing the gamelan. 
</P>
<P>
Since there isn't a set script, the dalang must also be able to improvise 
within traditional performing conventions -- and Harsono lists "knowledge of 
music, dance, the visual arts, the vocal arts, literature and philosophy" as 
necessary for success in this career. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to concentrate beforehand on the story," he says -- "on how 
you want it to go." Since he performs up to 20 times a month, there's also 
another essential in this vital, 9th-Century performance idiom: 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be healthy," Harsono says with a laugh. "You have to really guard 
your health."

JAVANESE COURT PROVIDES DELICIOUS INTERPRETATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So much to see, so little time. "The Court Art of Java" so dazzles us with its 
revelations about Jogjakarta classical tradition, we remember the helpless awe 
we felt the first time we visited a library, a museum -- any place where the 
artifacts of a culture stood in intimidating profusion before us. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us spent much of the company's second Los Angeles Festival program, 
Saturday at the Arboretum, trying to learn the rudiments of palace dance drama, 
where merely entering and leaving the stage formed an illuminating ritual: 
</P>
<P>
Repeated continually during the evening, the process involved the dancers 
kneeling just inside the playing area and then concentrating or meditating (or 
establishing a point of focus) before slightly inclining their heads -- 
"switching themselves on or off" in the description of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Another textbook for American neophytes: the feet of principal dancer Y. 
Surojo. Watch the infinite expressive choices they reveal and especially how 
they appear to merely brush (barely touch) the floor as he dances -- the 
technique of using denial of weight and extreme turnout to shape an ideal of 
male refinement. 
</P>
<P>
Surojo's nobility and Jogjakartan male prowess proved central to the Wayang 
Wong version of "Arjuna Wiwaha" (Arjuna's Wedding), a narrative retold three 
different ways in the company's touring repertory. Cast in the title role, 
Surojo played someone aloof from worldly strife yet needed to restore divine 
order. 
</P>
<P>
In the Friday Bedhaya version, women symbolized the characters and issues of 
this drama -- and fought battles of their own in another piece that night. On 
Saturday, however, they merely decorated the action -- except for a major 
choreographic set piece early on. Here, as Surojo sat meditating on a bench, 
(his right hand diagonally crossing his chest to touch his left shoulder), 
seven "celestial nymphs" hovered over him, softly rising and sinking, their 
beckoning hands inches from his face. 
</P>
<P>
The sung text tells us that "they pose and posture, tempting him each in her 
way; some toss a flower, some a teasing smile, but the hermit's heart is firm. 
. . ." However, choreographer R. Rio Sasminta Mardawa and his dancers went much 
further than that, creating a kind of holographic illusion of temptation: the 
perfume of it rather than anything we recognized as living women. 
</P>
<P>
Among the platoons of gods, demons, heroes and comic servants who inevitably 
lost stature or complexity in the two abridgement-for-export being performed, 
we glimpsed major artists making delicious interpretive choices. As the fierce 
Mamangmurka, for example, the masked dancer Sunartomo added an edge of sweet, 
comic bewilderment to his character's vicissitudes -- especially the moment 
when Mamangmurka realized he'd been transformed into a wild boar. ("Moi?") 
</P>
<P>
If some of us thought of Bottom in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at this point -- 
or the "white" acts of 19th-Century ballets during the women's temptation 
ensemble -- please forgive our Eurocentric impurity. Wayang Wong makes us 
reconsider the principles and achievements of Western classical tradition by 
showing us a luminous alternative. Immediately engaging as dance-spectacle, it 
repays the closest attention any of us can give.

A TRIPLE TREAT: DONEGAN, WILSON AND REEVES AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A triple treat of jazz music was served up in healthy doses Saturday night by a 
triple threat of jazz talent at L.A. Jazz '90, the third such festival 
presented by the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Though the crowd at UCLA's Royce Hall was small, those in attendance were 
treated to a pair of legends (Dorothy Donegan, Gerald Wilson) and a 
legend-in-the-making (Dianne Reeves), each of whom demonstrated his or her 
crafts with style and originality. 
</P>
<P>
The opening set was provided by Donegan, whose lusty, hard-swinging piano style 
can turn a ditty like "Tea for Two" into a mainstream jazz masterpiece. At 66, 
she's not lost one iota of her drive, spirit or imagination, as she capably 
demonstrated during a too-short set that included a simple blues that grew into 
a rollicking boogie-woogie, with enough musical quotes and references to fill 
an encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, what was lost to the audience was the verbal side of Donegan. 
Working inexplicably without a microphone, her asides and frequent outbursts 
didn't reach past the first few rows. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, whose range of musical styles is as broad as her vocal range (three and 
a half octaves), stuck to jazz during a brief set that left the audience 
wanting for more. Opening with Cole Porter's "Love for Sale," Reeves embarked 
on a seven-minute excursion into the song's jazz potential, leaving no stone 
unturned. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, who was reunited with pianist Billy Childs and bassist Tony Dumas for 
this event, worked beautifully with the band as they explored a pair of ballads 
("Softly as in a Morning Sunrise," "For All We Know") and a magnificently 
rendered "The Nearness of You." Her closing number, the Max Roach-Abbey Lincoln 
opus, "Freedom Day," was a vocal tour de force and a fine showcase for the 
exceptional drumming talents of Terry Lynn Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilson, whose Orchestra of the '90s was given the closing spot, proved 
as capable a promoter/instructor as he is a composer/arranger. The 
septuagenarian Wilson, whose career has spanned most of the history of the 
music, discomforted with his eagerness to point out his own achievements. 
</P>
<P>
But the music soared and familiar tunes like "Blues for YNA," "Teri" and 
"Jenna" showcased not only the leader's talent but also those of his 17-man 
orchestra, especially those of trumpeter Oscar Brashear, whose reading of 
"Carlos" was simply mesmerizing.

TENNIS: MANUELA MALEEVA-FRAGNIERE UPSETS U.S. OPEN'S SECOND-SEEDED WOMAN, 7-5, 
3-6, 6-3.

<P>
So how big an upset was it? 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth round of the U.S. Open Sunday night, Wimbledon champion Martina 
Navratilova lost to Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, who isn't even the best player 
in her family. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva-Fragniere, ranked No. 9, two places behind sister Katerina, shocked the 
No. 2-ranked Navratilova, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably what I have lived for in my tennis career," Maleeva-Fragniere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova reacted differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Wimbledon took so much out of me," she said. "I wanted to be up, but I 
couldn't quite kick it in gear." 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it Maleeva-Fragniere's first victory over Navratilova in eight 
matches and Navratilova's worst Open in 10 years, it also sunk Navratilova into 
such a depression she hinted she might retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the desire will ever be 100%," Navratilova said. "If I don't 
feel like playing next year, I won't. If I do, I will. 
</P>
<P>
"No headlines 'Martina Retiring Next Year,' . . . but anything's possible," she 
said. "I had a very good chance to win this tournament and I blew it." 
</P>
<P>
No one could dispute her version. Navratilova made only 55% of her first 
serves, made 37 unforced errors, got passed at the net as if she were standing 
still and lost more than half of the points when she came to the net. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a thoroughly miserable performance, which Navratilova freely 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"I wimped out," said Navratilova, who managed to find a bright side: "I guess I 
get to see some plays here now." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova and partner Gigi Fernandez are still alive in the doubles draw, but 
it's the bottom half of the singles draw that is looking pretty sick right now. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is third-seeded Monica Seles gone, so too is the second-seeded 
Navratilova, which leaves the bottom half open for about everybody but the 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner might be Gabriela Sabatini, seeded fifth, who will meet 
Leila Meskhi in the quarterfinals. Sabatini won her fourth-round match over 
Helena Sukova, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Joe Fernandez, who defeated Judith Weisner, 6-3, 6-2, will play 
Maleeva-Fragniere in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's fortunes changed early. She led the first set, 4-1, 40-15, but 
wound up losing the set. In the third set, she was serving at 1-1, 40-15 and 
lost, held a break point for 2-2 and lost. Trailing 2-3 and desperately needing 
to break Maleeva-Fragniere, Navratilova lost at love. 
</P>
<P>
"I got myself into a pretty good hole there and couldn't get it back," 
Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva-Fragniere served for the match at 5-2 and felt the pressure. She won 
two points, but Navratilova was only delaying the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
On match point, Navratilova stood flat-footed at the baseline and pushed an 
easy forehand that struck the top of the net, bounced back and began rolling 
toward her feet. 
</P>
<P>
The match was over. Maleeva-Fragniere ran to the stands and hugged her husband, 
Francoise, while Navratilova silently packed her bags. 
</P>
<P>
They had played here in last year's quarterfinals and Navratilova won, 6-0, 
6-0, in 44 minutes. However, Maleeva-Fragniere said she was not worried before 
her match this time. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I was thinking it's about time I beat a good player in a Grand Slam," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova thought the percentages might have caught up with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I should lose to people before I go into the Open," Navratilova said. 
"I've never lost to her before, so I guess this was a bad time to do it."

NL PRESIDENT THREATENS TO RESIGN;

BASEBALL: WITHOUT A STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FROM VINCENT ON THE UMPIRE DISPUTE, 
BILL WHITE SAYS HE CANNOT HEAD THE LEAGUE.

National League president Bill White threatened to resign if Commissioner Fay 
Vincent doesn't give him full support in his dispute with the league's umpires, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the commissioner to get the facts, and then I want a statement from the 
commissioner. This is a time to take a stand, to find out who's right and 
wrong, who's telling the truth and who's lying," White said in Sunday's 
Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't receive the full support of baseball's highest officer, White 
said, "It's goodby. I'm going home." 
</P>
<P>
He also challenged Richie Phillips, the head of the umpire's union, over their 
contradicting accounts of a meeting last week with umpire Joe West. 
</P>
<P>
"If Richie is right and I'm lying, I should resign as president of the National 
League," White said. "If I'm right and he's lying, Richie should resign. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have lied I shouldn't be allowed to hold this office. If he has lied, 
(then) in my role as president of the National League, I can't deal with him. 
Our jobs should be on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who met with White on Friday, did not want to say much about the 
matter. "I'm trying to be helpful," he said Sunday. "It's complicated and 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
White, in his second year as league president, met last week with West and 
Phillips. Afterward, West and White gave contradicting accounts of what was 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on an Aug. 22 incident in which West ejected Phillie 
outfielder Von Hayes for criticizing another umpire during a game against the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies also claimed that West has been too rough with players. During a 
bench-clearing brawl against the Mets in New York, West threw Phillie pitcher 
Dennis Cook to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
West said White told him he handled the Hayes situation correctly. 
</P>
<P>
After learning about West's comments, White disputed them.

WEST HALTS FIGHT BEFORE IT STARTS

Umpire Joe West figured the best way not to be part of a fight was to stop one 
from breaking out. 
</P>
<P>
West, ordered by National League president Bill White not to get involved in 
any fights, halted Eric Davis from getting at Greg Maddux, after the Chicago 
pitcher had plunked the Cincinnati outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Maddux hit Davis with a fastball that appeared to get 
away from the right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I wasn't throwing at him," Maddux said. "I always try to work him with 
fastballs inside. That was an inside fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Davis took a couple of steps toward the mound before his path was blocked by 
catcher Joe Girardi and West. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cincinnati starter Jose Rijo threw a pitch which Maddux had to duck 
under to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not supposed to comment on this at all," West said. "But major league 
baseball has told (umpires) not to stop (players) from fighting. That comes 
from Richie Phillips (head of the umpires union). We're supposed to just let 
them fight. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to see a fight any more than anyone else. It was just 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
West escorted Davis to halfway to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux was fined $200 and West issued a warning to both dugouts.

THOSE ARE THE BREAKS, FOR BETTER OR WORSE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEDULES: ALL TEAMS WILL HAVE A WEEK OFF, BUT EXACTLY WHEN DURING THE SEASON 
THE VACATION TAKES PLACE COULD BE A FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taking a cue from the NBA and major league baseball, which seem to play 
year-round, the NFL has extended its schedule this season. Instead of playing 
16 games in 16 weeks, NFL teams will play 16 games in 17 weeks in 1990 and '91, 
and 16 games in 18 weeks in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule will supply TV with one extra weekend of games this year and 
next, and two extra weekends the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has also increased the number of playoff teams, adding one wild-card 
team per conference. Where there were two wild-card teams from each conference 
before, there are now three. 
</P>
<P>
On the first weekend of playoffs, two games will be played on Saturday, both 
televised by ABC, and two more will be played on Sunday, with NBC and CBS each 
televising one. 
</P>
<P>
Four division champions -- two from each conference -- with the best records 
will draw first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
The division champion with the third-best record will play host to the 
wild-card team with the third-best record, and the wild-card team with the best 
record will play host to the wild-card team with the second-best record. 
</P>
<P>
The first-round winners will then play the two division champions with the best 
and second-best records, the one with the best record meeting the surviving 
wild-card team with the poorer record. 
</P>
<P>
Because the NFL has more games to televise, the league received a better TV 
deal. The NFL's new four-year package is worth $3.637 billion; each team will 
receive $32.8 million annually, which is almost double the $17 million the 
teams received from the old three-year TV contract. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches and players like the new schedule because of the off-weeks. Each 
team will have one week off in 1990 and '91, and two weeks off in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new schedule will eliminate one of the two weeks between the 
conference championship games and the Super Bowl, although the NFL plans to 
reinstate the two-week Super Bowl buildup for the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the NFL extend its schedule? 
</P>
<P>
"The league has had a concern for some time that other sports were constantly 
expanding their schedule and that the NFL had the shortest regular-season 
schedule of all professional sports and had not made any change in well over a 
decade," Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to expand our share of the sports calendar as most other sports have 
done before us. 
</P>
<P>
"So, in looking at our schedule, we decided that we could have more flexibility 
in scheduling our games and we could pick up an extra week of television for 
our games. And we could provide a bye week for the teams, which most clubs feel 
will be useful in terms of healing for injuries and getting ready for the 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL will rotate off-weeks by conference. 
</P>
<P>
Four NFC West teams, including the Rams, will have an off-week during the 
fourth week of the season, with four NFC East teams getting one the next week. 
Four AFC East teams will be off the sixth week, and four NFC Central teams will 
be off the seventh week. 
</P>
<P>
Four AFC West teams, including the Raiders, will be off the eighth week, and 
four AFC Central teams will get be off the 10th week. 
</P>
<P>
The four teams that finished in fifth place last season will be off the 14th 
week. 
</P>
<P>
While most NFL owners accept the schedule format, the concept of teams being 
rewarded for finishing last, by getting an off-week late in the season, has 
come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept (the new schedule), as long as it's equal for everybody," Raider 
owner Al Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the idea of the fifth team in your division always getting an 
easier schedule, but that's the way it's set up." 
</P>
<P>
Not all coaches are in favor of the off-week format. Some have complained that 
the format benefits teams that have an off-week in the middle of the season. 
They say a break early in the season -- after only three games -- does more to 
disrupt rhythm than provide a needed rest. But it may be helpful for a team 
such as the Rams that has so many out with injury.

GREENE WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR RAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just as soon as Jerry Gray and Larry Kelm blew out their knees Saturday night, 
Kevin Greene knew he had the Rams right where he wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
If the 16 1/2 sacks Greene accumulated in 1989 weren't enough to convince the 
Rams to sign their first line of defense for 1990, Greene could now point to 
some numbers that might. 
</P>
<P>
1. Gray (torn knee ligament). 
</P>
<P>
2. Kelm (torn knee ligament). 
</P>
<P>
3. Jackie Slater (dislocated toe). 
</P>
<P>
4. Alfred Jackson (groin). 
</P>
<P>
5. Irv Pankey (back). 
</P>
<P>
6. Mel Owens (back). 
</P>
<P>
7. Cleveland Gary (back). 
</P>
<P>
8. Henry Ellard (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
9. Flipper Anderson (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
10. Aaron Cox (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
11. Fred Strickland (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
12. Darryl Henley (hip). 
</P>
<P>
13. Robert Cox (rib cartilage). 
</P>
<P>
14. Joe Milinichik (thumb). 
</P>
<P>
15. Doug Reed (holdout). 
</P>
<P>
16. Michael Stewart (holdout). 
</P>
<P>
17. Damone Johnson (holdout). 
</P>
<P>
18. Greene (holdout). 
</P>
<P>
Is 18 enough? One week shy of their regular-season opener in Green Bay and the 
Rams had nearly half their opening-day roster at bay or in sick bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams know Gray and Kelm and Jackson won't be back for at least four weeks. 
They know there's a chance Henley could miss the first half of the season. They 
know Slater won't be suiting up against the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing they can do about that. 
</P>
<P>
So, finally, they decided to check their able-but-unwilling list and do what 
they could, which was to do something that should have been done a month ago. 
They signed Greene to a three-year contract worth at least $800,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's holdout lasted 39 days and the entire exhibition season. In a few 
days, once the pads are in place and the body is slamming again, Greene will be 
focused on cracking heads and not the bitter contract negotiations that ruined 
his summer. 
</P>
<P>
But don't forget them. The next time you ask yourself why the Rams, with Jim 
Everett and John Robinson and all their other assorted assets, can't catch the 
49ers, you have your answer. The 49ers fly first class because they buy first 
class. They know you get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams know this, too, but hope their fans won't catch on -- which, judging 
from the record piles of season-ticket applications pouring into Anaheim 
Stadium, is a canny business philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Rams, by many counts, had the second-best team in the NFL. 
They also had one of the five lowest payrolls in the National Football League. 
Ram management not only basks in this contradiction but flaunts it as well, 
choosing one high-profile player as its annual poster boy and applying the 
clamps for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
Greene was merely this year's model. Before him, it was Greg Bell in 1989, Ron 
Brown in '88, LeRoy Irvin in '87, Ellard in '86, Eric Dickerson in '85. Pick a 
star, beat him up for a while. The younger Rams need an example. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene's case was as senseless as any. Here, at the outset of training camp 
anyway, was a team that held Robinson's best chance yet of reaching a Super 
Bowl. And here was Greene, the Rams' second most valuable player, the Jim 
Everett of the Ram defense, except that Greene doesn't have Everett's 
supporting cast. Last year, the Rams finished 21st in team defense with Greene. 
Without him, Everett might have to throw for 5,000 yards just to break even. 
</P>
<P>
Greene was asking for $1 million a year, hardly outrageous in these days of 
Keith McCants windfalls, especially when the Rams had Greene buried at $225,000 
in 1989. But John Shaw, the Rams' executive vice president, had to make a 
point, had to send a message. 
</P>
<P>
He did. Ram management, bottom line, doesn't give a flying wedge about winning. 
</P>
<P>
In Ram lexicon, Super Sunday is any home game that sells out. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it took a deluge of wounded knees, thighs and backs to force the 
Rams' hand. Right now, three offensive tackles are down. Three linebackers are 
down. An entire secondary had been wiped out until Stewart was signed Sunday. 
Disaster is too kind a description. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Rams face the daunting prospect of lining up against Sterling 
Sharpe and Co. with Latin Berry at one cornerback and Bobby Humphery at the 
other. Berry is a converted running back, a rookie out of the University of 
Oregon. Humphery is a converted wide receiver, having made the switch a few 
years ago with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, this week's best news is that the Packers haven't yet converted 
Don Majkowski from holdout to quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
So at least the Rams have that going for them, which is nice. They also have a 
kind September schedule -- the unarmed Packers, Tampa Bay, Philadelphia at 
home, a badly needed week off. 
</P>
<P>
And, they have Kevin Greene, back from sideline limbo and back into the line of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
It's a start.

FDR'S YACHT IS GETTING SHIPSHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: RESTORATION FUNDS ARE RUNNING SHORT, BUT THERE ARE EFFORTS TO MAKE THE 
POTOMAC PART OF A HISTORIC PARK IN OAKLAND. THE CITY HOPES THAT IT WILL LURE 
VISITORS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt plucked from obscurity a 165-foot 
Coast Guard cutter and ordered it refitted with a dining salon, staterooms and 
a hand-operated elevator to accommodate the wheelchair he used after being 
crippled by polio. 
</P>
<P>
For the next decade, until his death, the austere, gleaming-white yacht, 
rechristened the Potomac, served as a "floating White House," where Roosevelt 
entertained kings, queens and political leaders and spent countless weekends 
fishing from the teak-covered deck, a haven from the troubles of Depression and 
war. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the ship is in the final stages of a long, against-the-odds face 
lift at the Port of Oakland after years of bouncing from one owner to another, 
including Elvis Presley, before literally sinking into ignominy after being 
seized by U.S. Customs in a drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, an Oakland Democrat, will 
introduce a bill in Congress later this month to establish the USS Potomac 
National Historical Park. The Potomac itself would be a floating museum of the 
Roosevelt era, ferrying schoolchildren on San Francisco Bay and the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
The designation would make the restored ship and a planned visitor center 
eligible for an estimated $1 million in annual federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, the costly restoration effort, always a hand-to-mouth affair, is in 
some danger of running aground even as workers install the woodwork and light 
fixtures in the staterooms, salon and fantail. 
</P>
<P>
To date, at least $3.5 million raised from government and private sources has 
been spent to refurbish the ship, not counting thousands of dollars' worth of 
donated equipment and building materials. And the furnishings have yet to be 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost out of money," Dan Holdgate, project manager for the rebuilding, 
said on a recent tour of the ship. "The Potomac probably will be running by 
mid-September, but we might not have the money to buy life rafts and vests." 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts continue, and officials expect the restoration to be 
completed. But they note that a key to the ship's future will be qualifying for 
government funds. 
</P>
<P>
Given the vessel's tumultuous past, it comes as no surprise to many associated 
with the restoration that the Potomac still faces rough sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Originally called the Electra, the ship was built by the Manitowoc Ship 
Building Co. in Manitowoc, Wis., in 1934. Its first duty was to chase 
rumrunners, who were still around in the early days after Prohibition was 
repealed in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Roosevelt was using the yacht Sequoia, an ornate vessel not 
particularly to his liking. Aides feared that it would be difficult to evacuate 
the crippled leader should the wooden vessel catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt, an avid sailor and former assistant secretary of the Navy, picked 
the Electra for conversion into a presidential yacht at a cost of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, a hand-powered elevator was installed in the after stack 
to enable the President to ride to and from the boat deck. A large, 
leather-covered settee was built into the fantail; photographs of the time show 
Roosevelt, with his trademark cigarette holder, enjoying cocktails with guests 
there. Wicker chairs and tables and -- when Roosevelt's military advisers 
deemed necessary -- bulletproof glass completed the outdoor furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Below decks, stainless steel bathtubs were added in the President's and guest 
quarters. Leather furniture, wood paneling and brass fixtures were installed 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
In one interior room containing radio equipment, Roosevelt conducted at least 
one of his famous "Fireside Chats." 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a boat that could be used for a number of purposes, but when 
you used it for a yacht, you weren't ashamed of it," FDR's oldest son, James, 
recalled in an interview at his Corona del Mar home. Visitors, he said, often 
were astonished that the ship was quite plain. 
</P>
<P>
Log entries show that it was used for travels from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Key 
West. Roosevelt often used it for fishing jaunts on the Chesapeake Bay. In 
1939, England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mum) joined 
the President and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on a journey down the Potomac 
River to Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Potomac was part of a notable ruse in 1941. FDR left Maine aboard the yacht 
but secretly met a cruiser that carried him to a rendezvous with British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill off Newfoundland, where the two leaders signed the 
Atlantic Charter, creating the wartime alliance. Aboard the Potomac, crew 
members stood in for the President, fishing from the deck in boat cloak and 
snap-brim hat. The secret rendezvous went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, President Harry S. Truman replaced the Potomac with a larger 
vessel, the Williamsburg. The Potomac was mustered out of the Navy, 
decommissioned by the Coast Guard and sold to the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland sold the ship in 1960 to a company that used it to ferry passengers 
and freight between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the next few years, 
it changed hands many times. In 1964, Presley bought it for $55,000. He later 
donated it to Danny Thomas' pet project, St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., 
which planned to convert it to a restaurant to raise money. The cost proved too 
great, and St. Jude's auctioned it off. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a Southern California group pulled off the damaged teak upper deck and 
poured concrete, planning to turn the ship into a floating disco palace. That 
didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the vessel was looking shabby. An effort to convert it into a 
tourist attraction at San Pedro's Ports O' Call went nowhere. The ship was 
towed to Stockton and then to San Francisco's Pier 26. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, 1980, U.S. Customs seized the Potomac and a companion vessel, the 
Valkyure, which had 21 tons of marijuana on board. Although no drugs were found 
aboard the Potomac, it was a case of guilt by association. The yacht was 
apparently being used as a command post for drug smugglers purporting to be a 
charity for crippled children. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy towed the bedraggled vessel to the Treasure Island naval installation 
in San Francisco Bay. In 1981, the rusted hull was pierced by pilings, and the 
Potomac sank in 35 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy salvage crew spent 12 days lifting her from the muddy bottom of the bay. 
That April, the Port of Oakland, the sole bidder, bought the rusted, derelict 
heap for $15,000 at auction. It hauled it to dry-dock and provided $400,000 in 
seed money to help establish the Assn. for the Preservation of the Presidential 
Yacht Potomac, a mostly volunteer organization charged with overseeing the 
project. Congress authorized $2.5 million for restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
All seemed fine until workers struck the shipyard that won the contract. 
Eventually, workers at the Colberg yard in Stockton spent months welding on a 
new hull and replacing the pilot cabin. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration is now in the final stages back at the Oakland waterfront, 
workers hoping to have the vessel shipshape for a recommissioning. Historic 
photos are guiding them as they attempt to duplicate furniture and match the 
ship's appearance, inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to putting in 8 to 10 hours a day, project manager Holdgate spends 
an estimated 25 hours a week in his home garage finishing wood for cabinets and 
trim -- "to save money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the ship as a national landmark and park would be a boon for 
Oakland, which has struggled to make Jack London Waterfront a tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to have a land-based FDR interpretive center at an already 
completed Roosevelt Pier, built with a $446,000 grant from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Potomac also stands a good chance in October of being named a national 
historic landmark by the National Park System Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the only memorial (to FDR) on the West Coast and would be 
differentiated from the others on the East Coast, which are immovable," said 
James Roosevelt, 82, a close adviser to his father who often sailed aboard the 
Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Delgado, chief maritime historian for the National Park Service in 
Washington and head of the National Maritime Initiative, a program supporting 
preservation of historic vessels, hailed the effort. Aboard the Potomac, he 
said, "there very much is a sense of FDR."

HARD TIMES HAVE ROCK PROMOTERS SINGING THE BLUES 
</P>

After selling out arenas in more than two dozen cities earlier this year, the 
New Kids on the Block pop group was so confident their box office would 
continue to boom that they scheduled two concerts this month at 50,000-seat 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But after a four-month marketing effort that included promotional tie-ins with 
McDonald's restaurants and local radio stations, promoter MCA Concerts canceled 
the second show for the group, which is one of the hottest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Bension, president of MCA Concerts, a subsidiary of the entertainment 
conglomerate MCA Inc., said New Kids didn't want to do an extra show. Yet with 
only days to go before the Sept. 14 event, MCA was still advertising tickets 
for the single show. 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll promoters are facing turbulent times as they get squeezed by 
higher costs, a dearth of music superstars with staying power and a fickle 
generation of teen-agers who -- in the 1990s -- have video games, MTV and other 
post-Woodstock diversions to compete with live concerts. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, nearly half a dozen California promoters have gone out of 
business, including Pacific Concerts, which folded three years after being 
established in 1986, said Jacobs Moss, general manager of Avalon Productions, 
Southern California's largest independent concert promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Those still in business are having a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
Slow ticket sales recently prompted Bill Graham, perhaps the nation's 
best-known concert promoter, to move a show featuring the Ramones, Debbie Harry 
and two other groups from the 15,000-seat Arco Arena in Sacramento to the 
2,250-seat Warfield Theater in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A Labor Day weekend concert that was to feature 50 acts -- including Tanya 
Tucker and Tony! Toni! Tone! -- in San Bernardino had sold just 20,000 of 
90,000 tickets a day before the show, promoter Michael Scafuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ticket prices in the past 18 months -- paced by the Rolling Stones' 
then-record $30 tickets in 1989 -- have jumped 20% to an average of more than 
$20 as promoters have scrambled to cover higher costs of talent, insurance and 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of going to shows has gotten so high, people can't afford to go to 
concerts every month," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert promotion 
trade magazine Pollstar. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the concert industry in the long run," added Peter 
Patton, assistant manager of the Richfield (Ohio) Coliseum. "I don't know if 
we'll ever get back to the days of having the number of concerts we used to. We 
are experiencing worse business in terms of ticket sales," he said, citing a 
recent Linda Ronstadt concert. 
</P>
<P>
Long considered a glamorous enterprise, albeit one in which reliable financial 
figures are hard to come by, concert promotion today is undergoing dramatic 
change as promoters and musical groups pay more attention to the bottom line to 
reduce the financial risk in a business that's long been known for its cyclical 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pollstar estimates that the top 100 moneymaking concerts generated 
$110 million in ticket sales in the first six months of this year, compared to 
$64 million in the first half of 1989, the midyear tally was boosted by a 
larger-than-normal number of tours from superstars who rarely go on the road, 
such as Paul McCartney, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Moneymaking concert tours 
have fallen off sharply this summer, and most experts say they expect fewer 
successful concerts the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the business has been in a trend toward fewer concerts across the 
country," said MCA's Bension. "I think the MTV argument is a valid one. Bands 
get TV exposure, and they burn out more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Already, touring has fallen off in secondary markets such as Richmond, Va., 
said Peter Luukko, a regional vice president for Spectacor Management Group, 
which operates 22 arenas around the country. Although major markets such as Los 
Angeles and New York still attract brisk business, promoters say they're 
meeting resistance to high ticket prices, and they're becoming reluctant to 
promote acts that aren't superstars. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, promoters lavished time and money developing bands, starting 
them out in small clubs and moving them up. By doing so, bands developed a 
loyal following and were considered a long-term investment. Money flowed so 
freely that few promoters balked at artists' demands for expensive 
accommodations or paying expenses for "groupies" and other concert hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
But today, promoters and facility operators are streamlining their business to 
cut out middlemen, protect their margins and control more links in the concert 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
"The groupies have been replaced by MBAs," said Moss of Avalon. "The amounts of 
money that are on the line today demand that everybody be more businesslike and 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor's Luukko said settlement of the $9.3 million in ticket receipts from 
last year's Rolling Stones concert at the Los Angeles Coliseum took just 20 
minutes with the aid of the band accountant's portable computer. Years ago, 
Luukko said, he often stayed up until 3 a.m. haggling over ticket receipts with 
band financial personnel who were often intoxicated or inept. 
</P>
<P>
Concert promotion began changing about a decade ago, when the advent of cable 
television's 24-hour rock music channel, MTV, enabled musicians to become stars 
without having to go on lengthy tours to meet fans face-to-face, according to 
promoter Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the new video competition, promoters and facilities operators fought 
back, trying to make concerts more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
They rushed to build open-air amphitheaters, which were not only cheaper to 
construct than enclosed arenas but offered concert-goers outdoor ambience with 
their music. And promoters made it easier to buy tickets by using agents, such 
as Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster, that market tickets nationwide with 
computers and an army of telephone sales people. 
</P>
<P>
Artists changed too. 
</P>
<P>
To compete with TV, they added special effects to increase the visual spectacle 
at live concerts. Lasers, smoke bombs and other gimmicks are now commonplace at 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
But while promoters and artists worked on making concert-going easier and more 
entertaining, they were getting squeezed by rising costs, particularly for 
insurance, talent fees and facility rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, for example, liability insurance for concerts has more than 
tripled, according to Alicefay Prine, vice president of Marsh &amp; McLennan 
Worldwide, a New York-based business insurance broker. Insurers now charge 
between 15 cents and 30 cents a person for $1 million of liability coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, artists who once got a flat payment from promoters now often receive 
a guaranteed fee, a percentage of ticket sales and income from merchandising 
deals, said Richard Walters, a vice president at Famous Artists Agency, which 
represents over 150 artists, including New Kids on the Block. 
</P>
<P>
Talent fees are negotiable and can vary dramatically according to artist, venue 
and even time of year. But artists who got $25,000 to $50,000 a decade ago to 
perform can now make 10 times that, promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a major artist now gets 50% to 70% of gross ticket receipts, experts 
say. Of that percentage, the artist's agent and manager get 25%. The remaining 
30% to 50% of receipts go to the promoter, who must pay insurance fees, 
facility rental, security and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those rough figures, the Rolling Stones and their managers may have 
received as much as $60 million from the estimated $98 million in ticket sales 
generated in their 33-city concert tour last year. Neither representatives of 
the group, which was without an agent at the time, nor promoter BCL 
Entertainment of Toronto could be reached to comment on Pollstar's financial 
estimates of the tour, which don't include income from merchandising deals. 
</P>
<P>
The national promotion deal that BCL brokered with the Stones, and the huge 
sums of money they paid for the group, are troubling signs of how the concert 
business may be changing, some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are spending X millions of dollars for the Rolling Stones, what's 
going to happen with the other (less well-known) artists?" Bension asked 
rhetorically. "This type of operation is not going to buy the Tracy Chapmans of 
the world. But (such artists) need exposure too." 
</P>
<P>
With promoters such as BCL offering huge sums of money to major acts for a 
national tour, less well-financed local promoters are being squeezed out. 
</P>
<P>
They are being replaced by big outfits such as MCA Concerts, Bill Graham 
Presents and Ft. Lauderdale-based Cellar Door Co., as well as arena operators 
such as Ogden Allied Facility Services that are developing their own staffs to 
book and promote talent. 
</P>
<P>
These promoters have stayed afloat financially by cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
MCA, Graham, Avalon and many other major promoters, for instance, have been 
buying more of the amphitheaters where they stage concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, said Bension of MCA Concerts, a promoter who owns his own 
facility could lose money on the concert but make a profit overall when arena 
rental, merchandising, parking and other fees are figured in. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with costs continuing to rise, such vertical integration may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's margins are getting squeezed today," Spectacor's Luukko said. 
"Promoters are paying more for talent; buildings are getting more favorable 
rental deals; tickets cost a lot more. About the only person coming out ahead 
is the act. . . . Maybe I should go on stage."

GAS PRICE HIKES LESS PAINFUL TO EUROPE'S DRIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THEY ALREADY PAY MUCH MORE PER GALLON THAN AMERICANS DO. THUS, 
INCREASES AREN'T AS LARGE -- IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE -- AS U.S. INCREASES.

<P>
American motorists, fuming over high gasoline prices, can take some comfort 
from not living in Italy or Sweden or France. 
</P>
<P>
European gasoline prices, which were already over $3 a gallon in many countries 
due to high government taxes, have skyrocketed in the wake of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait to as high as $4.92 a gallon in Italy, $4.85 in Sweden and 
$4.37 in France. 
</P>
<P>
To put that into perspective, a 15-gallon fill-up in Rome could cost as much as 
$74. 
</P>
<P>
But Europeans, who use less gasoline than car-crazy Americans, probably won't 
suffer as much as their stateside brethren, analysts said Friday. They're used 
to conserving, and their cars on average get vastly better mileage. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the European price increases reflect the weakening dollar, which has 
fallen dramatically against most European currencies in the last week. Prices 
translated into dollars appear higher than they might have a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the price hikes also reflect very real increases in the price of crude oil 
in Europe, most of which have been passed directly to consumers. Since the 
Iraqi invasion, crude oil prices have risen from less than $18 a barrel in July 
to as high as $32 before falling back to around $26 or $27. 
</P>
<P>
Europe is heavily dependent on imported oil and refined products, mainly from 
the Middle East. A big source of European gasoline was Kuwait before the 
invasion shut down Kuwaiti refineries. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of European gasoline prices on Aug. 25 by the Associated Press showed 
that Italy and Sweden had the highest prices, followed by Denmark ($4.46 a 
gallon), France ($4.37) and the Netherlands ($4.21). The lowest were in England 
($3.56), Greece ($3.23), Spain ($3.14) and West Germany ($3.05). 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was no accident that Italy, with strict price controls that 
prohibit price declines, had the highest prices, while West Germany, a major 
auto maker with no price controls, had the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. Energy Department released a comparison of selected 
international price increases, excluding taxes and duties, between July 30 and 
last Monday. The biggest was 42 cents a gallon in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Italy had the smallest increase at 21 cents a gallon. Other increases: 25 cents 
for Belgium, 26 cents for the United Kingdom, 34 cents for West Germany and 40 
cents in France. 
</P>
<P>
The French government has reportedly imposed price controls to stem increases 
since the Iraqi invasion. That has led to runaway demand -- and problems at gas 
stations. "Dealers have had to close down early, or are refusing to operate at 
all," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist with the Institute for 
International Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, prices were up only 6 cents a gallon. The Japanese government 
maintains strict controls on the pricing of gasoline, analysts pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, price hikes in the United States averaged about 16 cents a 
gallon, the Energy Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is a paradise for European motorists," said Daniel Yergin, president 
of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Massachusetts. "They regard our 
gasoline prices as virtually free." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stiff price hikes, European consumers are less likely to be as 
adversely affected as their American counterparts, analysts said. For one 
thing, because European gasoline prices were high to begin with, the percentage 
increase in prices is less than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Second, gasoline is almost a luxury item in Europe. And Europeans rely much 
less on gasoline than do Americans. In 1989, gasoline accounted for only 11% of 
the oil used in the Netherlands, 16% of the oil used in Belgium, 21% in France, 
27% in West Germany and 33% in the United Kingdom, according to the consulting 
firm Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, gasoline made up 43% of the total oil used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"To a European, raising the price of gasoline is more like raising the price of 
a movie theater ticket than raising the cost of transportation," said 
international oil analyst John E. Treat at Booz, Allen. "Cars for them are 
something that's nice to have but not necessary to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have traditionally been much higher in Europe than in the 
United States because European nations use heavy gas taxes as a main source of 
revenue. Moreover, regulatory policies in some countries virtually prevent 
price declines. 
</P>
<P>
Such policies have fostered strict conservation among Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, their autos get roughly twice the mileage of U.S. cars," said 
Scott T. Jones, president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, (because) gasoline prices have always been much higher than in the 
United States, people and families have adjusted to that. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, it's extremely unusual to see a three-vehicle family in Europe, 
where it's fairly common here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans have the benefit of well-developed public transit systems in cities 
and railways between them. Moreover, commerce depends more heavily on rail 
rather than trucks, as in this country. And, perhaps most basic, countries are 
smaller and therefore the average distance motorists travel is shorter in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the price hikes have spurred protests from regulators and consumers in 
Europe as they have here, though not as many. 
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom and West Germany are both reportedly investigating possible 
price gouging by oil companies, and Italy has been considering a freeze on 
prices of petroleum products. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Europeans are not likely to suffer from any shortages of fuel. On 
Friday, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said it foresaw no oil 
shortages developing in the next two months as a result of the worldwide 
embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil.

Federated to Negotiate Tax Claim: The Federated and Allied department store 
chains said they intend to negotiate more than $500 million in additional tax 
claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service. Parent company Federated Stores 
Inc. said the claims were based on an IRS audit for 1984 to 1988. The audit was 
part of Federated's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The claims involve 
issues that include the tax deductibility of merger and takeover expenses 
related to Campeau Corp.'s acquisitions of Federated Department Stores Inc. and 
Allied Stores Corp.

Chrysler Reinstates Merit Pay: The company said raises have been resumed after 
being frozen last October. 
</P>
<P>
About 27,000 salaried employees are eligible for the pay increases, based on 
performance evaluations. The program was suspended as part of a cost-cutting 
plan designed to trim $1.5 billion from the auto maker's $26-billion annual 
budget by year-end. The reinstatement didn't sit well with the United Auto 
Workers union. The Detroit News quoted an unidentified UAW official as saying: 
"Chrysler's crying they ain't got any money. Where's all that money coming 
from, for raises for their salaried people?"

Goodyear to Lay Off 800: Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. cited sluggishness in

The company said the layoffs were temporary, the duration depending on "the 
economy and market demand." The layoffs will occur over the next several weeks. 
Goodyear said 270 workers would be laid off in Union City, Tenn., and 530 
layoffs would occur in Valleyfield, Quebec. The layoffs will include both 
white- and blue-collar workers.

U.S. Group Makes Sole Bid for Israel Chemicals: Israel received only one bid 
for a controlling stake in Israel Chemicals Ltd., which is being sold under a 
privatization program, a Finance Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding consortium is composed of U.S.-based Israeli businessman Arye 
Genger, who owns a majority stake in Israel's Haifa Chemicals; Chicago's 
Pritzker family and Great Lakes Chemical Corp., an ICL competitor in bromine. 
Terms were not disclosed. The stake's value has been estimated at $350 million. 
ICL produces fertilizers, phosphates and bromine. It reported a net profit of 
$100.6 million in 1989 on sales of nearly $1.2 billion.

CRISIS IN THE GULF UNNERVES GLOBAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY 
</P>

Shipping industry stocks have tumbled on fears that the embargo on Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti oil will leave tankers idle as insurance companies impose war-zone 
premiums and sailors demand hazardous-duty pay. 
</P>
<P>
Stock market shipping indexes have slumped 25% worldwide since Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, said Lloyd's List International in London. 
</P>
<P>
It said Norwegian and U.S. shipping companies have been hit hardest. An Oslo 
business newspaper reported that some Norwegians' shipping fortunes were halved 
on paper within two weeks of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Loukas Hadjioannou, the Greek owner of the world's largest independent tanker 
fleet, said 30% of all tankers could be laid up by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing that this crisis has done is once again stress the volatility 
of the shipping market, how open it is to outside influences," said David 
Glass, editor of Naftiliaki, a shipping magazine in Piraeus, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
London experts said 60 ships, mostly tankers, were awaiting orders near the 
Persian Gulf late last month -- at considerable cost to owners. But they said 
there was some increase in chartering -- leasing of ships for specific voyages. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding a decline in tanker activity are increasing costs for shipping 
companies resulting from the dangers caused by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Crews want cash bonuses for sailing in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance costs have increased as much as tenfold, though more often by three 
times, for ships in high-risk Gulf areas, according to Norwegian reports. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Vidler of Lloyd's Insurance in London said war insurance rates for ships 
have been raised three times since Aug. 2. But the highest premiums are still 
just one-tenth of the 7.5% of a ship's value that some owners paid during the 
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety has pushed the paper value of Norwegian ships down by $1.3 billion, or 
19%, since Aug. 1, according to Oslo's stock exchange. "If this crisis goes on, 
we'll be in trouble," Glass said, "because the developed nations will enter a 
recession, and they will have a smaller demand for oil." 
</P>
<P>
He said ships that can carry either oil or dry cargo could enter the dry cargo 
market, causing problems in that segment. Also, expensive tankers ordered a few 
years ago are being delivered now and "those who ordered them are going to be 
in trouble," Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
Shippers expect some relief because other nations, including some OPEC members, 
are expected to replenish up to 90% of the 4 million barrels of Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti crude lost to the market. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some tankers have won contracts to sail farther for alternate oil cargoes 
because Turkey closed a pipeline from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertain oil supplies could increase demand for coal cargoes from suppliers 
such as the United States and Australia. And higher crude prices would 
stimulate offshore oil exploration.

MEDIA STOCKS MAY RECAPTURE THEIR STAR BILLING; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: NOW IGNORED BY WALL STREET, THE SECURITIES MAY BECOME HOT 
PROPERTIES AGAIN IF FEDERAL RULES ARE CHANGED TO ALLOW NETWORK-STUDIO MERGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Media stocks, not too long ago the darlings of Wall Street, are now being 
shunned with all the fervor with which they were once embraced. 
</P>
<P>
During the mid- to late 1980s, media stocks -- which include movie studios, 
broadcasting companies, cable operators and publishers -- were bid ever higher 
in the belief that their cash flows were stable and predictable and would 
continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
But all of that has changed. Recession-fearing investors, coupled with a 
seasonally weak third-quarter advertising market, have depressed media stocks 
below broader market indexes to make them what was once unthinkable: cheap. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones media group, an index of 17 stocks drawn from different media 
segments, has sunk about 18% so far in the third quarter, after recording a 
modest 4.4% gain in the second quarter. The Dow Jones industrial index is off 
9.2% after gaining 6.4% in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Even the media group's brightest stars are not shining like they used to. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., considered by many analysts to be the best-run 
broadcasting company in the country, closed Friday at $476, down 25% from its 
52-week high of $633. And Disney, which investors have considered the closest 
thing to nirvana on Wall Street, has seen its stock plunge 25% to close Friday 
at $102.375. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, media stocks are not immune from the broader market retrenchment 
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, although perhaps they should be: All three 
networks report sharp upticks in viewing levels since the crisis broke in early 
August, particularly for their morning and evening newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the factors depressing the media stocks, especially cable companies, is 
the high debt levels accumulated during several years of merger frenzy. 
Transaction fever helped bolster stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The buying and selling of TV stations and cable systems has been at a 
standstill all year because the market will no longer finance highly leveraged 
transactions. But some anticipated changes in government regulations could open 
the door for another round of mergers and buyouts in the media business. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes involve repeal or modification of the so-called financial 
interest and syndication rules. The rules, adopted by the Federal 
Communications Commission 20 years ago, in effect prohibit networks from owning 
studios, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
A repeal or change in the fin/syn rules could substantially alter the media 
landscape. By allowing network-studio combinations, some analysts are 
foreseeing a round of buyouts over the next couple of years similar to the 
merger activity created by the deregulation of broadcasting in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
A studio-network is an appealing idea to many investors because it unites TV 
program buyers and sellers, who are continuously beating up each other over 
spiraling costs. 
</P>
<P>
Network and studio executives agree that at least some kind of regulatory 
change is likely, although to what degree nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
Before deregulation of the broadcasting industry in the early 1980s, no one 
took seriously the possibility that a network would be sold. But within a 
two-year period, all three networks changed hands, beginning a painful process 
of down-sizing. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite scenarios include Capital Cities/ABC Inc. merging with Paramount 
Communications Inc., General Electric Co. buying MCA Inc. and Walt Disney Co. 
buying CBS Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate consequence of any of the above combinations would mean uniting 
Hollywood program factories with national distribution systems. That idea is 
extremely appealing to some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney is in the business of selling Disney from the cradle to the grave," 
notes Ray Katz, leisure and entertainment analyst at Shearson Lehman Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"A TV network is the most efficient marketing vehicle around -- it gives you 
access to every household in the country. When you think about a 
marketing-driven company like Disney owning a marketing vehicle like a network, 
you see why Disney would want to own a CBS and probably outbid Paramount if it 
ever came to that." 
</P>
<P>
But analysts, many who assume at least one network-studio merger is a given in 
the post-fin/syn world, caution that there are factors mitigating against them, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to think there are going to be logical combinations: Capital 
Cities/ABC and Paramount, MCA and GE or Disney-CBS, which all the rumor mills 
are talking about," states David Londoner, managing director of Wertheim 
Schroder in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to look beyond those obvious combinations to the financial 
effects. And some just don't hold up." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Londoner asks if it makes sense for Capital Cities/ABC, with a 
market capitalization of $8.5 billion, to buy Paramount and pay $6 billion for 
it ($50 per share). "How would you feel as a Cap Cities shareholder if you were 
either diluted by issuing new shares or leveraged by issuing new debt to go 
into a business as uncertain as the movie business?" 
</P>
<P>
Londoner and some other analysts feel that, despite all the trumpeted 
"synergies" and "economies" frequently cited in possible network-studio 
combinations, studios still remain largely movie companies, and the networks 
want no part of being in the highly cyclical and volatile movie business. 
</P>
<P>
 A more likely scenario, some feel, is that a network may acquire a leading 
program syndicator, such as Cap Cities buying King World Productions Inc., 
which distributes "Wheel of Fortune" and "The Opra Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>
King World sells its programs to many Cap Cities-owned television stations, and 
the company is considered well run -- a plus considering that Cap Cities likes 
its subsidiaries to operate independently. It would also thrust the network 
into a business that it presently is not in: the syndication of shows to local 
TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
"King World is theoretically the ideal candidate," says John Reidy, media 
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. "But there are not 
many good independent TV production companies left, which would be the most 
likely to get snapped up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEDIA MERGER BOOM, ROUND 2 
</P>
<P>
Repeal of the so-called financial interest and syndication rules could pave the 
way for another round of big mergers among media and entertainment companies.

Five years ago, then Mayor Don Roth was banished from the head table at an

TRUCK RAMS PARKED CARS, KILLING 2 MEN

Two Garden Grove men were killed Sunday morning on the Santa Ana Freeway when a 
suspected drunk driver rammed his pickup truck into them while they were parked 
on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Loc Tan Nguyen and Juan Johan Vo, both 26, were killed instantly when they were 
hit by Steven Robert Garcia, 30, of Los Angeles, California Highway Patrol Sgt. 
Dwight Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia received minor injuries in the 4:20 a.m. crash. Two passengers in 
Garcia's truck also were injured. Rita Lozano, 26, of Los Angeles and Jolene 
Zeazey, 28, of Pasadena were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for 
treatment of severe cuts on their faces and bodies. They were listed in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the accident, Nguyen had parked his car Honda Prelude behind Vo's 
car on the shoulder of the northbound freeway and had walked forward to talk to 
his friend, who had remained in his car, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
As the two men talked, Garcia's truck allegedly swerved across a lane and hit 
both cars, killing the men, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still trying to determine why Nguyen and Vo had parked their 
cars on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The two men may have been discussing directions, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and vehicular 
manslaughter. He was being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to state Department of Motor Vehicles records, Garcia has no driver's 
license. He has an expired 1989 California identification card. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the incident is still under investigation and that witnesses 
are being sought for questioning.

STREET SMART: BRIDGE AT FEATHERLY PARK IS FINALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: Why don't they open up the bridge over the Santa Ana River 
at Featherly Park? The bridge appears to be complete and is needed to permit 
some degree of safety to the bottlenecked portion of the Riverside Freeway in 
event of some emergency. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it's remaining closed because neighbors across the river are 
worried about traffic flowing from the freeway through their neighborhood. But 
traffic could also flow out of the neighborhood to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
If they're not going to use the bridge, why don't they tear it down? 
</P>
<P>
Charles Jameson 
</P>
<P>
Corona 
</P>
<P>
The new bridge, which helps connect Gypsum Canyon Road with La Palma Avenue in 
Yorba Linda on the north side of the river, opened about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
But your frustration over the delay is understandable. The bridge opening was 
put off several weeks because of electrical problems with a couple of signal 
lights on the road leading to the bridge from the freeway, according to Jerry 
Crabill, Yorba Linda's traffic engineer. Officials opted to keep the bridge 
closed "for safety reasons" due to the balky signals even though the structure 
was raring and ready to have car traffic roll across, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crabill said the main reason for the bridge was not to provide relief to the 
freeway, but rather to allow residents of a neighborhood to the north of the 
river another access point to reach the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Your point about the potential use of the bridge by commuters trying to skirt 
the freeway is well taken. It's possible that during a crowded morning commute, 
traffic headed westbound on the Riverside Freeway might opt to get off at 
Gypsum Canyon Road and head out to La Palma Avenue, which snakes west well into 
the heart of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
If such a scenario takes place, it could introduce a new element of traffic 
into an otherwise quiet neighborhood that was previously just a collection of 
cul-de-sacs cut off to such incursions. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I often wonder why the Department of Motor Vehicles doesn't allow all 
motorcycles to use the emergency lane (outside the yellow line on the left) for 
two-wheeled travel. 
</P>
<P>
It would go a long way toward eliminating the dangers and occasionally serious 
accidents that result when motorcyclists split lanes between slow-moving 
traffic. Use of this space would involve no additional expense to the state or 
the driving public and provide an instant solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The motoring public may not realize that riding a motorcycle is far easier when 
it is moving, even slowly. When you stop a motorcycle, it wants to tip over. It 
is far safer for everyone if the motorcycle rider is allowed to keep rolling. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if there is some motorcycle-riding legislator who would get us some 
new law to use the emergency lane in stalled or slow-moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Welch 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
Even if the entire California Legislature rode motorcycles, it's pretty 
unlikely they would pass a law granting motorcyclists permission to use the 
emergency lane. After all, there would be no surer way to anger all those 
car-driving constituents barred from using the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials routinely cite a number of reasons for prohibiting 
motorcycles and other vehicles from using the emergency lanes as an escape 
hatch during traffic jams. It presents a safety hazard, they say, because 
stalled cars are often parked in the emergency strip or Highway Patrol officers 
are pausing there to monitor traffic. In such circumstances, motorcyclists 
could create a safety problem as they swing from the emergency lane into the 
regular traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, however, that the use of the emergency lane during periods 
of peak congestion is not without precedent. Motorists for a time were allowed 
to use the emergency lane on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway out of downtown 
Los Angeles during the crowded afternoon commute. 
</P>
<P>
But that rule wasn't discriminatory: It was applied to both cars and 
motorcycles. Moreover, the emergency lane in that section of freeway no longer 
exists. Recognizing the need to expand the freeway in the spot, state highway 
officials converted it into a regular traffic lane.

GWC OFFERS ARTS CLASSES TO FILL GAP AT HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As spending cuts in Sacramento have prompted local school districts to shrink 
or eliminate elective classes, many high schools have been left with the 
skeletal remains of once burgeoning arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
To help restore what has been lost from those programs -- and then some -- 
Golden West College this fall is offering an array of art, dance, music and 
theater classes for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The college's Academy of the Arts program, introduced in January as a joint 
endeavor with the Huntington Beach Union High School District, this semester is 
expanding to attract high school students from throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give those kids who are really interested in the arts opportunities 
that we can no longer give at the high school level," said Steve Schwartz, the 
high school district's fine arts coordinator who originated the program. 
Schwartz coordinates the Academy of the Arts along with John Wordes, Golden 
West's associate dean of business and arts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to program reductions, high school students interested in the arts 
have had limited opportunities to pursue them because the state's increasing 
requirements for math, English and other core academic subjects have squeezed 
out many elective openings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Students and program coordinators say the courses not only compensate for 
slashed school programs but offer high school students a chance to learn the 
arts in a more intimate and professional atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Last semester, 53 students attended three classes given through the Academy of 
the Arts program. The cost is $10 per class, and students receive college 
credit for courses taken, Wordes said. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the college is offering six classes, and Wordes said he expects 
between 85 and 100 students will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like this is offered in high school," said Penelope Pauley, who 
enrolled in the program's acting class last semester and performed in the 
summer musical "Grease." "There are too many (students) and not enough 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley said that, as a Marina High School senior last spring, she had been 
frustrated by the school's limited training and facilities. For example, there 
is only one theater among the district's six schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that there is not as much allocation of funds (for the arts) as 
there should be. . . . And it's not just theater. The band and choir suffer, 
too. We all lose out." JOHN PENNER

PRINCIPAL SEES BRIGHT FUTURE FOR LINCOLN JR. HIGH

<P>
As school was coming to a close last spring, the main issue facing the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District was the reopening of Lincoln Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
With overenrollment expected at all Corona del Mar elementary schools, and with 
vocal parental opposition to the establishment of a central middle school for 
fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders, the decision was made to reopen the Lincoln 
campus with separate facilities for primary-school students and for the 
middle-school grades. 
</P>
<P>
Since that decision, newly appointed principal Bruce Crockard has been touring 
the Lincoln campus with a growing enthusiasm. Crockard, opening long-locked 
doors and discovering musty rooms, is excited about what he called the 
educational possibilities of a school of this size. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be like Disneyland in here when the (students) come in," 
Crockard said during a recent tour. "It is so exciting to think what we're 
going to be able to do for these kids." 
</P>
<P>
The site will need about $5 million dollars worth of construction, initial 
maintenance work, furniture and supplies before the doors open to students in 
the fall of 1992. This fall, Crockard's biggest responsibilities will be 
working with the architect and looking for teachers and administrators to 
eventually staff the site. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful opportunity for providing things for upper elementary kids 
that normally are only found at the junior high school level," Crockard said, 
pointing out the existing science laboratories and huge media and library 
center. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 students from kindergarten to sixth grade will attend Lincoln, which 
once housed as many as 1,300 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
The school's available space will be used for activity rooms, math and language 
labs, and for long-term projects for primary or upper-level teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for a while, you could use the space for a math situation for, let's 
say, three weeks, and then if you want, create stores, so that students could 
use some real-life experience," Crockard said, leaning against the wall that 
will one day be part of the office. 
</P>
<P>
The primary grades will also have their own science laboratory, and all 
students will share an art room. LAURA MICHAELIS

LETTERS TO PARENTS SEEK DONATIONS FOR ACTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Back-to-school letters went out to some parents in the Irvine Unified School 
District recently that more closely resembled notices sent out by public 
television stations during a pledge drive. 
</P>
<P>
Because budget shortfalls have led to $10,000 cuts from the athletic programs 
at each of the district's three high schools, the letter asks parents to donate 
$50 for each after-school sport in which their children participate. 
</P>
<P>
"To maintain all the various extra-curricular sorts of things the school 
district provides, we're going to look to the community for contributions," 
Deputy Supt. Paul Reed said. "The brutal reality is, if we open the book and we 
don't have the money to run something, we won't run it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the state's allocation to education isn't keeping pace with rising costs, 
Reed said, the school district increasingly has been cutting back on 
non-mandated services, such as busing. This year, faced with up to a $5-million 
shortfall, the cuts will probably extend into areas where more of the students 
will begin to notice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 donation doubles the amount the school district previously requested 
from parents with children in after-school sports, band, cheerleading, theater 
and other activities. By law, the district cannot require a fee for 
after-school programs. But if the school district can't afford a program, 
officials will cancel it rather than divert money from educational programs for 
it, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Cost-cutting measures already have prompted the district to cancel Saturday 
junior-varsity football games this fall in order to save busing fees. The 
swimming pool at University High School will also be closed during the winter 
to save on heating and maintenance costs. TOM McQUEENEY

KIRK MCCASKILL NAMED ANGEL OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitcher Kirk McCaskill, who defeated Nolan Ryan and the Texas Rangers on 
Tuesday with a complete-game shutout, has been named Angel of the Week by The 
Times' Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old right-hander struck out four and allowed four hits in earning 
his 10th victory of the season. The shutout, his first since Aug. 20, 1989, 
lowered his earned-run average to 2.96, fifth-best in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
A check for $250 in McCaskill's name will be given to the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of Orange County.

TEN YEARS LATER, THE ANGER REMAINS; 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO: MEMBERS OF THE 1980 OLYMPIC TEAM STILL BELIEVE PRESIDENT CARTER'S 
DECISION TO BOYCOTT THE MOSCOW GAMES ROBBED THEM OF THEIR DREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1980, members of the U.S. Water Polo team were on their way to Hungary to 
play in the Tunsgrum Cup -- a prestigious tournament that was to serve as a 
pre-Olympic warm up -- when they heard that they really didn't have to bother. 
</P>
<P>
President Jimmy Carter, bolstered by Congress, had made up his mind. After 
weeks of posturing, Carter decided that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan made 
U.S. participation in the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow untenable. 
</P>
<P>
For members of that year's squad, and for the sport, the aftermath of the 
decision was as significant as Carter's move itself. That decision affected not 
only the 1980 team, but every U.S. national team fielded during the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 10 years later, the players and coaches can look at the decision with the 
benefit of hindsight. Still, the mere mention of Carter's action rekindles 
anger and frustration in team members. For them, the boycott always will signal 
a dream snatched away by politics and by uncontrollable events. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 Moscow Games would have been Terry Schroeder's first shot at the 
Olympics. When he talks about it, he puts his head down, folding his 6-foot-3 
frame onto his elbows and resting on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real empty feeling," said Schroeder, of Agoura Hills. "You were being 
used as a pawn for what seemed like really not a very good reason." 
</P>
<P>
* Rather than retire, Schroeder chose to return to the team. He graduated magna 
cum laude from Pepperdine in 1981. With the help of his wife, Lori, who took 
notes for him while he traveled and trained, Schroeder graduated from 
chiropractic school in 1986. He stayed on for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los 
Angeles and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
* Players like Joseph Vargas and John Siman say the boycott took away something 
from the members of the 1980 water polo team that can never be replaced. Vargas 
-- like half of the 1980 team -- opted to play in another Olympics. But by 
then, jobs, families and other influences became more pressing distractions 
than they were in 1980. That year, he said, the timing was right to win the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
* Others never had another chance. Eric Lindroth of Costa Mesa decided that 
he'd rather spend time with his family rather than spend 15 to 20 hours a week 
in the pool. He thinks about missing his moment at center stage each time 
Carter's name is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, soldiers on the Berlin Wall shot those who came too close. Inflation 
raced ahead. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan. And the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
after an intense lobbying effort, voted 1,604-797 with two absentions to 
boycott the games in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Walter Mondale, one of the chief lobbyists, called the vote, "a 
referendum on freedom." He added, "What is at stake is no less than the future 
security of the civilized world." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of other nations agreed with the U.S. stance, and countries with as 
little in common as Saudi Arabia and West Germany kept their teams at home. 
</P>
<P>
"You got the impression that the press would only print pro-Carter type of 
opinions," said Siman, a Cal State Fullerton graduate now living in Ventura. 
"Everything that you read in the paper was pro-boycott." 
</P>
<P>
Now, East and West Germany are poised to unify. The deficit is a monumental 
economic concern. The political twists of Afghanistan have returned to the 
obscurity of foreign affairs journals. And a Soviet leader has perhaps become 
more popular abroad than he is in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider how far things have come in the other direction as they have 
in the last few months, I don't think we accomplished anything with the 
boycott," former U.S. coach Monte Nitzkowski of Huntington Beach said. "It 
certainly didn't get the Russians out of Afghanistan." The Russians, in fact, 
left Afghanistan last year, largely because the war had become too costly 
politically and economically for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
While the boycott may have failed to alter international policy, for a decade 
its reach affected the national water polo team, which primarily fills the 
ranks with Californians. The team trains primarily in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. teams traditionally had been students or those a year or 
two out of college, although there sometimes were a few older players on the 
team. In 1980, after coming off a second-place finish in a premiere tournament 
the year before, the United States team was considered a top medal prospect. 
Nitzkowski believed the team had an excellent chance to win the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
But after the boycott many of the younger players decided to stay with the team 
and play in the 1984 Olympics instead of retiring to pursue other careers. At 
the '84 Games in Los Angeles, the U.S. tied Yugoslavia in the gold-medal game, 
but Yugoslavia was awarded the gold medal on goal differential. Many team 
members were so disappointed with the silver medal and chose to return again, 
this time to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. That year, they tied -- who 
else -- the Yugoslavs. But this time, because of a rule change, the gold medal 
could not be awarded on points. The U.S. then lost in overtime, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Because the team failed to win a gold medal in '84 and '88, the decision to 
boycott in 1980 was that much more painful. Siman, a member of the 1980 team 
who stayed on until 1984, said he was in better condition during the Los 
Angeles Games, but he played a better game overall in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"You're smarter as player, but you still have to go up and down the pool," he 
said. "It's a game of strength and a game of speed." 
</P>
<P>
While perhaps slower, the team of veterans did find itself smarter and more 
consistent against the normally dominant Eastern European teams. Schroeder 
thinks it's because they had played together for so long, making them more of a 
match for the older and more experienced Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge difference when you know other players' moves," he said. That 
familiarity helped the team win two medals in the 1980s. In 1976, the team 
didn't even qualify for the Montreal summer games. 
</P>
<P>
While they may have been winning in the pool, the team wasn't translating those 
victories into more training funds. After the boycott, Nitzkowski said 
donations for Olympic teams, particularly obscure programs like water polo, all 
but completely dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Hosting the 1981 FINA Cup, a prestigious international tournament held every 
two years, cost the program nearly all of its money. For the rest of that year, 
they were relegated to training individually and meeting at the airport before 
traveling to bigger tournaments, Nitzkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The national team never figured that all they had to do to raise money was say 
cheese. Just as Peter Ueberroth began turning around overall Olympic 
fund-raising efforts, the team took a group picture in swimsuits that sold at 
$5 each. At one point, sponsors had to set up an 800 number to take all the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
While the team may have been on better financial footing, the program left the 
players to fend for themselves. Except for a limited job placement program, 
there was no promise of any money in the future either. A true amateur sport, 
the only money that can be made in the game is abroad, and even then, there are 
no millionaires. For players like Drew McDonald of Orinda, who stayed on to 
play in 1984, part of the lure of the Olympics is simple recognition for all 
the training, the hours spent away from home and the hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"True amateur sports like water polo and crew, you compete for yourself," said 
McDonald, 34. "Walking into the Coliseum (for opening ceremonies in Los 
Angeles) was like walking into the sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
But the continued presence of the veterans made it difficult for the younger 
players to break in, and the coaches like Nitzkowski and Bill Barnett, the 
current U.S. coach and coach at Newport Harbor High School, tried to set up a 
strong "B" program for the future players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure to some extent it stifled the development of the younger players," 
Barnett said of the boycott. "But you still have to go with the talent." 
</P>
<P>
If the team's recent showing at the Goodwill Games in Seattle is an indication 
of their future, the pendulum has not yet fully returned. The team finished out 
of the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1980 Olympics seemed far away as Barnett surveyed practice earlier this 
summer at Newport Harbor High. The sun on that early Saturday morning glistened 
in the water, making it too blue to be real -- the sort of day you'd be off 
playing games with your chums even if you weren't training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, it seems as if the Olympics might again be dominated by the 
Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
"You're good at something -- I mean you're the best," Barnett said. "They want 
to show that."

SEA VIEW LEAGUE FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN IS FAVORED TO WIN TITLE, BUT ITS RIVALS ARE NO PUSHOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a matter of pride among Sea View League football coaches that their league 
is one of the most competitive around. So when the league's fourth-place team, 
Corona del Mar, won the Division VI championship last season, there were 
certainly some heads nodding knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that when we go into the playoffs people have to reckon with the Sea 
View League," said Saddleback Coach Jerry Witte. "Sunny Hills got all that 
recognition last year with the ratings, but then they went against Corona del 
Mar and Corona del Mar didn't have too much trouble with them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Sea Kings beat previously undefeated Sunny Hills, 27-0, in the 
semifinals and the next week defeated La Quinta, 21-10, to win their second 
consecutive Division VI championship. 
</P>
<P>
This was the same team that could win only two of its five Sea View League 
games and made the playoffs as a wild-card selection. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the fun and ferocity of the Sea View League, its coaches say. The 
old coach's saying, "On any given Friday night. . . " rings true and each team 
usually has a decent chance to win on a given evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like you're in the playoffs every week," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff 
Brinkley said, "because everyone realizes if you lose a game, you may be out of 
the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are lucky enough to be one of the teams to make the playoffs from our 
league you are in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Or in the words of University Coach Mark Cunningham: "If you can make it out of 
the Sea View League, you're licking your chops when it comes to the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The coaches have a point. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the last four years each of the Sea View League teams has qualified for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In three of the last five years, the team that won the divisional or 
conference championship was from the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During that time, teams from the league have won 63% of their playoff 
(24-14) games. 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for this success? The coaches, two of whom will be entering their 
17th seasons at their schools, cite themselves as one key to success. Most are 
experienced. Only Rick Gibson, coach of Woodbridge, which is returning to the 
league after a four-season absence, has less than four years of head coaching 
experience in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best coaches in the county are in this league, overall," Tustin 
Coach Marijon Ancich said. "Here, there are six guys whose lives revolve around 
the sport of football. That makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
In this atmosphere of competition and because of the potential for surprises, 
it's not always easy to determine which will be the teams that will make the 
playoffs from the Sea View League. But some good guesses can be made. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Tustin, which has its entire offensive backfield returning from 
the team that tied for second in the league last season, appears to be the team 
to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich, who is starting his fifth season at Tustin after 19 at St. Paul High in 
Santa Fe Springs, said the Tillers have six players with excellent speed, and 
they might be the fastest group of players at the school in 30 years. The 
Tillers, who already started their season by defeating Pac-5, 37-7, Friday in 
Honolulu, have an experienced quarterback -- Andy Borza -- and two proven 
running backs -- Visko Ancich, the coach's son, and Ron Goods. To that, add 
Shad Vickers, a transfer who gained 787 yards for Irvine High last season, and, 
in the minds of opposing coaches, the equation is a league championship for 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to find somebody to shoot arrows at and they picked us," Ancich 
said. "The word 'potential' is deceiving. It's good newspaper talk for the 
other teams to pin on bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some kids back that give us an opportunity to survive and win." 
</P>
<P>
And it's likely, Ancich's hyperbole aside, that Tustin isn't invincible. 
Although last season's undefeated Sea View League champion, Estancia, is now in 
the Pacific Coast League, a couple of the teams remaining could challenge the 
Tillers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of five all-division players, Corona del Mar still should be 
among the league leaders. Todd Kehrli, whose steady play as a sophomore was a 
big reason the Sea Kings won the championship, is a year older and stronger, 
and the defense is bound to be solid with eight returning defensive starters. 
Corona del Mar seems to get better as the season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the playoffs last year for the first time since 1983, Saddleback 
appears to have the talent to get back to the postseason. The Roadrunners, who 
won the Central Conference championship in 1985, have an experienced offensive 
line and a quick backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor, which tied Tustin for second in the league and advanced to the 
second round of the playoffs last season, returns only 14 lettermen and seven 
starters, the fewest in the league. But Newport Harbor has two players -- tight 
end George Greenwalt and kicker Josh Klein -- who were first-team all-division 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the last season Woodbridge played in the Sea View League, the Warriors 
finished third and lost in the first round of the playoffs, but the coaches are 
unsure what their return will bring. As a member of the Pacific Coast League, 
Woodbridge won the Desert-Mountain Conference championship in 1987 and was the 
runner-up to Trabuco Hills in the Division VIII championship game in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors had an off-year last season, finishing fourth in the Pacific Coast 
League. They would seem to be at a disadvantage this season because the 
competition in the Sea View League is better. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to put us dead last," said Gibson, Woodbridge coach. 
</P>
<P>
University, a school which has had only three winning football seasons since it 
opened in 1971, may be on the brink of another one. Defensive back Donnell 
Dowdy, an all-division selection as a sophomore, has gained about 15 pounds 
since last year and could possibly be the Trojans' quarterback this season. The 
Trojans will be a young team -- they might start eight juniors on offense -- 
but judging from their performances last year, they might surprise some teams. 
</P>
<P>
In University's final game of the season last year, Tustin needed the victory 
to go to the playoffs; University wanted to have its first and only league 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans came within three yards of their goal. But trailing, 14-10, in the 
final minutes, Jerry Apana was tackled at the three-yard line after he caught a 
short pass for a four-yard gain on fourth-and-goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they looked past us or not," University Coach Mark Cunningham 
said. "If they did, they made a mistake. I know our kids have never looked past 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>

LINDROTH AND FAMILY LAND ON FEET DESPITE BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest fallacies surrounding the 1980 Olympic boycott is that if 
affected only the athletes. At least that's what Debi Lindroth would tell you. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband, Eric, prepared for what would have been his final shot at 
making the U.S. Olympic water polo team, she worked full time for four years at 
a building company to help finance that training. In addition, she played 
hostess to dozens of team members at their Costa Mesa home when they flew to 
southern California to train every other weekend. The team members had 
nicknamed her "mom" because they often showed up hungry at her front door. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, she felt as much a part of the team as the players. When word of 
the boycott came, "my heart just sank," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a woman putting her husband through law school and saying 
OK, you can't take the bar," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the mention of Jimmy Carter's name means only one thing to her: a 
man who played the game of politics the same way a child would play kickball. 
"To me it was kind of like, 'You're not playing the way I like you to play, so 
I'm going to take my ball and go home,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Lindroth, 38, shares that anger. An Olympian in 1972, he was one of the 
youngest players on the squad and received little pool time during the bronze 
medal-winning U.S. performance. The team failed to qualify in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Olympic Games were to be his big chance. And the Carter 
administration's effort to assuage the pain -- a week of activities culminating 
with a medal presentation ceremony and a handshake from the President -- didn't 
change anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it all the time," he said. "I look at my honorary medal and 
think, 'That should be the real thing.' "

Instead of taking a spot on a platform, he went to the White House and shook 
Carter's hand, something many of the athletes chose not to do.

"I don't really think I said anything," he said. "I wasn't happy with what had 
happened, but I felt that I should go through and not be dishonorable as well."

Like his other teammates who were interviewed, Lindroth landed on his feet. 
Since water polo promised few financial rewards, most weren't counting on 
having public exposure of the Games secure their financial futures. 
</P>
<P>
He is now a general contractor in Costa Mesa. Married in 1976, the Lindroths 
have three children. But it's hard to ignore the possibility that if the team 
had gone to Moscow and medaled, Lindroth might have received credit for credit 
due. DANICA KIRKA

THE LOWDOWN ON 'CONTEMPORARY STYLE' VERSUS 'POINT OF VIEW'; 
</P>
<P>
A READER ASKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, AS SEEN BY A CRITIC. WELL, 
IN SO MANY WORDS, HERE'S THE BRUTAL TRUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jules Margolis, a professor of economics who retired a year ago "to realize an 
inchoate feeling that I wanted to sculpt," has written a long and articulate 
letter asking for more information about contemporary art. Hey, only too happy 
to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
"You wrote in your article of Aug. 13," the letter read, "that 'the type of 
contemporary art I review is work in a contemporary style, with a contemporary 
point of view.' There are three parts to that sentence, which I hope you can 
elaborate . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, what is "contemporary style" and what is a "contemporary point 
of view?" 
</P>
<P>
Uh-oh. Margolis' final exams at UC Irvine must have been the kind a student 
really had to sweat over. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said examples of his own work were included in a summer exhibit of 
work by students of painter Frank Dixon at the Art Store Gallery in Newport 
Beach. He said some of his "critical friends" seemed to be telling him that the 
work in the show "did not have a contemporary style." This puzzled him. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there are some curators, scholars, critics and artists who 
become so involved in one 'style' that they revere it to the exclusion of other 
styles," Margolis wrote. "I do not believe that there is a one-to-one mapping 
between current culture and a current art style. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless contemporary is a code word referring to a specific perspective, I do 
not understand how it is used. You reject as irrelevant the fact that the work 
may have a high sales potential. However, I am still enough of an economist to 
know that the market is the best indicator of demand and of responsiveness to 
the contemporary culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The painting that sells is in touch with 'current' tastes and preferences. 
Instead of relying on the people who think enough of the work to pay for it, 
you take the preferences of curators, art curators, historians and fellow 
critics to judge what is contemporary. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the short and brutal answer is: Yes, I'm using contemporary as a code 
word for a particular perspective, based on an understanding of the world as a 
cacophony of different beliefs and special interests, in which notions of 
"high" and "low" culture have become inextricably intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
Artists frequently can illuminate this highly relativistic world by linking 
heavyweight subjects to seemingly insignificant subjects or objects -- from 
such realms as advertising imagery, schlock art, educational manuals, verbal 
cliches or even waste materials -- in startling and unpredictable ways. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing isn't the specific "style" of a given work. What is 
important is the way in which the artist -- who is assumed to be highly aware 
of the history of styles in art -- shows us something previously unperceived or 
unarticulated about life. As part of its war against traditional dictates of 
art, this critical view frequently bypasses traditional notions of quality 
(such as, how finely crafted is this object?) in favor of the force and 
inimitability of the artist's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
This general perspective is shared in greater or lesser degree -- sometimes, 
with elaborate theoretical underpinnings -- by many visual arts writers for the 
major magazines. Other commentators -- including Hilton Kramer in the journal 
the New Criterion -- retain a conservative outlook that frowns upon what they 
see as a sorry slippage of quality in art today. 
</P>
<P>
Art today is a highly specialized field. There are different intellectual camps 
that support different approaches to art, just as there are Keynesians and 
monetarists in the field of economics, behaviorists and cognitive psychologists 
in psychology, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain: During the past century, critics, curators and 
historians have not been in accord with the taste of the general public on the 
value of contemporary art. Ever since the advent of Post-Impressionism, Cubism 
and the other late-19th and early 20th-Century "isms," notable styles in art 
have run counter to the tastes and interests of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
Three hundred years ago, a fresco in a cathedral could be both a recognized 
masterpiece and an image revered by the most unschooled worshiper. Today, both 
the styles and the themes of art frequently dismay and discombobulate "lay" 
viewers. That is one of the prices we pay for living in a society that is 
extremely pluralistic and intensely specialized. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense to talk about the validating power of the market when you're 
discussing, say, Hollywood movies. By its nature, the Hollywood movie is a 
business proposition, a costly vehicle made by a team of people to satisfy a 
mass audience. But a work of art is made by a single individual to satisfy him 
or herself. 
</P>
<P>
The history of art is to a large degree the history of style and taste. But 
when Margolis writes that "the painting that sells" is "in touch with current 
tastes," he misses the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The point is not just to reflect whatever people seem to be thinking or 
believing at the moment -- that's the job of magazine articles and TV specials. 
No, the job of the artist is to stay one jump ahead: To reconsider and 
rearrange aspects of contemporary life from different perspectives, to 
experiment with ideas and imagery with no immediate concern for how they might 
play to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Genuinely popular works of art today tend to reflect only a watered-down, 
no-sweat version of significant contemporary themes in art. It often takes a 
great leap of faith, wit and intuition to perceive just what an artist is 
saying, and most people simply don't have the time, inclination or knowledge to 
make that leap. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of work Margolis and his fellow students are doing in Dixon's class 
struck me as interchangeable with many exhibitions of beginning-level art. 
There is a lot of color, a lot of activity, a lot of "expressive" distortion 
going on here, but there are no discernible fresh ideas. Nothing seemed worth 
reviewing -- as opposed to giving a classroom-style critique -- because 
everybody was just jumping in and learning to do the dead man's float. 
</P>
<P>
The problem really wasn't the "style" of these works because they showed only 
the faintest awareness of style as an issue in itself. Contemporary painting of 
critical interest tends to indicate a skeptical awareness of the history of 
styles; routine work tends to cling unquestioningly to worn-out models from the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to another of Margolis' queries: "Should a critic try to avoid 
the temptation of creativity?" he asks, meaning the way I and my colleagues add 
our personal interpretation of a work of art as well as describing qualities 
that are more or less obvious to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Well, part of the process of looking at art is figuring out what it means -- 
what it means to you, that is. Some reviewers feel OK about talking to the 
artist about his or her work before writing the review. Others, myself 
included, prefer to keep our own counsel. Which is not to say that we don't 
occasionally do some homework to bone up on a particular movement or theory, or 
to find out more about an artist's earlier output. Of course, one thing we 
reviewers never want to do is to let the artist -- or another writer -- do our 
thinking for us. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what kind of research we may do, our real job is to interpret the 
art as we see it. It doesn't matter whether the artist thought about all those 
things when he or she made the piece. And it's OK if other reviewers and 
viewers disagree. The point of reviewing isn't to lay down the law but to begin 
a dialogue with readers and viewers: "I think this, for these reasons -- what 
do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what you might think, a critic's ideal readers are not always full 
of praise and agreement. It's great to hear from people who are plainly 
intelligent, feisty and curious, and unwilling to take any guff. Hello out 
there -- are there more of you dying to give a reviewer a hard time?

GRAUMANS HIT HIGH NOTE WITH PARTY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Peggy Parker Grauman brings all the professionalism of a paid worker to the job 
of volunteer chairwoman of the Music Center Opera gala heralding the fall 
social season Sept. 4. She also brings as co-chair her husband, Walter Grauman, 
the well-known director of many "Murder, She Wrote" episodes starring Angela 
Lansbury. The party follows the premiere of director Gotz Friedrich's 
production of Beethoven's "Fidelio." 
</P>
<P>
Together, they're putting the finishing touches on the benefit, meshing 
creative ideas and promising a "very pretty party" with the assistance of 
volunteers Jennifer and Royce Diener. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't the first Music Center gala on which they've worked. Last year, Walter 
Grauman produced the Music Center "Spotlight Awards." Amid the arrangements for 
seating at the Spotlight benefit, the Graumans slipped over to City Hall to be 
married by U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. after a courtship of 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
They are not newcomers to Los Angeles opera. Peggy was a member of Los Angeles 
Opera Associates, the group that tried in the 1960s to establish a resident 
opera company for the city. She and Walter attend not only the Music Center's 
annual fall opera opening, but the openings of each opera in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Grauman has devoted herself to opera benefits for five years. Even so, 
she admits opera isn't her first love at the Music Center. "I adore the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic," she says, adding that she's a pianist, taking two 
lessons each week and practicing an hour each day. When she moved to Los 
Angeles in 1957, she became one of the first docents for the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. Now she's on the Music Center Founders and Blue Ribbon boards. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy goes about volunteering in a professional way, the same way she runs the 
Grauman home in Los Angeles -- with two maids and a secretary to keep their 
eclectic collections (teddy ears, dollhouses, miniatures, Napoleonic 
memorabilia, museum opening posters, stamps, Fleur Cowles porcelain flowers and 
books signed by authors) dust free. Now that she and Walter are married (it's a 
third marriage for each and they have five children between them), they are 
expanding their collections: They've added toy cars and trains. To house it 
all, they've purchased a hilltop house and will spend 15 months adding a second 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Grauman's idea of a perfect day is to go to a miniatures show and top off 
the evening with a Rams game. They are avid fans. 
</P>
<P>
Says Walter: "When I met Peggy, I became aware of a whole new panorama of 
interests outside my job. You tend to work yourself into ever-decreasing 
concentric circles." 
</P>
<P>
"Walter definitely is not a long-suffering companion," says Peggy. 
</P>
<P>
He is a hero. After attending Wisconsin University, he graduated from the 
University of Arizona before enlisting in the Air Corps as a bomber pilot 
during World War II. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and eight other 
air medals for flying 56 combat missions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And, he's a star. His career was launched after the war when he worked for 
Universal in the publicity department and came up with an idea for a television 
show, "Lights, Camera, Action," which he sold to NBC. He's also directed such 
series as "The Untouchables," "The Fugitive," "Barnaby Jones" and "Naked City," 
plus more than 250 one-hour dramas and mini-series. He has five Emmy 
nominations.

REFUSING A HONDA MADE AUTO WORKER PAM RICHARDS A UNION HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a month since Pam Richards turned down a Japanese car on an Ohio 
lottery TV show because the car wasn't union-made, and still the adulation 
continues. Talk about twin peaks. She's not only the heroine of American 
organized labor, she's the darling of the American auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
She's been given two new cars and a third is on the way. She's done more than 
100 radio, television and newspaper interviews. Her phone answering machine and 
mailbox have been jammed with hundreds of chunks of poignancy. People send her 
union caps, lapel pins, pictures of their unionized factories, $5 bills with 
notes urging her to have lunch on their tab. All that's left is for Johnny 
Paycheck to write and record "Take This Car and Shove It." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a $13.86-an-hour Chrysler steering column assemblywoman from 
Risingsun, Ohio, a tiny working-class community 30 miles south of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made out like a bandit," Richards said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
All because on Aug. 3, when the master of ceremonies for "Cash Explosion Double 
Play" informed her that she'd landed on the "bonus square," entitling her to a 
$17,600 Honda Accord, Richards said: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want that Honda. I'm union." 
</P>
<P>
In the withering ranks of organized labor, so often on the defensive and so 
desperate for heroes, what Pam Richards did is being compared to Rosa Parks' 
refusal to take a back seat on a segregated bus or Ed Murrow's courage in 
standing up to Sen. Joe McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
She put herself on the line, her compatriots say admiringly. Symbolically, she 
stood up to the Japanese auto makers, who have eaten away at domestic car 
manufacturers' dominance and have kept prices low in part by fighting off 
unionization. The car Richards turned down was built at Honda's Marysville, 
Ohio, plant, where organizing drives by her union, the United Auto Workers, 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, the producers of the television show gave even greater voice to 
Richards' message. 
</P>
<P>
They censored it. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that they did not wish to offend Honda, the producers edited out her 
reason for declining the car. On the tape, aired the next night, Richards' 
mouth moved but there was no sound. Then the announcer informed the audience 
she would take a $1,000 cash prize instead. 
</P>
<P>
A Toledo newspaper broke the story two days later, and a few days after that, 
the whole world seemed to land at Richards' doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that it would last, you know, maybe a couple of days," she said. "It 
hasn't. It's been going like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Richards has become so celebrated that last week she effortlessly bridged the 
chasm between her union and the Big Three auto makers -- General Motors, Ford 
and Chrysler -- which are in the midst of tense negotiations on a new 
three-year contract covering 450,000 auto workers. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, less than three weeks before the current contract was due to 
expire, UAW leaders announced they were designating GM as their first target in 
contract negotiations. The UAW said it would demand unprecedented "job 
security" guarantees from GM, which has closed five plants in the last three 
years, laying off tens of thousands of workers. Industry analysts warned that 
GM, having lost much of its market share to the Japanese, was in no position to 
be generous. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, union leaders from Toledo brought Richards to Detroit, where 
presidents of scores of UAW locals were being briefed on negotiating strategy. 
The presidents gave her a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, she was taken to Chrysler headquarters in the Detroit suburb of 
Highland Park, where executives presented her with a new Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, this was becoming old hat. 
</P>
<P>
It all began the day after the lottery program aired throughout Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Richards went to work at Toledo Precision Machining, a Chrysler subsidiary, 
where she has worked for more than half of her 39 years. She was working a 
Sunday overtime shift. Everybody wanted to know why she'd been edited. When she 
told her co-workers, they were outraged. The workers told supervisors. The 
supervisors put congratulations on the factory marquee the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later in Washington, Tom Donahue, the AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer 
and one of the most fiery speech writers in the ranks of labor, read a 
newspaper article about Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, "this building just went ga-ga," said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty. 
The AFL-CIO, a federation of 90 unions with 14 million members, decided it 
would give Richards a car of her choice. Representatives called her. She didn't 
think they were serious. They called back. OK, she said, I'll take a red Dodge 
Dakota truck to replace the old truck her husband, a Chrysler supervisor, 
drives. Fine, they said, we'll fly you to Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
Before she could get there, a man called from Huntington, West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'Hi, don't hang up,' " Richards recalled, laughing. "He says, 'This 
isn't a prank. This is Frank Horney. Now, don't hang up.' I said, 'Surrrre.' He 
says he owns a Chrysler dealership and wants to give me an Acclaim to drive for 
a year. I told my husband. He said, 'Hang up.' But he kept calling back. 
Finally, he says, 'I've decided not to give you Acclaim.' I thought it was a 
joke. He says, 'I'm going to give you a Chrysler Imperial (a $28,000 car) for 
your loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
It was no joke. Frank Horney does exist. He flew Richards and a daughter to 
West Virginia. They stayed at the home of Horney's vice president and drove 
back to Ohio in the dusty-rose Imperial, stopping at pay phones along the way 
to check messages and call back the various radio stations begging for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they returned to Ohio, Richards flew to Washington to receive the 
Dodge Dakota -- technically, to pose with a model of a truck that is still on 
order. Richards held a press conference with AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland. 
She had so many TV interview requests that labor leaders asked her to stay a 
second day. She said she couldn't; she hadn't brought any clothes. The labor 
federation took her out to buy a dress stitched in a union shop. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't intend to insult Honda," she told one television interviewer. "I'm 
union. I buy what I build." 
</P>
<P>
Didn't she think her union was using her? one TV reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the union," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards is pure rank-and-file. She's never been an officer of her UAW local. 
She's known her husband, Mike Richards, from childhood, but they went on to 
marry other people. Both subsequently had two children, both got divorced and 
six years ago they got married to each other. 
</P>
<P>
She has a good-natured appreciation of her sudden role. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad for it. I'm really proud of it. People need to know. I like to buy 
union, or buy American. This is how I feel about it. I feel that the union has 
given me a lot through the years. I was laid off five years, and my union got 
four years and some odd months of that credited to me for seniority. Without 
the union, I wouldn't have the wages I do, or the health benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Ask her about the nerves she has touched -- why the television producers felt 
compelled to bleep out her declaration of union solidarity, why her union 
brothers and sisters regard her with such admiration -- and she's pressed to 
put it into words. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep wondering about that," she said. "They (the producers) stepped on a lot 
of people's toes." 
</P>
<P>
The unspoken explanation is that Pam Richards fell into a clash of two 
cultures, the culture of unionism and the culture that regards unions as passe. 
Neither side talks much to each other anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion of Americans who are union members has shrunk so drastically -- 
now about 16% of the work force -- that the word union is often viewed with the 
disdain reserved for a cult. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans regard organized labor as a campaign of greed, an entrenched 
special interest trying to get more. Many union members, meanwhile, have come 
to view themselves as defenders of a diminishing breed, the 
non-college-educated American middle class, the people who have managed to work 
their way up to a $13.86-an-hour job with only a high school diploma. Japanese 
competition -- leaner, more efficient -- has encouraged American employers to 
hold hourly wages below the pace of inflation, to cut the size of their staffs 
and contract work to cheaper non-union or part-time workers. Unions, their 
power eroding, have been so busy backpedaling that the notion of fighting these 
trends has almost been lost. 
</P>
<P>
Into this breach walked Richards. 
</P>
<P>
"She stole our hearts," said Lloyd Mahaffey, assistant director of a UAW 
regional office in northwest Ohio, who jokes that he wants to become Richards' 
agent. "What she did had so much impact because it came from an ordinary union 
member, not a labor leader. The feeling has been that somebody had to speak 
up." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Richards was a guest in Chicago's Labor Day parade. Today, she'll be 
the toast of Toledo's parade. When the phone rings, she and her husband joke 
that it's Johnny Carson. She has yet to go back to work. She's been on unpaid 
leave since the uproar began. The day she held a press conference in Washington 
with AFL-CIO president Kirkland, somebody asked her just when she planned on 
getting back to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, a smooth, avuncular man whose polish defies the public stereotype of 
a labor leader, leaned forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Her job will be there for her," he said.

In the spring of 1945, Arthur Rudolph had the Right Stuff. 
</P>

One of Nazi Germany's foremost rocket scientists, Rudolph was boosted out of 
the rubble of the Third Reich by an American government eager to add to the 
arsenal of democracy, and to keep the likes of Rudolph away from the Soviets. 
The U.S. Army brought him to America, cleared him for secret research and 
development work on the Pershing missile, and later, after the establishment of 
NASA, moved him to the space program. 
</P>
<P>
At NASA, Rudolph more than proved himself to his new patrons. When Neil 
Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr. landed on the moon in 1969, their ascent through 
space was powered by a rocket that Rudolph had built, the Saturn V. Three 
American Presidents shook Rudolph's hand over the course of his career. The 
Army and NASA each gave him their highest civilian awards. And in Huntsville, 
Ala., which is to rocketry what Detroit is to the auto industry, Rudolph 
retired a respected, pillar-of-the community type. 
</P>
<P>
So when does the Right Stuff become the Wrong Stuff? When it's preceded by the 
Reich Stuff, in the eyes of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a special Nazi-hunting unit of Justice, the Office of Special 
Investigations, caught up with Arthur Rudolph in San Jose, where he had moved 
with his wife, Martha. The OSI men interviewed Rudolph, then told him they had 
evidence linking him with thousands of deaths in wartime Germany. 
</P>
<P>
No, Rudolph hadn't tortured prisoners or conducted gruesome experiments on 
defenseless human beings, the OSI men said, but he had overseen the production 
line at a Wehrmacht rocket factory that relied on concentration-camp inmates 
for labor. Thousands of workers had died of hunger and exhaustion there. The 
OSI men said it was naive to think that Rudolph hadn't known about the deaths, 
or been unable to do something to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, fearing a war-crimes trial and the resulting dislocations for his 
family, renounced his U.S. citizenship and returned to Germany in 1984. He 
agreed never to return to America; the Justice Department in turn promised not 
to prosecute him or cancel his government pension. The Arthur Rudolph case, it 
seemed, was closed. 
</P>
<P>
But once in Germany, Rudolph began to regret what he had done. Friends, 
colleagues, even a small number of former prison-camp inmates turned up, 
seemingly ready to testify to his innocence and good character. One Rudolph 
supporter found a former prisoner who stated that Rudolph had gone out of his 
way to get extra rations for the suffering assembly-line crews. It occurred to 
Rudolph that he had acted foolishly in engaging an immigration lawyer back in 
San Jose, and not hiring a good criminal defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Rudolph had converted a small bedroom in his Hamburg condominium 
to office space and was spending the days there, sifting through the record of 
the case against him and devising a strategy to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
In early July, Rudolph and his wife flew to Toronto, and here, in Canada, set 
in motion a re-examination of the OSI's 
</P>
<P>
case. Canada's immigration laws bar entry to anyone suspected of committing war 
crimes, and Canada, on a tip from Washington, stopped Rudolph when he arrived 
at the airport immigration counter. But that was to Rudolph's benefit, for 
Canadian law also calls for hearings on demand to anyone thus denied entry. 
Rudolph, his family and a circle of visiting well-wishers from Huntsville 
petitioned for one. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to take advantage of Canada's generous immigration laws to get 
him a cheap trial, without the consequences," says Sol Littman, director of the 
Canadian branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Littman notes that if Rudolph 
loses his Canadian case, he won't be any the worse for wear; he'll merely have 
to stay out of Canada. If, however, he persuades Canada to let him in, then he 
will have a "precedent" of sorts to cite south of the border -- where, 
meanwhile, Democratic Congressman James Traficant of Ohio has introduced a 
resolution to have the House judiciary committee take a second look at his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"They know Canada is very likely to say, 'Look, he's an old guy. He isn't 
likely to hurt anybody while he's here. . . . What the hell -- let him in,' " 
says Littman. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian hearings, with a single immigration adjudicator, are now in 
progress in a small, windowless room near the Toronto airport. The hearings 
have pitted Littman and like-minded people against those who fail to see the 
point in "hounding" a shrunken and enfeebled 83-year-old, 45 years after the 
crimes in question are said to have been committed and two decades after he 
proved himself an exemplary immigrant with the moon shot. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph's appearance on the witness stand emboldens this second group: His eyes 
appear to be failing as he peers through a magnifying glass at photocopied 
court documents, and when he pauses for a sip of water, his palsied hands shake 
the contents out of the glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, my health is holding up well," Rudolph said when asked how he was 
feeling during a recess, but his voice was faint and he asked twice to have the 
question repeated. A few days later, Rudolph told the Canadian government that 
he was feeling ill and flew back to Hamburg. Now the hearings on his fitness 
for entry are proceeding in his absence, with Rudolph's lawyer pleading his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than the issue of prosecuting frail and elderly naturalized citizens, 
however, the Rudolph case poses broad questions about American official 
behavior throughout the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
If Rudolph was unsavory enough to be deported in 1984, after all, then why was 
he let into the United States in the first place, four decades earlier? What 
did Washington know about Rudolph in the 1980s that it overlooked in the 1940s? 
If the Army knew Rudolph was a war criminal and embraced him anyway, where then 
would it have drawn the line in its rush to beat the Soviets in guided-missile 
weaponry? At what moral cost did America land a man on the moon? 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hunt, author of a forthcoming book on the U.S. Army's use of German 
weapons designers like Rudolph, thinks she has some answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideology ran everything in this country during the Cold War," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The way Rudolph tells it, he never set out to build weapons for the Nazis; he 
simply grew up fascinated with rockets and their potential for space travel, 
and the only way to get backing for rocket research in the 1930s was to win an 
armaments contract. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph started out at the northern German proving grounds of Peenemunde, home 
not only of the powerful V-2 rocket, with its 200-mile range, but also of the 
devastating German buzz bombs. He and his colleagues tested their first V-2 
rocket in 1942; the following year, Adolf Hitler watched a launching on film 
and is said to have whispered, "If we had had these rockets in 1939, we should 
never have had this war." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, the British learned what was going on at Peenemunde and knocked it out 
with bomber raids. Rudolph escaped injury, but, since he ran the production 
line, was ordered to move the V-2 works to the safety of an old gypsum mine 
under the mountains near Nordhausen, in central Germany. The new rocket 
assembly plant would be known as Mittelwerk. 
</P>
<P>
"He found there a Jules Verne nightmare," wrote a friend of Rudolph in a 
pseudonymous vanity-press biography. "Beneath the mountains, an underground 
labyrinth had been constructed like a ladder. There were two tunnels more than 
a mile long, running parallel 500 feet apart and connected by 47 cross tunnels. 
Several factories were to be set up here, and the V-2 line was to be one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
A concentration camp was built nearby, to house the slave laborers. Their 
working and living conditions were frightful: Even German munitions minister 
Albert Speer, in his autobiographical work, "Inside the Third Reich," called 
Mittelwerk "barbarous" and noted that its Nazi overseers had to be sent on 
forced vacations to "restore their nerves." 
</P>
<P>
The air was freezing and thick with dust. Rations were always short. Weakened 
prisoners collapsed and died at their picks and shovels; others were crushed by 
falling rocks in the tunnels. United Nations and U.S. Army records suggest that 
25,000 inmates perished at the underground factory and its affiliated 
concentration camp, known as Dora. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, in an extensive interview with his friend and biographer, says that he 
was horrified to discover upon arrival at Mittelwerk that he would be relying 
on forced labor from a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I had the overpowering, awful feeling that I was trapped in a cage like an 
animal,' " he is quoted as saying in the book, " 'and that I was caught in the 
claws of the SS system.' " 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from Rudolph's case file suggests, though, that Rudolph in fact had 
wanted to use forced labor. Canadian lawyers have introduced into evidence a 
memo Rudolph wrote in 1943, before moving into Mittelwerk's tunnels, which 
tells of an inspection visit to yet another German armaments factory, one that 
used concentration-camp inmates and got good results. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph details the four-tiered bunk beds, the triple barbed-wire 
entanglements, the watch towers and machine gun -- and then asks for a supply 
of inmates for his own operation. 
</P>
<P>
Innocent bystander or policy architect? Canada is expected to rule in a matter 
of weeks. Meanwhile, the OSI points out that Rudolph joined the Nazi Party in 
1931, two years before Hitler came to power, and thus can't credibly claim to 
have joined simply to go along with the crowd. Rudolph argues that he joined 
the party because he saw National Socialism as the only alternative to 
communism. The OSI record also shows that Rudolph belonged to the S.A., 
Hitler's hated "Brownshirts." 
</P>
<P>
None of these entries from Rudolph's resume were lost on the U.S. Army in 1945, 
when it liberated Dora and lassoed Rudolph and hundreds of other German weapons 
scientists. The Army had set up a scheme, Project Paperclip, for bringing the 
German rocketeers, aircraft designers, wind-tunnel experts and others to the 
United States and to clear them for immigration. It was a tricky project, since 
U.S. immigration laws of the day forbade entry to members of Fascist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Project Paperclip empowered the War Department to screen the scientists, then 
present their dossiers to the State Department for visa clearance. No scientist 
found to "have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal 
participant in its activities" was to be cleared, and the State Department, 
which considered Nazis a security risk, was adamant about enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the military was candid in its analyses of the Nazis. Of Rudolph, 
for instance, an investigator wrote, "100% NAZI, dangerous type, security 
threat . . . ! suggest internment." (Emphasis in the original.) 
</P>
<P>
But later, when the Army realized how serious the State Department was about 
barring really hard-core Nazis, attitudes changed. For a time, a battle of 
memos raged as the Pentagon tried to convince the State Department that the 
Nazi scientists would pose a far greater security threat if sent back to Europe 
than if let in. But in the end, says author Hunt, the Army simply doctored the 
dossiers. 
</P>
<P>
In Rudolph's, she discovered, the investigators now certified that "nothing in 
his records indicat(es) that he was a war criminal, an ardent Nazi, or 
otherwise objectionable." Rudolph became a U.S. citizen in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who first published her findings on Rudolph and other Wehrmacht 
scientists in "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists," and who won an 
Investigative Reporters and Editors award for her work, finds the Army's secret 
revisions of the Nazi scientists' dossiers troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"It raises a whole lot of disturbing issues, which are very relevant today," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
In the relatively well publicized Rudolph case, she says, she sees a parallel 
with the use of deeper covert operatives such as the ex-Nazi Klaus Barbie. And 
the cozying up to Nazis strikes her as a precursor to more recent Cold War 
alliances with assorted dictators and strong men, many of them glorified by 
Washington while they were useful, then discarded just like Rudolph was when 
their usefulness had passed: Ferdinand Marcos, once deemed a bulwark of 
democracy in the western Pacific but later toppled in shame; Manuel Noriega, 
once a CIA "asset" in Central America but now awaiting trial in Miami; even 
Saddam Hussein, an erstwhile American ally but now the "Butcher of Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
"A pattern has emerged," says Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the ideology (underlying) Project Paperclip was that the ends justify 
the means," she says. "The intelligence officers knew what was right for this 
country and they were going to use these people, and if that meant breaking the 
laws, so be it. The question is, 'How far are we willing to go?' "

<P>
Like many manufacturers nationwide, traditional labor-intensive manufacturers 
in Orange County are having a tougher time keeping costs down and competing 
with businesses outside the region, especially those in offshore countries. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, with weaker defense spending and a possible national 
recession, manufacturers will have to work harder than ever to keep jobs in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College economist James Doti expects the county to show a slight 
decline in manufacturing jobs in 1990 for the first time, though at least one 
other report is forecasting an increase. 
</P>
<P>
One Orange County manufacturer that seems to be prospering despite the tough 
going is Pacific Scientific Corp. in Newport Beach, an aerospace and industrial 
instruments maker that has recovered from heavy losses in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The company has succeeded by diversifying its product mix away from defense in 
the past five years, says Edgar S. Brower, chairman and chief executive of 
Pacific Scientific, a 30-year veteran in the manufacturing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Pacific Scientific as chief executive in 1985, he was corporate 
group vice president at Allied Signal Corp. and president of Allied Electronic 
Components Co., a $12-billion subsidiary. From 1972 to 1977, Brower was 
assistant postmaster general of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Harry R. Goff retired as chairman of the Newport Beach firm, and 
Brower assumed the additional title of chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 1,800 employees, reported second-quarter earnings of 
$1.8 million on sales of $46.9 million, recording its highest quarterly 
earnings in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The company's backlog of orders is about $100 million, and its dependence on 
defense-related products has declined from 30% in 1989 to 25% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times staff writer Dean Takahashi, Brower talked about how 
a small-to-medium-sized manufacturer can survive in today's economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you describe what Pacific Scientific does? 
</P>
<P>
A. Pacific Scientific is involved in two broad markets: aerospace and 
industrial. We're very diversified within those markets. We're just under $200 
million in sales and so could be considered a medium-sized company that is 
fairly typical of Orange County. We have one plant in Yorba Linda with 200 
employees, but most of our manufacturing is done in the Midwest, East Coast or 
offshore. Within this diversified framework, we make small-cost, proprietary 
products. About 25% of our aerospace work is military and the rest is 
commercial. In the military products, that same technology is usually used in 
industrial applications. We're very mindful of the world trend to less military 
spending, which isn't all that new. That trend was foreseeable even before the 
changes in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the products you make? 
</P>
<P>
A. We are a leading manufacturer of fire-suppression equipment, and we're 
developing fire-detection equipment. In Yorba Linda we make restraint systems, 
or seat belts, for pilots in both military and commercial airlines. We make 
high-speed power generators and power supplies for torpedoes, missiles and the 
internal workings of aircraft. We're one of the major suppliers of DC motors 
and controls, a fast-emerging market in the last 10 years. We're the major 
supplier and have a leadership position in making light switches that go on the 
top of street lights, and turn them on and off automatically in the morning and 
at night. We make energy-saving devices for utilities and instruments that 
indicate where there are faults in underground utility equipment. Historically, 
we were strong in the snubber business, or control and shock absorption in 
pipes in the nuclear energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the firm's history? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's a very old company founded in 1919 as a distribution company. It 
started out as a West Coast distributor of electronic widgets for the emerging 
airplane industry and made things like the magneto (the ignition generator) for 
the Spirit of St. Louis (the plane that Charles A. Lindbergh flew across the 
Atlantic in 1927). The company diversified in the 1940s and got into a whole 
range of businesses. In the 1970s, it got into the restraint business, or 
elaborate seat belts such as sophisticated systems for jet pilots. It sounds 
really mundane, but it is a very technical, precise business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When did the company take on its current character? 
</P>
<P>
A. In the late 1970s. At that time, the snubber business took the company from 
the $20-million range to the $80-million range. It was very profitable and it 
was strong with the creation of the nuclear energy industry throughout the 
United States. But it collapsed in the early 1980s and so did the profits. When 
I came to the company in mid-1985, it was suffering from that change of 
technology and collapse of its highest-volume product line. We made some 
acquisitions and changed our strategy to emphasize the industrial side instead 
of military. We've very healthy and immune as any company to the current 
economic trends. All of the things happening in the economy now are short-term 
things that were predictable in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think we're in a national recession? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think there's any doubt about it. We're seeing it in our markets 
that have capital goods involved, such as in selling motors to the automation 
industry. We're seeing a definite chilling in which customers are not canceling 
orders but are watching their inventory. Is it a deep recession? No. Are we in 
a slowdown? Yes. It started about the fourth quarter of last year. We're 
shielded somewhat in military aerospace, where we have a three-year backlog. 
Our commercial airline business is strong and isn't seeing a recession. Our 
utility business hasn't slackened yet. The only two businesses that are 
affected are our motors and controls business and the particle detection 
business, where we build contamination-detection equipment for manufacturing 
clean rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Whether you're shielded or not, you are probably making changes to adapt to 
the economic environment. 
</P>
<P>
A. We think we're leading Orange County companies in adapting. We really have 
to organize around what I call our value chain. How are you going to satisfy 
the customer? That is what you have to organize around. Any company that 
doesn't and is still divided into separate departments like engineering and 
research and development probably isn't going to be in business five years from 
now. We started a transition to focus around a satisfied customer five years 
ago. You have to give them a quality product when they want it. We adopted what 
are commonly called world-class manufacturing concepts, such as just-in-time 
manufacturing and rapid-cycle manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you explain those concepts? 
</P>
<P>
A. Just-in-time theory is aimed at satisfying the customer. To do that, you 
have to be very flexible in your delivery. You can't have a lot of inventory 
because the inventory requirements could change very quickly with a customer's 
changing needs. I order only the inventory I need for firm orders, and I can 
respond quickly. Instead of building big batches of orders, we now try to build 
one piece at a time as ordered. We arrange to make long-term commitments to our 
suppliers and let them know how we need to be flexible. If everybody in the 
chain adopts the concept, we can all respond very quickly to changing world 
markets. This is mainly credited to the Japanese, but we taught it to them and 
now it's coming back to us. Rapid cycle is the same thing. Instead of having a 
lead-time on products stretching out to six months, we should be able to build 
a product in two days. We focus on eliminating all time that isn't devoted to 
enhancing the product. When I came here, we were delivering motors and controls 
in 18 weeks. Now we have a standard lead-time of two weeks from scratch. To do 
this, you have to organize differently. Instead of having an engineering 
department, you have cells of people with representatives from each department, 
such as marketing and engineering, and they live for one particular customer or 
product. In some of our factories, we make a room for a customer and paint 
their logo in the area to let them know that it is dedicated to them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Orange County's manufacturing base seems to be shrinking, with some 
companies moving out of the county and some just shutting down. What is the 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's a trend all over the United States right now, with companies 
going out of business because they haven't made the changes that we just talked 
about. The one problem that Orange County has, if not Southern California, is 
that the cost of infrastructure is very high. It's very hard for direct-labor 
people to find satisfactory living conditions. Housing affordability is down so 
low that about 19% of the population can afford to buy a house. It's very hard 
to attract a direct-labor force with that kind of infrastructure cost. Those 
things have a way of balancing out when you talk about the worldwide 
competition. There will be fluctuations, and Southern California remains very 
entrepreneurial with strong start-up rates. Q. What about environmental 
restrictions imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think California leads the way in progressive changes in the world and 
there is a value to that. I hope environmentalists, in considering the 
worldwide competitive market, will show restraint in their timing. Their goals 
are very laudable, but we have to keep in mind that we have to compete with and 
evolve with the rest of the world. There will be some times when we will be out 
of sync, but it won't be that big a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think that the defense layoffs in Southern California could make a 
recession here worse than what might happen in the rest of the country? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think so because the defense industry is so diversified. California 
has a strong balance of industries, too. There are a lot of major corporations 
here and very few of them are totally military. Most of them are a combination 
of military and commercial aerospace, which is still strong. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much will the high-tech industries be able to absorb the defense 
layoffs? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know. You would have to look at start-up rates and employment rates. 
We have always had a lower unemployment rate than the rest of the country and a 
good entrepreneurial spirit. I see no trends to change that. We also have a 
very high-age profile because of the climate. As that group starts to retire at 
a faster rate, that will also put a great demand on new employment. I think 
also there's a real question about the area's regional product, when you have 
these defense layoffs, that they are really a small part of the total 
population of the state. When we read announcements that 17,000 people are 
going to be laid off at Douglas Aircraft Co., that sounds like big numbers. But 
it's a very small percent of the jobs in the state. Through our own fears and 
our media we tend to greatly exaggerate those events. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said Pacific Scientific is diversifying away from defense now. It seems 
almost every defense company is doing that. Is there a smart way and a bad way 
to do it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Obviously the best way to do it, and the way that we've been doing it, is to 
multi-use the technologies. Take our restraint systems, where we have a 
leadership position in military aircraft. We've used that same technology and 
know-how in the commercial cockpit and the passenger seats. We apply the same 
principle in our fire suppression and detection business, with modifications 
that are appropriate. We stayed out of technologies where you can't work both 
sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there anything you're advocating on a national policy level that would 
help manufacturing? 
</P>
<P>
A. You can't have federal and trade deficits go on forever. The quicker one 
addresses those problems, the less chance it will have of being a depressing 
influence in your markets. So we feel Congress and the President really need to 
address that. Not in one day, but they clearly must address the problem. If you 
look at the rest of the world, such as in the East Bloc, you see they will need 
a tremendous amount of capital to develop. We must help them get that capital 
if we are to sell our technologies in their markets. In China, India and 
Western Europe, they will also need capital. We've been generating and using 
capital ourselves for so long, but the rest of the world must develop if we are 
to avoid economic chaos. We have to have a much stronger energy conservation 
and development program than we now have because those are the two areas the 
rest of the world will soon need. 
</P>
<P>
Q. To what extent will Pacific Scientific's sales growth follow the health of 
the economy? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you look at our markets, in utilities it is almost countercyclical. As 
the economy tightens, the utilities try to conserve and therefore tend to want 
devices we sell. In military aerospace, we're in low research areas of the 
business. They will always need seat belts, power supplies and missile devices. 
That will follow the perception of threat in the world. Our only areas that are 
susceptible to economic trends are our instrument business and our particle 
detection business. But in developing today's new products, most research 
companies need clean-room environments and that is what our particle-detection 
business serves. If you look at the world's needs, I don't think the recession 
will last long. I would be surprised if we're still in a downturn by the end of 
1991 because the world markets will drive growth. Since we are worldwide 
manufacturers, we'll participate. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of growth does Pacific Scientific expect in the next year? 
</P>
<P>
A. We expect moderate growth, certainly better than the rate of inflation. If 
the economy doesn't pick up by the end of 1991, the growth will be only 
slightly better than inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What hiring requirements will you have? 
</P>
<P>
AThey won't change much. The implementing of world-class manufacturing concepts 
means we've cut out wasteful activities and so we have less need for new 
people. We've taken care of those cuts through attrition. We have become more 
efficient and so won't need to hire large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see most other manufacturing companies doing the same?

A. Yes. I think the biggest labor changes will occur in the service industries 
as they apply the principles of efficient operations to their own work forces. 
That will probably lead to big changes in Orange County, where companies in the 
service industry become more competitive by applying just-in-time and 
rapid-cycle principles.

Q. What are your thoughts on Japanese competition in manufacturing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the Japanese have done two things in manufacturing that have made 
them dominate the media. Through their government, they have taken a very 
long-term approach in manufacturing. Their cost of capital is far lower, up 
maybe 2% in the last 10 years compared to 10% in the United States. You can't 
compete in a world market with those kinds of differentials. They said they 
would capture electronics by investing in world-class manufacturing concepts 
and being very innovative. They also did a very good public relations job of 
selling the quality of their products. Over the next 10 years they will have a 
difficult time matching the growth of the last decade.

be prospering in these tough times is Pacific Scientific Corp. in Newport 
Beach, an aerospace and industrial instruments maker that has recovered from 
heavy losses in the early 1980s. The company has succeeded by diversifying its 
product mix away from defense, says Edgar S. Brower, chairman and chief 
executive. He talks about how a small-to-medium-size manufacturer can survive 
in today's economic climate. ; Photo, Pacific Scientific's Edgar S. Brower
