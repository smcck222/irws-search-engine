RESTRICTIONS KEEP MIGRANT HOUSING FUNDS IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Half a million dollars sits in a bank account in Sacramento, just waiting to be 
used on desperately needed housing for migrant farm workers in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
And it will continue to sit, as long as a formidable wall of regulations 
separates the money from the people who need it. 
</P>
<P>
The money, as approved in the state budget two months ago, comes with 
restrictions that critics say are utterly impractical. 
</P>
<P>
"That program has so many strings attached to it that it's virtually useless 
for San Diego County," said Oceanside Housing Director Richard Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), the driving force behind the budget 
item, was thrilled last July when Gov. George Deukmejian approved the spending 
blueprint with the $500,000 allotment intact. Frazee remarked at the time that 
it was "nice to win one" after seeing a similar proposal jettisoned last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, early applause for the success of the budget appropriation has given 
way to grumbling by agencies eager to provide housing, but who have discovered 
their plans do not qualify under the state's restrictions on use of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restrictions that make the money difficult to obtain are provisions 
that the funds be used only for permanent structures, which must be built on 
land that is either owned or leased for a minimum of 20 years by the city or 
agency proposing to construct the housing. Also, the housing is for families 
only and is not to be used year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee's staff is back at the drawing board, reviving an Assembly bill to make 
the money more accessible. Frazee reportedly is trying to push the bill through 
the Legislature in the two weeks remaining before the session ends Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Doesn't Qualify 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside, host to an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 migrant laborers each year, has 
a plan for farm worker housing but is ineligible to use the state money, which 
will be disbursed by the state Office of Migrant Services via the Farmworker 
Housing Grant Program. The project would involve leasing trailers directly to 
the farmers to provide shelter for the year-round work force. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been talking with the growers, and we know they are ready, willing and 
able to join us in doing this," Goodman said. "The money has been appropriated, 
and the need is outrageous. But the state has got so many strings on that money 
we can't use it." 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in Sacramento, Goodman said state officials appeared unaware 
that the agricultural areas of San Diego County operate under completely 
different circumstances than the rural farms in California's Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep saying, 'Get some land,' but property here is too valuable and too 
scarce for us to just go out and buy some," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, in a place like Oceanside, the farmland is around where all the 
well-heeled people live," he said. "Getting a high-density apartment complex 
for migrant workers approved would be a political nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
The amended bill would make the money usable for temporary housing for single 
farm workers on a year-round basis and would also seek to set aside $100,000 
for use on a project similar to the one proposed by Oceanside. Though the 
$100,000 would technically be available to any agency with a plan to house 
migrant workers, "for all practical purposes, Oceanside is the only game in 
town unless someone else really moves fast," Frazee's chief of staff, Richard 
Ledford, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portables for Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside plans to purchase portable trailers, then lease them to the growers 
at a nominal rate, probably $1 a year, Goodman said. The growers would be 
responsible for installing water and power lines to the trailers and 
maintaining the units, which would house up to seven people each. The growers 
would have to invest $5,000 to $10,000 for each trailer, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee's bill, AB-617, was already in the works while the budget was being 
hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt 617 was on track," Ledford said. "But our negotiations with the 
administration came out a little more positive than we thought they would. 
Rather than wait for Jan. 1 for the new legislation to take effect, Frazee made 
a decision to see if we could get it in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined we would have the problems with it that we did. In 
retrospect, I wish we had been a little more specific about how the money could 
be spent." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the legislation has been resurrected as a "trailer" bill, intended to 
clean up the details left out by the $500,000 budget appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, AB-617 had successfully cleared the Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee and was being considered on the floor of the state Senate, carried by 
Sen. William Craven, (R-Oceanside), according to Ledford. 
</P>
<P>
The current program does allow for the housing to be built on land in which the 
city has a 20-year "controlling interest," but Goodman said even that provision 
would not be sufficient. "There's no grower that's going to commit his property 
for that long in the future," he said, in light of the rapid pace at which 
farmland is being sold to developers in the North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Their rules and regulations just don't mesh with reality in Southern 
California, especially San Diego County," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Called 'Flexible' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vangundi, state deputy director of housing, defended the state's stance, 
saying the Farmworker Housing Grant Program is "a very flexible program." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the funds are there," he said. "They are for use for farm-worker 
family housing in San Diego, and that's what it will be used for." But the 
local officials who are desirous of using that money have to "reformat their 
thinking," Vangundi said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they wanted to focus on as a solution wasn't going to work," he said, 
referring to Oceanside's trailer plan. The state would balk at allowing the 
trailers to be put on the farmers' property, he said. "We're the lender of the 
taxpayers' money . . . and the taxpayers are not going to be happy about 
putting money on a private landowner's land, if he can turn that site over to 
some other use next year." 
</P>
<P>
"They will need to have that land or long-term control of that land," Vangundi 
said. "That is definitely a major string, but it's one that they are going to 
have to come to grips with." 
</P>
<P>
Vangundi suggested that Oceanside approach Camp Pendleton about obtaining a 
long-term lease for farm-worker housing on the Marine base. The problem of 
farmland being sold to developers was also not insurmountable, he said. "If 
some of that agricultural land converts to residential down the road, it 
doesn't preclude them from still having farm-worker housing there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Purchases OK 
</P>
<P>
Vangundi pointed out that the money may also be used for things besides 
construction, such as site acquisition, feasibility studies and environmental 
reviews, or as a down payment for federal grant programs that require matching 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the way it was written by the legislative staffers, the thing kind 
of got a little bit garbled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional misunderstandings may have occurred because the state defines 
"migrant workers" as laborers who migrate from crop to crop, not as migrants 
from Mexico or other countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent difficulties, Vangundi said, "We're not giving up. There's 
going to be a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials, unconvinced that the state is on their side, are now relying 
on Frazee's efforts to help them obtain the money. 
</P>
<P>
Though Oceanside appears to be the front-runner for state funding, other social 
service agencies in North County are moving ahead with plans to build housing 
for farm workers with or without the state money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valley Center Site Possible 
</P>
<P>
Amy Rowland, director of the North County Housing Foundation, said her 
nonprofit organization has been working on plans to establish farm-worker 
housing in Valley Center or in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Center plan, however, has stalled because of the difficulty of 
finding an appropriate site, she said. Most of Valley Center is under a 
county-mandated building moratorium because the high ground-water level has led 
to problems with the septic systems. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to find a site yet, but no matter where we build, it's 
going to be used," she said. "There's enough need out there to do hundreds of 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland said she is considering the state money as one possible source for 
financing the Valley Center project but has not been encouraged by reports of 
the inaccessibility of the money. "It looks like the way that funding is 
allocated currently it would be tough to use in San Diego in any way that would 
make sense," she said. "I think whoever uses the money, it's going to have to 
be coupled with other resources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Project Planned 
</P>
<P>
The North County Chaplaincy is also moving ahead on a housing project in the 
Encinitas area and probably will apply for a share of the state money, 
spokeswoman Millie Gordon said. "We've got everything taken care of," Gordon 
said. "We're just now going insane trying to find funding." 
</P>
<P>
The Chaplaincy project will utilize prefabricated units that will house eight 
people each, and arrangements already have been made to lease land and provide 
utilities and social services, Gordon said. The housing will be open to farm 
workers, immigrants and the general homeless population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is money," Gordon said. "With $250,000, we could set up 20 
families, up to 100 individuals, in their own homes within a month." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Rodriguez, county housing department chief, said the county supports 
the nonprofit agencies in their quest for the state funds. The county itself 
does not have any proposals to build farm-worker housing, he said.

University students in Colombia have taken to the streets to protest the 
drug-related violence that has become endemic in their country. An article in 
The Times reported that one of the banners carried by students read, "If You 
Have Consumed Drugs, You Killed (Luis) Galan" (the Colombian presidential 
candidate killed Aug. 18). These words are true for anyone who has ever used 
illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The United States provides the monstrous market for these drugs and therefore 
is directly responsible for the drug-related carnage in Colombia. Every time 
one of us uses cocaine or marijuana, he or she perpetuates this virulent 
market.

CARDINAL GLEMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The distressing and arrogant remarks by Polish Cardinal (Jozef) Glemp at 
Czestochowa were brilliantly challenged in The Times' editorial of Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years since the beginning of World War II, many horrible crimes have 
been perpetrated against mankind; among those crimes was the attempted genocide 
of the Jewish people. But, since the ending of that war, many things have 
changed in the world. Among the good changes has been the evidence that 
concerned people of all backgrounds will no longer remain silent in the face of 
bigotry and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp's dangerous and destructive use of anti-Jewish stereotypes tends to 
encourage Jews and Poles, two of the Nazis' greatest victim peoples, toward 
mutual antagonism. By choosing to use a number of discredited canards, he has 
done great harm to the cause of positive Catholic-Jewish relations. Moreover, 
he has made a just solution to the Auschwitz convent conflict more difficult to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Cardinal Glemp failed to mention the joint Catholic-Jewish 
agreement of 1987, which provides for a fair resolution of the convent 
controversy. Indeed, abrogation of this understanding by Polish bishops has 
been challenged by others in the Catholic hierarchy who were parties to the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate criticism of the Cardinal's remarks by the Solidarity newspaper 
is warmly welcomed. It clearly reveals the critical decision that newly 
emerging democratic Poland now faces: whether to revert to a backward-looking 
and biased view of Jews and Judaism, or move instead to the new higher ground 
of mutual understanding and respect between Catholics and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, Cardinal Glemp has chosen the first course of action, and Poland is 
the loser. 
</P>
<P>
The American Jewish Committee remains committed to the strengthening of Polish 
Catholic-Jewish relations, and will continue to build that relationship with 
partners who seek the same goal.

As indicated in the editorial "Attack on Drug Kings" (Aug. 22), the murder of 
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan has galvanized Colombians into waging all-out war 
against Colombian drug lords. Let's hope they succeed. It won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
No body of terrorists should be allowed to control the government of Colombia. 
These drug kings must be captured, extradited to the United States and put on 
trial. As mentioned before, this won't be easy, but it can be done if Colombia 
and the United States can work together.

CORRECTING AN OMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State redevelopment law specifies how communities must spend 20% of the 
revenues that result from increases in property taxes assessed against new 
developments in redevelopment areas. The money must be set aside for low- or 
moderate-income housing. A number of communities ignore that section of the law 
or skirt it by building housing that is affordable for young professionals and 
senior citizens but is well beyond the reach of very poor families. A bill 
sponsored by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) would correct the 
omission. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, AB 2080, would set new redevelopment policy. Communities that 
benefit from redevelopment would be directed to use housing funds in proportion 
to the need in an area. If the greatest need is for modest apartments for poor 
families -- as it is in Southern California -- most of the funds would be spent 
on that kind of housing. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is expected to come before the Senate late this week, would 
also require redevelopment agencies to replace 75% of the housing destroyed by 
new development. The lost housing would be replaced with similarly affordable 
housing. That is an important requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Replacement based on affordability would prevent redevelopment agencies from 
replacing a large apartment that rents for $350 a month and is affordable for a 
family living on welfare or the minimum wage with a smaller apartment that 
rents for $650 a month and is affordable for a single person earning what is 
considered a moderate income, as high as $32,000 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The new requirement would slow the disappearance of housing at the lowest end 
of the market. Redevelopment agencies anticipate displacing 1,364 households 
statewide over the next fiscal year, and 76% of those families would be 
classified as low or very low income. That type of housing is needed most 
critically, and it is hardest to replace. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement provision tied to affordability is also important because of 
the large gap between moderate and very low income. In Los Angeles County, 
moderate income is as high as $45,600 for a family of four; very low income for 
a similar family is put at $19,950. In Orange County, moderate income is even 
higher, $56,300 for a family of four; very low income for the same size family 
is set at $23,450, based on federal poverty standards. What really counts, 
however, is how much families can afford to pay for housing, and if decent 
housing is available. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment, in essence, removes slums and blight. That task can be 
accomplished without shrinking the availability of very-low-income housing. The 
Waters bill would direct cities that enjoy the benefits of commercial 
redevelopment to spend the housing money where it belongs, that is, where the 
housing needs are the greatest. The measure merits passage.

DEFINITELY WORTH A TOAST! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State lawmakers and Gov. George Deukmejian can give recycling a boost, 
discourage litterbugs and take some pressure off clogged landfills by raising 
the redemption rate on empty soda bottles and beer cans. The current payoff of 
a penny is too small to persuade consumers to hoard empty containers for the 
recycler rather than toss them in the trash. A nickel reward -- the standard in 
states where bottle laws work best -- would provide a stronger incentive. 
</P>
<P>
A bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would increase the 
redemption rate to two-for-a-nickel on bottles and cans that contain fewer than 
24 ounces. The measure, SB 1221, would boost the rate to a full 5 cents on 
larger beverage containers, including the popular and cumbersome 2-liter 
bottles. The measure is expected to come up before the Assembly this week. It 
merits swift passage. 
</P>
<P>
Passage followed by the governor's approval would guarantee the higher rate as 
of Jan. 1. The new law would also boost the pay-offs to a full nickel per small 
can or bottle and a dime per larger bottle as of Jan. 1, 1993 -- but only if 
the return rates fail to reach the mandatory 65% for aluminum, glass and 
plastic containers, the standard set two years ago by the original bottle 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Summer return rates -- when beverage consumption is at its highest -- are due 
from the state Conservation Department on Friday. Although a high rate is 
expected for aluminum cans, the containers with the highest scrap value, the 
level is not expected to approach the mark for glass or plastic containers. 
State return rates were 57% for cans, 33% for glass bottles and 5% for plastic 
containers during the last reporting period ending Dec. 31. That is a mediocre 
showing when compared to the 90% return rates in states that have established a 
nickel refund. 
</P>
<P>
Californians drink 12 billion beers and soft drinks in a typical year. How many 
of those empty bottles and cans wind up as litter on our parks, beaches and 
roads or in municipal landfills that are running out of room? Recycling every 
empty container would dramatically reduce litter and energy consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who are willing to return a six-pack of empties to a recycling depot 
deserve more than a fistful of pennies for their effort. The California 
Assembly and the governor should approve the nickel reward.

<TEXT>
<P>
My mother was born in Colombia. I have visited that great country on one 
occasion and I was very impressed with the sense of serenity and happiness of 
its citizens. Now the people are cowering, praying that the scourge of the 
narco-traffickers will end. 
</P>
<P>
I appeal to the citizens of this country, although not as eloquently as 
President Barco in his sobering world-wide appeal, that American drug users 
look into their hearts and know with each sorry sniff of cocaine it equates to 
a vote for repression and torture. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia suffers today because the coca plant is indigenous to the land; it 
grows without much nurturing or tending. For years the medicinal properties of 
cocaine were used for toothaches, pains, and the such. Colombians, by and 
large, are not afflicted with cocaine addiction. 
</P>
<P>
How I loathe the insolent attitude of all the crack smokers and cocaine 
sniffers. You are the cause of an entire nation's potential demise.

REVERENT RESTORATION;

<P>
TINY RAMONA CHAPEL, STEEPED IN HISTORY, GETS A FACE LIFT IN NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gary Cooper became an honorary Sioux there. Rudy Vallee -- by some accounts -- 
said his wedding vows there. 
</P>
<P>
But the people who visit Ramona Chapel in Heritage Square in Newhall probably 
know little of the stories and myths surrounding the tiny wooden building 
which, like a tattered wedding dress, displays a faded loveliness. Most people 
are drawn to the chapel simply because it is unique and charming. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem to get a lot of attention," said Bob Diem, who is overseeing the 
chapel's restoration for the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society. The 
chapel, built about 1925, is perhaps the most popular attraction at Heritage 
Square, a collection of antique buildings maintained by the society. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one that attracts people right away," said Paul Kruetzer, society 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a delightful little building," said Jerry Reynolds, another society 
member. "I wish it were twice as big as it was. It seats about 12 -- if they're 
friendly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell for Ringing 
</P>
<P>
Part of its attraction, Kruetzer said, is the spire's bell, which people ring 
by yanking a rope hanging down the side of the building. Newly engaged couples 
often ask when the restoration work will be completed. "They want to get 
married in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The couples will have a long wait. The society began restoring the outside of 
the chapel this summer and poured a concrete base for the wooden steps last 
week. The group hopes to complete the work by December, Diem said. Fixing the 
inside, which has suffered from years of neglect, will take longer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chapel was built for Callahan's Mission Village, an early theme park of 
sorts that was located where the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways 
intersect southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Reynolds said it was designed by 
Carrie Jacobs Bond, a well-known songwriter of the era who composed "I Love You 
Truly," "The End of a Perfect Day" and other "soggy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The chapel was used for weddings and as a movie set but was not used for 
regular religious services. Rudy Vallee supposedly was married there, but 
Reynolds said he hasn't confirmed that story. But it is true that the park's 
owner, Robert Callahan, who was part Indian, had Gary Cooper officially 
inducted into the Sioux Nation at the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have pictures of Gary Cooper there with his war bonnet on," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chapel Was Showpiece 
</P>
<P>
It's also true that the village was "quite the spot for the movie crowd in the 
'20s," Reynolds said. And the showpiece of the village was the Ramona Chapel, 
Kruetzer said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Santa Monica Freeway displaced the village in 1962, Callahan had the 
chapel carted off to Canyon Country to create a new theme park along Sierra 
Highway. Callahan was hit by a train two years later and, although he lived 
until 1981, his health faltered and the Canyon Country park went into decline. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan's widow donated the chapel to the society, which trucked it to the 
Newhall park in 1987. The move will be long remembered by the historical 
society. 
</P>
<P>
"We lifted it up and, holy cow, this swarm of bees came out of there," Reynolds 
said. "People scattered in all different directions." The movers promptly 
bought several cans of bee repellent. "It took half a day to get the bees out," 
Kruetzer said.

HISTORY OF SECRECY, PROBLEMS CLOUD ROCKWELL'S CLAIMS OF NUCLEAR SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its fight to strengthen its credibility and assure the public about the 
safety of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Rockwell International might 
consider the case of William Lane. 
</P>
<P>
The Canoga Park man was 22 in 1959 when he became a radiation safety officer at 
Santa Susana, the research site west of Chatsworth where Rockwell does nuclear 
work for the federal government. Lane was still a young man 18 years later when 
he learned he had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
After Lane grew deathly ill, his family filed a workers compensation claim, 
blaming the illness on radiation exposure. Lane died in May, 1986, at the age 
of 49. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after Lane's death, Marlin E. Remley, director of nuclear safety 
and licensing for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, told San Fernando Valley 
members of the National Council of Jewish Women the company had "never had a 
radioactive injury, a permanent radioactive injury." 
</P>
<P>
But Rockwell later paid the Lane family a $90,000 settlement -- a large sum for 
a compensation case -- because doctors for the company agreed that radiation 
exposure probably caused or contributed to Lane's death, the case file shows. 
The company also has paid smaller settlements in four other cases of alleged 
radiation-induced cancer, according to figures supplied by Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scoffs at Cancer Link 
</P>
<P>
Settlements are not admissions of responsibility. And Remley, who retired in 
January, maintained in a recent interview that radiation exposures at 
Rocketdyne were so low that "I seriously question whether anyone has really 
suffered cancer because of radiation exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some Rockwell critics look back with scorn at Remley's presentation. 
"It's very obvious that they lied to us" about the safety of Santa Susana, 
Jeanne Londe, an officer of the Jewish women's council who attended Remley's 
talk, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
To Londe and other critics, questions about Rockwell's credibility and 
contamination at Santa Susana have become almost inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
The big blow came in May with disclosure of a U.S. Department of Energy report 
on radioactive and chemical contamination at the test lab. Many residents 
refused to believe that conditions there did not pose an immediate health 
threat, despite assurances from Energy Department, Rockwell and independent 
state and federal agencies. Among other things, the report made clear that more 
nuclear work had gone on at the site than the public had been told. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's why we're all concerned," said Milena Miller of Reseda, who is 
fighting renewal of the Santa Susana lab's license to recycle nuclear fuel. "If 
we thought they'd been honest . . . we wouldn't be pursuing this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Factors 
</P>
<P>
Interviews and a review of government records and news accounts suggest various 
factors helped create the climate of mistrust, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Statements by company officials that came back to bite them, such as Remley's 
remark. The company's cause was not helped by allegations of pollution and 
deception at two other Rockwell-Energy Department operations -- the Rocky Flats 
nuclear weapons plant near Denver and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
* Company reticence about the nuclear side of its business. While basking in 
favorable publicity about its work in the nation's space program, Rockwell over 
the years divulged much less information about its nuclear activities. Although 
press clippings show the company's nuclear mission received occasional 
coverage, the company rarely volunteered information and publicity was 
intermittent -- partly reflecting secrecy concerns of Rockwell's customer, the 
Atomic Energy Commission (later, the Energy Department). 
</P>
<P>
* Statements by health and environmental regulators who accused Rockwell of 
failing to tell them about its nuclear work, even though the statements are in 
some instances contradicted by documents on file in their agencies. Put on the 
spot by newspaper reporters, some officials may have given hasty answers 
without knowing or remembering what Rockwell had told them in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rockwell was partly immune from regulation and arguably not required to 
keep the agencies fully informed. Still, the situation was seen by some as 
evidence of a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Have Commitment' 
</P>
<P>
Pat Coulter, spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, said the company 
never sought to mislead anyone. "We have a commitment to keep the public 
informed, and we're going to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A general distrust of things nuclear is also part of the company's predicament. 
For years, government weapons production and nuclear research was shielded from 
publicity and largely immune to many environmental rules facing other 
industries. As these operations have been dragged into the spotlight, many 
environmental groups, citizens and congressmen have not liked what they've 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockwell definitely seems to have had more than its share of problems," said 
Jim Werner, a project engineer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group. But "the fact that they're working for the Department of 
Energy is more than a small contributor" to those problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the Department of Energy's secrecy in weapons production, they and 
their contractors have also been less than up front about environmental 
problems," Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power was born in secrecy during World War II in the race to build the 
first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
As late as 1952, when Rockwell's predecessor firm, North American Aviation Co., 
started up California's first atomic reactor in Downey, the small test plant 
initially was classified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Satellite Program 
</P>
<P>
A few years later at Santa Susana, the company developed the first of several 
SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) reactors, which were intended to 
provide power for spy satellites, a company official said. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, "all nuclear reactors were born classified," said Bob 
Tuttle, Rocketdyne radiation and nuclear safety manager, who joined the company 
in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us had top-level clearances from the AEC," Tuttle said, refering to the 
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. "We were taught, instructed, not to talk about 
our work. . . . The philosophy of not divulging information I'm sure was 
thoroughly ingrained in our top people, and the public relations people," 
Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the attitude carried over to later years. "Information has always been 
available," said Tuttle, but the company "didn't push it on people." 
</P>
<P>
A tradition of secrecy was reinforced by growing public distrust of atomic 
power, even before Three Mile Island or Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
Court cases and news reports disclosed that American soldiers had been marched 
into the desert after nuclear blasts to see how they'd react. And clusters of 
cancer and leukemia appeared in downwind communities, where residents weren't 
warned to take precautions following atomic tests. Meanwhile, government and 
the nuclear industry struggled unsuccessfully to find a safe means to dispose 
of high-level radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Negative' Stories 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne spokesman Paul Sewell, who managed the National Atomic Museum in 
Albuquerque for a time in the 1970s, recalled that whenever a reporter came to 
do a story on the museum, there was always a good chance "it was going to be a 
negative story." 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials, put on the defensive, usually took a low profile, reasoning 
that little good could come of saying more than was necessary. In this 
atmosphere, a serious nuclear accident at Santa Susana in 1959 was not widely 
publicized for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The accident involved the so-called "sodium reactor experiment," the first 
nuclear reactor in the country to produce electricity for a commercial power 
grid. Dedication ceremonies in November, 1957, "attracted many high-ranking 
government and industrial leaders," according to an account in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But the accident, in which 13 of 43 nuclear fuel rods ruptured or partially 
melted, did not make a blip on the public radar until 1979, when an 
anti-nuclear group released records obtained under the Freedom of Information 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
The Atomic Energy Commission and North American Aviation issued a press release 
following the accident in the summer of 1959. But the two-page statement was so 
technical that it was widely ignored. Words such as "accident" and "meltdown" 
were not used. The release gave no hint that the commission had criticized the 
company for continuing to run the reactor despite weeks of abnormal operation, 
as records later showed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Mentioned in Report 
</P>
<P>
The accident also was blacked out of a 1983 report by Rockwell to the Energy 
Department on decommissioning and cleanup of the sodium reactor. A section on 
historical highlights of the project made no mention of the accident. During 
the 1950s, at least a dozen newspaper articles discussed Santa Susana's 
emergence as a nuclear reactor site. Much later, in 1981, a news story said a 
safety analysis commissioned by Ventura County officials found that Santa 
Susana workers and the public were adequately protected from radiation hazards. 
It would be ludicrous to suggest that the nuclear side of Rocketdyne's work 
stayed hidden, company spokesman Paul Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, publicity about that work has been minuscule compared 
to that focused on Rockwell's involvement in the space program. Almost everyone 
knew Rockwell built and tested engines for the space shuttle. But many people 
didn't know the firm had run more than a dozen nuclear reactors and produced 
and recycled nuclear fuel at the same sites. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Rockwell made news because of pollution, it was linked to non-nuclear 
work. News articles in recent years told how the company, under orders from 
state health agencies, was attempting to clean up ground water pollution from 
chemical solvents that were used to rinse rocket engines. But the issue of 
radioactive pollution was rarely raised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cover-Up Charged 
</P>
<P>
Controversy engulfed Santa Susana in May after the Los Angeles Daily News wrote 
the first of many front page articles about the Energy Department report on 
contamination at Santa Susana. Subsequent stories suggested a cover-up, stating 
that health and environmental agencies were unaware of the extent of nuclear 
work at the site. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their ignorance may not have been as surprising or as complete as the 
stories suggested. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, nuclear safety at the lab was beyond the jurisdiction of most 
environmental agencies, so Rockwell wasn't always obliged to keep them fully 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, correspondence suggests that the agencies knew at least enough to 
have asked pointed questions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the toxic substances control division of the state Department of 
Health Services were among those who said they knew nothing of Rocketdyne's 
nuclear work. But their off-the-cuff remarks were at odds with their own files. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us were a little bit surprised at first, . . . but quite a few of us 
are new to the division," said Scott Simpson, enforcement chief for the 
division's regional office in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspectors Knew 
</P>
<P>
From a review of inspection reports "it becomes pretty clear" that agency 
inspectors knew part of Santa Susana "was a DOE nuclear power-type research 
facility" that they assumed they "didn't have authority over," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board was another agency that 
complained it had been kept in the dark. The board was working with Rockwell on 
the cleanup of non-nuclear areas of the Santa Susana site, where chemical 
solvents had leaked into ground water. At the direction of the regional board, 
Rockwell periodically tested off-site wells and springs for solvents and 
reported the data to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was unknown to the regional board, Rockwell also was testing the 
well water for radioactivity, finding no evidence that any had migrated from 
the site. But the regional board had not asked for radioactivity measurements 
and apparently did not know the company was taking them. Instead, Rockwell 
shared the data with the Department of Health Services' radiological health 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
Regional board officials expressed indignation when they learned of the 
radioactivity testing in May. Rockwell and the Energy Department should have 
volunteered the data, if only as a professional courtesy, Hank Yacoub, a senior 
engineer with the regional board, said later. "You know we don't have the 
resources" to police everyone, Yacoub said. "Without the cooperation of 
industry," he said, the agency "is going to be totally ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Records Show Otherwise 
</P>
<P>
But records show the board should not have been completely in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in a letter to the regional board in October, 1981, a lawyer for 
residents of Bell Canyon near Santa Susana expressed concern about possible 
radioactive discharges into Bell Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Regional board files show that Raymond Hertel, then executive officer for the 
agency, replied that the discharges were being monitored by Rockwell and 
contained no radioactive pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell "conducts some very low-level radioactive operations" at Santa Susana, 
according to Hertel's letter in December, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Then in May, 1986, Rockwell told the board in a letter why it couldn't test 
ground water for chemical pollution in a particular area of Santa Susana. As 
the letter disclosed, "a small space power reactor" formerly was housed in a 
building in that area, and water seeping into the basement had become 
contaminated by radioactive cobalt 60. 
</P>
<P>
If the company pumped ground water for chemical tests, this might cause the 
"cobalt 60 contaminated water to exit the basement," the letter explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't See Letter 
</P>
<P>
The letter was addressed to Yacoub, but he said he never saw it and that it was 
dated at a time he was on vacation. In any case, he said, the letter was a 
"very vague" and "perhaps even a sneaky way of addressing the issue of 
radioactivity." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell denies there was anything sneaky about the letter. Besides, "the 
radioactivity was out of that agency's jurisdiction," Tuttle said. "I think the 
appropriate agencies were always fully informed of what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
The regional water board and health services department may have the last word, 
however. Both agencies are investigating whether Rockwell violated state laws 
by failing to obtain permits for some waste treatment and disposal operations 
at Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
Also fueling the credibility issue were sensational allegations about two other 
Rockwell-Energy Department sites: Hanford and Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1987, Rockwell operated the plutonium processing plants at the giant 
Hanford atomic weapons complex in eastern Washington. A recent report by the 
House subcommittee on oversight and investigations told how Rockwell prepared 
for a visit to Hanford by Washington's governor in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Removed 
</P>
<P>
As the governor's party approached a contaminated area, "signs which warned of 
the radiation hazard were removed . . . on direct orders from Rockwell Hanford 
Operations management . . ." said the June, 1989, report. 
</P>
<P>
"A part of the governor's entourage passed right through the contaminated area, 
oblivious of the hazard around them," the report said. "Rockwell covered up 
this incident for almost one year until the matter came to the attention of the 
media and the subcommittee." 
</P>
<P>
And at Rocky Flats northwest of Denver, operated by Rockwell for the Energy 
Department, a special federal grand jury is weighing evidence of possible 
criminal violations of environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Flats opened in 1952 to produce plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs. 
For more than two decades it was run by Dow Chemical, before Rockwell took over 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
During Dow's tenure, an atmospheric scientist discovered higher levels of 
plutonium in soil downwind from the plant than in upwind areas. Dow had 
secretly buried hundreds of barrels of radioactively contaminated lathe oil, 
which was leaking into soil and being scattered by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minutes of Meeting 
</P>
<P>
With the source of the contamination sure to be discovered, Dow officials met 
to discuss a program of damage control. According to minutes of a April 3, 
1970, meeting, filed as an exhibit in subsequent court cases, one Dow official 
asked: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you suppose we ought to sneak an article in the paper saying recovery 
operations have started if that is what we decide to do? Or should we wait 
until they find out and then admit we're up to something?" 
</P>
<P>
"We probably don't even know who it was who made the decision to bury the 
God-damned stuff," said a second official. 
</P>
<P>
"We can always blame it on Venable," said a third, mentioning a Dow official 
who had been transfered to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll drink to that," the second man said. 
</P>
<P>
After Dow, Rockwell came on the scene as something of a white knight. But there 
were problems on its watch, culminating in an extraordinary raid in June by 
dozens of FBI agents and Environmental Protection Agency officials seeking 
evidence of possible criminal violations of hazardous waste and clean water 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a 116-page affidavit supporting the warrant request, the FBI said there was 
"probable cause to believe" that Rocky Flats officials had "illegally operated 
. . . an outdated and unpermitted" hazardous waste incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memo Differs 
</P>
<P>
In addition, although Rockwell and Energy Department officials from the early 
to mid-1980s "repeatedly stated to the public and certified to government 
agencies that Rocky Flats was in compliance with federal and state 
environmental laws," an internal Energy Department memo told a different story, 
the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the July, 1986, memo, Rocky Flats was "in poor condition generally 
in terms of environmental compliance." Some of its waste facilities were 
"patently 'illegal,' " the FBI quoted the memo as saying. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement, Sam F. Iacobellis, president of Rockwell's aerospace 
division, which includes Rocky Flats, said Rocky Flats officials "have not and 
will not subordinate health and safety . . . to production requirements." 
</P>
<P>
He said "the hard evidence we have seen thus far indicates the incinerators 
were not operated on the dates alleged or otherwise illegally." 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne spokesman Pat Coulter said it's unfair to link problems at Rocky 
Flats with Rocketdyne's operations here. Rocky Flats "is a different facility 
run by different people with a different mission," according to Coulter. He 
said that at Rocketdyne, there is a "commitment on behalf of the most senior 
management to run their business safely and ethically."

OUTSIDE NBC, WALK OF FAME IS TO FLOYD JACKSON'S SHOE STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Floyd Jackson is the only person who knows what it's like to be in my shoes," 
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC, once joked. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, since he opened his shoeshine business at NBC studios in Burbank 
in 1951, Jackson has worked on a lot of big shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to shine Bob Hope, Flip Wilson and Dinah Shore," said Jackson, who over 
the years has decorated the walls of his shoeshine stand with pictures of some 
of his most famous customers. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 50 years of shining for the stars, Jackson himself has become 
something of a celebrity. "Floyd's Place" is a regular stop on the NBC tour, 
and a booklet chronicling Jackson's career at NBC is available at the studio 
gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
His regular clientele includes most of the guests who appear on "The Tonight 
Show" as well as the show's star, Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in 1930s 
</P>
<P>
Now 80, Jackson started shining shoes in the early 1930s at the swank Rice 
Hotel in Houston. Among his first celebrity customers was John Wayne. But many 
were Texas millionaires, such as former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. 
Jones. Or oilman Glenn McCarthy, whose life inspired the best-selling novel 
"Giant" and the 1965 movie of the same title starring James Dean, Elizabeth 
Taylor and Rock Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
It was McCarthy, Jackson said, who in 1947 offered to bring him to Los Angeles 
aboard his private airplane. The "King of the Wildcatters," as McCarthy was 
known, had just built the $21-million, 18-story Shamrock Hotel in Houston and 
was coming to Hollywood to arrange for several movie stars to appear at the 
hotel's grand opening, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn was one of the biggest fellas in Houston," Jackson said. "He liked me to 
be around him because I had a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he and his family had been planning to move to the West Coast for 
awhile, and soon after arriving he sent for his wife, Corine, whose mother 
lived in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For a few years, Jackson carried a portable shoeshine stand all over Hollywood 
hunting down business. "I used to go around to all the studios -- Warner Bros., 
MGM, Universal Studios, ABC and NBC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also moonlighted as a custodian at Universal, a job he kept until 1971. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stand at NBC 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he saved enough money to buy a regular shine stand, which NBC 
allowed him to set up rent-free on the loading dock of the company's old 
studios at Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
When NBC moved from Hollywood to Burbank in 1951, Jackson went along. Today, 
Floyd's Place is located outside Studio One, where "The Tonight Show" is taped. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things Floyd is famous for is shining the shoes of all the people 
who appear on the 'Tonight Show,' " said NBC spokeswoman Pat Schultz. "It's 
become a good luck gesture for guests to have their shoes shined by Floyd 
before appearing on the show." 
</P>
<P>
The late night talk show's entire cast, including Carson, are frequent 
customers, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny never comes out and gets his shine on the stand," Jackson said. 
"Sometimes he'll be in makeup, and I'll come in and he'll talk to me. Or I'll 
go down and pick up his shoes in his dressing room and he'll say, 'Howdy.' He's 
a good man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100 Tip 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's most famous customers have included former President Ronald Reagan 
and Frank Sinatra, who several years ago gave the shoeshine operator his first 
$100 tip. His second came last week -- from blues guitarist B. B. King. 
</P>
<P>
One of Jackson's favorite stories is about the $99 tip he got from Spanish 
tenor Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting a shine, and an NBC tour came by and told about Frank giving me 
a $100," Jackson said. "When Placido got off the stand, he said, 'Floyd, give 
me a dollar.' So I gave him a dollar, and he handed me a $100 bill." 
</P>
<P>
The singer explained to Jackson: "Me and Frank are very good friends, and I 
don't want to out-tip Frank." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said his worst tipper was former President Richard Nixon, who as vice 
president told his Secret Service escort to tip Jackson 50 cents. But Jackson 
said he doesn't blame Nixon. "I knew the vice president never carries money 
with him," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Jackson himself has appeared on television. He said he has been 
on "Laugh-In," "Real People" and "David Letterman," as well as "The Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stargazer 
</P>
<P>
In light of those experiences, Jackson said he is long past the stargazing 
stage and doesn't get excited at meeting celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a warm place in his heart for those in the entertainment business. 
"Show people are the greatest people on earth," Jackson said. "I just love 
them." 
</P>
<P>
NBC executives say that over the years Jackson's joviality has brightened the 
lives of studio employees. "Floyd's an institution," said Donald Zachary, vice 
president of NBC's West Coast operations. "He's always got a smile and a good 
word for everybody. He's well loved." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zachary said, "NBC executives have the shiniest shoes in town." 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired officially last year, Jackson said he has had a hard time 
finding a reliable replacement. He works whenever he feels like it. 
</P>
<P>
NBC officials have promised Jackson that when he leaves, "Floyd's Place" will 
remain a regular stop on the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it, and you know I never heard of a shine man being a star," 
Jackson said. "I'm not bragging about it, but I made my own self a star."

A San Diego cabdriver died early Sunday after his cab struck a vehicle on the 
shoulder of Interstate 5, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Jack Parker, 53, of the 700 block of 11th Avenue, died at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla at 8:15 a.m., an hour after the crash north of 
Leucadia Boulevard, Deputy Coroner George Dickason said. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers were riding in the cab when it veered out of control while going 
an estimated 80 m.p.h. and hit a pickup parked along the shoulder, said Mike 
Collier, a dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Gutierrez, 19, was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was listed 
in serious condition Sunday afternoon. Soloman Modano, 45, was listed in fair 
condition at Sharp Memorial. The driver and a passenger in the parked pickup 
escaped with minor injuries, Collier said.

A fiery explosion ripped through an underground oil tank at a Kearny Mesa 
asphalt plant Sunday, seriously injuring one worker, a Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The worker, who was not identified, was filling an adjacent tank using a 
solvent and a heating device when the solvent caught fire and touched off the 
blast at 3:58 p.m., spokesman Jon MacDonald said. The victim was reported in 
serious condition with neck and chest burns at the UC San Diego Medical Center 
burn unit. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters allowed the two-alarm fire, at the Sims Harris plant in the 9200 
block of Kearny Villa Road, to burn itself out in the partially filled tank 
before sealing the vessel, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil is used in the manufacture of asphalt. Heating devices and solvents 
are used to keep the asphalt flowing through the underground tanks.

SAN FERNANDO MAN DIES DURING BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 66-year-old San Fernando man died Sunday during a fire that authorities 
believe was started by a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was not identified, apparently had been smoking and either fell 
asleep or had lapsed into unconsciousness while sitting in a chair in his 
living room, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. It was 
unclear whether the victim, who suffered from diabetes, had died as a result of 
the fire, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was inside the house, in the 1100 block of West Griffith Street, 
when the fire broke out shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
It took 12 firefighters about 15 minutes to extinguish the blaze, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
No other injuries were reported. Damage to the house and its contents was 
estimated at $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo said an autopsy will be performed on the victim to determine the cause 
of his death.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HAD A WAY ABOUT HIM -- HIS WAY OR THE HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In San Francisco, a number of 49ers have put the knock on former coach Bill 
Walsh for his austere and autocratic ways, but Roger Craig is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
Craig told the New York Times: "Bill had a great presence, great charisma. He 
would walk into the locker room, and the whole atmosphere would change. He had 
that glow about him, the glow of a champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd be so prepared that he'd work on a game plan and pretty much have it 
ready two or three weeks before the game. There were games where he'd walk up 
to me before kickoff and say, 'We need 100 yards from you today,' and that was 
it. I'd bust my tail even harder to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Going for the green: From Richard Justice of the Washington Post: "Pete Rose, 
whose legal fees are thought to be running well over $1 million, was paid 
$75,000 per night for those two appearances on that Minneapolis shopping cable 
network last week. The station is believed to have sold about $600,000 of Rose 
memorabilia." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Good Guy: Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees told Michael Kay of the New 
York Daily News why he doesn't do card shows: "This guy is working all week and 
he brings his son to this show, has to pay $2 to get in, maybe $5 for a 
picture, and then $6 for an autograph. These guys have to think you're a real 
ass, with your head down all the time signing. I can see why players do these 
shows, but in my opinion it makes the player look bad." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: A Chicago columnist, claiming the Bears are doomed with two Big 
Ten quarterbacks, Mike Tomczak (Ohio State) and Jim Harbaugh (Michigan), asked: 
"When's the last time someone's gone to the Super Bowl with two Big Ten 
quarterbacks?" What's the answer? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Bombs away: From Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe: "The last time San 
Francisco was in Chicago, a man who was there saw the Giants' Kevin Mitchell 
hit six consecutive batting practice pitches out of Wrigley Field and onto 
Waveland Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The survivor: Says 34-year-old New England fullback Mosi Tatupu, who blocked 
for Anthony Davis and Charles White at USC: "They were first-round picks. Now 
they're out of football and I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: San Jose columnist Mark Purdy, on the proposed site for a new ballpark in 
San Francisco: "It's the real estate equivalent of a clogged toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas face-lift: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post, on the new Dallas 
Cowboys: "There has been progress already. The Cowboys were always viewed as a 
progressive, almost futuristic organization. But in truth the scouting 
department had fallen so far behind that one man (the fired Gil Brandt) was 
doing the work that most clubs had three men doing (college scouting, pro 
scouting, negotiating player contracts)." 
</P>
<P>
Does it all: From the Atlanta Journal: "Randall Cunningham of the Philadelphia 
Eagles, arguably the NFL's finest quarterback, branched out a bit at practice 
last week by kicking a 48-yard field goal." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Miami Dolphins of 1972 and 1973 were Super Bowl winners with 
Bob Griese (Purdue) and Earl Morrall (Michigan State) at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Tom Paciorek, Chicago White Sox announcer, asked his definition of 
boredom: "Having to listen to someone talking about themselves when when I want 
to talk about me."

DEL MAR DEBUTANTE; 
</P>
<P>
LONGSHOT RUE DE PALM CAPS LUKAS' DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His victory with Steinlen in the Arlington Million was special, but it was 
business as usual for Wayne Lukas at Del Mar on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Four hours after Steinlen's victory in suburban Chicago, Lukas saddled Peter 
Brant's Rue de Palm to win the $310,050 Debutante by six lengths in a 
stakes-equaling 1:35 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
Rue de Palm paid $40.80, $17.60 and $9 in the biggest Debutante upset since 
Bubblewin shocked Miss Tokyo at 14-1 in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas, winning the race for 2-year-old fillies for the sixth time in the last 
seven years, indicated that Rue de Palm might come right back in the Sept. 13 
Del Mar Futurity against colts. 
</P>
<P>
Rue de Palm, a maiden barely a month ago, might be up to the task. And two 
weeks earlier she had been banished to the veterinarian's list for throwing a 
fit in the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
The incident prevented Rue de Palm from running in a prep for the Debutante and 
prompted an almost daily gate-schooling session by Lukas and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of embarrassing," Lukas said after watching Rue de Palm led from 
the winner's circle. "Good gate horses used to be my strong suit. But she had 
come around so good I think we could have gotten somebody out of the crowd to 
load her today." 
</P>
<P>
Good gate horses helped make Lukas the most successful quarter horse trainer in 
history before he turned to thoroughbreds full time in 1977. Since then he has 
become known as the man who dominates the filly division with wave after wave 
of well-bred stock, most of them bought at public auction. Five of his eight 
Debutante winners have come out of such sales, including champion Landaluce. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas had this version of the Debutante surrounded with Rue de Palm, Junior 
Miss Stakes winner A Wild Ride, and Patches, who had recently finished third to 
colts in the Balboa Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer jumped out to lead the field of nine around the first turn and 
into the backstretch. Del Mar newcomer Don Miller, riding her for the first 
time, took as much of a hold as he dared. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd worked her before, and if you try to throw her down too much she'll start 
getting out," Miller said. "Still, she ran an awful big race for going so 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer hit the halfway point in :44 3/5, with Rue de Palm second on 
the rail. A Wild Ride and Sorrento Stakes winner Cheval Volant were closest at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
The rest seemed to be struggling to keep up, especially the unbeaten 11-10 
favorite Ten K, who had been sending Gary Stevens bad signals as far back as 
the post parade. The gray filly was clearly on edge as she walked to the gate 
for her first try beyond six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"She kind of blew her top going to the gate," said Stevens, who gave up a mount 
in the Million to ride Ten K. "She was very nervous, not relaxed at all. Then, 
when dirt hit her in the face on the first turn, she went about six wide." 
</P>
<P>
While Ten K was struggling to get into the race, Russell Baze was sending Rue 
de Palm to the lead on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been trying to get out, so I got up inside the leader," said Baze, who 
won three races Sunday. "That's when she started looking straight ahead. After 
that I just managed not to mess it up." 
</P>
<P>
From there the dark bay daughter of Icecapade stretched her lead with every 
stride, leaving Dominant Dancer to hold off Cheval Volant by a head for second 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer returned $7 and $5, while Cheval Volant paid $5.20. If the 
results from Del Mar and Saratoga and Del Mar hold up, Lukas and Brant can 
boast the two best 2-year-old fillies in North America. Their Alydar filly 
Stella Madrid won the Spinaway Stakes at Saratoga on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"They're two different types," Lukas said. "But the great thing is, Peter is a 
breeder and I bought both these fillies for him at auction." 
</P>
<P>
And Rue de Palm, at $200,000 compared to $600,000 for Stella Madrid, might have 
been the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Leading rider Eddie Delahoussaye had a weekend he would like to forget. On 
Saturday, the meet's leading rider was handed a five-day suspension that is 
likely to cost him his first Del Mar title. Then on Sunday morning he embarked 
for Chicago, only to learn upon arrival that his Arlington Million mount, 
Frankly Perfect, had been scratched. Delahoussaye had given up the call on 
Dominant Dancer in the Debutante to ride in the Million. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a small cut on her right front hoof, Bayakoa emerged from her 
last-place finish in Saturday's Chula Vista Handicap in good condition, 
according to owner Frank Whitham. "About everything went wrong that could 
have," Whitham said Sunday. "But we haven't lost faith in her. We'll be looking 
at either the Ruffian Handicap (Sept. 24) or the Spinster (Oct. 14)) for her 
next start." . . . Trainer Ron Ellis has decided not to appeal a $1,000 fine 
imposed by Del Mar stewards after a 9-mm. pistol was discovered in the trunk of 
his car in the stable area last week. Racing Board investigators found the 
weapon in the course of a routine search after an Ellis-trained horse tested 
positive for the penicillin derivative procaine. "We had very little precedent 
on a penalty for the possession of a gun on the backstretch," said steward Mort 
Lipton. "But the fact that it was loaded made it more serious." Lipton 
described the case as an "isolated incident," but Ellis disagreed. "There are 
others who carry guns for protection, especially during the Hollywood Park 
meeting," said the trainer, currently third in the Del Mar standings. "That 
doesn't excuse what happened. I made a mistake, and fighting the ruling 
wouldn't do anybody any good. Besides, I don't want to be in a position to 
defend the possession of guns on the backstretch. I just hope the whole thing 
just goes away." . . . Southern California fans bet $887,440 on the Arlington 
Million and made victorious Steinlen ($10.40) their second choice. . . . In 
Extremis, impressive winner in his U.S. debut, and 1988 Arlington Million 
winner Mill Native might meet at Del Mar Thursday in a $60,000 overnight 
handicap. . . . The total handle of $10,343,146 was a record for a Del Mar 
card.

STEINLEN BIDES HIS TIME, SURGES TO VICTORY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a jockey who had ridden him only once before, and running because his 
trainers finally were convinced that he had the stamina to win, Steinlen scored 
a half-length victory over Lady in Silver in the ninth Arlington Million before 
a crowd of 30,129 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, a 6-year-old English-bred owned by Daniel Wildenstein, a Paris art 
dealer, ran a masterpiece. He came through on the rail under Jose Santos with 
three-sixteenths of a mile to go to overtake Frosty the Snowman and then held 
off Lady in Silver and Yankee Affair for a victory worth $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
French import Lady in Silver, ridden by Laffit Pincay and trying to become the 
first 3-year-old filly to win the Million, finished a half-length ahead of 
Yankee Affair in a race that was surprisingly devoid of much traffic trouble 
considering the 13-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Affair, with Pat Day aboard, was a head better than El Senor, the 
fourth-place finisher. The rest of the order of finish was Kefaah, Frosty the 
Snowman, Pleasant Variety, Great Communicator, Fijar Tango, Nasr el Arab, River 
Warden, Pay the Butler and Shady Heights. Frankly Perfect, who had suffered 
from a cough and a slight temperature since arriving here from California a 
week ago, was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having been the morning-line favorite, Steinlen was the third choice in 
the betting and paid $12.60, $7 and $4.60. Lady in Silver, who went off at 
23-1, paid $18.60 and $9, and Yankee Affair, at 13-1, returned $7.60. The $2 
perfecta on Steinlen and Lady in Silver paid $342.20 and a $2 bet for those who 
picked the first three finishers in order was worth $2,338.40. 
</P>
<P>
The grass at Arlington International Racecourse was listed as firm, but the 
rain earlier in the weekend still made the going slightly spongy. Steinlen's 
time of 2:03 3/5 for the 1 1/4 miles was the second slowest in the history of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
None of the first three finishers was originally eligible for the race, 
according to the list of invitees issued by an international board of 
handicappers 10 days ago, but they moved up from an also-eligible list when 
there were several defections. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen wasn't nominated to run in the Million, costing Wildenstein a $50,000 
penalty for the privilege of running and becoming the first supplementary 
nomination to win the stake. Yankee Affair was also a $50,000 supplementary. 
Horses originally nominated and kept eligible by their owners through a series 
of payments were able to run for a fee of $18,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Million was the first time Steinlen had ever been extended to 1 1/4 miles. 
All of his 14 victories in 32 previous starts had been at shorter distances. He 
ran second in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs last year and was being 
pointed for the same race this year, in November at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
But at Saratoga three weeks ago, Steinlen was rated off the pace in the 1 
1/8-mile Bernard Baruch Handicap and he rallied in the stretch for an 
impressive five-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more relaxed in that race and showed us he might be able to get the 
extra distance," assistant trainer Jeff Lukas said after the Million. Lukas won 
two races while saddling Steinlen at Saratoga for his father, Wayne, and Jeff 
also handled the assignment here while Wayne was winning Sunday's Del Mar 
Debutante with Rue de Palm. 
</P>
<P>
Santos rode Steinlen for the first time in the Baruch. Angel Cordero, who had 
ridden Steinlen in his previous race, was committed to ride Dancing Spree, and 
Santos was freed to ride Steinlen when his regular mount, Equalize, didn't run 
in the Baruch. 
</P>
<P>
Equalize, second in last year's Million, was one of the horses from the invited 
list who didn't run Sunday, enabling Steinlen to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised that we weren't invited originally," Jeff Lukas said. "I 
think a lot of people were surprised, because this horse has had excellent form 
for the last two years. I think the consensus was that he should have been 
included, and his performance emphasized that today." 
</P>
<P>
There was not an abundance of early speed in the Million. Steinlen broke on 
top, but Santos got him to relax and after about 40 yards Jorge Velasquez 
reluctantly went to the front with Frosty the Snowman, the second betting 
choice behind the entry of Nasr el Arab and River Warden, who went off at 3- 1. 
</P>
<P>
Down the backstretch, setting slow fractions, Frosty the Snowman continued to 
lead by about three lengths, with Great Communicator, Steinlen and Lady in 
Silver staying within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
On the far turn, Frosty the Snowman continued to lead, and then he and Lady in 
Silver twice exchanged positions, with the filly gaining a fleeting lead at the 
top of the stretch. All the while, Santos kept Steinlen on the fence, content 
with his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew No. 10 (Frosty the Snowman) gets out, that he tires," Santos said. "I 
was pretty sure I'd be able to get inside or outside of him when I wanted to. 
At the half-mile pole, I had said to myself that I wouldn't move, because I was 
in the short part of the track where I could win the race." 
</P>
<P>
Frosty the Snowman did move off the fence as Steinlen moved through, and the 
head-on tape of the stretch run showed that the winner had more room to 
accelerate than it appeared from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit my horse twice left-handed and he opened up about a three-quarter-length 
lead," Santos said.

<P>
Velasquez thought he would be sitting slightly off Steinlen's pace in the early 
going, instead of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to go wire to wire on this kind of surface," Velasquez said. "It was 
soft. But I think my horse could have led all the way if he just relaxed, but 
he didn't. He wouldn't come to me the way horses do when they get the lead and 
then relax. He fought me, and used himself up." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, riding Lady in Silver for the first time, felt good through the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"She just flew in the stretch," he said. "I thought she would win. She never 
quit and just kept on running." 
</P>
<P>
Lady in Silver earned $200,000 for second and Yankee Affair, a $10,000 purchase 
ridden by Pat Day, earned $110,000. Day had won a couple of stakes with Yankee 
Affair in New Jersey earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Affair appeared to hang in the final yards, although Day didn't think 
so. "We were going the fastest of all at the end, but we just ran out of 
ground," Day said. "We got floated wide at the top of the stretch, and that 
cost us some ground." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela rode Nasr el Arab, winner of the Strub and the San Juan 
Capistrano at Santa Anita this year. Nasr el Arab made his first start since a 
fifth-place finish in the Hollywood Gold Cup nine weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely had trouble," Valenzuela said. "I checked (restrained) him 
(because of traffic) the first time past the stands and then we had to check 
again on the last turn." 
</P>
<P>
Wildenstein sent Steinlen to the Lukas barn in December of 1987. The son of 
Habitat and Southern Seas, a Jim French mare, seldom runs a dull race. Last 
year, he had six wins, four seconds and a third in 13 starts and this year he 
has five wins, four seconds and a third in nine tries, with Sunday's 
performance increasing his earnings to $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the race, Jeff Lukas was confident that Steinlen would be among the 
first three. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse is a tryer," Lukas said. "When he gets hooked, he seldom gets beat. 
Once there was room for him to get through, I knew he would get by Frosty the 
Snowman."

CHILE PROTESTS BRAZIL'S FIREWORKS AFTER 1-0 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brazil apparently became the first team to qualify for soccer's 1990 World Cup, 
but its 1-0 victory over Chile on Sunday was thrown into doubt when fireworks 
thrown by a fan appeared to knock down the Chilean goalkeeper with 22 minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Rojas was carried off the field on a stretcher and his teammates walked 
off the field and did not return. Referee Juan Carlos Loustau of Argentina 
waited 20 minutes and then called the match after consulting with Agustin 
Dominguez of Spain and Eduardo Rocca Couture of Uruguay, members of the 1990 
World Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Careca scored for Brazil four minutes into the second half before 
160,000 fans in Maracana Stadium at Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
"Chile has filed a protest asking FIFA to annul the game and to apply sanctions 
against Brazil and Maracana Stadium," said Sergio Stoppel, president of the 
Chilean Soccer Federation. "It was physically impossible for us to compete." 
</P>
<P>
In other games, Trinidad and Tobago beat Guatemala, 2-1; Bolivia upset Uruguay, 
2-1, and Colombia and Ecuador tied, 0-0. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas slumped to the field next to the fireworks rocket, which billowed green 
smoke. He was taken off on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Stoppel said the rocket opened a 1 1/4-inch cut that required five stitches. 
However, Eurico Miranda of the Brazil Soccer Federation said the apparent 
bleeding was faked. 
</P>
<P>
"The rocket did not hit the player," Miranda said. "The Chileans threw 
Mercurochrome on his face and said he cut himself." 
</P>
<P>
Added Brazilian Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni: "The rocket went up, fell behind 
Rojas and he threw himself on the ground. Then Chile made a scene." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil finished South America Group Three with a 3-0-1 record and six points. 
Chile finished 2-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
At Port of Spain, Trinidad, Kerry Jameson scored for Trinidad and Tabago with 
two minutes left. It was his goal that beat Guatemala two weeks ago at 
Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad (3-1-3) has nine points with one match left, a Nov. 19 home game 
against the United States. The U.S. (2-1-1) has five points. Costa Rica (5-2-1) 
has completed play with 11 points. The top two teams in the North and Central 
American and Caribbean region qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala (1-4) lost its fourth straight. Guatemala took the lead on Julio 
Rodas's goal in the sixth minute but Philbert Jones tied it four minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
At La Paz, Bolivia, Alfonso Dominguez gave Uruguay the lead with seven minutes 
left in the first half but Alvaro Pena tied it a minute into the second half 
and Ruben Sosa scored two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia (2-0) beat Peru, 2-1, at home on Aug. 20 and plays Peru next Sunday at 
Lima. Bolivia lost to Uruguay, 3-0, in their last meeting, a first round match 
of the America Cup last July 4. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay (1-1) beat Peru, 2-0, last Sunday. Uruguay plays host to Bolivia Sept. 
17 and Peru Sept. 24 in the final Group One match. 
</P>
<P>
At Guayaquil, Ecuador, Colombia moved into first place with a 1-1-1 record. 
Paraguay (1-0) is second and Ecuador (0-1) is third.

Nashwan will pass up a chance to become the first colt to win the English 
Triple Crown of horse racing since Nijinsky in 1970 by skipping the St. Leger 
in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old Nashwan, unbeaten in six races, won the 2,000 Guineas and the 
English Derby this spring to claim the first two legs of the Triple Crown. The 
horse also won the King George VI race in late July.

JACK SMITH: WHEN BIG-CITY NAMES HIT CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an alien from Neptune's moon Triton were visiting in New York City, and 
someone happened to ask him "Where are you from?" as someone inevitably would, 
he would probably say he was from Neptune, rather than Triton. 
</P>
<P>
He would assume that everyone had heard of Neptune, whereas Triton might not be 
as well-known, and he would probably have to explain that it was just a little 
moon in orbit around Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
This is a device most of us use when we're traveling, not so much to pretend 
that we are from a place of importance, but to avoid having to explain the 
exact location of our home, in relation to someplace larger. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if you happen to be from Sausalito, and you're talking to a stranger in a 
bar in Paris, there's no use saying you're from Sausalito, and having to 
explain where that is; best just to say you're from San Francisco, to avoid 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
While traveling I have heard many variations on this dodge. Someone will say 
"Where you folks from?" And the person asked will say, "Los Angeles." And the 
stranger will say, "Oh? Where in Los Angeles?" And the visitor is obliged to 
say, "Well, actually, we live in Covina. That's a suburb of Los Angeles." 
Whereupon his interrogator puts him down as an impostor. 
</P>
<P>
How this innocent subterfuge can be carried to ultimately comic and 
embarrassing lengths is shown in a letter from Robert Taylor of Tustin (in the 
Anaheim area). 
</P>
<P>
Taylor recalls that in 1956 he was flying from New York to Los Angeles and he 
asked the man sitting next to him, in the lounge, whether he was going home or 
was traveling on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Home," the man answered, and volunteered that he lived "in the L.A. area." 
</P>
<P>
"So do I," Taylor said. "In San Gabriel. Where do you live?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well," the man said, "I really live in Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor allowed that he was familiar with Bakersfield, having stopped there many 
times on trips to Fresno, Madera, Yosemite or Sequoia National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the man said, he didn't actually live in Bakersfield. "I really stay in 
Buttonwillow, where my son has a place." 
</P>
<P>
Now Buttonwillow, while home to many folks, is not an internationally known 
place name. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor was familiar with it: "A little bitty place out of Bakersfield, 
maybe 20 miles west on the old road to San Luis." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," the man said, "I really work in the oil fields in Weed Patch. 
That's about halfway to Arvin from Highway 99. No one has ever heard of Weed 
Patch so I tell them I'm from the L.A. area." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he was also familiar with Weed Patch. His brother had helped bring 
in the first oil well there. Evidently, his traveling companion had exhausted 
his lines of retreat. He stayed with Weed Patch. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived for some years in Bakersfield, I have always known where Weed 
Patch was, and if I were traveling in London or Cairo or Athens and some 
American told me he was from Weed Patch, I'd say, "Weed Patch, hey -- I know it 
well. Up there just southeast of Bakersfield, isn't it ?" The "up there" would 
refer, of course, to its relationship to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Weed Patch is not the absolutely most rustic name in the Bakersfield 
area. The man could have been from Pumpkin Center. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife and I were first married we lived in Oildale, north of the Kern 
River from Bakersfield. Now Oildale is not a name that is recognized throughout 
the world as a population and cultural center. So when we traveled, which was 
rarely, and never any farther than San Francisco, we always said we were from 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud to say that, out of a sense of modesty or honesty or loyalty to 
Bakersfield, we never said we were from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There is one exception to this harmless attempt to upgrade one's place of 
residence. I have never met anyone from Orange County who pretended to live in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Why should they? Anaheim is so well-known throughout the civilized world as the 
home of Disneyland and the Rams and the Angels, that to say, "I'm from 
Anaheim," is enough to identify one's place of origin, whether one is from 
Tustin, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Yorba Linda or El Toro.

ON YOUR OWN: DOES HEIGHT MATTER IN A RELATIONSHIP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Size, as well as beauty, seems to be in the eyes of the beholder. I printed a 
letter from a man who was unhappy that his height (5 feet, 4 inches) was a 
turnoff to many women, and he despaired about ever meeting anyone who could 
love him as he is. I asked my women readers to let me know if they would be 
disinterested in a man shorter than themselves. Some responded that it would be 
a problem; others said it would not, and several focused on other aspects of 
the issue. One woman responded: 
</P>
<P>
"I would be attracted to someone shorter than me, but, unfortunately, it's not 
that simple. Personality is a big part of it. Most short men that I have met 
seem to have a macho complex because of their height. They are usually trying 
to show off or prove how tough they are in one way or another. One man carries 
a lot of money; one uses weightlifting. Another lets everyone know what a great 
marksman he is. Granted that men of average height or taller may have the same 
hang-ups, but it usually seems they have less to prove." 
</P>
<P>
The opposite view of short men's personalities is expressed in this letter from 
a Massachusetts woman: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Reverence' 
</P>
<P>
"I have great reverence for these guys who are my height. I am 5 feet, 3 inches 
tall, but I have dated men who are shorter than me as well. It is my opinion 
that a 'short man' is more compatible. I don't know why, but I have found that 
shorter men are more kind and gentle than hulking monsters. Maybe I am in the 
minority, but I have been able to relate quite well with short men who feel 
that they are in the same minority as me. I have found shorter men to be more 
handsome, more socially conscious, more virile, more physically active, more 
intelligent and with greater endurance than some of the so-called Big Boys of 
male fame. I hope this letter gives your insecure reader a lift." 
</P>
<P>
A California reader wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I have a boyfriend who is shorter than I am, and it does bother me. I am 6 
feet tall, divorced and have three children. It's really hard to find a nice 
tall man, so I stay with the man I have because he is a very loving, caring and 
devoted person and that's what I want in a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me because he looks like my younger brother instead of my mate, but 
we do have good times when I forget about his height." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an Indiana woman sends a message that can cheer both despairing short 
men and uncomfortable taller women. She writes: 
</P>
<P>
"I have been married for 19 years. My husband is 5 feet, 4 inches tall, but he 
is the tallest man I know. I wish people could be judged from the neck up. I 
never really think of him as being short. He's fantastic, great and my hero -- 
yes! But short -- no." 
</P>
<P>
Most people are drawn to certain physical types more than others. Some people 
have a much wider range of types that they find appealing than others. 
Fortunately, there is probably no type that no one is drawn to. We can't force 
ourselves to be attracted to someone, but, sometimes, if we become involved 
with a person who would not normally be our type but who is in many ways right 
for us, the attraction can grow. I know people who have passionately said to 
others, "You didn't used to be my type." 
</P>
<P>
On another subject, several readers responded to my answer to a woman who felt 
awkward and hesitant about calling a man she had met at a professional meeting. 
I wrote that while this is sometimes difficult for women to do because they 
generally are not used to taking the risk of being the one to call and face the 
possibility of rejection, she really had nothing to lose. If it's too risky to 
call him for a date, I counseled, call him just to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Most women reported that when they called, the men were glad to hear from them; 
a few said the men were put off by their call, and several said they had 
married or become romantically involved with the men they took the initiative 
to call. And there was this letter from a California man: 
</P>
<P>
"I met a woman in 1981 at a pub, and we exchanged phone numbers. I said I would 
call her, and we would go out and play darts. Well, I didn't call her. There 
was no reason -- I just didn't get around to it. After about two weeks she 
called me and said, 'I thought we were going to play darts.' We went out, and 
we continued to see each other. We were romantically involved for more than a 
year. We both realized that we were not interested in each other as marriage 
partners, but we have remained dear friends ever since. Although we live in 
different cities, we talk on the telephone every week, and we are planning a 
trip together. We have a great friendship, and it is all because she called me. 
So I say to all those women, go ahead and call the man if you want to. I am 
thankful she did."

Good Intentions by Joy Fielding (Doubleday: $18.95; 304 pages) 
</P>
<P>
This is a cartoon with cartoon characters and a cartoon plot, but fortunately 
or unfortunately, that doesn't mean these situations aren't real. "Good 
Intentions" is a story of two women, a dumped wife and her female divorce 
lawyer, belabored, besieged and beleaguered by a set of men who, except for one 
"nice guy" (too good to be true, by the way, a writer, with integrity), are all 
louts, morons, and churlish beasts. 
</P>
<P>
Let me pause to remind all of us that from time to time, all our lives fade 
from three-dimensional dignity into the primary colors of the funny papers. 
Even as I write, there's a woman in town trying to steal jobs from good women, 
and you can see it, because she acts like Ann Blythe in "All About Eve." 
There's a man in a local medical school, currently beating his wife, because 
she knows the answers and he doesn't. People act like cartoons all the time, 
and usually it's the artists' task to soften these edges, make motivations more 
subtle, lend a little dignity to all concerned, so that their characters don't 
end up looking like Blondie or Dagwood and/or the Dragon Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Joy Fielding doesn't bother with any of that. She sets up her dumped wife, a 
good woman named Lynn, who's been left with no warning by a husband who she 
thought loved her, but who, in fact, has run off with a married woman, wife of 
Marc (writer with integrity, see above.) Lynn is heartbroken, disoriented, 
struggling to raise her 7-year-old son. Lynn is a good person: You can tell 
because (a) she won't go to bed with Marc, even though she wants to, and (b) 
she likes to take long walks on the beach. Did you ever, in fiction, meet a 
villain who liked to take long walks on the beach? No way! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handsomest Man in Town 
</P>
<P>
The counter-couple here to Lynn and her no-count husband, and her decent 
would-be lover, is Renee, Lynn's very successful divorce lawyer, who is married 
to Philip, the handsomest man in town, and -- the reader can see at once -- a 
low-down, hog-bellied, two-timing bum. Renee is living in a comic-strip dream 
world, reiterating to herself, and anyone who will listen, what a lucky person 
she is to have snagged Philip. Except that Renee keeps compulsively eating 
candy bars. Her step-daughter, Debbie, a fiend from Hell, treats her like a 
lizard. And Philip keeps helpfully telling Renee that she looks awful. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the half of it, of course. When Renee has a triumph in court and 
wants to talk about it, Philip accuses her of showing off. When Renee shows 
signs of winning an argument, Philip accuses her of aggression and 
competitiveness. The only times Philip ever wants to make love are when they're 
on their way to a party at Renee's law firm, or when Renee has an important 
meeting. And, of course, when Renee's sister comes to visit, you know pretty 
much what's going to happen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faults Are Obvious 
</P>
<P>
I thought a lot about this book. Its faults are obvious. Philip is a cartoon. 
But I know cartoons like that, and they're not always men. (That job-stealing 
lady, that medical-school brute, exist in life right now.) Maybe the job of the 
novelist is to catch human beings in the act, as they switch from human-being 
behavior over to funny paper behavior; to catch the wife before she begins 
gobbling those candy bars or the sociopath stepdaughter before she begins 
laying about her with an emotional sledgehammer. In one of the most interesting 
lines in the book, Renee's stepdaughter, who finally clues her into what's 
going on, says, "'Why don't you just tell him to go to hell. . . . Why don't 
you tell me to go to hell?"' 
</P>
<P>
There's a human being behind that particular cartoon, and it would be nice to 
see more of that character and of all the rest. Meanwhile, "Good Intentions" is 
for women whose husbands only want sex before a party with their wives' 
friends. This is funny-paper country, but the rough drawings here are real.

A VERSION OF SARAH VAUGHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday was a big day for Sarah Vaughan. Mayor Tom Bradley presented her with a 
proclamation citing the date as "Sarah Vaughan Day" in Los Angeles, and she 
opened a two-day stint with Marty Paich and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the 
Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The honor was well-deserved. Vaughan has been a major jazz performer for most 
of her 45 years in the business. But her reputation was not made in summer pops 
performances with symphony orchestras, and the 11,878 listeners at Friday's 
program heard only a mild, pastel version of Vaughan's once bold and colorful 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly confessing to nervousness, she brought little sense of focus or 
continuity to her set -- a problem compounded by programming that inevitably 
followed a slow number with a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
There were times, however, when the Vaughan artistry flashed with its old 
glory: on "Sweet Georgia Brown" she conjured up a hard-rocking groove; "From 
This Moment On" swung even harder; "In a Mellow Tone" was just mellow enough; 
"So Many Stars," with its wide-ranging melody, was a perfect vehicle for her 
still-gorgeous sound. 
</P>
<P>
The finest moments came, for the most part, during the up-tempo songs, in part 
because Vaughan's rhythmic energy was in fine fettle, perhaps even better than 
in her earliest recordings. But the soaring, lyric soprano tones of her youth 
-- among the most emblematic aspects of her style -- rarely rose above 
contralto range, at best. 
</P>
<P>
Occasional diamond-bright sparks of brilliance, usually occurring when she was 
accompanied only by her trio of pianist George Gaffney, bassist Andy Simpkins 
and drummer Cal Jones, led one to wish for a Vaughan performance uncluttered by 
the busy distractions of such a grand setting. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Ramsey Lewis opened the evening with a surprisingly lethargic 
collection of material. The crisp rhythms usually associated with his playing 
made only fleeting appearances. His best moments, in fact, came during several 
dreamily romantic pieces in which arranger/conductor James Mack took full 
advantage of the Philharmonic's lush-sounding strings. Guitarist Henry Johnson 
provided some much-needed vigor, especially during a brisk solo on "Since I 
Fell for You."

Organizers of Save Venice Inc., a U.S.-based group raising money for preserving 
art treasures of the Italian city, say they have raised more than $450,000 to 
finance restoration of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and of lunettes, 
paintings and marbles in three other nearby churches. The money was raised at a 
$1,500-a-person gala last week that ended a four-day festival of private 
parties, concerts and art tours in Venice and nearby Vicenza. Those attending 
the gala included Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah, and Paloma Picasso, 
daughter of the late painter Pablo Picasso. SHAUNA SNOW

A judge in Dublin, Ireland has waived a marijuana conviction for U2 member Adam 
Clayton, in exchange for the rock bassist's agreement to pay $34,500 to 
charity. Justice Desmond Windle discharged Clayton, 29, on Friday. Clayton was 
arrested Aug. 6 in the parking lot of a pub near his home. He admitted to 
possession of marijuana, and prosecutors later dropped a charge that he planned 
to supply the drug to others. Clayton, who was accompanied to the hearing by U2 
manager Paul McGuinness and drummer Larry Mullen, refused to speak to reporters 
outside the court. The fine will go to the Dublin Women's Aid and Refugee 
Center. SHAUNA SNOW

The Jewish Defense League says it will monitor a taping of the new Jackie Mason 
sitcom to make sure the comedian doesn't promote "negative stereotyping of 
Jews." The JDL said its members had obtained numerous tickets for an upcoming 
taping of "Chicken Soup," which debuts on ABC Sept. 12. "We are sick and tired 
of Jewish American Princess stereotypes being used to demean Jewish women and 
we are just as sick of Jewish nebishes being portrayed on television," the JDL 
said in a statement. Replied Bernie Orenstein, an executive producer of 
"Chicken Soup": "We welcome everyone to come and see the show because we're 
totally confident the show is a truthful, funny comedy. We can't imagine any 
Jewish or Gentile people being offended by it." "Chicken Soup" stars former 
rabbi Mason as Jackie Fisher, a retired pajama salesman sharing an apartment 
with his mother, who doesn't approve of his dating a non-Jewish woman. SHAUNA

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'THE JESTERS' CONCLUDES UCLA FILM SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Subtitles are inadequate to convey the political and historical complexities of 
Jose Alvaro Morais' stunningly ambitious but virtually impenetrable "The 
Jester," the concluding film in "The Cutting Edge II" series that screens 
Tuesday at 8 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz Theater. Morais' elegant 
10-years-in-the-making film intercuts the rehearsal of a 19th-Century play on 
the establishment of the Portuguese state in 1125 with its producer's attempt 
to finance its production with the sale of a cache of weapons. It is 1978, a 
time of disillusionment in the wake of the loss of empire in Africa and the 
1974 defeat of political radicals. (213) 206-8013, 206-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
The series of Akira Kurosawa's earliest films continues at the Little Tokyo 
Cinema 2 this Friday with the week-long engagement of "The Most Beautiful" 
(1944) and "One Wonderful Sunday" (1947). Teaming one of Kurosawa's four 
wartime pictures with his first postwar film creates an ironic impact, for "The 
Most Beautiful" pays tribute to the extreme sacrifices that were made by 
ordinary people on the home front, whereas the second concerns the struggle of 
the same kind of people merely to survive in a corrupt and disillusioned 
postwar era. It was a time when it seemed, in the words of its beleaguered 
hero, that "decent people don't have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
"The Most Beautiful" is one of the least embarrassing World War II pictures 
made by anyone on either side of the conflict. Not only does Kurosawa avoid 
jingoism and racism but he also never once endorses Japan's aggression. Instead 
he reveals the utterly selfless dedication of a group of young women, clearly 
of unsophisticated rural backgrounds, who are working at a lens factory on the 
outskirts of Tokyo. As the film opens, the factory director (Takashi Shimura, 
destined to be a Kurosawa regular) announces that the men must double their 
production whereas the women are to increase their output by half, since lenses 
are crucial in so much weaponry. Watanabe (Yoko Yaguchi), a group leader, 
persuades the director that the women can do two-thirds, rather than merely 
half, of the men's quota. 
</P>
<P>
The determination and the solidarity with which these young people proceed on 
their grueling task, suffering frostbite even in grinding the lenses, is 
genuinely touching. Seen today, "The Most Beautiful" seems a remarkably honest 
depiction of the toll exacted on the Japanese people by a clearly worsening 
war. The pretty and talented Yaguchi made only one more film before wedding her 
director, to whom she was married 40 years before her death in 1985 during the 
production of "Ran." 
</P>
<P>
"One Wonderful Sunday" is the first Kurosawa masterpiece and is also the first 
of several Kurosawa films done in a style virtually identical to that of 
Vittorio De Sica in his Neo-Realist period. (It has aptly been called his 
"Miracle in Milan.") Working with writer Keinosuke Uegusa, Kurosawa has created 
a film of timeless poetic impact, concentrating on an engaged young couple, 
Yuzo (Isao Numasaki) and Masako (Chieko Nakakita), who are so impoverished that 
they are able to meet only on Sundays, when Masako arrives in Tokyo by train. 
As intimate a film as "One Wonderful Sunday" is, it has the epic scope and 
visual bravura that was to become typical of Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the couple's single day we get a very clear view of what life 
in postwar Tokyo was like, overridden with black marketeers and signs (some 
misspelled) in English to attract the business of the forces of Occupation. At 
every turn -- a trip to the zoo being an exception -- the couple finds 
themselves frustrated by being so very nearly broke; propriety, we discover in 
one long and poignant scene, forbids them the pleasure of premarital sex. In 
many ways "One Wonderful Sunday" is very venturesome, especially in its use of 
music, which ranges from a couple of tangos to a banjo rendition of "My Blue 
Heaven" and Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony." At a crucial point, Masako 
addresses the audience, daring to involve us in making the couple's dreams come 
true. The series concludes with the two-part "Sanshiro Sugata" (1942-44), which 
opens Sept. 15. Information: (213) 687-7077.

NICKELODEON'S NEW LINEUP FOR PRESCHOOLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pinwheel," Nickelodeon cable's potpourri of puppetry, live action, animation 
and short films for preschoolers, has been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Its successor, to be unveiled today at 11:30 a.m. is "Eureeka's Castle," a 
potpourri of puppetry, live action, animation and short films for preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's different? 
</P>
<P>
This is the all new, improved, deluxe model. 
</P>
<P>
Some comparisons to "Sesame Street" are unavoidable, although the focus here is 
not the ABCs. The segments are varied and quick, to accommodate the shorter 
attention spans of young children, and the inhabitants of the Castle are 
Muppet-like puppets. 
</P>
<P>
There are Eureeka, a little girl wizard, a whiny bat, assorted mice, a helpful 
handyman, the grungy Moat Twins, who look and sound like close relatives of 
Oscar the Grouch, and a baby dragon named Magellan. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is to the show what Big Bird is to "Sesame Street." He's the 
5-year-old who needs reassurance and wonders about the why of things. 
</P>
<P>
The "message" puppet interplay is pleasant and unexceptional. It is used to 
impart gentle messages of sharing, fears and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
But the first show is a veritable cornucopia of little pleasures for any age. 
</P>
<P>
The offerings include an animated version of William Steig's curious tale, "The 
Amazing Bone"; a live-action film about a comic beetle; superb clay animation 
and a delightful guest spot with folk-singer Tom Chapin (he's also the host of 
"National Geographic Explorer") singing from his new children's album. 
</P>
<P>
It's a toss-up as to who will get the most out of this show: adults or their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Following "Eureeka's Castle" is "Fred Penner's Place," the second show in 
Nickelodeon's new weekday line-up, airing at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This half-hour is a Canadian import -- it's been running there for five 
seasons. Like Sharon, Lois and Bram -- the trio from Nickelodeon's "The 
Elephant Show" -- Penner is one of a select few top-selling Canadian children's 
recording artists who have made significant in-roads on the market here. 
</P>
<P>
Penner's "Place" is a secret, woodsy hideaway reachable only through a hollow 
log. The bearded, lanky Penner affably sings songs, tells stories, offers a 
word for the day -- courtesy of Word Bird (a puppet) -- and entertains whatever 
visitor might pop in. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, two comic jugglers billed as "Circus Shmirkus" learn to work 
together and Penner talks about cooperation and sings about friendship. 
</P>
<P>
It's an amiable preschooler offering, loose and appealing, like a folksy 
"Mister Rogers."

BODYBUILDERS OF YESTERDAY SALUTE FIRST SITE OF FAMED MUSCLE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Muscle men of yore joined younger acrobats Sunday on the sands of Santa Monica 
to dedicate a plaque marking the original site of Muscle Beach, hailed by some 
as the birthplace of today's physical fitness fanaticism. Bodybuilders started 
working out on a platform just south of the Santa Monica Pier in the mid-1940s, 
but the site was closed 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While Venice now lays claim to the title of Muscle Beach, a group of the 
ever-faithful -- including exercise guru Jack LaLanne and Steve (Hercules) 
Reeves -- fought to have the Santa Monica site remembered. The Muscle Beach 
Alumni Assn. sought and obtained approval for the 2-by-3-foot sign erected 
Sunday. Among those on hand were LaLanne, flexing his muscles, and George 
Sunby, with microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"Muscle Beach was like a Roman holiday," said George Eiferman, a former Mr. 
America who was one of a group of muscle men who joined Mae West in a Las Vegas 
review in the 1950s. "We'll never have that again."

RACING KING'S DEATH UNSOLVED; 
</P>
<P>
STACK OF CLUES LEADS NOWHERE IN THE MICKEY THOMPSON SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are more than 1,100 clues, but no answers. 
</P>
<P>
There are files so thick with notes that stacked they would reach the ceiling 
of detective headquarters, but no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
There was even a plea for assistance on an episode of NBC's "Unsolved 
Mysteries" that aired in February and again in June. 
</P>
<P>
But today, investigators are still no closer to solving the mystery surrounding 
the murder of racing pioneer Mickey Thompson and his wife, Trudy, than the day 
a year and a half ago that the couple were gunned down in the driveway of their 
Bradbury estate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Clues 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not there," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Investigator Mike 
Griggs, who has worked full time on the case since the Thompsons were slain on 
March 16, 1988. "It's almost gotten down to the point where we need a phone 
call, for somebody to come forth . . . and that's almost like winning the 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
Already, hundreds of callers from around the country have claimed to recognize 
the two men pictured in composite sketches of the gunmen neighbors saw fleeing 
on bicycles shortly after the 6 a.m. murders and a sketch of another man 
believed linked to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Psychics have come forth to share visions of who called for the murder of the 
59-year-old millionaire known as the "Speed King" and his 42-year-old business 
partner and wife. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends have pointed fingers at a flashy, high-rolling motocross 
promoter who lost a bitter lawsuit to Thompson and, the last police heard, is 
living in self-imposed exile on a 57-foot yacht somewhere in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 322 murders investigated by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
last year, this remains among the 116 that the department's homicide detectives 
have not been able to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, in a homicide, if the case remains unsolved after a week, your 
chances really start to drop," said Griggs, a 25-year law enforcement veteran. 
"As time passes, the flow of information just starts to cease. There's nothing 
magical you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that those who knew the Thompsons have lost any faith that 
their assailants will one day be caught. 
</P>
<P>
You can't just gun down two of the nicest people in the world and get away with 
it, they say of the couple who ferried guests in chartered planes to their 
lavish Las Vegas wedding in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
You can't just snuff out the can-opener mechanic who brought off-road racing 
from the desert to the stadium, the first American to drive a car faster than 
400 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
You can't blow away the woman who adored her husband, the one who always looked 
as if she had just stepped out of a fashion magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I have a breath in me, I'm not going to back off," said Mickey 
Thompson's sister, Collene Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spurred Initiative Drive 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has tried to channel her frustrations into an initiative drive 
launched last March, on the anniversary of the murders, aimed at quickening 
criminal trials and stiffening penalties for violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Thompson, Mickey's 39-year-old son, has continued to pursue his racing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
And in Bradbury, the wealthy San Gabriel Valley community that has three miles 
of public streets and 10 miles of gated private roads, the reminders of the 
city's only murders still linger. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other week, City Manager Dolly Vollaire was driving to work when she 
recognized the Thompsons' old trash can -- with "MT" still stenciled on it -- 
on the street, waiting to be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
"I called up the disposal company and asked them to paint over that," said 
Vollaire. "It just brought everything back." 
</P>
<P>
It brought back the morning that Thompson was confronted in front of his 13-car 
garage as he and his wife were leaving for work. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant, who apparently had been lurking in the bushes, has been 
described by neighbors as black, 20 to 30, of medium height and weight and 
wearing a dark outfit that may have been a sweat suit. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a muscular man who believed in the old-fashioned notion that it is a 
husband's duty to protect his wife, took the shots as he cried, "Just don't 
hurt my baby. Don't hurt my baby." 
</P>
<P>
But another gunman, whom witnesses also have described as a 20- to 30-year-old 
black man, was already heading toward Trudy Thompson, who was warming up the 
couple's van. 
</P>
<P>
"You think of something like that happening in another type of area, but not in 
Bradbury," said Lance Johnson, a real estate agent who donated his commission 
from the sale of the Thompsons' home last November to the family's $250,000 
reward fund. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled on 10-speed bikes, a method of escape not so absurd 
considering the narrow road with speed bumps downhill from the house, police 
say. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, described as white, was later seen in nearby Irwindale abandoning 
a bicycle similar to the ones used by the trigger men before hitching a ride on 
a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
If there was any doubt that this was a professional, contract-style hit, it was 
erased when investigators discovered that Trudy Thompson was wearing $70,000 
worth of jewelry, none of it touched, and that the couple were carrying about 
$4,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Mickey was the kind of guy who would always say, 'Don't stop and think. Just 
keep it in gear. Stand on the gas,' " said Bill Marcel, who took over as 
president of Thompson's Anaheim-based motor sports promotion firm after the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for the focus to fall on one name, a name that has 
continued to surface in conversations and court documents -- that of Thompson's 
44-year-old archrival and one-time business partner, Michael Frank Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed by sheriff's investigators last December, a 
neighbor recalled that Thompson had once said that Goodwin "was going to kill 
him." A woman reportedly remembered Trudy Thompson confiding that if anything 
happened to her or her husband, "Michael Goodwin would be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the killings, Collene Campbell recalled, her brother told her, 
"I'm afraid Michael Goodwin is going to hurt my baby." 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'Oh, Mick. You don't really believe this,' " Campbell said. "He 
said, 'Collene, I'm telling you, the man is capable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have spoken to Goodwin, who declared bankruptcy after a long and 
messy legal battle with Thompson over their failed attempt to promote motor 
sports races. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodwin has told officers that he was not involved in the murders and has 
nothing more to say. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the shootings, Goodwin and his wife, Diane, left town, 
reportedly heading toward the Caribbean. Police believe they are still living 
on a boat dubbed "Believe." 
</P>
<P>
"He absolutely and utterly denies it," said Goodwin's attorney, Allan H. 
Stokke, adding that he is in contact with Goodwin but will not reveal his 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could be accomplished if he were to talk with police is 
they would interrogate him about every little detail and try to find something 
wrong," Stokke said. In 1986, shortly after he was ordered by a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge to pay Thompson a $500,000 judgment for breach of contract 
in their business partnership, Goodwin told The Times: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a people person. All I care about is results. I don't care if people 
like me or how I get the results. If somebody has a contract with me and they 
don't perform, I'll take their legs off if I have to get them to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Griggs believes that sooner or later something will have to break, 
someone will have to talk. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the phone on his desk in the Hall of Justice rings with possible 
leads about the case less often. The tips that once flowed in from across the 
country have now trickled to about three or four a week. "I could get the big 
phone call right now," he said. "Or I could go another two years and get 
nothing."

ARE WE ALONE?; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING THE SEARCH FOR OTHER PLANETARY SYSTEMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have succeeded in recent years in unraveling some of the great 
mysteries of the universe, but some where out there, trillions of miles away, 
the grandest trophy of all awaits discovery. 
</P>
<P>
That trophy is a simple answer to the most haunting question of all: Are we 
alone? 
</P>
<P>
The quest for an answer has proved nearly as frustrating as it is important, 
because the distance between stars is so vast that it has been impossible to 
prove whether other stars even have planets and thus could support life. But 
today, scientists see themselves on the brink of discovering whether planetary 
systems are rare or common throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology is now at hand to search for planetary systems," said David 
Black, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. "We are 
witnessing the birth of a new discipline." 
</P>
<P>
That technology will include a wide range of orbiting telescopes that will have 
to function on a level of perfection almost beyond imagination. It will take 
years, and possibly decades, to design, build and put the telescopes in orbit, 
but scientists believe they are ready to begin answering a question that has 
bedeviled humans since the dawn of history. 
</P>
<P>
The search is hampered by the fact that there is only one known planetary 
system throughout the entire universe. 
</P>
<P>
"We only have one we can study, and that is our own," Peter Goldreich of 
Caltech told a planetary seminar at UC Berkeley marking the 100th birthday of 
the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
But because the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, there is 
little evidence remaining that has not been severely altered by the passage of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"All the clues we have are very old," Goldreich said. 
</P>
<P>
What happened all those many years ago to cause nine planets to form around a 
young, undistinguished star? 
</P>
<P>
While scientists disagree on the details, there is a consensus on how it all 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that in its prenatal stage the sun was a giant cloud of gas and 
dust, called a "solar nebula," drifting through the galaxy. Like clouds in the 
Earth's atmosphere, some areas were more dense than others, and they gradually 
accumulated enough material to create weak gravitational fields. 
</P>
<P>
As the denser pockets grew in mass they swirled around each other and 
ultimately merged, causing the core of the cloud to grow ever more compact. 
</P>
<P>
In time, the inner core of the cloud collapsed from the increasingly strong 
gravitational field, causing an implosion that set off a nuclear chain 
reaction. It was a spectacular -- but not unusual -- event, repeated billions 
of times throughout the Milky Way galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
Another star had been born, a star destined to become a modest, average 
performer, like trillions and trillions of others. 
</P>
<P>
After its birth, the sun remained cloaked in a cloud of gas and dust for 
awhile. But the new star generated powerful forces, including an immense 
magnetic field and fierce solar winds that soon began sweeping the cloud away 
from the sun's poles and into a flat disk that swirled around its equator. The 
dust and gas then coalesced into planets. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, space-borne observatories and advances in the sensitivity of 
ground-based telescopes have found evidence that disks routinely form around 
young stars, but they do not last very long. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Terrile of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Brad Smith of the 
University of Arizona captured a dramatic photograph of a star known as Beta 
Pictoris, showing a band of infrared radiation around its central core, 
indicating the presence of a disk. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers Steven Beckwith of Cornell University and Anneila Sargent of 
Caltech took that one step further and discovered several young stars with 
disks. But their evidence suggests that a disk lasts only through a star's 
infancy. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings support that. 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team of Steve and Karen Strom of the University of 
Massachusetts found that 60% of the stars they looked at showed signs of a 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
"But as they age, stars lose the infrared signature," Steve Strom said. 
</P>
<P>
The disk disappears by the time a star is only about 3 million to 10 million 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves astronomers with the predicament of having evidence that disks are 
a common part of star formation, but with real difficulties in showing how a 
system like the sun's should be able to form before the star blows the gas and 
dust away. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, can you form planets before the solar nebula goes away?" 
asked astronomer Peter Bodenheimer of Lick Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Does that suggest that our solar system is possibly unique, an aberration in 
the star formation process? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not, most experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to find that planetary systems occur rather frequently in nature," 
Black, of the Lunar and Planetary Institute, said. 
</P>
<P>
That optimism is supported by a team of Canadian astronomers who announced two 
years ago that they had detected evidence of planets orbiting around at least 
two nearby stars. The stars are so bright, and the planets so dim, that it is 
not possible to see them, but astronomer Bruce Campbell, who led the Canadian 
team, insists they are there. 
</P>
<P>
Planets would not simply travel in perfect circles around a stationary star. 
Instead, the entire system would orbit around a point at the center of the 
system's mass. 
</P>
<P>
That would cause the star to "wobble" slightly, Campbell said. Sometimes the 
star would appear to be moving slightly closer to a distant observer, and at 
other times it would appear to be receding. 
</P>
<P>
But since the star is so much more massive than the planets, the point around 
which everything rotates would still be within the star, just slightly off 
center. That, in turn, makes detection a formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are now proposing some extremely sophisticated telescopes in hopes 
of finally resolving the issue. All of the telescopes would have to be placed 
in orbit because the measurements are so exacting that the Earth's atmosphere 
would distort the results. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Eugene Levy of the University of Arizona believes it should be 
possible to detect planets through a process known as "astrometry." That 
involves tracking stars so precisely that any deviation -- such as that caused 
by orbiting planets -- could be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
A star with planets should travel in small circles. That would cause a slight 
change in the angle when viewed from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But what a tiny change it would be. 
</P>
<P>
Levy tried to dramatize that point in a presentation during the Berkeley 
symposium. Standing behind a lectern, Levy tapped the side of a light on top of 
the speaker's stand. 
</P>
<P>
He told his listeners to look at him while sighting along the side of the 
light. Then, he said, move in along the light the width of one atom. That's 
right, one atom. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the angle is comparable to what the orbiting observatory would 
have to measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking small here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it takes years for large planets to orbit a star, so the 
observatory would have to work flawlessly for 10 to 20 years, unattended, in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
It would be so sensitive to movement that even if astronauts could get up to it 
they could not touch it, so "it would not be possible to go up there and diddle 
with it from time to time," he added. William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research 
Center in Mountain View has proposed a system that could detect planets more 
quickly, but it is at least as demanding as Levy's. 
</P>
<P>
Borucki said that if a planet orbiting another star passes between the observer 
and the star, it would block out part of the star's light during its transit. 
An extremely sensitive orbiting observatory should be able to detect that drop 
in luminosity if the planet is in an orbit close to the star. 
</P>
<P>
Borucki's plan would have the advantage of detecting Earth-like planets that 
might be in the proper orbit to sustain life, but the precision demanded by 
such an observatory is mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
"Planets are small and stars are large, so your signal is not going to be very 
strong," Borucki said. "But it's within the realm of possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even he admits, "It would take a real act of courage to say you've found a 
planet." 
</P>
<P>
JPL's Terrile believes the only way people are going to be satisfied that there 
are planets out there is if they can see them. That is not possible with 
existing technology because planets are so dim compared to stars that it would 
be comparable to seeing a lighted match in front of a glaring searchlight. 
</P>
<P>
"A planet the size of Jupiter would be about one billion times fainter than its 
star," Terrile said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Terrile is working on a NASA proposal to develop a telescope that 
would block out the light of the star and still be sensitive enough to see the 
planet. The telescope would need a five-foot mirror free of microscopic 
imperfections. And it would have to remain so even after being launched into 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever built such a perfect mirror, but Terrile is working with the 
people who fabricated the optics for the Hubble Space Telescope and he believes 
it may be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Many astronomers are eager to see devices such as these made available, because 
they are convinced that planetary systems abound throughout the universe. All 
of that gas and dust surrounding newborn stars ends up someplace, and they see 
no reason why the sun's planetary system should be unique. 
</P>
<P>
But a few suggest that in many cases stellar disks form something else entirely 
-- the dreaded "brown dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the gas and dust left over after star formation simply form 
another star, many theorists have argued, but there isn't enough of it for the 
star to get massive enough to ignite. If so, there could be trillions of "brown 
dwarfs" in the galaxy, small stars that are too dim to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
It would greatly diminish the number of planetary systems -- and thus the 
chances of intelligent life elsewhere -- if many stellar disks accrete into 
brown dwarfs instead of planets. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists, however, see no reason to think the Earth is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found any reason to think that a planetary system is unique or a 
miraculous thing," said Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institute. 
</P>
<P>
If that turns out to be wrong, it would suddenly become a very lonely universe.

JAPANESE CAUTIOUS ABOUT INVESTING HEAVILY IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where the Land of the Rising Sun meets the Aztec Sol, the future is very 
bright. At least that's the message that Mexican officials hope Japanese Prime 
Minister Toshika Kaifu will take back to Japanese investors this week from his 
visit to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
With its new regulations liberalizing foreign investment, the administration of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been aggressively courting Japanese 
investment in tourism, petrochemical, assembly plant and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, groups of Japanese businessmen visit Mexico to tour the beaches of 
Cancun and the Baja California peninsula, or the industrial cities of Monterrey 
and Tijuana. While encouraged by the government's spirit of free enterprise, 
Japanese bankers and businessmen so far have been cautious about launching 
projects in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the investment environment is more favorable, the Japanese investor 
is taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Masami Tsutsumimoto, representative of 
the Bank of Tokyo in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that even the new investment rules are still not that 
clear," said Rafael Valenzuela, spokesman for the Japanese External Trade 
Organization in Mexico. "There are gaps in the interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela added, however, that he expects a boost to Japanese investment from 
Kaifu's visit beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, this will strengthen ties between the two countries. It sends a 
signal to investors," Valenzuela said of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic attraction, President Salinas seems to have a 
personal interest in Japan. The Harvard-educated Salinas has his two children 
in the Japanese-Mexican Lycee, a school that he has said he selected for the 
Japanese emphasis on discipline and design. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas himself visited Japan in 1986 as Budget and Planning Minister under the 
administration of President Miguel de la Madrid. It was there, according to a 
government source, during a meeting with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, that 
Salinas realized the potential of Japanese investments and of the Japanese 
market for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Salinas has publicly emphasized that Mexico is a country on the 
Pacific and should be incorporated into the Pacific Rim economy. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the fourth-largest investor in Mexico, after the United States, 
Britain and West Germany. Japanese investments in Mexico nearly doubled from 
1983 to 1988, to $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Investors are attracted by Mexico's raw materials, its inexpensive labor, with 
a minimum wage of about $3 a day, and, most important, by its proximity to the 
United States. Mexico also provides a door to the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
But still, Japanese investment represents only 5.5% of foreign investment in 
Mexico, and businessmen say there are many drawbacks -- one of which is the 
United States. Japan views Mexico as the United States' back yard and does not 
want to add to U.S.-Japanese trade problems with friction over Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considers United States 
</P>
<P>
Japan holds 17% of Mexico's nearly $100-billion foreign debt and doubled its 
membership on the advisory committee of banks that negotiated an agreement to 
reduce Mexico's debt earlier this year. But the role of the Japanese in that 
negotiation was largely to support the United States, according to Japanese and 
Mexican sources. Under the final agreement, Japan provided $2 billion toward a 
fund to secure payment on the reduced loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government would like to help Mexico, but always considering the 
U.S. position and making good relations with the United States," said Yoshikazu 
Kameyama, representative of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese banks and businessmen still feel it is not easy to develop in Mexico 
except in maquiladoras (assembly plants), and these pose some conflict between 
Japan and the United States, so we promote them very carefully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 50 of the approximately 1,600 foreign-owned assembly plants in 
Mexico are Japanese, but those 50, situated along the U.S.-Mexico border, 
export all of their production to the United States. Japanese businessmen say 
they fear U.S. labor and producers may someday fight for trade barriers against 
Japanese imports from the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Kameyama said his bank is bullish on Mexico and is considering financing a 
hotel development in Cancun, a joint venture between the Japanese International 
Development Organization and Mexican investors. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also will hold a seminar in Tokyo this fall to explain the new 
Mexican regulations permitting 100% foreign ownership in some industries and 
minority foreign investment in industries that previously were off-limits to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Do Even More 
</P>
<P>
The seminar is to pave the way for a visit by Mexican Secretary of Commerce and 
Finance Jaime Serra Puche and Tourism Secretary Hank Gonzalez to Tokyo to 
promote investment in Mexico. The officials are stressing that Mexico also has 
deregulated the trucking industry to bring down costs and opened the production 
of most petrochemicals to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
But other investors and analysts say the Mexican government will have to do 
even more if it hopes to lure investment away from Japan's back yard -- 
Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese analysts say there are still many drawbacks to Mexico, including a 
lack of quality control on raw materials such as iron and copper, a shortage of 
mid-level management and skilled labor, and problems with the Mexican 
industrial infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican mail and telephone systems also leave much to be desired, Japanese 
businessmen say. In many areas roads and water supply are insufficient. 
Although the Salinas government has broken many unions, the Japanese feel that 
labor is still too strong in areas in which they might invest, such as in 
fishing and petrochemicals.

SINGLE-MINDED MERCHANTS;

TO SUCCEED, SUPER-SPECIALTY RETAILERS MUST OVERWHELM BUYERS WITH WACKINESS OR

Phyllis Cowan crossed a fine line in retailing five years ago when she decided 
to leave the lamp business and start selling an item that more and more 
customers kept requesting: light bulbs. Lots of light bulbs. All shapes and 
sizes and colors of light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was crazy," said Cowan, owner of Light Bulbs Unlimited in 
Santa Monica. "Nobody could really believe that you could have a store just 
selling light bulbs." 
</P>
<P>
Well you can, and Cowan does. With the help of sons Peter and Robin, Cowan is 
about to launch a third Light Bulbs Unlimited in the Los Angeles area and has 
also franchised two in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Dorothy remembers a similar reaction from his friends when he revealed 
plans to open a store selling nothing but rubber stamps in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very caring about me but they didn't want to encourage me to do 
something so ludicrous," said Dorothy, whose store, called Stampa Barbara, 
bills itself as the world's largest rubber stamp store. Dorothy also owns a 
version on trendy Melrose Avenue, an outlet much smaller than the 75,000-stamp 
mother store. 
</P>
<P>
This is not business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
In this era of specialty retailing, shoppers are no longer surprised by many of 
the stores they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants carrying nothing but T-shirts or earrings or Christmas decorations or 
sweat clothes or sunglasses or music boxes or model trains don't jolt a 
dedicated buyer's spending urge the way that they once did. Retailers 
specializing in ties, socks and even hats are, frankly, old hat. 
</P>
<P>
But among the specialists is a subset of salesmanship that might be called 
niche marketing, super-specialty retailing or just plain old weird stores. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
* The Wound &amp; Wound Toy Co. on Melrose (formerly known as Wound 'Em Up and 
The Last Wound Up) concentrates on things that wind up: items such as wind-up 
chattering teeth and antique music boxes. Prices range from $1 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
* Stephens Zippers of Pasadena sells and repairs zippers. At 6 cents per inch, 
"it's not terribly lucrative, but it's my thing," owner Daniel E. Whitlow said. 
</P>
<P>
* House of Canes &amp; Walking Sticks in North Hollywood carries those items 
starting at $10.95. Antiques can cost a few thousand dollars. "We're told all 
the time that people are so happy we exist so they don't have to have just a 
drugstore cane," said Kay Fontaine, who took over the store with her husband, 
Mark, in 1980 from the original owner. 
</P>
<P>
These types of stores tend to divide into two camps that might be dubbed Whimsy 
Gone Wild and The Mundane Multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
Falling into the first group is the entire menagerie of animal-themed stores -- 
from the more common teddy bear and cat stores to the more unusual, like Pig 
Heaven Gallery in Laguna Beach and Udderly Perfect in Santa Monica and 
Manhattan Beach. An Orange County retailer called House of Lampshades, an 
excellent companion to Light Bulbs Unlimited, belongs in the second category, 
as does Plastic Mart of Santa Monica, which peddles a plethora of plastic items 
and does custom work in acrylic and Lucite. 
</P>
<P>
Such stores are reminiscent of the old "Saturday Night Live" television show 
sketch about the Scotch Tape store. It had very few customers, which the 
tartan-clad owners blamed on the new mall down the street rather than on the 
fact that they sold nothing but Scotch Tape. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, many super-specialty stores appear to be thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Retail consultant Larry Ebel described it as a "harnesses-for-sea horses" 
phenomenon that represents the ultimate in retailing's move away from general, 
no-frills stores where customers had to fend for themselves back to the 
service-oriented specialty outlets that were the norm in the early part of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialty Bookstores 
</P>
<P>
"It's not totally revolutionary," said Ebel, senior vice president of Retail 
Planning Associates, a retail planning and consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio. 
"In Paris, you can go to a store that sells just ribbons or antique posters. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, so many people have so many bases covered that if you're not different, 
the competition is even more fierce," he said. "If it works, it works, and if 
it doesn't, it doesn't, and there's not the stigma in failing in retailing that 
there once was." 
</P>
<P>
Very specific stores have benefited too from an "upscaling" of regional 
shopping centers that would not have been able to support unusual stores 
several years ago, Ebel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some independent bookstores went to specialization partly as a haven from the 
well-financed bookstore chains that flourished in the past decade, said John K. 
Baker, editor of Publishers Weekly, a trade publication. Now bookstores selling 
only mysteries, science fiction, travel books, guidebooks or books for children 
are becoming more common, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's in response to the outpouring from specialized publishers that 
chains, in their much more generalized approach, don't seem able to stock and 
sell," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Lest one think that the unusual is confined only to Southern California, 
extremely specialized retailers can be found in most major metropolitan areas, 
although "it's hard to find the equivalent of Melrose in Columbus, Ohio," Ebel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
New York is home not only to Just Bulbs and Just Shades, but to Tender Buttons, 
a veritable museum of such clothing closures. Cleveland has Just Bags, which 
has been selling women's handbags for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Washington boasts The Map Store (it sells maps) and Political Americana (it 
sells political memorabilia). The Detroit area apparently has enough demand for 
sequins to support three branches of House of Sequins. 
</P>
<P>
These super-specialized merchants say they survive because they provide a 
certain expertise or scratch a certain consumer itch that other retailers 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
House of Batteries in Costa Mesa regularly sees customers who are referred by 
consumer electronic, drug and department stores, said owner Bill Lusk. The 
store sells or makes batteries for "pretty much anything that takes a battery," 
including watches, cameras, calculators and hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan of Light Bulbs Unlimited can speak for hours about the benefits of the 
pure white of halogen bulbs, the long life of mercury vapor bulbs and the 
merits of various shades of white florescent bulbs. Her stores also do custom 
neon work and sell a small selection of unusual lamps. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy said he and the staff of Stampa Barbara have picked up more than one 
customer who flew into town only to visit the rubber stamp store. 
</P>
<P>
The life span of strange stores can be relatively short as fads fade. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Walker, owner of The Bear Tree in Anaheim, said the 6-year-old store 
stopped selling only bears and bear-related merchandise a few years ago because 
customers kept asking for other animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell about 3 to 1, bears versus other plush animals, but we would hate to 
lose that one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you rely on one product, if your product goes so goes your store," 
Dorothy said. Still, that prospect doesn't bother him, Dorothy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about a lot of things, but that's not very high on my list," he said. 
Rubber stampers "are real devotees. People come from Timbuktu to shop here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everything Sells Itself 
</P>
<P>
Wound &amp; Wound owner Jody Golub said his store has been going strong for 
four years on a cross-section of toy collectors, impulse buyers and office 
workers looking for something unusual to jazz up their desks. 
</P>
<P>
"We just entertain people," he said. "We move them from place to place in the 
store, and everything sells itself." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these companies do have long track records. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlow of Stephens Zippers has sold and fixed zippers for about 23 years. 
House of Batteries has hummed along for 20 years. Plastic Mart grew out of a 
fiberglass surfboard repair business that owner Ralph Nahigian started 28 years 
ago.

LUCKY MERGER CASE TESTS LIMITS OF ANTITRUST LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early last Tuesday, an American Stores executive sounded elated as he chatted 
with a supermarket competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all over, and we're really thrilled," he said, confident that a federal 
judge in Los Angeles would soon erect an insurmountable hurdle for the state 
attorney general in his effort to block the planned merger of the company's 
Lucky and Alpha Beta food chains. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon, though, American Stores executives' hopes were dashed 
when the judge drastically slashed a bond requirement in the case, making it 
feasible for California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to pursue his antitrust 
case with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
One year into American Stores' battle with Van de Kamp, to say that the Salt 
Lake City-based supermarket and drug store operator miscalculated the extent of 
Van de Kamp's zeal is a massive understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The fight has consumed time, resources and millions of dollars and, supermarket 
analysts say, has cost American Stores momentum in gaining share in the hotly 
competitive California market. Moreover, American Stores contends, the delay in 
merging the chains has cost it $1.5 million a week in duplicate costs. 
</P>
<P>
It has often seemed a high-stakes game of Ping-Pong, with each side savoring 
fleeting victories only to suffer setbacks as the case has bounced through 
ruling after ruling and appeal after appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone could write a book about what happens to a case when it gets caught up 
in the legal process," one attorney involved in it groused recently. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, as American Stores pondered its next step, legal authorities 
were sharply divided in their views of whether the U.S. Supreme Court would 
vote to review the case and how the court battle might affect future merger 
attempts. While some see the long-running case dampening enthusiasm for 
mergers, others feel that the issues involved are narrow and technical and that 
the unusual circumstances are not likely to recur. 
</P>
<P>
Given the Reagan Administration's relaxed attitude toward acquisitions, many 
observers said American Stores was justified in assuming last summer that its 
merger would waltz through. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FTC Gives Approval 
</P>
<P>
American Stores proceeded with its $2.5-billion acquisition of Lucky Stores in 
June, 1988, with the intention of merging Alpha Beta with Lucky and operating 
both under the Lucky banner. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the Federal Trade Commission, which scrutinized the merger 
for possible anti-competitive effects, gave the go-ahead, with the proviso that 
37 stores should be sold. (Between them, Lucky and Alpha Beta now have about 
550 stores.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vons, a big competitor, had just completed its purchase of Safeway's 
Southern California stores after agreeing to an FTC demand that it sell 12 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Van de Kamp, the chief advocate for California's consumers and a 
Democratic gubernatorial hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, a day after the FTC approved the merger of Alpha Beta and Lucky, he 
challenged the plan on the grounds that the consolidation would reduce 
competition and raise food prices throughout the state. A year later, some see 
political motives in his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Van de Kamp is running for governor is why this case has moved as far 
as it has," contended Jonathan H. Ziegler, a supermarket analyst with the Sutro 
&amp; Co. brokerage house in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ziegler and other analysts see as fundamentally flawed Van de Kamp's 
contention that the merger would result in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep Alpha Beta and Lucky discrete, you are not going to reduce 
prices," he said. "If you merge them, you will. (American Stores) is fighting a 
market share battle with handcuffs on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Is Likely 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the basic question of competition, however, the case poses an 
opportunity for the Supreme Court to resolve an issue over which lower courts 
have disagreed: Can a private party -- somebody other than the U.S. government 
-- order divestiture after a merger has been completed instead of trying to 
stop it in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
That issue so intrigued Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that two 
weeks ago she wrote a non-binding opinion stating that "given the conflict 
among the lower courts on this important and recurring issue and the need for 
uniform enforcement of federal antitrust laws, I think it fair to say that 
there is a reasonable probability" that the Supreme Court justices will review 
the case once they reconvene in October. 
</P>
<P>
With his case, the attorney general hopes to overturn a 1975 decision by the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. In International Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph Corp. vs. General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp., the court 
ruled that, under the federal Clayton Antitrust Act, a private party could not 
win divestiture as a remedy. In other words, after a merger had gone through, 
it could not be undone. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, ITT was challenging 17 years of acquisitions that it said gave 
General Telephone undue market power. 
</P>
<P>
H. Chester (Chet) Horn, deputy attorney general, contended last week that the 
appeals court was influenced by potential difficulty of undoing deals that were 
several years old. 
</P>
<P>
He added that other courts have disagreed with the 9th Circuit and have allowed 
divestiture. Moreover, he said, "the Supreme Court has also been clear and 
consistent in interpreting (the Clayton Act to say) that trial courts are 
empowered to order whatever injunctive relief they feel necessary to prevent or 
undo the antitrust harm which confronts them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appealing Issue 
</P>
<P>
In the Lucky/Alpha Beta case, both the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and 
the 9th Circuit agree that the attorney general has provided ample evidence of 
"irreparable harm" to consumers if the merger goes through. But the 9th Circuit 
ruled that the attorney general's effort to keep Lucky and Alpha Beta separate 
amounted to an indirect form of divestiture, which was not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is appealing that issue to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand the case, it basically tests the limits of California 
antitrust law," said Malcolm R. Pfunder, a Washington attorney who chairs the 
American Bar Assn.'s Clayton Act Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Given the narrowness of the issue, Pfunder finds it unlikely that the Supreme 
Court will review the case, despite O'Connor's opinion that it is worthy of 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the issue . . . is not necessarily a matter that requires 
resolution for antitrust law to continue to survive and function," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, one expert on antitrust figures that the case could dampen merger 
mania. 
</P>
<P>
"This case, in a sense, has already had far-reaching effects," said Lawrence A. 
Sullivan, Earl Warren professor of public law at UC Berkeley and author of a 
1977 book called "Antitrust." "Even if the Supreme Court doesn't review the 
case, it indicates that state enforcement is to be taken seriously, that people 
planning mergers are not home free when they clear the federal hurdle."

CONTRACT WENT TO SOUTH KOREA; 
</P>
<P>
LOCKHEED WORKERS HOLD SAVINGS BOND PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed workers, angered over an aircraft parts contract awarded last week by 
the firm to Daewoo Heavy Industries of South Korea, have organized a protest in 
which they said they are canceling their participation in a U.S. savings bond 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Daewoo worth up to 
$109 million for wing assembly work on the Navy P-7A anti-submarine patrol 
aircraft, one of the first times that military work has been contracted 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The symbolic protest was organized spontaneously by employees and not formally 
endorsed by the union, according to officials at the International Assn. of 
Machinists, which represents workers. The bond drive is part of a regular 
payroll deduction savings plan. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined how many workers had made the protest, but five 
employees who were interviewed by The Times said it was widespread throughout 
the Lockheed Burbank plant and was starting at the Palmdale plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I canceled mine the day I read the article (about the Korean award) and so did 
everybody else in my department," said Lockheed shipping clerk Carrie Thomas. 
"We could do that work here." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale confirmed that some workers had withdrawn from 
the program in protest but said he did not have a count of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that employees would choose to do this as a way of striking 
back at the company for something they perceive as a problem," Ragsdale said. 
"It is not a problem for those employees at Lockheed Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
But employees said they were outraged that Lockheed would subcontract U.S. 
military work overseas when it was laying off U.S. workers and had shut down a 
plant in Watts only last year because of a lack of work. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are really angry about this," said Leon Washington, a Lockheed 
production worker, who said he collected cancellations from 67 co-workers in 
his department. "We want to know why they would send this work to Korea when 
they shut down the Watts plant and laid those guys off." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Andrade, a union steward, estimated that 99% of the three dozen workers 
in his immediate area chose to join the protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this could go on and on, like the automobile industry," Andrade said. 
"It upsets everybody." 
</P>
<P>
But Ragsdale said the wing assembly work to be performed by Daewoo was 
historically contracted out to a foreign nation, Canada, in the P-3 program, 
the predecessor of the P-7. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody is losing work, it is the people in Canada," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale also noted that Lockheed received bids from two other firms and 
conducted a study of what it would cost the firm to build the wing at its own 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Daewoo was "lower than the other bidders and they were significantly lower than 
our own studies showed would be the cost of Lockheed doing the work in house in 
the United States," Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
But such rationale provided little solace to workers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they think our labor is too high, maybe they should get somebody from South 
Korea to run our country," said Thomas, the clerk. "They are crippling our 
country by sending all of this work overseas. The American people have nothing 
but poverty. I hate the fact that they are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought some workers' reaction to Korea was different from their 
reaction had it been Canada, Ragsdale remarked: "I don't know. That gets into 
areas of what individual employee's ethnic prejudices are, and I don't know 
what they are." 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale acknowledged that Americans are growing concerned about economic 
competition from low-wage Asian nations, but noted, "Korea does not have an 
airplane industry. We see no evidence that Korea is developing an industry that 
would become competitive with this country." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Lockheed must place some of its work in foreign nations if 
it expects to sell weapons to those countries, an arrangement called an 
"offset." But Lockheed officials were careful to note that Daewoo won the 
contract because it outbid others and not because of preferential treatment.

JAPANESE TAKE FULL CONTROL OF THE RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Riviera Country Club &amp; Tennis Club, once a favorite haunt of early 
Hollywood film stars, entered a new era of foreign ownership Sunday with the 
transfer of full ownership of the landmark 168-acre resort to Marukin Shoji Co. 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The change of ownership Sunday -- considered a lucky day in Japan -- was 
uneventful compared to the disclosure last spring that Laaco Ltd. was selling 
the club to a mystery Japanese buyer for $108 million. The secrecy sparked 
criticism and concern among some Riviera club members. As a result, Marukin 
scaled back and bought only a 49% interest a year ago but was given an option 
to buy the remaining interest in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin, which acquired the remaining 51% for $55.08 million cash, appears to 
have placated those concerns among members by hosting get-acquainted receptions 
like that held Sunday after the formal completion of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We have contacted the membership to assure them that we do not intend to 
change the basic policies of either the country club or the tennis club," said 
Noboro Watanabe, senior managing director of Marukin. "We purchased the clubs 
because of their fine reputation and high caliber of members. We issued the 
statement last year saying there will be no assessments or additional 
initiation fees, nor is it our wish to inflate the membership." He said the 
club plans improvements in both the golf and tennis clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enjoyed our association with Marukin," said Frank G. Hathaway, 
managing partner of Laaco, "and we wish them well in this new chapter of 
Riviera's history." 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway's grandfather Frank A. Garbutt founded the Riviera in 1927. It was a 
favorite hangout for film stars Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Errol 
Flynn. Today, it is the site of the annual Los Angeles Open Golf Tournament, 
known to golfers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Laaco's ownership of the Los Angeles Athletic Club and the California Yacht 
Club continues unchanged.

Steel Prices Hit 2-Year Low: Due to reduced demand, steel prices have fallen to 
their lowest level in nearly two years, while operating rates at U.S. steel 
mills stood at 76% at the end of August, down from 89.5% in the same period 
last year. Prices for flat-rolled steel averaged $375 a ton in August, 
according to Philadelphia economic forecasting firm the AUS Group.

Machine Tool Exports Rise: The United States exported 25.9% more machine tools 
in June than in May, but imports remained high, meaning a continued trade gap 
with other countries, the National Machine Tool Builders Assn. reported. It 
said imports, which are running at three times the level of exports, fell 5.5% 
during that period but were still a solid 24.5% higher than a year ago. In 
June, the United States exported a total of $80.7 million in machine tools, 
compared to $69.1 million in May.

ARCHITECTURE: THE WRIGHT STUFF; 
</P>
<P>
IN MALIBU, A NEW HOUSE BY THE MASTER DESIGNER WILL BE BUILT FROM PLANS THAT 
WERE NEVER USED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Mexico developer Charles Klotsche fell in love with the architecture of 
Frank Lloyd Wright by chance. Looking for a way to set his life on a new course 
after a divorce in the early 1980s, Klotsche came across Wright's work while 
idly leafing through a published copy of one of the Master's sketchbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overwhelmed by Wright's talent," he said. "At the same, time my 
developer's nostrils twitched with a fresh scent when I discovered that a 
number of Wright's house designs had never been built." 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Santa Fe, Klotsche was particularly struck by Wright's 
drawings for a unique adobe dwelling known as the "Pottery House." He wangled 
an introduction to the architect's widow, his third wife, Olgivanna, and, after 
much persuasion, cut a deal to buy the Pottery House plans for $125,000 from 
the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, which she controlled at the time. Klotsche 
built the adobe dwelling near Santa Fe, and sold it to fashion designer Calvin 
Klein for a handsome profit in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Now Klotsche is planning to build a second Wright residence, known as the 
"Boulder House," on a spectacular site in Point Dume, Malibu, which he hopes to 
sell for around $7 million when completed next year. Working with Taliesen 
Associated Architects of Scottsdale, Arizona -- the practicing inheritors of 
Wright's old studio in Taliesen West -- Klotsche is as faithful to the original 
design in Malibu as he was in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Santa Fe and Malibu houses were planned for different cities than the 
ones that finally gave them a home. The Pottery House was designed for a couple 
in Santa Fe in 1939, but the husband's death in World War II canceled the 
project. The Boulder House, designed in the early 1950s a few years before 
Wright's death, was intended as a winter retreat for Pittsburg, Pa., department 
store magnate Edgar Kaufmann in Palm Springs. Because of a family divorce, the 
house was never built, and the plans remained buried in the Wright Foundation 
archives at Taliesen West until Klotsche unearthed them. 
</P>
<P>
"Fallingwater," the house Wright designed for Kaufmann in Bear Run, Pa., in 
1935 is one of the most famous modern residences in the United States. Poised 
spectacularly over a waterfall in a forest, Fallingwater's cantilevered 
terraces seem to strain at anchor like a high-spirited yacht eager to set sail. 
"Inhabit the place that you love," Wright told Kaufmann, to persuade his client 
that his favorite spot beside a wooded stream was a suitable site for an 
expensive house. 
</P>
<P>
The Boulder House, as it was designed and as it will be built, is also 
surrounded by water, but in static pools, as befits a desert design. Transposed 
to a Malibu canyon above Pacific Coast Highway, the house is a series of 
sweeping arcs embracing long views. The boulders that give the design its name 
are featured in a dramatic chimney tower. Three copper roofs, resembling 
upturned boat bottoms, give the 6,200-square-foot residence the air of a 
beached ship upended to shelter shipwreck survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest of the house's three boat-shaped sections encloses the curved 
living room and the master bedroom suite. The ovoid west wing has two more 
bedrooms, and the east wing houses the dining room with its arc of french doors 
overlooking the moat that runs the length of the main frontage. A second floor 
study over the master bedroom has a huge balcony that cantilevers over the 
pool. An extension beside the rear motor court entry completes the spectacular 
layout. 
</P>
<P>
"All Frank Lloyd Wright's dwellings had kitchens and bathrooms that are too 
small for today's requirements," said Charles Montooth, the Taliesen Associated 
Architects designer who has worked with Klotsche on adapting both the Pottery 
and Boulder houses. "Expanding these facilities without damaging Wright's 
original concept is one of the challenges we face. Plus the fact that Frank 
Lloyd Wright left no details (detail drawings for cabinetry and other finishes) 
for the Boulder House, so we must draw upon the design vocabulary evidenced in 
the archives." 
</P>
<P>
Montooth commends Klotsche as a "truly sympathetic client." He remembers that 
Mrs. Wright, who died in 1985, was suspicious of the developer at first. 
"Olgivanna had the last word in these matters," Montooth said, "and it took all 
of Charles' charm to convince her he was the man to carry out the holy task of 
completing the Master's conception." 
</P>
<P>
In discovering that around 140 of Wright's 700-plus designs had never been 
built, Klotsche feels he has struck gold. "I found at least a dozen house plans 
that made my mouth water," he recalled. "If I manage to continue, it could 
become a lifetime's mission to realize most of these superb residences." 
</P>
<P>
And a profitable one. Advised by local real estate agents, Klotsche decided on 
Malibu as the most potentially lucrative location for the Boulder House. The 
raw three-acre Point Dume site, located close to Barbra Streisand's estate, ran 
a cool $1.2 million, and Klotsche estimates the house will cost a similar 
amount to construct. He expects to clear around $3 million on the Boulder House 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Klotsche, 47, moved to Los Angeles six months ago to take advantage of the 
burgeoning local high-end real estate market. "The Santa Fe property scene is 
more or less played out," he said, "but L.A. is a bonanza for people who do 
things right. People will pay the limit for the right location with the right 
estate and a Wright house." 
</P>
<P>
The fashion for Wright's "organic" architecture, which fell out of favor among 
architects for several decades after World War II, has revived strongly in 
recent years. Wright's furniture is now being reproduced with great success, 
and his career as a great American original has begun to be appreciated by a 
new generation of designers in this Post- and Late-Modern period. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic means, in a philosophic sense, entity," Wright explained in a 1953 
NBC-TV interview, "where the whole is to the part as the part is to the whole, 
and where the nature of materials, the nature of the purpose, the nature of the 
entire performance becomes a necessity . . . (so that) it graces its 
environment rather than disgraces it." 
</P>
<P>
Put more simply, an organic house design is all of a piece from its concept to 
its details, and should seem as if it grew out of the landscape as naturally as 
a tree or shrub. In this way, Kaufmann's dramatic Fallingwater was inspired by 
the stream it bridges. "I think you can hear the waterfall when you look at the 
design," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the profound marriage of house and site that distinguishes Wright's 
architecture, how does a developer justify transferring a design from the 
dun-colored Palm Springs desert to the seaside slopes of Malibu? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel you can transfer the design and update it to a more contemporary 
setting if you are faithful to the original idea," Klotsche claimed. "You just 
have to take great care not to compromise the authenticity of the concept. If I 
hadn't been able to convince Mrs. Wright that I would honor her husband's 
architecture all the way, no matter what the cost, she would never have let me 
loose on either the Pottery or the Boulder house."

ALL-STARR SHOW: RINGO'S CHARM IS BOTTOM LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ringo Starr spent most of his own show on Saturday at the Pacific Amphitheatre 
in eclipse behind his helpful friends. But at the very end, the fourth Beatle 
stepped out from behind his drums and put an engaging stamp on the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, who ends the first solo tour of his career tonight at the Greek Theatre, 
got off to a flat start fronting his All-Starr Band. Decked out in a 
ringmaster's silver tux emblazoned with stars, and jumping up and down or 
shifting back and forth from foot to foot in an awkward dance, Ringo had the 
uneasy look of an entertainer trying too hard to make up in enthusiasm for what 
he lacks in natural gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Starr's song introductions were perfunctory, with the famous drollery that has 
given him his niche in pop culture nowhere in evidence. "No No Song," a novelty 
hit about saying goodby to immoderate habits, received a hurried treatment in 
which the newly on-the-wagon Starr failed to exploit the song's comic 
possibilities. "Yellow Submarine" was forced and premature. Only a mood of fun 
and bonhomie could have made the old Beatles sing-along work, and Starr had 
established nothing of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
After three songs, Ringo retreated to his drum kit. He seemed more at home 
there, smiling and keeping the beat with a sway of his head and a flap of his 
ponytail. He sang four oldies from his seated perch, but mainly let All-Starrs 
Dr. John, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Billy Preston, Clarence Clemons, Joe Walsh 
and Nils Lofgren take turns in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the end, Starr came back out front and put a warm shine on the night. 
Through a show-closing run of hits -- "Photograph," "You're Sixteen" and an 
encore version of "With a Little Help From My Friends" -- Ringo was a smiling, 
delightful neo-vaudevillian who capered about joyfully while making all the 
hokey moves that fell flat earlier seem somehow full of life. 
</P>
<P>
Starr also tossed out some nice deadpan Ringo-isms. He sang "You're not 16" to 
an audience that probably averaged more than twice that. And he mused on the 
absurdity of the meaningless, pre-planned pop encore: "You know we're coming 
back. We know we're coming back. Show biz. Show biz is my life." 
</P>
<P>
As for the All-Starrs, the World's Wealthiest Bar Band might have been a more 
descriptive name, as they knocked out predictable favorites with few attempts 
at risk or surprise. Still, each member except Walsh contributed some strong 
moments to a 26-song set that lasted longer than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Preston was like an explosive off-the-bench scorer in basketball, 
providing instant energy when called upon. His duet with Clemons, "You're a 
Friend of Mine," was especially spirited and comradely. 
</P>
<P>
After Ringo's awkward start, Dr. John lifted the show with the funky New 
Orleans parade anthem "Iko Iko," during which he strutted in an elaborately 
feathered Mardi Gras headdress. Danko and Helm, both alumni of the Band, 
harmonized in their familiar style. Along with Lofgren, the E Street Band 
guitarist whose singing and playing are both choked with impressive emotion, 
they provided most of the earnest passion in a show given over mainly to 
lighthearted songs. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh turned in some good guitar work, but he squandered his spotlight moments, 
which included a slogging "Rocky Mountain Way." For some reason, Walsh figured 
his past as an Eagle qualified him to sing "Desperado" and "Life in the Fast 
Lane," songs that other Eagles originally sang. Walsh's stringy voice certainly 
was no qualification. 
</P>
<P>
Session drummer Jim Keltner was on hand as well, proving, in a troika with 
Starr and Helm, that more drummers do not necessarily make for more interesting 
drumming. (Starr's son, Zack Starkey, filled in on drums during his dad's turns 
out front.) The beat throughout was as basic as three times one. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, luckily, Starr's appeal was equally basic: He's Ringo, and all he's 
gotta do is act naturally.

BATTLING IT OUT IN SYNDICATION; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S INSIDE 'INSIDE REPORT' IS PRETTY DUMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You knew it would happen. The replication of TV tabloids is now underway, as TV 
increasingly resembles a supermarket checkout counter. 
</P>
<P>
And if one "A Current Affair" weren't enough, here's another. 
</P>
<P>
The syndicated clone is "Inside Report" (no relation to the syndicated "Inside 
Edition"), which sort of unofficially kicks off the new fall season tonight. It 
premieres on KCOP Channel 13, which is running two half-hour editions nightly 
from 7 to 8 this week in advance of next Monday, when single episodes will 
begin airing in the show's regular 5:30 p.m. time slot. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13 vows that "Inside Report" is on the "cutting edge of the evolving 
state of reality programming." More accurately, it's on the cutting edge of the 
evolving state of numbing dumbness. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by WSVN-TV in Miami, where it's been running eight months, "Inside 
Report" has copied the tone and graphics of Fox's syndicated "A Current 
Affair," and the KCOP show's snide host, Penny Daniels -- check the raised 
eyebrows and mocking sideward glances -- is a sort of Maury Povich in drag. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 p.m. episodes for tonight through Wednesday weren't available for review. 
However, tonight's 7:30 edition opens with a flimsy profile of gang violence in 
Denver, followed by a story about a man who lives with nine women he considers 
his wives, followed by the latest on a grandmother who teaches voice to 
hard-rock singers. 
</P>
<P>
The gang story is a weak echo of similar stories. The husband-with-nine-wives 
piece asks if he can "sexually satisfy his flock," but not why the flock -- all 
said to be "college-educated" -- would want this kind of life style, especially 
with a man whose appeal is not immediately evident. And the singing grandma 
story is a nice idea that is underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, this is all pretty tame stuff compared to what's coming, when 
"Inside Report" tackles UFOs on Tuesday at 7:30 and then dusts off Charles 
Manson on Wednesday at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
First the Manson piece, largely a rehash of his evil pedigree and featuring 
Daniels' "exclusive" interview with Manson in San Quentin, no doubt the first 
"exclusive" interview with him since Geraldo Rivera's the previous year. Like . 
. . who else wants to interview Manson? 
</P>
<P>
More than merely dated -- it was taped the day before Manson's unsuccessful 
Feb. 8 parole hearing -- the "Inside Story" interview is also mutually 
exploitative. While telling us how dangerous he is, "Inside Story" gives him 
the stage he needs to exercise his ability to persuade fruitcakes that he is 
some sort of messiah. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the process of television. The "Inside Report" people allowed Manson to 
exploit them so that they could exploit him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Daniels was in control here, shrewdly observing about Manson: "Right 
off the bat, he was menacing, intimidating. He acted like a real hardened 
criminal." Oh, no. One of those? 
</P>
<P>
Manson performs on cue, speaking almost angelically, then glowering, screaming 
at the camera and finally lurching into a wild, chaotic dance. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, Manson's quite a showman," Daniels says. "Later he admitted it 
was all an act." Oh? Then why was "Inside Report" there to record it? Because 
"Inside Report" is all an act. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this show can be serious, too, witness Tuesday's second-half episode 
that wonders aloud if "something is out there." "Something" being UFOs. 
Ooooooh. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the road, "Oprah," "Donahue" or "Geraldo" will introduce you to 
people who have dated aliens. But now the "Inside Report" investigation: 
</P>
<P>
What else but aliens could be killing and mutilating those cattle on the 
screen, and then draining their blood? The evidence is more than just 
circumstantial. The aliens' ships have been spotted and the weird beings 
themselves have been seen and touched by humans who could not possibly be 
hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
Explains one woman: "If you've ever touched a dolphin, it's that feeling." Oh, 
that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was medically examined by them," another woman says. Aha: Gynecologists from 
outer space. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, you're convinced only that aliens created "Inside Report." Beam 
me up and out of here.

BATTLING IT OUT IN SYNDICATION;

<P>
THE NEW TV SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
JOAN IS BACK; 'JEOPARDY' AND 'WHEEL' ON KCBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While his talk show flounders late at night on KCBS Channel 2, Pat Sajak and 
that colorful "Wheel of Fortune" arrive today to try to spin the CBS-owned 
station out of the early evening ratings cellar where it has languished for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 swiped "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" from KCOP Channel 13, which 
had used the two game shows to dominate the 7-8 p.m. hour for the past several 
years -- a programming coup that appears to be the most significant local 
development in a new syndicated season that will also see the return of Joan 
Rivers to daily television, the daily proliferation of big-time network sitcoms 
such as "Who's the Boss?" and "Night Court" and the birth of a physical, 
action-packed game show genre, appropriately dubbed "Crash TV." 
</P>
<P>
While considerably more attention is paid to how the networks program and 
counter-program each other in prime time, the local stations also slug it out 
for viewers with first-run syndicated fare and network repeats during key, 
locally programmed time periods. The 7-8 p.m. time slot, for example, when 
every local station carries some form of syndicated product, is the local 
stations' most lucrative hour in terms of ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Though Channel 2 would not reveal how much it paid to acquire the two top-rated 
syndicated shows in the country, officials there predicted that "Wheel of 
Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" will instantly vault their station from seventh place 
to at least second in the time period. Ed Spray, KCBS' director of 
broadcasting, said that luring such a sizable audience to the station during 
this one hour should also rub off on other time periods. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important for us to acquire these shows just to get watched again after 
a rough few years," Spray said. "If we can get the mass viewer coming to our 
station -- and we have not been successful at that at any time period for the 
last several years -- we can get our promos for the local news and even for CBS 
prime time seen. 
</P>
<P>
"And if people start watching Channel 2 again in large numbers, maybe they will 
develop an affinity for Channel 2 and maybe the habit of watching us will 
return again." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13, which last year paid a record sum to secure reruns of "The Cosby 
Show," plans to fill the void left by the departure of its top-rated game shows 
with a 6-8 p.m. weekday lineup of reruns of "Night Court," "Growing Pains," 
"The Cosby Show" and a second episode of "Night Court." 
</P>
<P>
One reason that KCOP may have let "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!" get away is the 
astronomical sum it paid for "The Cosby Show," which has been airing at 6 p.m. 
for the past year and should bring a larger return when it begins airing at 7 
p.m. next week. But Rick Feldman, KCOP's station manager, said that though 
"Jeopardy!" is still a "hot" show, his station dumped the game shows because 
they both play mostly to an older audience. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows are still highly rated, "but the name of the game is demographics, 
not household ratings," Feldman said. "Advertisers want to buy adults 18-54 and 
'Wheel' has been getting older and older and now the audience is predominantly 
50-plus. KCBS had no alternative but to pick them up, but if they think it will 
help CBS play to young viewers, they're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman predicted that with the two-hour block of high-profile sitcoms, Channel 
13 will be No. 1 in every half hour from 6-8 p.m. Plus, he said, the sitcoms' 
younger audience will be more receptive to station promotions for "The Arsenio 
Hall Show" and the station's prime-time movies than the older audience of the 
two departing game shows ever was. 
</P>
<P>
Disney-owned KHJ Channel 9 and Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11 will also compete in 
the early evening with popular network reruns. KHJ will go with "Who's the 
Boss?" and "Kate &amp; Allie" from 6-7 p.m. while KTTV counters with an hour of 
the old "Batman" series at 5:30, "Mr. Belvedere" at 6:30 and "Family Ties" at 7 
p.m. as a lead-in to its ratings smash, "A Current Affair," at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KTLA Channel 5 will rely on the first-ever reruns of the hourlong 
network dramas "Highway to Heaven" and "Hunter" from 5-7 p.m. and then will 
continue with its time-tested hour of first-run sitcoms until 8 p.m. Starting 
next Monday, original episodes of "Charles in Charge" will air daily at 7, 
followed at 7:30 p.m. by a checkerboard of original sitcoms -- "Out of This 
World," "My Secret Identity," "Punky Brewster," "The New Leave It to Beaver" 
and "The Munsters Today." 
</P>
<P>
KNBC Channel 4, the top-rated local station, will insert only one new show in 
its daily lineup, another tabloid news/entertainment magazine called "Hard 
Copy." The new program, which is co-anchored by former local newswoman Terry 
Murphy, premieres at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 18, bumping the once ballyhooed "USA 
Today on TV" to 2 a.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the local daytime scene will be the return of Joan Rivers to 
the world of talk television for the first time since her disastrous stint as 
the host of Fox's "The Late Show" ended more than two years ago. "The Joan 
Rivers Show" will enter the already heated afternoon talk wars Tuesday at 3 
p.m. on Channel 2 opposite both "Oprah" and "Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
Another Joan, "Good Morning America's" Joan Lunden, will also try her hand at a 
daytime talk show every weekday at 1 p.m. on Channel 9 beginning Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7, Channel 13 will premiere "Inside Report," a new half-hour news 
magazine in the tradition of "A Current Affair" and "Inside Edition." (The show 
is reviewed by Howard Rosenberg on Page 1.) "Inside Report" will move to its 
regular 5:30 p.m. time period next Monday. Channel 13 will also carry a new 
courtroom program, "Trial by Jury," every weekday at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Late-night television will also be filled with a few new faces. Former CBS 
newsman Ike Pappas will host "Crimewatch Tonight," a nightly program filled 
with sensational crime stories and crime prevention tips that premieres Sept. 
11 at midnight on Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
"After Hours," a glitzy magazine show that is designed as an alternative to the 
late-night talk shows, will air nightly at 11:30 on Channel 11 beginning Sept. 
18. Press releases for the show characterize it as "zapless television," 
because the program "presents stories and personalities in such a quick 
fashion, the viewer gets the impression that the channel changing is being done 
automatically." 
</P>
<P>
And beginning next week, Channel 5 will broadcast Showtime's hit sitcom 
"Brothers" every weeknight at 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Allen, formerly of "Real People," gets his own weekly late-night talk 
show this Saturday at 11:30 on Channel 7. And KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman 
gets a Saturday night show of his own on Channel 4 at 1 a.m. beginning Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 will also broadcast "Missing/Reward," a weekly syndicated program 
about missing persons that offers rewards for their return, every Saturday at 
4:30 p.m. beginning Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Crash TV comes in with a bang Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. as "Rollergames," a slam-bam 
game of brawn, roller skates and skimpy costumes that includes such hazards as 
the "Wall of Death" and a "Swamp" filled with live alligators, debuts on 
Channel 5. "Rollergames" will then move to its regular weekly time slot, 
Saturdays at 11 a.m., on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "American Gladiators," a show that features regular Joes and Janes 
from around the country battling trained athletes in contests of strength and 
speed, bows on KHJ Channel 9 Saturday, Sept. 23 at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A more traditional sports show, "Insport," a weekly program that profiles both 
the personal and professional sides of such sports stars as Magic Johnson, 
Chris Evert and Mike Tyson, premieres Sunday at 12:30 p.m. on Channel 4. The 
program will move to its regular time period, Saturdays at 4 p.m., on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"Lassie," a remake of the beloved series starring the world's most famous 
collie, will also air Saturdays beginning Sept. 23 at 6:30 p.m. on Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Edition," the tabloid news show that Channel 2 dumped to make room for 
"Wheel of Fortune," will also turn up nightly at 8:30 on Channel 9. If the 
station goes ahead with its planned nightly three hours newscast in January, 
"Inside Edition" will be bumped again.

U.S. EASING SANCTIONS ON CHINA;

3 MONTHS AFTER MASSACRE, IMPACT OF CURBS LESSENS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after the massacre of protesters in Beijing, the Bush 
Administration is gradually finding ways to ease or limit the impact of the 
moderate sanctions it has imposed on China. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, the coordinated efforts by the United States, its European allies 
and Japan have succeeded in isolating China to a degree that its leaders could 
not have imagined before they ordered the June 3-4 assault on Tian An Men 
Square by the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Where once the heads of state of the world streamed to Beijing, these days even 
a visit by the president of the African nation of Burkina Faso is a rare and 
noteworthy event. U.S. officials now estimate that a decline in tourism will 
cost China about $1 billion in foreign exchange this year and that China will 
lose another $1 billion to $2 billion in foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'World Will Come Around' 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the Chinese leadership has decided to wait things out on 
the assumption that the international pressure eventually will slacken. 
"China's overall reaction has been to take the position that the world will 
come around," said Harry Harding, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the strategy is succeeding. The Bush Administration 
has already taken small steps to restore some ties with the Chinese leadership, 
and several more such changes may be coming in the next few weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although the United States and its allies forced the World Bank to suspend 
$780 million in loans to China last June, bank officials say privately that 
they believe the Bush Administration and the Europeans and Japanese will give 
the green light within the next month to proceed with some of these loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker Met Foreign Minister 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Bush ruled out any exchanges between U.S. officials and the 
Chinese government at the level of assistant secretary or higher. But in 
August, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen in Paris, and sources say that the two men may talk again at the 
United Nations this month. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Han Xu had 
official meetings with Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Baker and National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft last month before ending his assignment in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although the Bush Administration originally suspended all sales to China of 
goods or technology with military applications, the Administration has since 
begun to grant waivers clearing the way for a number of important items, such 
as commercial planes and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ban on military sales "hasn't done a thing really," observed one Asian 
diplomat who keeps track of U.S. arms sales to China. "Virtually all of the 
military equipment they (U.S. officials) wanted to sell had either already gone 
or won't be ready for several years. And they will grant special exceptions for 
the rest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought to Limit Change 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration designed its response to the Tian An Men Square 
massacre to limit the extent of change in U.S. policy toward China. Indeed, in 
private, Administration officials express much less concern over the violence 
and political repression in China than over the reaction to those events by 
Congress and the American public. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official said recently that the "prevailing view" in the 
Bush White House is that American television gave a selective, unrepresentative 
portrait of events in China and that the significance of those events is being 
exaggerated. Such claims parallel closely the arguments made by the Chinese 
leadership itself since the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"Many, many more people were killed during the Cultural Revolution, at the time 
when President (Richard M.) Nixon went to China," this U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the Bush Administration's China policy is the belief that the army's 
assault on Beijing represents a short-term aberration for China and that 
Chinese leaders such as President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng will not be 
able to consolidate their control over the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Factional Struggles Possible 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect the current crowd to last more than two years," said one 
senior U.S. policy-maker. Some of the leaders eventually could be replaced 
peacefully, he said, or there could be factional struggles within the top 
leadership in which one side or another resorts to force. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Administration is hoping for changes for the better in the Chinese 
leadership, it has been trying to avoid any action against China that cannot be 
quickly undone. After the massacre last June, the Administration was careful to 
say that it was "suspending" -- rather than permanently severing -- military 
sales and high-level political contacts with China. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will act in the next few weeks on legislation that would write the 
Bush Administration's China sanctions, and possibly some additional measures, 
into law. A House-Senate conference committee will try to reconcile differences 
between bills passed separately by the two chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration probably will go along with this legislation as long as 
it contains a broad waiver allowing the President to lift sanctions against 
China whenever he thinks it would be in the "national interest" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assumptions May Prove False 
</P>
<P>
But there are some indications that the assumptions on which Bush's China 
policy is based -- that the Chinese leadership will soon take a turn for the 
better -- may be false. One Bush Administration official acknowledged that he 
is worried about what would happen if leaders such as Yang and Li consolidate 
their power and if there are further crackdowns and repression in China. 
</P>
<P>
China recently recalled most of its ambassadors from around the world to 
Beijing for top-level meetings with leaders such as new Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin. Shortly afterward, the official party-controlled Chinese 
press began to carry hints of a harder-line approach to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese officials and newspapers began to resurrect the use of the term 
"imperialism" in talking about the West. They also emphasized old themes such 
as the fundamental "struggle" between socialism and capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We should never turn a blind eye to the anti-communist and anti-socialist tide 
in the Western world, which has always existed and has risen daily in recent 
years," said the official Chinese magazine Liaowang on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Fond Dream' 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The international bourgeoisie has never given up its attempt to 
eliminate socialism. . . . The socialist system is superior to the capitalist 
system. It is but a fond dream to predict that communism will thoroughly 
collapse in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Bush Administration's effort to minimize the changes in U.S. policy 
toward China, U.S. officials acknowledge that the massacre at Tian An Men has 
had some lasting effects on ties between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, senior U.S. military officials had carried out a 
series of visits and exchanges with top-level leaders of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army. In the wake of the army's assault upon Tian An Men Square, 
these exchanges were suspended. Although some Pentagon officials are known to 
be eager to restore contacts with the army, Administration officials say this 
is unlikely to happen any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound apocalyptic, but you have to assume that the military 
relationship with the People's Republic of China, for the foreseeable future, 
is defunct," said one Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
More generally, another U.S. official observed, the events in China last June 
and afterward have so seriously damaged China's credibility that they have made 
it all but impossible for the Bush Administration to push any initiatives in 
Congress regarding China. 
</P>
<P>
At various times in the last few years, members of Congress have expressed 
concern about China's sales of arms and missiles in the Middle East, its help 
for Pakistan's nuclear-weapons program, its policies toward Hong Kong and 
Taiwan and its strict enforcement of population control. Each time, U.S. 
officials have relied on the verbal assurances of Chinese leaders that the 
regime in Beijing had decent intentions and was not engaging in irresponsible 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this U.S. official observed, the political dynamics have changed. Relying 
on the words of Chinese officials will probably not work any more. 
</P>
<P>
Each time the Bush Administration has moved to ease the impact of last June's 
sanctions against China, U.S. officials have explained that their original 
actions were being interpreted more broadly than was originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carefully Worded Sanctions 
</P>
<P>
For example, after Baker met the Chinese foreign minister and he and other top 
Administration officials saw the outgoing Chinese ambassador, U.S. officials 
said that the sanctions announced last June had been carefully worded to cover 
only formal "exchanges" in which a leader of one nation visited another. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush policy was not meant to ban all high-level contacts or meetings 
between the two nations, U.S. officials said then -- although that was the way 
the policy was interpreted last June, and Bush Administration officials did 
little to dispel that impression at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the sanctions against China were announced in very broad, general 
terms," observed Harding of the Brookings Institution. "And the Bush 
Administration has chosen to interpret them loosely, rather than strictly."

DOMESTIC ABUSE LAWS;

VICTIMS FIND LITTLE SAFETY IN SYSTEM

A Massachusetts woman asked a judge for protection from the abusive husband who 
bragged, even to police, of his plans to kill her. "This court has a lot more 
serious matters to contend with," she was told. 
</P>
<P>
In the District of Columbia, a man broke into an apartment and held the mother 
of his two children at gunpoint for hours. Prosecutors wrote the case off as a 
routine child custody spat and did not press charges. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in Colorado, terrorized for years by a former boyfriend, pleaded that 
he be held in jail. But she had only a scratch to show from his latest attack, 
and he got out with a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
These three women are now dead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killing Every Six Hours 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Nigro Dunn, Leedonyell Williams and Sharie Burge were murdered by the 
enraged, obsessed men who had been their husbands or lovers. Such killings 
occur somewhere in this country every six hours and account for almost 
one-third of women murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely do they happen without warning. Almost always, the women leave their 
stories in a police file somewhere -- one that chronicles an all too familiar 
pattern of escalating violence, one that spells out every opportunity the legal 
system had to step between the abuser and his victim. 
</P>
<P>
The system's last chance to save Maria Navarro came a week ago, when she 
telephoned the Los Angeles County sheriff's 911 emergency number and told a 
dispatcher that her estranged husband was on his way over to kill her. The 
dispatcher refused to send a patrol unit to her apartment and, half an hour 
later, a gunman killed Navarro, her two aunts and a family friend. Authorities 
later arrested Navarro's husband. 
</P>
<P>
Questions immediately arose as to whether the department properly handled the 
call. But the real issue, according to authorities and advocacy groups, is that 
the system all too often fails the desperate women who turn to it for refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"Maria Navarro did everything right, everything the system told her to do -- 
she had left the husband, she had a restraining order (that had expired), she 
called police," said Sheila James Kuehl, managing attorney for the Southern 
California Women's Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Serious State' 
</P>
<P>
"What we must learn from this is that even the threat of domestic violence is a 
very serious state," added Cheryl Ward, the senior assistant city attorney who 
chairs the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is an opportunity for authorities to intervene, they must take that 
opportunity," Ward added. "Unfortunately, when there is violence short of death 
-- threats, pushing, shoving -- it seems to get trivialized." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this apparent disregard may be that frequency has inured society 
to family violence. A University of New Hampshire study estimated that at least 
two-thirds of the 56 million married and cohabiting couples in this country 
have experienced at least one violent incident. California law enforcement 
agencies received 182,540 domestic violence calls last year. 
</P>
<P>
Women are usually at the receiving end in the worst cases -- the victims in 90% 
of the assaults and two-thirds of the domestic murders recorded by the U.S. 
Justice Department. The surgeon general in 1984 identified battering as this 
nation's single largest cause of injury to women. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the situation becomes almost unbearable will most women turn to the 
police, said Murray Straus, a sociology professor who directs the University of 
New Hampshire's Family Research Laboratory. "It takes an incredible amount of 
abuse for a woman to take legal action." 
</P>
<P>
When she does, her problems often multiply. Interviews with family counselors, 
educators, prosecutors and various police officials, as well as research 
conducted by universities and law enforcement agencies, reveal the following 
points where the system is likely to break down: 
</P>
<P>
* Despite a national trend toward arresting those who commit acts of domestic 
violence, and evidence that arrest is the best deterrent, she may encounter 
police who are reluctant to respond to her call or to treat an incident as the 
crime that it is. 
</P>
<P>
* As in any crime, if an abuser is arrested, he usually can be free in a matter 
of hours in many jurisdictions, even if he has threatened in front of police to 
kill his victim at first opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
* Easily obtained court protective orders, effective in most cases, are 
worthless against someone who is determined to hurt someone else. 
</P>
<P>
* Prosecutors and judges, swamped by other types of criminal cases, may not 
give family violence high priority. 
</P>
<P>
* Those who do pursue these cases stand a good chance of losing the victim's 
cooperation. A woman may be caught in an unhealthy dependence on her abuser, 
frightened by his threats of reprisal, swayed by his promises to reform or 
disillusioned by a confusing and intimidating court system. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, courts have granted men wide latitude in settling disputes with 
their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
In English common law, a man was considered to have a right to "physically 
chastise an errant wife." What passed for restraint was the notorious "rule of 
thumb," which stated that the stick he beat her with could not exceed the width 
of his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated Differently 
</P>
<P>
Even after domestic assaults were made illegal in the United States, a century 
ago, the system continued to treat them differently from other types of crime. 
Official policy of almost every police department was to try to reconcile the 
couple, to walk the abuser around the block until he cooled off, maybe 
recommend some counseling. 
</P>
<P>
When these cases ended up before a judge, it was usually in family court. 
</P>
<P>
"In family court, the orientation is the preservation of the family," said Mary 
Werner, an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County, N.Y. "Most of the 
time the victim gets an order of protection. Period. End of story." 
</P>
<P>
It is only recently that domestic violence has been treated as a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The case often cited as the turning point began on June 10, 1983, when Tracey 
Thurman telephoned the Torrington, Conn., police to complain that her husband 
was harassing her in violation of the protective order that was supposed to 
keep him away. 
</P>
<P>
It took 25 minutes for an officer to arrive from a nearby station, and by the 
time he did, Charles (Buck) Thurman had stabbed his wife in the face, neck and 
back. As the officer called an ambulance, he watched Thurman continue to kick 
her and grind his heavy work boot into her neck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sued Police Department 
</P>
<P>
In the first case of its kind, Tracey Thurman sued the Police Department in 
federal court and collected $2 million for the partial paralysis and other 
injuries she had suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The decision put station houses throughout the nation on notice that they could 
be held liable for their failures to stop domestic violence. Their insurance 
companies began to demand that they retrain their officers, with greater 
emphasis on intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department standards, considered among the nation's most 
progressive, were rewritten as part of a 1985 settlement of a class-action suit 
in which three women alleged that despite repeated assaults by their husbands, 
they could not get police to arrest the men. 
</P>
<P>
The women said police had argued that domestic violence was a civil, not 
criminal matter, and that a jailed husband could lose his job and the family's 
income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Signed 
</P>
<P>
The department's 7,000 officers signed an agreement to treat domestic violence 
like other battery cases -- in other words, like a felony. It is then up to 
prosecutors to determine whether a case should be pursed as a felony or a 
misdemeanor or dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, more than half the big-city police departments 
throughout the nation have established what are called a "pro-arrest policies." 
Every state but West Virginia has also adopted statutes aimed at encouraging 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
California's law, passed in 1985, requires that all sworn police officers 
receive 8 1/2 hours of training on how to handle domestic violence complaints. 
The dispatcher who answered Maria Navarro's call had been through such a 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the pressure for more arrests was an experiment conducted in 
Minneapolis for the U.S. Justice Department in 1981 and 1982. Researchers 
discovered that suspects who were arrested were only half as likely to repeat 
the offense as those who were simply counseled or taken away from the scene. 
Arrest appeared to be a strong deterrent, even though only a handful of people 
who were hauled in ever spent as much as one night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrests Have Skyrocketed 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is the fact that wife-beating is against the law," said Richard 
Berk, a UCLA sociology professor who co-wrote the study. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies nationwide say the number of domestic violence arrests 
has skyrocketed as the result of new pro-arrest requirements. Los Angeles saw a 
sevenfold rise in domestic violence arrests when it began its policy four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes take longer to change. 
</P>
<P>
Even in communities where there is an official pro-arrest stance, many say 
police do not treat domestic violence with the same urgency accorded when the 
assailant is a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, the way to get a quick and effective police response is to tell 
them, 'There's a man in my house with a knife.' If you say, 'It's my husband,' 
you get an entirely different response, with a lower priority," said Joan 
Meier, a Washington attorney who is on the legal committee of the D.C. 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Swamped' 
</P>
<P>
A torrent of domestic violence arrests is adding to the burden of overloaded 
jails and courtrooms. "We're swamped," Suffolk County's Werner said. "We cannot 
give the time and effort and the person power that we want to the prosecution 
of these cases." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some Los Angeles prosecutors have been openly resentful at having 
to spend time on what they see as frivolous cases arising from the city's 
pro-arrest policy. One, who asked to remain anonymous, did not disguise his 
scorn as he showed the evidence from a case to a Times reporter in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this, a scratch on the stomach," he told the reporter. "What am I 
doing with this? They (the police) know better." 
</P>
<P>
Judges, too, have been known to express low regard for the domestic cases that 
have crowded their docket. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Massachusetts Judge Paul H. King was disciplined, in part because he 
was rude and insensitive to battered women whose cases were heard in his 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe she was beaten. I didn't see any bruises. Most women bruise 
pretty easily," King once said of a victim, even though her story was verified 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
King asked another woman, "What did you do to make him hit you?" 
</P>
<P>
Today, King remains on the bench and last April he was named Man of the Year by 
the Quincy Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unwilling Judges 
</P>
<P>
With jails already full of dangerous criminals, judges often are unwilling to 
hold wife beaters there for long. Further, in New York and many other states, 
the law prohibits them from taking a family's safety fears into account when 
setting bail. The amount is based instead on ensuring that a suspect will 
return for his next court date. 
</P>
<P>
If he appears to have roots that will hold him in the community -- a job, a 
house -- the arrested man is likely to be released on his own recognizance, 
often to return to the home he shares with the woman he abuses. 
</P>
<P>
In California, it is left up to the judges to consider public safety issues 
when setting bail. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been innumerable times when a judge has refused to hear my 
information that this man is a threat to his family and should have a higher 
bail," said Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Alana Bowman, who heads the agency's 
domestic violence prosecution unit. 
</P>
<P>
Experience had taught Lisa Bianco everything she should do to protect herself. 
After she got her ex-husband sentenced to five years in prison for his years of 
abuse, she counseled others at the battered women's shelter in Elkhart, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Threats 
</P>
<P>
He oftened phoned her from prison to tell her what he planned to do to her when 
he got out, and each time, Bianco would report it to prison officials. They 
agreed to inform her if he ever got out, even on a short furlough. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't. When Alan Matheney got an eight-hour pass last March, he headed 
straight for Bianco's house 150 miles away. He is to stand trial in November on 
charges of bludgeoning her to death on her front sidewalk with the butt of a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh has agreed to a $900,000 settlement to be paid her 
estate and her two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Christy Doheny is afraid that the same thing may happen to her. Her former 
boyfriend, Anthony Young, is to be released soon from a Connecticut prison 
where he is serving time for burglary and for beating and choking her. 
</P>
<P>
Young has written her more than 45 threatening letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet you this time here I kill you," he wrote in one note, quoted in a 
front-page story by the New Haven Register. He also has mailed her pictures of 
their daughter with her eyes poked out and mutilated copies of the court order 
that ostensibly bars him from contacting her. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, the protective orders work really well -- I would say 80 to 
90%," said Robin Murphy, head of the New Haven Legal Assistance family-child 
unit, which is working on Doheny's case. "But in the other 10% of the cases, 
the restraining orders mean nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the space of nine days last December and January, three Long Island 
women holding protective orders were killed by their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say one of their biggest problems is that victims themselves often 
are unwilling to cooperate in prosecuting those who batter them. 
</P>
<P>
For example, police say that in fully half of their Suffolk County domestic 
violence calls, the victim does not want her attacker arrested. In misdemeanor 
cases, this means police must let him go. 
</P>
<P>
Of those victims who do allow arrest, another half change their minds by the 
time the case gets to court. 
</P>
<P>
Suffolk County's Werner blames this on the unhealthy dependence that many 
victims, their self-esteem and confidence battered out of them, have on their 
abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman is someone who married this man, who loves him. She's had children 
with him," Werner said. "She depends on this battering man for every 
satisfaction in her life -- for social support, for financial support, for 
emotional support." 
</P>
<P>
Because of these strong attachments, many women become caught up in cycles of 
escalating violence. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern begins with what counselors call the "battering incident," which is 
followed by a "honeymoon phase," a time of reconciliation when the victim 
denies her troubles and hopes for better times. Tensions then rise again until 
another beating takes place. 
</P>
<P>
"The cycle can continue for years to the point where victims are being 
stalked," said Barbara Kendall, director of the Victim Witness unit of the 
Boulder County district attorney's office in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
They also grow disillusioned with the disjointed and intimidating justice 
system, others say. In Los Angeles, for example, a woman may have to take her 
case to Juvenile Dependency Court, Family Law Court and criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman will have to appear in three different places and tell the same 
story over and over. . . . It's a mess," said Sheila James Kuehl of the 
Southern California Women's Law Center. She and others advocate establishing a 
single domestic court to handle all such cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 California law gave law enforcement officers the ability to arrest 
domestic violence suspects even when the victim refuses to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that it is important to take batterers into custody, even without 
the consent of their victims, because this will impress upon them that their 
actions are a crime, even if they are never put in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"A good arrest does not have to lead to a conviction. A good arrest leads to a 
change in behavior," said Edmund Stubbing, an ex-New York City police officer 
who now works for the nonprofit Victim Services Agency and organizes seminars 
to help police executives set up pro-arrest systems. 
</P>
<P>
Other agencies are taking pro-arrest policies one step further -- to 
"pro-prosecution." San Diego is considered to have perhaps the most aggressive 
pro-prosecution efforts in California, taking about 1,400 misdemeanor spousal 
abuse cases to court each year. 
</P>
<P>
"About 80% of the cases involved victims who did not want us to prosecute," 
said Casey Gwinn, a deputy city attorney in charge of San Diego's domestic 
violence unit. "But society only recently is beginning to treat domestic 
violence like any other crime. We never ask an armed robbery victim if she 
wants to prosecute. We just prosecute. Why should it be any different in 
domestic violence cases?" 
</P>
<P>
When battering is still at the misdemeanor stage -- pushing, shoving, bruising 
-- the legal system has its best chance of changing an abuser's behavior, Gwinn 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study of Abusers 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 San Diego study tracked 200 misdemeanor abusers who were sentenced to 
one year of weekly counseling sessions. None of the 72% completing the class 
were rearrested within the next year. But nearly half of those who dropped out 
were. 
</P>
<P>
Officials worry, however, that highly publicized tragedies such as Navarro's 
slaying will make women even more fearful of calling for help or leaving their 
husbands or boyfriends. Often, they say, a husband will show his wife a news 
clipping of such an incident and warn her that she could be next. 
</P>
<P>
"The wrong message gets out," Werner said. "There is hope. 
</P>
<P>
"God, we have to believe that."

It is after midnight in the emergency room at Martin Luther King Jr. / Drew 
Medical Center, and young doctors and nurses are scrambling to treat the 
night's onslaught of sick and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The evening has brought an 11-year-old boy with a shotgun wound to the head and 
his 18-year-old friend, whose arm was partially blown off by another blast. 
There is also a 14-year-old youth whose calf was mangled by a pit bull. And 
languishing on a gurney in the hallway is a man whose leg was caught in a power 
lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
Four adults are waiting for intensive care beds, which are full. One patient -- 
unconscious and hooked to a ventilator -- has been lingering in the emergency 
room for three days. 
</P>
<P>
But amid all the activity, the senior attending physician on duty is nowhere in 
sight. Although he is supposed to be supervising, tonight he is in a private 
room equipped with a bed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuses Interview 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter knocks about 2 a.m., he comes to the door stretching and 
yawning and declines to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for senior physicians to sleep on the job or otherwise 
ignore their supervisory responsibilities in King's busy emergency department, 
say many of the young resident doctors who come to the 430-bed, county-owned 
teaching hospital in Watts to complete their final training after finishing 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"Look around," says Dr. Bernie Clum, a resident in training in the emergency 
room. "There are no attending (senior physicians) in this emergency room. The 
attendings are here in theory only. They come for rounds and go retire in their 
room and go to sleep, come back (in the morning) and sign off on the charts." 
</P>
<P>
Close supervision of the emergency room is supposed to be provided by a corps 
of full-time senior attending doctors on the staff of the hospital. Eight of 
the 11 attending physicians -- who are paid between $79,000 and $119,000 a year 
-- have jobs outside the hospital, according to interviews and records obtained 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's medical director, Dr. James Haughton III, said he discovered 
last fall that "a whole bunch" of attending physicians were working far fewer 
hours at King than they were being paid for. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Theodore Schlater, acting chief of emergency medicine, defended his staff 
as hard workers and diligent supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
As for charges that some of them sleep on the job, Dr. Schlater said, "I don't 
think there's anybody who spends the majority of time in the bed. . . . I'd be 
the last to say 'never,' but when they (the residents) apply (that to) the 
majority (of attending doctors), that's baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not all the same," said one attending emergency physician, Dr. Caspar 
Glenn. "I put in my 40 hours (a week) plus more. . . . When I do work at night, 
typically I do not sleep and usually the bed is unslept in. . . . There may be 
perhaps one or two people who don't do what the residents (young doctors) think 
they should . . . but the majority of individuals are doing what they are 
supposed to be doing." However, Dr. Charles Whiteman, who graduated with top 
honors last year as the chief resident in emergency medicine, said of the 
attending physicians: 
</P>
<P>
"At night, they're back watching "Nightline" or something else on TV or asleep. 
In the daytime . . . they have to be a little more visible because 
administrators are walking around. But they're definitely not supervising the 
residents or providing patient care." 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the worst things here," said Dr. Ken Saunders, another resident. 
"That's not true of other hospitals. Other places, they (attending physicians) 
are over your shoulder, involved, interested, giving advice." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of supervision may be symptomatic of a department that has long 
drifted leaderless. For more than seven years, emergency medicine has lacked a 
permanent chairman, something that Haughton, the medical director, acknowledged 
is "crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Haughton said he has gone into the emergency room at all different hours and "I 
don't see the attending (physicians) doing a lot of patient care." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, he discovered last fall that some of them were putting in far 
fewer hours at King than the 160 hours a month they are paid to work there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this whole bunch of guys putting in . . . not even . . . 100 hours a 
month," Haughton said he discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Haughton confronted the physicians about what he viewed as their "dereliction 
of duty" at a meeting on Sept. 28 that, he said, got "a little hot." 
</P>
<P>
"The response I get is: 'This is the way it's been. This is the understanding,' 
" Haughton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We separated friends, with the agreement that things are going to change." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Haughton said he laid down a rule last September requiring 
that two attending physicians be present to supervise the emergency room during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his efforts to require more participation from them, The Times 
monitored the activities of several full-time attending physicians and 
discovered that: 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. John A. Williams reported working a full day at Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts on Nov. 18, 1988. He reported on his time card 
that he arrived at the hospital at 8 a.m. and checked out at 5:30 p.m. But a 
Times reporter and photographer who followed him that day found that Williams 
actually spent less than four hours at the medical center. He arrived at King 
about 8:40 a.m. He left at 12:08 p.m., and did not return. Instead, he ran 
errands and visited other hospitals where he treats private patients. He 
declined repeated requests for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Gary Ordog was scheduled to work as one of two attending physicians in 
the emergency room during the day on Dec. 8, 1988, but he wasn't there. 
Instead, he was 40 miles away working at the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia. Ordog works in the Valencia hospital's emergency room 
even though he reported on a disclosure statement, which he was required to 
file with his supervisors, that he has no employment other than at King. Ordog 
said in an interview that he took compensatory time off from King on Dec. 8 and 
arranged for a colleague to cover for him at King while he worked at Henry 
Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Glenn was scheduled to work as one of two attending physicians in the 
emergency room during the day on Jan. 27 -- such a busy day that by 11 a.m. the 
hospital was closed to ambulance traffic. But Glenn was not there. He 
acknowledged in an interview that he was home, recovering from having worked 
all night at another hospital, the Dominguez Valley Medical Center. Although 
Glenn was working there regularly, he did not report that he held this outside 
job on a disclosure form he filed with his supervisors at King. In an 
interview, Glenn said he did not think he was required to be on the premises 
Jan. 27. "The bottom line," Glenn said, "is that I don't think that anybody who 
knows me would question that I put in 40 hours a week, plus." Glenn added that 
there are "probably one or two people who abuse the system" in the department 
of emergency medicine, but he said that he is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike King, some teaching hospitals flatly prohibit their full-time salaried 
physicians from engaging in private practice. The theory is that outside work 
tends to distract physicians from their obligations to supervise residents, 
conduct research, publish treatises, write grant proposals, and provide 
hands-on patient care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
But teaching hospitals that prohibit outside employment -- like UCLA Medical 
Center and UC San Francisco -- usually provide better financial opportunities 
for their doctors than are provided at King. Among other things, salaries are 
higher and research opportunities are vast. Also, doctors are usually given 
ample opportunity to treat private patients and bill separately for their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition that the salaries paid doctors at county-owned hospitals are 
lower than what the physicians could probably earn in private practice, 
full-time doctors employed by Los Angeles County are permitted to hold outside 
jobs up to 24 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
However, under threat of disciplinary action or dismissal, the county requires 
doctors to obtain prior written approval from their supervisors for their 
outside work. 
</P>
<P>
For years, these requirements have gone largely unenforced at King. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody forgot" to ask doctors to file disclosure forms reporting their 
outside jobs, said hospital administrator Williams Delgardo. He said he 
directed doctors to fill them out after The Times asked to see them last year. 
</P>
<P>
A review of these disclosure forms shows that full-time attending physicians in 
all sections of the hospital are engaged in private practice. In some cases the 
outside work appears to be quite demanding. One full-time surgeon at King, for 
example, noted that his private practice consumes as much as 40 hours a week of 
his time. 
</P>
<P>
While he was holding the job of full-time chief of cardiology at King, Dr. Ravi 
Prakash filed a disclosure form stating that he had an outside private practice 
in Torrance, but that it required only three hours' work on Saturdays. But he 
has apparently been working at his private practice during the week, too. A 
reporter found him there on Wednesday afternoon, Jan. 25, with a waiting room 
full of patients. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Prakash has been promoted to chief of internal medicine. But in 
August, the department's senior attending doctors sent him a memorandum 
expressing a "vote of no confidence" in his leadership because of his frequent 
absences from the department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Talk to Reporters 
</P>
<P>
Prakash defended his leadership in a memorandum and explained that school 
business sometimes takes him off campus. He has repeatedly refused to be 
interviewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, doctors at King have filed disclosure forms swearing that they 
had no outside employment when, in fact, they do, The Times found. For example, 
Dr. Schlater, acting chief of the department of emergency medicine, admitted in 
an interview that he did not disclose that he works part time at Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. Asked why, he said: "I thought that was so 
small that it wasn't even worth mentioning." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Grand Jury, investigating administrative functioning at 
King in 1987, received testimony from one King physician that many full-time 
doctors at King "have private offices and busy practices during weekday 
afternoons. The surgical staff, in particular, are notorious for their large 
outside private practices." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Haughton acknowledged that the prevalence of off-site private practice 
among King's 130 attending physicians is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Your private practice should not become your primary practice, but how do you 
draw the line?" Haughton asked. 
</P>
<P>
He cited an instance where surgery had to be canceled because the senior 
attending surgeon, whom he did not identify, failed to show up to supervise the 
operation. It turned out he had an emergency in his private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't come in and he didn't arrange for somebody else to cover for him," 
Haughton said. "That's just not acceptable." In an interview, Dr. Arthur 
Fleming, King's chief of trauma and surgery, defended King's senior surgeons as 
"a uniquely capable faculty for this institution." And he said that to his 
knowledge their private practices have never interfered with surgery at King. 
</P>
<P>
But in a memo he wrote in April 11, 1985, that was published in a book entitled 
"A Century of Black Surgeons," Fleming acknowledged that the department of 
surgery at King was suffering from "a negative image throughout the 
institution" because of the widely held perception that attending surgeons are 
"not available when needed" and are extensively involved in private practice, 
with little commitment to King. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ask from my fellow surgeons," he said in the memo "is that they be 
accountable for what they do by reporting accurately the hours worked and the 
money earned. The Department of Surgery will continuously be accused of working 
only two to four hours at King-Drew Medical Center each day and making lots of 
money on the outside unless we become fully accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harvie Dale Harrier, an attending surgeon at King who does not work 
anywhere else, said there is a "great temptation" for doctors who have off-site 
private practices to develop their businesses at the expense of their county 
obligations. He said that doctors with outside jobs "have conflicts of interest 
built in." 
</P>
<P>
"My problem," said Haughton, "is making an assessment of the extent to which 
their having a private practice may interfere with their duties here. . . . 
It's sort of an honor system." 
</P>
<P>
County auditors have long warned of lax timekeeping practices at King. 
</P>
<P>
They have reported that physicians signed blank time cards that were filled out 
by clerical staff who never verified that the hours billed were actually 
worked. Some medical departments permitted doctors to bill for 24 hours of 
service on days when they were on call but not on the premises. And frequently 
the total hours billed did not correspond to the number of hours marked as 
"time in" and "time out." 
</P>
<P>
A management audit in 1987 by the private accounting firm of Touche Ross 
recommended that the medical center "immediately design and implement improved 
procedures for physician time-reporting and monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
King officials have told county auditors that they have done so. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, King set up a so-called "faculty practice plan" that hospital 
officials hope will eventually allow physicians to supplement their salaries by 
treating private patients at King and billing separately for their care. 
</P>
<P>
Haughton described the program as part of an effort to "pull them (the doctors) 
back to campus." 
</P>
<P>
Other county hospitals implemented such plans years ago. At Harbor 
General/UCLA, Haughton pointed out, the plan has significantly reduced the need 
for attending physicians to engage in off-site private practice. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be some time before the plan gets off the ground at King. 
Meanwhile, physicians are continuing to go off-campus to set up private 
practices to supplement their incomes.

GERMAN UNITY COULD BE NEAR, U.S. ENVOY SAYS

<P>
U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters declared Sunday that the current flight of 
East Germans to the West indicates that East and West Germany might be united 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that a senior allied diplomat has spoken of the 
possibility of German reunification in the short term -- rather than in the 
distant future. 
</P>
<P>
And it underscored a new feeling among West German analysts that the exodus of 
East Germans from the Communist state, and the illness of East German leader 
Erich Honecker, might lead to dramatic changes in the East Berlin regime sooner 
rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in German by West German radio, Walters was asked whether he could 
"foresee a united Germany in the near future," and the veteran American 
diplomat answered: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not normal with two Germanies," added the 72-year-old Walters. "We must 
live with realities. We have an embassy in East Germany. But I believe that 
this stream of people coming out shows that Germans are concerned about the 
division." 
</P>
<P>
About 90,000 East Germans are expected to obtain legal visas to leave the 
Communist state this year. Many of them are young and in their most productive 
working years. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 more have fled from East Germany by way of Hungary since May when 
the Budapest regime began dismantling fences along its border with Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, several thousand East Germans are in Hungary awaiting a possible 
deal between Bonn and Budapest that would allow them to emigrate to West 
Germany via Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian diplomats were in East Berlin last week reportedly seeking East 
Germany's approval for Budapest to let the East Germans leave, in what is said 
to be a one-of-a-kind deal. 
</P>
<P>
While it has been the policy of the United States and its European allies to 
support eventual German reunification, most Western officials have privately 
been chary about seeing a massive, reunited Germany in the middle of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'German Question' 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the past the "German question" -- reunification -- has been kept on 
the diplomatic back burner in order not to arouse hopes and passions on both 
sides of the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, senior officials such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl believed that 
reunification was a distant goal, but now with the influx of East Germans, Kohl 
and others have been urged to make contingency plans for rapid developments in 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks Sunday, Walters said, "President Bush has said that we are for 
such a development, if it were to be achieved peacefully and through free 
elections by the population." 
</P>
<P>
Walters, who took up his post here in April, said that Eastern Europe could be 
helped by a new Marshall-type plan, with financial credits earmarked for 
specific projects that would aid the economies of East Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat made his remarks on the same day that East Germany opened 
its semi-annual Trade Fair in Leipzig, where the top West German official based 
in East Berlin, Franz Bertele, declared bluntly of the massive exodus: "The 
problems started in the DDR (East Germany), and they must be solved here too." 
</P>
<P>
The East German regime, which has resisted Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's call for reform and liberalization, seems at a loss to devise a 
workable policy to keep its young citizens from fleeing to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, at 77, is recuperating from a mysterious operation on his gall 
bladder, and the East German leader did not make a scheduled appearance in 
Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was represented by Prime Minister Willi Stoph, 75, who replied to 
Bertele's remarks by declaring that East and West Germany must "proceed by 
mutually respecting sovereignty and without interfering in internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
The Leipzig fair is the showcase for East German products and a major source of 
foreign exchange from the business deals that are signed there. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 116 East Germans have sought refuge in the West German mission 
compound in East Berlin, hoping to get accelerated permission to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Others are in the West German embassies in Budapest and Prague waiting for the 
chance to head to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many of the East Germans vacationing in Hungary and other Eastern 
European countries are due back at work and school. Some authorities in 
Budapest believe there will be a rush for the Austrian border if word comes 
that the frontier will be opened this week.

Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi has decided to cut off or trim the flow of funds 
to some liberation and terrorist groups, Western and Palestinian sources said. 
The sources, in Tripoli over the weekend for ceremonies marking the 20th 
anniversary of the coup that brought Kadafi to power, said he has told several 
Palestinian groups that they will no longer receive direct funding from his 
government and that they should close their offices in Libya. If the reports 
are true, the action would reflect what appears to be Kadafi's efforts to 
improve his image in the West and reduce Libya's isolation.

Toxic chemicals found within half a mile of Anderson Reservoir outside San 
Jose, which provides water for one-fourth of Santa Clara County, will be 
cleaned up at a cost of $20 million by United Technologies Corp., a 
rocket-motor company. The firm was ordered last January to clean up the area by 
October, 1990, after the solvents trichloroethylene, or TCE, trichloroethane 
and freon were found in the ground near the company's facility. The sites had 
been used to dispose of toxic chemicals for three decades before dumping was 
banned. The reservoir supplies drinking water for 300,000 people.

A pilot and his passenger were found dead Sunday underneath the wreckage of a 
small plane that crashed near Koehn Lake in the Mojave Desert, authorities 
said. An air ambulance helicopter was used to lift the wreckage of the Long EZ, 
a type of home-built airplane, from deep mud near the dry lake, east of Red 
Rock Canyon State Park in the desert northeast of Los Angeles. The crash was 
thought to have occurred Saturday evening, said Kern County Senior Deputy 
Sheriff Richard Dixon.

AUSCHWITZ PACT SUPPORTED

Three of the four Roman Catholic cardinals who signed an agreement with Jewish 
leaders to move a Carmelite convent away from the Auschwitz death camp in 
Poland said the pact must be carried out. In a statement issued in Paris, the 
three clerics said that Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the primate of Poland, "could 
only have been speaking for himself" -- not for the church -- in suggesting a 
renegotiation of the accord. Glemp was quoted on Saturday as saying it would be 
"a scandal" to move the convent under the 1987 agreement. The new statement was 
issued by Cardinals Godfried Danneels of Brussels, Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris 
and Albert Decourtray of Lyon, France. The fourth cardinal was Franciszek 
Macharski of Krakow, Poland.

A short, sharp earthquake jolted the wine country about 65 miles north of San 
Francisco on Sunday but caused no damage or injuries, authorities said. The 
temblor, which occurred at 8:24 a.m., measured 3.2 in intensity and was 
centered seven miles east of Cloverdale and 10 miles north of Healdsburg, 
according to the the National Geological Survey in Menlo Park. It occurred in 
the geothermal fields known as The Geysers. Dozens of Sonoma County residents 
called local authorities to report the quake.

The number of police officers killed on drug-related duty reached an all-time 
high in 1988, the Washington-based Crime Control Institute said. The group's 
study found that 14 officers died in drug raids and arrests and in serving 
warrants, including one who was assassinated in New York. It said such killings 
have averaged seven a year since 1972, when the FBI began analyzing on-duty 
police deaths, and the proportion attributable to drug-related crime was 18% in 
1988, up from 6% in 1985. Lawrence W. Sherman, the University of Maryland 
professor who heads the institute, said that stepped-up anti-drug efforts 
influenced the figures.

The Afghan government denied there are any Soviet military advisers working 
with its troops, despite U.S. assertions to the contrary. "There is no Soviet 
military adviser in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan armed forces enjoy sufficient 
experience and morale to defend the country," a Foreign Ministry statement 
said. Peter Tomsen, the U.S. envoy to the Afghan rebel government based in 
Pakistan, said last week that at least 300 Soviet advisers were helping the 
Kabul regime. He also said Washington will continue to provide military 
assistance to all rebel groups. The Afghan statement criticized this U.S. aid 
pledge, saying it "indicates the instability of the moujahedeen (rebel) 
government and the U.S. lack of confidence in that government."

WOOD SPILL ON HIGHWAY TURNED MOTORCYCLE OUTING INTO DISASTER 
</P>

Cords of firewood that spilled from a flatbed truck aggravated the fiery crash 
that killed five motorcyclists participating in an annual Labor Day weekend 
trip in the Sierra Nevada, the California Highway Patrol said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the load spilled after the driver of the truck crossed into an 
oncoming lane and into the path of dozens of bikers. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, his passenger and a sixth motorcyclist were seriously injured in 
the crash on the so-called Mormon Emigrant Trail, a mountain road about five 
miles south of Sly Park in El Dorado County. 
</P>
<P>
The back roads of the Sierra Nevada forest land are the scene of an annual trek 
that attracts hundreds of cycling enthusiasts from around the West. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said the victims in Saturday's accident had been biking to the area for 
10 years and were en route to a campsite in the Hope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Over the first 36 hours of the Labor Day weekend, 40 traffic fatalities were 
reported in California, including a highway patrolman who burned to death in 
San Francisco when his car was rear-ended by a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Hugo Olazar, 35, died inside the patrol car, which was parked on the 
shoulder of the freeway late Saturday night so he could investigate a previous 
collision in which no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup, Jorge Perez of Daly City, was arrested on suspicion 
of felony driving under the influence of alcohol and vehicular manslaughter. 
Perez was in stable condition at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sierra Nevada incident, investigators were still trying to determine 
whether the motorcyclists were hit by the wood or crashed into it, and at what 
point the bikes and truck collided. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, for some unknown reason, (the driver) crossed over the line and 
lost control, causing (a panel) that held the wood to break," CHP spokeswoman 
Mary Ann Biggs said. "Wood went all over the roadway. The cycles went down 
(and) then there was a fire at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck was identified as Daniel DeWater, 24, of Shingle 
Springs. He was listed in serious condition at the University Medical Center in 
Sacramento. His passenger, Wanda Robertson, 32, was in very critical condition 
with burns over 90% of her body, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in the accident, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth cyclist was Fritz-Howard Clapp, 43, a Sacramento attorney. He was in 
critical condition with burns over 60% of his body, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Douglas J. Wall, 24, of Reno; Jeffrey H. Sund, 32, El Dorado; 
Debbie M. Sund, 32, El Dorado; Jeffrey A. Pearl, 41, Foster City, and James D. 
Carter, 35, Sacramento, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Remains Hospitalized 
</P>
<P>
Two other people were treated at the Marshall Hospital in Placerville; one 
remained hospitalized Sunday for observation and the other was released. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described a crash scene in which bodies were strewn along the 
two-lane highway and motorcycles lay crushed underneath the truck. The accident 
closed the road as rescuers worked to douse the fire and recover victims. 
</P>
<P>
Two ambulances, two helicopters, a local fire department, the Forest Service 
and CHP vehicles rushed to the scene, about five miles east of Jenkinson 
Reservoir south of U.S. 50. 
</P>
<P>
"There were just victims scattered up and down the road," John Walshaw, chief 
of the Pollock Pines-Camino Fire Protection District, told local reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors stood by, Walshaw said. "They were hugging and crying."

A twin-engine commuter plane was hit by a bullet Sunday while on final approach 
to Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport, the Broward County Sheriff's 
Office said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Edward Clark Wright, 42, of Dove Canyon, Calif., was grazed by the 
bullet, which authorities believe was fired from the ground. Wright was treated 
for a superficial scalp wound at Broward General Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet was recovered but a search for the gunman continued Sunday night, 
Jim Leljedal, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly an isolated incident. It could have been an accident," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
USAir Flight 4343 from Eleuthera and Governors Harbour in the Bahamas was 
flying at less than 1,000 feet on final approach with the landing gear down 
when the bullet hit the plane. The twin-engine turbo prop Hinson commuter plane 
was carrying 16 passengers and three crew members.

AMERICAN ALBUM: IN ONE SMALL TOWN, THE HUMAN CONDITION IS ETCHED IN STONE.

<P>
In a placid field off Highway 77 stand six giant slabs of granite, at once 
mysterious and imposing, marked by engraved messages. 
</P>
<P>
Erected in 1980 with stone from a local quarry and paid for by a stranger known 
only by the pseudonym Robert C. Christian, the structure draws visitors from 
around the world who gaze and read aloud from the inscriptions written in eight 
languages, dealing with improvement of the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stonehenge in Britian, the mass of stone inspires awe and speculation. Why 
was it built? And who is Christian, really? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Town on Map 
</P>
<P>
Some people describe the assembly, called the Georgia Guidestones, as a force 
for good, while others believe it is a tool for the devil's work. Amid this 
debate, there is one certainty: The Guidestones, a monument of granite, also 
are a monument to granite. And they are putting Elberton on the map. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Interior Department's Bureau of Mines, Georgia produces 
166,000 tons of granite a year, about twice as much as Vermont, its nearest 
U.S. competitor. Elberton, Georgia's leading producer, modestly proclaims 
itself to be the Granite Capital of the World. 
</P>
<P>
The town of 7,200 has 40 granite quarries, a granite museum, the requisite 
granite memorial to the Confederacy, a Granite City Bank, and a 20,000-seat 
football stadium called the Granite Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Guidestones came along, Elberton was on a roll. It annually 
rakes in $100 million from the sale of 200,000 or more gravestones, monuments 
and other memorials, including a sizable export business of raw granite to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fendley, chairman of the board of the Elberton Granite Finishing Co. and 
mayor of Elberton from 1980 to 1987, said his firm exported "in the seven 
figures" to Japan last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the mysterious "Mr. Christian" paid Fendley "six figures" to build the 
Guidestones. 
</P>
<P>
Fendley recalls being skeptical when the neatly dressed, soft-spoken Christian 
came to his office wanting "to buy a monument." After Christian described the 
project, Fendley says his first thought was "I either got a kook on my hands or 
I got somebody with a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some misgivings -- Christian insisted on anonymity and is still known 
only to Fendley and a local banker who processed the check -- Fendley took the 
job. He used 28-ton chunks of granite to create each of the six slabs and 
erected them on the highest spot in the county, a small piece of farm land 
purchased from 40 acres belonging to Wayne and Mildred Mullenix. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the stones form a giant flywheel pattern around a center stone and a 
capstone. At a height of 19 feet, weighing about 119 tons each, they contain 
holes and slits angled to locate the North Star and mark high noon and the 
summer and winter solstices with spots of sunlight. Thus, the stones could 
"restart" the world's compasses, clocks and calendars in the event of a nuclear 
holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Messages in 8 Languages 
</P>
<P>
Ten messages, called Guiding Thoughts, appear on the four main stones in 
English, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Swahili, Hindi and Spanish. 
A sentence -- "Let these be Guidestones to an Age of Reason" -- is carved on 
the capstone in four archaic languages: Sanskrit, Babylonian cuneiform, 
classical Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
The messages urge humanity to come up with a single language, to resolve 
external disputes in a world court, to "avoid petty laws and useless officials" 
and to "be not a cancer on Earth -- leave room for nature," among other 
admonitions. 
</P>
<P>
The site is said to be at the spiritual center of the Cherokee Nation, and 
during construction, workers reported hearing strange music and voices. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard preachers say it's evil," said Hudson Cone of the Elberton Granite 
Assn., "and I've heard people say it's the holiest spot on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poison Letters' 
</P>
<P>
Fendley said, "I got a lot of poison calls and poison letters" over the years. 
Many of his detractors accuse him of concocting a scheme for 
self-aggrandizement, and inventing the character of Mr. Christian. Fendly 
denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever he is, Christian specified that the site remain "natural." Not much has 
been done to make the site accessible. It has no parking lot, and the adjoining 
road is narrow. Nevertheless, thousands have made the trek to the old Mullenix 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Naunie Batchelder, a psychic counselor in Atlanta, was married at the stones -- 
between the Russian and English messages, she says. While the marriage ended in 
divorce, Batchelder maintains that "there is a special energy there, a healing 
energy. Granite magnifies it." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Clark, a college sophomore, said the stones have "stirred up a lot of 
talk about devil worship. My brother actually saw cars out there at midnight." 
Friday the 13th, he said, is a particularly active night. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Mullenix recalls seeing "a clan of people camped out there. I call that 
odd, just to be camped out there in the middle of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
As for mystic powers, she said, "It hasn't affected me that way," despite her 
home's nearness to the stones. 
</P>
<P>
But the mass has proved useful. "We use it as a reference point in directing 
people to our house," she said.

EXILED CHINESE REFORMER URGES OUSTER OF HARD-LINERS

<P>
One of the leading figures in China's economic-reform movement emerged from 
three months of hiding Sunday to call for an international campaign to bring 
down the government officials who ordered the June massacre of demonstrators in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Yizi, an influential adviser to deposed leader Zhao Ziyang, said that 
hard-line forces in the Chinese government had provoked the June 3-4 military 
action against student demonstrators as a way of gaining control over the 
divided Communist regime and putting an end to Zhao's reform program, which 
sought to change China's socialist, centralized economy to one that responds to 
market forces. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is the most senior Chinese official known to have escaped to the West 
from Beijing and the campaign of executions, arrests and national political 
intimidation that began after the army assault, spoke in a four-hour interview, 
the first he has given. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the popular student-led demonstrations for democracy last spring 
brought to a head a two-year-old power struggle within the Politburo over the 
future of reform. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners, led by Prime Minister Li Peng and party elder Chen Yun, began 
to demand military action against the demonstrators in late April but were 
resisted by Zhao until a climactic Politburo meeting on May 17, when Zhao was 
forced to resign as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, according 
to the account offered Sunday by Chen Yizi. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, 49, said he had learned about that time that China's much-feared Public 
Security Bureau had placed him on a list as a "counterrevolutionary" and that 
someone had started to follow him. With the help of friends, he left Beijing on 
June 5. He would provide no details of his escape, of how he came to France or 
of where he has been for the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, Chen headed China's Institute for Economic Structural 
Reform, one of three influential think tanks Zhao established in Beijing. The 
institutes developed and guided the ground-breaking reforms that introduced 
market incentives in light industry and agriculture, bringing significant 
increases in per capita income to China's peasants and many factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chen worked closely with Zhao, who is reported to be under house arrest, and 
with Bao Tong, a senior reform official who was jailed May 28. At least 14 
members of Chen's institute have been reported by Chinese exiles to have been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Concern for his own safety and that of his associates still in China appears to 
have caused Chen to wait until now to reveal publicly that he had escaped to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has tape-recorded more than 100 hours of discussion on sensitive 
matters "of recent history" that would be released by supporters if anything 
happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
The Front for a Democratic China that he is organizing will be headquartered in 
Paris and will appeal for support from Chinese exiles and overseas Chinese, he 
said. 
</P>

"We would have liked to have the organization in the United States," said Chen, 
whose remarks were interpreted from Chinese. "But the United States government 
has appeared to be reluctant to grant visas to dissidents and to help us be 
effective politically, while France has been very helpful. The attitude of the 
Bush Administration has been disappointing when you compare it to the support 
and sympathy we receive from Congress." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush imposed limited sanctions on China to protest the crackdown on 
dissent. Chen said that if the United States "eases its sanctions against 
China, that is oxygen for Li Peng's government, and a bad investment for 
America because Li Peng's government cannot last long. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that strengthens the central government is bad," Chen said.

TINY PANDA DIES; HOPES FOR ANOTHER BIRTH AT ZOO FADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Despite medical care that matched the best efforts to save a premature human 
baby, a tiny, sickly panda cub died at the National Zoo early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the little cub also cast serious doubt on the likelihood that a 
giant panda will ever be raised in a U.S. zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Ling-Ling, the one female panda given by Chinese officials to the United States 
in 1972, is now 20 years old and has lost all five cubs born at the zoo. Her 
pregnancy this year was considered remarkable in itself because no other panda 
of her age had been known to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are very lucky, she may breed at 21 years of age," a disappointed zoo 
director Michael Robinson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medical Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians who worked for 40 hours to save the little cub said he died of an 
infection contracted from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.1-ounce cub, smaller than a stick of butter, was put in an oxygen-filled 
incubator, administered antibiotics and fed liquids through a tube. The tiny 
cub rallied briefly on Saturday, but finally died of the infection before 1 
a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The chief culprit appears to be a recurring urinary tract infection in the 
mother panda, Dr. Mitchell Bush, the zoo's chief veterinarian, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a newborn cub nearly twice as large as this year's offspring 
lived four days but died of an infection. Since then, zoo officials have sought 
to disinfect the panda house at the zoo and inject the female with periodic 
doses of antibiotics. But the mother's infection returned in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the little cub emerged squealing on Friday, zoo officials 
anesthetized the mother and removed the cub, hoping to build its immune system 
to ward off infection. Instead, they discovered the new cub was already badly 
infected, and it did not have strength to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's possible we can raise a cub" in captivity, Bush said. "This 
one was infected and small, even for a premature one. Just give us a normal 
size cub and no infection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A twin to this cub was spontaneously aborted two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ling-Ling and her mate, Hsing-Hsing, 19, are the only giant pandas on permanent 
display in the United States. In their early years together, the two suffered 
from what zoo officials called "inadequate mating skills." Since 1983, however, 
the two have mated nearly every year, but all of the cubs have died at or 
shortly after birth. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 1,000 giant pandas are believed to be living wild in the mountains 
of central China. Pandas have been bred artificially in zoos in Tokyo, Mexico 
City and Madrid, but the National Zoo's pair are the only ones trying to breed 
naturally, according to zoo officials.

VIOLENCE LEAVES 6 DEAD, 5 HURT IN L.A. AREA OVER WEEKEND

Violence continued to mar the long holiday weekend in the Los Angeles area 
Sunday with six people killed and seven more seriously wounded in seven 
separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
An irate motorist in Compton was booked on suspicion of murder early Sunday 
after authorities said he chased a fleeing hit-and-run driver, forced him to 
stop by ramming his Toyota into the man's car, and then fired at him with a 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer disarmed and arrested Robert Dunlap, 33, of Compton after 
hearing the rear-end crash at Compton Boulevard and Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Mike Lafleur, 37, of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
In Pacoima, meanwhile, Los Angeles police were searching Sunday for a motive in 
the murder-suicide of a young couple. Authorities said Juan Sandoval Marquez, 
22, apparently killed his wife, Juana Nunez Marquez, 20, in their Pacoima 
residence and then drove about three miles to Kagel Canyon Road near Dexter 
Park, where he shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, an unidentified man was fatally stabbed late Saturday 
after he and several friends argued with the assailant in the 700 block of 
South Fetterly Avenue. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Julio 
Luna, 20, of Los Angeles, in connection with the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
In two incidents believed to be gang-related, a man was shot to death sitting 
in his parked car in Santa Fe Springs about 2 a.m. Sunday, and a young man died 
at County-USC Medical Center on Sunday after he was shot in the face Saturday 
night in the 3500 block of Lanfranco Street in East Los Angeles. The names of 
the two victims have not been released and no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Four customers of a crowded check-cashing office in the Walnut Park area, 
including a 76-year-old woman, were wounded when three gunmen attempted to rob 
the office Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesmen said Sunday the masked gunmen opened fire with a 
.30-caliber rifle and two handguns on about 15 customers when they were unable 
to reach employees behind bulletproof glass in the General Check Cashing 
Service Inc. at 2688 E. Florence Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled without getting any money. 
</P>
<P>
Three youths were shot in a gang-related confrontation which occurred in a 
Koreatown parking lot at Elden Avenue and Pico Boulevard shortly before 
midnight Sunday.

SURVEY FINDS AMBIVALENCE ON WORKERS' SATISFACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 90% of working adults express some degree of satisfaction with their 
jobs but barely one in four feel completely satisfied and 40% work strictly for 
the money, according to a new Gallup survey. 
</P>
<P>
The poll of 797 workers, conducted from July 18 to 21 among a random sampling 
of adults in the continental United States, indicated that members of the 
post-World War II generations who entered the work force since the 1960s are 
significantly less satisfied with their jobs than are older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Only 24% of workers between the ages of 18 and 49 are completely satisfied with 
their jobs. Among older workers, the rate is nearly double -- 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Past surveys found that workers became less likely to complain about their jobs 
as they entered their 30s and 40s, but today a surprising number of workers in 
those age groups retain their youthful dissatisfaction, the poll said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 28% of those surveyed overall are completely satisfied with their general 
working life. Thirty percent are completely satisfied with their company, 40% 
are completely satisfied with their boss and 41% are completely satisfied with 
the kind of work they do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when asked whether they could find any satisfaction at all in their job, 
89% of those surveyed answered affirmatively. Experts familiar with research on 
worker attitudes said the high level of general satisfaction underscores a 
longstanding dichotomy between day-to-day job frustrations and the human need 
to feel some fulfillment in one's job. 
</P>
<P>
Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy at George Washington 
University and the author of "Second Thoughts on Work," said polls on job 
satisfaction have traditionally drawn superficial responses. 
</P>
<P>
Every poll since the late 1950s has found job-satisfaction levels between 81% 
and 92% despite simultaneous responses indicating that only about one-third of 
all workers are satisfied with issues like job autonomy or the assistance they 
receive from supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important factor is that people don't want to feel badly about 
themselves," Levitan said. "It's the general psychology of people. . . . We do 
what we do and then we are satisfied with it, because what else can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
"You have to rationalize your life," explained Andrew Kohut, a Gallup staff 
member who worked on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Belous, a senior economist and human-resource specialist with the 
National Planning Assn., a research group sponsored by business, labor and 
agriculture, said he believes that high levels of uncertainty in today's 
workplace make workers less reluctant to complain. 
</P>
<P>
While unemployment remains low, many companies -- even those that are 
financially healthy -- are laying off workers through restructuring plans. That 
trend is expected to continue as a hedge against a potential economic downturn. 
In addition, salaries are being held in check by low inflation and employers 
are increasingly requiring workers to pay for a greater share of their health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in a long economic expansion, but the benefits of this expansion 
have not hit a lot of people," Belous said. "For a lot of people in the work 
force, if they still have that core job with a good company, they're not going 
to complain. They know those jobs are much harder to come by now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really in good times when people start complaining, when you hear people 
talking about things like job enrichment." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Nussbaum, executive director of 9-to-5, a national organization of 
working women that focuses on clerical employees, said, "What we usually find 
is that people like their jobs but they don't like their treatment. Either they 
don't like the people they work for or the place they hold in the system or 
they're not compensated or not given an opportunity to really invest themselves 
in the job. That's the reality for the most part for the people we're working 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure of most jobs prevents you from getting what you go to work for, 
and then you're left saying, 'I only do it for the money,' " Nussbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gallup Poll found that while few workers say they are completely satisfied, 
56% are happy with most or all aspects of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Between 87% and 95% like the security of their jobs, the importance of the work 
they do and the amount of contact they have with other people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
75% Like Their Salary 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one percent like their chances for promotion. Seventy-five percent like 
their salary. (Only 16% are completely satisfied with their pay.) And 67% like 
their health insurance and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings of the Gallup survey: 
</P>
<P>
* The poll found no significant difference in job satisfaction between men and 
women, although it did find that women put in shorter workweeks than men, 
travel less often and tend to have jobs located closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
* Asked if they would continue to work even if they did not need the money, 70% 
of those surveyed said yes, but more than half said the work would not be their 
current job. 
</P>
<P>
* Long hours are common. About 39% of all workers log 45 hours or more in a 
typical week. One in seven say they work 60 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
* Thirty-eight percent are regularly scheduled to work evenings or weekends or 
report they have no set work schedule.

6,500 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS MAY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 6,500 teachers in two California cities prepared Sunday to join 3,500 of 
their brethren on strike in six other states in what has become an annual 
end-of-summer rite. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 teachers are threatening to strike the Sacramento-area school 
districts and there were plans for a walkout by 1,500 teachers in the San Jose 
Unified School District. Walkouts in those jurisdictions would affect about 
120,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,500 teachers are already on picket lines in Ohio, Montana, Michigan, 
Illinois, Pennsylvania and Idaho, affecting more than 60,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
The disputes involve wages, fringe benefits and classroom issues. 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose, year-old talks broke off Saturday and no new sessions were 
scheduled. A strike there would affect 29,000 students when classes resume this 
week. San Jose teachers have worked without a contract since June 30, 1988, and 
are angry because they were not offered a raise. 
</P>
<P>
School officials began contacting substitute teachers and advising parents to 
make day-care plans in the event a strike closed schools. Teachers plan to 
gather at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday before hitting the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly disappointing," said district schools Supt. James Baughman. "We are 
going to attempt, in some way or form, to keep the schools open." 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks were stalled in the Sacramento City Unified School District and 
the suburban San Juan School District northeast of Sacramento. Although 
negotiations were expected to resume, a teachers' spokesman said, "We are still 
looking at a work stoppage Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco school officials and representatives of 2,800 teachers are in 
negotiations but an agreement was predicted by today.. 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, teachers called strikes in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Quincy, 
Ill.; Great Falls, Mont., and in several districts in Michigan, Pennsylvania 
and Ohio.

RULE TO STRIP DRUG USERS OF RECORDS TO BE PUT BEFORE TRACK GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>

<P>
A proposal to strip world records and major championships from athletes who 
admit under oath to having used drugs will be voted on this week by track and 
field's worldwide governing body. 
</P>
<P>
"Any world, continental or national record and title held by an athlete who 
admits having committed a doping offense will no longer stand," reads the 
proposal to the International Amateur Athletic Federation's annual meeting, 
which begins today. 
</P>
<P>
Created in the aftershock of Ben Johnson's disqualification from the Seoul 
Olympics for steroid use and subsequent admission that he began using the 
banned substances in 1981, the proposal would be one of the most dramatic steps 
in the anti-doping drive. 
</P>
<P>
It would give the IAAF the power to erase Johnson's name from the record books, 
since he admitted under oath during a Canadian government inquiry that he used 
steroids to bulk up for his 9.83-second world mark in the 100 meters at the 
World Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Rome in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It also would open a new area in the debate over drugs in sports and how best 
to combat them. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that to retroactively strip an athlete who passed tests at the time 
because he later admitted under oath that he was on drugs would be illegal, and 
that using an athlete's testimony in such a matter would thwart efforts to have 
competitors come to grips with doping. 
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF, stung by the Johnson case, appears ready to take some kind of 
drastic action, then deal with the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"If you confess that you have killed a person one year ago, or 20 years ago, 
always you are confessing to be a killer," federation president Primo Nebiolo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal said records and titles would be stripped "from the day the 
athlete admitted the doping offense." 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Council, its board of directors, approved the measures at a special 
meeting in Vienna, Austria, last July and may briefly review them when it meets 
Monday. The proposal, which would require changes in at least three of track's 
international rules, is due to come before the federation's annual Congress on 
Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
To be adopted, two-thirds of the federation's 160 members present must agree. 
</P>
<P>
John Holt, IAAF general secretary, said, "It will be very strongly put to them 
by Arne Ljundqvist (IAAF medical commission head) and by the president 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Also due for final action are proposals for random drug testing during training 
sessions and other out-of-competition periods, and the institution of "flying 
squads" to test for drugs among track and field athletes any place, any time. 
</P>
<P>
Those two measures would have been considered revolutionary a year ago, before 
Johnson tested positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol after beating 
American Carl Lewis in 9.79 seconds at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
But they pale before the latest proposal, which was all but unthinkable as 
recently as March, when Holt said at the World Indoor Track and Field 
Championships in Budapest, Hungary, that "you cannot retroactively take away 
records, you cannot retroactively take away medals." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson testified less than three months later that he had used steroids since 
1981 and went through a major steroid program before setting the world record 
in 1987. He had been tested at dozens of meets during that time but always 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"The new rule changes represent a response to the latest situation in this 
field," a proposal to the members said. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF also will consider specific rules on out-of-competition testing, 
including timing of surprise tests and considering an athlete who fails to show 
up for a prearranged test guilty of dodging the anti-doping system. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will be presented with a balance sheet showing the federation 
with reserves of $5.1 million at the end of 1988, more than double the amount 
listed 12 months earlier.

Yannick Noah of France and Amos Mansdorf of Israel were fined $500 each Sunday 
for their part in an incident after their third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
Noah, who came from two sets down to win the rain-delayed match completed 
Saturday, was fined by the Men's Tennis Council for an audible obscenity. 
Mansdorf was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when Noah refused to shake hands with Mansdorf after 
their match. Noah, who accused Mansdorf of cursing at his family, repeated the 
obscenity in front of television cameras.

ALL-FEMALE SAILING CREW IS GROUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's last hope for competing in sailing's most prestigious seagoing event 
died for lack of sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
Nance Frank and her all-American, all-woman crew of nine were left behind 
Saturday morning when the Whitbread Round the World race fleet left 
Southampton, England without them. 
</P>
<P>
They joined the other 23 boats at the starting line and sailed along for a few 
minutes -- then returned to port. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said by phone: "It's been a tremendous struggle. A lot of people have 
been looking for money for us. Everyone sees the tremendous promotional 
potential of this race. They just can't understand why an American company 
hasn't seen it. But most American companies don't know what the Whitbread is." 
</P>
<P>
Most participants figured a minimum of $1.5 million was needed to sail the 
entire nine-month, 32,972-nautical mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Another American entry led by Ted Allison of Seattle abandoned a campaign 
earlier, also for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hoped to have at least one U.S. entry because for the first time the 
race will touch a U.S. port, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The city replaced Cape Town 
as a port of call because of South Africa's apartheid policies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States never has had an entry in the event, which was held first in 
1973-74 and every four years since. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, 40, of Florida, was told by the Spanish owner of the boat that she 
couldn't sail unless she had $500,000 to buy it. She was given several 
extensions -- the last right up until race time. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lent us his boat for four months," Frank said. "I think he's been really 
sporting about it. We've been desperately searching for a sponsor for 18 
months." The boat reportedly will be sailed to nearby Lymington and put up for 
sale or auctioned. Frank blamed her plight on corporate America's failure to 
recognize the promotional potential of the event -- although several foreign 
boats among the 24 remaining entries are backed by U.S. companies, including a 
Soviet boat supported by Pepsi-Cola. 
</P>

While all the other boats sported the names and colors of hundreds of sponsors, 
the only distinctive feature on Frank's boat was a U.S. flag flapping on the 
stern and a plastic sheet on the cockpit railing bearing the name of her 
project: U.S. Women's Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy for America," Frank said. "The values of America are wrapped up 
in Hollywood rather than in real adventures."

KORBUT, EX-GYMNASTICS CHAMPION, DECRIES HER TREATMENT BY SOVIETS

Olga Korbut, who captured hearts and medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics, said 
in an interview published Sunday the Soviet Union treated her like "a beggar" 
after she retired from gymnastics and refused to allow her to capitalize on her 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't let me out of the country for 11 years, although there were a 
million invitations. They were keeping me out of harm's way," Korbut, 34, told 
Sovetsky Sport. 
</P>
<P>
Korbut is looking forward to visiting the United States in October at the 
invitation of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said she visited the United States last year and "was happy for the 
first time in years. Here I am out of favor, the wild flibbertigibbet, the 
workhorse standing in line for kolbassi (smoked sausage) for hours, the 
housewife tied down by care for husband, child, car and housework. 
</P>
<P>
"There I felt loved," she said. "They took me for what I am and knew what I had 
once achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut won individual gold medals at the 1972 Olympics for the balance beam and 
floor exercises, and a team gold. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Americans' affection for her, Korbut said when she retired in 
1977 from gymnastics in the Soviet Union, "in an instant I ceased to interest 
anyone, I was no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to be fussed over, but they could have invited me to the 
national championships or sent me on tour abroad with the national team (or) 
said 'happy birthday' at least -- they, the fathers of Soviet sport who made a 
career on my Olympic gold. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a beggar they threw a bone to, thinking, 'Be glad that you get 
anything at all, that we tolerate your doing nothing for so long,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Korbut never became the world champion but at 17 her talent transformed 
gymnastics into a mass spectator sport. 
</P>
<P>
She toured the United States in 1973, performing before sold-out crowds and 
getting a red-carpet welcome by the Nixons at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Her Soviet teammates and coaches objected to the plaudits heaped on Korbut, and 
the official media accused her of self-interest. Two former friends and 
gymnasts stole her trophies, medals and souvenirs from the family home on her 
wedding day. 
</P>
<P>
After her Olympic successes, Korbut was given an above-average salary of 300 
rubles ($470) a month, which was later cut to 200 rubles ($312) a month. She 
was made national gymnastics coach of Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
"But they wouldn't let me do anything worthwhile. They'd tell me to go file the 
papers. They didn't care whether I showed up for work or not. All they cared 
was that I didn't say anything I shouldn't to foreign journalists." 
</P>
<P>
"When foreign reporters got through to me, I was always beautifully packaged, a 
picture of total prosperity, as if to say, 'of course, the country hasn't 
forgotten its idol.' " 
</P>
<P>
Korbut acknowledged that she does not work well within the Soviet system. "I 
can't. I'm made of different stuff than that." 
</P>
<P>
"I am what I am," she said. "And I never yelled 'hip, hip, hurrah' for (former 
Soviet leader) Leonid Ilyich (Brezhnev) or anyone else, for that matter. Had I 
gone and grown potatoes, they would have made a hero out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said she would have liked to have been a "peace ambassador" for the 
Soviet Union or opened a gymnastics school in United States or Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"In the space of 12 years, I could have brought the state a mountain of hard 
currency and I would lead a rich and happy life myself. There wouldn't be any 
sore sports or stress or helplessness or debasement," she said.

BECAUSE OF FREE AGENCY, LAST CUT ISN'T DEEPEST FOR ROBINSON, RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to Plan B free agency, the Rams won't have many painful cuts to make 
today when National Football League teams are required to reduce rosters to 47 
players. 
</P>
<P>
This could have been the day veterans such as Johnnie Johnson, Jim Collins, 
Michael Young and Mickey Sutton took the ax. But those Rams, along with eight 
other veterans, were lost to free agency in the off-season, making today's 
parings more clear cuts, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always hard, facing them," Rams Coach John Robinson said. "I think they 
fall into place for the most part. I don't think very often do you find 
yourself in a position where two guys are equal and you keep one. I think you 
work it out in your mind that you like A better than B. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at would could happen, by position. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: The Rams will keep three quarterbacks on the roster for Atlanta: 
Jim Everett, Mark Herrmann and Steve Dils. When Herrmann is healthy, Dils goes 
back to commercial real estate, opening a roster spot for perhaps unsigned 
first-round fullback, Cleveland Gary. Jeff Carlson could be headed for the new 
developmental squad for rookies and first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
Running backs: The tailbacks are Greg Bell and Gaston Green. Bell, no doubt, 
will start against the Falcons. The fullbacks are Buford McGee and Robert 
Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receivers: Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson, Aaron Cox and Ron Brown. 
Anderson, by virtue of his fine summer and Cox's hamstring injury, moves in as 
a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to take Aaron Cox a little while to work back into it," 
Robinson said. "I'd like to dodge the issue and say we have three wide 
receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Tight ends: Damone Johnson, Pete Holohan and Pat Carter 
</P>
<P>
Offensive line: Seven spots are sewn up by Doug Smith, Jackie Slater, Tom 
Newberry, Irv Pankey, Duval Love, Tony Slaton and Robert Cox. The eighth spot 
is between rookie tackle Kevin Robbins and guard Warren Wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive line: They'll probably go with five: Alvin Wright, Doug Reed, Shawn 
Miller, Bill Hawkins and Mike Piel. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker: The locks are Kevin Greene, Brett Farynairz and Mike 
Wilcher. If the Rams go with four here it's between seventh-rounder George 
Bethune and second-rounder Brian Smith, who hasn't made much noise, but it's 
tough to cut high picks. 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker: Fred Strickland, Larry Kelm, Mel Owens, Frank Stams, and a 
decision between Richard Brown and rookie Mark Messner. If it's Brown, Messner 
could be headed for developmental squad. Brown, a second-year player, doesn't 
qualify. Messner seems to have the inside track. 
</P>
<P>
Secondary: With LeRoy Irvin out another three weeks, the cornerbacks are Jerry 
Gray, Darryl Henley, Cliff Hicks and Alfred Jackson. At safety are Vince 
Newsome, Michael Stewart, Anthony Newman and James Washington. 
</P>
<P>
More about the developmental squad: Players will receive $1,000 per week for 
their services (Don't fret, they get to keep their signing bonuses). Before 
re-signing with the Rams, a player would first have to clear league waivers. 
</P>
<P>
Another interesting question is the future of linebacker Mark Jerue, fighting 
back from another knee surgery. He's weeks away from playing and might be 
headed for six-week injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Also, can Mike McDonald survive again as the long snapper? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Ram sources, tight end Damone Johnson's fine of $38,000 was not 
waived when he reported to camp last Wednesday after his 38-day holdout. 
Because he was under contract and did not report, Johnson was fined $1,000 each 
day. Also, contrary to what Johnson told reporters when he reported, the Rams 
are not renegotiating his $200,000 contract. . . . Linebacker Fred Strickland, 
who had arthroscopic knee surgery in early August, returns to practice this 
week. Coach John Robinson said he stands a better chance of playing against 
Atlanta than Larry Kelm, who missed the last two games with an injured foot.

JOYNER COULD RETURN TO LINEUP TODAY

<P>
Wally Joyner's knee injury kept the Angel first baseman out of Sunday's game 
against the New York Yankees, although he was available for pinch-hitting duty 
and could have played in an emergency, according to Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"He could've played today," Rader said. "But I'm not going to send a guy out 
there with a swollen knee. If he goes out there and plays and it swells up 
more, then we're looking at (him missing) five to 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner hurt his left knee after a collision at first base with New York pitcher 
Greg Cadaret Saturday night and had to been taken from the field on a 
stretcher. X-rays proved negative and the injury was diagnosed as a contusion 
of the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Eppard played in place of Joyner Sunday and could be back in the lineup 
again today. Rader said he would prefer to rest Joyner until the team returns 
home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"With that kind of injury, it usually takes 48 hours after it happens for the 
internal bleeding to stop," Rader said. "That's basically what it is -- a 
bruise. After 48 hours, if it's no worse, the measurable risk is much less. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait and see how stiff and swollen the knee is (today). If it's 
practical that he can play, he will. If not, he won't." MIKE PENNER

TEAM'S SPECIALTY IS GOING THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tracy Dodds 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. national team of distance swimmers broke the Long Beach-to-Catalina 
channel relay record Aug. 11, taking one-hour shifts and completing the channel 
swim in 7 hours 2 minutes 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Wilkerson, Jim McConica, Martha Jahn, Karen Burton, Chad Hundeby and Erica 
Reetz shattered the previous record of 12 hours 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
So, which is more of a surprise? That the record was broken by more than five 
hours or that there is, indeed, a national team of distance swimmers? 
</P>
<P>
"People really don't know what we're doing in distance swimming," U.S. Coach 
Penny Dean said. "Since we set the record as a U.S. team, I've had 15 or 20 
athletes contact me saying that they would like to be considered for the 
national team for the World Championships. These are athletes who didn't even 
know we had a team." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the team is still forming. 
</P>
<P>
To select a team for the Catalina crossing, Dean held a 25-kilometer qualifying 
race and then kept the top three men and the top three women. She worked with 
that group for a week, taking them to different beaches in the Los Angeles 
area, teaching them to deal with kelp and with swimming in the dark -- things 
that lap swimmers don't have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other U.S. swimmers training for distance and there are several 
more who would like to be included on the U.S. team that will compete in the 
distances swims scheduled to be included with the swimming events at the World 
Championships in Australia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
FINA, the international governing body for swimming, will be meeting then and 
might vote to include distance swimming as an Olympic medal event in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dean, FINA could decide to add the 800-meter freestyle relay for 
women to the pool events as well as adding a 16-mile swim (not a relay) for 
individual men's and women's medals, even though it would probably be a 
competition that the men and the women swim concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, who currently holds the individual records for both the English Channel 
swim and the Catalina Channel swim, has had to retire from distance swimming 
because of a problem with her left arm. She is the women's swim coach and water 
polo coach at Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
A team of women representing the Dolphin Club of San Francisco set the women's 
relay record for swimming the English Channel last week. The Channel Swimming 
Federation confirmed their time of 10 hours 49 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Drucker, Susan Cobbe, Carol McGrath, Joani Beemsterboer, Susan Allen and 
Lisa Smith raised the money for the trip and for the official pilot and pilot 
boat (about $2,000) and set out on what they considered an adventure and a 
longshot at the record. Karen Drucker in her phone call home to Los Angeles to 
announce the successful crossing said that it was "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
USC will be the host of a college invitational swim meet, the Grand Prix, Dec. 
1-3 at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Darrell Fick, the USC women's 
coach, said that he expects to have 10 schools each in men's and women's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
So far the men's teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona 
State and Cal State Long Beach, and he expects to add Michigan and Texas. The 
women's teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona State, 
Michigan, Tennessee and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is attempting to put together a 50-yard match race between Tom Jager and 
Matt Biondi, but he has a mountain of red tape to work through on that project. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford women's swim team will include Janet Evans, who has made several 
appearances at the Belmont Plaza pool in the past as a Placentia El Dorado High 
School swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' sweep at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo last month followed by her sweep 
in the Alamo Cup competition against the Soviet team in Atlanta stretched her 
victory streak to 25. She hasn't lost a national or international race (the 
only ones U.S. swimming is counting or the list would be longer) since August 
of 1987 when she lost the 800-meter freestyle in the Pan Pacific Games in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Evans lowered her world record in the 800 during the last Pan Pacific Games, 
swimming an 8:16.22. Her world record was the second for the U.S. team on the 
day that the swimmers set an unprecedented four. 
</P>
<P>
There have never before been four world records set on one day, although there 
were three set July 19, 1976, during the Olympic Games in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman started it when he lowered his own world record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke to 2:12.89. David Wharton got his world record back with a 2:00.11 
in the 200-meter individual medley, and Jager got his world record back when he 
swam a 22.12-second 50. 
</P>
<P>
Jager had lost his world record to Matt Biondi during the Olympic Games last 
fall in Seoul when Biondi won the gold and Jager won the silver. They have now 
passed the world record in the 50 back and forth five times. 
</P>
<P>
Jager and Biondi have raced only once since the Olympics. They were scheduled 
to meet in the national long course meet at USC last month, but Jager was 
disqualified for a false start and had to leave the starting blocks to the boos 
and angry chants of a capacity crowd who thought the official had erred. 
</P>
<P>
The disqualification of Jager from the 50-meter freestyle at the national long 
course meet in Los Angeles last month brought to mind a similar unpopular false 
start call against Mark Spitz -- who was disqualified from a much-anticipated 
100-meter race against Frank Heckl the last time the national meet was held at 
USC in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team victory over the Soviet team in Atlanta last month ran the U.S. 
team's record to 6-0 over the Soviets in dual meets. The series dates back to 
1971. In the Alamo Cup, the U.S. men won their competition, 91-78, and the U.S. 
women won, 106-56. 
</P>
<P>
Hired to attract corporate sponsorship and sell advertising in the official 
program, the Mazza Marketing Group generated $20,850 in connection with the 
Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National Championship swim meet held at 
USC last month. Most of that money will go to the swimming program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some controversy in the past weeks over whether USC is required 
to open the pool on its campus to the public. The pool was built by McDonald's 
on USC land for the 1984 Olympic Games, and, at the time, there was the 
understanding that although USC would control use of the pool after the Games, 
there would be some public use. No one has been able to find that stipulation 
in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
USC has made the pool available to many local swimming organizations for both 
training and meets and does allow serious lap swimmers use of the pool from 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. However, there is no recreational swim time. Swimmers 
must provide proof that they are 16 or older and they must pass a swimming 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jim Dennis, vice president of student affairs at USC, explains that the 
pool does not meet standards for a public recreational-use pool. There is no 
shallow area. It is a 50-meter pool that ranges in depth from 6-feet-7 to 17 
feet. And the lane markers are almost always in place. Users are required to 
pay $25 a semester to help cover the cost of operation.

PETER ADAMS: A RENAISSANCE MAN OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Adams, with his great blue eyes, is living life more intensely than the 
rest of us. He's passionate about art, passionate about travel, passionate 
about history and people, passionate about spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Chat with him and he takes the paintings off the walls, digs in his archives to 
find a Bouguereau print, tells of his escapades in 1981 as the first American 
artist to travel unescorted after China reopened, and his trip a year ago to 
Afghanistan, where he painted and visited wounded moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
Interpersed is the tale of his excursion down an Afghanistan well to retrieve a 
cat. He also writes sonnets. 
</P>
<P>
As a guest ambles through his home and studio on an oak and ivy bluff in 
Pasadena, he throws open closets and models his Far Eastern costumes 
collection. And when he finds a spider on a Russian fur cap, he cradles it in 
his palm, opens a window and blows it to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
One painting of his is a Bhutan fort. Another a Mandarin emblem, another a 
rosewood lamp. The dozens of embroidered pillowcases are Indian. And the 
Tibetan singing bowls require a demonstration: He carefully holds one, rubs it 
round and round, faster and faster, and the bowl hums. In the kitchen, he 
brings out fresh juices to thwart the hot day and the lack of air conditioning. 
And those four dogs on the back porch wagging their tails -- they're the ones 
he runs with every other day on Millard Canyon trails. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Adams, tall and 38, is a novelty, a tender eccentric. Right now, to his 
milieu, he's added the chairmanship of the Festival of the Autumn Moon benefit 
for the Pacific Asia Museum. It's a two-part arrangement -- an open house and 
silent auction for the public Sept. 24 in the museum's Chinese courtyard, and a 
gala dinner and fine art auction Oct. 7 (attire Oriental, tickets $175, catered 
by Rococo) in a decorated tent at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Up for auction will be an 1880 Steinway piano, rare and important Buddhist art 
of the Ming Dynasty, a balloon trip over France's Burgundy terrain, a Ch'ing 
Dynasty lady's robe of embroidered amethyst gauze, a woodblock print by Toradji 
Ishikawa. For starters. Also on the block -- a luxury trip to Japan. Lisa 
Hubbard of Sotheby's will be auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Adams comes from a unique family. His late grandmother, Aileen Macdonald, who 
traveled to China many times and collected Oriental art, was a great influence. 
His late aunt Julie Macdonald was a sculptor and an eccentric who kept baboons 
and hyenas as well as seven or eight dogs in her home, and who, when Ambassador 
College opened, had her daughter streak at the opening because of her objection 
to the building in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
His father, the late Peter Adams, was a part-time actor ("The Robe") and 
businessman. His late grandfather Morgan Adams at one time "owned half of Lake 
Arrowhead," and, adds Peter, "one of his yachts was the first to go through the 
locks of the Panama Canal." His late maternal grandfather George B. Seitz was a 
painter at the Philadelphia Art Academy and became a successful director and 
producer of the "Andy Hardy" series with Pearl White and Mickey Rooney, and, 
according to Adams, is credited with discovering George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
The artistic bent was there. When Adams attended Harvard preparatory school, he 
disliked the paintings in the cafeteria, "So I stole some paints and put up my 
paintings and called myself Von Seitz." Later, he studied at Cal Western in San 
Diego, the Art Center, Otis Art Institute and in Theodore Lukits' studio. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Adams' paintings -- umbrella scenes at the Beach Club, children in 
gardens, the Summer Palace Bejing, air scenes of Pasadena and national parks, 
Tibetan monasteries, the Sierra, moujahedeen on the march -- hang in private 
collections at the California Club and Curtis and Chadwick Schools. 
</P>
<P>
He returned from China with more than 200 paintings. To paint in Afghanistan, 
he dyed his hair, grew a beard, marched with the moujahedeen, painting them and 
later donating proceeds from many of the paintings to the International Medical 
Corps. Only after he returned did he learn a $10,000 bounty was offered on 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of painting these recent days, Adams has been rounding up art for the 
benefit and hosting a pre-party at the home of his uncle Morgan Adams in 
Hancock Park to honor donors.

DRIVER DIES IN ORTEGA ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
VICTIM IS SECOND FATALITY ON HIGHWAY WITHIN A WEEK 
</P>

A Moreno Valley man was killed and his passenger seriously injured early Sunday 
when their car missed a curve along South Orange County's winding Ortega 
Highway and plunged down a 225-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth traffic fatality in Orange and Los Angeles counties thus far 
over the Labor Day weekend, which began Friday night and ends at midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the California Highway Patrol reported Sunday night, at least 42 
people have died this weekend; 53 died during last year's entire Labor Day 
weekend. There have been 1,589 arrests for drunk driving so far this weekend, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Fatality in a Week 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers said the Ortega traffic fatality -- the second in a week on the 
treacherous highway -- occurred about 8:30 a.m. when Fernando Zamora's car, 
traveling east at a high rate of speed and with bald tires, swerved out of 
control and went off the side of a cliff, rolling 225 feet to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora, 37, was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected from the car. His 
passenger, Lona Chavez, 20, also of Moreno Valley, was wearing a seat belt and 
remained inside the tumbling car. The two men were taken by helicopter to 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where Zamora was 
pronounced dead on arrival and Chavez was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
And in Anaheim, a 45-year-old Buena Park man was killed Saturday night when he 
was ejected from his car, apparently when it flipped over on the northbound 
Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car Swerved, Flipped 
</P>
<P>
James Hamilton was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses told the CHP that 
his car began swerving before it flipped in the No. 2 lane of the freeway just 
north of Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified passenger in the car was hurt, a CHP dispatcher said. But the 
extent of those injuries was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher said Hamilton's car was traveling between 55 and 60 m.p.h. when 
the accident occurred about 9 p.m. No other vehicles were involved, the 
dispatcher said. It is not known whether Hamilton was wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a 6-year-old girl was killed Saturday afternoon when the 
bicycle she was riding as a passenger ran a stop sign and was struck by a car 
in the San Fernando Valley. The driver was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday afternoon, a 19-year-old man was struck by two cars and killed as 
he exposed himself to motorists on Pacific Coast Highway near Sunset Boulevard 
in Pacific Palisades. Neither car stopped, and police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Ortega Highway accident was the latest of many on the scenic, 25-mile 
route that connects San Juan Capistrano with Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Car Pileup 
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, on Aug. 25, a 34-year-old Canyon Lakes man was killed and two 
other people were seriously injured in a five-vehicle pileup on the Ortega 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 CHP study found that the accident rate for the Ortega Highway was 146% 
higher than the statewide average for similar highways. Between 1984 and 1986, 
the study said, there were 16 deaths and nearly 300 injuries on the short but 
deadly stretch. Speed was cited as one of the main causes of the unusually high 
accident rate. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the accidents occur on the Orange County side of the highway, which 
bisects the Santa Ana mountains straddling Orange and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly treacherous spot, local residents say, is a straightaway stretch 
just east of Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kathy Rogers, manager of the San Juan Capistrano Hot Springs 
Resort off the highway, the straightaway is particularly dangerous because it 
provides a rare opportunity to pass slower-moving vehicles. Rogers said too 
many motorists take unsafe chances in passing on that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crashes on S-Curves 
</P>
<P>
Many accidents also occur on the sharp, S-curves of the two-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
"People drive too fast when they round the corners, and they either drift over 
the line (into oncoming traffic) or go off the edge," said James Foster, owner 
of the Ortega Oaks Campground and Candy Store. 
</P>
<P>
Motorcyclists racing up and down the highway are responsible for many of the 
accidents, CHP officials and local residents said. The CHP has beefed up 
patrols along the Ortega in recent years to try and deter the speeding, but, 
Foster said, the racing continues every weekend morning -- sometimes as early 
as 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We never get to sleep late, I tell you," Foster said.

PEOPLE: HE STILL HAS A BIG LOVE FOR TRAINS -- BUT ON A SMALL SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Christiaan Anton was growing up in a small town in the Netherlands, he 
rode a train to his elementary school in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, he thought it was thrilling to ride the steam-powered trains. 
</P>
<P>
At 64, Anton continues to ride trains, but now he's also the engineer of his 
own steam engine. 
</P>
<P>
It took five years to build at his Fountain Valley home a miniature of a steam 
locomotive. He built the miniature on a scale of one inch to one foot. Anton 
also built a caboose and boxcars with removable tops to transform them into 
passenger space for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
He takes children on rides along his miniature railroad train layouts in Costa 
Mesa, Riverside County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, kids don't know about steam locomotives, so I built one to show them 
about the old days when we didn't have modern diesel or electric locomotives," 
said Anton. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is no bigger thrill than to take children on a train ride powered 
by his steam engine. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good to see their faces as we go around with the steam 
pouring from my locomotive," he said. "It's also a good feeling to know I make 
it from scratch. I love to do those things." 
</P>
<P>
He uses a combination of distilled water and chemicals to keep the steel boiler 
clean and free from rust. 
</P>
<P>
Anton views his trains as "an educational deal for the kids. I want to show 
them how we did it and maybe some of them will join our train club. That would 
be good, and it helps keep them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Anton makes the children happy, but he says he gets a charge out of it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in big and small trains since I was a child," he 
said in his strong Dutch accent. "I would always get windup trains for my 
birthday and for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Now he makes his own. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have is the love for the steam engine," said Anton, a retired repairman 
for Northwest Airlines. "I feel good when the water is boiling and the timing, 
valves and pistons make it run good." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has taken the locomotive to layouts at Griffith Park in Los Angeles 
and one in Riverside County, he only recently powered the steam locomotive on 
the new model train layout at Fairview Park in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have a train line so close to home," he said. The new train 
layout was created and built by the Orange County Model Engineers group. The 
Boy Scouts helped prepare the circular route and put down the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Next year the train line will be expanded to include a bridge, land grading and 
permanent rails to handle the miniature locomotives and rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Anton is not reluctant to travel long distances to take a ride on full-scale 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
He recently returned from Chattanooga, Tenn., where he rode a train powered by 
a Baldwin steam engine, one of the first steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of their marriage, Kim and Mark Pound of La Habra Heights 
drove a Volkswagen Vanagon, which came in handy eight years ago during the 
birth of their son, Ryan, on the way to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
They noticed recently that Volkswagen of America -- which advertises "There's 
Always Room for One More" -- was searching for "Beetle Babies," children who 
were born in Volkswagens. The company said 400 babies have been born in their 
cars since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The company offered a $300 savings bond to anyone who could prove his or her 
child was born in a Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent them pictures of me and the baby in the Volkswagen right after it was 
born," Kim Pound said, "and they sent the $300 bond." 
</P>
<P>
Since Ryan was born, some things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Pounds now drive a Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed only right that after studying the children's story "The Teddy Bear's 
Picnic," the kindergarten classes of teachers Thais Sainz and Mary Voelkel at 
Grant Elementary School in Santa Ana take a real picnic. 
</P>
<P>
The pupils were asked to bring their teddy bears, friends and parents to help 
them celebrate the two weeks of study on the book and to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the day was fun, the teachers -- as teachers are wont to do -- 
got in some extra teaching -- on counting, sorting, graphing, sequencing and 
art.

BODY FOUND IN GULLY NEAR FREEWAY ON-RAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating possible homicide in the death of a local transient 
whose body was found late Sunday afternoon lying in a gully alongside the 
Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim, 54, was being withheld pending notification of 
family. The cause of death is not yet determined, pending an autopsy scheduled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The fully clothed body was spotted by a passing motorist at 6:50 p.m. Sunday in 
a gully next to the Knott Avenue on-ramp, Buena Park Police Lt. Bill Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no visible sign of trauma, but Cox said homicide is suspected because 
the man's personal effects were scattered and there were signs of a scuffle. 
Coroner's deputies estimated the time of death between noon and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said that there was no indication of possible motive or suspects and that 
the man was known to police, having been arrested three days before for public 
drunkenness. He said the man was in jail several hours, then released.

WOOD SPILL AGGRAVATED CYCLE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cords of firewood that spilled from a flatbed truck aggravated the fiery crash 
that killed five motorcyclists participating in an annual Labor Day weekend 
trip in the Sierra Nevada, the California Highway Patrol said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the load spilled after the driver of the truck crossed into an 
oncoming lane and into the path of dozens of bikers. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, his passenger and a sixth motorcyclist were seriously injured in 
the crash Saturday on a stretch known as the Mormon Emigrant Trail, a mountain 
road about five miles south of Sly Park in El Dorado County, about five miles 
east of Jenkinson Reservoir south of U.S. 50. 
</P>
<P>
The back roads of the Sierra Nevada forest land are the scene of an annual trek 
that attracts hundreds of cycling enthusiasts from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said the victims of the Saturday crash had been biking to the area for 
10 years and were en route to a campsite in the Hope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Fatalities 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two Labor Day traffic fatalities were reported in California by Sunday 
night. Those included that of a highway patrolman who burned to death in San 
Francisco when his car was rear-ended by a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Hugo Olazar, 35, died inside the patrol car, which he had parked on the 
shoulder of a freeway late Saturday night in order to investigate a crash in 
which no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup, Jorge Perez of Daly City, was arrested on suspicion 
of felony driving under the influence of alcohol and vehicular manslaughter. 
Perez was in stable condition at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sierra Nevada incident, investigators were still trying to determine 
whether the motorcyclists were hit by the wood or crashed into it, and at which 
point the bikes and truck collided. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, for some unknown reason, (the driver) crossed over the line and 
lost control, causing (a panel) that held the wood to break," CHP spokeswoman 
Mary Ann Biggs said. "Wood went all over the roadway. The cycles went down; 
then there was a fire at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Charges 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was identified as Daniel DeWater, 24, of Shingle Springs. He 
was listed in serious condition at University Medical Center in Sacramento. His 
passenger, Wanda Robertson, 32, was reported in very critical condition with 
burns over 90% of her body, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in the incident, officials said Sunday.

ESTANCIA FINDS SUCCESS, HOPES TO RIDE ITS MOMENTUM TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anything could spook Sea View League football coaches this season, it would 
be the Cheshire cat grin on the face of Estancia Coach John Liebengood. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of those confident, all-knowing smiles, one that can't be disguised by 
conservative talk -- "We have a few good men. We'll try our best" -- or daunted 
by the very real possibility that perhaps this team won't be able to fulfill 
its lofty expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Although two-time defending champion Corona del Mar is, by reason of recent 
tradition, the slight favorite according to league coaches, there is no doubt 
which team poses the greatest threat to the Sea King throne. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia -- a team which, a year ago, had won just two games (and no league 
games) in the previous two seasons -- became the league's surprise team in 
1988, going 7-3-1 overall and tying for second with Saddleback and University. 
</P>
<P>
And this season, the Eagles have 17 starters -- 30 lettermen overall -- 
returning, including running back Josh Wojtkiewicz, who gained 1,042 yards and 
scored seven touchdowns last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can win league, we feel that should be our main goal," said 
Liebengood, a man who became downright giddy last year after his team tied 
Tustin in its league opener. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get your gold team and your blue team and your black team ready to 
play Estancia anymore," Liebengood said. "Homecoming versus Estancia used to be 
a sure win. Those times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
The changes facing Corona del Mar, the Southern Section Division VI defending 
champion, could spell trouble. Gone are 15 starters, including linebackers John 
Katovsich and Chris Deuchar, who anchored a very impressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sea Kings do return seven starters, including two of the county's best 
defensive back/wide receivers in twins Warren and Weston Johnson. The Johnson 
brothers had six interceptions each last season. 
</P>
<P>
A big question with Corona del Mar is at quarterback. Sophomore Todd Kehrli 
took very few varsity snaps last year, but Sea King Coach Dave Holland appears, 
as always, unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's because last year's quarterback, Ty Price, hadn't taken a varsity 
snap before his senior season, and the Sea Kings played their way to their 
first undefeated season (12-0-2) in school history. 
</P>
<P>
That 14-game undefeated streak -- currently the longest-running in the county 
-- will no doubt supply each Corona del Mar opponent with plenty of added 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from Estancia -- which faces Corona del Mar in the league opener Oct. 
15 -- Tustin and Saddleback look to be the next biggest threats. Newport Harbor 
and University are lacking a bit in depth and even more so in experience, but 
as the typically well-balanced Sea View League has proved many times in recent 
years, anything can happen once league play begins. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look: 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR -- The 1988-89 school year was a great one for the Sea King 
athletic program. Corona del Mar won not only the Division VI football title, 
but Southern Section titles in water polo and girls' tennis (team and 
individual), and a state championship in boys' cross-country. Plus, the boys' 
basketball team was a Southern Section finalist. 
</P>
<P>
What's the significance? Corona del Mar's class of '89 featured the best group 
of athletes in the school's 26-year history. That worked especially well for 
the football team, where the depth of quality athletes was evident. 
</P>
<P>
While graduation didn't exactly wipe out the football team, it has opened a few 
holes. "Actually, we have a lot of talent with the juniors coming up," Holland 
said. "We're more inexperienced than we were at this time last year, but we do 
have talent." 
</P>
<P>
Senior running backs Brian Lucas, Ron Akin and Jerrott Willard figure to lead 
the Sea King running game this season. While the Johnson twins are capable 
receivers, the burden lies on Kehrli as to whether the Sea Kings will have an 
adequate air attack. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Jeff Jackson and linemen Mike Kelly and Bobby Hall are the other 
starters returners for Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
ESTANCIA -- On paper, this looks to be the Eagles' year. And Liebengood, not 
one to downplay whatever positive thoughts are streaking through his brain, can 
hardly contain his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, his hyper-happy mood should help his team -- not that it's lacking 
confidence after last season. One problem for the Eagles: They won't be able to 
surprise many teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows what we have," Liebengood said. "I think the key is they 
(opposing coaches) are thinking how cocky we are. But the kids are confident, 
not cocky. They know who the teams are that are gonna be good." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Wojtkiewicz, who Liebengood said is stronger and quicker this year, 
the Eagles have returning tailback Gary Burrows, all-league tight end Dan 
Petrone and Kevin Thomas, an all-Southern Section defensive end whom Liebengood 
may utilize as an extra running back. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia seems to be solid defensively, with nine starters returning. A 
question exists at quarterback, though. Last year, Dan Ucker was the Eagle main 
quarterback, with Jeff Desandro the backup. Both return and figure to follow 
the same test-and-see formula. 
</P>
<P>
For Estancia, the biggest question is simple: Can the Eagles demonstrate this 
season that their 1988 season was no fluke? 
</P>
<P>
The league opener against Corona del Mar will provide much of the answer. 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT HARBOR -- Although 10 starters return, the Sailors lost to graduation 
their best running back in Tom Walker and the league's lineman of the year in 
Dain Mangall. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Jeff Brinkley is confident that quarterback Steve Scheck -- who 
started the last four games of the season -- can provide a much-needed boost. 
Scheck, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior, completed more than 60% of his passes last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Four of five offensive linemen return, including all-leaguer Hoby Parks and Ian 
Long, the 6-6, 280-pound son of 1964 Olympic shotput champion Dallas Long. Two 
linebackers -- Ryan Abbey and Wayne Fraiser -- also return, but after that, 
Newport Harbor's inexperience and lack of depth begins to show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough," Brinkley said. "There are no breathers in this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
SADDLEBACK -- Last year was something of a roller-coaster ride for the 
Roadrunners. They lost their first three games, and were 1-4 going into league 
play. There were flashes of brilliance (a 21-point third quarter against 
University) and moments of complete frustration (a scoreless tie against Corona 
del Mar). 
</P>
<P>
But Saddleback came on toward the end, playing its way into the second round of 
the playoffs, where it lost to Pacifica, 28-9. 
</P>
<P>
Losing Jeff Blanco, the league's top quarterback, and Beto Zavala, its best 
kicker, to graduation didn't help. But of the eight starters returning, one -- 
wide receiver Juan Acuna -- was the team's leading scorer last year, with eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Although Acuna is back, junior quarterback Paul Delgado is untested, so look 
for a lot of work from returning running backs Tony Colthirst and J.J. Fejeran. 
Both are juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Kelly Jackson and offensive guard Rey Siller are the only 
returning linemen. 
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN -- Last year at this time, Coach Marijon Ancich was extremely optimistic 
as his team had talent, size and quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Ancich, his team also had many injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback/defensive back Monte Jones, one of the league's best overall 
athletes, was out with injuries midway through the league season. The Tillers' 
entire linebacker corps was out by the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
"Some were little things, that ankle, this nose, that whatever," Ancich said. 
"It was just crazy things that didn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The result was an erratic team -- one that upset El Toro but won just one 
league game -- and a dismayed coach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ancich says he's just trying to form a cohesive team out of a fairly 
inexperienced bunch.

<P>
"(Practice) has been so fundamental, it's boring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense must mature quickly (only two starters return), our ball control 
must improve, and our kicking game needs work." 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Andy Borza, up from a league champion sophomore team, will 
guide the team. The highlight of the team may be at running back, where Tustin 
seems to be blessed with four quality players: returning starters Visko Ancich 
and Ron Goods, both sophomores, plus Kelvin Love, a senior transfer from 
Florida, and Chad Faltz, who was injured last season. 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY -- With only five starters returning as seniors, the Trojans are 
very young. Coach Mark Cunningham said four sophomores will start. 
</P>
<P>
University graduated almost every player at a skill position, including Jim 
Roberson (911 yards, seven touchdowns, five field goals, 13 PATs) and Gary 
Smarr (636 yards, eight touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
All-league shortstop Brian Vail, a 5-9, 160-pound junior, will start at 
quarterback, with 6-4 sophomore Donnell Dowdy as his backup. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good team quickness. Other than that, we're extremely inexperienced," 
Cunningham said. "But since no one knows who's starting yet right now, 
everyone's real hungry. The intensity is there."

'ART AND ARCHITECTURE' BUILDS ON INFIRM FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first drove around Orange County four years ago, I was struck by several 
unfamiliar sights: breathtaking views of the ocean, strange flocks of bobbing 
dinosaurlike oil wells and sprawling swaths of ugly new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Even after closer acquaintance, it seems clear that -- except for a sprinkling 
of redoubtable old structures (such as the Old Orange County Courthouse in 
Santa Ana) and a very few distinctive contemporary ones (such as Michael 
Graves' San Juan Capistrano Library) -- the county is largely an architectural 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the idea of an exhibit of Orange County artists' views of 
architecture particularly beguiling. How do artists dream about space? And how 
are their viewpoints shaped by living in a world of lowbrow buildings? 
</P>
<P>
"Art and Architecture" at the Art Store Gallery (through Sept. 26) contains 
work by 10 county artists that deals with such topics as suburban interiors, 
ecological balance, postmodern stylishness and the ways light and space can 
interact. Although -- as is often the case with theme shows -- some irrelevant 
and unformed pieces seem to have been dragged in out of sheer desperation, 
several works offer fresh points of view. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Bray's "Blind Window/Blank Wall" is the most minimal and delicate of 
these: A series of seven white-lacquered wire rectangles are attached on one 
side to the wall, each positioned slightly above the next. Hanging from the top 
of each rectangle, like a window shade, is a single sheet of white handmade 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The shadow patterns created by lights beamed on the rectangles differ ever so 
slightly from one to another and vary according to the viewer's position and 
the smallest gusts of air. The first rectangle -- bent in such a way that its 
silhouette looks somewhat like a coat swinging out as its wearer walks -- 
allows the paper to hang straight down. The others, twisting more discreetly, 
allow the paper to fly back or forth or curl up slightly. 
</P>
<P>
With roots in minimalism and the light-and-space movement, the piece offers a 
gentle reverie on a basic component of architecture. Instead of penetrating 
solid wall, as windows do, these forms "draw" on it with the help of light, 
which real window blinds are designed to block out. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Urban, who graduated from the masters program at Cal State Fullerton a few 
years ago, offers a promising group of small, punchy paintings that incorporate 
one or two capitalized words -- rather like skewed environmentally aware 
versions of old-fashioned school primers. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bumper Crop," stacks of identical cars (like ears of corn in an 
agricultural yield diagram) fill in the contours of a giant building that rises 
against a blowup of an interstate map crossed with red arteries. "Concrete 
Hillside," an oxymoron if ever there was one, offers an abstract pattern of 
man-made wavy-contoured "fields." 
</P>
<P>
Janice De Loof specializes in simple compositions of tiny profiled chairs and 
lone barking dogs within bland, blank interiors. In a slight departure from 
this formula, "Desert View/Conversation," a mixed-media pastel, shows profiled 
figures sitting passively with their arms at their sides in sparsely furnished 
rooms that have no floors -- which seems to paint a portrait of Sunbelt 
dwellers as rootless folk whose minds may be as unfurnished as their houses. 
But, as in De Loof's other works, a cheery air of suburban uplift (bright 
colors, "cute," tiny objects) waters down the stark flavor the artist seems to 
be after. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Kallan's rather self-consciously stylized paintings of airless spaces are 
littered with askew facades in rich marbleized hues and lurching poles casting 
strong shadows. Poised somewhere between abstraction and figuration, these 
images suggest a bruised, impermanent world of vague menace and delicate 
balances. 
</P>
<P>
The works by Claremont Colleges graduate student Aaron Parazette, however -- 
pink enamel paintings with cutouts representing the window-grid cliches of 
International Style office buildings -- merely co-opt the blandness of their 
architectural sources. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Cummings' post-earthquake, cracked "Cement House" and her charred-wood, 
rope-fastened "Burnt House" are reminders of the ultimate fragility of our 
domiciles. Cummings, a graduate student at UC Irvine, is moving toward strong, 
elemental imagery that is still perhaps too much in thrall to the superficial 
tenets of good design. 
</P>
<P>
John Hesketh's eerily lighted Cibachrome photographs wander off in several 
directions without quite reaching any particular destination. In "Pickets," 
cemetery crosses, dog paws and a pair of bare human feet mysteriously enter the 
unearthly green plot of grass inside a tidy picket fence. The effect is rather 
like combining the plot of a children's book with the outre film "Blue Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists in the show are Doug Moran (inadequately represented by a few 
hard-to-decipher mixed-media drawings), Thomas Chambers (whose trendy 
asymmetrical vessels seem to have wandered in from another show) and Ray Jacobs 
(who does colorful toylike furniture and building facades offering bland, 
cutesy takeoffs on postmodernist cliches). 
</P>
<P>
Missing, however -- yup, here comes my theme song -- is a full-fledged essay 
that comes right out and comments on what connection, if any, these pieces seem 
to have with the environment in which the artists live and work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Art and Architecture" continues through Sept. 26 at the Art Store Gallery, 
4040 Campus Drive, Newport Beach. The gallery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Mondays through Fridays and from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Admission is 
free. Information: (714) 250-7353.

LINCOLN LOOMING AGAIN AS TEAM TO BEATCITY CENTRAL FOOTBALL PREVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln High has a posture not unlike that of Chicago's Sears Tower -- it has 
always cast a long, dark shadow over its football neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lincoln was 9-1, enough to take the luster off second-placce 
Crawford's 7-3 finish. 
</P>
<P>
This year, not even Crawford appears to have the strength to stay that close. 
Lincoln has 22 lettermen back, 14 of whom were all-league. A title this season 
would e Lincoln's six since 1981, the league's first year. The Hornets have a 
42-3 league record; they began preparations for their title defense with a 40-8 
victory over Cardozo of Washington, D.C., Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But winners are not simply crowned; they first must play out the season. One 
team, Crawford, is intent on taking a wrecking ball to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contenders: Lincoln (9-1), Crawford (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: St. Augustine (2-8). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for Improvement: Christian (6-4), Hoover (3-7), San Diego (1-8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Crawford vs. Lincoln at Mesa College oct. 14. The football 
will be a baton passed freely among many of the county's top sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The man: Vernon Shaver. The Crawford senior is the kind of wide receiver 
responsible for giving defensive backs nicknames such as Toast. But Shaver, a 
10.9-second 100-meter sprinter, also presents problems for his own coaching 
staff: "We'll have to do a decent job of coaching to free him up against double 
and triple coverage," said Dan Armstrong, the Crawford coach. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Raymond Thompson's shoes? Thompson was an all-stae offensive 
tackle for Crawford and a major reason the Colts got to the playoffs as the 
league's second-place finisher. If Crawford is to at least match that finish, 
then Tom Nickel, 6-feet-2 1/2, must pick up where Thompson left off. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be valued not only because he knows who he's supposed to block, but also 
because he knows who everyone else is supposed to block," was Armstrong's way 
of explaining how a student with a 4.0 great-point average aids a football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
While Thompson is expected to clear the way, Peer Irvin, a senior who wsa 
ineligible last year, is expected to run behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough -- he's going to be real good," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Some opponents may find a sign of hope in the fact 
that quarterback Dave Drake is not among Lincoln's 22 returners. But Lincoln 
Coach Vic Player has a little something up his sleeve. He insists that Drake's 
replacement, junior Mike Temple, improves that position. 
</P>
<P>
Not only can Temple throw long and accurately, but he also has targets who can 
get behind a secondary. Flanker Dwayne McAfee, fullback Charles Brown (who ran 
for 163 yards and two touchdowns in the opening victory), wide receiver Scott 
Hammond and tailback Doug Boyd made up Lincoln's state-meet-qualifying 
400-meter relay team, which ran 41.9 seconds last spring. Now they'll see how 
fast they are on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on defense: Keith Green, an all-league free safety with San 
Diego one year ago, may be one of the few guys in the leavue able to contain 
Crawford's Shaver. He, too, has 10.9 speed in the 100. St. Augustine will rely 
on Tom Corona, a starter at free safety as a sophomore who missed last season 
because of an injury, to shore up its secondary. One other defensive back to 
keep an eye on: Lincoln's Peter Thrift. He was a CIF all-section performer last 
year. Lincoln intercepted five passes, returning one for a touchdown, in its 
opening victory. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Private matters: Marty Martin, St. Augustine's second-year coach, wasn't the 
only guy to transfer from Christian High to St. Augustine over the past two 
years. Coming over this summer were three playres: Josh Broullitte, who plays 
on both the offensive and defensive lines; Hunter Buckner, who hopes to live up 
to his first name as an outside linebacker and will double as a running back; 
and Barrett Precor, another linebacker/running back. 
</P>
<P>
All three started for Martin as sophomores two years ago at Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Central League coach, "The guy (Martin) is recruiting again." 
</P>
<P>
Execpt at private schools, it's not called recruiting; it's called 
transferring. 
</P>
<P>
No laughing matter: St. Augustine has been the league's laughingstock since 
1982, its last winning season, but coaches say that's about to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty's a good coach," said Hoover's JOhn Johnson. "He's had a history of 
improving programs." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Martin took over a Christian team that had suffered through three 
consecutive losing seasons. In the next four years under Martin, Christian went 
6-3-1, 7-3, 6-6 and 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine went 2-8 in 1988, Martin's first year. 
</P>
<P>
It's the speed that matters: As far as swiftness goes, no one will be able to 
catch Lincoln. Not only will the school's 400-meter relay team perform on the 
football field this fall, but so will its 1,600-meter relay, eighth fastest in 
the section last year. The members: Hammond, John McCartney, TE/CB; Terrell 
Davis, FB/DE; and Hanno Readen, DE. 
</P>
<P>
As long as we're talking track and field, let's mention Lincoln receiver Deion 
Cheeks. He was a 6-foot-6 high jumper last spring and this fall will allow 
Lincoln to "reinstitute the alley-oop pass," Player said. 
</P>
<P>
Matters of opinion: A bold Vic Player of Lincoln -- "I think our league, right 
now, everybody's going to be tougher than last year." 
</P>
<P>
A bolder Dan Armstrong of Crawford -- "I think we're going to be on top. We 
always play Lincoln tough (13-9 loss in 1988), and we have just as good a 
chance as anyone to beat Lincoln this year." 
</P>
<P>
An even bolder Marty Martin of St. Augustine: "We'll be right in the thick of 
things . . . if we can stay healthy."
