IF THEY WERE ELIGIBLE, ADMIT THEM; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHBISHOP ROGER M. MAHONY IS RIGHT ABOUT THE NEED TO CORRECT INS' AMNESTY 
SNAFU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all the controversy that preceded enactment of the 1986 Immigration Reform 
and Control Act -- and that has continued since it took effect -- there is 
widespread consensus that one good thing the new law did was allow millions of 
otherwise honest illegal immigrants to come out of hiding. 
</P>
<P>
That happened because IRCA, as it is commonly referred to, included an amnesty 
program for persons who had illegally entered the country before 1982 but were 
willing to report themselves to the government and apply for legalization of 
their immigrant status. More than 3 million people, one-third of them in the 
greater Los Angeles area, took advantage of that offer. 
</P>
<P>
IRCA's amnesty program was unprecedented in many ways, not just in size and 
scope, but also in the speed with which the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and dozens of immigrant-aid groups had to implement it. Not 
surprisingly, there was occasional confusion, and it's now becoming clear that 
some persons who qualified for amnesty got lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony estimates that as many 
as 200,000 persons who were otherwise eligible for amnesty did not file 
applications by the May, 1988, deadline because they were turned away by INS 
clerks who did not understand all the new IRCA regulations. INS officials do 
not dispute that mistakes occurred, but they question that they happened in 
such large numbers. They point out, for example, that of 5,456 "late amnesty" 
applications their Los Angeles office handled in July, only 243 qualified for 
amnesty. INS officials say that they suspect that many illegal immigrants are 
filing fraudulent late-amnesty applications in the hope of slipping into the 
program even though the cutoff date was more than two years ago. The agency has 
asked the courts to terminate the late application process, even if it means 
penalizing a few legitimate amnesty applicants. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a mistake. Even if some amnesty applicants try to abuse the 
process, Congress intended for IRCA to help every immigrant who could qualify. 
Even if only a small percentage of the late applicants are entitled to amnesty, 
that's at least a few more people who will be helped by a well-intentioned 
reform. By trying to stop the late amnesty process on technicalities, INS is 
being at best rigidly bureaucratic and at worst downright cold-hearted. 
Congress should order INS to keep the amnesty program going as long as anyone 
is eligible.

A GENERATION WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE; 
</P>
<P>
IGNORING PLIGHT OF YOUNG BLACK MEN WON'T SOLVE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1965, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an assistant secretary of Labor, wrote a 
damning but prophetic assessment. In "The Negro Family: The Case for National 
Action," he described the legacy of three centuries of degradation, poverty and 
injustice: slums filled with poor black Americans who knew only "a cycle of no 
jobs, bad education and bad housing." 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Moynihan recommended a national policy emphasizing education and 
employment to stem the decline of the black family. But black leaders -- stung 
by decades of criticisms that blamed the victim -- branded the assessment as 
"racist." The controversy stalled the recommendations. The misery multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
As the statistics worsen, enlightened self-interest and pragmatism must inspire 
solutions. America cannot afford to write off a generation of poor young black 
men. As the number of white males declines to 20% of the market, employers will 
need young black men. 
</P>
<P>
Government must also put forward initiatives. The Bush Administration this year 
decided against proposing major new programs to reduce poverty because the 
ambitious strategies were too controversial or too expensive. Given the gloomy 
economic forecast, looming deficits and the threat of war, government alone 
cannot meet the massive challenges. But inaction also has its price: An example 
is the spiraling billions spent on prisons and the criminal justice system, 
which are disproportionately filled with black men. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's Health and Human Services secretary, Dr. Louis W. 
Sullivan, regards the crisis as a national public health problem and a criminal 
justice problem. He advocates prevention programs such as Head Start, which was 
expanded significantly this year, and a curriculum that teaches students to 
resolve conflicts nonviolently. 
</P>
<P>
Black organizations, most notably the Urban League, the Nation of Islam and the 
NAACP have taken the lead with their advocacy of parenting classes, black male 
teachers, school-based clinics, preventive medicine, tutoring, mentoring and 
job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP recently organized nearly 100 black organizations representing 
various professionals and churchgoers to encourage greater self-help. The newly 
formed National Assn.of Black Organizations represents more than 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Massive help must come from successful black Americans, who, like J. Clay 
Smith, a law professor at Howard University, believe they must lift as they 
climb. Smith tutors homeless children through a program set up by 100 Black 
Men, a national organization that nurtures young black scholars, finances 
scholarships, provides mentors and funds other services. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, deep problems sometimes call for radical solutions. Dr. Franklyn 
Jenifer, president of Howard University, calls for the establishment of urban 
residential schools, similar to prep schools, within the black community, where 
young African-Americans would be educated not only in the ways of the academic 
world, but in the ways of community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest of every thinking person in America to care and act on 
the plight facing many of the nation's poor young black men. Walls and fences 
and oceans and freeways can keep the problems of others only so far away. Their 
vulnerabilities are those of this nation.

Young Americans are being sent off to die for gas guzzlers. Essentially 
television is whooping it up for flag and glory while Texas oilmen and Arab 
sheiks pipe the tune. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines and newspapers, however, are giving a more responsible and sober 
assessment of the costs of war in the Middle East. Persian Gulf military 
operations are now costing American taxpayers $1 million an hour and could go 
as high as $1 billion a day if war erupts. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine what miracles could be performed if these millions (or 
billions) were spent on energy efficiency instead of an oil war? No American 
hostages, no gas gouging at the pump, no clogged freeways, no smog-shrouded 
cities, cleaner air and fewer deaths from cancer. It would also mean 
preservation of America's coastal treasures from offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as Americans sink deeper into debt and smog because of oil blackmail, 
they see Texas oilman George Bush doing nothing to promote energy efficiency as 
he himself roars along the coast of Maine in a powerboat that reportedly burns 
up to 25 gallons of gasoline an hour. Moreover, he resists efforts by Congress 
to pass an automobile fuel-efficiency bill. 
</P>
<P>
We Americans should fire a shout loud enough to be heard around the world -- 
"Off oil!"

I wholeheartedly agree with Jerome Karabel's call for universal military 
service. ("Doctors' Sons Won't Die in the Desert," Commentary, Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
The moral benefit to the nation would be incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, I decided, at the last minute, not to argue my case to be classified 
as a conscientious objector before my local draft board. I knew that I was not 
a pacifist and I did not believe that CO status was justified on any other 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I saw that whether young men avoided the draft on moral grounds, or 
simply because they were looking out for their own skins, was irrelevant 
compared to the moral and intellectual failures by which Washington's "best and 
brightest" sent America's youth to die in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Karabel is certainly correct in suggesting that politicians are more prone to 
send our young people abroad -- to guarantee our continued access to the 
resources of other nations -- when the sons and daughters of affluent campaign 
contributors are not among them. 
</P>
<P>
No one denies that the military needs professionals to provide continuity and 
competence. It also needs a true cross-section of young Americans rotating 
through the services (through a no-exceptions lottery, for example), so that 
the parents of our affluent youth will pay more attention when Washington's 
civilian warriors start talking about sending them to kill and die overseas.

RACIAL DIVISION ON CAMPUSES SADLY MIRRORS THE 'REAL WORLD'; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITIES: THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF SEPARATION, A SORRY LACK OF COMMON 
GROUND WHERE PEOPLE CAN TALK ABOUT RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man was talking about what he calls the "re-segregation" of American life. 
He was a veteran of the civil-rights movement, and went South as a student in 
the '60s when whites and blacks fought American apartheid together. 
</P>
<P>
The man went on to make his life in a Midwestern university, where he was my 
guide one spring day. Indeed, he taught about race in America until he felt 
discredited on account of his skin color -- white -- and went into 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Walking me into the student union, he said: "Look." The tables in front of me 
were nearly as segregated as a lunch counter in the Alabama of the 1960s. There 
was just one table where black and white undergraduates ate in noisy 
camaraderie. They, my guide explained, were members of the varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing, he counted on one hand the number of places where blacks and whites 
interact on his campus these days: in sports, in the arts or, he added 
ironically, in race-relations class. 
</P>
<P>
I brought this story home to a woman who disputed only the term 
"re-segregation." We never desegregated, she says. An academic and a black, she 
knows very few people who ever had social lives that easily transversed the 
color lines. 
</P>
<P>
As a mother, she sees her grade-school kids with friends of all hues, but her 
college students subdivided by skin color. So she also wonders when it happens 
and why. Many of her black students believe they can integrate only on white 
terms and turf. Many of her white students feel unwelcomed by blacks. Many feel 
unwelcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Who was defensive and who was racist and who was just uncomfortable? And why 
this great silence today between blacks and whites about race relations in 
America? 
</P>
<P>
Both of these academics, now enjoying the summer that is their chief 
professional perk, can cite incidents over the past year. Graffiti, hostility, 
tension. Yet they would agree that these are by no means the worst days on 
campus or the worst years. They remember the KKK, Mississippi, legal 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
But they also know that nearly every campus holds a volatile mix of attitudes 
that in no way resembles a melting pot. In some places, whites believe that 
their black classmates were admitted because of their race. In others, blacks 
believe that whites believe that. 
</P>
<P>
On many universities, the black search for identity -- their own place on a 
white campus -- can end up fusing blackness with victimization. In many 
universities, white classmates resent the racist label brushing them 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of my guides believes that campuses are unique in their sharp 
segregations. Quite the opposite is true, they say. Look around the office. 
Look around town. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, it is still almost impossible for blacks and whites to talk 
about the trial of Mayor Marion Barry. To most whites in the nation's capital, 
the case was about the mayor and his alleged use of drugs. To most blacks the 
case was about the entrapment of a black leader. 
</P>
<P>
Even in journalism, bylines often come color-coded. White journalists are 
awkward writing about blacks, as if race were a qualification. Black 
journalists are often required to write about "their own" and discredited for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In our cities, there are neighborhoods as separated by race as ever in our 
history. There are people who speak for the "black community" and the "white 
community" as if their apartness were an accepted and permanent reality. But 
universities have often thought of themselves as models, communities of 
scholars. At best, they are expected to uphold their own values. At a minimum, 
they are places where we are to think and talk deeply about what troubles the 
"real world." 
</P>
<P>
The universities are re-opening. They start each new year with a fresh 
curriculum. But what troubles the real world as much as anything these days is 
race relations. It's a problem that exists on a scale as large as a city. But 
it can also be seen -- and changed -- on a scale as small as a dining-room 
table.

IRAQ: SADDAM HUSSEIN MAY NOT BE HITLER, BUT HE IS AN IMPRESSIVE TROUBLEMAKER 
WHO NEEDS TO BE CHECKED.

<P>
If lucky, the world can usually count on a policeman or two: powers whose 
values and interests predispose them to make sacrifices to uphold rudimentary 
rules of civility. Marauders, bullies, thieves and plunderers ready to abuse 
those rules are never in short supply. In Winston Churchill's vivid image, they 
move constantly through our common household, trying the doors to see whether 
they're locked. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean parallel to the present confrontation with Iraq may yet prove to be 
the right one. It was the first decision of the Cold War period to take up 
arms, as this is the first after it. These decisions to intervene when less 
than national survival is at stake are inevitably shots in the dark, more the 
product of hunch than analysis, uncertain in result. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sober intuition about the balance of power that prompts American 
intervention in the Persian Gulf. Unfortunately, President Bush, who is not a 
man of eloquence, has not explained it very well. But the unprecedented 
unanimity of nations, reflected in the resolutions of the U.N. Security 
Council, shows that far more than "cheap gas" is at issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein of Iraq may be no monster of Hitler dimensions. But he is an impressive 
troublemaker who needs to be checked. His recent career shows it. After the 
Shah's fall in Iran, he scrapped a solemn treaty and tried to grab the 
Shatt-al-Arab waterway. That cost the blood of millions. Earlier, he had tried 
to develop a nuclear bomb with which to threaten Israel (and others too, no 
doubt). And but for the boldness of Menachem Begin, who bombed out his nuclear 
plant, he might have succeeded. What powers of blackmail Saddam Hussein would 
now wield if that enterprise had succeeded one can only imagine. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he tried to import huge "pipeline" segments that were in fact 
the sections of a long-range artillery piece of sinister size. Some neighbor, 
or perhaps the Kurds, would have felt its wrath. In that he was thwarted by 
British customs. ("If it was a pipeline," an informed friend told me in London 
recently, "it was the first rifled pipeline in history.") 
</P>
<P>
Balked in all these adventures, Hussein's new goal was to pillage Kuwait and 
grab control of a substantial part of the world's oil reserves. No doubt it 
would delight him to force Americans to pay more for gas. But that would only 
be the cream on the vast power that oil blackmail would make available. That is 
what such bullies and megalomaniacs seek; and the only deterrent they recognize 
is cold steel. 
</P>
<P>
Playing world policeman gambles with the American public's isolationist 
instincts. But a stitch in time can save nine. When he moved to check North 
Korean aggression in June, 1950, Harry Truman and his advisers assumed, 
incorrectly, that it was orchestrated by Stalin as part of a global strategy. 
Still, timely action then reduced the odds of nuclear war later. 
</P>
<P>
As Gilbert and Sullivan told us, "The policeman's lot is not an 'appy one." It 
is merely necessary.

THE THREAT AND THE GLORY REFLECTIONS ON SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS BY P.D. MEDAWAR

<TEXT>
<P>
I wish I had known Peter Medawar, the British Nobelist who received the prize 
for physiology or medicine in 1960. Those who did, speak of him with awe. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts he was brilliant and gracious, a humanist with a gift for 
explaining his passion in graceful prose. 
</P>
<P>
As a scientist he expanded the curative power of medicine when he successfully 
grafted "foreign" cells onto an animal still in utero, overcoming the problem 
of tissue rejection and opening up the field of immunology, including the 
ability to transplant organs from one individual to another. 
</P>
<P>
He was a towering figure literally (he stood more than 6 feet tall) and 
figuratively, with students and friends around the world. Medawar wrote for the 
general public and was frequently invited to lecture and review. 
</P>
<P>
"The Threat and the Glory: Reflections on Science and Scientists" is a 
posthumous collection of these articles and talks, some published before, 
others in print for the first time, all reflecting Medawar's thoughts about 
science from the late 1950s until his death in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 23 chapters range from fascinating "bench" stories of life in the lab, such 
as "The Strange Case of the Spotted Mice," to a defense of the use of animals 
in research, six talks about "The Future of Man" delivered in 1959, and 
thoughts on dying, written between the strokes that incapacitated him but never 
completely prevented him from working. 
</P>
<P>
As director of Britain's National Institute for Medical Research, Medawar was 
often attacked by antivivisectionists. In the Paget Lecture in 1966, sponsored 
by the Research Defense Society, he addressed the use of experimental animals 
to enlarge medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Trained initially as a zoologist, Medawar was interested in evolutionary 
theory, especially the question of "fitness" in humans as well as animals. He 
thought of the animal rights sentiment in Britain as a recent trend -- going 
back only 170 years -- and faulted rights advocates for their sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
Then turning to the National Institute for Medical Research, where animals were 
bred and cared for by professionals familiar with their genetic composition and 
history, he supported what he referred to as "the 3 R's of humane laboratory 
practice: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement": reduction in numbers of 
animals used, refinement of experimental techniques, and their eventual 
replacement by tissue culture and computer simulation. 
</P>
<P>
What is interesting for an American reader is the directive that in Britain 
animals can be used only when an immediate medical application is foreseen. 
Medawar found this restriction cramping. He emphasized the need for pure 
research, which would necessitate the use of more animals in the laboratory. He 
acknowledged the right of the general public to know about all animal research 
but wanted this research expanded to include any that would advance human 
welfare. And Medawar defined human welfare as more than physical health, but as 
the satisfaction of what he saw as a species-specific compulsion to explore the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Critics today, including scientists like Jane Goodall, suggest that the 
satisfaction of human curiosity is not the unmitigated good that has been 
preached since the Enlightenment, and that science can overstep its role. 
Medawar would adamantly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too late now to adopt an intellectually pastoral existence . . . too 
late to cease to be ambitious." And for this ambition to be satisfied, he 
maintained, living animals will be needed for research, albeit in declining 
numbers, for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
Medawar was an unabashed "speciesist" who made no apologies for his 
championship of Homo sapiens. In "The Future of Man," six talks for the Reith 
lectures of 1959 that compose a third of this volume, Medawar pondered our 
evolutionary future, including the possibility that advances in medicine may be 
regressive, enabling the supposedly "unfit" to reproduce "and the dangers, real 
or imagined, of the genetic deterioration brought about by the propagation of 
the genetically unfit." 
</P>
<P>
These fears are part of an English scientific preoccupation with degeneration, 
articulated earlier in the century by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and much 
disputed by later scientists. 
</P>
<P>
This chapter is filled with interesting facts about population changes -- that 
older mothers tend to have daughters rather than sons -- and that populations 
that consciously limit family size tend to complete their families while young, 
and thus reduce the average gap between generations. What would he have made of 
the tendency today for late marriages and delayed births, which also result in 
small families but with increased gaps between generations? 
</P>
<P>
Medawar was apparently a charismatic figure, as witnessed in the foreword by 
Lewis Thomas. His inspirational thoughts in "The Life Instinct and Dignity in 
Dying" suggest why he elicited such broad affection. The volume is, inevitably, 
a mixed bag, rich in good scientific storytelling, but also already a 
period-piece, reflecting biases of place and class.

Imagination," edited by D. Michael Shafer (Beacon Press).

Did anyone but me notice that of the 11 bills pending in Sacramento that would 
benefit beleaguered consumers (Part A, Aug. 31), not a single bill was

1 SLAIN, 9 HURT IN RAMPAGE BY FRESNO TEENS

Teen-agers suspected of belonging to street gangs rampaged through this Central 
California city on Sunday night and Monday morning, killing one person and 
wounding at least nine others in a four-hour spree of seemingly random 
shootings across several neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno police officers, though no strangers to gang violence as their 
once-rural city steadily grows more urban, nonetheless appeared startled by the 
uncommonly violent outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't seem to be any identifiable pattern," Police Sgt. Mike Guthrie 
said. "I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity and taking 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Most victims were walking down the sidewalk when they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
The violence ended about 1:30 a.m. Monday when officers arrested four juveniles 
ages 14, 15, 16 and 17 and confiscated five guns. One suspect remained at 
large. Guthrie said there was no indication the youths were high on drugs, but 
crack cocaine was seized from one suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie called the assaults "unprecedented in our city. I can recall nothing of 
this magnitude. . . . There very easily could have been half a dozen or more 
murder victims." 
</P>
<P>
Besides those who were wounded and the one who was killed, bullets were fired 
at seven people, who were not hit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The juveniles in custody officially were being held in connection with eight 
incidents in which the one person was killed and six wounded. Three other 
people were shot in two other incidents, but investigators were uncertain if 
the same assailants were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the rampage began because uniformed officers were conducting 
anti-gang activities Sunday evening in a drug-infested sector of west Fresno 
called "the U," police said. 
</P>
<P>
Five juveniles had intended to commit a drive-by shooting of members of a rival 
gang but left because of the police presence, Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
They committed their first assault at 9:33 p.m. and the killing only moments 
later several blocks away, Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
One juvenile then left the group, and the other four continued robbing and 
assaulting people north seven or eight miles almost to Fresno State University, 
then back toward downtown, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"This entire scenario was an afterthought," Guthrie said, noting that young 
gang members usually stick to shooting other youth gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"But in this case, we have gang members branching out in the community to 
attack non-gang members, and that's highly unusual." 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 350,000 and growing, Fresno long ago outlived its 
long-held image as a sleepy agrarian outpost in the middle of the vast San 
Joaquin Valley. Its population boom, fueled in large part by new arrivals from 
Southern California, has unsettled some longtime residents.

TOURIST KILLED AS GANG MUGS FAMILY IN N.Y.

A young tennis buff visiting New York to watch the U.S. Open was stabbed to 
death on a subway platform when he tried to protect his mother from a gang of 
young muggers, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady was holding the son in her arms with a knife in his chest," a 
bystander said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah, was stabbed once during the robbery Sunday 
evening in midtown Manhattan. He was chasing his family's attackers when he 
collapsed on the subway station platform; he died 40 minutes later at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the family were "huge tennis buffs," a friend said, and the trip to 
the Open at the National Tennis Center in Queens was an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
The family's Mormon bishop, David G. (Doc) Hansen, said Brian Watkins was a 
tennis star at Provo High School and went to Idaho State University on a tennis 
scholarship. In addition, he taught the sport at a club in Provo, where his 
parents, Sherwin and Karen, are ardent tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the family, including son Todd and his wife, Michelle, were waiting 
for a train in the station at 53rd Street and 7th Avenue to go to Tavern on the 
Green in Central Park, just two stops away. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:20 p.m., they were approached by about half a dozen young men, one 
carrying a knife, another a box cutter. They sliced open Sherwin Watkins' pants 
and took a money clip containing about $200 and credit cards, and they punched 
his wife in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Todd and Brian interceded, but one of the men stabbed Brian. 
</P>
<P>
Transit police spokesman Al O'Leary said that, with help from witnesses, police 
tracked two suspects to the Roseland Ballroom just blocks from the subway 
station and recovered a knife believed to be used in the attack. No one had 
been arrested by Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin Watkins was treated at a hospital for a cut to the back of his leg and 
released. His wife was treated for a cut on the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Sandgren, a family friend in Provo, described Brian Watkins as "an easy 
going, soft-spoken guy. He wasn't a violent person. If he was going to get in a 
fight, something would have really had to provoke him."

NASA's third countdown for the space shuttle Columbia and its astronomy mission 
proceeded uninterrupted Monday as the space agency aimed for liftoff Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the shuttle Columbia and the science payload to be right when we 
launch," said Vance Brand, commander of the seven-man crew. "We are 
enthusiastic about the mission and ready to fly it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Columbia takes off, it will be the first shuttle launched since hydrogen 
fuel leaks grounded NASA's three-shuttle fleet in the spring.

SIX KILLED IN COUNTY TRAFFIC OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHWAY DEATHS: MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE DIED IN ROAD ACCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE 
STATE. DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS ARE UP OVER LAST YEAR, THE HIGHWAY PATROL REPORTS.

<P>
Traffic accidents claimed at least six lives in Los Angeles County over the 
Labor Day weekend and caused more than 50 fatalities across the state -- a pace 
that appeared to be slightly greater than last year. 
</P>
<P>
By 6 a.m. Monday, police roadblocks and traffic stops in Los Angeles County had 
already accounted for 547 arrests of suspected drunk drivers. Statewide, a 
California Highway Patrol spokesman reported, there were 2,447 drunk driving 
arrests by Monday morning, compared with the 2,240 arrests made over the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Andy Guitierrez attributed some of the increase in drunk driving 
arrests to a recent lowering of the state's legal blood alcohol limit. In 
January, after a vote by the state Legislature, the legal limit for alcohol in 
a driver's bloodstream dropped from .10% percent to .08%. 
</P>
<P>
Some health officials claimed Monday that abuse of liquor over the holiday 
weekend also was to blame for the increase in fatalities and arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol-related accidents and crimes weighed heavy at the emergency room inside 
California Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles. One nurse estimated that the 
weekend's patient load was 50% higher than on the rest of the year's 
already-busy weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get so many serious injuries, people with problems that aren't as bad 
have to wait," said nurse Scott Aguilar. "That means people with broken bones 
and bad lacerations have to wait five, six hours before we can even start to 
help them." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar and other medical officials gathered in front of the medical center's 
emergency room to decry the latest loss of state funding for Los Angeles 
County's trauma care system and urge passage of a state liquor tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The way things are going now, the system's going to die," said Dr. Michael 
Trainor, an emergency room doctor and president of the state chapter of the 
American College of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were unable to save a 30-year-old Upland man who died about 1 p.m. 
Sunday in Pomona after losing control of his speeding pickup truck on the 
transition road from the southbound Foothill Freeway to the eastbound San 
Bernardino Freeway, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, a car driven by Felipe Hernandez, 20, of Anaheim, ran a 
red light and slammed broadside into another car, killing the unidentified 
driver, about 11 a.m. Sunday. The car then hit two other vehicles, injuring two 
women, and struck a pedestrian, seriously injuring him as well, CHP officers 
said. Hernandez was treated for minor injuries and arrested on suspicion of 
felony manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Moshe Ellerbock, 18, of Pasadena was killed about 3 a.m. Sunday when the car in 
which he was riding hit a street light at Laurel Canyon Boulevard in North 
Hollywood. And Sook Hi Lee, 72, of Sherman Oaks, died after his car went 
through a red light and struck another vehicle while traveling east on Burbank 
Boulevard in Van Nuys, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8:30 p.m. Sunday, a motorcycle hit two parked cars in Southeast 
Los Angeles, killing a 15-year-old passenger and critically injuring the 
driver, Los Angeles police officials said. Earlier the same day, a 26-year-old 
motorcyclist died after he ran a red light at Sunset Boulevard and Vermont 
Avenue, ramming into a passing car. Neither of the two killed was identified by 
police.

MORNING BRIEFING: OK, SO HE'S NOT A WIZARD IN MATH DEPT.

You can still refer to John Wooden as the Wizard of Westwood, but his candidacy 
for the Wizard of Terre Haute recently suffered a minor blemish. 
</P>
<P>
In the Aug. 15 issue of the NCAA News, James M. Van Valkenburg, NCAA director 
of statistics, reported that researcher Gary K. Johnson went over game-by-game 
records of Wooden's two years at Indiana State, 1947-48. Johnson learned that 
although NCAA coaching cards filed by UCLA in the 1950s showed Wooden's Indiana 
State records as 18-7 and 29-7, his actual marks were 17-8 and 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
So Wooden, who won 10 NCAA titles in 27 years at UCLA, has a career record of 
664-162 (not 667-161) for a percentage of .804. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaching records: Johnson's research put a dent in the won-lost record of 
another college basketball coaching legend, Forrest (Phog) Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson found errors in Allen's previously reported records and length of 
service at Baker University, where he began coaching in 1905, and at Central 
Missouri State. There was no change in Allen's 590-219 mark in 39 years at 
Kansas or an earlier stint at Haskell Indian Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's career record was 746-264 (.739), over 48 seasons, not 770-233 (.768) 
over 46. 
</P>
<P>
Last add coaching records: The downward revision dropped Allen from second 
place on the all-time victory list to fourth, behind Adolph Rupp with 875, 
Henry Iba with 767 and Ed Diddle with 759. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do basketball coaches Dean Smith of North Carolina, Ralph 
Miller of Oregon State and Rupp of Kentucky have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Too-deep coverage: Last spring, representatives of Playgirl magazine went to 
Tucson to find subjects for a photo feature titled "Men of Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona defensive back McCann Utu appeared nude in Playgirl's August issue and 
has been ruled ineligible by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Said Utu: "The NCAA says I can't receive any money. But I'm a walk-on. 
(Arizona) is not paying me any money to go to school here. I needed the money. 
Plus the exposure, too." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Athletic Director Bob Bockrath said that Utu was unaware of the NCAA 
rule that prohibits players from capitalizing on their athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
Utu, who still practices with the team, has filed an appeal, but it might be 
academic. On the Wildcats' depth chart, he's listed as a sixth-string 
cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
What's all the fuss?: Friday night, Seattle Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Sr. 
became the first father to play on the same major league team with his son, 
then punctuated the event by throwing out Bo Jackson as he tried to stretch a 
single into a double. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was surprised by his father's throw, Ken Griffey Jr. 
deadpanned: "No. It runs in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Add Griffeys: A family controversy arose after their debut as teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Senior, hitting second, singled in the first inning. Junior, hitting third, 
followed with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Said Junior: "We had a bet on who gets the first hit. But I had a chance to tie 
him, and I did. . . . It doesn't matter. Either way, he's still taking me out 
to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Said Senior: "No, I had the first hit. He said the first hit, and who had the 
first hit?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All three played for Phog Allen at Kansas.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PACIFIC SOUTHWEST EXPECTS UP TO $950,000 IN INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Southwest Corp., a Northridge-based real estate and financial services 
company, said it expects to report net income of between $800,000 and $950,000 
for the fiscal year that ended July 31 on revenue of $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year that ended July 31, 1989, the company lost $71,000 on $2.82 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Fraschilla, Pacific Southwest's president, said the turnaround is due 
mostly to an improved performance by the company's securities portfolio and to 
the receipt of a debt payment in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fraschilla also said Pacific Southwest's over-the-counter stock began trading 
on the National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) 
system.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS REPORTS PROFIT DURING 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House of Fabrics reported a profit of $703,000 in its fiscal second quarter 
that ended July 31, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of $119,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks-based operator of 613 fabric and sewing stores said the 
earnings gain came on an 8% increase in sales, to $87.4 million from $81.3 
million. House of Fabrics said the improvement reflected its shift from 
operating smaller, shopping-mall outlets to large superstores, which has 
increased the company's profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months that ended July 31, House of Fabrics' profit more than 
doubled to $2.86 million from $1.22 million a year earlier, and its six-month 
sales rose 8% to $173.8 million from $160.8 million.

INVESTIGATORS HAUNTED BY MURDERS PAST; 
</P>
<P>
MYSTERIES: UNSOLVED KILLINGS, WHICH NUMBER 111 IN VENTURA COUNTY SINCE 1975, 
STAY ON THE BOOKS AND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' MINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On May 30, 1975, Lynn Mueller, 21, returned home from an evening church service 
in Ventura and called her husband. Two hours later, he found her stabbed to 
death, her head nearly severed from her body. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, 1987, Pedro Pachuca received an emergency phone call at 6 a.m. 
telling him his younger brother had been injured in a car accident. As Pachuca, 
34, rushed out the door of his Santa Paula house, he was shot in the face and 
chest and instantly killed. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 9, 1989, 90-year-old Florence Hackney was found strangled in the 
Fillumore home she had lived in for more than 30 years. A coroner's autopsy 
revealed she was sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
These murders are but three of the estimated 111 homicides since 1975 that 
remain open in Ventura County, according to county law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The tough ones to solve are murders where the body is not immediately found or 
it's a professional killing or it's committed by someone who's carefully 
thought out the crime," said Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. "Those types of 
cases are very difficult to apprehend the killer." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said many of the homicides committed in the county are "self-solving" 
crimes -- those committed in the heat of passion while friends or family 
members are present. 
</P>
<P>
In such "smoking gun" cases, police often are called immediately and find both 
the body and the killer at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Murderers who kill while committing other crimes, such as rape or robbery, also 
tend to leave evidence behind, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact those are solved are not attributable to some kind of Columbo-type 
sleuthing," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
But whodunits are often more intricate puzzles, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
The first 48 hours of an investigation are widely believed to be the most 
important. And after a month goes by, the chances of solving the homicide 
diminish dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"If the case is not solved in 30 days, you've got some serious problems on your 
hands," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Physical evidence is destroyed. Witnesses begin to disperse. People's memories 
dim. And the extra time may give the murderer a chance to intimidate those who 
know something about his crime, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
But those odds do not stop some of the county's top investigators from doggedly 
pursuing cases years, or even decades, after they have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't forget about them," said Cpl. Russ Hayes of the Ventura Police 
Department, one of the original detectives assigned to the Mueller case. 
"They're always there in the back of your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and his former partner, Richard Haas, both of whom have switched 
assignments since Mueller was killed, continue to field tips on the case, keep 
in touch with her family and mull over what they term one of the most brutal 
murders they have ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll call and say, 'Hey Russ, I've got some information on the Mueller 
homicide,' " Hayes said. "I say, 'I'll grab my coat. I'll meet you, and we'll 
do it together.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a 20-year homicide detective now in charge of the Ventura Police 
Department's crime-prevention program, said he still talks to Lynn Mueller's 
father and her husband, who has since remarried. He has searched for her 
tombstone in a local cemetery to pay his respects. And he thinks about the case 
every time he passes the house on Main Street where she was killed or when he 
sees the church she last attended, which has been converted to a wedding 
chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The case has stuck with the two detectives because Lynn Mueller was so innocent 
and her death so brutal, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Haas, who now works as an investigator for the district attorney's office, said 
Mueller was over-killed -- stabbed many more times than was necessary to kill 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still picture that scene in my mind all the time," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was almost decapitated." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of Mueller's death, her 27-year-old husband, Mike, took her to the 
dentist because she had a toothache, Hayes said. After Mike Mueller fixed his 
wife some soup, he left for his job on the swing shift at an oil refinery off 
the Rincon, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Mueller, who was devoutly religious, went next door to a service at a 
Pentecostal church that evening. After returning to her home at 880 E. Main 
St., she called her husband at work and chatted with him for about 15 minutes, 
Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mueller returned home at 12:14 a.m. Failing to find his wife waiting for 
him on the couch, as was her habit, he began searching the house for her. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered his wife of more than three years in the bedroom, dead of 
multiple stab wounds, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mueller called police and went outside to escape the horror in the house. 
But when police arrived, the man, suffering from shock, continued to pace back 
and forth from the house to the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who was a deputy district attorney called to the scene, said he still 
remembers it vividly. 
</P>
<P>
"You could smell the blood from the sidewalk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and Haas began working that night and worked the next 36 hours straight, 
interviewing all the members of the church, the Muellers' neighbors and every 
stranger they could find who happened to be in the area around that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked that and worked it and worked it," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Mueller's parents came to California to meet the detectives and offered a 
$25,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of their only child's killer. They 
finally were forced to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation focused on one individual, who remains a suspect in the case, 
but police never were able to gather enough evidence for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was later convicted of a murder that occurred about a year after 
the Mueller homicide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He is serving a life sentence for the later murder, but he already has come up 
for parole eight times, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
The parole board, which has been given information about the Mueller case, 
withdrew the last parole date it had set, which would have released him at the 
end of this year, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Haas will not give a motive for Mueller's killing, saying only that the suspect 
apparently had known Mueller. But he said the case haunts him each time the man 
comes up for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we have a hunch this is the right suspect, we'd still like 
something to convict him on," Haas said. "Then I can let my mind rest." 
</P>
<P>
Other detectives in the county continue to work unsolved cases for which there 
are no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police said they have no idea why Pedro Pachuca, a labor foreman 
who enjoyed playing soccer on weekends, was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a normal family-type person who worked and went home," said Sgt. 
Mike Saviers of the Santa Paula Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
When Pachuca got the phone call saying his brother Felipe, 26, was hurt, he 
told his wife where he was going and left the house, Saviers said. 
</P>
<P>
He was shot once in the face and once in the torso. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer heard the shots, but by the time he arrived at Pachuca's house 
in the 1500 block of Prieto Street, the gunman was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has any idea," Saviers said. "The brother hadn't been involved in any 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
The murder almost a year ago of Florence Hackney also puzzled sheriff's 
deputies and angered residents of Fillmore's close-knit community of 11,000, 
who said Hackney was well known and liked. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Hackney, who lived alone in the 900 block of Central Avenue, was 
discovered by her daughter, Margaret Haskell, who lives a block away, at 10:55 
p.m. Haskell was checking on her mother after going out to dinner with her 
husband, said Sgt. Tom Odle of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said there was no sign of forced entry into Hackney's home and no 
valuables missing. Odle said detectives have a motive, which is unavailable for 
release, but do not have any concrete suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases can haunt detectives, who may devote years of their lives combing 
through the victims' lives for clues. 
</P>
<P>
The process begins when they are called out, sometimes in the middle of the 
night, to start an investigation. The detectives often do not sleep the next 
two or three days as they try to hunt down leads. 
</P>
<P>
One detective said the first thing he looked for at a murder scene was a cup of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"You are usually awakened in the middle of the night, and you work until you 
drop," said Sgt. Bob Elder, who ran the Oxnard Police Department's homicide 
unit for nine years. "You're on call every minute of every day." 
</P>
<P>
And every aspect of the investigation must stand up to careful court scrutiny, 
Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It means your work and the work of your men must be pristine," Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes of the Ventura Police Department said he constantly worried about 
overlooking a piece of valuable evidence at a crime scene or forgetting to ask 
a question during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to throw away a scrap of paper," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
The information gathered in a case is collected in binders. Many of the 
investigations into whodunits take up volumes. 
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet in his office, Haas keeps 11 three-inch binders detailing the 
Lyman and Charlene Smith homicides, one of the most notorious cases in 
Ventura's history. 
</P>
<P>
On March 17, 1980, Lyman Smith's son went to see his father and stepmother at 
their house in the 500 block of High Point Drive in Ventura. The son lived 
about a mile and a half from his father, who was an attorney up for a 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
He knocked at the door, and when the couple did not answer, the son walked in 
the unlocked front door and found them in bed, where they evidently had been 
bludgeoned to death a couple of days before. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman Smith, 43, and Charlene, 33, apparently were sleeping when someone 
entered the house, which they usually kept locked, Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared the sleeping couple had been beaten to death with a fireplace log. 
</P>
<P>
Their dead bodies were then tied up, perhaps to throw off the investigation by 
making it appear to be a robbery, Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Smith's business associates was arrested and ordered, after a 
preliminary hearing, to stand trial. The district attorney's office 
subsequently decided not to prosecute the case because of insufficient 
evidence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Haas said the investigation took the majority of his time for a year. For years 
afterward, information dribbled in. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators on the case held brainstorming sessions. It is still under 
active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, 1979, Josephina Martinez's boyfriend arrived at her house in Santa 
Paula and discovered that her throat had been slashed sometime the night 
before. Her 1-year-old daughter had trailed blood through the house as she 
played in the puddles of sticky red liquid that oozed from her mother's wound. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up the baby and ran from the house screaming to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concerned neighbors peeked through the screen door and called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Mark Hansen of the Santa Paula Police Department said he went to the 
grisly murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the one who found her lying on the floor with her throat slit in a pool 
of blood," he said. "It was a real gruesome murder." 
</P>
<P>
She had been stabbed in the chest, neck and head nine times. Her throat had 
been cut from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
There were wounds on Martinez's right thumb and palm and her left thumb, 
indicating that the 24-year-old had tried to defend herself from the 
knife-wielding attacker, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
She was last seen alive at 6 p.m. the night before she was found. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend had argued with Martinez, who was unemployed, a couple of days 
before and allegedly left town with another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug paraphernalia was found at the scene of the homicide. Many people 
were interviewed, but no concrete suspects ever developed, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimate she must have been killed sometime during the night, but 
neighbors did not hear anything. All leads were exhausted, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Several suspects also were ruled out in the killing of 20-year-old Rachel 
Zendejas, said Odle, who has been involved in homicide investigations for 18 of 
his 24 years with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 18, 1981, a newspaper deliveryman found the body of Zendejas in front 
of an apartment complex in Camarillo. She had been strangled and raped, Odle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas had gone out drinking and dancing the night before with friends and 
her two brothers. She returned to her apartment building about 3 a.m., Odle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was grabbed there by her murderer, and her body was found at the complex 
across the street. There were no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Odle said he had eight or 10 suspects in the case over the years. All were 
eliminated either because the evidence did not match or they had alibis. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Odle obtained a blood sample from a man in state prison who had been 
a suspect for a while. He also was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Odle, who said the family recently made an effort to have the case included on 
an episode of the television show "Unsolved Mysteries," believes the murderer 
was simply lying in wait for a young woman -- any young woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a particularly heinous crime with an innocent girl on her way 
home from a good time," Odle said. "That should have been solved, and we 
haven't been able to." 
</P>
<P>
He was one of the primary investigators at the time but was transferred after 
working on the case for nine months. When he came back to the department two 
years later, he was reassigned the case, which had never stopped bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
But finding witnesses after nearly 10 years is difficult. People have moved. 
Phones have been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
Odle and other county detectives said they continue to hope that each case will 
be solved. But there comes a point when investigators must turn the bulk of 
their attention to more current affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Other cases become more workable because they're fresher," Odle said. "You 
take the ones you've got a chance of solving, and you work your hardest."

VACATION'S OVER FOR COUNTY'S STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THOSE ENROLLED IN NINE OF THE 20 DISTRICTS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE BACK 
IN CLASS TODAY WHILE OTHERS WILL GET A BRIEF REPRIEVE.

<P>
The first wave of Ventura County students head back to school today, marking 
the end of summer vacation for more than 100,000 schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Students at nine of the county's 20 districts, including Ventura Unified and 
Ojai Unified, will trade their beach gear for schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
For some districts, including Simi Valley, Santa Paula, Moorpark, Hueneme, 
Pleasant Valley in Camarillo and Ocean View in Oxnard, Wednesday will be the 
first day back. 
</P>
<P>
But some county children will get a brief reprieve. Thousand Oaks' Conejo 
Valley Unified School District starts Thursday, while the Oak Park and Oxnard 
Union High School students start back next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, school board members voted last spring to delay the start of the 
school year until Sept. 10 to allow teachers and other district employees to 
take a series of workshops that normally would be scattered throughout the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
In most districts, teachers have already spent several hours a day at their 
schools on their own time, preparing lesson plans and readying classrooms. Many 
districts also had staff meetings last week, which served both as pep rallies 
and goal-setting sessions for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
County Supt. of Schools James F. Cowan said aides for county-run special 
education programs met last week to prepare for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to it," said Cowan, whose staff members coordinate their 
schedules with those of the county districts. 
</P>
<P>
For another 15,000 students, however, today is just another school day. 
</P>
<P>
Those students are on year-round schedules in three districts, including 
Fillmore Unified, where the entire district converted to a year-round calendar 
last month, and Ventura Unified, which has year-round programs at three 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Students at those schools have been in class since the beginning of August and 
are already approaching their first vacation break, scheduled for the first two 
weeks in October. 
</P>
<P>
And while one-fourth of the Oxnard Elementary School District's 12,000 students 
also started classes today, the remainder have been in school on several 
different schedules. Oxnard, the only district in the county that adopted the 
year-round schedule to reduce crowding, has schoolchildren on three different 
calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, school districts are beginning the year with fiscal uncertainty, as 
state education officials prepare for a possible legal battle with Gov. George 
Deukmejian's office over public school funding. 
</P>
<P>
Although money problems have been more austere this year than others, they are 
nothing new, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always in the struggle for money," Cowan said. "But we're optimistic. 
We're getting things geared up and getting ready for a good year."

<P>
HIRING PLAN MAY CUT ENGLISH CLASS SIZES 
</P>

<P>
The size of 10th-grade English classes in Simi Valley could be cut nearly in 
half under a plan scheduled to be considered by school board members Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Using state funds, the district would hire five or six teachers to reduce the 
size of the classes at all three high schools from 36 students to 20 students 
each, Associate Supt. Allan W. Jacobs said. About 1,440 students would be 
affected by the change that could be implemented with substitute teachers on 
the first day of school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $228,000 for teachers' salaries would come from $31 million set 
aside in the 1990-1991 state budget for reducing class size. District officials 
anticipate they will receive $179,500 to $215,700 from the state and that any 
shortage could be made up with state grant money. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said the exact amount of state money will not be known until all school 
districts have a chance to apply for funding. 
</P>
<P>
The size of 10th-grade English classes was expected to jump from about 31 to 36 
students as a result of budget cuts the school board made last spring, which 
included laying off 32 temporary teachers. Seven high school teachers were 
later rehired with surplus payroll funds. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Judy Barry said the smaller classes will enhance learning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled about it," Barry said. "We've been stuck with large class sizes 
for so many years, it's a great opportunity to reduce them. I'm disappointed we 
can't do it in all classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they were pleased with the proposal to add more teachers, 
but vowed to pursue four grievances filed against the district last spring, 
seeking smaller classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Class sizes are still up, and we will be carrying through with the 
grievances," Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Educators Assn., said. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the school board is expected to appoint an interim 
superintendent to run the district after Supt. John Duncan leaves Sept. 16 to 
become superintendent of a Northern California school district. It is estimated 
the interim superintendent will serve for 50 days. STEPHANIE STASSEL

A special Moorpark City Council committee meeting to discuss buying the Casey 
Road site where Moorpark Memorial High School sits will be held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet with the Moorpark Unified School District board to 
consider the sale, which has been the source of a legal battle between the city 
and the school district for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The school district wants to sell the property for development, but the city 
ruled that development would increase traffic in the downtown area. The city 
wants to buy part of the property at a reduced price to build a city park. 
</P>
<P>
The site is now used for a continuation high school. 
</P>
<P>
The public meeting will begin at 4:30 p.m. in the board room of the Moorpark 
Unified School District. LAURA PITTER

A man wearing a knit mask entered Victory Foods, 6935 Linda Vista Road, shortly 
after 6 a.m. Sunday and fired a blast from his shotgun into a wastebasket 
before ordering the store's employees into a back room, police said. 
</P>

The employees said the man took $15,000 to $20,000 and fled on foot, according 
to police.

PLAN FOR GOLF COURSE RAISES WATER FEARS

<P>
The Farmont Corp.'s pursuit of Ventura River water for a proposed golf course 
near Lake Casitas has alarmed small water companies in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Farmont's plan to tap the dry river's underground basin especially threatens 
the Meiners Oaks County Water District, said Ron Singleton, district general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned and we are in opposition to any more well drilling," 
Singleton said. "That basin is running dry. Any more wells will drain it for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The water district relies on four river-bottom wells to serve 5,000 Meiners 
Oaks residents, Singleton said, and it has already felt a drain from pumping 
that Farmont began last year in a formerly inactive well. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want to get into a water war," said Lindsay F. Nielson, a 
Ventura attorney and Farmont spokesman. "There are multiple sources of water 
available for us, but water is obviously a major concern." 
</P>
<P>
The Farmont Corp., formed by Japanese media mogul Kagehisa Toyama, is seeking 
county permits to build an 18-hole golf course on 203 acres west of the Rancho 
Matilija subdivision off California 150. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation owns about 2,000 acres of the Rancho Matilija land grant, 
including half of the dry river bottom and 150 acres of citrus groves along the 
western bank. It also owns the formerly inactive Rancho Matilija Mutual Water

<P>
Two men were robbed within minutes of each other early Monday, and police 
believe that the same man armed with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol may 
have been involved in both crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The first victim told Escondido police that he had gotten out of his car in the 
2300 block of Escondido Boulevard to shop in an all-night mini-market when a 
stocky gunman robbed him of $30. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later another man was stopped by two men in the 2800 block of 
Verda Avenue near the first holdup as he got out of his parked car. The robbers 
demanded money as one held a gun on the victim. He struggled with one of the 
robbers, but his wallet and keys were taken. 
</P>
<P>
In both incidents the suspects drove away in a lowered minivan.

SWIMMERS THROW IN THE TOWEL OVER BAN; 
</P>
<P>
CASTAIC LAKE: RESTRICTIONS DUE TO CONTAMINATION CONCERNS HELP CUT THE HOLIDAY 
CROWD BY 90%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Castaic Lake's beaches were virtually empty this Labor Day weekend and its 
lawns only slightly more crowded, the result of a holiday swimming ban and a 
restriction on the number of weekend visitors to the popular lake. 
</P>
<P>
The measures to limit use of the park, instituted by the county after a water 
test in July and another in August found potentially harmful bacteria in the 
lake's designated swimming areas, succeeded in cutting attendance by about 90% 
on Labor Day, said Charles Graham, the lake's lifeguard chief. Graham estimated 
that 3,000 people visited the lake Monday, compared with about 35,000 on most 
Labor Days. 
</P>
<P>
Windsurfers, paddle boats and canoes still dotted the water Monday on the lower 
part of Castaic Lake, near the swimming areas. But the swimming areas, blocked 
to beach-goers by a line of plastic yellow tape reading "Caution," were empty. 
And the beaches were populated only by a few hardy suntan seekers willing to 
brave the rays without the relief of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Luisa Karapetyan, 16, said she and her parents knew of the swimming ban before 
they came to the lake but were willing nonetheless to pay the $4-per-car 
admission charge. "I can't swim anyway," she said as she sat in near solitude 
in the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
Others were less stoic. "It's too hot to sit down here and not be able to 
swim," Toni DuPont, 39, said as she and a friend packed up their beach towel 
and prepared to leave after two hours in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
DuPont said she did not learn of the swimming ban until after she paid to enter 
the area, parked, and walked down to the shore. "They didn't tell us," she 
said. "They just took our four bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards watching the nearly empty beach said they were less worried Monday 
about drownings, but were concerned about the angry looks directed at them by 
those deterred from jumping in the lake to cool off from the blazing sun. "It's 
a lot easier," said lifeguard Steve Dixon, 22, of Tarzana. "But, you've got to 
kind of watch your back." 
</P>
<P>
The county installed a chain-link fence around the lake a month ago and began 
restricting the number of visitors by prohibiting people from walking into the 
area on weekends free of charge, making the size of the weekend crowd limited 
by the area's 1,500-space parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
County officials also kept the number of weekend swimmers to about 800 to 
reduce bacterial contamination in the lake's shallow areas, said Fred Elam, the 
senior lifeguard in charge of the lower lake. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Department of Health and Department of Parks and Recreation on 
Friday announced a ban on swimming during the traditionally busy Labor Day 
weekend because merely restricting the number of people going into the lake 
would be too difficult, Elam said. 
</P>
<P>
Castaic Lake actually is two bodies of water separated by a dam. The 2,235-acre 
upper lake has 29 miles of shoreline and no swimming areas. The 197-acre lower 
lake has three miles of shoreline, the western half of which is set aside for 
swimming. Boating is permitted on both lakes and was not affected by the 
swimming ban, Elam said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, while stressing that he was not aware of the details of the county's 
August water quality test, suggested that it was a poor indicator of the lake 
water's bacterial content because it was conducted in a shallow area on a day 
when it was especially crowded with swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to say there's not a lake in the whole wide world that would 
pass that test," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials could not be reached Monday for comment. But Curt 
Robertson, a spokesman for the Parks and Recreation Department, said he thought 
health officials were "being extra cautious. That's sort of the way we've been 
approaching this."

<P>
Because of the drought, the county's planning staff may tighten landscape 
guidelines for new developments in the unincorporated areas to encourage water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will ask the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to approve 
revisions in the guidelines followed for commercial, industrial and residential 
developments that include common open space areas. 
</P>
<P>
Possible changes include restricting the use of water-thirsty grass, requiring 
more efficient irrigation equipment and practices, and checking to make sure 
landscaping was installed as called for in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Any changes would be permanent. The staff met with the county's landscape 
architect consultants and members of the Water Conservation Landscape Task 
Force and recommended against tougher temporary restrictions designed to be in 
force until the end of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
If given the go-ahead, the staff would return to the supervisors in February 
with the proposed revisions for their final approval or denial. JANE HULSE

AMTRAK PLATFORM PLANS UNDER REVIEW

<P>
Construction of an Amtrak passenger stop in Ventura could begin as early as 
February, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Redevelopment Administrator Miriam Mack said city engineers are 
reviewing the proposal's final plans, and bids will be solicited as soon as the 
review is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-foot-by-12-foot passenger stop will be located on Harbor Boulevard west 
of Figueroa Street, across from the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said the city's main concern is ensuring that the four- to six-month 
construction does not coincide with next year's Ventura County Fair. She said 
if a bid isn't awarded by January or February, the city could have to delay 
building until the fair is over. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger platform will cost about $500,000, and the city is seeking a 
$250,000 grant from Caltrans to help fund the project, Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak San Diegan, which stops at Santa Barbara and Oxnard, will stop at 
Ventura four times a day when the platform is complete.SCOTT LAWRENCE

RECENT RASH OF 'TAKE-OVER' ROBBERIES MAY BE WORK OF 1 GROUP OF BANDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five "take-over" robberies in the San Fernando Valley since Aug. 20 -- in which 
armed men hold employees and customers of large retail stores at gunpoint -- 
may be the work of one group of suspects, and Los Angeles police are advising 
chain stores of ways to increase security. 
</P>
<P>
All five robberies have occurred at West Valley chain stores with easy freeway 
access. There were no injuries in any of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, between two and five men entered each of the stores near closing 
time, drew guns and herded together employees and any customers still inside, 
police said. The thieves then emptied cash registers and forced managers at 
gunpoint to open safes. They escaped with up to $10,000 in each robbery. Police 
said no suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Police said robberies in which businesses are taken over by gunmen are 
extremely dangerous because of the number of weapons and victims involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't had any take-over robberies for a long time," said Detective Robert 
Johansen of the West Valley Division. "Now all of a sudden we have all of these 
in two weeks. That is our concern. Why the West Valley?" 
</P>
<P>
Police said the five businesses that have been robbed are located close to the 
Ventura or San Diego freeways, and the West Valley is home to numerous retail 
outlets that seem to fit a sketchy pattern favored by the robbers: They are 
open at night, have multiple cash register stations and deal largely in cash 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The first two robberies occurred Aug. 20 on Fallbrook Avenue in Canoga Park. 
Police said two gunmen entered a Liquor Barn in the Fallbrook Square shopping 
center about 8:30 p.m. and held a handful of employees and customers at 
gunpoint while taking an undetermined amount of cash, believed to be several 
hundred dollars, from the registers. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later and only a block away, two gunmen went into a Ralphs 
supermarket and robbed cashiers of about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Two nights later, three armed men held up employees and customers at a Target 
store in the 20800 block of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills. Employees and 
customers were forced to lie on the floor while the robbers roamed the store. 
The cash registers were cleared out, and a manager was forced to open a safe in 
the rear of the store. About $10,000 was taken, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One customer said later that he did not realize a robbery was taking place 
until he walked from the rear to the front of the store to find an open 
register. When he found no cashiers at their stations and asked a manager for 
assistance, the manager whispered that there was a robbery in progress and 
advised the customer to return to the rear of the store. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 27, three robbers struck at the Builders Emporium in the 17600 block of 
Sherman Way in Reseda, taking at gunpoint $10,000 from cash registers and a 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Dave Beeman said the trio had entered the store about 15 minutes before 
closing and appeared to be customers, though one cashier said afterward that 
she thought they behaved suspiciously. One of the men even bought a portable 
phone but later took back the cash he used in the purchase when he rifled the 
register. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we were locking the doors to close, they pulled out the guns," Beeman 
said. "They gathered everybody together and seemed to know how many were in the 
store. They took a head count. One customer tried to run out, but they stopped 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth robbery occurred two nights later at Home Depot on Roscoe Boulevard 
near the Van Nuys Airport. This time, five robbers entered the store, held 10 
employees and customers at gunpoint, and took about $6,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said evidence and descriptions of the suspects and getaway cars link the 
first two robberies. The last three incidents also appear to be linked. 
Detectives assigned to the cases said their hunch is that all five might be the 
work of one group. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies have occurred in roughly the same area that in recent years has 
been plagued by dozens of follow-home holdups and numerous Rolex bandits. In 
the earlier sprees, robbers cruised areas of Ventura Boulevard in the West 
Valley and demanded that owners of Rolex watches give them up, or followed 
luxury cars home and confronted their owners when they stopped. Police 
eventually made arrests that broke up the rings. 
</P>
<P>
Police see no connection between those crime trends and the recent take-over 
robberies. Though no one has been injured, police last week expressed concern 
over the latest series of robberies. 
</P>
<P>
"In any armed robbery, the potential for killing someone is always there," said 
Detective Bud Mehringer, who with Johansen is investigating the first four 
robberies. "But I think that the more bandits and more guns and more victims 
you have, the greater chance there is of bodily harm." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dan Riehl, who is assigned to investigate the fifth robbery, said he 
found the crimes "amazing" because the robbers didn't disguise themselves, took 
numerous people captive and chose stores with numerous aisles and storage 
rooms, increasing the possibility that an uncounted employee or customer might 
stumble into the holdup and be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not your normal stop and rob," Riehl said. "It's very dangerous. There 
are so many witnesses. You have a lot of people running around" in large 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the fact that there are so many businesses in the West Valley 
similar to those that have been hit hampers their efforts to track the robbers 
or thwart their next move. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds and hundreds of stores that have multiple cash registers 
and safes and are near major on-ramps," Mehringer said. "Where do we start? We 
can't narrow it down to one chain or one kind of store." 
</P>
<P>
Mehringer said police have begun to contact the security offices of the chain 
stores to alert them to the robberies. He said the police detectives don't tell 
the private companies how to provide security at their outlets but can suggest 
visible measures such as adding guards. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, spokesmen for the store chains declined to discuss the 
security of their stores. However, Beeman said guards have been added at the 
Builders Emporium that was robbed last week, and Tom Stone, a security 
supervisor for the store chain, said the rash of robberies has gotten the 
attention of large retailers in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Take-over robberies are not unusual in this business, but this many in so 
short a time is," Stone said. "Any retail business in the area would want to be 
looking at security procedures. Now is the time."

Had Dave Winfield been able to script his return to Yankee Stadium, he would 
have written a scene with a thunderous home run to win a tense ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
Walking to start a six-run Angel sixth inning wasn't quite what he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something else," said Winfield, who was showered with 
applause from the crowd of 27,013 in his first visit to his former home since 
the Angels acquired him in May. "I don't think they (the Yankee pitchers) 
wanted to give me much. I was hoping they would." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Angels didn't get much from Tim Leary besides seven walks, they 
made the most of them. First baseman Kevin Maas' throwing error on a fielder's 
choice grounder by Jack Howell in the sixth inning created an opportunity the 
Angels exploited in a 7-0 rout of New York in the opener of their six-game, 
two-city trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you try to play for one run and you catch a break and score six," 
Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "It's hard to predict what's going to happen in 
this game." 
</P>
<P>
Predicting a fine effort by the Angel pitching staff is safe. Kirk McCaskill 
(11-9) and Willie Fraser combined on a four-hitter, with McCaskill facing 19 
batters -- one over the minimum -- in six innings before stiffness in his elbow 
dictated his early exit. Fraser earned his second save of the season with three 
respectable innings, helping the Angels build a streak of 22 2/3 consecutive 
scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
The stretch began with 4 2/3 innings Saturday against Chicago, continued with 
Chuck Finley and Bryan Harvey teaming up in a 1-0 victory over the White Sox 
Sunday and flowed Monday as the Yankees never got a runner past second. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Kelly singled and stole second in the first inning, but McCaskill 
picked him off. McCaskill left Maas on second after he led off the fifth with a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who reduced his earned-run average to 2.85 -- fifth-best in the 
American League -- went to the mound for the seventh inning but left because of 
the discomfort caused by bone spurs in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
If the game had been closer, McCaskill might have stayed in. But with a six-run 
lead, built on three walks off Leary (8-17) and one off relief pitcher Greg 
Caderet, an error, Jack Howell's RBI grounder and singles by Dick Schofield and 
Johnny Ray, tempting fate was senseless. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little something while I was warming up, and I thought this wasn't 
the time to push it," said McCaskill, who attributed the problem to pitching 
the bottom of the sixth after a long wait while the Angels sent 10 men to bat 
in the top of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in pain. It was still very much precautionary. Why push it now when 
I've come this far?" 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Angels recorded consecutive shutouts was in the second and 
third games of the season. Chuck Finley and Mark Eichhorn combined to defeat 
Seattle, 7-0, on April 10, and Mark Langston and Mike Witt pitched a combined 
no-hitter in a 1-0 triumph over the Mariners the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser has allowed only three earned runs in 27 innings over his last 15 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"My role as a setup man isn't a real prestigious role, but it's gratifying when 
you can do your job and keep the team in a game and win one for the starters," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wins and losses are great, but I'd rather the starter get the win. I'm in a 
groove now because Doug's been letting me pitch, and the more chances I get, 
the more I'm able to get in a groove." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees are in a terrible groove, having lost their last five games in 
which they have been outscored, 42-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We stunk the joint out in all phases of the game: offense, defense and 
pitching," Yankee Manager Stump Merrill said. "We have a day off to regroup 
(today), thank God." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield will use his day off today to revisit old haunts and see friends and 
relatives. If his first game back didn't follow the script he would have liked, 
having it end triumphantly was ample consolation. "All I can say is that it was 
good," he said of the reception and the outcome. "I'm just glad we won." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although Manager Doug Rader joked about holding a lengthy workout today, the 
Angels will have the day off. Rader needs it as much as his players, because he 
has been unable to shake a persistent cold. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley, who had experienced stiffness in his left shoulder after his 
start against Texas Aug. 26, has had no similar problems after his 1-0 victory 
over Chicago on Sunday in the finale of the Angel home stand. "Nothing that a 5 
1/2-hour plane ride wouldn't cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, in a one-for-25 slump, has struck out in five of his last seven 
at-bats. . . . Devon White's ninth-inning single was his second hit in 20 
at-bats. . . . Luis Polonia's seven-game hitting streak ended. . . . Johnny Ray 
extended his streak to eight games. He's 12 for 29 (.414) in that span. . . . 
Jack Howell is nine for 24 (.375) since his recall from triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly, idled by back problems since July 25, has 
begun taking batting practice and could return within a week.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
RELAXED REDS RUN INTO BETTER BRAVES, LOSE, 8-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds, relaxed and on a roll, went into Atlanta Monday to play 
the team with the worst record in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
After Mariano Duncan hit a two-run home run and Glenn Braggs one with the bases 
empty in the third inning, the Reds led, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Cincinnati, season-long leaders of the West, had not seen the Braves in 
more than three months and found the club has changed. They found the Braves 
are no longer pushovers. 
</P>
<P>
New faces such as Dave Justice and Francisco Cabrera and some talented young 
pitchers have transformed the Braves into a respectable team. 
</P>
<P>
Justice and Cabrera had key hits as Atlanta knocked out Tom Browning, then 
broke a 6-6 tie on doubles by Andres Thomas and Jeff Blauser for an 8-6 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Mark Grant (2-2) and Jeff Parrett held the Reds scoreless on three 
hits in the last six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the change in this club since Bobby Cox took charge," said Grant, 
who won for the first time since being obtained from San Diego in mid-July. "We 
think we can win." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Doug Drabek (18-5) pitched a four-hitter at 
Pittsburgh to become the league's first 18-game winner. His fifth complete game 
in his last eight starts kept the Pirates within a half-game of first place in 
the East and gave him a 9-1 record since the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek struck out six and -- for the third consecutive game -- did not walk a 
batter. He is 4-0 in his last five starts with an earned-run average of 1.19. 
Drabek is trying to become only the third Pirate 20-game winner in the last 31 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pirate Manager) Jim Leyland doesn't know how lucky he is to have a guy he can 
run out there every five days like Doug Drabek," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva 
said. "He's outstanding. The way he's getting the breaking ball over he might 
be the best pitcher in the league right now." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff King, breaking out of a two-for-21 slump, had two doubles and drove in two 
runs to give Drabek all the support he needed. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, St. Louis 3 -- The Cardinal hitters didn't bother Dwight Gooden at 
St. Louis, but the 96-degree weather did. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden (15-6) gave up six hits in seven innings to earn his 12th victory in his 
last 13 decisions, but he was removed after throwing a couple of warm-up 
pitches in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy to see (Manager) Bud (Harrelson) come out," Gooden said. "I 
was beat. I feel old." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals didn't think he was old. "Gooden was better than good today," 
Manager Joe Torre said. "It seemed that every time he needed it he reached back 
for something extra." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets pounded Bob Tewksbury (9-5) and two relievers for 12 hits, including a 
home run and six doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds hit his 20th home run and had a double, driving in four runs. 
New leadoff hitter Tommy Herr had three hits, including two doubles. Darryl 
Strawberry also had three hits, two of them doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Chicago 2 -- In his second start since surgery, Rick Sutcliffe went 
six innings, giving up five hits and two runs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Expos prevailed in 12 innings at Montreal on Andres Galarraga's with 
the bases loaded. The Cubs intentionally walked .238 hitter Larry Walker to 
load the bases for Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, San Diego 4 -- Tony Gwynn hit into a double play to end the 
game at San Diego, ending the Giants' four-game losing streak and giving Kelly 
Downs his first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had the tying and go-ahead runs on base when Jeff Brantley got Gwynn 
to bounce to second. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
A'S PUT A STOP TO RED SOX STREAK AT 10, 9-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Oakland Athletics face a team threatening to usurp their championship 
laurels, it seems to bring out the best in them. 
</P>
<P>
And Rickey Henderson is usually leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
The left fielder made another pitch for most-valuable-player honors Monday 
night at Boston. The Red Sox built an imposing lead in the American League East 
by winning 10 in a row, and Henderson was ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
He singled to left to open the game and trigger a five-run rally, later hit his 
first home run at Fenway Park and led the Athletics to a 9-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The blow that killed the Red Sox's winning streak and finished Dana Kiecker, 
was a three-run home run by Terry Steinbach with two out that made it 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach and Kiecker are Minnesota neighbors during the off-season and often 
work out together. 
</P>
<P>
On the pitch before he hit his 12th home run, Steinbach fouled a pitch off his 
knee. After circling the bases, he limped off the field and was removed from 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kiecker had a string of scoreless innings ended at 15 when Mark McGwire singled 
with the bases loaded for the first two runs. 
</P>
<P>
For a right-handed hitter, Fenway Park is probably the easiest in the majors to 
hit home runs. But it was not until he hit the 162nd of his career in the 
seventh inning that Henderson hit his first one there. 
</P>
<P>
The home run took the steam out of a Red Sox comeback. A two-run home run by 
former Dodger Mike Marshall cut the lead to 5-3, but they seemed to sink when 
Henderson hit his 24th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Each team lead its division by 6 1/2 games, and the series is being billed as a 
championship preview. Tonight, the Red Sox hope to even it with Roger Clemens 
going for his ninth victory in a row, facing 17-game winner Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Kansas City 2 -- Bobby Thigpen blanked the Royals in the ninth 
inning at Chicago for a record 47th save. 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen, who has a good shot to get 50 or more, broke the record of 46 set by 
Dave Righetti of the New York Yankees in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton Fisk hit a tiebreaking home run in the sixth inning to keep the White 
Sox 6 1/2 games back of Oakland. The blast into the upper deck extended Fisk's 
record for a catcher to 330. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, Toronto 0 -- Joining the Tigers has given the careers of Cecil 
Fielder and Walt Terrell a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
They put a crimp in the Blue Jays' bid for the championship in the East in this 
game at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who joined the Tigers after playing last season in Japan, hit his 
major league-leading 43rd home run, and it was his 113th run batted in, also 
best in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, making an amazing comeback with the Tigers, gave up only four hits in 
seven innings, didn't walk a batter and struck out five. It was his fourth win 
in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, released by Pittsburgh before catching on with the Tigers, is 38-13 at 
Tiger Stadium during his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who had won four in a row, the last Dave Stieb's no-hitter 
Sunday, missed a chance to gain on Boston. They trail by 6 1/2 games with 27 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Cleveland 2 -- The Indians were ripe for consecutive no-hitters at 
Arlington, Tex., but avoided that with two hits in eight innings off Nolan 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb of Toronto held the Indians hitless Sunday. Ryan has six no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
But Candy Maldonado tripled in the fourth inning and Ryan (13-7) had to settle 
for his 302nd victory. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6-9, Milwaukee 0-5 -- For two weeks the Brewers played brilliantly, 
winning 10 of 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the lowly Twins came to Milwaukee and swept a pair. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Guthrie pitched a four-hitter for his first major league shutout in the 
opener, and Shane Mack's three-run double in a five-run ninth won the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie (6-7) struck out five and didn't walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game Rick Aguilera (5-3) gave up the tying run in the eighth, but 
won on Mack's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, Baltimore 2 -- There seems no end in sight to the Orioles' slump. 
Matt Young (7-14) pitched a strong seven innings at Baltimore to hand the 
Orioles their ninth defeat in 10 games and 20th in 27 games. DAN HAFNER

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU'S FOSTER STILL SLOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linebacker Lou Foster returned to practice Monday, but San Diego State Coach Al 
Luginbill said he is not yet at full speed and may not go to Oregon for the 
Aztecs' season opener Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, a 5-feet-11, 230-pound transfer from DeAnza Community College (near San 
Jose), came out of spring practice as the No. 1 inside linebacker but pulled a 
hamstring during conditioning drills before two-a-day practices began Aug. 19 
and did not practice until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to get his confidence back," Luginbill said. "His strength and 
everything tests out right. We worked out with him on the field and then took 
him into the pool and did some hard work with him there. He's got to get his 
confidence back that the (hamstring) is not going to go on him. How long that's 
going to take, I don't know. That's pretty well up to him." 
</P>
<P>
With Foster out, freshman Jamal Duff (6-7, 225) has earned the starting inside 
linebacker job. SCOTT MILLER

CSUN WASTES CHANCES IN SOCCER LOSS TO UCSB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was no shortage of opportunities for the Cal State Northridge soccer team 
Monday night and the Matadors have no one to blame but themselves for a 2-0 
loss to visiting UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN enjoyed a 9-1 corner-kick advantage and an 11-9 edge in shots on goal, but 
still came up short. 
</P>
<P>
"We gotta go back (to practice) and work hard on finishing and playing better 
within 30 yards of the net," CSUN coach Marwan Ass'ad said. "They should be the 
ones who are nervous when we get the ball within 30 yards." 
</P>
<P>
UCSB scored its first goal 18 minutes 45 seconds into the match after a series 
of quick passes allowed Mark Johnson to move into shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
Francois DeJohn started the play with an indirect foul kick from 25 yards. 
Garrett Schwartz attempted to head the ball into the net, but his attempt 
landed at the feet of Johnson, who drilled it in from 10 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our responsibility to clear it the first time," CSUN junior Scott Piri 
said. "We have to be more physical. Once the ball was bouncing around in there 
like a pinball it created an opportunity for them." 
</P>
<P>
With the goal in hand, UCSB Coach Cliff Draeger ordered his troops to sit on 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They put just about everybody back in the penalty area," Piri said. "So many 
times, I'd turn around and they were all in front of me. If we got that one 
goal to tie it, it would have changed the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors had several chances, the best of which came 60:41 into the match 
when Piri, the team's top returning scorer, dribbled around two Gaucho 
defenders and unleashed a high shot from the left corner, 12 yards from the 
goal. But goalkeeper Ryan Sparre thwarted the effort, using all of his 6-foot-3 
height to make a leaping save. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, the Matadors threatened again when freshman Armando 
Valdivia broke loose with only the ball to run down and Sparre to beat. But 
Sparre won, reaching the ball first. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, Northridge launched another attack as Gus Cardenas found teammate 
Ronnie Simpson behind the Gaucho defense. But Cardenas' pass was just beyond 
Simpon's reach. 
</P>
<P>
In the 73rd minute, Cardenas was knocked down in front of the goal and was 
awarded an indirect goal kick. But his shot, around a wall of eight UCSB 
players, was wide of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the gambles CSUN wagered on offense, along with a leg injury 
suffered by defensive anchor Ed Burns, took its toll on defense, and with 6:50 
remaining in the match, UCSB scored again. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Thomas of Ventura did the honors, scoring on a rebound.

THE PREPS: AFTER REALIGNMENT, LOYOLA NO LONGER IN A CLASS BY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the last nine seasons, Los Angeles Loyola has dominated its regular-season 
football competition in compiling a 76-11-1 record. However, critics point out 
that many of the Cubs' victories came against weaker Del Rey League opponents. 
</P>
<P>
This season Loyola will get a chance to silence those skeptics. The Catholic 
Athletic Assn., which oversees league assignments for parochial schools, 
shelved the Del Rey League and moved the Cubs into the powerful Angelus League, 
joining La Puente Bishop Amat, Santa Ana Mater Dei, Bellflower St. John Bosco 
and Anaheim Servite. 
</P>
<P>
So, after winning six Del Rey League titles in nine years over such schools as 
Encino Crespi and Mission Hills Alemany, Loyola is in what area coaches call 
the "super conference." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heck of a league, where all five teams are able to play against most 
anybody around," said Loyola Coach Steve Grady, whose team has reached the 
semifinals in the Division I playoffs the last two seasons. "It is going to be 
a tremendous challenge playing the best every week. One thing for sure is that 
if you do get into the playoffs, you'll know that you've earned your way." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is not the only school affected by the realignment. Santa Fe Springs St. 
Paul and Torrance Bishop Montgomery move from the Angelus League to Division 
III and the newly formed Mission League, joining Alemany, West Hills Chaminade, 
Crespi, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and Playa del Rey St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Cubs in the move from the Del Rey League to the Angelus is St. John 
Bosco. Santa Margarita, which opened in 1987, withdrew from the Angelus League 
in football because its officials felt its program was not ready. The Eagles 
will play an independent schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they wanted the five biggest Catholic schools to play against each 
other," Grady said. "But what will happen is one or two good football teams 
will not get into the playoffs because the league is so tough." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor Grady is not pleased with is the distance Loyola is from its new 
league opponents. Loyola, located near downtown Los Angeles, will have to make 
transportation adjustments. In the Del Rey League, the longest trip was to St. 
John Bosco. Now it's the shortest. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like the move because of the transportation problems created," Grady 
said. "Not so much in football, even though it is tough traveling on the Santa 
Ana Freeway on a Friday night, but in the other sports. Traveling back and 
forth to Servite, Bishop Amat and Mater Dei is going to cut down on our 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably a good decision in creating a super conference. However, I 
would have liked to stay with the people we've been with for so many years like 
Crespi and Alemany. But I don't know if we could take it not being in Division 
I." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Loyola finished with a 10-2 record, losing to San Bernardino San 
Gorgonio in the playoffs, 21-12. With only one starter returning on offense and 
five overall, Loyola will have to rely on senior quarterback Corby Smith, who 
is the son of USC Coach Larry Smith, to direct an inexperienced team. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not have much game experience at quarterback, but he looks good in 
practice," Grady said of the 6-foot-2 Smith, who started at strong safety last 
season. "He is a good team leader who has a good arm with good speed. We need 
to have a good year from him because our line is not as big as in the past, and 
we do lack depth." 
</P>
<P>
This football season marks the first of the 1990-92 Southern Section 
restructuring and playoff-grouping cycle. There are 10 divisions in 11-man 
competition, with Division I making several changes. Along with the loss of the 
Del Rey League, Division I will add the Golden League (moved from Division II) 
and feature revamped Angelus, Citrus Belt and Sunset leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Division II, the San Gabriel Valley and South Coast leagues will replace 
the Bay (moved to Division III) and Golden leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Division VI, the Montview League moves from Division V to replace the 
Suburban League, which moves to Division VII. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Division VII, the Pacific Coast League joins the Suburban and replaces 
the Ocean League, which moves to Division VIII along with the resurrected 
Pioneer League. They replace the Pacific Coast and Santa Fe leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Division IX, the Santa Fe League replaces the Alpha League, which moves 
to Division X. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new Division X will be made up of the Alpha, Arrowhead, Desert-Inyo 
Small and the Freedom leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The first full weekend of the Southern Section football season will begin 
Thursday, but several teams got an early start with games last week in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Seven area teams traveled to Hawaii, and Robert E. Lee of Springfield, Va., 
played host and defeated Westminster, 15-7. Overall, Southern Section teams 
fared well. Five of the seven teams playing in Hawaii won. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Country Canyon had the biggest victory in the Pacific by routing 
Honolulu powerhouse St. Louis, 40-0, to end the Crusaders' 55-game winning 
streak. Crespi defeated Honolulu Kuhuku, 21-14; and Chaminade tied Konawaena 
from the island of Hawaii, 6-6. Southern Section small-school power Van Nuys 
Montclair Prep lost to Honolulu Farrington, 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams were undefeated in their matchups with Hawaiian teams. 
Capistrano Valley defeated Honolulu Damien, 29-15; Huntington Beach defeated 
Honolulu Iolani, 12-0; and Tustin defeated Honolulu Pac-5, 35-7. 
</P>
<P>
City Section football teams begin their season September 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section has denied high school football press credentials to the 
Riverside Press-Enterprise, which last year published stories about on-field 
racial incidents, the Associated Press has reported. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Commissioner Stan Thomas told the newspaper's sports editor 
that the Press-Enterprise would not be issued credentials, thereby denying 
reporters and photographers access to the field and press boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The matter has drawn the attention of the Associated Press Sports Editors, a 
nationwide organization of newspaper sports editors. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas reportedly told sports editor John Garrett last Thursday that he did not 
feel the paper could cover Southern Section teams "fairly and accurately." 
</P>
<P>
According to Garrett, Thomas also voiced objections to the Press-Enterprise's 
use of the state open records law in writing stories about incidents of racial 
slurs being used on football fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is obvious that the real reason for Mr. Thomas' decision is 
his unhappiness with the stories," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps he also wishes to send a message to other newspapers that the CIF 
shouldn't be subjected to the same scrutiny as other public institutions, that 
to do so will result in reprisals." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said he has written the Southern Section's president, asking that 
Thomas be instructed to issue the credentials. Executive Committee President 
Tom Jacobson said Friday that he wanted to talk to Thomas before taking any 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In other fall sports, cross-country also will make changes this season, moving 
to an enrollment-based divisional structure. The state enrollment-based 
championships will have four divisions and the Southern Section will have two 
groupings within each division which is similar to the five-division basketball 
playoffs. The divisions will be labled I-AA (more than 2,550 students), I-A 
(2,550-2,026), II-AA (2,025-1,749), II-A (1,748-1,526), III-AA (1,525-1,249), 
III-A (1,248-901), IV-AA (900-363), IV-A (0-362). 
</P>
<P>
In girls' volleyball, defending state Division I champion Manhattan Beach Mira 
Costa, headed by senior Robin Ortigiesen, is again regarded as the team to beat 
in the 5-A Division. Arcadia, 21-2 last season, is the top team in 4-A, with La 
Habra, Arroyo Grande and Brentwood rated first in 3-A, 2-A and 1A.

NORTH COUNTY BECOMES CENTER OF HIGH-TECH GOLF CLUB PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALEXANDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designers at the research and development facility search for a new exotic 
compound to combat the competition's high polymer resin. Talk of titanium, 
boron and beryllium fills the air as engineers use computers to help them find 
answers to their technical questions. 
</P>
<P>
Modern warfare? No, this is the world of North County's golf club makers. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the lone, wizened Scotsman bent over a work bench hand-crafting a 
niblick fitted with an iron head and a hickory shaft is long gone. Golf clubs 
have entered the age of space and espionage, foreign competition and back-alley 
manufacturing plants. The discussion today is not about persimmon heads, but 
about Luaramid, the high-polymer resin the West Germans use for high-tech gear 
mechanisms and bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
North County is on the crest of this new wave in golf. But it's not because 
there are so many golf courses in the area, but because of the region's 
aerospace industry. The area is the operating base for four of the biggest 
names in golf manufacturing as well as several smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
Shaft maker Aldila, which specializes in boron/graphite club shafts, was begun 
in 1972 by aerospace engineers as a composites and research company. Now based 
in Rancho Bernardo, Aldila is considered a leader in composite club shafts. 
Aldila says its 300 employees can pump out more than 15,000 shafts per day. 
</P>
<P>
Titleist, probably the most famous name in golf, has its U.S. club plant in 
Escondido, employing 110 people. "We have been here since 1967," said John 
Worster, director of western operations for Titleist. "A lot of technology used 
in casting (club heads) comes from the aerospace industry and obviously this is 
the center of that." Titleist's club sales topped $27 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Made has 300 employees at its Carlsbad plant and the company reported 
total domestic sales of $110 million last year. "Taylor Made was founded on the 
basis of the metal wood," said John Steinbach of Taylor Made. 
</P>
<P>
Cobra, a company known for its revolutionary club design, is based in 
Oceanside. It is set to build a new plant on four acres near Palomar Airport 
that will contain a sophisticated research lab. Cobra has attached a Luaramid 
head to a red titanium shaft. That, says John Krone, assistant marketing 
director, is the next step up from metal heads. 
</P>
<P>
Titleist is working on its own innovations. Worster said the company is working 
closely with Mitsubishi Rayon Company of Japan and is 90% through a project 
that will match a graphite shaft to a new club head. "The U.S. government 
trusted them (Mitsubishi) on graphite struts for the FSX fighter, so we can 
trust them too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of all this scrambling, says Krone of Cobra, is to "keep up with the 
Joneses." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the club makers in North County feared that the Joneses had made a 
quantum leap when Japanese player Jumbo Ozaki lent a driver to Jack Nicklaus 
for the Masters tournament in Augusta, Ga. The club was Ozaki's Bridgestone "J" 
Professional Weapon driver. Nicklaus claimed he hit the ball farther -- and 
straighter -- than ever. That's all the club makers had to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done analysis work on those," said Pete Piotrowski, vice president of 
engineering for Aldila. "We need to stay abreast of what's happening, but we 
also looked into it at the behest of some of our customers." 
</P>
<P>
After a months-long search to find out what made the driver special, most 
manufacturers have come to the conclusion: Not much. A Taylor Made ad calls the 
driver "Mumbo Jumbo" since it did not perform any better in tests than previous 
metal-head clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"It caused a big stir, but it is not anything revolutionary," Piotrowski said. 
"Jack Nicklaus hitting the ball further makes it unique. His credibility is 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Piotrowski noted that, at the Memorial tournament that followed the Masters, 
Nicklaus did not use the club. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the perception exists in the minds of passionate golfers that technology 
can solve a bad swing and that perception is fed by the makers themselves. 
Taylor Made's new series of putters, for example, looks like a Klingon weapon 
out of "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
All this makes a ripe environment for industrial espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Made recently issued a statement announcing judgments against 
Mitsushiba, Nassau Investment Casting and Dynascore for counterfeiting its 
clubs. The company is also pursuing several Taiwanese casting houses for making 
unauthorized copies. According to Aldila's Piotrowski, copying occurs all over 
the golf industry, at least partly because so many club makers, like Cobra, for 
example, cast their heads in Taiwan and Japan, where copyright enforcement is a 
sometimes thing. 
</P>
<P>
The companies continue to fight back with more technology and public relations, 
the most important component of which is tour visibility. The thinking goes 
that the more top pros each company can lure into using its clubs, (always for 
a hefty fee), the more average hackers will line up to buy. The companies bank 
on getting their boldly imprinted bags seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
Cobra, which has been short on tour representation, is in the process of 
announcing a deal with superstar Greg Norman, who according to research and 
development director Dick Liesz, will soon become part of the company. Taylor 
Made boasts Mark O'Meara and LPGA champion Patty Sheahan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the public relations campaigns, the research into new clubs 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
Titleist is using a technique called computer-aided face-mapping. This allows 
its engineers to match an impact point on the club face to the flight of the 
ball to determine the shape and size of the optimum hitting area, popularly 
known as the "sweet spot." 
</P>
<P>
Cobra said new materials and manufacturing processes are being attempted all 
the time. "With us being one of the largest users in the country of graphite 
prepreg (raw graphite), there are suppliers at our doorstep all the time with 
new materials," Piotrowski said. He said a computer engineering system 
developed by the aerospace business allows researchers to design a golf shaft 
in minutes, then produce a prototype. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs have advanced so far, there's even a move to look back -- sort of a retro 
golf theory. Titleist's famous Bullseye putter seems to be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of tour pros enamored with the Bullseyes that were made in the 
1950s and '60s," Worster said. "We are going to introduce a line of Bullseyes 
called Classics . . . which is sort of reverse product development." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's no doubt that the push by North County's golf club makers will 
be strongly forward. In the future, the club makers say, scientific minds that 
have been dedicated to military research may be redirected in a new area -- 
building a better golf club.

STRANGERS AT A STRANGE CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN, (Sue Martin is a Times editorial assistant in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was business as unusual over the Labor Day weekend at Golden Hall and the 
Omni Hotel as sci-fi fans beamed in in all their eccentric glory. 
</P>
<P>
In case you were out of town or off the planet, the North American Science 
Fiction Convention began Thursday and ended Monday, providing a place for 2,000 
science fiction fans to get together and discuss (in great detail and at all 
hours of the night) their love of Japanese animation, Celtic myths, Batman, 
computer games and, of course, "Star Trek" in all its permutations. 
</P>
<P>
The piece de resistance, however, had to be the Saturday masquerade at the 
Civic Theatre, where 500 or so of the conventioneers cheered and applauded 
appreciatively the pluck and imagination of the 24 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
The craftsmanship of the costumes ranged from spectacular construction and 
detail to the relatively straightforward and simple. 
</P>
<P>
In the simple and clever presentation, "The Duct Tape Mummy and his 
Fashion-Conscious Sister, Sticky" were Craig Kozeluh, 12, and his sister Carla, 
9, of Santee. Craig came up with the idea of wrapping a great deal of duct tape 
around himself mummy style, with Carla sporting a skirt made of bands of yellow 
and red tape. 
</P>
<P>
In the more complicated and involved category, there was the 18th-Century group 
that looked as though it had just stepped out of a Watteau painting. Maryeileen 
McKersie, Kit Townsend, Gail Wolfenden-Steib and William Law were a symphony of 
ribbon and satin, white faces, wigs, lace and coquettishly used fans. 
</P>
<P>
Other entrants included a group re-creating a rescue from the film "Aliens II" 
and two Klingons from the "Star Trek" movies. All of the costumes were 
handmade. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought Mardi Gras was colorful. 
</P>
<P>
But the parade wasn't over when the curtain fell at the Civic. More costumes 
came out of hotel rooms and mingled with the "normal" people. Some strolled 
across Broadway to the amazement of people on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabethan ladies in Renaissance finery, English peasants, members of 
"Starfleet (the Next Generation)," pointy-eared elves and others could be seen 
promenading down the halls in search of parties, or rock 'n' rolling in one of 
the ballrooms. 
</P>
<P>
These fans of the fantastic -- though frequently perceived as slaves to 
blockbuster films and television -- are primarily hoarders of the printed word. 
They are happy spending hours poring over the latest publications and books 
from their favorite writers, as well as searching for that one vintage Robert 
A. Heinlein novel to complete their collection. 
</P>
<P>
Science fiction fans court and cherish the colorful and the exhibitionist, the 
awkward and the lonely. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Schmitz of San Diego, who enters data for a living, sees this as a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of people who find conventions liberating because they're among 
like-minded people," he said. "They are socially awkward and bookish, and they 
feel more comfortable here. This is also a place for intellectual stimulation, 
a real marketplace for ideas." 
</P>
<P>
John Tripp and his wife, Sheila, of San Diego came to the convention out of 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been reading science fiction for years," he said. "This is the first time 
I've come to a place where I could see science fiction writers and listen to 
them talk." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila agreed, adding: "I'm also overwhelmed by the myriad of books and things 
for sale and the fact that people don't mind walking in public in costumes. I 
admire that." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo and Nebula award-winning author Samuel (Chip) Delany ("Dhalgren," 
"Babel-17") was the convention's official guest of honor. At a talk Saturday, 
he called science fiction fandom a healthy phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to writers in other fields who don't believe me," he said. "They aren't 
used to audiences being real, outside the odd college reading. The 
reader-writer relationship in science fiction is the healthiest thing about 
fandom." 
</P>
<P>
Business is also healthy. The dealer's room at Golden Hall provided new and 
used goods to part the willing from a goodly amount of their cash. 
</P>
<P>
The wares included swords, useful for wielding against dragons or barbarians; 
crystals for gazing into or wearing; "Star Trek" phasers; photos of Mel Gibson; 
comics; jewelry and books -- old, new, rare and dog-eared. 
</P>
<P>
Besides books, two of the most popular items are T-shirts and badges. These 
identify one's loyalties and interestes clearly and easily: "The lunatic fringe 
begins here." "Teacher from the Black Lagoon." "Reality is for those who can't 
handle science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
An art show displayed galaxies portrayed through a multitude of techniques: 
watercolors of princes and unicorns, sculptures of dragons and oil and acrylic 
paintings of space and space ships. Prices ranged from a few dollars for 
cartoons based on popular TV shows to hundreds of dollars for original book 
cover art. 
</P>
<P>
Panel discussions provided forums for authors, publishers and editors to reveal 
an inside view of their professions. The panels were also a sounding board for 
topics such as weapons, space travel, science fiction on television, even 
previous conventions. 
</P>
<P>
One panel carried a title that couldn't be ignored. The session included an 
author and book editor describing unusual forms of revenge in the publishing 
world, and a Cal Tech scientist who described how to simulate Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's name? "Jell-O and the Uses of Terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Beam me up, Scotty.

CHICAGO'S 2ND ORCHESTRA LEADS WAY WITH MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the competition for public funding, mainstream arts organizations have come 
under increasing pressure to improve their dismal record of minority 
involvement. From personnel to programming to representation on governing 
boards, government agencies such as the California Arts Council are requiring 
orchestras and opera companies, for example, to demonstrate a more inclusive 
racial mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra conductor Paul Freeman, in town to lead a pair of San Diego Symphony 
summers pops concerts this week, could give a seminar on this topic. He 
organized his Chicago Sinfonietta to be racially inclusive from its inception, 
rather than worrying about minority involvement after the fact. After 
conducting one of Chicago's Grant Park concerts in 1986, Freeman was invited by 
local leaders to start a chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them what I wanted to do -- to scout out the top minority talent in the 
Chicago area," he explained. "My goal was to make at least a third of the 
orchestra composed of minority musicians, but we were equally careful to 
articulate that the orchestra's social mission is secondary to its musical 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
In a Chicago Tribune commentary last fall, music critic John von Rhein 
described Freeman's Chicago Sinfonietta as "the city's mid-sized, 
affirmative-action, community-outreach orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
When Freeman started the Chicago Sinfonietta in 1987, he was music director of 
Canada's Victoria Symphony and principal guest conductor of the Helsinki 
Philharmonic. It was the political chemistry of Chicago at that time that 
encouraged him to set down musical roots in yet another city far from his home 
in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a certain vibrancy in the air then, especially during the 
administration of (the late Chicago mayor) Harold Washington." 
</P>
<P>
In three short years, Freeman has achieved many of his musical and social 
goals. Chicago Sun-Times music critic Paul Marsh dubbed the young Chicago 
Sinfonietta, "Chicago's second orchestra," a distinction of no small stature: 
Several Chicago area musical ensembles vie to be ranked adjacent to Sir Georg 
Solti's Chicago Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman is equally pleased about his orchestra's racial mixture of black, 
white, Asian and Latino players.

"With 30% of our 40 musicians minority, I think we're a model orchestra. The 
membership of our board is also 40% minority. Some orchestra directors ask me 
what they can do for community outreach and minority participation -- we have 
that built in our orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Another musical project close to Freeman's heart is a series of nine recordings 
he made for Columbia Records of works by black composers. Although the 
four-year project was completed about 15 years ago, Freeman stated that its 
benefits are still being felt. Especially for conductors who knew nothing of 
the works of Chevalier St. George, William Grant Still, Ulysses S. Kay, the 
recordings provided a crash course in orchestral repertory left out of the 
orchestra canon largely because of the composers' race. 
</P>
<P>
"Many conductors have used music from the series in their programming. And, for 
the (living) composers represented in the series it has been a tremendous 
thrust. George Walker, for example, received a commission from (conductor 
Lorin) Maazel in Cleveland and then another commission from the New York 
Philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman noted that the idea for undertaking the Columbia recording project came 
from Robert Shaw, who was sharing the podium with Freeman at a conference on 
black music at Atlanta's Spelman College. Shaw, at that time the Atlanta 
Symphony's music director, was appointed principal guest conductor to the San 
Diego Symphony last year. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman has not put all of his eggs in the Chicago basket, however. Earlier 
this year, he was appointed principal guest conductor of the Zagreb, 
Yugoslavia, Symphony Orchestra. One of his main duties with the Zagreb Symphony 
is to make recordings. Before he flew to San Diego for his all-Tchaikovsky 
assignment with the San Diego Symphony, Freeman was in Zagreb recording works 
by Beethoven, Bloch and Shostakovich. And by the black American composer Hale 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are opening up in European countries musically," said Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
And, if the activist conductor continues to have his way, other doors will be 
opening in this country, too.

Time to subscribe. San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell will take over 
the KFSD-FM (94.1) air waves from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday to solicit subscriptions 
to the opera's upcoming season. As listeners call in their subscriptions, 
Campbell will play recorded arias and selections from the five operas the 
company will present at the Civic Theatre from January to May next year.

South Bay music. For several seasons, the Chula Vista public library has 
offered a commendable series of free chamber music concerts in its F Street 
auditorium. Last week, the library announced its fall series, beginning with a 
vocal recital by soprano Ann DeVries and baritone Martin Wright on Sept. 17. 
The Gennaro Trio (violinist Ronald Goldman, cellist Mary Lindblom and pianist 
Ilana Mysior will perform Oct. 15, and the brass quintet Classic Brass will 
complete the fall term Nov. 19.

Opening the show for Paul Rodriguez was Tom Martin, an Orange County comic with 
a soft style and easy flow. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some examples of why he is worth catching: 
</P>
<P>
He is out to dinner with his family and orders a grilled cheese sandwich, only 
to be admonished by his mother and told to get something he can't get at home. 
In that case, "I'll have some understanding and compassion, please."

Talking about how messy he and his college roommate were, he says: "The

RULING MAY LET SCHABARUM STAY ON BOARD INDEFINITELY; 
</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: SUPERVISOR SAYS HE'LL REMAIN UNTIL APPEALS PROCESS IS OVER AND 
AN ELECTION IS HELD. NO ONE KNOWS HOW LONG THAT COULD BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who planned to retire in December, says he will stay 
on the board as long as it takes a federal appeals court to review a lower 
court ruling that Los Angeles County's political map discriminates against 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said through a spokesman last week that he plans to stay on the 
county Board of Supervisors "until the appeals process is completed and an 
election is held." 
</P>
<P>
How long that may be is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he likes it or not, the man who said his job is not "as much fun as 
other things," now finds that his term could be extended up to a year, maybe 
longer -- without a single ballot being cast. 
</P>
<P>
The open-ended stay on the board comes to Schabarum, 61, courtesy of the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which last month indefinitely postponed the 1st 
District election pending a review of new district boundaries approved by U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon. In June, Kenyon ruled that the current lines 
discriminated against Latinos and approved a new map that changed political 
representation for many of the county's 8.5 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling has left the county's political landscape in disarray, 
upsetting the election plans of current and prospective candidates for 
Schabarum's seat and giving Schabarum another chance to exasperate colleagues 
who want him to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Under the appeals court ruling, Schabarum, whose term expires at noon Dec. 3, 
will continue to serve until his successor is appointed or elected. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Flores, whose campaign to succeed Schabarum has been left in limbo by the 
case, made a last-ditch plea Friday to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to 
allow the November runoff between her and Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien 
to proceed. Kenyon had canceled the runoff and ordered a new primary in a 
redrawn 1st District, but the appeals court called off both elections. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Flores complained that the uncertainty surrounding the 
election has hurt her campaign to become the first Latino elected to the board 
in 115 years. Since the runoff was canceled, she has raised "virtually 
nothing," she said, adding that her campaign "can die on the vine if we lose 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Flores' attorney, Thomas Bourke, argued that preliminary census figures made 
public last week raise questions about the reliability of county population 
estimates used for drawing new district boundaries. County estimates are higher 
than the preliminary census figures, and the differences show that any 
redistricting should be delayed until final census figures are available next 
year, Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials said the Nov. 6 runoff can still be held if the court acts 
by Sept. 12. A runoff can be held within 42 days of the court's ruling. County 
officials said a new primary could be held in March, but plaintiffs' attorneys 
say it could be held in December or January. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fajardo, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, a plaintiff, said it would be wrong to delay redistricting 
until final census figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to give the Hispanic community that has been wronged 
for so long an opportunity to have an election as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, however, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is not scheduled to 
take up the case until October. But an expected appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court could leave the supervisors' districts unsettled, and Schabarum in office 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, who has bought a retirement home near Palm Springs, moved closer to 
closing the door on the possibility that he could run in a new 1st District. 
"As of today, he has no intention of running," Schabarum spokeswoman Judy 
Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year incumbent, however, was less clear when contacted later. "There is 
no election before us," he said. "It's too early." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Schabarum privately discussed resigning, but only if he 
could have a say in who replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of these guys would love to see me go," Schabarum said recently, 
gesturing to his Republican colleagues, Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich, whom 
Schabarum has derisively referred to as "alleged conservatives." "But it's not 
in the cards right now," Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has said he will serve until a successor is elected, Schabarum 
could leave office anytime. In that case, Gov. George Deukmejian or his 
successor could appoint a new supervisor until an election is held. 
</P>
<P>
But those close to Schabarum said they doubt he will resign because the 
supervisor does not appear able to choose his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum considered resigning as early as February, his aides said, but only 
if he could persuade the governor to replace him with his hand-picked successor 
-- O'Brien. But state law prohibits judges from accepting political 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich and Dana said they believe Deukmejian would appoint Flores if 
Schabarum stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office will not comment on private discussions concerning 
political appointments, said Deukmejian spokesman Robert J. Gore. 
</P>
<P>
But a source familiar with the governor's office said, even if O'Brien had been 
eligible for appointment, such a deal would have been highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be out of character if the governor agreed to some kind of deal," the 
source said. "And Schabarum and the governor have never been particularly 
close." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court action leaves several candidates in political limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre asked his lawyers whether he could 
begin to raise money to run for the Board of Supervisors, but was advised that 
he cannot form a fund-raising committee until the district lines are final, 
said Robin Kramer, an aide to the the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Under campaign finance laws "you can't raise funds for a seat that doesn't 
exist," Kramer said. "The seat is still out there in the nether world." 
</P>
<P>
So uncertain is the county's political picture that Flores has begun 
campaigning in both the current and the redrawn 1st districts, which only have 
half of their territory in common. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and O'Brien said they are struggling to maintain interest in their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The election delay has been a financial burden as well. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who mortgaged her Glendora home to help finance her campaign, owes 
about $60,000 for her legal battle. She and O'Brien are on unpaid leave from 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to hold on as long as we possibly can," said Flores, who has been 
on an unpaid leave of absence from her county job since March. "I'm committed, 
even if I have to take in laundry." 
</P>
<P>
Without his $94,344 yearly salary as a Superior Court judge, O'Brien said his 
family's finances are "really getting stretched out thin." His wife Carolyn 
recently went back to work in the personnel department of a supermarket chain, 
and the O'Briens had intended to use her salary to help pay for the schooling 
of their daughter, Kelly, at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that money is just providing a subsistence income for the family," O'Brien 
said.

CONTRACTS HELP BIND WOUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: ONLY AFTER ANOTHER SET OF INJURIES DOES CLUB DECIDE TO SIGN GREENE, 
STEWART AND REED IN PREPARATION FOR OPENER AGAINST GREEN BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As linebacker Kevin Greene, safety Michael Stewart and defensive end Doug Reed 
proved this week, the key to getting contract work done with the Rams is 
waiting until the team is on the verge of medical collapse. 
</P>
<P>
That was confirmed last Friday night in Washington, where some of the few 
healthy bodies the Rams had remaining were left strewn on the field at RFK 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a summer of hope and hype has pretty much ended in flames, with 
the team some considered the second-best in football trying to figure out how 
it is going to beat a Green Bay team that won't have quarterback Don Majkowksi 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers? A moment of silence, please as the Rams probably are 
thankful these teams aren't paired until Nov. 25. Anything earlier and you 
start thinking about Custer. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Not playing defense, unfortunately. Training camp started with a few seemingly 
harmless hamstring pulls and ended in a string of slings and surgeries, 
postponing for now some Tampa Bay party plans. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Rams had big plans on defense this season. Cornerback Jerry 
Gray, playing out of position for five years, some say, was returning to free 
safety to assume the role of a Ronnie Lott, master of secondaries in San 
Francisco. Darryl Henley, a second-year man from UCLA, would join veteran Bobby 
Humphery on the corners. Alfred Jackson, a talent on the rise, was first corner 
in off the bench. It was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Their five-linebacker Eagle defense having run its course after two seasons, 
the Rams were once again tinkering, combining the Eagle with their old 3-4 to 
form a new alignment. This was going to be the year for second-year rushmen 
Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith, each 6-feet-6, who might terrorize quarterbacks 
when paired with Greene, who has more sacks the last two years, 33, than any 
other NFL player. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the unraveling. It started with Henley, who first injured his hip a 
month ago and is sidelined indefinitely. That forced Coach John Robinson to 
move Gray back to corner. Brian Smith suffered a sprained knee and was 
sidelined for three weeks. He is back now, but to what degree? 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins still hasn't recovered from knee surgery performed in December. The 
team moved him to the strong side position, where Reed was a summerlong holdout 
and Mike Piel was working with a brace on his left elbow, the result of two 
dislocations last season. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Washington and a meaningless exhibition game during which Gray and 
Jackson collided in the end zone. Gray had knee surgery the next day; Jackson 
was rolled off the field on a stretcher, suffering from a torn groin muscle. 
That took care of three-fourths of the team's cornerbacks, Gray and Jackson 
joining Henley on the trainer's table. Latin Berry, a fullback at Oregon last 
year, jumped into the game and took on receiver Ricky Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same game, inside linebacker Larry Kelm, who calls defensive 
signals, suffered an injured left knee. He took a table next to Gray the next 
day at Centinela Hospital Medical Center. His backup, Mel Owens, has been flat 
on his back for two weeks because of a back injury and was released Tuesday, 
his future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Until Reed agreed to terms Monday, the Rams had four healthy defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, before the Washington injuries, Robinson said the team would 
continue with its defensive plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We like what we're doing, so we're proceeding," Robinson said. "Our design has 
not changed. We will emphasize the pass rush more. One thing that has happened 
is that Bill Hawkins has not been able to do much from a pass-rush standpoint. 
The leg allows him to play effectively on the line. He just isn't quite the 
pass rusher right now. But Brian Smith has been, and he's back now." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams finished 21st overall last season on defense, 28th against the pass. 
Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who patched together a defense that 
managed to survive two playoff rounds in 1989, needs another miracle to keep 
the Rams in the race until some of his troops return. 
</P>
<P>
What about the offense? In four exhibitions, the Rams' top three receivers -- 
Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox -- totaled one reception. All had 
pulled hamstrings. Remember, this is a passing offense that relies on precision 
and timing, something achieved through practice -- something the Ram receivers 
haven't been able to do. 
</P>
<P>
The team's leading receiver this summer, with nine catches, was free agent 
Derrick Faison, who used the opportunity to make the opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
The race for starting tailback was expected to be a heated one involving 
newcomer Curt Warner and former first-round picks Gaston Green and Cleveland 
Gary. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminate Gary for now. He didn't play a down because of a lower back strain. 
The veteran Warner was used only enough this summer (26 carries) to make him 
difficult to evaluate. Robinson says Warner hasn't lost a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Curt needs that many (carries) to be ready," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves Green, the man the team couldn't give away for draft choices a few 
months ago. He led all rushers with 217 yards which, based on production, 
should warrant a starting assignment this Sunday. But against the Redskins last 
week, Green gained only 10 yards and had a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams needed a 200-yard performance from Greg Bell in last season's finale 
to keep their string of 1,000-yard rushers at seven in a row in the Robinson 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"I see us rushing for more yards than last year. A 1,000-yard rusher has never 
been a thing for me," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The stat I look at is the success of our running game. Other people equate it 
to a person. I don't think we ever have. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at the offensive line, the tight ends, the running backs. I think 
we're going to have some 1,000-yard blockers." 
</P>

DESPITE THE EXAMPLE SET BY 49ERS, SOME NFL OWNERS INSIST THAT TITLES CAN'T BE

<P>
Matt Millen was flying high. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, shortly before last season's opener, the linebacker was cut 
by the Raiders after nine years. Now he was on a plane back to Los Angeles from 
his Pennsylvania home at the invitation of the other team in town. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Anaheim, Millen, 31, felt as if he landed in Fantasyland. In a 
week, he went from unwanted to invaluable. The Rams liked what they saw when 
they worked him out. With linebackers Fred Strickland and Larry Kelm injured, 
Millen could be plugged right in as a starter, he was told. He would be their 
nose linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Only one problem. 
</P>
<P>
Ram economics being what they are, Millen was informed he couldn't expect the 
same $450,000 he was paid by the Raiders. The highest the Rams would go was 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Millen was still willing to sign. But, he figured, to be fair to himself, he 
first would hop up to San Francisco to talk to the 49ers, who also expressed 
some interest. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Rams, the 49ers didn't have a spot open. They weren't sure how much 
Millen would play. But they were willing to pay him the full $450,000 even 
though one game had already been played. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Hello Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, linebacker Jim Fahnhorst suffered a broken arm, Millen became 
a starter and helped the 49ers again get past the Rams, their arch division 
rivals, en route to another Super Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
Again, an image was reinforced: The bottom line for the Rams is money. The 
bottom line for the 49ers is winning. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rams will heatedly argue their side of that image, there is no 
argument about the 49ers. They are the exception to the NFL rule, exceptional 
on the field where winning games is everything. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco won four Super Bowls in the 1980s, including the last two. 
However, backed by owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., a billionaire shopping-mall 
magnate, the team reportedly has lost about $20 million in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
In today's economic climate in the NFL, with clubs playing to more than 90% 
capacity, a 60-40 split of the live gate between the teams and shared revenue 
in everything from telecast money to NFL properties, does it pay for any club 
to spend big bucks to produce a winner? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous difference between football and baseball," said Stephen 
Ross, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois law school. "With 
just eight (home) games, most football teams sell out most of their games even 
if they are mediocre. So, there is no financial motive for success. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, (several) years ago, Walter Payton was a free agent. Nobody made 
an effort to sign him even though, at the time, he was at the peak of his 
ability. The reason was, they would have had to sign him to a huge salary 
increase that wouldn't be reflected with an increase in revenues. If all home 
games are sellouts, and the broadcast revenue they get is the same whether they 
are 16-0 or 0-16, why spend money to improve the team? 
</P>
<P>
"When Pete Rose became a free agent (a decade ago) and was signed by the 
Phillies, they gave him a big salary, but that was immediately reflected in 
higher advertising rates for radio and an increase in season-ticket sales. That 
is not going to happen in football." 
</P>
<P>
Art Modell, who has owned the Cleveland Browns for nearly 30 years and is still 
waiting to go to his first Super Bowl, doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsensical," Modell said. "There's no validity to it. This is just 
another myth perpetrated. Any owner who doesn't want to win should get the hell 
out. There is no amount I wouldn't fill in on a check to get into a Super Bowl. 
I couldn't put a price tag on what it would mean. We are so overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Modell has an ally in Will McDonough, long-time Boston Globe sportswriter and 
television analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that there is no motivation to win is totally a farce," McDonough 
said. "I've been around the game 30 years, and I haven't known one owner who 
did not want to win." 
</P>
<P>
No argument from Joel Buchsbaum, associate editor of Pro Football Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think they try everything to win," he said. "That's the reason 
owners are giving out big contracts and signing Plan B guys to big amounts that 
are getting ridiculous. You are dealing with 28 big egos, and they all want to 
be No. 1. The bottom line is completely the won-and-lost record with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some clubs are more realistic financially and don't want to lose $5 million a 
year. They back the bottom line more heavily than other clubs do. The 
(Cincinnati) Bengals got to the Super Bowl and were one play away from winning 
it. And who's more bottom-line conscious than the Bengals? Who knows more about 
football than (General Manager) Paul Brown?" 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, according to Buchsbaum, is not always a straight line, either. 
A bottom line on salaries is not necessarily the same thing as a bottom line on 
expenses. 
</P>

"(New York Giant General Manager) George Young didn't want to give Lawrence 
Taylor $2 million, but they are not a bottom-line team," Buchsbaum said. "When 
Karl Nelson got cancer, no expense was spared, including hiring a limo to bring 
his wife to the hospital. Same kind of thing when Dan Lloyd and John Tuggle got 
sick. Everything that could have been done was done. When others had drug 
problems, rehab was paid for even though they knew they were going to have to 
let some of those people go. 
</P>
<P>
"Clubs are cheap in certain areas. They show bad judgment, don't know how to 
treat people in certain cases, but the overriding factor is the big ego and the 
desire to win." 
</P>
<P>
Modell concedes that should he ever win it all, he is not expecting a pot of 
gold at the end of his Super Bowl rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no great financial reward for winning," he said. "The difference 
between football and, say, baseball or basketball is the frequency of play. We 
play 16 games compared to 162 in baseball. If Nolan Ryan pitches in Milwaukee, 
they may sell out. Or they may go from a crowd of 18,000 to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Take the Minnesota Twins. They won the World Series and went from 2 million to 
3 million (attendance). We don't have that. Winning may translate into a small 
reward the next year for us. The following year, there might be a difference in 
season-ticket sales, up or down. You might raise ticket prices or get a bigger 
radio contract. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is not much of a financial gain from the Super Bowl. There is no 
reward in winning. The reward is the glory of winning." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does Modell buy the theory that being an NFL owner automatically means 
opening the stadium gates and watching the money flow through. 
</P>
<P>
"Most NFL teams in recent years have been losing money," Modell said. "You 
can't forecast what is going to happen, despite the TV contracts. The idea 
everyone is making money is a fallacious bit of propaganda put out by the 
players association. The player salaries keep going up and up, with no end in 
sight. The Browns have been marginally profitable or a loser for years. We are 
usually hovering around the break-even point. That's the cost of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
NFL teams losing money? Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the NFL 
Players Assn., disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That's poppycock," Allen said. "They have just negotiated a TV contract that 
raises every team from $17 million to an average of $34 million over four 
years. And that's not counting gate receipts, luxury boxes, money from NFL 
Films. 
</P>
<P>
"The money from NFL Properties alone is now in excess of $50 million. The 
owners have increased their total revenue 50%. It's corporate socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"They are developing new markets in Japan and Europe. They are exploring 
corporate ownership of teams. They are discussing expansion, which would bring 
in expansion fees. I don't think anyone believes they are losing money. We 
think every team in the NFL is making money. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's not only what their net profit in a year is. It's the appreciation of 
a team's value. You're talking about a tremendous amount over the last five, 
10, 15 years. We think the average team is now worth in the neighborhood of 
$100 million." 
</P>
<P>
According to the players association, clubs will bring in an average of $5 
million a year from sources other than national TV in each of the next four 
seasons. Add to that the TV money and the total is $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
The players association estimates that clubs will spend an average of $14.5 
million this year on non-player costs, that figure rising to $21 million by 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have the top payroll in the league, $19.6 million, a figure 
guaranteed to increase by 1993. Add to that the $21 million in costs and the 
total is about $40 million, about the same as the revenue figure, meaning a 
break-even situation. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, an impartial observer, thinks the won-lost record on the ledger, much 
like on the field, comes down to a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual profit-loss statements are meaningless because of tax factors and 
other factors involved," he said. "It's an accounting nightmare that is just 
not very meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
"The key test as to whether teams are profitable is when they are sold, what 
are they going for? Only an idiot pays millions more for a property than the 
previous buyer when it is a money-losing proposition. If franchises were losing 
money, you would see a decline in what they are sold for. If they were losing 
money, the owners would be selling for less than they sold for in the past. If 
that happened, you could say football was in trouble. But that is clearly not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Profit and loss, according to McDonough, comes down to individual philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Chicago) Bears and the Bengals make money and they'll be proud to tell 
you that," he said. "Some owners are smart enough to make money even if they 
finish last. The reason most lose money is that they are overspending, trying 
to get a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Allen sees a direct correlation between paying well and playing well. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest-paying teams are usually the winning teams," he said. "It's no 
accident that Tampa Bay has one of lowest payrolls in the league. The way the 
system works, it costs you money to win by having a higher payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we don't want to suggest that an owner can necessarily buy dominance. 
George Steinbrenner tried that in baseball and it didn't work. You have to 
spend wisely, not just spend to spend." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings the argument back to San Francisco. Has DeBartolo bought a dynasty 
or merely rewarded one? Did he have to empty his pockets to fill his trophy 
case? 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo, under investigation by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for putting 
the 49ers under his corporate umbrella, refused to comment on the operation of 
his team until the investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Others had no such reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers flew the entire team to Hawaii to celebrate (this) year," McDonough 
said. "They spent $250,000 on one team party. The wives get Christmas gifts 
that are worth thousands. The 49ers go first class, and they don't mind telling 
you about it. That's why they are losing money. 
</P>
<P>
"But would they have won all those Super Bowls without Joe Montana? You can do 
all those things, all the parties, but if you do not have him, you are not 
going to win four Super Bowls. You are not winning because you are treating the 
players right. 
</P>
<P>
"They win because they did the best job of drafting in the '80s. (Director of 
scouting) Tony Razzano got the best 47 players. The 49ers didn't buy their 
team. They drafted it almost entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Modell bristles at the idea that DeBartolo keeps beating him out because of 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is more anxious or has a greater desire to win than any other club," 
Modell said. "Wanting to win is a desire found throughout the league, not just 
in San Francisco. I would give them all the credit in the world. But that does 
not lessen the desire of others." 
</P>
<P>
But who was it who cornered the Plan B free-agent market last spring? 
</P>
<P>
Instead of resting on his laurels, DeBartolo acted like a man fearful of never 
winning a title, like a man as desperate as, well, as Modell says he is. 
</P>
<P>
It was DeBartolo, not Modell, who filled his roster with aging veterans from 
other clubs as backup insurance at key positions. He got Cleveland cornerback 
Hanford Dixon (who has since retired) for two years at $1 million, Buffalo Bill 
nose tackle Fred Smerlas for a year at $750,000, New Orleans safety Dave Waymer 
for three years at $1.8 million, and Atlanta Falcon center Wayne Radloff for a 
year at $330,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers lost only one player, wide receiver Terry Greer, to Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the Rams, who have been to only one Super Bowl and lost that one 
a decade ago, signed only three Plan B players, none on defense, where they 
appeared to need the most help. They lost five of their 16 Plan B players this 
year and 12 of 17 last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the players association, the 49er payroll for last season was the 
highest in the league at $19.6 million. That does not include incentives or 
postseason and exhibition pay. The league average was $15.5 million. The 
Raiders were ninth in the league at $16.6 million. The Rams were at $12.6 
million, as were the Pittsburgh Steelers. Only two clubs, the New Orleans 
Saints at $12.2 million and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at $10 million, were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the Rams are trying to get to the Super Bowl," Coach John Robinson 
said. "We have been among the top teams for seven or eight years. Our record 
speaks to our trying to do everything to win while running a successful 
business as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question (the 49ers) have done a great job in terms of 
organization. But there are not many businesses that can say, 'Hey, let's take 
a financial loss so we can be successful." 
</P>
<P>
It has been difficult for Robinson, trying to win in an organization in which 
the owner, Georgia Frontiere, must depend on her team to survive financially 
against an organization in which survival is not an issue because of the 
financial empire behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are frustrations in any business," Robinson said. "It's unrealistic to 
say there are no problems in any kind of business, but I feel we have done 
things that have allowed us to win. That's our overall philosophy, and the 
proof is that we have won. The decision to trade for (quarterback Jim) Everett 
and a number of other things that have been done have made us competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Yet every year, it seems, the Rams have been embroiled in season-disrupting 
contract disputes, from Eric Dickerson several years ago to Henry Ellard and to 
Kevin Greene this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams, no matter what, are going to make money," McDonough said. "The 
Rams are certainly one of them." 
</P>
<P>
But John Shaw, the executive vice president who keeps the Rams on the plus side 
of the ledger year after year, insists that the Rams aren't losing the football 
wars to the 49ers because he is losing the battle of the checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you operate on the premise that the one who pays the most money gets the 
best team, I guess it would be difficult to compete," he said. "But I don't 
think it has any correlation. Look at some of the highest-paying teams, and 
they are not even in the playoffs; teams like the (New York) Jets and the 
(Washington) Redskins who, last year, were in the top four or five in payroll 
and were not even in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a system of total free agency, then the dollars would become the 
absolute difference. The team with the most dollars would theoretically get the 
best players. But with restricted free agency, it's difficult to ascertain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the 49ers') success is due to good coaching, good players and good 
organization. I don't think anything else would be relevant unless there was 
total free agency." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, for obvious reasons, would love to see that. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was free movement, the premium would be on smart management," he 
said. "The system the way it is now disguises mediocrity. A team like Tampa Bay 
loses and can blame it on the system. If we achieve free agency and the teams 
don't win, the fans will place the blame where it belongs, on the people 
selecting the players." 
</P>
<P>
If money is not the motivating force in getting to a Super Bowl, it is not a 
force on the playing field on Super Sunday, said McDonough, than it is in the 
owner's box. 
</P>
<P>
"You think the money in the Super Bowl ($75,000 to each winning player) means 
anything to Joe Montana?" McDonough said. "Not a damn thing. He is playing for 
pride, reputation and a place in history. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe to the 40th to the 47th player, $75,000 means a lot. But that player 
doesn't have an affect on the game because he is sitting on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Ross thinks that should change. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players have suggested a sensible plan, to take a portion of the shared 
revenue of the owners and award it on a percentage basis to winning teams in 
the Super Bowl," he said. "Perhaps 10% would go to the Super Bowl winner, 5% to 
the runner-up and 2 1/2% to the conference champs. A huge pot would provide a 
huge incentive to teams to strive to be the best they can be." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the system remains the same -- the rich get richer on the field, 
everybody gets rich in the front office, but only the big spenders seem to get 
to the Super Bowl.

JIM MURRAY: MAYBE THIS SPORT NEEDS A SALIVA TEST

Headline: "Andre Agassi Fined $3,000 for Unsportsmanlike Conduct. Accused of 
Spitting at Chair Umpire at U.S. Open. 'I Spit and Obviously Some of It Hit 
Him,' Tennis Star Says With a Shrug." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We take you now in imagination to the court of the Hon. Harry K. Kangaroo, 
where the court is swearing in Ernest N. Fair, a chair umpire from a tennis 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Mr. Fair, it has come to the attention of this court that you were spat 
upon by one of our tennis players in the midst of a match the other day." 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "That's right, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Extraordinary! And what action did you take against this boor?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Action, sir? Well, sir, I tried to penalize him a point." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "A point? Surely, you mean a set? A game, at least?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir, a point is the most we can penalize a player in that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "You mean like you will only start him out in the next game love-15?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "That's right, sir. But, as a matter of fact, I was overruled by the 
tournament supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "He decided the offense was not even worth love-15?!" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "That's right, sir. Well, you have to understand he didn't get any spit 
on him now, did he?" 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Mr. Fair, if someone came up to you on the street and spat at you, what 
would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, sir, I would probably smack him in the nose, spit back at him or 
call the cops and charge him with battery." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "You wouldn't simply wipe the spit off and go on dealing with him as if 
nothing happened?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "I don't think so. If a complete stranger came up and spit on me, I think 
I would want to belt him in the kisser." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Well, then, why didn't you belt this young tennis player in the kisser 
or at least spit on him, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, sir, we can't do that! They need him. He's one of the best tennis 
players in the world. He's a draw. The tour needs him. The tournament wants 
him. Television wants him." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "The tour needs him? What do we mean by the 'tour'? Are we talking here 
of a series of tennis events which have been capitalized and set up and venues 
provided, and where a lot of people put a lot of time and money and effort into 
creating an industry where these young popinjays can come and make millions of 
dollars batting a ball across a net, costumed like Casbah street beggars?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Did this young spit-maker have anything to do with putting this tour, 
these tournaments, together over the decades, or is he just cashing in on it. 
Does he have any idea what goes into creating this environment for him to get 
rich on?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir, he's only 20 years old. All he ever did was go out and play 
tennis. I guess he went to school. When he had time. I mean, now, he's no 
rocket scientist, is he?" 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Doesn't he know he's lucky this game is around for him to get rich on? 
Why do you think he felt he could get away with spitting on you, then?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, sir, he claimed only that his mouth was dry and he had to spit and 
some of it hit me." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Was his mouth dry?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Not the part that hit me." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Were you afraid to whack him one? Maybe it would do him some good? Is 
he physically imposing?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir. He's a little bitty fellow." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "You don't think he would spit at a fellow in, say, the streets of 
Marseilles?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "I don't think so, sir, although I'm told he does carry bodyguards around 
with him off the court." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Well, why should he feel he can get away with spitting on you and, I'm 
told, curse you and use obscene language against you?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, sir, you have to understand tennis. I mean, we've gotten used to 
being screamed at, reviled, cursed, insulted, libeled, ridiculed. It started 
with Jimmy Connors and Ilie Nastase, and John McEnroe brought it to an art 
form." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "What did he do?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, he used to call us 'the pits.' He threw some rare old tantrums." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "And tennis came down hard on him?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir. Tennis just let it slide. A let call. They never even 
slapped him hard on the wrist until he got to be over the hill. They finally 
kicked him out of a tournament in Australia this year, defaulted him. But he 
wasn't going to be around very long anyway. He can't play anymore, I don't care 
how many Sanchezes he beats." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Was he ever defaulted in his prime?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir. We just had to sit there and take it." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "What if one of these fellows physically assaulted you?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "That's a good question. I should think that would depend on what seed he 
was. If he was seeded 189th, I expect they'd kick him out of the tournament. If 
he was seeded No. 1 or 2, I would expect them to find some way to kick us out 
of the tournament. I suppose if he killed us they would fine him a point." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "But they wouldn't even let you assess a lousy point on a guy who spit 
at you?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, they did fine him $3,000. The next day, after a review of the tape 
did show him spitting and cursing." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "$3,000! Is that going to hurt in any way?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "I should think not, sir. He's made millions. He pays more than that for 
his earrings." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Were you afraid for your income? Is that why you didn't retaliate?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir, I don't rely on tennis for my income. A lot of us in a lot 
of tournaments are volunteers. We've worked for nothing. We love the game. I 
didn't retaliate because I would have been kicked out of tennis for life." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Wait a minute! Wouldn't they only make you sit out a point? Or fine you 
an income equivalency -- say $30? Wouldn't it be worth it just to drop him?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir. I love tennis. I wouldn't want to do anything to jeopardize 
the game. I wouldn't want to risk hurting a great player." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Have bad calls or putative bad calls ever decided a game? 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "No, sir, not really. I don't think great players like Rod Laver ever 
even disputed a questionable call. They even up." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "And this young player who spit, did he lose?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir. He won easily in four sets, one of them by love." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "So why does he behave in this detestable manner?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Well, tennis players are different from you and me." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Thank God for that. But I think the only guy I would let spit at me and 
get away with is Mike Tyson, not some little twerp with a two-handed backhand. 
This court finds that this country has lost the capacity for indignation. Or do 
you think the public will boo him?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Oh, no, sir, they'll cheer him to the echo, make a hero of him. They see 
him as spitting in the face of the Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
Court: "Is he?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair: "Sir, he is the Establishment. We're just the butlers and the downstairs 
maids."

TENNIS: TOP-SEEDED STEFFI GRAF GIVES THE 14-YEAR-OLD A 6-1, 6-2 LESSON IN THE

Security guards flanked 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati as she moved through a 
crowd in a tunnel on her way back to the locker room Monday. She had a lollipop 
in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, Capriati sat glumly in the interview room and tersely answered 
questions about how she lost her fourth-round U.S. Open match to Steffi Graf, 
6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the end of the world for me," Capriati said. "I'll just think 
about it and continue on." 
</P>
<P>
It took only 53 minutes for Graf to teach Capriati a lesson and send her back 
to school, where her peers do not smash forehands at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-grade classes began last Monday at the private school in Boca Raton, 
Fla., where Capriati is enrolled, but she knew she had just learned something 
very important about Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steffi is definitely still at another level," Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker also won, reaching the quarterfinals, although not exactly with 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
Becker engaged in a 3-hour 14-minute endurance test with Darren Cahill, who 
dumped Becker in the second round two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Becker beat Cahill, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, and said it actually is better to 
play five sets. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"It's tougher for your head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing tough about Andre Agassi's 7-5, 6-0, 6-2 victory over Jay 
Berger. The only difficult choice was to whom in the crowd he would throw his 
sweaty shirt after the match. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who would meet Becker in the semifinals, must first play a quarterfinal 
match with Andrei Cherkasov, who followed up his upset victory over Michael 
Chang with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 decision over Christo van Rensburg. 
</P>
<P>
Becker must beat No. 9 Aaron Krickstein -- who beat Amos Mansdorf, 6-3, 6-4, 
6-4 -- before getting at Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Graf was swift to dispel any notion that her two-year reign at the U.S. Open 
might be in danger because of Capriati's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"You could feel how much tension there was," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Graf seemed positively serene before the match as she idly grabbed a steel 
beam above her head in the tunnel waiting to go out on the court. Nearby, 
Capriati nervously shifted her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Graf had the first set secured in 21 minutes, helped by two service breaks. 
</P>
<P>
On set point, Capriati returned a serve long. Graf took one step back, watched 
the ball bounce past the baseline, then walked briskly to her chair. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati committed 18 of her 30 unforced errors in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"All she had to do was get the ball on the court," Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
It soon got worse. Capriati lost her serve at 15 to drop the first game, failed 
to win a point for 0-2 then lost her serve for 0-3 when Graf cracked a forehand 
passing shot at 30-40. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati made one challenge. She broke Graf with a sharply hit forehand into 
the corner, held at love for 2-3 and then held two break points. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought then that maybe I could hang in there," Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't. Graf saved one break point with a service winner, and Capriati 
blew the other when her missile of a forehand passing shot buried itself in the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it was routine. Capriati fell to 15-40 serving at 2-4, then was 
caught sprinting along the baseline chasing down shots Graf deposited in one 
corner and then the other. Capriati couldn't reach the second, and Graf served 
out the match at 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
At deuce, Capriati netted a forehand, then Graf powered one more forehand into 
the corner to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Graf and Capriati met at the net and shook hands, but while Graf signed 
autographs for fans in the box seats, Capriati collected her rackets and left 
the court quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't doing anything out there," Capriati said. "Next time, I can't let 
that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Since she turned pro in March, Capriati is 1-7 against players ranked in the 
top five: 0-3 against Gabriela Sabatini, 0-2 against Graf, 0-1 against Martina 
Navratilova, 0-1 against Monica Seles and 1-0 against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ease of her victory, Graf said she was not trying to prove a point 
at the expense of Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely not," Graf said. "It's very difficult to rate the match because I 
expected a very tough match. I knew that it wasn't going to be easy against her 
because of the expectation. It just turned out differently. It happens quite a 
few times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf began a record 160th consecutive week ranked No. 1, breaking Jimmy 
Connors' mark of 159. Martina Navratilova and Ivan Lendl held No. 1 for 156 
consecutive weeks. . . . Zina Garrison, who is on track to meet Graf in the 
semifinals, continued to move silently through the draw. Garrison defeated 
Nathalie Tauziat, 6-1, 7-5, in the fourth round. So far, Garrison has not lost 
a set. Her explanation: "I really think there's a lot of skill and a lot of 
luck." Garrison, fourth-seeded, said she is happy when she is not given the 
same attention in a tournament as such players as Graf or Jennifer Capriati: 
"Before you know it, you sneak up on them. I really don't worry about it. It's 
much easier to concentrate that way. You just go on and play tennis." . . . 
Jana Novotna defeated seventh-seeded Katerina Maleeva, 6-4, 6-2, and will play 
Graf in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker said he watched John McEnroe's 4-hour 20-minute victory over 
Emilio Sanchez on television Sunday. "It was difficult to miss such a long 
match," he said. "Every time I turned on the television, he was still on." 
McEnroe's five-set victory was an impressive display, Becker said. "I was 
amazed that he came back from two sets to one down," Becker said. "He kept his 
mind and his temper and fought back. I thought it was very good." Andre Agassi 
was also high on McEnroe: "I'd live to see him in the finals." If McEnroe beats 
David Wheaton in the quarterfinals, he would face either Ivan Lendl or Pete 
Sampras in the semifinals.

BONDS' STOCK FINALLY HAS RISEN AT UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS: RATHER THAN TRANSFER, HE WAITED FOR HIS CHANCE TO START AT QUARTERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decade of the 1990s symbolize a fresh start for UCLA and quarterback Jim 
Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the '80s were forgettable for the Bruins, just 1989, when the team 
with seven consecutive bowl victories spiraled downward to a 3-7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, who was named UCLA's starting quarterback two weeks ago, a decision that 
sent last year's starter, Bret Johnson, packing to Michigan State, is an 
example that good things happen to people who are patient. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds might have been UCLA's No. 1 quarterback last year if he hadn't performed 
poorly in a scrimmage before the season-opening game against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
So he had to be content as a backup, only getting into games when Johnson 
floundered. 
</P>
<P>
However, he never seriously considered leaving UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The thought popped into his mind, he said, but he quickly dismissed it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a junior, he is looking forward to a new season with a restructured 
offense designed by Homer Smith, an offensive coordinator beginning his third 
tour of duty with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the past winter, the attitude of the whole team is really up," Bonds 
said. "We had a feeling of 'Let's get on with the 1990 season, so we can forget 
about 1989.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people feel they've got something to prove and that 1989 was 
a fluke. Everyone is really enthusiastic and pumped up to get the season 
going." 
</P>
<P>
No one is more pumped up than Bonds for Saturday's game against Oklahoma at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And now he says he has a grasp of Smith's multifaceted offense. 
</P>
<P>
"As complex as Coach Smith's offense seems to be, I picked it up relatively 
fast last spring and during the summer, and now everything is starting to fit 
together," Bonds said. 
</P>
<P>
Several UCLA players have said that the offense was too predictable last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have been limited to what we could do last year, but as the season 
got going there were only a couple of plays that we ran very well, and we 
tended to keep running those plays over and over," Bonds said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have anything to branch off to, so at the end of the season our 
offense was pretty predictable." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than meet inside before practice, the offensive unit has its classroom 
on the field an hour before the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith believes that walking through plays on the field is much better 
than drawing them on a chalk board," Bonds said. "It has helped me a lot, 
seeing things on the field instead of X's and O's on a board." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attention to detail has been reported, such as center Lance Zeno 
snapping the ball to Bonds at a precise 85-degree angle. There's more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (quarterbacks') hands have to be together so there is no air showing 
between them," Bonds said. "Then when the ball comes up at 85 degrees and 
splits your hands apart, Coach Smith says there's no greater feeling in the 
world than taking a perfect snap." 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback also goes through what is called sequences in practice, 
imagining that the first receiver is covered and then the second and finally 
throwing to the third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that has helped my foot speed," Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In selecting Bonds to replace Johnson as the starting quarterback, Smith talked 
of Bonds' "ball speed." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bonds says that his arm isn't any stronger than it was when he was a 
standout quarterback at Hart High in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe my getting the ball off faster has improved through sequencing, but my 
arm was pretty much as strong as it would get coming out of high school," Bonds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, six feet and 210 pounds, appeared in seven of UCLA's 11 games last 
season and completed 60% of his passes for 300 yards and one touchdown. He had 
four passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
He says UCLA is three deep at all positions in the backfield and singled out 
his replacements, redshirt freshmen Tommy Maddox and Bert Emanuel, for special 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert is really getting good at running the option," Bonds said. "He broke 
three or four 70-yard runs in spring practice. Tommy has picked up the offense 
really well. He has never been exposed to our type of system. He has a live arm 
and, at 6-4, he has the ability to see over the offensive line. He's going to 
be a good one before he leaves." 
</P>
<P>
As for the departed Johnson, Bonds said: 
</P>
<P>
"I wish him all the success in the world and I hope he gets a chance to play 
next year. I was a little surprised when I heard he was going to Michigan 
State. It's not the California beach weather he's used to."

REED AGREES; HERRMANN, 12 OTHERS, CUT; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: ROSTER LIMIT OF 47 IS REACHED. THE CLUB WILL CONTINUE ITS SEARCH FOR A 
CORNERBACK, ROBINSON SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Holdout defensive end Doug Reed is back in uniform, and free agent Derrick 
Faison survived the cut. But 13 players -- including quarterback Mark Herrmann 
and veteran linebacker Mel Owens, who will be placed on injured reserve today 
and probably will be sidelined for the season -- were waived as the Rams 
trimmed their roster to the 47-man limit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Today figures to bring another flurry of roster moves as the Rams search for a 
cornerback and try to decide which of their walking wounded will go on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, a six-year veteran, ended his 41-day holdout when he agreed to a one-year 
contract Monday. He said he is happy with the deal and happier still to be away 
from his favorite taco stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was off and on with the conditioning stuff," Reed said. "When I got 
frustrated, I'd go down to the local taco shop and eat about 15 tacos. When I'm 
mad, I eat tacos. And I was mad about 30 of the 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
"But really, I think I'm in decent shape. I'm in as good shape as some of these 
guys who've been here but haven't been able to practice, so we're all in the 
same boat." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who requested to be traded at one point during his holdout, said he 
thinks he could put any bitterness he feels toward the organization behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we should have started earlier and not waited until the last minute, 
but they needed me pretty bad and I'm here to close up the holes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams said they planned to keep three quarterbacks, including Herrmann, Jim 
Everett's primary backup the last two seasons. But the rash of recent injuries 
apparently led to the decision to waive Herrmann. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said he will "still consider" retaining Herrmann in 
addition to Everett and Chuck Long in the probable event Herrmann passes 
through waivers, in which case the Rams could re-sign him as early as today. 
But Herrmann, who had an impressive exhibition season, was clearly 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating," he said. "I thought I had a real good camp and 
progressed well. It's disappointing, but it's just the way of this business." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie wide receivers Faison and Tony Lomack, friends who thought they were 
battling for the No. 4 receiver spot, both came out winners Monday when the 
Rams decided to keep five receivers. Hamstring injuries to Henry Ellard, 
Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox played a prominent role in that decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe my feelings," Faison said. "I didn't sleep at all last night. 
Now, I just have to work harder and harder to try and stay on the team." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have only two healthy cornerbacks -- veteran Bobby Humphery and rookie 
Latin Berry -- and the potential for disaster is obvious. Robinson was asked if 
he is considering moving safety Anthony Newman, who didn't practice Monday 
because of a sprained toe, to cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
"We're considering moving Newman out there and we're considering looking for 
somebody on the (waiver) wire or even a trade," Robinson said. "We have to 
consider everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mel Owens and Mark Herrmann, the Rams waived linebacker Stephen 
Bates, defensive tackle General Brown, wide receiver Paco Craig, center Elbert 
Crawford, fullback Mel Farr, wide receiver Monty Gilbreath, offensive tackle 
John Guerrero, defensive tackle Jerry Leggett, safety Lupe Sanchez, wide 
receiver Tim Stallworth and running back Fred Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Jerry Gray, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Saturday, was 
walking briskly around Rams Park Monday. "There's no pain at all," Gray said. 
"I just can't run on it." . . . Unless the Rams pick up a cornerback who can 
return punts, Henry Ellard will be the Rams' punt-returner Sunday against Green 
Bay, a job he won by default because of injuries to Tony Lomack (hamstring) and 
Darryl Henley (hip).

BEUERLEIN RETURNS, BUT EVANS IS WAIVED; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: ROSTER CUTDOWN DAY CLAIMS FORMER USC QUARTERBACK. HUNLEY, DAVIS JOIN 
LIST OF UNEMPLOYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein returned and quarterback Vince Evans left Monday 
along with 11 other players as the Raiders reduced their roster to 47. 
</P>
<P>
Ending an acrimonious seven-week holdout, Beuerlein signed with the Raiders 
Sunday and practiced Monday. No contract terms were disclosed but Beuerlein is 
believed to have signed a one-year deal. Beuerlein, who earned $140,000 last 
season, previously rejected a three-year deal worth an average of $500,000 per 
season after the Raiders signed quarterback Jay Schroeder to a one-year, 
$1-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, who put his fingers to his lips when approached by reporters, was 
guarded in talking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be here and happy to be with my teammates," Beuerlein said. "And 
that's about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come in here last week, but they said to wait until Sunday," 
Beuerlein said. "So I came in and I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Although he received a two-week roster exemption, Beuerlein wants to play this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my decision," he said. "I feel like I'm in shape, but I have to get 
out and practice and see what's going on. I don't know what their thinking is 
or what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jeff Francis also was waived. Evans, a former USC quarterback, said 
he expects to return Wednesday if he isn't claimed by another team. 
</P>
<P>
If Evans doesn't clear waivers, the Raiders will enter Sunday's regular-season 
opener against Denver at the Coliseum with Schroeder as the only quarterback 
who played during the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve knows the system," Coach Art Shell said. "You have to worry about not 
having people in camp. That's the one unfortunate thing about it. But Marcus 
Allen didn't have camp last year either, but he came in and played after five 
days of work. So, who's to say what you need in order to play?" 
</P>
<P>
Guard John Gesek, who started every game last season, was traded to the Dallas 
Cowboys for an undisclosed draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year veteran, Gesek became expendable when the Raiders signed free 
agent Max Montoya from the Cincinnati Bengals last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Raiders are thin at quarterback, they're even thinner at middle 
linebacker after waiving Ricky Hunley and Ron Burton. Riki Ellison, sidelined 
by a pulled muscle last week, is the only middle linebacker on the roster. He 
has missed two of the last three seasons because of arm injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some young kids, and we've got to take a look at the young kids and 
move people in there," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
If Hunley clears waivers he could return, or the Raiders could acquire another 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Unseated by Ellison in the starting lineup during the exhibition season, Hunley 
declined comment as he left the Raider training complex, brushing past 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A six-year veteran, Hunley was acquired by the Raiders from Phoenix as a free 
agent last season. He played in 16 games, starting one. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders also released defensive backs Derrick Crudup and Elvis Patterson, 
running back Kerry Porter, guard Bruce Davis, linebacker Darin Jordan, tight 
end Trey Junkin and wide receiver Stefon Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Crudup was converted from running back to safety during training camp. 
Patterson was acquired as a Plan B free agent from the San Diego Chargers last 
March. Francis spent last season on the Raiders' developmental squad. Porter 
played on special teams last season. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-year veteran, Davis was reacquired by the Raiders from Houston last month. 
Jordan was signed as free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers last February. 
</P>
<P>
Junkin caught three passes for 32 yards last season and was the long snapper on 
punts. Adams was moved to wide receiver from defensive back this season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, rookie defensive end Anthony Smith, who underwent knee surgery 
Friday, was placed on the injured reserve list, meaning that the Raiders' No. 1 
draft pick is out for the season. . . . After sustaining a hairline fracture in 
Saturday's game against San Diego, running back Napoleon McCallum's left wrist 
was placed in a cast. "The trainer seems to think he can (play)" Sunday, Coach 
Art Shell said. . . . Fullback Steve Smith, who sustained a bruised right hand, 
also is expected to play against Denver. . . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder 
declined to respond to comments made by former teammate Doug Williams, who 
attacked Schroeder in his new book. Williams said Schroeder had a bad attitude 
and a large ego when they were teammates on the Washington Redskins in 1986 and 
1987. "You can write a book about whatever you want to write about," Schroeder 
said. "I've got no comments on that. That's not my territory. He's got to sell 
some books."

NFC IS THE 49ERS AND EVERYONE CHASING THEM; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: THE WEST IS BEST, BUT CENTRAL HAS FOUR TEAMS THAT COULD WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP IF SAN FRANCISCO FALTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The thing that makes 1990 different in the National Football League is that for 
the first time in years, the dominant team of the era is positioned to win a 
third consecutive Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. With another season like last year's, the San Francisco 
49ers could win their fifth Super Bowl in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
With the regular season starting this weekend, San Francisco's quarterback, Joe 
Montana, shares a remarkable NFL record with Terry Bradshaw, who led the 1970s 
Pittsburgh Steelers to four championships. 
</P>
<P>
As Montana reached the heights in the playoffs, the 49ers routed three of the 
best teams in football last winter in winning their fourth championship of the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
They eliminated the Minnesota Vikings, 41-13; then the Rams, 30-3; and, in a 
Super Bowl anticlimax, the Denver Broncos, 55-10. And in so doing, they made 
believers of nearly everyone who plays or coaches football. 
</P>
<P>
And Montana is still on the team. 
</P>
<P>
So is Jerry Rice. So is Roger Craig. So is Ronnie Lott, the defensive star of 
all four of San Francisco's Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
So is George Seifert, who succeeded Bill Walsh as the 49ers' coach last season. 
And so is Eddie DeBartolo, the inventor of checkbook football, the club owner 
whose costly commitment to winning keeps paying off. 
</P>
<P>
Counting regular-season and postseason games, the 49ers since late 1988 are 
24-3 (.889). That's one of the hottest streaks in NFL history -- considering 
the quality of the teams they're beating in a league widely known for parity. 
It's reminiscent of 1984, when the Detroit Tigers started 20-4 in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
And it's keeping the 49ers on course to join the 1929-31 Green Bay Packers and 
the 1965-67 Packers as teams winning three consecutive NFL championships. 
</P>
<P>
Can anyone stop these people? 
</P>
<P>
In the league's dominant conference, five or six of their 1990 rivals have some 
kind of chance. Three of them are Eastern teams: the Washington Redskins, 
Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The others are the Rams and possibly two from the NFC Central: the Vikings and 
Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 49ers, all are severely flawed, although the Redskins may come 
closer to the 49er ideal -- all-around balance and depth, with an accent on 
productive passing -- than any other club. 
</P>
<P>
It could well have been a Redskin year if the NFL hadn't just made a major 
procedural change. 
</P>
<P>
The league has decided to admit six wild-card teams to the playoffs this winter 
-- three from each conference -- along with the six division winners. 
</P>
<P>
And that gives the 49ers a bonus chance at the championship -- a chance that no 
other title defender in 70 years ever had. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe that six NFC teams could be better than the 49ers. Even if 
they lose the division title to the Rams, they will almost surely advance as a 
wild card. 
</P>
<P>
And if they finish fast in December -- if they have the momentum going into the 
January schedule, regardless of any earlier injuries or other kinds of early 
trouble -- the 49ers will be the team to beat in the playoffs. Again. 
</P>
<P>
In one-through-10 order, here are their principal challengers, the principal 
NFC teams that are most likely to succeed if the 49ers misfire: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1) WASHINGTON REDSKINS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Mark Rypien 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Joe Gibbs (102-48-0) 
</P>
<P>
In turf language, the Redskins, under Gibbs, are usually either there or 
thereabouts, finishing close when they don't finish first. And such a team is 
always a threat, even when it isn't among the favorites. This isn't a very 
flashy team, even in its three-receiver formations when Rypien is dealing to 
Art Monk, Ricky Sanders and Gary Clark, but it is a tough, solid competitor. 
And Gibbs employs highly respected assistants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2) RAMS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jim Everett 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Robinson (71-50-0) 
</P>
<P>
This team's early-season schedule, with a September off-week, isn't as alarming 
as its injuries, and down the road, other teams will be hurt, too. If Robinson 
can hold on until defensive back Jerry Gray returns, the Rams will still 
contend. Much depends on the quality of Ram depth. For a while last year, depth 
carried the 49ers and Redskins -- and the Rams appear to have it at least at 
wide receiver. Their strength is Everett and one of the NFL's great pass 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3) DETROIT LIONS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Rodney Peete 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Wayne Fontes (9-12) 
</P>
<P>
Few if any Detroit starters would make the first team at Minnesota. The Lions 
aren't an NFL power. But late last season, they learned how to win with their 
new run-and-shoot offense, and there could be a carry-over this season because 
their opponents haven't learned how to stop it. And eventually, they expect 
Andre Ware to be their quarterback. The Lions have come up with a secret weapon 
under Fontes, a defense that ranks behind only Minnesota's in their division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4) MINNESOTA VIKINGS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Wade Wilson 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jerry Burns (41-28-0) 
</P>
<P>
This team should have won at least one of the recent Super Bowls. And again 
this year, it should run over Detroit and all other division rivals. It has the 
players and -- on defense -- the coaching. But it hasn't been able to win 
enough with its old-time offense, whose passer, Wade Wilson, is the NFL's most 
underrated and even now is still fighting for his job. The coaches often misuse 
receiver Anthony Carter, too. Some 1990 coaching changes provide some hope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5) PHILADELPHIA EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
QB: Randall Cunningham 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Buddy Ryan (33-31-1) 
</P>
<P>
Football people call the NFL's many journeymen about equal in all cities and 
say a winner is simply a team with a few distinguished players. The example is 
Philadelphia, where few are distinguished except Cunningham and three defensive 
linemen: Reggie White, Jerome Brown and Clyde Simmons. The only other blue 
chips: Mike Quick, 31, a great receiver often hurt, and young tight end Keith 
Jackson, whose holdout will hurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6) NEW YORK GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Phil Simms 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Parcells (69-49-1) 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much chance that the Giants will finish this far back, and in the 
East it will come as no surprise if they win it all. One question is whether 
their summer-long holdout pass rusher, Lawrence Taylor, worked hard enough on 
his own to get into NFL shape. The Giants field the best defense in their 
division, along with a plucky quarterback and a potentially big-time running 
back, rookie Rodney Hampton. Little David Meggett will win a game or two on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7) NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: John Fourcade 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Mora (38-26). 
</P>
<P>
The race for division titles and wild-card status in the NFC doesn't run this 
deep unless one of the above six clubs throws a shoe. No NFL team is better 
coached than the Saints, but no team has as much to beat in its own division. 
The Saints won't rise unless, or until, rookie quarterback Mike Buck matures. 
Fourcade and predecessor Bobby Hebert are journeymen. Linebackers Pat Swilling, 
Rickey Jackson and Sam Mills are the team's only class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8) ATLANTA FALCONS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jerry Glanville (1st year) 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's most improved team is led by a competent quarterback, one of the 
league's ablest. Other quality is calling Atlanta home now, too: Bill Fralic 
and Chris Hinton in the offensive line, Andre Rison at wide receiver, Tony 
Casillas and Deion Sanders on defense and possibly rookie runner Steve 
Broussard, among others. But as individuals, the Falcons are harder to handle 
than most. Only if Glanville can motivate this bunch will Atlanta have 
something at last. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9) GREEN BAY PACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Anthony Dilweg 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Lindy Infante (14-18) 
</P>
<P>
As a 1989 rookie, Dilweg nearly beat out the Packers' famous 1990 holdout, Don 
Majkowski, who led them to a record four one-point decisions in a miracle 
season. The pass-oriented Infante offense is a little different from the others 
in the NFL -- the 49er-Ram types and the run-and-shoot types -- and a bit 
harder to execute. But the test is degree of improvement, and the Packers 
improve all the time. Their stars are receiver Sterling Sharpe and linebacker 
Tim Harris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10) CHICAGO BEARS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Jim Harbaugh, Mike Tomczak 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Ditka (84-45) 
</P>
<P>
The Bears made their biggest mistake years ago when they went to Big Ten 
running teams Michigan and Ohio State for their passers. There are no 
indications that either Harbaugh or Tomczak will ever win. With Purdue's Jim 
Everett, the Bears would have it made offensively. And if defensive tackle Dan 
Hampton is as crippled as he seems, the defense is shot. The coach is smart and 
sound but can no longer play. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
) THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
This has become the NFL's best division, with uniformly good coaching and 
strong teams. Because their 1980s coach, Bill Walsh, was the most accomplished 
recruiter of his time, the 49ers recently have won the division title most 
years. They're still winning with Walsh's recruits and, to be sure, his system. 
The challenge for the new Seifert, or somebody in San Francisco, is to keep the 
talent rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
The late-'80s challenge for San Francisco's principal competitor, Robinson, was 
to convert the Rams from a running team to a passing team, which he did. By 
last year, most critics ranked the 49ers and Rams 1-2 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints and Falcons, challenged by the California teams, have brought in 
Mora and Glanville to strengthen the Southern precinct. With slightly better 
material, Mora would be a regular in the playoffs. Glanville, formerly 
Houston's coach, has been in the playoffs the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the West, this is a peaks-and-valleys division, with Washington, 
Philadelphia and the New York Giants on the peaks and the other two far, far 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Cardinals are probably farther from the Super Bowl than any other 
NFL team. Under a new coach, Joe Bugel, the Cardinals will attack this year in 
the one-back offense that Bugel brought from Washington -- and that Dan Henning 
has carried from Washington to San Diego -- and they would settle for the 
Marion Butts-type that Henning turned up last year when he drafted the 
original. It could be the Cardinals' top pick: Anthony Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
But if Timm Rosenbach isn't an NFL quarterback, the hard-luck Phoenix area will 
be as completely out of it as the day that Neil Lomax had to quit. The one 
great Phoenix player is safety Tim McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
At Dallas, the jury is still out on Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman as well as 
his coach, Jimmy Johnson, and the owner, Jerry Jones. But Johnson, on his 
record, has an NFL future. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
If the NFC West is the league's strongest, the NFC Central is the strangest NFL 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, with Mike Lynn as general manager, have rounded up more talent 
than any NFL team east of San Francisco. The Lions, with Mouse Davis and June 
Jones advising, are the NFL's first in the run-and-shoot formation. The Bears 
have the league's best-known coach in Ditka, along with most of the recent 
tradition in this old black-and-blue division but perhaps not enough else. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers also have a distinguished past. But in pitiless-weather country, 
the new Packer coach, Infante, has elected to play pass-ball along with the 
Lions -- who live in a domed stadium -- and thus no one can read Green Bay's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The other bay team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has been picked by many 
Southerners to land in the playoffs this season. If, in his fourth NFL season, 
Vinny Testaverde becomes an NFL quarterback, the Buccaneers have a chance. 
Their hope is that former Charger Gary Anderson, a gifted but small runner, 
will play 16 games. As coach and general manager, Ray Perkins calls every shot 
in Tampa, where his three-year record is 14-33.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: IN A MATURING WINE INDUSTRY, DISTRIBUTION IS EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NAPA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, this valley's future looked as unlimited as its vine-studded 
horizon. New wineries were sprouting almost as fast as vineyards were 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
The yuppie generation had selected California Chardonnay as its beverage de 
rigueur. And the wine business talked of Americans adopting the habits of the 
French, even sipping vin ordinaire with their french fries. 
</P>
<P>
But as the 1990 grape harvest begins here, so does an era of reduced 
expectations. U.S. wine consumption has dropped slightly in each of the past 
two years. Sales of jug wines and coolers are down. The only significant growth 
has been in premium wines, but that's mostly due to people trading up to more 
expensive labels -- -- not buying more wine. Liquor distributors have been 
consolidating, making it much more difficult and expensive for smaller wineries 
to get their product to market. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, an ocean of Chardonnay is about to flood the market, the result of 
vines planted several years ago before people quit drinking as much wine. 
Consumers should soon see lower prices on some high-quality wines. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's pessimists read all this and predict consolidations, 
bankruptcies and forced sales of wineries that are unable to compete under the 
tougher circumstances. There is ominous evidence that this is already 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
But the optimists say as long as California continues to improve the quality of 
its wine -- and over the past 20 years it has come to rival the French -- sales 
and profits will take care of themselves; there may be ups and downs, but the 
world will always buy quality, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the reality of cutthroat competition in a maturing industry has 
supplanted the fantasy of genteel life in a Napa Valley vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric used these days by wine industry experts hits you like a splash of 
sparkling water. "Contrary to the hopes of many vintners and despite 
substantial investments by major consumer goods companies in the 1970s and 
early 1980s, wine has not become an everyday part of American life," industry 
analyst Jean-Michel Valette of Hambrecht &amp; Quist wrote in a report last 
month. "It is still consumed primarily on special occasions or when dining out 
-- times when the package is being consumed just as much as the contents. Jug 
wines simply do not fulfill a growing number of consumers' image-based needs." 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, California had little pretense of competing with the world's 
best wine producers. It made mostly good-quality bulk wines, the kind sold in 
jugs at relatively low prices. But, with the help of research done by 
agriculture experts at UC Davis, the quality of California grapes and wines 
improved dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Money from banks and investors started to pour into the industry. Premium 
wineries in the Napa Valley became a prestige investment, and the price of Napa 
vineyards soared; the number of wineries in the state skyrocketed past 800. 
And, because of liberal tax laws that permitted big investment writeoffs, it 
was possible for a gentleman farmer to operate a small winery and live the good 
life. How much wine he produced wasn't too important, nor was his market share 
or his distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
In time, California wines appeared on and even dominated wine lists at fine 
restaurants. The money to be made in premium California wines became apparent, 
and even major U.S. corporations, including Coca-Cola, bought in. Most are gone 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early 1980s, people fell in love with the wine business, and they knew 
they could write (their costs) off," said Jon A. Fredrikson, a San Francisco 
wine industry consultant. But the investment writeoffs mostly ended with tax 
reform in the mid-1980s, about the time the number of distributors began to 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
Distributors are the wholesalers who go to stores and restaurants and sell 
wine. A decline in their number makes it tougher for wineries with fewer brands 
and smaller production to find distributors willing to market their goods. 
</P>
<P>
"You need multiple brands and at least 200,000 cases a year to make it today," 
said Donald D. Bade, president of Santa Rosa-based Vintech Wine Group, which is 
forming a "collection" of investor-owned premium wineries with a common 
marketing and distribution network. By comparison, many of the small wineries 
that started a decade ago used to be content turning out 25,000 cases a year, 
or perhaps even less. 
</P>
<P>
Bade predicts that some small wineries will close over the next several years 
after searching fruitlessly for distributors or investment partners. "Three 
years ago we had a hard time finding any wineries for sale," he said. "Now 
hardly a week goes by that we don't hear from somebody interested in selling 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Fredrikson, too, has been hearing lately from wineries that need capital to 
expand production to meet the new economics of the Napa Valley. "It's a 
maturing business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jug wine producers consolidated long ago, leaving giant E. &amp; J. Gallo far 
above all the others. And the low-end premium winemakers -- those that sell 
products for $3 to $7 per bottle -- also did so several years ago, leaving 
Gallo, Sebastiani, Sutter Home, Glen Ellen and Wine World Estates the clear 
leaders. Now the consolidation will spread even to producers of more expensive 
wines, according to Valette and others. 
</P>
<P>
This sobering maturity for the young California premium wine business has been 
forced on it by cold reality: Americans aren't French or Italian, and they 
don't drink as much wine. It no longer appears as if they will substantially 
increase their consumption -- no matter how sophisticated they become about 
appellations, varieties and aging. That's hard for some wine enthusiasts to 
accept, but it's what has driven some investors from the business already. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, U.S. industries have "matured" for generations. Makers of better 
mousetraps have been acquired by those that offer them access to capital and 
help with distribution. The end result is fewer mousetrap makers. It's as 
American as apple pie, or in this case Napa Valley Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate irony may be that, while the big American firms that dabbled in 
California wine a decade ago got fainthearted when increased consumption failed 
to materialize, some of the biggest acquirers and consolidators of the state's 
premium wineries recently have been European food and liquor conglomerates. 
Switzerland's Nestle, for instance, bought Wine World Estates. Great Britain's 
Grand Metropolitan owns Heublein Fine Wines, and Allied-Lyons, also of Great 
Britain, owns Wine Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The wine business in Europe "matured" long ago. There is virtually no more land 
available for expansion; vineyards here seem like a bargain, and even the 
Europeans admit that California wines are now comparable to their own. 
</P>
<P>
European winemakers learned long ago what the Napa Valley is just now learning: 
Quality being about equal, he who has distribution has everything.

Tokyo stocks closed lower Monday after news of rising oil prices and talk of 
investigations into speculative activity hit the market in afternoon trade. 
</P>
<P>
Thin volume, scattered index-linked selling and concern that high oil prices 
could mean even tighter credit fueled the decline. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index lost 557.94 points, or 2.15%, to close at 
25,420.43 after rising 308.41 on Friday. Volume was 360 million shares, against 
600 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has promised trading partners it will spend more on public works," said 
Paul Migliorato, broker at Jardine Fleming Securities. "If it can't cut that 
spending to control oil-driven inflation, it will put upward pressure on 
interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
There were fears that costlier oil could mean even tighter credit, brokers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude futures jumped by more than $1 a 
barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange, almost matching early 
gains in Singapore, where Dubai crude futures hit daily trading limits. Brent 
for October delivery stood at $27.85 per barrel, a rise of $1.10 from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After losing 16.3% in August, the benchmark Nikkei index began its first 
trading day in September by firming steadily after the open, gaining more than 
100 points above Friday's close of 25,978.37 in the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But news that Saudi Arabia had raised its prices for liquefied petroleum gas as 
of Sept. 1 sparked a selloff in afternoon trading, driving the Nikkei down to 
close on its lows. Oil issues were one of the few sectors to gain on the day. 
</P>
<P>
The broader first section index, Topix, slumped 28.05 points to 1,945.92 after 
gaining 17.95 on Friday. The Topix has lost 12.4% of its value since the start 
of August. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the (Labor Day) holiday in New York, many people don't know what 
sort of attitude to take to the market," said Daniel Marull, a trader at Sanyo 
Securities. "We had good volume for the past four days, but it will be very 
weak today." 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, stocks edged slightly higher in very slow trade with investors 
sidelined for fear of sudden changes in the Middle East standoff and in the 
absence of other market-moving factors, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's little to talk about at the moment," a broker at a British brokerage 
said. "There are no other factors really apart from the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong index closed at 2,014.77, down 13.60 points, while the Hang Seng 
index finished at 3,066.81, off 20.69 points. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan stocks closed lower across the board as nervous investors, still worried 
about the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf, took profits on gains seen 
over the last two sessions, dealers said. The weighted index fell 193.22 
points, or 5.1%, to finish at 3,574.89 against Saturday's 3,768.11 close. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed a touch firmer after a session devoid of major 
news or direction. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index ended 3.8 
points higher at 2,166.6. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, shares ended mixed at the close of a lifeless 
trading session. The DAX index of 30 leading shares eased 0.29 points to end at 
1,629.22. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed sharply lower in thin trading. The CAC-40 index 
ended at 1,644.01, down 46.16 points, or 2.73%. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against most major foreign currencies Monday and gold prices 
were higher in thin trading. 
</P>

Without any fundamental news to guide the market, dealers said most of the week

Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and International Business Machines Corp., once bitter 
adversaries in a copyright battle, have joined forces to develop financial 
management and marketing computer software, Hitachi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of broader cooperation," said a spokeswoman for IBM 
Japan, a subsidiary of the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two computer giants is of greater marketing than 
technological significance, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The pact between IBM and Hitachi is in marked contrast to the mood seven years 
ago, when a San Francisco court ordered Hitachi to pay an undisclosed sum after 
IBM accused Hitachi of industrial spying and copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will build on recent efforts by both companies to create a 
standard software operating system. The programs will be based on the Open 
Software Foundation's version of the Unix operating system.

West Germany's Lufthansa airline, barred since World War II from flying to 
Berlin, will start flights to the capital of a united Germany next month, 
taking over routes from Pan Am Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Lufthansa AG announced Monday that it had reached agreement to begin 
scheduled flights from several West German cities to Tegel Airport in West 
Berlin on Oct. 28, using leased Pan Am Corp. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, struggling to turn around its loss-making airline, said it would 
receive $150 million in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, backed by the U.S. and West German governments, will end one of the 
many Cold War anomalies imposed by the victorious Allies in Berlin. The United 
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France had maintained the sole right to 
fly in Berlin's airspace since 1945, closing potentially lucrative routes to 
the West German carrier.

STRESS: When principal Dan Graham's elementary school opens Thursday, more than 
half of its 600 pupils will have recently said goodby to a father or mother. . 
. . The school, run by the Irvine Unified district, serves the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, whence so many Marines have shipped out to Saudi Arabia. . . 
. To cope with children's stress, the school will have extra counselors and a 
psychologist and immediately encourage children to open up. Says Graham: "They 
need to realize that it's OK to feel angry, that it's the reason they're 
behaving differently." Kristina Lindgren and Tony Marcano

gains. "Historically, when employment gets tight, people go back to school," 
says one administrator. . . . Has it begun already? Opening-day enrollment at 
Orange Coast College, the county's biggest, was up 15%, but officials say they

FIRE STATION WORK PLANS MOVE AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to renovate two fire stations will move forward this month after a 
postponement due to the February oil spill and a bureaucratic snag, Fire Chief 
Raymond C. Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
Expansions of the Bushard Street and Gothard Street stations will mark the 
city's first efforts to accommodate its burgeoning firefighting staff since the 
construction of the city's seventh station in 1978, Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
The expansions will cost $193,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the Gothard Street station, south of Talbert Avenue, a battalion chief's 
office will be added, along with additional garage space for a yet-to-be 
purchased ladder truck. 
</P>
<P>
If enough money is left over after the Gothard station renovation, the city 
will expand the sleeping and bathroom quarters at the 25-year-old Bushard 
Street station near Yorktown Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The renovations, which had been in the works for years, were delayed further 
following the Feb. 7 offshore oil spill. Money that had been earmarked for the 
station expansions was redirected for the Fire Department's emergency-response 
and cleanup effort, Picard said. The city has since recovered a portion of the 
money it spent in the wake of the disaster from British Petroleum, owner of the 
spilled oil. 
</P>
<P>
Picard says he has a lengthy menu of renovations that have been indefinitely 
shelved due to lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list, he said, is the long-delayed Heil Avenue station relocation.

CITY'S FIRST SHELTER HELPS HOMELESS COPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just 18 months ago, Mary Jo and Ron were living comfortably in their 
one-bedroom Huntington Beach apartment. She was earning $2,100 per month at her 
word-processing job, and the couple was making plans for having their first 
child. 
</P>
<P>
But then came a devastating series of health, employment and financial 
setbacks. And by May, they faced eviction, bankruptcy and mounting medical 
bills for their infant son, David. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mary Jo and Ron, who requested their last name be withheld, were among 
the lucky ones. When they and young David were finally forced out of their 
apartment on Aug. 22, they were homeless for just a few hours, before locating 
temporary housing -- in a relatively cozy environment. 
</P>
<P>
They are one of two families who, along with a single woman, are sharing a home 
at Huntington Beach's first homeless shelter, which opened this month with the 
help of a $20,000 city grant. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter is the 11th such facility opened during the past four years by 
Shelter for the Homeless, a Westminster-based nonprofit organization. Each 
costs between $25,000 and $28,000 per year to run, which is paid chiefly 
through private donations, said Jim Miller, the organization's founder and 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The newest facility is a comfortable, rented home, not unlike the other 
sizable, well-kept houses in this middle-class neighborhood of northwest 
Huntington Beach. The four-bedroom, two-bathroom house is clean, furnished and 
spacious, and has a television, microwave oven and a large back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the living arrangements in the home are typical. Mary Jo and Ron 
share one bedroom, and David, who suffers from a respiratory disease and 
requires a bedside breathing monitor, has another bedroom to himself. The other 
family lives in the master bedroom, and the single resident stays in another of 
the smaller rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be allowed to live in the home for up to four months. During 
that time, Miller works with various agencies throughout the county to find 
them permanent jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to get people off the streets and give them a comfortable, decent 
place to live, and support them with finding employment . . . and assistance in 
permanent housing," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Shelter for the Homeless can assist only a handful of families and 
singles at a time, Miller says he chooses residents based on "their willingness 
to get a job and get back into the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
"With most of our families, there's just been a tragedy at this particular time 
in their lives," he said. "Because of a health reason or something else that's 
caused them to lose their apartment, they're out on the street. There are a lot 
of people who just can't afford $600 or $700 a month for an apartment. And in 
most cases, if they can just get through this peak crisis, they're able to go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
But, with an estimated 170 callers a day asking Miller for assistance, he 
acknowledges that those who ultimately receive housing are typically those who 
suddenly get lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a blessing for us," Mary Jo said. In addition to the couple's 
financial straits, they were particularly concerned about how homelessness 
might affect 7-month-old David, who suffers from apnea, a breathing problem 
during sleep that frequently leads to "crib death." 
</P>
<P>
"It feels funny to say I'm homeless, yet I don't feel homeless," Mary Jo said. 
"I look at it as very temporary until we can get back on our feet. Maybe the 
new year, 1991, will bring us a new home. Or maybe it will come as a Christmas 
present." JOHN PENNER

BLOWER FIRMS LOOK FOR SOUND SOLUTIONS

<P>
With tough regulations aimed at muffling noisy leaf blowers going into effect 
this month, manufacturers are preparing to comply with a law that they say 
could have a wide impact on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sept. 26, every leaf blower used in Irvine must pass a noise test 
considered the strictest in the nation. There are no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine just said, 'Hey guys, here's an ordinance, and you either have to live 
with it or people are going to have to use brooms,' " said Bob Krause, 
president of MHT Distributors of Pasadena, which distributes Redmax leaf 
blowers. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than switching to broom making, blower manufacturers have been making 
modifications in their machines. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, leaf blowers at maximum throttle may emit no more than 70 
decibels, as measured from 50 feet away. Most leaf blowers emit between 85 and 
105 decibels at maximum speed. 
</P>
<P>
After the City Council adopted the law in February, two manufacturers -- Redmax 
and TMC -- began providing leaf blowers with throttle restricters for their 
Irvine-area retailers. The restricters prevent the machines from operating at 
high speed, thereby reducing the amount of noise they can make. 
</P>
<P>
Distributors for those companies' leaf blowers have been bringing the machines 
to Irvine to have them tested and certified before they are sold to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Krause said that although the noise limit is difficult to meet, it probably 
will end up helping the industry by forcing manufacturers to come up with 
quieter models. 
</P>
<P>
Redmax, one of the brands Krause's company distributes, has benefited because 
it was the first company to produce a machine that meets Irvine's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been excellent for our business," he said. "I'm not complaining a bit." 
</P>
<P>
The city's ordinance is considered the nation's strictest because it requires 
that the noise measurement be taken near a wall to simulate real-life operating 
conditions. The wall reflects the noise, producing a higher reading on a sound 
meter. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine adopted the law after residents complained about the noise, dust and 
fumes leaf blowers create. The law also specifies that the blowers may only be 
used between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on 
Saturdays. Sunday use will be illegal. The law also prohibits the machines' 
being used within 10 feet of a window or door. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the law requires that anyone wishing to use a leaf blower commercially 
in the city take a city-sponsored 30-minute class (the classes will be taught 
in English and Spanish) to learn how to use them "safely, courteously and 
effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Any violation is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 or a jail 
term of 6 months or both. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping we can set an example for other cities," said Robert Storchheim, 
manager of the city's building and safety division. "If you've been around the 
city of Irvine long enough, you'll know we're always on the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of cities have asked for copies of the ordinance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a benchmark around the country," said Robin Pendergrast, an 
Illinois-based marketing representative for Redmax. "Is Irvine correct in doing 
this? Absolutely. They've had some horrible problems." 
</P>
<P>
If other cities do follow Irvine's example, Pendergrast said, manufacturers 
will be forced to produce quieter models. Previously, reducing the sound level 
had a low priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
TMC began devising a quieter model after Pasadena adopted an ordinance in 1988, 
said Larry Muronaka, service manager for TMC Power Equipment in Monterey Park. 
The company realized that the ordinance, one of the first to specify a maximum 
noise level, would be copied by other cities, Muronaka said. 
</P>
<P>
If more cities move toward regulating leaf blower noise, all manufacturers will 
eventually come out with quieter models, said Dale Kennedy, owner of Don's Lawn 
Mower Shop in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although most cities do not yet have such restrictions, Kennedy said, "I know a 
lot of the other cities are just looking at Irvine to see if their ordinance 
works." TOM McQUEENEY

MAN SURRENDERS AFTER BRIEF STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old Costa Mesa man on crutches surrendered to police after a brief 
standoff Monday morning with a police SWAT team, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the man, Randy Steve Malett, had threatened to kill two 
neighbors and had smashed the front window of the neighbors' home with one of 
his crutches, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Gunshots were also heard, but no weapon was found, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began, authorities said, when Malett had an argument late Sunday 
or early Monday with his neighbors, Christopher and Cynthia Laughery, at the 
Laugherys' residence in the 2200 block of Thurin Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Later, while watching television with roommates Kelly Ramey, 22, and Anthony 
Mondragon, 24, police said, Malett threatened to kill the Laugherys. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack said that at 3:50 a.m. Malett went outside, 
started a disturbance and used one of his crutches to smash the Laugherys' 
front window. Several people reported hearing gunshots but saw no weapon, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Warnack said Malett returned to his residence. Police, responding to a call 
about a disturbance and possible shots fired, evacuated Malett's roommates, 
including three small children. 
</P>
<P>
A SWAT unit and a crisis response team arrived at 5 a.m., Warnack said, and 
they set up a command post at the corner of Thurin and Victoria Street. A 
negotiation team telephoned Malett and he later surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Warnack said Malett was being held at the Costa Mesa jail on suspicion of 
disturbing the peace and malicious mischief. Bail was set at $500.

SCHOOLHOUSE STILL HAS LOTS TO TEACH AS IT NEARS 100 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of students will return to Rancho Canada Elementary School this week, 
leaving their modern suburban homes for modern classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But just across the street from the campus is the El Toro Grammar School, a 
one-room schoolhouse and one of the Orange County's few remaining reminders of 
what elementary education was like a century ago. In those days, because most 
children's parents were farmers, classes didn't start until the harvest was 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The school, now part of the Heritage Hill Historical Park, will celebrate its 
100th anniversary on Oct. 21 in a special ceremony re-enacting the original 
dedication. According to historian Jim Sleeper, the El Toro School is the 
oldest school still standing in Orange County. (A one-room schoolhouse at 
Knott's Berry Farm was built in 1875, but it was moved from Beloit, Kan., to be 
used as a museum at the amusement park.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the El Toro school is now a museum, the Victorian building still fills 
with fourth-graders many days during the school year. The students visit the 
Heritage Hill park beginning in October as part of their study of California 
history. Students dress in period clothing and re-enact part of a school day in 
that era, including being taught the basics, singing to the piano and going on 
recess. Students even take names of actual students who attended the school and 
learn a little about their families. 
</P>
<P>
"The first week (after Labor Day), we're booked for the whole year," said Dan 
Thomas, senior park ranger at Heritage Hill. "We don't even have to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
For any visitor, a walk inside is like a step back in time. 
</P>
<P>
The school seats only about 32 students, enough to house all the children in 
grades one through eight who lived in Saddleback Valley in those days. Desks 
vary in size depending upon which grade students are in. Blackboards line all 
four walls to accommodate each grade level. 
</P>
<P>
On the teacher's desk are a large red apple, fountain pens and the McGuffey's 
Reader, the basic instruction book of the day. The thicker the McGuffey volume, 
the higher the grade level. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls are period artifacts, each placed in the school building as if it 
were 1890. The U.S. flag has only 44 stars. The Pledge of Allegiance has 
slightly different words. A map on the school's wall reminds visitors that 
Thailand was then Siam, the Soviet Union was the Russian Empire and Iraq was 
just part of Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The schoolhouse was originally located at what was then the corner of 1st 
Street and Olive Avenue in El Toro. In 1914, the school closed when a new, 
two-room schoolhouse was constructed adjacent to it to house a growing student 
population. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the original El Toro Grammar School became St. Anthony's Catholic 
Church and was moved nearby to El Toro Road. It remained there until 1968. 
During the early 1970s, the schoolhouse building was unoccupied and heavily 
vandalized. It was donated to Orange County in 1976 and moved to Heritage Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who plan to attend the 100th anniversary celebration at the park is 
George Osterman, who went to the school from 1907 to 1912 for fourth through 
eighth grades. He recalls that the school was in a remote area in the county. 
Rules in the classroom were strict. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to say it was 'reading, writing and arithmetic taught to the tune of a 
hickory stick,' " said Osterman, 92, who now lives in Santa Ana. "The teachers 
carried a buggy whip." 
</P>
<P>
Much also was made of keeping boys away from girls. Boys entered through a 
cloak room to the right of the main entrance, the girls to the left. The main 
entrance was reserved for teachers and their parents. On shelves in the cloak 
rooms were tin tobacco cans, that day's version of school lunch boxes, and 
washbasins. 
</P>
<P>
"They would come back from recess either too dirty of sweaty," said park ranger 
Thomas. "The teacher made them clean up." 
</P>
<P>
But the rules were equally stringent for teachers -- men or women in their late 
teens and early 20s hoping to teach someday in schools in bigger towns. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall in the school is a list of guidelines for the teachers. One reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Any teacher who smokes, uses liquor in any form, frequents pool or public 
halls or gets shaved in a barber shop will give good reason to suspect his 
worth, intention, integrity and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
And the closest thing to a teachers' pension plan was written advice for what 
to do with each $75-a-month paycheck: 
</P>
<P>
"Every teacher should lay aside from each pay a goodly sum of earnings for his 
benefit during his declining years so that he will not become a burden on 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everything was as strict as today. Dress codes in particular were 
more lax, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"They could come in dirty Levis and no shoes," Thomas said. "Their shirt didn't 
have to be tucked in." 
</P>
<P>
Osterman remembers that for farmers, money was so tight it often was impossible 
to buy a new pair of shoes or pants. 
</P>
<P>
"If your pants wore through, you just put a patch over it," he said. "In 1907, 
we had a panic. Not a depression, but a panic. . . . No one had money to go out 
and get a new pair of pants." TED JOHNSON

HUNTINGTON BEACH COUNCIL TO ACT ON LIBRARY PROPOSAL 
</P>

<P>
The City Council is scheduled to act tonight on a recommendation that the 
city's public library system be made a separate department of city government. 
</P>
<P>
The library system currently is part of the Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga has proposed making the library system a 
separate entity to "improve communication, effectiveness and efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga also proposed that incumbent Library Director Ron Hayden be named as 
the head of the new Library Department. No changes in city budget or staff 
salaries for anyone would be involved, Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental change involved is one of a reporting relationship, whereby 
the library director will now be reporting directly to the city administrator 
instead of the community services director," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a separate department for the library system has been strongly 
endorsed by the city's Library Board of Trustees and also by the Library 
Patrons Foundations, Friends of the Library and Friends of the Children's 
Library of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe the library should be an autonomous department best served 
by reporting to the city manager," said Dorothy Silverman, president of Friends 
of the Library. "The library provides distinctive services which should not be 
grouped with dissimilar services." BILL BILLITER

PEOPLE: HE HAS A WAY OF BOUNCING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have a strong heart, it's kind of fun watching Paul D. McKinnon do his 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, he's been been jumping off bridges, such as the 200-foot-high Vincent 
Thomas Bridge in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has leaped off 14 bridges and plans more adventurous jumps in 
England, which he will visit starting Saturday as a delegate to the World 
Congress of Chiropractic Students. 
</P>
<P>
He is part of the latest craze of Bungee jumping -- leaping off something and, 
hopefully, being pulled up just short of the ground by an elastic-type tether 
attached to the feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to a make a 600-foot fall," he said. "I see that as a big-time jump." 
</P>
<P>
And get this. McKinnon says it's his way of overcoming fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of was afraid of height," said the La Habra chiropractic student who 
also operates a local house-sitting business. "It's a wonderful, challenging 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
McKinnon believes that if people jumped off bridges, they would lessen their 
fears, helping them to be more successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know I can do anything I want to do," he said. "If you break one fear, 
you can break all the others. Your fear turns into exhilaration when the air 
rushes by you." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the jump, he said, "you just feel a gentle tug. It's almost like 
flying without an airplane." 
</P>
<P>
His support group pulls him up. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's big on bridge jumping, McKinnon also likes roller-blading, a new 
type of roller-skating using skates with four wheels lined up behind each other 
rather than two wheels side by side. 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey players and speed skaters use them for conditioning during the 
off-season," said McKinnon, who recently completed a 102.7-mile, roller-blading 
trip to San Diego in 8 hours and 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He started at the Huntington Beach Pier and finished at the entrance to Sea 
World in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He asked chiropractors to donate 25 cents a mile for each mile he roller-bladed 
to finance the $1,500 needed for his England trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out asking only chiropractors to help me so I could develop a 
rapport with them since that's going to be my life's work," said the one-time 
amateur hockey player who had thoughts of becoming a professional. 
</P>
<P>
But McKinnon was forced to seek donations from other professionals to meet his 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to be a chiropractor was prompted by a sports injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffered a back injury and was told I wouldn't be able to play hockey any 
more," he said. "Besides, I'm only 5 foot, 8 inches tall and that's too small 
for the pros." 
</P>
<P>
He was facing back surgery until he received treatment from a chiropractor who, 
he said, not only helped him physically but helped him decide his life's work. 
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said he was once a premed student with a full scholarship, 
</P>
<P>
"But I decided that being a chiropractor was the best thing I could do to help 
a lot more people," he said. "I like the hands-on approach without doing 
surgery." 
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said he has a number of visions and goals, including a mission to 
promote good health through diet, exercise and education. 
</P>
<P>
One of his goals is to become the team chiropractic doctor for the Los Angeles 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of hockey players use chiropractors to help keep them fit," he noted.

<P>
There are two significant numbers to remember when analyzing the South Coast 
League and its prospects for the 1990 Division II football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Three is the number of outstanding quarterbacks returning for their senior 
season. Rob Johnson of El Toro, Tony Solliday of Capistrano Valley and Tim 
Snowden of Mission Viejo all rank among the best in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a backup to all-county quarterback Steve Stenstrom as a junior, 
completing 20 of 25 passes for 550 yards. But Johnson was a beneficiary of 
Stenstrom's success, earning all-county honors as a wide receiver with 61 
receptions for 1,069 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the top athlete in the county as a junior, earned all-Southern Section 
honors in football, basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday led Capistrano Valley to an undefeated record and the top ranking in 
the county in 10 games, passing for 1,749 yards and 13 touchdowns. He came out 
firing in Hawaii last week, passing for 221 yards and three touchdowns against 
Honolulu Damien. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden threw for 2,400 yards and 18 touchdowns in 13 games for Mission Viejo, 
including a 352-yard performance in the Division III semifinals against El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't find a league anywhere in Southern California with three better 
quarterbacks," San Clemente Coach Dave Elecciri said. "The defensive backs in 
this league are going to have to be on their toes for every play." 
</P>
<P>
Seven is the number of teams competing in the re-aligned Division II that 
advanced last year to the semifinals in postseason play and came within an 
eyelash of earning a berth in a championship game. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo played in overtime games in the 
Division III semifinals. El Toro beat Mission Viejo, 28-21, and Capistrano 
Valley lost to Paramount, 36-35, when eventual champion Paramount scored a 
two-point conversion on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast League was elevated to Division II this season, and if the 
coaches felt reaching the title game was difficult last year, there will be 
more competition this season. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara also played in overtime games in the 
semifinals last year. Muir defeated Thousand Oaks, 9-3, and Santa Barbara edged 
Canyon Country in a highly controversial game, 28-27. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Country, a member of the Golden League, is now competing in Division I 
and opened its season last week with a 40-0 victory over host Honolulu St. 
Louis. The victory ended St. Louis' 55-game winning streak that spanned five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The division is the toughest in the CIF (Southern Section) and a road trip to 
Santa Barbara, Muir or Thousand Oaks will make it just that much tougher," El 
Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, El Toro, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo are expected to compete 
for the title in the county's strongest league. How strong is it? Last year, 
Dana Hills swept past five nonleague opponents and managed to win only two 
league games. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the same three this year," Johnson said. "But Irvine or Dana Hills 
is capable of winning on any given night." 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY -- Solliday was named to the underclassman all-state team by 
Cal-Hi sports as a junior and looked sharp in the season opener against Damien, 
completing seven consecutive passes at one point in the second quarter. Patton, 
the coach's youngest son, caught five passes for 98 yards, including touchdowns 
of 30 and 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Brion is unquestionably the most talented player on the team. He 
intercepted three passes against Damien and mistimed his leap for another 
errant pass or he would have had four. He also led the team with 58 yards 
rushing in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our passing game will be strong," Patton said. "I think Tony is the top 
returning quarterback in the league and he didn't do anything to change my 
opinion in Hawaii." Patton gave his team a "B-minus" for its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
DANA HILLS -- Slowly but surely, the Dolphins are inching closer to The Big 
Three. Two years ago, Dana Hills beat Capistrano Valley for the first time. 
Last year, the Dolphins earned a playoff berth. This year, the school has grown 
to 2,489 students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a chance to be in the hunt for the league title," Douglass 
said. "We have a big, strong offensive line and some quickness on defense. El 
Toro is the favorite, but I think second and third place is up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Coleman was a second-team all-league selection at linebacker as a junior, 
and Douglass says he has the potential to become an all-county player. 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO -- The Chargers were the county's most successful team in the '80s, 
winning three divisional championships and six league titles. The trend should 
continue into the '90s, as El Toro's sophomore team was 9-1 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a starting quarterback on the freshman and sophomore teams, returns to 
his natural position, leaving a gap at wide receiver. The Chargers have 
developed some of the county's top receivers in the past decade, but Bret 
Sanders is the only quality receiver on the team, and he moved to tailback when 
Danny Maestas suffered a knee injury last week. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro has four down linemen and four linebackers returning. Brian Haas and 
Jeremy Hogue are being touted as all-county players, but linebacker Mike Nelson 
has been the most impressive defensive player in camp. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE -- The Vaqueros opened the '89 season with a promising 19-3 victory over 
cross-town rival University and then lost four of their next five games and 
never recovered. Irvine managed only 32 points in those four defeats, prompting 
a quarterback change. 
</P>
<P>
Deron McCoy, last year's starter, moves to safety and Chicago transfer Jason 
Minici will start at quarterback. Coach Terry Henigan has discarded the 
run-oriented Delaware Wing-T in favor of the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be different this year," Henigan said. "We'll two-platoon with 
no player going both ways, which we've never done at Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing hasn't changed: "The defense is way ahead of the offense," 
Henigan added. 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO -- The Diablos have qualified for the playoffs 13 consecutive 
seasons. Mike Rush begins his third year with a 22-4 record and one league 
title. But the varsity's mark of 10-3 was only fourth-best on the campus last 
year. The freshman team was 10-0, the sophomore team was 10-0 and the junior 
varsity team was 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's nonleague schedule includes three games against San Diego 
Section teams. The Diablos play road games at Rancho Buena Vista, El Camino and 
Crawford. Rancho Buena Vista and El Camino won section titles last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have an explosive offense with Snowden, a big line and some 
talented receivers returning," Rush said. "We're going to have to rebuild the 
defense with only two starters returning, but we have some fine talent coming 
up." 
</P>
<P>
SAN CLEMENTE -- Ken Dolan is the league's fourth returning quarterback. Dolan, 
a top pitching prospect on the Tritons' baseball team, completed 54 of 137 
passes for 626 yards in nine games as a junior. San Clemente scored only 26 
points in five league games. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken is the first returning quarterback I've had here," Elecciri said. "We'll 
be much improved on offense. We have a good group of juniors, but they have no 
varsity experience." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Budde, a former All-American at USC and a Pro Bowl selection for the 
Kansas City Chiefs, has joined the staff.

</P>
<P>
Outlook: Brion, a two-year all-league safety, will double at tailback, 
replacing graduated Paul Shaheen. The Cougars have excellent speed at the 
skilled positions and Solliday starts his third year at quarterback. Adams will 
miss at least four games with a strained vertebra in his lower back. Mosebrook 
will anchor a strong defense but the big question is the offensive line, with 
only two starters returning. Capistrano Valley meets El Toro in its league

Outlook: Dana Hills won only two league games but earned an at-large berth in 
the Division III playoffs last year based on five nonleague victories. It will 
be difficult to match the nonleague sweep this year with the addition of 
Division I schools Fountain Valley and Long Beach Millikan. "Our goal is to 
make the playoffs on our own doing rather than getting an at-large berth," 
Douglass said. The team's strength is the offensive line and overall defensive 
quickness, but it will be difficult replacing all-league running back Matt 
Carvalho.

<P>
Outlook: Maestas, an all-league honorable mention tailback, will be out three 
to five weeks with a knee injury suffered in practice a week ago. Bret Sanders, 
the team's top wide receiver, has replaced Maestas. Bob Johnson is predicting 
that seven or eight players will eventually sign with Division I schools and 
three of his starters -- Johnson, Hogue and Haas -- have been listed in most 
scouting publications.

<P>
Outlook: Hargrove, a first-team all-league selection, is the standout on the

starting quarterback, moves to free safety. Sophomore Garcia and Minici, a 
transfer from Chicago, are vying for McCoy's quarterback position. Shad 
Vickers, the team's top offensive weapon the past two years, transferred to 
Tustin. The team's strength is at linebacker, where Stammer and Webb are 
Division I prospects.

Outlook: Mission Viejo has stumbled in the semifinals of the playoffs five 
times in the past six years, losing a memorable 28-21 overtime game to El Toro 
last year. Mission Viejo got past the semifinals in 1985 but lost to Santa Ana, 
32-21, in the title game. "Our goal is to win one more game in the playoffs 
than we've done the past six years," Rush said. LeBreton set a school record 
with 14 sacks and Denny intercepted two passes for touchdowns in '89.

</P>
<P>
Outlook: San Clemente has struggled to a 2-24 record in the league over the 
past five seasons and hasn't won a league game in three years. The streak 
likely will continue this year but relief is in sight. The Tritons' sophomore 
team finished 5-5 last year, its best record in 10 seasons. The return of 
quarterback Dolan and the addition of Steve Castle as offensive coordinator 
will also improve the Tritons' four-points-per-game average in league last 
year.

HEALTH CARE: STRAPPED MEDICAL FACILITIES OPEN MENTAL WINGS TO TRY TO STAY IN

<TEXT>
<P>
Since Buena Park Community Hospital shut down its money-losing medical surgical 
business three years ago and converted to a psychiatric hospital, it has 
managed to stop its losses and even eke out a small profit most of the time. 
But it's not exactly thriving. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's health-care market, if you are breaking even or making a small 
profit, you are doing all right," said Earl Bernard, administrator of the 
facility that is doing extensive national advertising and offering discounted 
rates. "At least we aren't closing." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park is only one of many hospitals in Orange County and throughout the 
United States that have turned to psychiatric care to fill unused medical beds 
and reduce expenses. 
</P>
<P>
While mental health beds produce slightly less revenue than medical beds, they 
are far less expensive to operate and thus are considered potentially more 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of finding an easy solution to their financial woes, hospitals that 
dive into psychiatric care are landing in the middle of yet another medical 
industry in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Medical insurers, who several years ago began a push for more efficient use of 
general hospitals, are now turning their attention to the fast-rising costs of 
psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
And that push for cost controls is having a similar effect on mental health 
care as it has had on general medicine: encouragement of more outpatient 
treatment and shorter hospital stays. 
</P>
<P>
Greater use of outpatient treatment and the influx of new psychiatric beds are 
hurting long-established psychiatric hospital programs in Orange County. Some 
have watched their patient count drop by as much as half. 
</P>
<P>
"We are barely eking out an existence," said Dr. Thomas Swanson, medical 
director of the 15-year-old psychiatric program at South Coast Medical Center 
in Laguna Beach. Even as business has become tougher, the number of mental 
health beds in the county has grown sharply. Not only are existing medical beds 
being converted, but some national psychiatric hospital chains are building 
large new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surplus of psychiatric beds has emerged in such states as 
California, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, which in recent years have 
lifted restrictions on new beds and opened the market to all comers. 
</P>
<P>
Since California lifted its restrictions in 1987, Orange County has become a 
prime target for expansion of national hospital chains such as Community 
Psychiatric Centers, Charter Medical and Psychiatric Institutes of America, 
part of National Medical Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The major chains -- hoping to outdo the existing competition and gain a 
foothold in a comparatively wealthy and fast-growing area -- have largely 
ignored state planners' reports that show the county has more psychiatric beds 
than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the number of psychiatric beds increased from 889 in 1985 to 
1,473 today, while the average bed occupancy rate has declined, according to 
local hospitals and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of psychiatric beds in general hospitals has risen from 
1,259 in 1984 to 1,858, according to the National Assn. of Private Psychiatric 
Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, four Orange County hospitals -- Buena Park Community, 
Yorba Hills Hospital and Medical Center, Midwood Community Hospital and College 
Hospital Costa Mesa -- have converted 318 beds to psychiatric uses. 
</P>
<P>
Community Psychiatric Centers opened a 78-bed hospital in Laguna Hills in 1988, 
and two months ago it bought a rebuilt psychiatric hospital in Brea with 151 
beds, only 35 of which are currently occupied. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest shock to the local industry, however, came in April when Charter 
Medical of Macon, Ga., entered the county by opening two new facilities 
totaling 200 beds in Fountain Valley and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Most people in the industry expect a "shakeout" of hospitals in Orange County, 
with some psychiatric units shutting down or converting to yet another use, 
such as skilled nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at all four psychiatric facilities in South Orange County, where bed 
occupancy ranges between 25% and 50%, predict that ultimately at least one of 
their competitors will fold. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is doing less business than they thought they would," said Bud 
Brown, marketing director for the new Charter Hospital of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
To shore up profits, the county's psychiatric facilities are trimming their 
staffs to reduce costs. They also are developing a variety of outpatient and 
partial hospitalization programs designed to satisfy the demands of medical 
insurers and managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they are trying to distinguish themselves from the competition by 
creating specialized programs in such areas as depression, phobias, eating 
disorders, children's counseling and Christian-oriented psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, we didn't have marketing directors. Marketing was a bad word," 
said Ken Barry Dyches, senior vice president of operations for Community 
Psychiatric Centers based in Laguna Hills. "But in today's environment, 
marketing is a means of survival," 
</P>
<P>
Specialization has worked wonders for Western Medical Center Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Western Medical contracted with New Life Treatment Centers in 
Laguna Beach to introduce a mental health program that includes prayer 
sessions, Bible study and counseling by clergy. The result: Occupancy rates at 
its 82-bed adult and adolescent units have nearly doubled to 59%, up from about 
30% in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's psychiatric facilities also are marketing their services to 
health maintenance organizations, insurance companies and mental health 
professionals, who have the ability to provide hospitals with their lifeblood 
-- patient referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Irwin Rosenfeld, past president of the Orange County Psychiatric Society, 
said psychiatric hospitals are hiring more psychiatrists as part-time 
administrators to bring in new business, starting with their own patients. 
</P>
<P>
Taking this strategy one step further, Midwood Community Hospital in Stanton, a 
101-bed facility converting to all-psychiatric care, is selling ownership 
shares in the hospital to psychiatrists, psychologists, family counselors and 
other mental health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Bruck, a consultant to Midwood on the private offering, said the 
facility hopes to have 40 or 50 mental health professionals as owners by the 
end of September. 
</P>
<P>
While hundreds of psychiatric beds are empty in Orange County, the 165 beds in 
county mental health facilities designated for indigent patients are full, and 
only the most severely disturbed who require a secure environment are receiving 
hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness, vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, said the contrast between the surplus of beds in the 
private sector and the shortage in the public "suggests there is a marriage 
waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
But county officials say public agencies don't have the money to lease the 
private beds. 
</P>
<P>
If all those requiring psychiatric treatment had the insurance to pay for it, 
Langness said, "there wouldn't be an empty bed in all of California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PSYCHIATRIC BED CENSUS 
</P>
<P>
The number of psychiatric beds in Orange County increased from 889 in 1985 to 
1,473 today, local hospitals report. Meanwhile average occupancy rate has 
declined, causing financial problems for some institutions.

LORAL CORP. PLANS TO CONTINUE RENTING FORD AEROSPACE SITE

<P>
By 1996, Loral Corp. will be paying $1-million-a-month rent for the 99-acre 
property where Ford Aerospace Corp.'s Newport Beach defense plant is located 
under a sublease with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
That rent might be stiff enough to inspire Loral, a New York-based defense 
contractor that is buying Ford Aerospace, to move the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Ford has been leasing the land on a long-term lease since 1958 at what were 
thought to be very low rates. 
</P>
<P>
Loral will start out paying $92,000 a month through mid-1995 for the site, 
according to the sublease. 
</P>
<P>
The rent then jumps to $550,000 per month and goes up to $1 million from 1996 
through 1998, when the sublease expires. 
</P>
<P>
The land, which belongs to the Irvine Co., could probably be profitably 
developed as a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But Loral officials say the company will stay in Newport Beach for at least the 
eight years of the sublease. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll stay on as long as we can and look for an appropriate solution at the 
end of the eight years," Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz said recently. "The 
people out here are going to have to solve that problem. We in New York are not 
going to solve that problem."

BREAKING TIES THAT BIND;

<P>
GANGS: FOUR FORMER MEMBERS RECALL THE DIFFICULTIES THEY OVERCAME IN GETTING 
AWAY TO START NEW AND INDEPENDENT LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Why do young men and women join groups of apparently aimless, often angry and 
violent neighborhood youths? Because for many, the penalty for not becoming a 
"homeboy" or "homegirl" can mean anything from ostracism to death. And it is 
not an alliance one simply walks away from when one has had enough. The bonds 
are often blood bonds and such disloyalty is often considered the greatest sin. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of this passion can be tragic. There were more homicides in 
Orange County that were attributed to gangs by May of this year than in all of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is possible to leave that frightful world and succeed, sometimes 
grandly. Here are four people who have done it: 
</P>
<P>
 When 33-year-old Gus Frias goes to visit the friends of his youth, he knows 
exactly where to find them -- close together on the same Montebello hillside, 
their likenesses, etched in gray marble, staring up at him from their 
gravestones. 
</P>
<P>
There's Miguel Garcia, the leader of the old neighborhood who saved his life 
several times, and the brothers Ronnie and Bobby Figueroa, and Frias' best 
friend of all, Paul Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
They were victims of what Frias calls "the madness," the deadly cycle of 
internecine warfare in the gritty East Los Angeles barrio of Maravilla. They 
weren't gangsters, says Frias. They hadn't banded together with criminal 
intentions. They became an identifiable group because they came from the same 
barrio and they were engulfed by ancient blood feuds between rival families and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a fraternity," he says. "Fraternities at universities are formed for 
the purpose of giving support, guidance, identity to every single brother and 
when a brother needs something, you have all these other brothers who come to 
the rescue. In the barrio, it's the same thing, but it's taken a step further 
in that all of us are willing to give our lives for each other." 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, you never truly stop being a homeboy, even if you get a pair of 
degrees from USC, even if you become a cop or an author, even if you become a 
teacher or a community activist. Even if you become a national finalist for a 
White House Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
Frias has done all that. Today he is the manager of Operation Safe Schools, a 
program against drugs and gangs that is affiliated with the Orange County 
Department of Education. He also teaches a course at UC Irvine intended to 
instruct educators about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
He also used to pack a gun to school and became known as an "arsenal man" in 
his barrio, one who always knew how to obtain weapons. He was a homeboy, he 
says, because he had to be, because it was the only way to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"You live in those projects," he says, "and automatically you have to learn to 
survive. You're bred to believe that you're not going to become a victim. If 
that meant packing a gun to school, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
He never shot anyone. Instead, he says, he became more and more horrified as, 
one by one, his friends were cut down around him. 
</P>
<P>
His family, he says, had instilled strong positive values in him, but when his 
best friend was shot to death during Frias' junior year in high school, he 
began to look for a way out. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of my friends were killed," he says, "and that was enough to make 
me think. I was losing my childhood friends to the madness." 
</P>
<P>
Also, one of his teachers at Garfield High School convinced him that he had the 
potential to go on to college. He became the school's student body president 
and later was accepted not only at USC, but at Harvard and Stanford. He chose 
USC, where he was offered work-study scholarships and fellowships, because it 
was close to his barrio. 
</P>
<P>
He made high grades at USC, where he found the academic challenge did not 
compare to the challenge of growing up as an "arsenal man" in the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
"What were the consequences for failing at USC, a letter grade of F?" he said. 
"The consequence for failing in the barrio was death." 
</P>
<P>
With his bachelor's degree in political science and his master's degree in 
public administration, he took jobs first as a special assistant to the West 
Covina chief of police and later as an area adjutant in the Hollywood division 
of the Los Angeles Police Department. He expects that his current job with the 
Orange County Department of Education will not satisfy him forever. He says he 
wants to be elected to national public office someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a dreamer," says Frias, "and a person who dreams, fights like hell for the 
rest of his life to achieve them. I think the best of me is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
Still, his past occasionally dogs him. Shortly after he completed his 
autobiographical book, "Barrio Warriors," in the early 1980s, he says he was 
threatened with death by veteranos -- Maravilla locals whom Frias called "adult 
thugs who perpetuate the self-destruction" -- because he had heaped scorn on 
them, and they felt he had made public "things that were considered secret, 
part of the nether world." 
</P>
<P>
Shots have been fired at his car and his house, he says, and two years ago, on 
his way to make a presentation at a school, he was struck by a car in front of 
his house in what he says was a deliberate attempt on his life. He spent 36 
hours in intensive care as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes with the territory," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Frias says such events have not slowed him. He continues to move forward, but 
always takes the time to look back, to visit his many friends who lie in 
Resurrection Cemetery, to remember that he is still a homeboy. 
</P>
<P>
"The cemetery tends to remind us a lot of what life is about," he says, looking 
around the hill. "We're here temporarily. We have to learn how to live and 
survive, to make the best of our days, to help our brothers and sisters who are 
lost and confused. I wish I could do more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DOROTHY CASTILLO 
</P>
<P>
She started out as the kid who was different. She was the one the neighborhood 
girls taunted, insulted, beat up almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't become one of them because she didn't like what she saw, didn't like 
the hard-edged world of the girls in the gang jackets with the beehive hair and 
false eyelashes and double layers of white eye shadow who hung out on the 
corner at night and cruised the streets with their boyfriends in the 
hardscrabble Fullerton barrio known as Fullerton Toker's Town, or FTT. 
</P>
<P>
But in junior high school, you can only take so much of being ostracized, only 
suffer so many beatings. So, when she was 12 years old, Dorothy Castillo gave 
in and joined a group of girls who called themselves the Emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
"I had unbelievable peer pressure," says Castillo, now 36, a college student 
and a field representative for the Women in Community Services Job Corps, which 
is federally funded through the Department of Labor and provides free job 
training for the economically disadvantaged. "It's so intense that it actually 
changes your whole life. The kids follow you to school, they make fun of you, 
they push you when you're walking, they call you names. And they don't just get 
to you, they get to your family, your sisters, your brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you don't even know you're in class sometimes because you're so 
worried about what they're going to do to you next. And when you live in their 
area, it makes it worse. You have to claim that area or else." 
</P>
<P>
But when she put on the jacket and met the gang on the corner at night (she 
often had to sneak out of her parents' house to do it), everything changed. She 
had shown her solidarity with her neighbors, with her barrio. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her supervision at home was minimal. Her father worked days, her 
mother nights. She cut classes often to hang out with her friends. Her grades 
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
But during her last two years of high school, Castillo grew apart from the 
Emeralds and disassociated herself with the group. And she suddenly became 
worse than invisible. She was not only shunned completely by her former 
friends, as well as by a second, similar group of girls (who once again began 
jeering and beating her regularly), but no one at the entire school would speak 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
Her isolation ended -- and, she realizes now, her life's direction began to 
shift -- near the end of her high school years in 1971, when she got into a 
fight with a girl who had insulted her family. The police broke up the fight 
and took her home to face her parents. It was, she says, the first time her 
parents had any idea she had been involved with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
But, she says, "it was the first time I got recognition. I'd shown that I 
wasn't going to take anything anymore and I started getting respect. These kids 
can torment you to the point where you just explode." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the opportunity to escape the barrio came, in the form of a 
marriage proposal from a Marine stationed at El Toro (where she worked in food 
service), she took it and moved to Anaheim. She had a daughter and a son, but 
the marriage failed after five years. She and the children moved back with her 
parents in FTT. 
</P>
<P>
She was older, wiser and tougher, however, and decided to go back to school at 
Fullerton College. She took classes in criminal justice and got As. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," she says. "I couldn't believe I was intelligent. I 
never thought I could do it before." 
</P>
<P>
She married a second time, and had another daughter, but after two years that 
marriage also failed. 
</P>
<P>
She took a job counseling with the now-defunct Turning Point Gang Project in 
Orange County and decided to make a career in the field of human services, in 
particular counseling the parents of present or potential gang members. She is 
working toward her degree in human services at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Castillo has seen family history repeat itself. Her oldest 
daughter, now 16, had felt the relentless pressure to ally herself with 
Fullerton gang life since she was a child. The fact that her mother was 
counseling gangs in Anaheim, considered by several Fullerton gang members to be 
disloyal to her home barrio, only caused the insults and beatings to increase, 
and the Castillo house was the target of incessant harassing and threatening 
phone calls. And Castillo's daughter, in her early teens, began to take on the 
mantle of local gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo and her children have since moved to western Orange County and severed 
ties with the gangs. She makes a point of spending time with her children and 
knowing about their activities and friends and, through her job, wants to make 
sure that other parents do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt what I had to go through was something that I had to learn in order to 
help people now," she says. "If I can beat what I went through, and what my 
daughter went through, I can help other parents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMADOR CORONA 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his Santa Ana law office, Amador Corona can't help thinking of the 
film "Stand and Deliver" when he recalls his high school years in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Corona had allied himself with a gang (the members thought of it as a club) 
called Thee Uniters in the west Santa Ana barrio known as Silver Acres. He 
partied with them on weekends, cruised in their cars, wore their colors, drank 
with them in local parks. 
</P>
<P>
But he had always made good grades in school, and his gang status didn't change 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that I was fortunate about," says Corona, 35, who practices criminal 
and personal injury law and has a second office in Corona, "was that school was 
easy for me all along. Even though I was in a gang, I was still getting As. I 
was taking college prep courses with this club jacket on and that looked 
unusual to a lot of teachers. They'd say, 'Are you sure you're supposed to be 
in this class?' The jacket implied something to them that was generally 
negative. They thought I belonged in wood shop or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
But, like the intelligent but overlooked high school students in "Stand and 
Deliver," Corona belonged on the honor roll. Officials at UC Irvine thought so 
too, and accepted him as an undergraduate biology student. 
</P>
<P>
This was all but unheard of in his circle of friends. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a cross section of guys," Corona says. "You had the ones who were 
the tough guys always looking for trouble, then you had the other guys who were 
only interested in going to parties and looking for girls. There were guys who 
were interested in cars. For me, it was the parties and the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us individually would get in trouble with the law for drinking or 
fighting, but our rivalries with other gangs were more in terms of who was the 
best dressed or the best dancers. We were small and we never would have 
survived if we would have tried to be the toughest. There were certainly 
neighborhoods where we weren't welcome." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't feel particularly welcome at UCI either. He lived on campus, and the 
life there was unlike any he had known. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was on an island out there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that he had chosen a major for which, he later realized, he was 
unsuited. His grades in biology were mediocre and, he says, one academic 
counselor suggested that he should leave the university. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he changed his major to social ecology, and obtained his bachelor's 
degree. Then UCLA accepted him into its law school. He was the first member of 
his family ever to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
During his college years, he became gradually disassociated from his old gang. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like in a marriage where your interests change and you're no 
longer compatible," he says. "Part of it was the opportunity to see a different 
part of the world and a different lifestyle. That's what I think a lot of 
people in gangs and who live in barrios could benefit from." 
</P>
<P>
For other members of the old gang, such a vision never materialized. Corona 
remembers one member who became a chiropractor, and others who now drive trucks 
or work in construction, but he also remembers several who "got into alcohol 
and never got out of that, and others who have been in and out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
For Corona, however, meeting the challenge of living in two worlds propelled 
him to success. 
</P>
<P>
"What I liked," he says, "was being able to show the teachers that what they 
originally thought about Mexicans was probably wrong and what they thought 
about club or gang members wasn't necessarily true. With me, they couldn't say 
that all gang members were drive-by shooters or drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEPHANIE LOPEZ 
</P>
<P>
Everybody expected Stephanie Lopez to fail and, for the better part of her 
young life, she obliged them. 
</P>
<P>
Her alcoholic stepfather beat her. Her mother repeatedly told her she was 
stupid. So did her teachers in Las Vegas, N.M. One of them actually assigned 
her to an arbitrary group of supposedly slow students he called "the dumb 
bunnies." 
</P>
<P>
"You're stupid at home, you're stupid at school, you're an outcast, you're one 
of the dumb bunnies, so you say, 'All right,' " says Lopez. "You have to have 
some friends and one of mine was the bottle. I was drunk every weekend. I was 
an alcoholic by the time I was in junior high." 
</P>
<P>
She also identified herself with the gang that claimed Las Vegas' Camp Street 
as its territory. She took a street name that she often sprayed on walls and 
buildings: La Snoopy. 
</P>
<P>
"They called me that," she says, "because I always wanted to know everything. 
When I sprayed it on a wall, that was me, that was my identity." 
</P>
<P>
It was a small way to chip away at the deep sense of alienation from the 
academic and social world around her, where if you were Latino, "people's 
expectations were that you would dig ditches or work at a sewing machine or 
raise a family. The schools would socialize you to fail. High school was an 
incredible racist experience." 
</P>
<P>
Today, La Snoopy, she of the inquisitive mind, is 38, lives in Irvine, has 
bachelor's and master's degrees in speech communications from Cal State 
Fullerton, a second master's degree in comparative cultures from UC Irvine, and 
is working at UCI toward her Ph.D. in the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
But while she was in high school, her grades seldom rose above Ds, she says. 
She hung out with the gang, ratted her hair, got into fights where knives and 
razors bristled, "did defiant, malicious things." She became known as a girl 
who would never back down when playing "chicken" in a car. Once, while she was 
driving drunk, her car and another crashed at an intersection. She was ordered 
to report to a probation officer for a year after that. 
</P>
<P>
One New Year's Eve Lopez nearly died after passing out drunk and being taken to 
a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Then she discovered chess. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was making bad grades in high school," she says, "there was a Chicano 
counselor who taught me the game. He really cared. He showed me that I wasn't 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
She quickly became the state junior chess champion. 
</P>
<P>
That success, in part, inspired her to attend the University of New Mexico 
after high school. However, "even though I was highly intelligent, I hadn't 
been given the skills I needed to survive (in college)," she says, "and I fell 
flat on my face the first time out." 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Southern California, where she thought she would have a better 
chance at a job. She began working in a drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1979, a friend urged her to try for a degree a second time, at 
Cerritos College. This time, more worldly wise, she began making straight As 
and obtained an AA degree in fashion. While at Cerritos, however, she competed 
on the debate team with such success that she was offered a debate scholarship 
to Cal State Fullerton, where she worked for her speech communication degrees. 
After four years at UCI, she is nearing completion of her doctorate studies. 
She intends to teach courses in comparative cultures at the university level. 
</P>
<P>
She has earned scholarships throughout her college career. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she is trying to make sure other Latino youths are inspired to do the 
same. She has been working with various community service projects in the 
Orange County barrios since she was an undergraduate at Cal State Fullerton. In 
1985, she proposed the idea of a summer camp, funded by private businesses, 
where barrio youths could learn, among other things, that there are 
alternatives to gangs and a life without self-esteem. The first Camp Escalera 
(Spanish for ladder) was held last summer at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to leave something behind that will make a difference," she says. "We 
have to make a moral investment in our system of education and build bridges 
rather than walls. These people aren't lazy, they've just been socialized to 
poverty. I tell them that there's much more power in a library than there is in 
a .45 automatic."

COACH HOUSE SHOW PROVES B.B. IS STILL KING OF BLUES

<P>
The talk was that the "King of the Blues," B.B. King, had run out of steam and, 
these days, was just going through the motions. Don't you believe it. 
</P>
<P>
The blues singer/guitarist's well-received first set Sunday at the Coach House 
put rumors of his demise to rest. Despite the fact that King is one of the 
hardest-working acts in the business (one pop encyclopedia reports that he did 
342 one-night stands in 1956 and hasn't slowed down much since then), he came 
out fresh and exuberant, singing with the kind of strength and conviction that 
has kept him on top of the blues heap for almost three decades. 
</P>
<P>
His second number, "Look at Me (I'll Still Be Around)," seemed to acknowledge 
that longevity, and it was on this tune that King chose to take his longest 
guitar solo. Playing what at times sounded almost like a glorious fanfare, the 
guitarist balanced crisp, minimalist, mid-range phrases with some clipped 
chording and a tell-all, deep-throated low end that brought depth to the 
promise implied in the song's title. 
</P>
<P>
With only a few other exceptions, King's guitar -- which he calls Lucille -- 
was reduced to her familiar role of foil in call-and-response patterns, a 
character who jibes King for the foibles he sings about, one who sets the 
record straight when what he says just isn't so ("You know I love you, baby," 
croons King. "Uh-huh, sure," answers Lucille). The guitarist's familiar crying 
tones served as prelude to the strong, rough-hewn vocal lines the singer used 
to close out a vocal phrase. 
</P>
<P>
A crack seven-piece band directed by King's nephew Walter King delivered tight 
ensemble work or loose interplay as required, and the singer spent a good 
amount of time during the hourlong set introducing the members and coaxing the 
crowd to applaud their different performances. There was even time for a few 
high jinks, with a chair brought out for the portly gentleman and King telling 
the crowd, "I'll bet you thought you'd never live long enough to see B.B. King 
sit down." 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist combined a number of his well-known tunes, including "Nobody 
Loves Me but My Mama" and Roy Hawkins' "The Thrill Is Gone," into a long, 
mostly spoken tale of lovers' woe that reduced the songs to novelties. This 
emphasis on stagemanship rather than music detracted from the overall 
performance, but there was enough playing -- and singing -- of R &amp; B-framed 
blues to bring the crowd to its feet several times for long, clamorous 
ovations. King's encore, a recent ballad titled "Bring Peace to the World," may 
not have had much to do with the blues but was, considering the times, a 
fitting climax. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Russell, who played piano on King's popular 1970 album "Indianola 
Mississippi Seeds," opened solo for the blues singer. Looking not much 
different than he did in his "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" days, Russell worked in 
some new songs -- he's pulling together an album to be produced by Bruce 
Hornsby -- with the old standbys during a too-brief, half-hour set that he 
preluded with the refrain from "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Initially victimized by a bad mix that left his voice nearly inaudible for the 
first couple of tunes, Russell used a synthesizer to blend strings and other 
harmonic effects with his barrelhouse-professor keyboard style on tunes such as 
"A Song for You" and "Delta Lady." His gravelly voice, always less strong in 
the higher range, seemed especially pinched, and he fairly gurgled trying to 
hit high notes. But the character it carried, despite the bad sonics, commanded 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 B.B. King and Leon Russell play again tonight at 8 and 10:30 at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets are $25.

SOUTH COAST REP TAKES ON 'MAN AND SUPERMAN'; 
</P>
<P>
* THE PLAY, SHAW'S LONGEST AND MOST AMBITIOUS, IS RARELY STAGED WHOLE. BUT 
DIRECTOR MARTIN BENSON FINDS THE IDEA OF STAGING ONLY ONE PART "UNTHINKABLE."

<P>
Two decades after he wrote "Man and Superman," George Bernard Shaw looked back 
on what was his longest and certainly most ambitious play and concluded in one 
of his typically Olympian critiques that he had been only partially successful 
because his impulse to entertain had obscured the work's deeper intent. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the legend of Don Juan in its Mozartian form and made it a dramatic 
parable of Creative Evolution," Shaw wrote in 1921. "But being then at the 
height of my invention and comedic talent, I decorated it too brilliantly and 
lavishly. I surrounded it with a comedy of which (the parable) formed only one 
act, and that act was so completely episodical . . . that the comedy could be 
detached and played by itself." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with Shaw's own encouragement, that is what happened during the play's 
first outing, two years after he published the complete four-act version. "Man 
and Superman" was staged in 1905 without its third act, an epic dream that 
transfigures the principal characters of the Victorian comedy into a quartet of 
legendary immortals led by Don Juan and the Devil in philosophical arias on the 
meaning of love, death, civilization and, inevitably, Shaw's cherished Life 
Force. Since then, common theatrical practice has separated "Man and Superman" 
into two parts. Moreover, the "Don Juan in Hell" sequence is customarily 
mounted as a self-contained one-act drama of ideas (it lasts more than an hour 
on its own), the precedent for which was set in 1907, again, with Shaw's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
But for Martin Benson, who is directing "Man and Superman" at South Coast 
Repertory, the prospect of staging an admittedly stylish, deliciously witty but 
ultimately conventional drawing-room romance without its more serious 
intellectual core was unappealing and, he dares to say, "unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
That is why the SCR Mainstage production of "Man and Superman" -- now in 
preview performances for a season-opening premiere on Friday -- not only 
represents one of SCR's larger undertakings but also clocks in at 3 1/4 hours, 
even with judicious text trims and a single intermission. 
</P>
<P>
As Shaw biographer Michael Holroyd has noted, the great Irish playwright always 
wanted "Man and Superman" to be staged in its complete version. Shaw was 
nonetheless "of several minds" about its advisability -- not least while 
writing the play. It was "as long as three Meyerbeer operas," he claimed, "and 
no audience that had not already had a Shaw education could stand it." 
</P>
<P>
There was also the question of tone. The sudden elevation from a more or less 
frivolous cat-and-mouse battle of the sexes to the sublime plateau of a pulsing 
ideological debate had the effect of "grand opera (set) in the middle of a 
musical comedy," Shaw noted. Even he was not exempt from boggling at the 
full-length version. "I tried to see it myself once and nearly died of it," he 
is reported to have quipped. 
</P>
<P>
In these post-modern times, however, discontinuity of tone hardly seems an 
issue. Much late-20th-Century art thrives on it, in fact. And it would come as 
no surprise if Benson, who likes to refer to Shaw as one of our freshest 
writing talents, manages to trump the discontinuity of tone with a fin de 
siecle conceit that Shaw may never have dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
The production design alone is likely to do it. Cliff Faulkner's non-realistic 
set has everybody and every thing, including skeletal Victorian appointments, 
floating airily on a stage of painted clouds that sweep skyward in majestic 
bliss. Paulie Jenkins has lit the scenes with pastel pinks and blues, sometimes 
drenching the clouds with silvery hues that heaven itself might envy. 
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Yaji has gone the other way, toward comparatively conservative dress, 
outfitting the players in tastefully rich but purposely realistic Victorian 
costumes. The sound design by Michael Roth tweaks the ear with an assortment of 
musical snippets from Mozart to Roy Orbison and Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
SCR is no stranger to Shaw, of course. "Man and Superman" will be the ninth 
Shaw production since Benson and David Emmes founded the theater, a Tony 
Award-winner, 27 years ago. Although SCR may not be the house that Shaw built, 
its record of devotion to him makes it something of a Shavian Bayreuth. 
</P>
<P>
During SCR's third season, in 1966, Emmes staged "Candida." He did "Arms and 
the Man" the year after, and directed "You Never Can Tell" twice -- in 1989 and 
last June at the Singapore Festival of Arts on SCR's first international tour. 
Benson did "Major Barbara" twice -- in 1965 and 1983 -- and a prize-laden 
"Misalliance" in 1987. Guest director John Allison staged "Saint Joan" in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Benson had never seen a full-length "Man and Superman" until last 
season at Berkeley Repertory, when he was deciding whether to do this SCR 
production. In fact, he and SCR dramaturge John Glore used Berkeley Rep's 
edited version, by Amlin Gray, as a guide to their own script cuts. 
</P>
<P>
John de Lancie and Marnie Mosiman, who are husband and wife, star in the SCR 
production -- with each playing dual roles. De Lancie, who doubles as Don Juan, 
is the bachelor Jack Tanner, an outspoken freethinker and radical pamphleteer 
who fears marriage as one of the chief hypocrisies of society in general and 
his social class (the idle rich) in particular. Mosiman, who doubles as Dona 
Ana, plays the marriage-minded Ann Whitefield, a coquettish man hunter who has 
drawn a bead on Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
Filling out the cast are George Ede as Roebuck Ramsden and the Commander, 
Jarion Monroe as Mendoza and the Devil, John Walcutt as Octavius, Lynne Griffin 
as Violet, Patricia Fraser as Mrs. Whitefield, Don Sparks as Henry Straker, 
David Anthony Smith as Hector Malone and Richard Doyle as Mr. Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man and Superman" continues in preview performances through Thursday and 
opens Friday at South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. It 
runs Tuesdays through Sundays through Oct. 11. Tickets: $23 to $30; previews: 
$15 to $17. Information: (714) 957-4033.

Militants firing rockets, grenades and machine guns attacked security patrols 
in the Kashmiri summer capital of Srinagar. The state government in 
Indian-ruled Kashmir virtually collapsed as about 135,000 public employees 
began a weeklong strike to protest the alleged brutality of Indian security 
police. At least nine people were killed in clashes between protesters and the 
security forces in the Kashmir Valley, where Muslim militants are campaigning 
for independence or merger with Pakistan.

EUROPEANS HAVE MUCH TO LOSE IN THE GULF PUZZLE; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE, WHICH HAS PINNED ITS MIDEAST POLICY ON BAGHDAD FOR TWO DECADES, 
PROBABLY HAS THE MOST AT STAKE IN THE REGION.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the ground in Saudi Arabia and on the waters of the Persian Gulf, the United 
States carries the biggest stick in the showdown with the forces of Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
But in terms of economic and political risk, Western Europe probably has more 
at stake in the gulf conflict, particularly if it erupts into a fighting war. 
This is particularly true of France, which for 20 years has pinned its Middle 
East foreign policy on Iraq. It is least true of Britain, which is the only net 
exporter of oil in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, the European countries are far more dependent on the 
Persian Gulf for oil than is the United States, which receives only 7% of its 
total supply from the region. In contrast, the 17 European members of the 
International Energy Agency, the West's answer to the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, receive more than 24% of their total oil supplies from the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The geographic proximity of the volatile Middle East and Arab North Africa also 
produce anxieties in Europe that do not exist as strongly in the United States 
-- particularly, fears that a gulf conflict could spark another Arab-Israeli 
war and unleash a new generation of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Christoph Bertram, diplomatic correspondent for Die Zeit newspaper in Hamburg, 
commented: "People here have been drawing maps measuring the range of the new 
Israeli and Egyptian missiles. They are horrified to see that it takes in a 
sizable chunk of Europe. Although the gulf is far away, in our political 
subconscious it is the proximity of a potential Arab-Israeli conflict that 
worries us." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about security include fears that a gulf war would create a new wave 
of terrorism on the Continent, like those that swept through France, Italy and 
West Germany in the 1980s. Europeans are acutely aware that although terrorist 
activity is directed against American foreign policy, the most serious attacks 
usually occur outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If the war breaks out, the first risk is terrorism," warned Gilles Munier, a 
French pro-Arab militant active in the Iraq lobby in Europe. "There will be 
many repercussions. In any case, the bombs never explode in your country (the 
United States), they are always planted in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the European countries also have large Arab and Muslim minorities 
that react sensitively to events in Muslim lands. In both France and Britain, 
several leading Muslim clerics have condemned the presence of U.S. troops in 
Saudi Arabia. Talk programs on Europe's Arabic language radio stations are 
inundated with callers supporting Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
So far in the tense standoff that the French call the drole de guerre -- the 
"phony war" -- the United States and European allies have shown impressive 
solidarity in both military and political terms. Except for a few dissenters, 
notably French Minister of Defense Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Europeans and 
the Americans have spoken with one consistent voice. (Chevenement, a founding 
member of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Assn. in his country, embarrassed French 
President Francois Mitterrand by publicly opposing French participation in the 
naval blockade of Iraq.) 
</P>
<P>
More important, the Europeans have been willing to back up the talk with 
military hardware and personnel. Fourteen European warships are already in the 
gulf area, compared to 23 for the United States. Another 26 European vessels 
are on the way, representing military commitment from seven European countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing a very considerable buildup," said John Roper, director of 
the research institute for the Western Europe Union. "It may be that before 
long there will be as many European vessels in the gulf as there are American." 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics like British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher contend that most 
European countries have done only a minimum. "It is sad that at this critical 
time Europe has not fully measured up to expectations," she told a gathering of 
European conservative party leaders late last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect the United States to go on bearing major military and defense 
burdens worldwide, acting, in effect, as the world's policeman if it does not 
get a positive and swift response from its allies when the crunch comes -- 
particularly when fundamental principles as well as their direct interests are 
just as much at stake," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
And European analysts interviewed by The Times warn that the allied front could 
crack if Hussein continues to weather military and economic pressures from the 
international community. If the drole de guerre stretches into months and 
years, they said, the differences in American and European interests would be 
exacerbated, undermining the consensus on economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the main European interests that influence continental 
policies on the gulf:

Energy: 
</P>
<P>
Except for Britain and Norway, the only two net exporters of oil in the region, 
most European countries depend much more heavily on gulf oil than does the 
United States. The oil dependency is highest in Greece, which receives more 
than 65% of its domestic supply from the gulf. But France (36%), Belgium (34%), 
the Netherlands (31%), Spain (29%) and Italy (28%) are also highly dependent on 
gulf crude. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, as Die Zeit commentator Bertram noted, the source of oil in world 
markets is not as important as the price. Importers pay approximately the same 
price for oil whether it comes from the Yucatan or the Yukon, Siberia or the 
Sahara. Sudden fluctuations in supply such as those caused by the U.S.-led 
embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, raise the prices for everyone. (In addition, 
crude oil prices are fixed in dollars, currently at near-record lows on the 
international exchanges -- a plus for Europeans, but one that could change.) 
</P>
<P>
Regional disturbances in supply also greatly disrupt distribution systems in 
the importing countries. In France, for example, several of the refineries at 
the country's main oil port near Marseilles have already been forced to lay off 
workers because they dealt exclusively with Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, France and Italy, among other European countries, had entered into 
barter arrangements with the Iraqi government, drained of cash after its bloody 
eight-year war with Iran. This allowed Iraq to pay for manufactured goods, 
including sophisticated French weapons, with crude oil instead of currency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade: 
</P>
<P>
Although it has declined sharply in recent years because of Iraq's inability to 
pay its debts, European trade with Hussein's regime has been extensive. Last 
year, for example, West Germany sold $1.1 billion worth of machine goods, 
automobiles and pharmaceuticals to the Iraqis. Until it exploded into an 
international scandal, West German exports of chemicals helped Iraq build a 
stockpile of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French military-industrial complex sold Iraq most of the 
sophisticated weaponry that American, French and British troops face in the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute that monitors 
international arms transactions, France sold Iraq more than $5 billion worth of 
major weapons systems between 1980 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Commented Herbert Wulf, a senior researcher at the Stockholm Institute: 
</P>
<P>
"France provides the most prominent example of how this kind of weapons supply 
backfires and how shortsighted business interests (in earning) a quick franc 
eventually led to a situation where you get shot at with your own guns." 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by The European newspaper, the 12 member states of the 
European Community exported more than $4 billion in goods last year to Iraq, 
despite the country's shortage of cash and continuing controversy over its use 
of poison gas on the indigenous Kurdish population living on Iraq's border with 
Turkey and Iran. The same survey showed $1.5 billion in European Community 
exports to Kuwait in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Hussein regime still owes billions of dollars to the 
Europeans, including $4.6 billion to the French, $900 million to West Germany 
and $900 million to Italy. According to SACE, the Italian export credit 
insurance company, Italian businesses stand to lose as much as $11 billion in 
business deals with Iraq because of the economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the economic damage is not limited to business with Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has already affected spending by the other oil-rich kingdoms and 
emirates in the gulf region for products ranging from German luxury cars to 
racehorses. In fact, events in the gulf cast a pall over the annual sale of 
French yearlings held recently in Deauville, on the Normandy coast. Hordes of 
buyers from the gulf normally show up at the thoroughbred auction, the European 
version of the annual Kentucky yearling sale at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, reporters said only one Arab came to Deauville and he 
bought only one modestly priced horse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Geopolitics: 
</P>
<P>
On the geopolitical front, the big loser in the Persian Gulf crisis is France. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, since President Charles de Gaulle forged the 
French-Arab policy in the wake of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, Iraq's best 
friend in the West has been France. 
</P>
<P>
In much the same way that Iran was once the pillar of U.S. interests in the 
region, Iraq was the pivot for the French in the Arab world. "Americans learned 
their lesson about putting all their eggs in one basket with the Shah of Iran 
(Mohammed Reza Pahlavi),"commented Wulf of the Stockholm Institute. "The U.S. 
banked on the shah as the guarantor of stability in the region and watched as 
its Middle East policy was wiped out" when the shah was ousted from power in 
the Iranian revolution. "All of a sudden, France finds herself in the same 
boat." 
</P>
<P>
The warm Franco-Iraqi relations began under De Gaulle but intensified after the 
economically devastating 1973 oil shock. Terrorist actions in France by 
pro-Iranian agents made the French feel even closer to the Iraqis. French 
supplies of weapons and expertise during the Iran-Iraq War cemented the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
During the war, French writers, journalists and politicians donned battle 
fatigues and toured the front, sending back glowing tributes to the 
"progressive" Saddam Hussein regime. A spectrum of political leaders ranging 
from Chevenement to former Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac had only fond 
words for the Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi lobby in France was large and powerful. In addition to Chevenement, 
the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Assn. included prominent leaders in the defense 
industry. The impressive Iraqi cultural center in Paris was housed in a mansion 
owned by the Dassault family, owners of the aerospace company that sold Iraq 
more than 150 Mirage fighters. Stories circulated widely that the Iraqis had 
contributed lavishly to political parties, from the right to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Heisbourg, French director of the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies in London, noted that receptions at the Iraqi Embassy in 
Paris were among the most popular on the political social scene. "The Iraqis 
had a broad sweep of friends," Heisbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics suggested that this explained why France moved relatively slowly to 
respond to U.S. appeals for support in the gulf intervention. "Speedy 
Diplomats, Slow Boats," the Times of London commented caustically. Even after 
President Mitterrand ordered French ships, commandos and helicopters into the 
gulf, Chevenement made a statement attacking his own government's policy. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, France has become the second-largest military presence in the gulf 
behind the United States. The result is a terrible sense of betrayal on the 
part of the Iraqis -- who reportedly offered to release French citizens from 
Iraq and Kuwait if the French would stay neutral in the conflict -- and a 
French Middle Eastern foreign policy that is in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
"What we cannot understand," Iraq's Hussein said in a bizarre, rambling 
interview with a French journalist the other day, "is the position of France. 
The only country we blame is France. We don't directly blame the United States 
or Great Britain because they were never objective. They were never our 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Muslims: 
</P>
<P>
The mystery factor in the European response to the gulf crisis is the 
Continent's large Arab and Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
France has 3 million Muslims, mostly ethnic Arabs from the Maghreb countries 
(Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) of North Africa. Britain has 400,000 Arabs and 1.5 
million Muslims, most from Pakistan and India. West Germany has fewer Arabs but 
a huge Turkish population estimated at nearly 2 million. Turks are also Muslims 
who tend to react similarly on Middle East issues. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are an estimated 7 million Muslims living in Europe. Together, 
they form an increasingly volatile and sensitive element of European life that 
has no equivalent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the allied intervention in the Persian Gulf has so far been mixed, 
although leading Muslim clerics in Marseilles, France, and in London have 
condemned the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. According to reports in 
the French press, police have kept 30 suspected Iraqi agents under surveillance 
to prevent them from inciting Muslims against the military action in the gulf. 
Three small pro-Iraq demonstrations have been held in Paris since the Aug. 2 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, phone lines to Arabic radio stations in Europe, including Radio 
Maghreb in France, have been jammed with callers. 
</P>
<P>
"The first reaction of the callers after the attack was unanimous condemnation 
of Iraq," said Dahmane Abderrahmane, manager of Radio Maghreb. "But from the 
moment when the Americans became engaged militarily, there was a unanimous 
condemnation of America." 
</P>
<P>
A key factor is resentment of U.S. policy regarding Israel and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In general, as Bertram of Die Zeit commented, Europeans do not share the 
special relationship the United States has with Israel. "European countries," 
Bertram said, "tend to distance themselves more from Israel." 
</P>
<P>
The attitude is much stronger in the European and Muslim communities. European 
Muslims have no strong affection for Kuwaitis. "The Maghrebians are not going 
to weep for the rich Kuwaitis in the casinos on the Champs Elysees," said 
Abderrahmane. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are they particularly fond of Saddam Hussein. "There is not one of us who 
would lift his little finger for Saddam Hussein, and he knows it," said Arezki 
Dahmani, director of the predominantly Arab civil rights organization, France 
Plus. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Dahmani and other European Arab leaders, the European Muslim 
community feels it is hypocritical for the United States to condemn the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait without moving more strongly to reverse the 23-year Israeli 
occupation of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bush doesn't integrate the Palestinian question into the discussion," 
predicted Dahmani, "irrationality will have the day."

EVANGELISTS IN AN OLD PLAZA SELL HOPE FOUND IN LITERACY; 
</P>
<P>
IN MEXICO CITY, PUBLIC SCRIBES WRITE LETTERS FOR THE LOVELORN AND THE 
ILLITERATE. THEY ACT AS COUNSELORS AND LINGUISTIC GUIDES TO A WAITING PUBLIC.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their tools have evolved over the last 150 years, but their mission is the 
same. From the stone, arched portico of Santo Domingo Plaza, dozens of public 
scribes offer their writing services to the lovelorn and illiterate, to 
students, taxpayers and job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpened plumes and ink pots have been replaced by manual Remingtons and 
Olympias; a few electric typewriters have made their way into the colonial 
plaza. The scribes, however, still call themselves evangelists, the traditional 
term for purveyors of the written word. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of their work is routine -- filling out tax forms and job 
applications -- men and women also come to them with requests for love letters, 
university theses and appeals to Mexico's president. 
</P>
<P>
"We are guides and servants of the Mexican people," said Hipolito Ortiz, 50, 
who has been a scribe for half his life. "They come to us with sentimental 
problems and moral problems. Sometimes they cry. We still write love letters, 
although now they usually are to people who live far away. One writes these as 
if they were your own, not for a client but as if it were your own personal 
suffering." 
</P>
<P>
The job of a scribe is demanding, said the bespectacled Ortiz, who considers 
himself part psychologist and part priest. A scribe not only must master typing 
and spelling but must be able to turn a phrase and offer good counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"One acquires experience over the years and learns to give advice. For example, 
not all love letters are pure joy. Some are about deception, but they are still 
love letters. If a man wants to write something violent to his girlfriend, I 
try to calm him down. 'Violence is ephemeral, love is enduring,' I tell him," 
Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, he recalled, a couple came to him with their young daughter 
asking for a letter to a civil judge. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted a divorce. I said, 'What about your little girl? There must be a 
solution. I will write your letter, but in a week. Come back in a week.' They 
came back three days later and told me they had decided not to get a divorce. 
For me, that is a satisfaction that I will never forget," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, Ortiz said, an elderly and illiterate woman came to him with 
her 5-year-old grandson. They were survivors of the 1985 earthquake in which 
the boy's parents died. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to write a letter to the president's wife asking for help or a job. 
She laid out her problems, and I wrote the text. I wrote the prettiest letter 
imploring, very sincerely, for the senora's most valuable assistance, for 
economic or material help," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard what happened yet, but she'll come back and tell me. Tomorrow 
or the day after tomorrow, she'll come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ortiz, who is head of the public typists union, the first scribe 
to install himself in Santo Domingo plaza was Manuel Rivera Cambas in 1854. He 
wrote with a bird's feather that he kept razor sharp. Ortiz said Rivera Cambas 
wrote love letters, but some people say he also copied down prayers for 
worshipers at the baroque Santo Domingo church, built in 1736 on the northern 
edge of the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the church is the palace that housed the Inquisition, or the Tribunal 
del Santo Oficio. About 50 people reportedly were burned at the stake in Mexico 
during the Inquisition. The palace later became the government School of 
Medicine and then a museum. 
</P>
<P>
On the eastern rim of the plaza is the mansion of a Spanish conqueror, the 
Marquis de Villamayor, which became the government Customs House. Today, the 
mansion belongs to the Ministry of Education and is decorated with murals by 
Diego Rivera depicting the lives and hardships of common people. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain at the center of the plaza is overwhelmed by sunning pigeons, who 
are surrounded by vendors, shoppers and children. Men sell coffee from giant 
thermoses on their backs; women sell mangoes and other sliced fruits from their 
colored carts. Business-suited bureaucrats stop to read the newspaper or get a 
shoeshine. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the colonnade with the scribes are dozens of printers running their 
manual presses out of wooden kiosks. Letter by letter, the printers in 
ink-stained smocks set the type for wedding announcements, baptismal 
invitations, business cards and pads of receipts. The arcade echoes with the 
clatter of their iron press. 
</P>
<P>
Electric typewriters, offset presses and computers have taken away some of 
their clients, but still there is enough work to keep them in business, they 
say. What hurts more than anything are newcomers who don't take pride in their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the new printers are lazy and not so professional," said Carlos Lara, 
38. "They make their clients come back two or three times before the work is 
ready, and that hurts us all. Later, the clients say we're all alike." 
</P>
<P>
Lara, whose 16-year-old son works with him at the press, said the bustling 
plaza has been home to him since he was a teen-ager. "We live here. This is our 
source of work." 
</P>
<P>
Like Lara, 64-year-old scribe Jose Chavez has spent the better part of his life 
in the plaza. He arrived in Mexico City from Durango at age 24 with dreams of 
becoming a commercial artist. Chavez designs greeting cards for the printers 
and does calligraphy on diplomas, as well as writing missives. 
</P>
<P>
"I've liked to draw since I was a little boy," said the gray-haired scribe. 
"That's why this is a good job. That, and because I have no boss. I'm my own 
boss." 
</P>
<P>
The pay, said Chavez and others, is modest. They charge just over a dollar for 
a one-page letter or to fill out a government form. On a good day, they might 
make $17 or $18 -- especially around the 15th and 30th of each month, when 
taxes are due and workers get paid. But on many days, they don't make nearly 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he identifies with the young men from the provinces who come to him 
for letters to family back home. 
</P>
<P>
"They are unhappy with their jobs or bosses, they have problems with the 
government. There are too many people in Mexico City, and they complain about 
the crowds in the Metro or about how expensive everything is. They come to 
better their lot. If they do, they stay. If they can't, they go back home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasure of a scribe, Chavez said, is in helping people such as these -- 
poor people, people lost in the government bureaucracy, people in love. 
</P>
<P>
"We help them express themselves," Chavez said. "Many times, they know what 
they want to say and they need to say it very badly, but they don't know how. 
We try to make them understood."

ZAHONY, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On his hairy, suntanned chest, just above the St. Christopher medal, Polish 
trader Marian Konja displays his up-market wares: three gold chains and a lone 
earring that dangles a Cyrillic-lettered Soviet price tag. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves his hands free to show off both sides of a poor man's product: 
vanilla-scented auto air fresheners in the shape of oak leaves, with pictures 
of topless women glued to the back. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the swimming trunks and several days' growth of beard, it is hard to 
tell that Konja is on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other Poles, he is spending his monthlong holiday in Eastern 
Europe's isolated and blistering-hot border towns, engaged in private 
enterprise at its most primitive level. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages that abound in Romania and the Soviet Union have given rise to a form 
of commerce that under communism would be deplored as black marketing but in 
these more tolerant times is simply disdained for showcasing the flaws of the 
region's troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
Part-time traders like Konja come to border markets like Zahony to sell the 
cheap, state-subsidized goods they gather by scouring each Eastern European 
country for its best remaining bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Baby clothes from Czechoslovakia, portable chess sets from the Soviet Union, 
polyester sweaters from Poland, and lampshades from Budapest are collected 
during dizzying sweeps from the Baltic to the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
Neither currency nor language appears to be a problem in the multinational 
merchandising conducted at Zahony, where the Soviet Ukraine and Czechoslovakia 
meet Hungary across the grayish gurgle of the Tisza River. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bank," explains Zigmund Miller, clad in the barest of bathing trunks and 
rubber thongs. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sprawls in a lawn chair and quaffs a West German beer. Only the wad of 
Soviet rubles strapped to a calculator testifies to his temporary profession. 
Dollars and deutschemarks, in which he also deals, are hidden away in a plastic 
bag, pinned between his legs by the beer bottle. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the rate?" inquires a harried Soviet housewife, making her way to the 
remote parking lot that is known as the Polish Market. She has just spent five 
hours getting through Soviet customs, managing to smuggle out a few hundred 
rubles. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, Soviets can take out only 5 rubles -- enough for a cab ride home when 
they return from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"A hundred fifty (rubles) per 1,000 (forints)," Miller grunts, driving away the 
housewife in disgust and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is a shocking reminder of the relative worthlessness of 
non-convertible currencies. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet ruble at the official rate in Moscow costs $1.60. Even taking the 
Hungarian currency at its official value of 65 to the dollar, which is also 
somewhat inflated, the ruble commands only about 10 cents in buying power at 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
For people who can buy nothing at home, Zahony is, relatively speaking, a 
consumer paradise. Driven by desperation, they trade their smuggled rubles for 
what they can get. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to tell, at this embryonic level of capitalism, who is 
exploiting whom. 
</P>
<P>
Poles, suffering the effects of their government's "shock therapy" approach to 
free market economics, have seen a 40% drop in their real incomes, which were 
already seldom more than the equivalent of $300 per month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work during our vacation or we don't eat. It's that simple," 
explains Eva, a polygraph institute worker from Lodz traveling the market route 
with her husband and infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
With one eye on her sleeping baby, cocooned in a nearby yellow pup tent, Eva 
suns herself and barters in bad Russian with Soviet browsers over the price of 
videocassettes, tapes and calculator watches. 
</P>
<P>
At 300 forints each, or $4.62, the cassettes are a phenomenal bargain for 
Soviets, who must pay 30 rubles ($48) on the black market at home. 
</P>
<P>
But faced with chronic food shortages, Soviet shoppers are often forced to 
spend precious forints on the most basic of necessities. 
</P>
<P>
A Ukrainian housewife from Chop said she travels to Zahony to buy sugar and 
flour because even those commodities are often unavailable back home. She, her 
husband and a 30-year-old retarded son survive on 190 rubles per month -- 
enough to buy only about $20 worth of goods at Zahony. 
</P>
<P>
The market operates to serve the most disadvantaged of Eastern Europeans, and 
evidence of poverty and ignorance abound. 
</P>
<P>
A drunken Romanian lobs empty beer bottles at a puppy curled in the stingy 
shade of a sapling. 
</P>
<P>
A Polish woman and a Soviet Gypsy fall into a bilingual screaming match over 
the latter's claim to have been shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"You owe me 800 forints, you crook!" shouts the hysterical Gypsy, grabbing at 
cash clutched firmly by the Polish trader, who slaps her for trying. A crowd 
draws around to watch the women hiss and hurtle insults, frightening their 
children into terrified wails. 
</P>
<P>
Zahony is one of a dozen trading posts that have come to be known as "Comecon 
markets," referring to their clientele from the Soviet trade bloc. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin's "Polenmarkt" thrived long before the wall came down, funneling 
hand-knit sweaters, vodka and caviar to Berliners for a fraction of the usual 
cost and providing the Polish traders with hard currency to keep their families 
afloat back home. 
</P>
<P>
Comecon markets are also flourishing in Budapest, Warsaw and at distant border 
towns like Giurgiu, Romania and Bregovo, Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, Zahony is the target of an official crackdown. Like the 
others, it will likely survive the campaign to stem the flow of goods across 
porous borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union imposed new customs restrictions on Aug. 1, which cut the 
number of Soviets traveling out through Hungary by more than 25%. Soviets 
living near the Hungarian border now need special permission to cross, whereas 
traffic was virtually without hindrance for the preceding 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrative of the capitalist instinct that survives in even the oldest 
Communist state, Soviet officials are now selling border passes on the black 
market for 35 rubles ($56), according to a woman from Uzhgorod. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov instituted the tighter border controls 
to prevent what he said was the loss of Soviet consumer goods to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The Budapest daily Nepszabadsag noted early last month that the new 
restrictions affect only Soviets and Hungarians, and will will do nothing to 
prevent buyouts by the enterprising Poles. But it will cut down on the wait at 
the border, which can last as long as 10 days for those traveling by car. 
</P>
<P>
Romania imposed tariffs at the Giurgiu crossing in July, which slowed traffic 
for a few days before traders regrouped and rerouted duty-subjectable wares to 
other markets. 
</P>
<P>
While the traders seek to provide goods where the state has failed, they are 
generally despised by their customers. Part of the resentment is jealousy, as 
the traders earn substantially more than the average East Bloc citizen. Others 
realize that the locustlike buyouts perpetuate shortages the new democratic 
leaderships are struggling to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian authorities have imported toiletries, foreign foods and other scarce 
goods to placate the masses, only to see them scooped up by traders paying a 
slight premium to salesclerks, then selling them for higher prices at the 
border markets. 
</P>
<P>
Ferenc Dobos, a department head at Hungary's Ministry for Industry and Trade, 
said his office has proposed customs duties for those bringing larger 
quantities of consumer goods into the country than would be necessary for 
personal use. But he concedes enforcement would be spotty at best. 
</P>
<P>
Another approach recently suggested by both Hungarian and Romanian authorities 
is one that would warm the hearts of many a capitalist: legalize the markets 
and collect a moderate tax.

BATTLE-WEARY IRAQIS PREPARE FOR NEW ORDEAL

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The large black banners began appearing a few days ago at busy intersections 
throughout Baghdad, and, for most Iraqis, their message had an old yet 
painfully familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
They were official reminders of heroism, martyrdom and death. For a nation that 
has endured far too much of all three in the past decade, they were dark omens 
that yet another round of war may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of God, the most gracious, most merciful," began one such banner 
on the wall outside the Baghdad Horsemanship Club compound in the Al Mansour 
neighborhood, "this is to honor the martyrdom of air force pilot Maj. Mohammed 
Abdulaziz Tabara, who died on Aug. 4 as he fought for the Islamic nation." 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 4, 1990, two days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: a prelude to what may 
become another war. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Iraq's brutal eight-year conflict with Iran, which ended just two 
years ago, the white-on-black banners were constant sights on Baghdad's 
streets. But their reappearance this week in a nation so tightly controlled 
that official permission is required for every billboard and sign stands out as 
a stark symbol of how President Saddam Hussein is psychologically preparing his 
17 million people for more war, more death, more sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the black martyrdom banner, there was another one in white that 
declared, "Iraq is trying to protect the holy places from the Americans and 
those who cooperate with them." 
</P>
<P>
They are much-needed messages, to be sure. In a nation where nearly every 
family has lost sons or fathers and tens of thousands more lost limbs, the 
memories of the war recently ended are as painful as an open wound. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows how many died during those eight years of trench warfare, tank and 
artillery battles and missile barrages, although most estimates put the death 
toll as high as 1 million -- nearly half of them Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
To the Western mind, the mere thought of yet another, far more catastrophic 
conflict with the many foreign armies and sophisticated air forces that the 
outside world has ranged around them would plunge such a nation into utter 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi mind is a thing apart. It is battle-weary, yet battle-hardened. 
It deeply mourns human loss, yet uses that sorrow to fight harder. It is a mind 
as tightly controlled as the society around it, constantly bombarded with 
Hussein's slogans about Iraqi pride and nationalism. And it is a mind that he 
has conditioned to draw personal strength from the power of its president and 
its nation. 
</P>
<P>
Just listen to Madria Nasser Abdul Mishadani, a 40-year-old teacher whose 
husband was injured nearly a dozen times while fighting in the Iran-Iraq War 
but kept returning to the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
Approached at random by an American journalist in a Baghdad market on Monday, 
she was asked whether Iraqi women are nervous about the looming war. 
</P>
<P>
"No women are afraid," she said. "Aren't we Iraqis? Why should we be scared of 
war?" 
</P>
<P>
She added that the commitment is not merely a nationalist one. The cause is 
just, she said, and one worth fighting for, even if it means taking on the rest 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"For 20 years, we've tried to get Kuwait," she said with pride about the Aug. 2 
invasion that started the Persian Gulf crisis. She justified Iraq's occupation 
of the tiny gulf state by citing the U.S. invasion of Panama last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nabeel Abyass, who was standing in a bread line several miles away, echoed that 
view. In fact, the 30-year-old employee of a Baghdad export-import firm, who 
fought in the front lines of the Iran-Iraq War from 1984 until it ended in 
1988, described the Iraqi psyche by using the Arabic word that means "hardened 
in battle." 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I be afraid of war?" Abyass asked. "The people who are in the right 
aren't afraid of fighting those who are wrong. Besides, we have the will to 
face the strongest country in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The bravado clearly is part of the way every Iraqi home gets psyched up each 
day in the current crisis. It is a joint effort, Abyass said. When he goes home 
at the end of each day, the nights are filled with talk of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics and work are our entire lives right now." 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest cheerleader of all is the president himself. He has built into 
Iraq's Orwellian system a natural resilience and cult of the military that 
actually thrives in a war atmosphere, according to diplomats and analysts who 
have lived in Baghdad during times of both war and peace. 
</P>
<P>
The prolonged war with Iran also gave Hussein distinct logistic advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, because of the war, the Iraqis have an enormous ability to organize 
things," one European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
And the fresh backdrop of war appears to have conditioned Iraqis to the concept 
of personal and physical sacrifice for the preservation of a nation long ruled 
by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
These are all traits that Hussein has taken pains to nurture and reinforce in 
his society, both to strengthen the nation amid the devastation of war and to 
justify the fight, no matter how obtuse the logic. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, for example, is filled with government-commissioned statues and 
mammoth posters attesting to glorious victory in the war with Iran, in which 
Iraq gained little and then, just two weeks ago, gave up every piece of real 
estate it had captured. 
</P>
<P>
Outside one government building is a statue of a giant Iraqi air force pilot 
standing amid the actual ruins of a crashed Iranian F-4 fighter jet. 
Officially, it is to commemorate an air force so proficient that it is said to 
have shot down 67 Iranian planes in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
A guide from the Iraqi Cultural Ministry explained that the story behind the 
statue is of a dogfight between an Iraqi pilot, who was out of ammunition, and 
an Iranian jet close on his tail. The Iraqi is said to have looped around and 
deliberately crashed into the Iranian in a suicide maneuver that killed both. 
</P>
<P>
But the best illustration of the unusual war psychosis that Hussein has bred 
into his people is the enormous Monument of Saddam's Qadissiya Martyrs. It 
commemorates the war dead from the Iran-Iraq War, which the Iraqi president 
named Qadissiya II after a 7th Century battle in which Arabs defeated Persians. 
</P>
<P>
The shrine sits in the center of a 600,000-square-yard park that includes a 
roller coaster and other amusement park rides. The monument, a glittering blue 
Islamic dome split into two pieces, stands 120 feet high and 440 feet wide. It 
weighs 2,130 tons, all pure marble covered in blue ceramic tile. It took 27 
months to build between 1981 and 1983, which was the height of the war. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the monument: 40 million dinars, then the equivalent of nearly $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fascinating reflection of Saddam Hussein's priorities," one Western 
diplomat in Baghdad said. "While most of the Arab leaders in the gulf have 
spent their vast oil wealth on opulent palaces, Gargantuan and abstract 
sculpture and municipal buildings or simply gambling in the casinos of London 
and Monte Carlo, Saddam has used it for things like this. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, of course, he has had to. He needs these huge symbols to convince 
his people of what he himself believes to be true. And he needs them to 
reinforce the notion that they must always be ready for war, that the sacrifice 
of war brings both glory and strength." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Baghdad's bazaars, it would seem that Hussein's policy of 
indoctrination has been all but complete. 
</P>
<P>
Hicham Abdul Alim, a 30-year-old pharmacist waiting along with 29 others in one 
of the many bread lines caused by the world's embargo of trade with Iraq, was 
asked whether some of his friends and neighbors were hoarding food to prepare 
for war, an offense punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
Alim, who is not a member of Hussein's Arab Baath Socialist Party, said that he 
did know of several such offenders but that each time he learned of it, he 
would give them a simple speech he said was designed to prepare them for 
another round of sacrifice and war. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a weak person," he said in relating that speech to an American 
journalist Monday. "A strong person can feed himself on one loaf of bread, 
while a weak person can have 50 loaves of bread and still feel he doesn't have 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Ahmad Abdallah, 54, who was standing nearby, was asked whether he had 
anything he wanted to say to the American government, which is leading the 
boycott that has forced him to wait each day for flour and bread. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell the American people that our president wants peace," he said. 
"I'm sure the American people want peace, but Bush wants to keep causing 
problems. . . . This is a fight between presidents." 
</P>
<P>
But then, Abdallah added that he and his countrymen are more than prepared for 
an all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
"We have experienced war for the last decade," he said. "And we are ready to 
fight until the last person."

50,000 LOSING HOPE AT DESERT REFUGEE CAMPS

RUWEISHED, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 50,000 Asian refugees from Kuwait are trapped in desperation on a 
scorched patch of desert near the Iraqi border here, short of food, water and 
hope. Awaiting elusive repatriation, their companions are fear, boredom, 
asphyxiating red tape and the specter of epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shade. By day, thirsty refugees from a half dozen countries bake 
under a merciless sun and 100-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
There are few tents. By night, white- and blue-collar Asians who staffed 
Kuwait's luxury hotels and ran its shops and offices sleep in the rough on the 
cold and rocky desert floor. The scorpions are relentless. 
</P>
<P>
"For God sake's, man, get word to the Indians still in Kuwait. Tell them to 
stay where they are; it's 100 times worse here," begged John Seraoo, a merchant 
from Kuwait city. Red-eyed and unshaven, he joined an angry and articulate mob 
of Indian and Bangladeshi refugees jammed around a handful of reporters who 
reached the Shaalon 2 refugee camp near the Iraqi border Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On what, just two weeks ago, was desolation marked only by a radio tower 26 
miles east of the border checkpoint of Ruweished, about 42,000 souls were 
confined Monday in pain and boredom at Shaalon 2. 
</P>
<P>
By Jordanian government count, another 16,000 refugees were at the Shaalon 1 
camp 4 1/2 miles from Ruweished on the road to Baghdad. In all, the government 
said Monday night, there are 105,000 refugees in Jordan waiting to return to 
Third World countries that they had left to earn petrodollars. 
</P>
<P>
By every indication, there are more hundreds of thousands of Asians still to 
come, fleeing from the expatriate communities in Kuwait and Iraq that totaled 2 
million people before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
With thousands of new arrivals in Jordan on Monday came reports of tens of 
thousands of refugees waiting to cross Iraq's borders with Iran and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, Pakistanis described to the Associated Press similar desperate 
conditions at a refugee camp on the Iraqi side of the frontier. They said at 
least three Pakistanis, including a woman giving birth, have died at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Iran offered to receive 100,000 mostly Asian refugees across its border with 
Iraq but said people of any nationality, including Americans and Britons, would 
also be welcomed, the AP reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Amman government, overwhelmed by 307,549 refugees in the first month of 
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, is pleading for international help to confront what 
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother, calls "a human 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Much -- around $150 million worth -- is promised by individual countries and 
international relief agencies. Too little has so far arrived to make any impact 
on the suffering in the desert, and relief officials begged the international 
community to provide more. 
</P>
<P>
With shelter and supplies short, sanitary facilities almost non-existent and 
tempers raw among rival ethnic groups, the overnight desert camps are disasters 
waiting to happen, relief workers warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is now very critical," said Khaled abu Halimeh, the Jordanian 
doctor who heads a 20-member Red Crescent volunteer medical team at Shaalon 2. 
"We have dehydration and diarrhea, but it is not yet an epidemic. There are 
many scorpion bites; they are difficult to treat. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sharing our food and water, but there is not enough; there are so many 
pregnant women and children. They should be getting 20 liters (of water) a day 
per person -- there is nothing like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government is accepting the refugees with the understanding that, 
except for Palestinians, they cannot stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems enough of our own. We simply cannot cope with all those 
people," said a senior Jordanian official. New arrivals are being processed as 
quickly as their predecessors leave. On Sunday, around 7,000 left, but almost 
twice that number arrived. With facilities in Amman jammed, the new arrivals 
are parked in the desert at the Shaalon camps, forbidden to leave. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-morning Monday in Shaalon 2, a Sri Lankan refugee identified by his 
friends as R. A. Sirisena died of a stomach disorder after a night of agony. 
Ten other Sri Lankans are badly ill, said S. D. Preniatalike, a self-appointed 
spokesman for them. 
</P>
<P>
Wind devils flirted with makeshift shelters where refugees crouched in the lee 
of sand-stained suitcases. In the suffocating medical tent, an Egyptian woman 
raised the morale of doctors who had not slept for too long by delivering a 
healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the sun, listless sentinels sprawled in the dust with empty bottles 
around an empty water tank whose side bore the inscription "Water for 
Filipinos." 
</P>
<P>
"When the water truck comes, what little it leaves is gone almost in the same 
moment," said one weary Filipina. 
</P>
<P>
A wheezing bus delivering apprehensive new residents turned past the Jordanian 
police jeep with a mounted machine gun that is signpost for the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Since last week, Jordan has restricted entries to 20,000 per day, but more 
people still arrive every day than a fledgling airlift is able to carry away. 
Jordan's refugee population is rising as inexorably as the desert sun -- and 
with it, human misery as an indicator of trauma in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to lose a business, but it is not until you have to slept on 
the desert floor for five nights with five young children, not even a tent, 
that you realize you have lost everything," said Abdul Rehman, 32, an Indian 
who had lived 15 years in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Near noon at Shaalon 2 on Monday, a packed line of refugees a quarter of a mile 
long stretched out from a tractor-trailer where Jordanian relief workers 
distributed the day's rations: thin rounds of pita bread and three overripe 
tomatoes per person. 
</P>
<P>
"They feed us like dogs," said Indian refugee George Rajan, denouncing 
administrative chaos at the camp. "We have money but we cannot buy. We have 
cars but we cannot drive. Some of us have airplane tickets but we cannot fly. 
Where is the Indian government?" 
</P>
<P>
"We are not white, we are not Arabs and we are not rich. So we are ignored. 
Should we expect anything different?" demanded a Sikh who said he has a cousin 
in New York and a looted electronic shop in Kuwait city he reckons is gone for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
In the melee, Saifee Surti, a 27-year-old currency trader, cast about for 
someone with permission to leave the camp who would call his family in India to 
help arrange passage. A Jordanian soldier ran off engineers Mohammed Rana and 
Ali Farouki as they explained how they had buried their British passports and 
disguised themselves as Pakistanis to avoid "being held hostage at some 
chemical plant or another." 
</P>
<P>
Among the nations with the largest expatriate populations in Kuwait and Iraq, 
it is Egypt, the largest, that has moved most firmly to aid its distressed 
citizens. So far, about 150,000 refugees have gone home on an air and sea lift 
based at the Jordanian port of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
India for its part is flying nearly 1,000 a day home, and the Philippines has 
repatriated about one-third of an estimated 9,000 of its citizens who have fled 
to Jordan so far. 
</P>
<P>
The International Organization for Repatriation, working with the U.N. Disaster 
Relief Organization and relying mainly on funds from the European Community, 
sent about 200 Sri Lankans home aboard a chartered Royal Jordanian Airlines 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt-poor Bangladesh, by contrast, has moved only about 1,000 of about 30,000 
refugees in the past month and says it is unable to care for the rest without 
international help. Residents say nearly half of the refugees at Shaalon 2 are 
Bangladeshis. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been here more than a week and nobody from our embassy in Amman has even 
bothered to come to see us," charged one young mechanic in a clutch of 
gesticulating and incensed Bangladeshis. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the International Organization for Repatriation has funds to 
repatriate about 9,000 Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis on eight Royal Jordanian 
flights and 10 trips by a cargo plane provided by the Soviet Union. But, he 
said, the group required $50 million more in donations to keep the air bridge 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
Relief supplies, including tents, blankets, food and money, arrive in Jordan 
daily now, but even if -- impossibly -- the influx were to stop tomorrow, it 
would take months to repatriate refugees already here. 
</P>
<P>
And that, it was stunningly clear to everyone at Shaalon 2 on Monday, would be 
tragically too long for the thousands adrift and imperiled in the cruel desert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ASIANS IN KUWAIT AND IRAQ 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Asian workers were stranded Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded 
Kuwait. Here are estimates of selected Asian nationals; precise figures and how 
many have left are unknown.

TABLOIDS: A WRITER WHO SAYS HE IS DOING AN EXPOSE ON THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH STEALING STORY IDEAS.

He was brash, controversial. As a writer he liked to incite anger -- to "twist 
the knife," as he put it, in vitriolic free-lance columns for the National 
Review attacking feminists, gays and other targets. And increasingly, Stuart 
Goldman gravitated to investigative journalism; he went undercover to research 
widely seen exposes of a TV evangelist and, later, an alleged UFO cult. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Goldman, with typical zeal, undertook what he claimed was a 
long-range, undercover expose of the gossip media -- the tabloid newspapers and 
TV shows that feed with shark-like frenzy on Los Angeles' vast entertainment 
community. It was a project, Goldman said, that drew him into the seamy 
underside of journalism, a world tainted with greed, spying and payoffs to 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
For months, he claims, he gathered material while free-lancing for the 
Enquirer, Fox Television's "A Current Affair," the Globe, the Star, Paramount's 
"Hard Copy" and other organizations. Ultimately, however, Goldman got burned. 
On March 8, the 45-year-old writer was arrested at his Studio City apartment by 
Secret Service agents and Los Angeles police who confiscated a personal 
computer, floppy disks, Rolodexes and a loaded .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman now faces seven felony charges for allegedly entering Fox Television 
computers by telephone and stealing story ideas. One of those ideas, according 
to court records, was a fictitious tip involving "Ronald Reagan Jr.'s Lover," 
planted by investigators as bait. Prosecutors say Goldman tried to sell the 
bogus tip to the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
The case not only raises computer-age issues of privacy, idea ownership and 
journalistic ethics; it is a saga befitting the tabloids, a battle of the 
influential network versus the self-proclaimed muckraker. 
</P>
<P>
Free from jail and awaiting an Oct. 1 preliminary hearing, Goldman denies the 
charge of trying to sell stolen information. His attorney, Joseph Yanny, claims 
Goldman was given authority to use the Fox computer while working as a 
free-lancer -- authority that was never revoked. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show that this was one very elaborate setup intended to get 
Stuart Goldman," Yanny said. "It was decided to get Stuart Goldman and to make 
an example of him -- not only to him from doing what he was trying to do with 
respect to the (expose), but also to make an example of him to other reporters 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Fox denies staging a setup. 
</P>
<P>
Says Goldman: "These people will look very foolish when they get into court. 
I'm the good guy and I'm going to prove it. This is going to be the biggest 
soap opera you ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
On the latter point, he may be right. In the wake of the arrest, rumors are 
flying -- about telephones being wiretapped, documents disappearing. Goldman 
has hired a private investigator; so has the National Enquirer, one alleged 
target of the expose. CBS's "60 Minutes" has hauled in its cameras, filming a 
possible expose of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two associate producers at "A Current Affair" who were closely 
involved with Goldman -- one of them a key prosecution witness -- were laid off 
last month by Fox. Network representatives called the move a restructuring; one 
insider expressed belief that the layoffs were prompted by the furor over the 
Goldman case. 
</P>
<P>
The drama, as bizarre as a purported Elvis sighting, is casting light on a 
journalistic world that few ever see. The ubiquitous tabloid medium probes 
zealously into the private lives of celebrities, painting an impressionistic 
portrait for millions. The Enquirer alone boasts a circulation of 4.3 million 
copies a week. Yet the tabloids so carefully guard their own secrets that the 
Enquirer and other organizations will not disclose how many reporters they 
assign to Los Angeles, never mind how they work or what they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman -- a dogged journalist with his own "rather jaded history," as he once 
told a TV talk show host -- sees irony in his arrest. After so many months in 
which he fit in so well, so convincingly, in the tabloid world, he was led away 
in handcuffs with Fox cameras filming it all. 
</P>
<P>
His face, flashing a mysterious half-smile, was prominently featured on the 
evening news. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you notice the two cops (who made the arrest) . . . wearing bulletproof 
vests?" Goldman asked indignantly, alluding to the newscast footage. "I said, 
'Did you guys really think I was that dangerous?' They said, 'Well, you never 
know what's on the other side of the door.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then, how come they let the cameraman stand in the line of fire? When I 
looked out my peephole, I saw a camera staring at me. If I had been nuts and 
had a shotgun, I would have wasted that guy!" 
</P>
<P>
Goldman had been producing a free-lance TV segment for "Inside Edition," a 
rival of Fox's "A Current Affair," at the time of his arrest. Now, with that 
segment in limbo, he is attempting to pitch his unfinished book manuscript, 
"Snitch." The work has made him the bad boy of the tabloid press, a cynical 
former insider whose kiss-and-tell report is expected to create enormous 
embarrassment for those who once dared to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a personal vendetta by members of the L.A. staff of 'A Current 
Affair,' " Goldman said. "Once I had started pitching the expose . . . the word 
was out. They learned of this and decided they would pop me before I popped 
them. And they whacked me pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
In a chapter of "Snitch" given to The Times but heavily expurgated by his 
lawyers, Goldman breezily recounts his early days at both "A Current Affair" 
and the Enquirer, describing with awe the Enquirer's "gigantic network of 
informants." 
</P>
<P>
Those informants -- paid hundreds, even many thousands of dollars for inside 
information about celebrities -- were a major element of his research, 
according to Goldman. One such source, a man who draws blood for a living at a 
prominent Los Angeles hospital, leaks information to the tabloids for profit 
any time a celebrity checks in for surgery or to have a baby, Goldman wrote. 
The man's code name is "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
"Friends, PR people, executives, bodyguards, waiters, parking lot attendants . 
. . all of them provided information to the Enquirer," Goldman writes. "All the 
tabloids functioned by making use of snitches. 
</P>
<P>
"If (a reporter) gets a tip . . . within about two minutes (the tabloids) will 
know somebody in some office somewhere and they'll start to get the story. It's 
really incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Enquirer attorney Paul Wolff, who called Goldman's disclosures about paid 
sources "old news," declined to discuss the research involved in the paper's 
stories. "We have in the past fought tooth and nail to keep our sources 
confidential," Wolff said. "We're not about to comment on them now." 
</P>
<P>
The war between celebrities and the tabloid press goes back years. Lately, 
however, with the advent of the so-called tabloid TV shows, the fight has 
escalated. Competition for stories has grown. One tabloid veteran, who asked 
for anonymity, said reporters are continually evaluated on the number of 
"leads," or possible stories, they find. Critics contend that payoffs to 
sources induces unscrupulous informants to lie. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra and Richard Pryor are among the 
increasingly outraged celebrities who have filed suit -- and won out-of-court 
settlements -- because of stories appearing in the tabloids. A besieged feeling 
exists among many top stars. Security consultant Gavin de Becker, whose clients 
include Madonna and Michael J. Fox, said some celebrities keep their trash cans 
behind locked gates because reporters comb the debris for tips. 
</P>
<P>
"They get (medical) prescriptions, early pregnancy tests, letters, etc." from 
the trash, De Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, Goldman described reporting practices he observed as part 
of his investigation -- practices he considered unethical, at best. Tabloids 
hire private detectives, for example, to run illegitimate credit checks or to 
obtain unlisted phone numbers, he said. A reporter will telephone, say, the 
mother of a young boy who has died -- and pretend to be the priest. 
</P>
<P>
"And he'll get the whole story out of the woman and have her cry, you know . . 
. and typically the most ruthless reporter will get the story," Goldman said. 
One especially effective tabloid reporter weighed nearly 400 pounds and 
"literally couldn't get out of bed," he added. "But she could imitate anybody 
on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff called such allegations "flat-out false" and said of Goldman: "I'm 
familiar with the fact he has told people he was somehow engaged in an 
undercover project. We'll see how it plays out in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
In the theory of some critics, Goldman has fabricated the "Snitch" project 
since his arrest to try to salvage his reputation and strike back at Fox. 
Free-lance writer Rod Lurie, who spent five months researching his own story on 
the tabloids, due out later this monthin Los Angeles Magazine, considered the 
question at length. He concluded that Goldman was, in fact, preparing an 
expose. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have a history of gonzo journalism," Lurie observed. "And another 
thing: He really was at all the tabloids. Nobody could be fired from that many 
places." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Goldman's past invites doubt. The former country-music guitarist, who once 
toured with Doug Kershaw, is an enigma, a do-anything, say-anything character 
seemingly drawn to controversy in the way old prizefighters are drawn back to 
the ring. Capable of great charm, Goldman can also be abrasive, unpredictable. 
Once, in 1988, he shocked his friends by distributing a fake suicide note, 
claiming an incurable disease and despair over a planet "ruined . . . by 
greedheads, liberals, feminists, homosexuals and other assorted swine. . . . 
"Please believe me, this is not a joke," the letter read. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, a fabricated obituary of Goldman appeared in the Los Angeles Daily 
News. 
</P>
<P>
The prank cost him friends -- "It wasn't very smart," Goldman acknowledged -- 
but it symbolized a restive nature given to subterfuge, deception and the 
habitual use of aliases. Goldman describes himself as a "frustrated private 
detective." He saw the tabloids as just one more subject to investigate, one 
that would lend itself to the undercover approach he favored while paying him 
in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Network officials accuse Goldman of stepping over the criminal line in whatever 
he was doing. Unauthorized entries into Fox's computer in Hollywood came to the 
network's attention more than seven months after Goldman last worked for "A 
Current Affair," the show's attorneys noted. A sting operation began in early 
February and lasted four weeks, said Sgt. Dick Richardson of the LAPD computer 
crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
Computer activity was carefully monitored and telephone traces were made. The 
targeted calls, made with another employee's pass code, were observed 
irregularly, sometimes twice or more in a day, sometimes not at all. Many 
lasted only a minute; a few stretched for as long as an hour. Eventually, 
investigators say, the calls were traced to Goldman's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fox officials planted two fictitious tips in the computer. One false 
lead, about New York real estate magnate Harry Helmsley, cited a "reliable" 
source who knew that Helmsley was leaving $50 million in a new will to a 
"houseboy" with whom he had possible "romantic" ties. The second bogus tip -- 
provided to The Times by Goldman -- purportedly involved "Ronald Reagan Jr.'s 
lover": 
</P>
<P>
"Contact says there are pictures and love letters, possible home videotape of 
two at Greenwitch (sic) Village Party 7/84. Do not contact Mr. Kim any more. . 
. . He says he will not deal with us. . . . However, other contact 'Tyrone' 
still seems agreeable but has to be approached very carefully. . . . He may 
want big bucks . . . but if info proves correct it will be well worth it. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Goldman copied the tip to his own computer and 
tried to sell the story to the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman denies the allegation, calling it "absolutely untrue. I never attempted 
to sell a story anywhere. They have no proof of that." 
</P>
<P>
Had Fox really wanted to keep information private, Goldman argued, the network 
would have "locked it up" electronically so that reporters and free-lancers 
could not see it at will. "There's nothing in those files . . . that would 
qualify as sensitive or valuable material," he asserted. "They get (the 
information) by clipping the newspaper or by any and every method of subterfuge 
. . . (and they say) . . . 'It's ours, we developed it.' Bull. It's not 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
The privacy issues are complicated by the fact that free-lance writers are 
often temporary employees whose access rights to information may change. In 
Goldman's case, he had quit working for Fox under acrimonious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Noted media scholar Ben H. Bagdikian, author of several books on journalistic 
ethics and professor emeritus of journalism at UC Berkeley, said the electronic 
convenience of a computer is generally no excuse for prying or stealing ideas. 
Computer data banks are not the equivalent of a newspaper that is available to 
anyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to take something that is in public domain," Bagdikian said, 
"and another thing to take something out of a private file. Whether 
(information is) locked up or in somebody's file or lying around on somebody's 
desk, it is dirty pool for most ethical writers" to take it. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who spent only three stormy months working at "A Current Affair," 
began the stint, ironically, on the strength of previous undercover projects. 
He had gained a reputation in Los Angeles -- at least two talk show hosts 
called him a "cult buster" -- after the L.A. Weekly ran his expose of TV 
evangelist Terry Cole-Whittaker. He had just completed undercover research on 
author Whitley Strieber, whose best-selling book, "Communion," describes 
Strieber's purported capture by aliens in UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
The UFO story, rejected by Penthouse magazine, became Goldman's entre into 
tabloids. "A Current Affair" was interested in a segment on Strieber's legion 
of followers -- all self-proclaimed UFO abductees. Goldman was invited to 
produce it and given space at the show's offices in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A former tabloid newspaper reporter named Riva Dryan shared her computer 
password, according to Goldman. In his version of events, he told Dryan about 
"Snitch." For a time, he said, she agreed to be a partner in exposing the 
tabloids -- until they quarreled over her unwillingness to devote time to it. 
At that point, Goldman said, he dropped her. 
</P>
<P>
Dryan, a key witness against Goldman, was laid off last month by Fox and could 
not be reached for comment. But producer Audrey Lavin, who called herself a 
close friend of Dryan, strongly disputed Goldman's account, saying Dryan knew 
nothing of an expose. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stress enough that Riva was a completely innocent party," Lavin said. 
"She loved her job as a tabloid reporter." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's battles did not stop there. He complained bitterly over the editing 
of his UFO segment, which Fox never aired. Then he left Fox to join Paramount's 
rival show, "Hard Copy," where he was interviewed on camera for that program's 
own UFO segment. The action, he said, enraged Fox officials -- who, in effect, 
were scooped on the story -- and touched off a separate soap opera involving 
Strieber. 
</P>
<P>
In the filmed interview -- and again in a debate with Strieber on CBS's "Good 
Morning America" -- Goldman likened the author to cult leader Jim Jones, 
instigator of the mass suicides in Jonestown, Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Jones killed -- he killed!" Strieber protested on national television; off 
camera, he filed a defamation suit. A chase then began between Strieber's 
process servers and Goldman. Goldman dodged them for weeks. When at last he was 
cornered, by a crafty Venice private detective with his own penchant for 
multiple identities, Goldman invited the man in for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'This guy's good,' " Goldman recalled. " 'I want him on my team.' " 
</P>
<P>
In one of the strange twists to the saga, Strieber this summer abruptly -- and 
without explanation -- dropped the defamation suit against Goldman. The 
detective, Tony Kost, now works for Goldman probing the circumstances of 
Goldman's arrest. According to Kost, the LAPD had no interest in the case until 
the phony tip was planted about Reagan's son, attracting the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's attorney in New York said she would not dignify Goldman's various 
assertions with comment. 
</P>
<P>
Facing up to six years in prison, Goldman frets incessantly over the possible 
outcomes. Yet he is also stubbornly defiant, pressing on to bring the sleazy 
nature of tabloid journalism before the world. On the cover of his manuscript, 
Goldman quotes "Proverbs": "The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a 
vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death."

YELTSIN OFFERS CRASH PLAN TO REVIVE SOVIET ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Soviet Union's vast Russian Federation, on 
Monday unveiled a crash 500-day program aimed at reviving the country's 
collapsing economy by selling off most state property, freeing prices to 
respond to supply and demand and sharply cutting spending on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the republic's legislature, newly convened for its autumn session, 
that its work on economic reform would mark the beginning of "a new political 
course -- this is the course to Russia's revival." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose Russian republic spans two-thirds of the Soviet Union's 
territory, presented the 500-day plan as the country's best hope of salvaging 
its crumbling economy, and he has warned that he will not wait for the central 
government if it tries to delay reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia gives the impulse for change to the entire country," Yeltsin told 
lawmakers. "The center can no longer ignore this and discard everything done by 
us." 
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the plan will be put to the legislatures of the other 14 Soviet 
republics withthe goal of beginning its implementation on Oct. 1, the start of 
the Soviet fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Newly disclosed elements of the program's first 100 days, if adopted 
nationwide, would include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An immediate 10% cut in the defense budget and 20% cut in funds for the 
KGB, the Soviet intelligence and security agency. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 75% cut in foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The quick selloff of government cars and various other property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sale on the world financial market, probably for a fraction of their 
nominal value, of the debts that other countries owe to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In opening this push to get the program approved by the Russian legislature, 
Yeltsin jumped ahead in his competition with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for 
leadership of the nation as it reshapes its economic system. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-day plan distributed to Russian deputies on Monday would allow private 
ownership of land and businesses, which now are virtually all state-owned, and 
begin the selloff of apartments, plots of land and enterprises by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a key move, it would gradually remove state control of prices to allow the 
market forces of supply and demand to work and entrepreneurship to replace 
government management of most of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin program incorporates many of the most radical proposals put forward 
over the last two years of debate on economic reform and ties them to a strict 
timetable that will give people confidence that the harsh measures at the 
outset would bring a better life within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The program, in a major shift of power, would also force a devolution of 
decision-making from the central government to the governments of the country's 
constituent republics and local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he wants the Russian legislature to vote on the plan on Sept. 11 
-- the same day Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov will present 
their reform proposals to the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told reporters last week that the more conservative plan prepared by 
Ryzhkov's government has good points and should be integrated with the 500-day 
model. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin replied Saturday that that would be impossible -- the plans are too 
different, he said -- and he called for Ryzhkov and his Cabinet to resign 
because the public had lost faith in them. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev, explaining the 500-day plan to the republic's 
legislature Monday, acknowledged that the Ryzhkov government had made sharp 
changes in its thinking, including the ideological acceptance of private 
property, once anathema to orthodox Communists. 
</P>
<P>
But it retains a top-to-bottom approach instead of allowing maximum freedom for 
local bodies, Silayev said, and still relies on the old-style bureaucracy to 
promote reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to you to survey this set of programs attentively and discuss 
it as fast as possible," Silayev said, calling for quick approval of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Although the major points of the Yeltsin plan had been under discussion since 
his advisers first outlined it in June, the plan underwent major changes last 
month as it was fine-tuned in a commission jointly sponsored by Gorbachev and 
Yeltsin to outline urgent reforms, according to the independent Soviet news 
agency Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
Silayev said the radical economists working on the plan were hindered by the 
outright refusal of several key government agencies that were asked to provide 
information, including the Defense Ministry, Foreign Trade Bank and State 
Planning Commission. Even direct instructions from Gorbachev failed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev created a set of new task forces Monday to deal with the burning 
economic problems that cannot wait until the compromise plan he wants is worked 
out. The three commissions, created at a meeting of the Presidential Council, 
the top policy-making body, will tackle the shortages of virtually all consumer 
goods from cigarettes to bread, the growing gaps between suppliers and their 
customers and the increasingly stormy relations between Moscow and local 
authorities.

SAUSALITO SAYS CENSUS TAKERS MISSED THE BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD MAASS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAUSALITO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sausalito Mayor Annette Rose heard that preliminary census figures showed 
that her popular bay-side town had lost population over the last decade, she 
figured the count was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Squinting across choppy waters toward San Francisco last week, she offered her 
first piece of evidence: The Census Bureau never mailed a form to the houseboat 
where she lives with her husband and two children. Rose and city officials 
figure there are about 1,500 others in the same boat. They blame what they see 
as a low population estimate on the exclusion of a significant group of 
residents -- people who live on boats. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal government released census figures last week, the tentative 
tally for Sausalito showed a 7% drop, from 7,338 to 6,857, while the overall 
ranks of Californians swelled by 24%. With more than hurt pride to regain, city 
officials said they plan to challenge the figures if they are not revised in 
time to ensure that the tourist-attracting burg gets its fair share of gasoline 
taxes, motor vehicle registration fees and other money divvied up according to 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's showing that Sausalito has lost 500 people in the last 10 years, that 
just cannot be the case," Rose said. About 200 homes have been built in the 
city over the last 10 years, and just a few houses have been torn down, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials said they knew that counting the area's more than 1,500 boat 
dwellers could prove tricky, so they have made a special effort to pick up 
those they may have missed. Besides, they said, there is plenty of time for 
local officials to point out and help correct errors before the count is final. 
</P>
<P>
The president of a homeowners association representing 450 floating abodes 
moored just outside the Sausalito city limits said census takers missed him and 
most of his neighbors. Rose and her family live on a refurbished 65-foot 
tugboat, and their pier-side neighborhood went overlooked until mop-up census 
counters went door to door at Galilee Harbor in late July. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials said last week they were not sure whether those late sweep 
results arrived in time to be thrown into the preliminary head count. They 
vowed that they would continue their visits to the area's harbors until the 
last seafaring resident has been counted. 
</P>
<P>
The hilly, spread-out geography of Sausalito and surrounding Marin County make 
the area difficult for census workers, said Dolores Brooks, census district 
office manager for Marin and two other Northern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the boat owners may be compounding the problem by avoiding 
the count, according to veteran live-in owners and census officials. Many boat 
owners view privacy as a means of preserving their way of life. This has been 
particularly true since 1986, when state officials and some local residents -- 
concerned about possible sewage pollution in harbors -- tried unsuccessfully to 
outlaw "live-aboards" in Sausalito's harbors and "anchorouts" who live 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
There may be other reasons for the low count. Some said the preliminary 
population figures probably don't include many people who, like boat residents, 
have unusual mail delivery arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
In the town of Ross, where nearly all residents receive mail through post 
office boxes, census figures show more than 20% fewer homes than state finance 
officials previously estimated, said Kim Hansen, senior planner in Marin 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The counting problem seems to extend beyond Sausalito. Countywide, Marin grew 
by just 2%, according to the preliminary census figures. Census tallies show 
about 2,000 fewer homes in the 222,568-population county than state officials 
have estimated, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sausalito officials put together their own preliminary estimates of 
the money they would lose if the 7% population drop is allowed to stand when 
the census is completed in October. The city would lose $31 a head in motor 
vehicle registration money, the most costly part of what would be the loss of 
about 0.33% of a $7.4-million operating budget.

OFFICIALS NATIONWIDE HEAPING DISCREDIT ON 1990 COUNT; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: AN UNDERCOUNT IS BEING CHARGED. CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN AID TO CITIES HANG IN THE BALANCE.

Relying on independent data, their own estimates and gut instincts about urban 
populations, city officials in California and across the country are heaping 
discredit on the 1990 Census, charging that preliminary results of the census 
are too low -- by anywhere from 2% to 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars in aid to cities, as well as seats in the U.S. Congress, 
rest on the outcome of the census -- an increasingly difficult task to count 
one by one a mobile and uncooperative population of 250 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The final census will be reported to President Bush by the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the figure for Los Angeles -- 3,420,000 -- could be as much 
as 10% off, and New York City officials say the bureau's count of 7,033,000 
could be 1 million in error. Other cities ranging from San Francisco to Chicago 
to Detroit to Houston echoed similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The big losers could be major industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. 
Although cities in rapidly growing states such as California stand to gain much 
because of flight to the Sun Belt over the last decade, few cities even in 
those areas are satisfied with the government's figures. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Los Angeles, New York and other cities contend that the 
preliminary figures suffer from the same flaw that beset the 1980 Census -- a 
5% or greater undercount of non-English-speaking immigrants, illegal aliens and 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe that as these populations have swelled over the last 
decade, the undercount has become more pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these complaints, the Census Bureau stresses the preliminary 
nature of figures released earlier this week, and emphasized that canvassing is 
still going on. Bureau officials also said that local authorities will have a 
chance to challenge the figures over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
City officials don't put much stock in the challenge because under the law they 
are not allowed to contest the number of people, just the number of households. 
</P>
<P>
If the census has failed to accurately count the number of people living in the 
houses, there is no way to correct that mistake, the cities argue. And in many 
large cities with poor and immigrant families doubling up, it is easy to make 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, local officials across the country said the bureau's tally of 
housing units does not match their own records drawn from such sources as 
public utilities and building permits and the cities' own estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking census official said Friday that communities should not be 
alarmed if the population figures seem low. 
</P>
<P>
"People are reacting to the population count," said Edwin B. Wagner Jr., 
assistant division chief for operations at the Census Bureau in Washington. "We 
provided that for information only," and those figures are expected to climb as 
a result of the ongoing canvassing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real focus needs to be to review these counts of housing units" by cities 
that feel they are being undercounted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is not always easy, some local authorities countered, especially in cities 
such as Los Angeles that have a high number of illegal immigrants and others 
who would prefer that the government not know they are here. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the census has missed "about 18,000 units," said Jessica Heinz, 
deputy city attorney. Heinz also believes the census listed a lot of housing 
units as vacant that are actually occupied -- including garages and facilities 
that house large numbers of illegals -- but the census does not allow 
provisions for local authorities to challenge the number of units listed as 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The count "is off (low) by as much as 10%," said Heinz. That "undercounting" 
could cost the city millions in both federal and state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure a person is worth about 65 bucks a year in state money" alone, Heinz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion is the state Department of Finance's figures. For 
example, the department's estimate of Los Angeles' population is close to the 
census count. But department officials question the accuracy of their figures 
for some of the same reasons that the census figures have been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
According to Linda Gage, demographer for the Department of Finance, the state's 
estimate does not count homeless people and does not accurately measure the 
number of people in a given household. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one is accurate," Gage said, referring to the state count and the 
preliminary census. "Ours is an estimate and subject to all the errors you can 
make when you're making an estimate. And the census bureau number is 
preliminary and will certainly change." 
</P>
<P>
One city, Detroit, is in a uniquely difficult position. 
</P>
<P>
Juliet Okotie-Eboh, chief of data analysis for Detroit's Planning Department, 
said the census is about 140,000 too low, and that could translate into a 
devastating loss for the city. Detroit, by far Michigan's largest city, 
benefits from state legislation that was tailored specifically for cities of a 
million or more inhabitants. The preliminary census puts Detroit's population 
at 970,000. 
</P>
<P>
That drop, from 1.2 million in 1980, will cost the city dearly if it cannot be 
boosted by 30,000, and Okotie-Eboh said she believes the city will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we're going to get it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials expect the numbers to change, partly as a result of 
"post-census local review," the process that allows local officials to 
challenge the number of housing units in the preliminary count. But that task 
is made more difficult by the fact that the bureau does not provide local 
officials with addresses to protect the confidentiality of the census. So 
instead, local governments are given the number of housing units for specific 
blocks within the area. 
</P>
<P>
It is then up to local authorities to compare that number with their own 
records. 
</P>
<P>
But some feel that is not a satisfactory approach and will still end up falling 
far short of the actual number of residents. That is of particular concern to 
New York City, which has lost a million residents during the last decade, 
according to the latest census. 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1980 census, the "post-census local review," as the housing 
verification is called, made very little difference, according to David Golden, 
assistant counsel for New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"It added something like 76,000 people nationwide to the overall count," Golden 
said. "And it reallocated only 56,000 people geographically." 
</P>
<P>
"That was the extent of its impact," he said of the review process. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities across the country are hoping for far more, and they are 
compiling as much evidence as they can get in hopes of proving the bureau 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Chow, assistant director for planning and development for Houston, said 
he could not understand how the federal count should have been as far off as 
his records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found they have misreported some 10,000 units in one southwest area 
alone," Chow said. He said he believes the bureau may have missed 200,000 
units, including "588 units on one block which they identified as three units," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"They just missed it."

CANDIDATES LAUNCH FALL CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON: HE PUSHES CRIME AND FEAR OF VICTIMIZATION, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN, AS 
PRINCIPALISSUES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Emphasizing issues that propelled two successive generations of Republicans to 
thegovernorship, Pete Wilson opened his general election campaign Monday with a 
hard-line appealon the bellwether concern of crime. 
</P>
<P>
In front of a bandstand on a placid Labor Day here, Wilson aimed repeated jabs 
at Democraticopponent, Dianne Feinstein and a "handful of arrogant liberals" he 
said had created a climate where crime could proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by correctional officers, Wilson directed comments specifically at 
Feinstein and her political ally, Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sick of excuses. We will not accept them," he said. "We cannot have a 
California,in which we call ourselves a civilized state, where women fear the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican senator, here and in an earlier appearance in Orange County, 
vowed to enforce the death penalty and rid Californians of what he suggested 
was a pervasive fear of victimization. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a fundamental right, as does every Californian, not to be a crime 
victim," Wilson told about 150 sheriffs' deputies and their families at a Labor 
Day picnic in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"This state will not be under siege to rapists or thugs or sellers of crack 
cocaine," he added in Folsom, before several hundred picnickers who had 
gathered at a park near the state prison. 
</P>
<P>
While he sounded harsh rhetoric on crime and punishment, Wilson offered no firm 
solutions for the state's pressing fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from reporters in Fountain Valley, he flatly ruled out an 
increase in the state's income tax to deal with future budget deficits. But he 
left the door distinctly open to raising revenues in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot responsibly say that I will not impose new taxes," Wilson said. "I do 
not like the idea of taxing earnings. . . . I do not wish to increase that. 
That's one that I would rule out." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in Folsom, he said that state budget-cutting imperatives included 
rethinking the amount of money that goes to education via Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is a priority," said Wilson, whose current campaign commercial urges 
a greater investment in schools and children. "But I don't think that means you 
can ignore all other requests." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the state's financial prospects, Wilson said that "there is a 
built-in deficit awaiting the next governor." 
</P>
<P>
The senator's emphasis on conservative positions on crime and income taxes -- 
issues that helped fuel the campaigns of Republican Govs. George Deukmejian and 
Ronald Reagan -- came as a counterpoint to his television ads, which accent his 
moderate positions on education and social services. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson's official kick-off to the general election campaign was absent any 
sort of overarching, thematic explanation of where he would like to take the 
state of California. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, customary campaign touches: Wilson backed by dozens of 
deputies and correctional officers at the two picnic sites, accepting gifts of 
jackets and an honorary membership in the Assn. of Orange County Deputy 
Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley picnic, sponsored by the local deputies' association, was 
held at Mile Square Park, where Reagan launched his presidential election drive 
on Labor Day in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Folsom, Wilson was even goaded into trying on an Indian war bonnet, which he 
modeled for the cameras. The war bonnet came in handy given the day's tone. 
Negative references to Feinstein escalated as the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to blunt the impact of her conservative positions on crime -- which are 
quite similar to his -- Wilson invoked Speaker Brown's name repeatedly, and 
also revived the images of Rose Elizabeth Bird, former state Supreme Court 
chief justice, who was turned out by voters in 1986, and the man who appointed 
Bird -- former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In both Fountain Valley and Folsom, Wilson chided Feinstein as a campaign-year 
convert on crime issues, accusing her of wanting to take a 'ride-along' with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
In his later appearance in Northern California, he also forcefully pronounced 
his support for Proposition 139, the November initiative that would compel 
state prisoners to work. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, Feinstein had not publicly declared a position on the initiative. 
But Monday she announced that she supports it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson appeared to direct much of his anti-crime message to women. Repeatedly, 
he brought up the crime of rape as one that has enshrouded women in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to see to it that women need not fear to walk from the job to their 
car in the parking lot," he said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has made concerted efforts this campaign year to court women, fearful 
that Feinstein might skim off the votes of moderate Republican women in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
But his campaign director, Otto Bos, denied that Wilson had aimed his 
anti-crime message specifically toward women. "It's a crime message for both 
men and women," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
The senator's appearance in Fountain Valley was interrupted briefly by 
protesters who shouted their request that Wilson sign a pledge not to spray 
malathion in the event of future infestations of the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
He refused, but said that he supported spending more money on research into 
alternative solutions.

Three state troopers were injured and 25 people were arrested during an annual 
live pigeon shoot Monday after protesters rushed onto a field and tried to free 
the caged birds. 
</P>
<P>
Several fistfights broke out, a skunk was thrown at demonstrators and one 
protester kicked out the windshield of a car before state police stopped the 
protest at the 57th Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot in Hegins. 
</P>
<P>
Participants pay to shoot birds released from cages, and the proceeds are used 
to maintain a park in this small east-central Pennsylvania town. Fourteen 
people with fake blood dripping from their mouths ran onto the field at 
different times to free the animals. Spectators chanted "Shoot!" as state 
policemen tried to handcuff the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 people who rushed the field were charged with criminal trespass. An 
additional 11 demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct. The officers 
suffered only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,800 birds were killed Monday, organizers of the shoot said.

DEFICIT MAKING FEDERAL LAYOFFS A SERIOUS THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
MILLIONS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ARE UPSET BY WARNINGS OF A 22-DAY FURLOUGH.

<P>
This time, Bob Clark, a customs inspector on the U.S.-Mexico border at San 
Ysidro, Calif., is genuinely nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Clark knows that each fall, when budget negotiations between the White House 
and Congress bog down, the government threatens to lay off thousands of federal 
employees as a way of living within its means. Most of the workers usually take 
those threats with a grain of salt, because the layoffs almost never occur; the 
last were in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, Clark -- and virtually all the federal government's 2.4 
million employees -- have received formal notices warning that they will be 
furloughed for up to 22 days beginning Oct. 1 -- and they're taking that very 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"This has happened in other years, but not to this degree," Clark said. "They 
(Bush Administration policy-makers) are serious about it, and I think it's 
actually going to happen unless Congress and the White House can get together 
on the budget." 
</P>
<P>
With the budget negotiations still deadlocked and the federal deficit growing 
even bigger as a result of rising oil prices and military spending, Clark and 
other federal workers are becoming increasingly fearful that the White House 
will be forced to impose huge spending cuts mandated for Oct. 1 by the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
If the furloughs actually take place, they will amount to unprecedented federal 
pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that federal workers are taking the warnings seriously this year is 
that never before has the government undertaken such a massive mailing of 
layoff notices. 
</P>
<P>
Clark says that this time, for example, unlike other years, every Customs 
Service agent at the Mexican border has received a furlough notice. No longer 
is the government making any distinction between non-essential and essential 
personnel. As a result, if the cuts go through, drug interdiction searches and 
other border inspections will be sharply curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
"Gates along the border will have to be closed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White House and congressional budget negotiators say they are determined to 
work out a deal before the Oct. 1 deadline and avoid the massive reductions in 
public services that would be required under Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Administration has ordered every department and agency to 
come up with contingency plans for meeting the Gramm-Rudman-required cuts, 
which add up to roughly $100 billion for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although skeptics have dismissed this as a ploy to pressure Congress, Constance 
Newman, director of the Office of Personnel Management, insisted in an 
interview that the government is not just bluffing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a negotiating tool" in the budget talks with Congress, Newman 
said. "Yes, it is drastic, but, unless something happens on the budget, it is 
real. I tell people they should take this seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the required reductions -- equal to 32.4% of the domestic budget and 
35.3% of all military programs that have not been excluded because of the 
Middle East crisis -- would be so severe they would virtually force the 
civilian side of the government to end many services. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The FBI, for example, said that it has submitted a plan for eliminating a 
staggering 6,160 staff jobs to comply with the White House order. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Justice Department's Criminal Division has warned that it would be 
"unable to carry out its mandate" in prosecuting cases of savings and loan 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service said that the required cuts 
would force the agency to impose four-hour delays at land ports of entry 
because of staff furloughs. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side expects that agreement can be reached on spending cuts anywhere 
near the levels required under Gramm-Rudman, so the two sides will have to 
reach accord on some legislative means of circumventing those "automatic" 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Federal workers will have to sweat it out until some compromise is reached and, 
increasingly, they are angered at being left in the middle. Clark and several 
hundred others demonstrated in front of the White House last week, chanting: 
"Furlough George!" 
</P>
<P>
Argent Acosta, a customs inspector from New Orleans who was picketing with 
Clark, said: "I know one thing. It's not my fault they don't have a budget 
agreement."

PAPER TRAIL GETS HOOSIER OUT OF IRAQ

AMMAN, Jordan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Clay, a burly German-Irish Hoosier with mustache and beer belly, doesn't 
look much like a Filipino. But he made a daring escape from Kuwait disguised as 
one -- with fake Philippine documents ingeniously forged by a loyal friend. 
</P>
<P>
Clay, 46, managed to slip across the Iraqi-Jordanian frontier last week with 34 
Filipino employees by pretending he was one of them. He had to hide for three 
days in the Iraqi capital -- swarming with Saddam Hussein's secret police and 
their army of informers -- and tough out a heart-stopping encounter with Iraqi 
border guards. 
</P>
<P>
His one-page travel document was a masterpiece of fakery. A Filipino instrument 
technician spent 10 days duplicating the Philippines Embassy seal and a 
creating a long inscription in tiny English characters. 
</P>
<P>
The stamp was fashioned from a rubber shower sandal; the black ink was made 
purple by diluting it with milk. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the American construction manager Richard Eugene Clay became Ricardo 
Erazo. His hometown of Bloomington, Ind., where his wife Claudia and three 
children were waiting, became Batangas City in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Clay's appearance posed problems. 
</P>
<P>
Filipinos tend to be small and slender, dark-eyed and dark-haired. But Clay's 
face is a great red expanse of rugged terrain, with a prominent sunburned nose 
and distinctly European eyes. And he has a large U.S. Navy tattoo on his right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, Clay supervised 500 Filipino and Indian workers at M. W. Kellogg, a 
U.S. contractor that maintained two oil refineries in the emirate. He accounted 
for all but four of them and then prepared to escape himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When everything else was ready, I told 'em to go out and steal two buses," 
Clay said. 
</P>
<P>
His small convoy made it to Baghdad after two traffic accidents and some close 
shaves on the border. At each roadblock, Filipino friends stood in the bus door 
and passed out his papers. 
</P>
<P>
The group was stuck in Baghdad for three days, which Clay spent huddling 
between the others in a car or hiding in three hotel rooms with 128 others. 
</P>
<P>
He rented another bus for the equivalent of $5,000 for the seven-hour drive to 
the Jordan border. By then, his party had grown by 25 Filipino women. 
</P>
<P>
The tough part was getting out of Iraq. Clay cleared every hurdle, finally 
garnering the treasured exit stamp on his false travel document. Then, at a 
last check before entering Jordan, an Iraqi guard stuck his head into the bus. 
</P>
<P>
He glared at Clay and said: "Marine?" 
</P>
<P>
"Filipino," said Clay. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi took him off the bus for six hours of interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
But his friends rallied around him. They piled their luggage across the road, 
insisting that if Clay was returned to Baghdad, they'd go too. 
</P>

Arab troops in Saudi Arabia have no charter to join any offensive action to 
liberate Kuwait, and some Arab officials fear that tough talk in the United 
States and the Persian Gulf about ending Saddam Hussein's reign in Iraq has 
hampered recent efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution, a leading Arab 
diplomat said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dangerous situation. All the ingredients for explosion are there. 
Anybody, any incident, could start a war now, and if this is started, nobody 
knows how it will end," said the official, who, along with other diplomats from 
Arab and Muslim countries, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats emphasized that the role of the Arab and Islamic multinational 
force now in Saudi Arabia is limited to defending that country's territory. The 
senior official said that the only circumstance under which Arab troops would 
enter Kuwait would be as "a peacekeeping force, to replace the Iraqi forces, 
but not to fight them." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Morocco, Syria and Pakistan have all sent troops to join a 10,000-man 
permanent force from six Persian Gulf nations currently deployed near Saudi 
Arabia's northern border with Kuwait and Iraq. Additional troops from 
Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Arabic forces report to Saudi military commanders, and one Arab diplomat 
helping oversee their operation said that any attempt to use them in connection 
with an American offensive against Iraq or Kuwait "would not be in conformity 
with their mission." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious thing, and it would be against the agreement that is 
now in place," he said, adding that the present terms of deployment are both 
political and pragmatic. "With the small amount of our force, it will serve a 
much more useful purpose if we are left to a defensive role in Saudi Arabia," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad on Monday, the ruling party newspaper Thawra belittled a pledge by 
the Saudi defense minister that American forces would not mount an invasion of 
Kuwait from Saudi soil. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis could not control the Americans, the Baath Socialist Party organ 
charged, referring to Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz's remark at a Saturday press 
conference. "It is the Pentagon and not the slave Sultan that decides the tasks 
of these forces," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Arab officials said efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution are under way in 
Jordan, Libya and most recently, Algeria and other North African countries, but 
one official says they have been hampered by statements from U.S., Saudi and 
other officials declaring that Hussein must be removed from the helm in Iraq if 
there is to be any long-term stability in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very dangerous. We should abstain from threatening Saddam Hussein 
personally. If somebody is cornered from all circles, he will not compromise. 
He will fight. There must be an escape route, a way out," the official 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
"If he thinks that time is in his favor, the process of peaceful settlement 
could start to work, as long as he is convinced that the goal is not his neck. 
If he is convinced the Americans are here for that, then there is no formula 
for a peaceful solution. Then war is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the foreign ministers of five Arab League nations ended a two-day 
meeting by adopting a working document -- its contents were kept secret -- to 
be relayed to the leaders of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia 
for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers' closed-door discussions were believed to have included seeking 
an "Arab solution" to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. A source close to the 
discussions said Monday there was a "broad convergence of views." 
</P>
<P>
The five North African countries took opposing sides at the Arab League vote 
last month in Cairo on whether to support sending troops to the multinational 
peacekeeping force. Morocco voted in favor of sending troops, Libya against and 
Algeria and Mauritania abstained. Tunisia boycotted the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Arab diplomats who spoke in Saudi Arabia said they could not 
discuss the precise number of Arab and other Islamic troops currently deployed 
or on their way to the region. The overall present deployment is thought to be 
less than 20,000, counting the 10,000-strong Peninsula Shield force from the 
Persian Gulf countries. A U.S. official said the arrival of new Arab and 
Islamic troops has in some cases been delayed by Saudi Arabia's temporary 
inability to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these Arab troops that arrived came with nothing but the clothes on 
their backs . . . and it's a fantastic expense and strain on the Saudi 
logistics system to support those people," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials may in some cases be trying not to appear overly eager to 
welcome large numbers of new Arab troops in an attempt to hold down the cost 
they will eventually have to pay for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just that the Saudis want Arab troops but that the Arab troops think 
they'll get paid. There's a certain amount of bargaining going on . . . and at 
some point, even Saudi money is not infinite." 
</P>
<P>
Financial arrangements with most of the Arab and Islamic countries have not 
been disclosed, and in most cases have yet to be fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd recently announced that the kingdom is donating $100 
million to Egypt to help "lessen the suffering" of Egyptian workers in Iraq and 
Kuwait displaced by the crisis, and U.S. officials said this week that they 
plan to forgive Egypt's $7.1 billion military debt, an action that had been 
under discussion even before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian soldiers have been arriving equipped with combat gear, rifles, 
ammunition, electrical generators and other equipment but have been dependent 
on the Saudis primarily for tents and catering. A recent tour of a Moroccan 
troop site showed that many of the troops had no tents and were outfitted in 
sandals. 
</P>
<P>
Most Arab and Islamic diplomats vigorously denied that financial compensation 
or the promise of jobs for their nationals in Saudi Arabia played any role in 
the decision to send troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deep, deep emotional commitment to Saudi Arabia, the site of the two 
holy shrines (of Islam), that goes much deeper than just workers," said one 
official.

SOVIETS WARN OF A BACKFIRE OVER BUILDUP; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: KREMLIN CAUTIOUSLY ENDORSES U.S. MILITARY MOVES BUT SAYS THE MASSIVE 
PRESENCE COULD CAUSE ARABS TO COALESCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union on Monday cautiously endorsed the U.S. military buildup in the 
Persian Gulf but warned Washington that its massive presence is becoming a new 
issue around which hard-line Arabs would coalesce and that is obscuring the 
original issue, Iraq's seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing both understanding for U.S. motives but also fears for the region if 
Washington uses military force, Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry's chief spokesman, sketched the probable approach that President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take on the gulf crisis in his talks in Helsinki, 
Finland, on Sunday with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the Kremlin's call for a political settlement of the crisis 
based on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and other terms set out by the U.N. 
Security Council last month, Gerasimov stressed the danger that Moscow sees of 
a major conflict in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans say that they do not want to have a war," Gerasimov told a news 
briefing. "But the situation is complicated, and some people feel that Israel 
is going to prod the United States to close this chapter with (Iraq's 
President) Saddam Hussein. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The United States understands that its presence and, in particular, the 
reinforcement of that presence will to some extent help Saddam Hussein 
consolidate the anti-American bloc. Now everyone begins to forget the original 
cause of the developments -- that Kuwait was seized and international law was 
violated." 
</P>
<P>
But Gerasimov, dismissing as "personal opinion" and "conjectural" recent 
criticism from other Soviet officials of the U.S. buildup, stressed Moscow's 
basic sympathy with most of the Bush Administration's actions in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans appeared there (in the gulf) not on their own initiative, but 
they were provoked into it by Iraqi actions," he said, adding that the United 
States had come to the defense of Saudi Arabia at the kingdom's request. "Their 
objective is to protect that country against possible aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, however, Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, the commander of Warsaw Pact 
forces, had outlined a menacing scenario in which U.S. forces continued to 
increase in the gulf region and across Southwest Asia, strengthening the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization encirclement of the Soviet Union. Washington's 
moves have already imperiled a treaty reducing conventional armed forces in 
Europe, Lobov said. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not say that, and I cannot see the connection," Gerasimov commented. "I 
see no direct link." 
</P>
<P>
A deputy foreign minister expressed concerns similar to Lobov's to a 
legislative committee last week, reflecting the widely different Soviet views 
on the crisis. A commentator in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said 
Sunday that chances of war are "50-50" and that a "military solution" would 
have grave consequences for superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
But the government newspaper Izvestia, looking ahead to the Bush-Gorbachev 
summit, on Monday backed the American President's swift reaction to Iraq's 
seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush had no other choice under the conditions offered by Hussein, and his 
resolute action prevented two worse possibilities, an attack on Saudi Arabia 
and a possible Iraqi success," senior commentator Stanislav Kondrashev wrote. 
"Besides, the speedy military buildup of U.S. forces and their allies created 
military pressure on the aggressor without which the effectiveness of economic 
and political pressure would be greatly diminished." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov, speaking for the top Soviet leadership in advance of the summit, 
stressed that Gorbachev sees the one-day meeting with Bush in Helsinki as a 
significant break with the Cold War tactics in which the two superpowers played 
each international crisis for their own advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of prompting arranged, trustful contacts at the summit level fits 
in perfectly with the new fiber of Soviet-American dialogue, based on the 
renunciation of Cold War stereotypes and the transition to interaction on a 
wide range of problems," Gerasimov said. "Such personal meetings, both 
presidents believe, offer a unique possibility to compare notes on the 
fast-changing situation, grasp each other's initial reasoning better and, 
consequently, help enhance constructive trends and resist adverse tendencies in 
world development." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union is not attempting to mediate in the gulf conflict, 
Gerasimov suggested that Gorbachev would have some ideas to put to Bush on ways 
that the crisis might be eased and a way opened to a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it would be possible to come up with some formula to reduce the number 
of forces there under international guarantees," Gerasimov suggested, again 
stressing the Soviet preference for political means, such as a phased 
de-escalation and military pullbacks, to ensure the implementation of the U.N. 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials anticipate that Bush will press Gorbachev to pull out the 193 
military advisers the Soviet Union still has in Iraq training its troops to use 
and maintain weapons Moscow has sold the Iraqis. The Izvestia commentary said 
the Soviet Union feared that Iraq would halt payments on $6 billion in debts if 
the advisers, supplied under long-term contracts, are withdrawn.

A Riverside County man nearly completed a record-setting, transcontinental 
flight in a solar-powered airplane Monday, but was forced to land nine miles 
short of his final destination. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Eric Raymond, 33, of Lake Elsinore, set his homemade aircraft down in a 
farmer's field after an ominous storm front rolled in and blocked out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Savier, a member of the flight crew, said conditions were so poor Monday 
that Raymond was flying just 1,500 feet above the woods of coastal North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"It is treacherous terrain," Savier said. "There's a lot of swampland and a lot 
of trees and Eric says he can swim but he can't climb trees." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond is expected to complete the final leg of his landmark journey and land 
today at Kitty Hawk, N.C., the birthplace of engine-powered aviation.

MOSCOVITES SHORT OF BREAD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS

Soviet citizens are used to waiting in line for bananas, paying under the table 
for meat and using ration coupons for sugar. But bread, that staple of the 
Russian diet, was always fresh and plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Now that has changed. On Monday, Soviets lined up for bread at stores across 
Moscow for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
Many were grumbling, blaming President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms for 
shortages of a growing list of products that includes tobacco, paper, cheese 
and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Russian bread, which is chewy but wholesome -- and cheap, because of government 
subsidies -- had been one of the few products Soviet consumers could count on. 
The last time people remember long bread lines was under Premier Nikita S. 
Khrushchev, who was ousted from power in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"That's perestroika -- we're not moving forward, we're going backward," said 
Viktor Lyubeznov, a 52-year-old electrician who went to four Moscow bread 
stores before finding a loaf. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we think freely, we speak freely, but the economic situation is more 
severe than ever," said Irina Samoruppa, 65. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage could undermine support for the political and economic reforms -- 
known as perestroika -- initiated by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Moscow's Bread Store No. 150 on Monday, tempers flared as customers 
accused saleswomen of saving the last few loaves of white bread for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, people stood in clusters, commiserating and arguing. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my life have I ever had to search for bread before," said Anatoly 
Znamensky, a 66-year-old retired taxi driver. "Vegetables, fruit, cheese, 
butter, meat -- they appear and disappear. But with bread there was never a 
problem, until now." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything will be fine," said Samoruppa. "It isn't possible for this to 
continue very long." 
</P>
<P>
The bread shortage, which began late last week and worsened over the weekend, 
appeared to be limited primarily to Moscow, although bread rationing has been 
introduced in Tarusa, a small city to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said the capital's bakeries were unable to keep up with the sudden 
rise in demand when residents returned from their traditional August vacations. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not a lack of grain. A record harvest is expected this year. The 
Soviet newspaper Izvestia said the bottleneck is Moscow's central bread 
bakeries, which have undergone little expansion or modernization since the 
1950s, when the population was about half the current 8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage could be especially hard on the city's retirees. Some receive 
pensions of only $48 to $96 a month and survive largely on bread, which costs 
between 11 and 18 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of bread comes on the heels of a summer-long shortage of tobacco, 
which led to street demonstrations in Moscow and strikes in other Russian 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, gasoline has become hard to find. Hard cheese has virtually 
disappeared from stores in Moscow in recent weeks. As school reopened, shelves 
were bare of the notebooks children are required to use in class. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the shortages, however, bread is potentially the most politically 
troubling, if only because of its historical symbolism. When Lenin returned 
from exile to lead the revolution in 1917, his slogan promised communism would 
bring "Peace, Land and Bread."

Heavily armed Canadian soldiers Monday tightened their perimeter around a group 
of armed and defiant Mohawk Indians who refused to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Army spokeswoman Capt. Lynne Bermel said the army moved several hundred yards 
closer to "The Pines," an Indian alcohol and drug treatment center on the 
Kanesatake reserve, west of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Oneida Nation Chief Terry Doxtator told reporters outside the treatment center 
that the remaining Mohawk Warriors "will not lay down their arms if the army 
moves in." 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen members of the Mohawk Warriors and an unknown number of women 
and children were reportedly holed up in the treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute in Oka began several months ago over a proposed expansion of the 
town's golf course on land that Mohawks on the Kanesatake reserve claim is an 
ancient burial ground. It turned violent on July 11, when a provincial police 
officer was killed.

TOXIC CLOUD FROM FIRE FORCES 800 TO EVACUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A toxic cloud from a fire in a La Verne computer parts manufacturing company 
forced the evacuation of about 800 residents Sunday night and sent eight 
individuals, including three firefighters and two police officers to the 
hospital, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those evacuated, including residents of nearby mobile home parks, were 
out of their homes for nearly 24 hours before officials declared the area safe 
about 4 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was discovered about 8:30 p.m. Sunday at the Super Tech plant at 1st 
and E streets, fire officials said. The eight injured, including two residents, 
experienced "major" headaches, nausea and blurred vision, said La Verne Police 
Lt. Jim Crawford, who ordered the evacuation. All were treated at Pomona Valley 
Hospital and released.

SMASHING DESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: JUMBLED WALLS, ZIGZAG ROOFS? L.A.'S FIRST TASTE OF 
DECONSTRUCTIVISM IS SOON TO BE SEEN ON MELROSE AVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

recent book is The Watts Towers of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Come 1992, passers-by may be startled by the structure at Melrose Avenue and 
Alta Vista Boulevard. At first glance, it may look like an architectural 
smash-up with its jumbled walls, crazy zigzag roofs, teetering towers and steel 
piers flying off at all angles. 
</P>
<P>
But these sights will be carefully considered parts of Melrose One, a new 
shopping center with a groundbreaking set for this fall. It will be Los 
Angeles' first truly Deconstructivist building. 
</P>
<P>
Deconstructivism, an extreme twist in the post-Modernist evolution of 
architecture, is a highly mannered search for meaning that upends established 
rules of design. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for Melrose One initially may seem the work of a demented designer 
following his own mad logic -- a logic that sets out to confuse settled notions 
of buildings as straight up-and-down structures. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing accidental about Melrose One's apparent logical confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by architect Wolf Prix of the Viennese firm of Coop Himmelblau for 
West Coast Investments, Melrose One -- which will include a restaurant, a 
champagne bar, a bookshop and a dress boutique -- is a dramatic example of the 
latest explosion in the architectural style wars. 
</P>
<P>
Deconstructivism, celebrated in a trend-setting 1988 show mounted by New York's 
Museum of Modern Art, is defined as a fusion of destruction and Constructivism. 
</P>
<P>
The Deconstructivists draw on the powerful, popular imagery expressed by 
Russian Constructivists in the 1920s. Such populist imagery is strongly 
influenced by a profound disillusion with Modernist architecture, in 
particular, and with the whole notion of "progress," in general. 
</P>
<P>
Where Russian Constructivism was socially concerned and essentially optimistic, 
Deconstructivism is pessimistic in its conviction that contemporary life has as 
much potential for destruction as creation. 
</P>
<P>
Writing of Coop Himmelblau's 1985 Deconstructivist rooftop remodeling of a 
traditional Viennese attic, the MOMA catalogue essay described "a form that has 
been distorted by some alien organism, a writhing, disruptive animal breaking 
through (so that) the roof splits, shears and buckles." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the essay stresses, this radical distortion of standard architectural 
forms is intended as a revitalization of stale styles: "What is finally so 
unsettling about such work is precisely that the form not only survives its 
torture, but appears all the stronger for it." 
</P>
<P>
Prix, an architect who opened a branch office in West Los Angeles in 1988, 
explained his Melrose One intentions more simply, saying: "I want to destroy 
the boxy shape that imprisons the typical Melrose Avenue building. I want to 
break open the box, slice it, tilt it, mix it all up. Out of this apparent 
destruction, a new form emerges." 
</P>
<P>
He calls his Melrose One design "a parody of the box" -- a parody "that makes 
you think about the nature of architectural boxes, in general, and why we've 
allowed ourselves to be trapped in them for so long." 
</P>
<P>
By creating his artful parody, he hopes his building will be "memorable." 
</P>
<P>
"As they walk or drive down the avenue, people will see the normal panorama of 
the street disturbed," Prix said. "They will take notice. They will know 
they're entering a special place -- the distinctive Melrose district. They will 
be forced to see rather than just look." 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue is the perfect place for an exercise in Deconstructivism, Prix 
said. The Melrose transformation of a typical Angeleno commercial strip into a 
fashionable parade ground is, in itself, an expression of a maturing city's 
desire to "break out of its box" of boring streets lined with undistinguished 
one- and two-story shops and stores. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its eccentricity, Melrose One employs standard, local building 
materials. The zigzag roofs that float freely over its jumbled shapes are 
folded sheet metal; metal poles thrust at angles support the roof; stucco and 
wood sheath the tilted walls. 
</P>
<P>
The "flying" roofs are vital elements in the composition, what Prix calls its 
"fifth facade." Their seeming confusion acts as a splintered, yet sheltering 
umbrella for the complex composition below. There, the walls collide or shoot 
past one another as if on their way to someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
The glass-walled champagne bar that dominates the corner of Melrose and Alta 
Vista is framed in lightweight steel. The bar includes a private room set on an 
elevator platform. Parties that rent it can decide just how high up the tower 
they would like to be to overlook the street below. 
</P>
<P>
In all their designs, from the remodeling of Vienna's Ronacher Theatre to plans 
for the new town of Melun-Senart outside Paris, Coop Himmelblau's architects 
say they strive for an intuitive response that allows them to "deconstruct" the 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the usual two-stage process by which architects first analyze, then 
solve a building program, Coop Himmelblau designers scribble preliminary ideas 
on scraps of tracing paper without prior analysis, "with our eyes shut and our 
minds open," Prix said. 
</P>
<P>
"With our eyes shut" is a literal statement. The house Coop Himmelblau 
conceived one cold day in Vienna, and which eventually was commissioned by a 
client in Malibu, was the result of shut-eyed dreaming without plan or purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Prix and his partner, Helmut Swiczinsky, founded Coop Himmelblau -- "Blue Sky 
Cooperative" -- in Vienna in 1968 as a reaction to the cookie-cutter Modernist 
architecture that then dominated the international design scene. 
</P>
<P>
As he explained in a 1968 interview, published by the London Architectural 
Assn.: "1968 was a time of disastrous warfare in Vietnam, of space exploration 
and rock-style rave-ups. There was anger on the streets in Chicago, Paris, New 
York, London and Berlin. . . . We wanted to see more vitality and fantasy in a 
kind of highly personal architecture that expressed our weaknesses as well as 
our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
Filling their Vienna studio with the discordant sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Prix 
and Swiczinsky shut their eyes and let their fingers do the drawing. They 
created an architectural commune in which every fantasy was real and every 
reality fantastical. 
</P>
<P>
"Like making music, our architecture is a spontaneous feedback process," 
Swiczinsky said. "Tossing rhythms back and forth between us produces images 
free of cliches, we hope." 
</P>
<P>
Prix, who teaches at the Santa Monica-based Southern California Institute of 
Architecture, believes "tossing rhythms back and forth" is a reason he needs 
the radical contrast of traditional Vienna and "unhistoric" Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Vienna is shut in by its past, while Los Angeles is open to all kinds of 
wonderful confusion," he said. "After a few weeks in Vienna, I begin to long 
for L.A. -- and vice versa. Together these two very different cities express 
the almost unbearable tension between static and volatile forces that could 
either create or destroy the future." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from this rather abstract attraction to Southern California, Coop 
Himmelblau has a more direct desire to tap a reservoir of Angeleno inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any aesthetic, spontaneous architecture of the kind we aspire to can 
easily become a cliche," Prix said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about Los Angeles because it blows fresh energy through our souls. 
. . . All architecture is, in the end, a matter of feeling. It has to stand or 
fall by a yardstick of the emotions."

<P>
HEALTH: THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT, NOW APPROVED FOR CHILDREN, HELPS THE DEAF 
FUNCTION IN HEARING WORLD. BUT THE DEVICE IS COSTLY AND DIFFICULT TO USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Casey Correia was 5 when he lost his hearing as a complication of meningitis, 
an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the spinal cord or brain. Hearing 
aids were of no use to the Yorba Linda boy. Within weeks of becoming deaf, his 
speech deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie and Jack Correia seized upon the only remaining alternative for their 
son: a cochlear implant. The device includes a small component surgically 
implanted in the inner ear and an external component resembling a conventional 
hearing aid, along with a small battery pack. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, a patient at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, was the first child 
in North America to receive the cochlear implant. In 1986, when he underwent 
the surgery, the device was still experimental. 
</P>
<P>
The months after the procedure were discouraging. The sounds Casey heard 
through his implant barely resembled those he remembered. In classes at a 
school for the deaf and at home, he struggled to make sense of the strange 
sounds -- similar to a radio that needed tuning -- produced by the implant. 
</P>
<P>
"About nine months after he got the implant, I was in the kitchen and he was 
watching television with his back to me. I called his name and he turned 
around," Frankie says. "It was like opening the door a little bit. I told him, 
that's what your name sounds like." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Casey, now 9, has become a model for what is possible with a 
cochlear implant. Slender and blond, with sparkling brown eyes and a nonchalant 
attitude regarding his fame, Casey now attends a regular school. By piecing 
together what he hears through the implant and by lip-reading, he functions 
normally in the hearing world. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to wear it at first," Casey says, shrugging. "But I started 
getting better at it." 
</P>
<P>
Success stories like Casey's helped pave the way for the June approval by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the cochlear implant for children. The 
device, which was approved for adults in 1985, can now be prescribed for 
children as young as 2, if they meet stringent qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA decision increases the chances that patients will receive insurance 
reimbursement for the costly device and enables dozens of hospitals to provide 
it. Previously, children could receive the implant at only the few medical 
centers charged with studying it. 
</P>
<P>
More important, says Dr. Carol Jackson, a member of the FDA advisory panel that 
approved the device for children: "The hope is to eliminate the inevitability 
of a child born deaf to be committed to a life of silence." 
</P>
<P>
But the approval has renewed a long, emotional debate in the deaf community 
about the social impact of the device on children and its practical value to 
people of any age. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics in the deaf community charge that parents who seek implants for a 
deaf child are steering the child into the hearing culture instead of accepting 
the child's deafness and the culture and lifestyle that accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
A broader criticism centers on whether the implant performs well enough to 
justify the expense -- $25,000 to $40,000 -- and the intense training required 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lisa Tonokawa, an audiologist and coordinator of the children's 
program at the House Ear Institute, the ultimate value of the cochlear implant 
for children varies widely and depends greatly on the amount of training and 
support from parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not curing their hearing loss," says Tonokawa, who has worked with the 
device for seven years. "There is still a lot of rehabilitation and a lot of 
extra work involved on the parents' part. If they are not willing to do that 
then we shouldn't implant the child because it will make no difference in the 
child's life. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to sound so negative, because sometimes it does seem like a miracle. 
But (the) kids I get real excited about are those with parents who have worked 
really hard." 
</P>
<P>
The cochlear implant, invented more than two decades ago by Australian 
researchers, is for people who are born deaf or have such profound hearing loss 
that they receive no benefit from hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
While hearing aids receive and amplify sounds, cochlear implants receive, 
process and, bypassing the injured part of the ear, deliver sound information 
to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds are picked up by a microphone worn behind the ear and routed to a speech 
processor, a calculator-sized box that is worn on a harness or clipped to a 
belt or pocket. The processor amplifies, filters and digitizes the sounds, then 
sends coded information to a receiver-stimulator, the tiny device implanted in 
the inner ear. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver-stimulator converts the code to electrical signals and passes the 
signals to electrodes. The electrodes stimulate hearing nerve fibers, which the 
brain then picks up and recognizes as sound. 
</P>
<P>
Because the implant delivers sounds only marginally similar to natural sound, 
months or years of training are required to maximize its benefits. Implant 
recipients must learn to link the sounds to events. For example, at first a 
recipient might not recognize a sound as the doorbell. After repeated exposure, 
however, the sound becomes familiar as that of the doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a very big range of what kids do with the implant," Tonokawa says. "You 
see some little kids take off and develop speech and language. But these are 
kids with very good school support and dedicated parents." 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Correia remembers following her son around and labeling each sound he 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we heard the dog bark I told him 'That's what it sounds like,' 
" she says. 
</P>
<P>
And, she says, Casey also received more than two years of auditory training at 
a school for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual training occurs outside of the medical system with usage," says 
Jackson, an associate professor and director of neurology at UCI Medical 
Center. "We don't know in advance where the child will fit in. At a minimum, 
virtually all patients will detect medium to loud sounds, including speech. 
Some can detect certain words in a sentence without lip-reading." 
</P>
<P>
Some children also develop understandable speech, but, Jackson adds: "It 
doesn't mean they don't need speech therapy and other tutorial help." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the patients who do the best with the implant are children 
who, like Casey, were deaf for a short time before receiving it. But studies 
have shown that even children who are born deaf can benefit, especially if they 
receive the device at age 2 or 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are able to do so much with so little," Jackson says. "What's 
particularly surprising is how well children with congenital loss do compared 
to adults with congenital loss." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, research on the implant in congenitally deaf children has 
yielded some interesting information about hearing development. For instance, 
young children appear to learn to use the implant quickly because their sensory 
functions are in a rapid stage of growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
"They are learning to adapt to their environment, in general," Jackson says. 
"There is another theory that sound input serves some nurturing role to the 
hearing system. With children, when you provide that sound early, you can 
promote more development." 
</P>
<P>
Tonokawa agrees that congenitally deaf children may benefit from the implant, 
although it may take them longer to master than children who lost their hearing 
after birth. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (people) who say you should not implant congenitally deaf children. 
Some people say they don't do as well," Tonokawa says. "But I'm finding that's 
not true. I think it takes them longer to get there, but they don't have a 
history of hearing. It makes sense that those kids take longer to develop." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to recommend the implant for congenitally deaf children has been 
criticized by some members of the deaf community. They have argued that the 
implant might confuse children, leaving them to straddle hearing and deaf 
environments, Tonokawa says. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, the feeling in the deaf education field and among some pediatric ear, 
nose and throat (physicians) was against implants. I think we've won them over 
by explaining that it's just a tool," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are still very negative are within the deaf community. Their 
argument is 'you're fine as a deaf person and you're part of a deaf culture and 
there is no reason to deny your deafness.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Estes, executive director of the National Assn. of the Deaf, says 
he fears that not enough is known about long-term effects of the implant, 
particularly electrical stimulation in the inner ear, a concern the FDA has 
also identified as needing further research. 
</P>
<P>
"I, personally, think that the medical profession should do a lot more public 
education; make very, very sure that a candidate for an implant understands 
what to expect before they submit to this kind of surgery," Estes says. "I know 
a growing number of deaf adults who have had the implant, and every last one of 
them, bar none, has eventually reached the point where they admit to themselves 
that it is not what it was cracked up to be. And they just discard the damn 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Cochlear Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of the Australian-based 
manufacturer of the implant, have no information on long-term use. But many 
experts admit that patients of any age must make a concerted effort to master 
the implant or it will be a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"One must be committed to relearning how to listen once they receive the 
implant," says Jean Lombard, a spokeswoman for Cochlear Corp. in Englewood, 
Colo. "They give up because it's hard. You might be set in your ways. If you 
were heavily reliant on sign language and you feel you get around and you're 
not missing anything, then the implant is work." 
</P>
<P>
Tonokawa agrees that the right attitude makes a big difference in successful 
use of the implant. Teen-agers who have been deaf for a long time often make 
poor candidates, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, parents who have neither the time nor financial resources to work 
with their child may find the implant a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
But, she says, children who learn to make the most of the implant have the 
enviable ability to feel comfortable in both hearing and deaf environments. 
</P>
<P>
"My argument is not that we're stealing them from the deaf culture, but we're 
giving them a choice," Tonokawa says. "It's a tool to give children choices as 
adults. We're not trying to change them or say deafness is bad."

FOR THIS GROUP OF MAORIS, IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
WAIWHETU CLAN STRESSES FILIAL FIDELITY AND CULTURAL PRIDE IN ITS TRADITIONAL 
SONG AND DANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE SCOTT, Scott is a staff writer at the Evening Post in Wellington, N.Z. 
who specializes in coverage of Maori issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
Family groups in the entertainment world are common but few have been as large 
as the 20 brothers, sisters and cousins who make up the Waiwhetu Maori Cultural 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Southland audiences over Labor Day weekend's opening programs at Angel's Gate 
and at the Maritime Museum in San Pedro got their first glimpse of the Puketapu 
and Luke families in traditional Maori dress as they performed songs and dances 
-- including poi dances and the intimidating haka, or war dances. 
</P>
<P>
While some performers may travel with managers and publicists in tow, the 
Maoris' most important team members are the elders -- the kaumatua and their 
female equivalent, kuia -- whose roles are to hold the group together as a unit 
and see that performances remain true to the Waiwhetu spirit. 
</P>
<P>
On the current tour, the group's farthest and most ambitious performances to 
date, Ritchie Luke, 63, wife Hina and "Aunty Betty" Winitana are the elders who 
sit in the audience and later advise members on whether their performance has 
stayed faithful to the Waiwhetu spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We perform these songs for ourselves, as an expression of who we are," Luke 
says, explaining why the group has chosen to bypass domestic tours and Maori 
competitions in New Zealand and has taken its music and dance straight to the 
"outside" world instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We will sing on our own marae (family complex), but performing in New Zealand 
has no meaning for us," Luke said. 
</P>
<P>
How can they reconcile this attitude with appearing before international 
audiences who may have little understanding of Maori culture? 
</P>
<P>
Luke sees U.S. tours as a chance to show Americans a piece of New Zealand and 
give younger family members a chance to develop Maori pride. Except for four 
teen-agers making their first trip outside the marae, most members of the group 
are veterans of two previous tours. 
</P>
<P>
Their appearances during the Los Angeles Festival were arranged last year at a 
cost expected to be $80,000 New Zealand dollars (about $48,000 U.S.). The group 
has raised 90% of its money itself and was not pleased when Saturday's program 
erroneously stated that a Rockefeller Foundation grant had partly paid for 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Waiwhetu, or "Shining Water," is a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand's capital, 
and is a tribal community for the Te Atiawa people, who came from the Taranaki 
region farther north to settle in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural, spiritual and social life for many Maori centers around the marae, 
which is a complex composed of a meeting house, grass area and eating house. At 
the turn of the century, a Te Atiawa leader, Ihaia Puketapu, decided he would 
build a meeting house for both Maori and non-Maori (Pakeha) at Waiwhetu. A 
believer in solving disputes peacefully, Ihaia decreed the house was to be a 
place of peace, friendship and goodwill to all people. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the marae has been the focal point of Te Atiawa activities in 
Wellington and the Luke association with Waiwhetu is as strong and old as that 
of the Puketapu family. Intermarriages have gone on for years, the elder Luke 
said, and there is no real distinction between the two names. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Wirangi Luke, the tour organizer, said his parents' generation formed 
the cultural group before the marae was built but it "faded out" in the 1960s 
through a lack of tutors. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, there was a renewed interest in Maori cultural activities, 
coinciding with a general revival of Maori culture throughout New Zealand. A 
number of Waiwhetu youth wanted to learn about traditional dance and song. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Luke recalls the revival coincided with the establishment of kohanga 
reo, Maori preschools that hold all their lessons in the Maori language. 
Kohanga was a '70s initiative by Maori parents who wanted to see their children 
learn the Maori language in their early years. It followed a long period when 
the use of the Maori language was in danger of dying out. 
</P>
<P>
Kohanga reo, he says, fired an enthusiasm among parents to learn Maori. For 
people in Waiwhetu, it happily coincided with Ritchie's daughter, Hinemoa, and 
her husband, Moana Priest, both educated at Maori colleges that placed a strong 
emphasis in reviving interest in the arts for young people keen to catch up on 
the lost years. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense of trying to achieve something they had not been a part of 
earlier," Wirangi says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Waiwhetu Maori Culture Group remains true to tradition in both its 
dance and harmonies in waiata (songs) common to all Maori tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Wirangi worked for Maori International, a company promoting Maori business and 
tourism. Its managing director was Luke's uncle, a Waiwhetu elder and former 
government secretary of Maori Affairs, Kara Puketapu. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Maori International began Te Maori tours, where overseas tourists, 
many of them Americans, visited different marae. The company used Waiwhetu 
marae as a testing ground because of the family ties. The group entertained 
their visitors during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Contact with foreigners made the group want to learn how their guests lived. 
Few members had been overseas and many were shy and reluctant to mingle 
confidently with visitors. Performance organizers agreed that overseas travel 
would overcome the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The tour was successful and motivated the group to tour again: In 1986, the 
unit went to San Francisco, Orange County and Hawaii. The trips, costing 
$50,000 to $60,000, were paid for through fund-raisers rather than sponsorships 
and meant the group could perform as it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show that we as a Maori culture group can perform with dignity and 
capture the American audience," Wirangi Luke says. He says the group performs 
best when the audience responds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patches of frost crunch underfoot as Randolph Padilla walks through Jemez 
Pueblo to the Turquoise clan's meeting hall, a long adobe structure with white 
and aqua interior walls, a dirt floor and a low roof supported by round wooden 
beams. It is New Year's morning. 
</P>
<P>
Firewood is piled near the single doorway and some stump-like logs are used for 
stools as people arrive. They greet one another warmly, embracing or shaking 
hands, before gathering for a communal prayer. 
</P>
<P>
A fire crackles in a low, stepped oven as they finish the business at hand: 
preparing for the Matachina dances, an annual pueblo ritual that originated in 
Spain as a celebration of Christian victory over the Turks and Moors. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely performed throughout the American Southwest and Northern Mexico in 
different versions -- with Jemez notable for preserving two contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by violin and guitar, the Turquoise clan dances a Spanish 
Matachina, festooned with scarves, ribbons and fringed shawls that somehow 
suggest the shape and splendor of antique Catholic and Turkish attire. (Silvia 
Lozano's Ballet Folclorico Nacional de Mexico included an excerpt from a 
similar Matachina dance in its January program at Ambassador Auditorium.) 
</P>
<P>
However, the Jemez Pumpkin clan dances in traditional pueblo costumes 
(moccasins instead of shoes, for instance) to male choir and drums. Each of 
these Matachina features the same characters: a young boy (the bull, 
representing evil) and girl (the malinche, representing purity), along with an 
adult leader (the monarca) who dances with them between double lines of six men 
each. 
</P>
<P>
There are also clowns -- often more threatening than funny -- and a masked old 
man (the mongala) who dances with the young girl in a refined, even courtly 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Matachina music has been traced to 16th-Century Spain, many of the 
dance steps are clearly European in origin. Some scholars detect medieval 
Spanish dance forms now obsolete in Europe, others define the whole experience 
as a composite of aboriginal Mexican dance-drama and an old Spanish miracle 
play. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Out on the sunlit plaza of Jemez Pueblo, the Matachina dances become 
a living religious experience, celebratory, life-affirming, yet deeply 
mysterious too, as befits a timeless struggle between good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the Turquoise group and a dancer in the performance, Padilla 
doesn't have time to explain American Indian culture. But, while inviting 
visitors to sample his wife's spectacular red-chili enchiladas, he manages to 
define the context of the Matachina ritual: dance as an awakening of the 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do our dances just to do them," he said. "All our dances have power. 
All of them are like a prayer to the Great Spirit for certain things. A lot of 
them are for rain, snow, long life, to have a prosperous year -- and we pray 
for these things before, during and after all the dances." 
</P>
<P>
Repeated periodically during the day, the performance draws the entire 
community onto the plaza. Some watch from their rooftops (executing the fast, 
intricate footwork along with the dancers), others set folding chairs against 
the buildings and a few visitors from nearby Albuquerque huddle in doorways to 
avoid the chill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival curator Judy Mitoma said that she was attracted to the 
Matachina dances because of their beauty and "the notion of dancing as a vow, 
as an act of dedication that makes us think about the motivation for dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma originally intended to bring both the Turquoise and Pumpkin versions to 
Los Angeles, but, she said, "the Pumpkin clan wanted to consult the 
astrological calendar and this couldn't be done until June. We simply couldn't 
hold the programming and budget that late on the chance that the signs would 
allow them to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla acknowledged that festival audiences may not get the message. "People 
will see us differently," he said, "will get different things from what we do." 
</P>

Center, UCLA.

Artist Forums Continue 
</P>
<P>
The festival today continues its daily artists' forums, which director Peter 
Sellars said were planned "to give artists a chance to meet each other and talk 
in the most interesting way." 
</P>
<P>
Each weekday morning throughout the festival, two or three different groups 
will gather at UCLA's Artists Village to discuss their cultures and the arts 
and its influence on their societies. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars presided over the first session Friday, which featured 17 members of 
the Woomera Mornington Island Culture Team, who shared their aboriginal names, 
demonstrated their namesake woomera weapon and talked of efforts to preserve 
their art in modern Australia. Also present were six members of New York's 
Wooster Group -- including its most famous member, Willem Dafoe -- who 
discussed their work and their interest in "appropriating" traditional dances 
for their own performances. 
</P>
<P>
'The Un-Festival' at MOCA 
</P>
<P>
In what organizers are calling a "reprieve" from L.A. Festival events, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art has planned The Un-Festival Friday through Sunday, 
featuring John Fleck, Weba Garretson and Harry Shearer and his Ad Hoc 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be much less serious theater than that presented in the festival," 
said MOCA spokeswoman Anna L. Graham, noting that emcee Fleck would give 
"biting social commentary" related to his National Endowment for the Arts grant 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, singer Garretson will perform her "From Across the Room" piece, 
and satirist Shearer will perform a selection of original songs based on news 
events ranging from the U.S. invasion of Panama to the death of Elvis Presley. 
Also included will be Shearer's new anti-censorship rap, "(If U Want Free 
Speech) Go to Russia." 
</P>
<P>
The Un-Festival is an independent MOCA production unrelated to the festival, 
but it is being held at the museum's Temporary Contemporary between two 
festival events -- presentations by New York's Wooster Group and Tijuana 
performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Performances will begin at 8 p.m., with a second performance on Saturday at 
10:30. Tickets are $15; $12 for MOCA members, senior citizens and students. 
Information: (213) 626-6828.

'MANA WAKA' A LONG-BURIED TALE OF NEW ZEALAND'S MAORI; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE DEPRESSION-ERA FILM, RESTORED BY DOCUMENTARIAN MERATA MITA, 
CHRONICLES THE BUILDING OF CEREMONIAL WAR CANOES. THE MAORI QUEEN WILL ATTEND 
TONIGHT'S SCREENING AT UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Documentarian Merata Mita, whose film, "Mana Waka" screens tonight at UCLA's 
Melnitz Theater, believes a movie buff of a higher order assisted her with her 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all shot on old 35mm nitrate film," said Mita, who needed to 
painstakingly assemble 20,000 feet shot in the late '30s. "The consensus was 
that given its condition, the film would have deteriorated, but it was actually 
all there -- intact. That we put down to the spiritual strength of the film." 
</P>
<P>
The title means "War Canoe," and is a celluloid testament to the will of New 
Zealand's Maori tribe. In 1937, Princess Te Puea Herangi endeavored to inspire 
her people during the Depression by commissioning the construction of seven 
majestic canoes. 
</P>
<P>
R.G.H. Manley's hand-held camera recorded the felling of the great trees that 
would eventually carry dozens of proud Maori across the waters. He captured the 
thousands of man-hours expended and the workers' frustration before Princess Te 
Puea's funds ran out. Only three vessels were completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't received well," said Mita. "And the government wouldn't support it. 
That's how the project fell by the wayside. It became the unfulfilled dream of 
the Maori people." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "Mana Waka" an event is the presence of the Maori queen, or Te 
Arikuni (the most high-born), and the elders during all screenings of the film. 
</P>
<P>
Before the lights go down, traditional ceremonies are held in which the 
audience participates. "They bless the audience," the director said, "and what 
happens during the ceremony is the people become part of the film and the film 
becomes part of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"To a lot of people (in the United States) that is unnatural, but it's not 
unnatural to our culture and the way we see things. Art is never disconnected 
from the people." 
</P>
<P>
Mita is known in her native land as an impassioned filmmaker. Two of her early 
efforts in the '80s, "Bastion Point: Day 507" and "Patul," were sharp 
commentaries on Maori injustice. Her reputation came in handy when trying to 
locate craftsmen who toiled long ago on the war canoes. She found three of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to have one of the three craftsmen sitting by us all the time, 
and they would fill us in on the unseen stories of the whole thing," Mita said. 
</P>
<P>
Te Puea died in the early '50s. The canoes, which each span more than 100 feet, 
are still used during ceremonies and to carry training crews.

PACIFICA PLAYERS AT AUTRY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an uneventful first half, which mostly failed to involve the listener, a 
woodwind quintet from Pacifica Chamber Players came to life, in an Open 
Festival concert at the Gene Autry Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
This apparently ad-hoc ensemble, whose members are Heather Lockwood (flute), 
Cheryl Foster (oboe), Frank Silva (clarinet), Edward Treuenfels (horn) and 
Charles Fernandez (bassoon), thereafter held its audience deftly, with strong 
-- if sometimes overstrident and usually overloud -- performances. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the quality of the works -- by Ingolf Dahl, Phyllis Addison, Dean 
Wheelock and quintet members Fernandez and Silva -- on this second half had a 
lot to do with the players' attentiveness, and with their audience's pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
But a high energy level was the catalyst for that pleasure. Engaging music 
sounds engaging only when performers take the trouble to project. 
</P>
<P>
What was most cherishable on this eclectic, mostly 20th-Century program Sunday 
night turned out to be Ingolf Dahl's brilliant "Allegro and Arioso" from 1942, 
a piece still fresh-sounding, witty and poignant. Coming immediately after 
intermission, it signaled the fact that the five performers had finally warmed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Addison's skillful and colorful "The Room," a series of emotionally resonant 
character-pieces, and Wheelock's jaunty "Rondo," also held our interest 
effortlessly. Fernandez's three "Songs From a Child's Point of View," 
handsomely sung by soprano Vanessa Vandergriff, proved charming but innocuous. 
Silva's brief, jazzy "Solar Blew" closed the program in a burst of energy. 
</P>
<P>
The low-key first half had been devoted to quintets by Franz Danzi and Irving 
Fine (an optimistic work from 1948) and shorter, more recent items by Jonathan 
Sacks and William Goldstein, worthy pieces all, but offered in passive, rather 
than vigorous, readings.

A POPULIST PARADE FROM THE PUPPETEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its band playing and leader Peter Schumann high on 20-foot stilts 
disguised as a tender angel of joy, the ubiquitous Bread and Puppet Theater 
marched its way through Chinatown in a Sunday parade that was part of the Moon 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
There was, alas, no adequate way to know this, unless you had psychic powers or 
simply stumbled on the event. Festival promotion indicated something by the 
Bread and Puppet at Olvera Street, but nothing that began blocks away at the 
Alpine Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the afternoon parade ended at the Olvera Street Plaza, where 
indeed the Bread and Puppet performed a 45-minute version of its annual 
Domestic Resurrection Circus, to the great glee of a packed audience. (This 
will be repeated at Reseda's San Julian Park at noon today.) 
</P>
<P>
The full-length Domestic Resurrection Circus, a two-day, noon-to-dusk event 
that draws as many as 20,000 people each August to a grassy 30-acre field 
adjacent to the Bread and Puppet farm in Glover, Vt., is a joyous one-ring 
celebration that pokes fun at whatever social, political, ecological or 
mythological issues strike the group's unfettered fancy. 
</P>
<P>
The condensed version of the Circus at Olvera Street delivered a tiger-taming 
act led by a 2-year-old (children are always an important part of all B&amp;P 
shows), a mini-parade of the work force and, in the turned-tables department, a 
group of dancing pigs serving a human head on a platter! 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of adult fairy tales, a roving frog-knight is corraled by 
concerned dwarfs (definitely not the Disney variety) to kiss their Sleeping 
Beauty. As thanks for his pains, the waking Beauty knocks out the poor frog, 
who remains out of it until a kiss from a passing Prince, in turn, wakens him. 
(He was expecting a princess maybe?) 
</P>
<P>
Such pure spoofing goes hand-in-glove with a skit that pits a villain, Cold 
War, against the knight Common Sense and makes mincemeat of Bush's 1989 
invasion of Panama, the Stealth bomber and the peace dividend. (It hasn't yet 
caught up with the invasion of Kuwait.) 
</P>
<P>
The public's favorite on Sunday was a sendup of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and 
the Rev. Donald Wildmon, there, they told us, to sniff out obscenity. Helms got 
arrested by his own art police when one of the tigers came up from the rear and 
ripped off his trousers. 
</P>
<P>
These skits are brisk, short, simple, benevolent and bracketed by bravura 
stunts or colorful Earth-preservational interludes. They are a true celebration 
of intelligent life and the dignity of all creatures, human and otherwise. 
These artists show impatience with silliness and evil, but never stoop to 
hostility, having no doubt discovered long ago that laughter is far more 
memorable than anger. 
</P>
<P>
This unique company from Vermont promises to be the connecting thread that will 
weave its magic all the way through the two-week L.A. Festival. Its first 
full-fledged, extended appearance in Los Angeles epitomizes festival director 
Peter Sellars' idea of art for the people and, where Bread and Puppet is 
concerned, as often as possible free to the people. 
</P>
<P>
Of the B&amp;P's many events, only "Metropolitan Indian Report" (which ended 
Monday) and "The Uprising of the Beast" (still to come) were/are ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
The others -- the pageants, parades and free shows in the parks that are among 
Schumann's favorite things to do because he too passionately believes in the 
idea of art for everyone -- are open to anybody who cares to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Finding out where and when hasn't always been easy, but help is on the way. 
Please note: 
</P>
<P>
 Today, noon, the Domestic Resurrection Circus, San Julian Park, Reseda -- 
free; Saturday and Sunday, noon, "The Same Boat," near the carousel at Griffith

U.S. SEIZES IRAQI SHIP; 
</P>
<P>
NO SHOTS FIRED AS VESSEL CARRYING TEA IS BOARDED

An armed boarding party from a U.S. destroyer in the Gulf of Oman seized an 
Iraqi cargo ship headed for Iraq with a load of tea today and steered it toward 
the Omani port of Muscat, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired and no resistance was offered, Pentagon spokesman Pete 
Williams said, in what is the first seizure in the U.S. intercept operation 
that began Aug. 17 to enforce the U.N. embargo against Iraqi goods. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the Iraqi-owned vessel, the Zanoobia, "reported it was bound for 
the Iraqi port of Basra with a cargo of tea when it was intercepted by the 
guided-missile destroyer USS Goldsborough" about 6:30 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to board the ship was made after it refused orders from the 
Goldsborough to either return to its port of origin or to divert to a non-Iraqi 
port," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"The team boarded the Zanoobia without meeting resistance and will stay aboard 
the ship until it reaches its new destination," he said, declining to identify 
the port where the ship was headed and where it originated. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense officials who asked not to be identified said that the ship 
had departed Sri Lanka, where it loaded up on tea, and that U.S. Navy and Coast 
Guard personnel were taking it to Oman's port of Muscat. 
</P>
<P>
At Port Newark, N.J., the Customs Service detained a Kuwaiti container ship and 
was examining the cargo today to see if anything was destined for Iraq, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship Al Wattyah was ordered held Monday evening, said Neil Pitagno, a 
Customs agent based in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
"The vessel has not been seized; it has been detained," Pitagno said. "There 
are a number of containers aboard that we are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has decided to ask Congress to forgive Egypt's entire $7-billion 
military debt because of its leadership in standing up to Iraqi aggression, the 
White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said forgiving the debt "recognizes the 
strategic importance of Egypt" in the multinational effort to enforce the trade 
embargo against Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a symbol of our appreciation" for the role played by Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Westerners trickled out of Iraq into Jordan today, and a convoy of 
foreigners set out into the scorching desert heat in an effort to go home. But 
hopes for any large-scale departure remained dim.

VICTIM, BENEFACTOR HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shooting victim and a good Samaritan who was driving him to the hospital were 
injured this morning when their car crashed in Mission Hills and flipped over, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting victim was then taken by ambulance to the Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center and was in stable condition after being treated for a gunshot 
wound to the chest and cuts and bruises from the car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the victim or the car's driver, who also suffered 
minor injuries in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Harvie Eubank said the incident began about 3:30 a.m. when a 24-year-old 
man pulled into a service station at Nordhoff Street and Sepulveda Boulevard 
and was confronted by a gunman who demanded money. When the motorist refused to 
turn over any money, he was shot and the gunman fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
The victim went into the service station and asked for help getting to a 
hospital. He said he did not want police called because he was wanted by 
authorities, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old customer who was in the store volunteered to drive the victim's 
car and take him to a hospital, police said. But as he drove the car onto a 
freeway on-ramp, the car swerved, hit a truck and then went off the road and 
flipped, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not yet determined if the shooting victim was being sought by 
authorities, Eubank said.

CHP ARRESTS 167 ON DUI CHARGES IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, armed with hand-held Breathalyzers and a tougher 
legal standard for drunkenness, arrested 167 people on suspicion of driving 
while under the influence of alcohol on Orange County freeways over Labor Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Three people involved in two traffic accidents related to drunk driving were 
killed on the county's freeways during the traditional final weekend of summer, 
the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Lyle Whitten said officers from the Westminster station arrested 59 
motorists on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is nearly double the number of arrests the Westminster station made 
last Labor Day, and the most arrests over a weekend in years, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed much of the increase in arrests to greater enforcement and a new 
law that allows police to arrest motorists found to have a blood-alcohol level 
of .08. 
</P>
<P>
The law that lowered the legal standard for drunkenness from .10 took effect on 
Jan. 1. Whitten said 9% of the arrests over Labor Day weekend involved people 
who could have passed the old test. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have driven away last year," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten also said, however, that it appears more people are drinking and 
driving, despite heavy advertising campaigns aimed at discouraging the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Drunks are out there killing innocent people," Whitten said. "That's the 
reason we are putting so much emphasis on drunk driving. (But) you'd think DUI 
would be reduced, not increased, because of enhanced enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Ken Daily said officers stationed in the San Juan Capistrano office 
made 45 DUI arrests. That figure was up from 25 arrests the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
And CHP Officer Angel Johnson said the Santa Ana office arrested 63 motorists 
for suspected DUI. That figure was five fewer than last year.

The pilot of the first aircraft to cross the country using sunshine for power 
today called off his attempt to complete the last 8 miles of the trip to an 
airstrip near the Wright Brothers Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Northeast winds in excess of 20 m.p.h. forced Eric Raymond to cancel plans to 
fly the remaining miles from a turf farm, where he landed on Monday, to the 
First Flight Airport adjacent to the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing his plans, Raymond and his wife, Aida, went windsurfing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really windy. The weather forecast is to be this way tomorrow. He made it 
to the coast," said Nancy McWilliams of Kitty Hawk Kites, which has been the 
headquarters for the final portion of the trip. "Tomorrow, he'll set up the 
plane for anybody who wants to see it and then head home to California." 
</P>

Eric Raymond first took off July 16 from Desert Center, Calif., about 200 miles 
east of Los Angeles.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program is "on the brink of collapse," 
a leader of the Communist Party's traditionalist wing told 2,500 delegates at a 
Russian party congress in the Kremlin today. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan K. Polozkov, first secretary of the Communist Party in the Russian 
Republic, drew vigorous applause from the delegates, a group that includes many 
generals and career party officials who are believed to harbor reservations 
about Gorbachev's policies. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev sat on the podium at the front of the hall, remaining virtually 
silent through a day of speeches that often contained scathing criticism of his 
leadership, though without mentioning him by name. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the day's strongest applause went to Ivan Vtorushin, a worker from the 
Siberian city of Tyumen who called for "returning the nation to 1985," the year 
in which Gorbachev assumed power. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what slogans are used, a policy resulting in falling living 
standards and bloodshed is against popular interests," Vtorushin said, 
referring to the Soviet Union's accelerating economic problems and ethnic 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates are meeting this week to complete the process of creating a 
separate Russian branch of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In his hourlong keynote address, Polozkov urged delegates to counter the 
"deliberate discrediting of the Communist Party and the socialist choice as a 
whole." 
</P>
<P>
He said the country's economic crisis, caused by the Soviet people's 
psychological unpreparedness for a market-based system, "is, in the final 
analysis, putting perestroika on the brink of collapse."

Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter today received the highest rating from

</P>
<P>
Souter received a unanimous "well-qualified" rating from the ABA's Standing 
Committee on Federal Judiciary, according to a letter from the panel to the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
Souter, a former member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, was nominated by 
President Bush in July for the vacancy created by the retirement of Associate 
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Souter received a similar "well-qualified" rating earlier this year when he was

Nearly half the residents of the state that was home to the "Massachusetts 
miracle" would consider moving out if the economy worsens, a poll indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Of 436 voters polled last month, 50% said they would not consider leaving if 
the economy worsens, 47% said they would and 3% said they do not know. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of those polled said they are cutting back on groceries because of 
the economy, and 30% said they worry about losing their jobs. Most of the 
latter group were young, 18 to 39, and middle-income -- $30,000 to $60,000 a 
year; they were also chief among those saying they would consider moving. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 61% believe that the economy will get worse during the 
next six months, and 42% blame state policy-makers for the state of the 
economy.

Electronic Data Systems Corp. and the billionaire Pritzker family of Chicago 
plan to acquire a California holding company that owns one of the nation's 
largest title insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
In a deal announced today, EDS reached agreement with the Pritzker affiliate 
New Century Enterprises Inc. to acquire Westwood Equities Corp., owner of the 
Ticor Title Insurance Cos. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Ticor Title has been hurt heavily by real estate problems associated with the 
savings and loan crisis. Ticor Title had been the nation's largest title 
insurance firm, but lost that ranking in the wake of its financial 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood's sales are estimated at $549 million by the 1990 Standard and Poor's 
Register, down from $627 million the previous year. Ticor Title accounts for 
almost 90% of Westwood's employment. 
</P>
<P>
The holding company was not profitable in either 1988 or 1989, Westwood 
Executive Vice President Erich Everbach said. In 1988, Westwood liquidated a 
mortgage insurance unit that had become insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood also owns Ticor Realty Tax Services, the nation's second-largest 
provider of tax-reporting services on mortgaged property. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood and both Ticor companies have headquarters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under a separate agreement announced today, EDS will furnish all information 
technology services to Westwood's corporate and operating subsidiaries, the 
announcement said.

Malaysia has voted to oppose any attempt to bar Iraq from the Asian Games, 
South Korea will avoid the issue and China is still mulling its decision, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries have threatened to boycott the games if Iraq competes, 
an official of the Olympic Council of Asia said last week. 
</P>
<P>
But Hamzah Abu Samah, president of the Olympic Council of Malaysia, said 
politics should not be allowed to interfere with the games. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council ordered a worldwide trade embargo on Iraq after its 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 38 OCA members were asked to vote on extending the U.N. 
sanctions to include the Sept. 22-Oct. 7 Asian Games. The vote is to be 
completed by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean sports officials said their country will abstain from voting, 
although Seoul is observing the U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese organizers have been haggling over which team to recognize if two 
Kuwaiti teams attend, the one representing the Iraqi-installed government or 
one representing the Saudi Arabia-based government in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Many Kuwaiti athletes were out of the country at the time of the invasion and 
the government-in-exile's ability to field and fund a team is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The government-in-exile also did not submit a final list of participants by an 
Aug. 22 deadline, but it did send a telex from Saudi Arabia recently, 
indicating it would enter five events. 
</P>
<P>
By today, China said it had received entry lists from 31 countries totaling 
4,306 athletes. Yemen, Palestine and Kuwait are among the seven countries or 
regions that have yet to submit their lists.

international sports, Juan Antonio Samaranch said at the opening ceremony of 
the fourth International Conference Against Apartheid in Sport. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been banned from the Olympics since 1970 because of its 
apartheid policy of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 1992 is too early, but if they solve the problems it's possible," 
Samaranch said. "Something important is happening for the first time in South 
Africa. We hope it's the beginning of the end (of apartheid)." 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said that the solution to the problem must originate within Africa 
and that the IOC would not move to end South Africa's isolation from 
international sports until black African sports leaders approve. 
</P>
<P>
The freeing of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and other moves 
by the South African government led to talks about the country's possible 
readmission to the Olympic movement.

YANKEES EXECUTIVE SUES BASEBALL COMMISSIONER

Baseball was dragged into the federal courts again Tuesday when a New York 
Yankees executive sued Fay Vincent and accused the commissioner of trying to 
run him and George Steinbrenner out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard L. Kleinman, executive vice president and chief operating executive of 
the Yankees, made the allegation in a $22-million lawsuit against Vincent and 
John M. Dowd, the commissioner's special counsel who directed an investigation 
of Steinbrenner's dealings with gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman accused Vincent of framing him and Steinbrenner on charges they acted 
against the best interests of baseball and of covering up ex-Yankees outfielder 
Dave Winfield's involvement with Spira. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit in Manhattan's federal court seeks to stop Vincent from holding a 
hearing Thursday to determine possible disciplinary action against Kleinman. 
U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand will hear arguments Wednesday on Kleinman's 
request for a temporary restraining order to block Vincent's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Vincent's course of conduct from the very beginning of his involvement in this 
matter demonstrates that he has harbored a prejudice against Kleinman and 
Steinbrenner and a desire to find a way to exclude them from being involved 
with the Yankees," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Levin, Vincent's spokesman, did not have an immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner agreed to resign as the Yankees general partner after Vincent 
ruled acted against the best interests of baseball by associating with Spira 
and paying him $40,000. Two Yankees limited partners sued in Cleveland to keep 
Steinbrenner in control, but a judge turned down their request for a temporary 
restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
Spira claimed Kleinman arranged a money-market account for him at the time he 
was paid last January. That is one of the matters Vincent wants to discuss at 
his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The initiation of the charges against Kleinman," the lawsuit said, "was done 
in bad faith with the intent to undermine his contract with the Yankees and to 
prevent him from succeeding Steinbrenner as the managing general partner of the 
Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged that Vincent and Dowd conducted an unfair and biased 
investigation and that Dowd tampered with transcripts of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman said he will not be allowed to call witnesses at the disciplinary 
hearing to support his position. He also said that Vincent has refused to hold 
the hearing in public. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner picked Kleinman to be general partner after Steinbrenner's son, 
Hank, declined to take the job. But Vincent said Kleinman could not take the 
position because of the pending charges and Steinbrenner then chose Robert E. 
Nederlander, a Yankees limited partner. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman accused Vincent of using the Spira incident as an excuse for bring 
charges against him and Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
"The contacts between Spira and the Yankees were known for years," the lawsuit 
said. "Despite this knowledge, Vincent charged Steinbrenner and Kleinman with 
misconduct in having these contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Spira is awaiting trial on an eight-count indictment that charges him with 
trying to extort $150,000 from Steinbrenner and with threatening to harm 
Steinbrenner and ex-Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Spira, who said he worked in public relations for the David M. Winfield 
Foundation for underprivileged youths, claims he gave Steinbrenner damaging 
information about both Winfield and the foundation.

Carl Lewis is no longer banned from competing in Japanese track meets, sponsors 
for an upcoming meet said today. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the world record holder in the 100-meter dash who won four gold medals 
in the 1984 Olympics and two golds in the 1988 games, will race in the Toto 
Super 90 track meet Sept. 15, the meet's organizing committee announced. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Lewis' first race in Japan since May 14, 1989, when the Japan 
Amateur Athletic Federation accused him of covering up a sponsor's name on the 
number card on the back of his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
After the meet, the federation lodged a "strong complaint" with its American 
counterpart and informed Lewis that he would not be invited back except as part 
of a U.S. international team. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Lewis and the federation seem to have worked all that out," said an 
organizing committee member who requested anonymity. "With the world 
championships to be held in Tokyo (next year), I think they decided they had no 
choice."

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: 'THE COP' WALKS A BEAT WITH NEWSPAPER HANDICAPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As long as the "The Cop" keeps working nights as a security guard at huge 
housing developments in the north end of the San Fernando Valley, he will 
continue to sleep through the mornings and drive to the Southland tracks in the 
afternoons. And since he is not a good handicapper, he takes his betting 
selections from the local newspapers, the Los Angeles Times' "Consensus" box in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
The Cop believes that because the newspaper handicappers get paid to pick the 
horses, they should end up with more winners than does the betting public. He 
has found, however, that handicappers mostly run hot and cold, averaging only 
28.2% in wins over the years, and the trick is to latch onto one when he is 
going good and coming up with lots of winners. 
</P>
<P>
The Cop, therefore, generally takes a running average of the handicapper's wins 
for his last five days and then uses the selections of the one with the best 
average. But instead of betting $2 a race, The Cop begins with $2 and wagers 
double the sum of all previous bets, win or lose, for four straight races: 
$2-4-12-36. 
</P>
<P>
For the day's nine races, The Cop needs a total of $74. And he tells his 
cronies in the Grandstand at Hollywood Park that if he loses, he'll generally 
make up more than his losses on days when he wins. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22 at Hollywood Park, The Cop started to bet Bob Mieszerski's 
selections from the "Hollywood Park Consensus" box. He bet $2 in the first race 
of the day on Superbe King, who finished sixth, and followed it up with a $4 
wager on Dr. Hart in the second. Dr. Hart ended up third. 
</P>
<P>
Behind $6, The Cop bet $12 on Sonata Slew in the third race, 1 1/8 miles on the 
turf for fillies and mares 4 years old and up. Sonata Slew started off sixth in 
a seven-horse field, moved up to fifth at the quarter pole and started to move 
going around the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
She just managed to take over first by a nose at the finish. On a $5.40 mutuel, 
The Cop received $32.40, showing a profit of $20.40 on the race and a gain of 
$14.40 for the first three races. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth race, The Cop wagered $36 on Mieszerski's choice of Quick Step 
Slewpy, who was running seven furlongs against five other fillies and mares 3 
years old and up. Breaking from the outside post position, Quick Step Slewpy 
settled into second behind the leader, who faded entering the stretch. In the 
stretch, Quick Step Slewpy took a half-length lead and then drew away from the 
other nags to win by 3 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The Cop won $93.60 on the race, as Quick Step Slewpy paid $7.20 and returned 
$129.60. After the fourth race, The Cop was ahead $108 for the day, which was 
cut to $106 when Mieszerski's choice of Ask the Man ran fourth in the next 
race. But then Midnight Interlude won by 2 3/4 lengths in the sixth and paid 
$7.80. The Cop won $11.60 on the race and found himself ahead $117.60. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing with the system, The Cop bet $12 on the seventh race, putting his 
money down on Tight Spot, which was going off a $2.60-$1 favorite. Tight Spot 
immediately went for the lead in the 1 1/16-mile race on the turf for 
3-year-olds and drew out by 1 1/2 lengths entering the stretch. As the other 
horses tired, Tight Spot continued to run strongly, winning by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
With Tight Spot paying $7.20, The Cop received $43.20, adding $31.20 to his 
gains and showing a profit of $148.80 for the day. But since the second 
favorite, Black Jack Road, in the eighth couldn't manage better than fourth, 
The Cop blew $36 and cut his winnings to $112.80. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth race, Mieszerski had chosen Manzanita, which won easily by 2 3/4 
lengths over 1 1/16 miles for fillies and mares 4 years old and up. As the 
favorite, the nag paid $6.20 and gave The Cop a $4.20 gain for his $2 wagered. 
For the nine races, The Cop had won $117. 
</P>
<P>
Another winning session for The Cop turned out to be June 28, when Pat Ray of 
The Times came up with five winners. Wildly Irish, a favorite, lost the first 
race, but Speaking Part romped home a winner in the second race by 
three-quarters of a length. Speaking Part, a long shot, paid $32.40, and The 
Cop received $64.80, giving him a two-race profit of $58.80. 
</P>
<P>
Ray had picked Intrepidness in the third, a six-furlong race for 3-year-olds. 
The horse took the lead entering the stretch and continued on to a two-length 
victory, paying a $10.40 mutuel. For his $12 wager, The Cop received $62.40, 
adding $50.40 to his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Quite Regal gave The Cop his third consecutive win in the fourth, when the 
horse took the lead at the three-quarter mark of a 1 1/16-mile race for fillies 
and mares 3 years old and up. Quite Regal opened up four lengths in the stretch 
and extended her margin to 6 1/2 lengths at the finish. The win was worth a 
profit of $46.80, and The Cop was up $156 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
After a loss in the fifth race, Ray's choice of Free Love easily won the sixth. 
Orrefor lost the seventh race, leaving The Cop ahead $148.80. In the eighth, 
Ray's pick, Flirty, running as an entry with Past Remembered, was backed down 
as the $1.30-$1 favorite. She went wire to wire in an eight-horse field, won by 
a neck over Past Remembered and paid $4.60 to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Cop received $82.80 for his $36 wagered and pocketed $46.80 on the race. 
After losing $2 on a long shot, Excellentperformer, in the ninth, The Cop left 
the track with total winnings of $193.60. 
</P>
<P>
The Cop compares his system to his nighttime work as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the darkness as one strolls the grounds among the unfinished houses, 
and there's the darkness when one decides on which handicapper to use," he 
said. "However, when work is over, the dawn brings the light. And after one 
ends up with a profit at the track, it seems that the light has always been 
there. It's just a matter of finding it."

God ought to be a black Briton, according to the actors' union Equity. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said Equity had asked the producers of "The Children of Eden" -- 
a new musical based on Old Testament stories -- to prove they had tried to find 
a British actor before approving their choice of American actor Ken Page. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they can't find a black actor in this country good enough to play God 
but we find that hard to believe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the union had not rejected the application but was following 
procedures laid down to protect British acting jobs. "This has got nothing to 
do with 'Miss Saigon'," she said. British Equity was highly critical of the 
American actors' union during a row over "Miss Saigon" that has jeopardized the 
planned Broadway opening of the British hit musical next year. 
</P>
<P>
American Equity banned a Briton from playing the male lead, a Eurasian pimp, 
saying it should go to an Asian. It changed its mind after British producer 
Cameron Mackintosh canceled the run and it is not known if the show, which 
notched up $25 million in advance ticket sales, will go ahead in New York.

Opening night for the San Francisco Opera season may be canceled unless opera 
management makes another offer today to musicians after a contract rejection. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians union Monday rejected a contract offer, and it may receive a 
strike sanction today from the San Francisco Labor Council. 
</P>
<P>
Opera management was expected to announce this afternoon whether it will make 
another offer. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's last contract expired Aug. 19, and its 69 members voted to 
continue rehearsing without a contract for the coming season, which begins 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians Local 6 asked for a 22.5% raise over three years, which would bring 
the musicians' salaries to $49,000, said Lisa Hirsch Du Brul, negotiator and 
legal counsel for the union. The latest contract, which ran from 1987 to 1990, 
brought salaries from $30,000 to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the opera orchestra played all its preseason rehearsals without a 
contract, voting on the final deal 10 minutes before the dress rehearsal of 
"The Barber of Seville," which was performed the night before the season 
opening.

Mikhail Gorbachev has been a lead player on the stage of history for years, so 
maybe it's appropriate that he will soon be portrayed on a real stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow Gold," opening in London later this month, will bring to theater 
audiences an array of Communist giants, from Lenin to the present-day Soviet 
president, to be played by David Calder. 
</P>
<P>
The play was written by London playwrights Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali, who 
were responsible for last year's "Iranian Nights," about the plight of author 
Salman Rushdie under Muslim death threats. 
</P>
<P>
Calder says the play treats Gorbachev as someone on whom "the fickle finger of 
historical fate suddenly lands, rather than a man of ambition desperate to get 
into the old Lenin seat." 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow Gold" opens Sept. 26 at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Barbican 
Theater. It runs through Nov. 3.

Country music singer Tammy Wynette just happened to spend the night in a motel 
where police had a standoff with an armed man who barricaded himself in his 
room for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Customers in nearby rooms were evacuated and there were no injuries, Police 
Chief James Bozicevich said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was alone in the room, surrendered after authorities broke a 
window early Monday and tossed in two tear gas canisters, Bozicevich said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wynette nor any member of her crew was associated with the man or the 
incident, Bozicevich said. The chief said Wynette was staying in a part of the 
motel that was not evacuated. She was in the Iron Range area of northern 
Minnesota to perform at Ironworld USA in nearby Chisholm. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said someone reported late Sunday that the man had pointed a gun at 
someone. No shots were fired, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
The man from Mayfield, Ky., had more than one gun in his possession when he 
surrendered, he said.

Airplane food may be a self-canceling phrase, but it's not as if things in the 
terminal are a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
How many of us have muttered softly to ourselves about the food in airport 
cafeterias, picking listlessly at a dried-out piece of chicken while chewing on 
a cherry tomato that couldn't be speared with a fork. 
</P>
<P>
Now, somebody is trying to change all that. The nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the great airport foods of the world -- the barbecued beef of Memphis, 
the chili crab at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok and the beluga caviar of Maxim's 
at Charles de Gaulle in Paris -- a regional emphasis is the foundation of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Host International Food and Beverage Services, the same people who have already 
brought you that success fou, the Japanese noodle bar at L.A. International 
Airport (and a good deal of that dried-out chicken), is in a regional mood 
again. The new Thomas F. Riley Terminal will be their latest experiment. 
</P>
<P>
There, at Orange Grill, a 177-seat restaurant that will be the centerpiece of 
the terminal's atrium, they plan to offer California/Mexican cuisine in a 
casual atmosphere. According to Bruce Fish, Host International's general 
manager at John Wayne, the menu at the restaurant will feature, among other 
things, quesadillas, soft tacos, tostadas, grilled sandwiches and oversize 
salads. The prices will be moderate, with almost everything ranging from $5 to 
$8. 
</P>
<P>
The atrium itself will contain a Food Court, in case Cal-Mex cooking is not 
your style. There, you will find TCBY (the audacious acronym for "the country's 
best yogurt"), Pizza Hut and something they call the "personal pan pizza" (in a 
cardboard box that bore a striking resemblance in texture to what was inside 
the last time I tasted it), Fresh Bakery, a Host International operation 
serving cold sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies and the like, and an outfit 
called Creative Croissants, which will hopefully do its part to stop those 
uncalled for comparisons about airport croissants and the padding in Italian 
shoes.

More conventional travelers and kids, no doubt, will be happy to know that two 
McDonald's restaurants will be opened in the gate areas. Apparently, Orange 
County-based Carl's Jr. was in contention for the spots, but McDonald's got the 
franchises. Essentially, that means happy meals instead of happy stars. I'm not 
sure what else. 
</P>
<P>
All of this sounds shopping mall-ish to me, but then, that's life here in 
Orange County.

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
BIG, SMALL PLANES SEEK AIRTIGHT SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A small, two-seat Cessna 152 maintained a cautious distance behind an imposing 
Boeing 757 as both planes waited to take off recently at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lurking behind the Cessna was another commercial airliner, followed by a 
four-engine British Aerospace jetliner. Nearby, a tiny Piper and a 
sleek-looking Gulfstream business jet also were lined up on the taxiway. 
</P>
<P>
Bright landing lights from another commercial airliner could be seen 
approaching through the mid-morning haze, while small, private planes circled 
around, accomplishing "touch and goes" on a shorter, parallel runway. The 
difference in landing speeds between the airliner and the smaller planes was 
noticeable, maybe as great as 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the frenetic pace at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
With 530,000 operations a year, it is the fifth busiest airport in the United 
States in takeoffs and landings. Those topping John Wayne -- Chicago O'Hare, 
Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas/Ft. Worth -- handle commercial airline flights 
almost exclusively and provide minimum services for smaller, general-aviation 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
But about 80% of the 1,200 to 2,000 daily takeoffs and landings at John Wayne 
are general aviation, everything from the small Cessna 152 to a big, sleek 
Gulfstream jet. Pilots flying into the busy airport range from four-stripe 
commercial airline captains to student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Michael C. Church, owner of Sunrise Aviation at the airport and an officer of 
the Orange County Airport Assn., called John Wayne the "largest mixed-use" 
airport of its kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Big commercial and small private planes sharing the same turf have always 
raised a number of safety concerns. With the $310-million airport expansion 
project almost complete and the number of commercial passengers increasing, 
concerns have intensified. 
</P>
<P>
But both airport critics and boosters agree that general aviation will stay at 
John Wayne because of politically influential private pilots' groups and the 
support of airport management, the Orange County Airport Commission and the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no written policy on the matter," said Christine Edwards, chief of 
airport operations and facilities and a private pilot herself. "But the 
unwritten policy is that the county has always planned to keep the current 
level of general aviation services at John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
There have been increased efforts lately toward peaceful coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of near collisions in the air have declined at John Wayne, since 
January when the Federal Aviation Administration created a new safety zone, 
said Bob Nietzel, an FAA quality assurance specialist. At certain altitudes 
within that zone, general aviation pilots must be in radio contact with air 
traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we know where everyone is," Nietzel said. "It's safer." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the general aviation facilities moved across the field to the airport's 
west side with the construction of the Thomas F. Riley Terminal, creating an 
aircraft ground traffic pattern some pilots said causes dangerous 
"crisscrossing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a bad physical layout and the new terminal locks this in for many 
years," said Bob McGowan, a veteran pilot for a large airline, who lives in 
Villa Park. "It's just a little postage stamp airport much like Midway in 
Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Planes landing on the smaller, general aviation runway cross the larger runway 
used by commercial airliners to refuel or tie down their planes. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say (crossing runways) is no worse than any other airport with 
parallel runways," said airport operations chief Edwards. "The ideal situation 
would have been for us to flip-flop the runways or build the terminal on the 
other side of the airport, but we didn't have enough land to accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
A new taxiway scheduled to open Sept. 16 "will separate the larger and smaller 
planes taxiing or waiting to take off," said Joe B. Fowler, air traffic manager 
at the John Wayne control tower. "The smaller planes will not have to wait 
behind the larger ones, avoiding concerns from pilots of smaller planes about 
the 'wash' (exhaust) from the bigger jets." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the new taxiway should also shorten the wait for departing 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Many aviators predict that the number of smaller planes using John Wayne will 
decrease as the number of commercial flights increases. The exodus, they say, 
will be prompted by increased costs as well as a desire by some pilots to avoid 
heavy traffic and sharing space with big commercial jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in recent history, the demand for outdoor general aircraft 
parking slots at John Wayne has slackened. The waiting list, Edwards said, was 
once five years. But recent policy changes and increases in airport rent -- 
from $40 to $100 a month -- have discouraged some private aircraft owners. 
</P>
<P>
The safety zone has complicated flying in and out of John Wayne, among the 
Southland's largest general aviation facilities. Such regulations drive private 
pilots to airports with fewer restrictions, said Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Assn. representative Rol Murrow. Other pilots, he said, "move out because they 
find the atmosphere at John Wayne less friendly." 
</P>
<P>
There is only one other non-military airport in Orange County, the busy 
Fullerton airport, and few airfields outside the county for private pilots to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
A few general-aviation organizations -- including the AOPA -- emphasize that 
94% of all general aviation is for training or transferring pilots and 
passengers from one point to another for business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few joy riders out there any more," said the AOPA's Patricia 
Weil. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe John Wayne was a good general-aviation airport," said private pilot 
and retired commercial airline captain Richard D. Russell of Los Angeles, "and 
should have stayed that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY'S CROWDED AIRSPACE 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport is the fifth busiest airport in the U.S. in terms of 
takeoffs and landings. The ratio of private planes to commerrcial planes is 
about 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. Jetliners have two main approaches. Jetliners from norty and south turn and 
cross the coast near Huntington Beach Pier and descend toward Santa Ana/Tustin. 
Airlines from east cross into the county over Santa Ana Canyon. Altitude: 5,000 
ft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Planes from both approaches then turn at the same point to become parallel 
with Costa Mesa (55) Freeway. Altitude: 4,000 ft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. Final descent to John Wayne parallels Costa Mesa (55) Freeway. Light planes 
occasionally cross glide path in front of jetliners. Altitude: 2,000 ft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small general aviation planes are allowed to fly over most of Orange County, 
but at certain locations they are confined to specific altitudes. For example, 
small planes are supposed to stay below 2,000 feet or above 4,400 feet over the 
city of Orange to avoid airliners in the same area that are descending toward 
John Wayne Airport. Also, new regulations require private pilots to be in radio 
contact with air traffic controllers within a 5-mile radius of the airport.

RILEY TERMINAL MAKES GETTING ON, OFF PLANES AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Leon Whiteson, a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles, 
writes frequently about architecture for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The style of most modern airport terminals follows three very different models. 
</P>
<P>
Terminals are designed either as dramatic expressions of the symbolism of 
flight, as variations of regional shopping malls or as plane-oriented versions 
of the railroad terminuses that served the golden age of trains. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture of the new, $62-million Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne 
Airport falls into the third category. A barrel-vaulted passenger hall a 
quarter-mile long, the terminal is an efficient, workaday plane shed that aims 
at making getting on or off an aircraft as simple as boarding an Amtrak car. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the heart-in-throat symbolism of architect Eero Saarinen's 1962 
launching eagle design for the TWA terminal at New York's Kennedy 
International, the Riley terminal is thoroughly earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the new Delta Air Lines terminal at L.A. International Airport, 
whose ambience resembles an upscale shopping plaza, Riley is no Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to designer Helmut Jahn's spectacular, railroad terminal-inspired 1989 
design for United Airlines at Chicago O'Hare aiport, Riley is bare-bones 
utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
Long and low, its curved, gold-tinted aluminum roof glinting in the sun, the 
airport building creates an easy transition between cars and planes without 
overplaying its sense of occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"John Wayne is overwhelmingly a commuter airport," said principal designer Ed 
Friedrichs, a partner in the Los Angeles branch of San Francisco-based Gensler 
&amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrichs stressed that "in a commuter airport -- as against a major hub 
building where passengers wait to change planes or check in for long-distance 
flights -- convenience is the overriding concern. A commuter terminal has to be 
simple to check into, to pick up your bags or find your way directly to your 
plane. Anything that impedes that quick transition between the air and the 
ground is an irritation." 
</P>
<P>
Gensler &amp; Associates is part of a team that won a design competition for 
the new terminal held by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. The team 
includes the Irvine-based firm of Leason Pomeroy Associates (LPA Inc.) and New 
York-based Thompson Consultants International. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Gensler &amp; Associates have become one of the nation's 
leading airport architects. The firm's projects include the award-winning Delta 
Air Lines terminal at L.A. International and proposals for airport buildings at 
Palm Springs; Sioux Falls, S.D.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Detroit and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
LPA Inc. is a medium-sized firm with a diversity of projects ranging from the 
commercial to the educational. The firm has specialized in the design of 
low-rise, tilt-up office buildings of the kind that occupy much of Irvine's 
Spectrum 3 district, and has also collaborated with famed Mexican architect 
Ricardo Legoretta in the design of the new Tustin MarketPlace shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Airports have grown huge as the amount of air travel in the U.S. has expanded 
exponentially," said LPA Inc.'s Leason Pomeroy, who added that at 337,900 
square feet, the new terminal is more than 12 times the size of the old one 
that was designed by William Periera and built 23 years ago. "And that may 
already be too small a capacity to serve Orange County's explosive growth.". 
</P>
<P>
The Riley terminal's plan is splendidly straightforward. It divides 
symmetrically in two, both horizontally and vertically. 
</P>
<P>
In the horizontal separation, departing passengers drive to the upper level's 
multiple front doors, buy a ticket and walk a few yards to the concourse, from 
where they can see their waiting plane. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving passengers come into the concourse and can immediately look over a 
mezzanine to see the baggage claim area below, to check if their luggage has 
yet been deplaned. Stairs and escalators take them down to the ground floor to 
collect their bags and pick up their cars, get a bus, hail a taxi or board the 
monorail now under construction that will carry them over MacArthur Boulevard 
into Irvine's business district. 
</P>
<P>
A central, two-story glazed lobby, shaped like a square rotated through 45 
degrees, breaks up the long concourse vistas that might have overwhelmed the 
eye. The lobby houses a few token "embalmed" palms preserved in formaldehyde, 
and the famous statue of John Wayne moved from its place in front of the old 
Edward J. "Eddie" Martin Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The only real extravagance in the Riley design is in the amplitude of its 
barrel-vaulted ceilings, which trap huge volumes of air under their 65-foot, 
two-story height. This trapped air creates a generous space for passengers to 
catch their breath before taking off or rejoining the earthbound populace. 
</P>
<P>
The vaults are the main feature of the airport's architecture. Arranged in 
triple arches that run the 14-gate length of the concourse, the ribbed and 
rounded underbellies of the vaults are designed to resemble the fuselage of a 
jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
21 The vaults are varied in height and width to break up the terminal's long 
profile, which is visible not only from the adjacent boulevard but from the 
network of streets and freeways feeding the commercial developments surrounding 
the air field. 
</P>
<P>
The large-scale transportation network serving the terminal is the source of 
the design's one major visual and aesthetic failure -- the blanking out of the 
building's entire street-front facade by elevated concrete roadways. 
</P>
<P>
These massive roadways diminish the presence of the new terminal, so that from 
MacArthur Boulevard it seems little more than a half-hidden backdrop to a 
series of freeway-style ramps and loop roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Riley's architects, whose authority did not extend beyond the terminal 
itself, can't really be blamed for this failure, though they might have found a 
way to play down the ugly impact of the roadways by somehow integrating them 
into the building envelope. Alternately, there should have been a closer design 
collaboration between the airport architects and the roadway system engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of design coordination is also visible in such crude details as the 
junction of the edges of the elevated roadway where it bumps up against the 
building. Here, rough concrete curves slide past smooth marble rectangles in a 
clear clash of styles. 
</P>
<P>
Within the terminal, finishes and details have been kept basic. Gray carpet 
covers most of the floor and painted plaster covers the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The only luxury is the use of a beige German marble rich in fossils for floor 
areas that carry heavy traffic, and for some of the internal columns and 
external walls. Budget cuts, which forced the elimination of an elaborate 
surface finish proposed for the underside of the barrel vaults, have bared the 
arches' crude perforated metal ceiling panels. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly uncomfortable slope in the middle of the upper floor is caused by 
the difference in levels mandated by the height of the gates on the Tarmac side 
and by the clearance needed for buses arriving at ground level under the 
roadway on the street side. 
</P>
<P>
Since these heights were fixed by, on the one hand, Federal Air Administration 
regulations, and on the other by the county's Department of Transportation, the 
architects had no option other than inclining the floor to link the levels. 
</P>
<P>
Minor design faults that are the architects' responsibility show up in several 
places. 
</P>
<P>
The entry portals, framed in marble, look incongruous and clumsy in contrast to 
the sleek curves of the aluminum roofs. And the angular shapes of the central 
"host concourse" beside the lobby, which houses an airline club, are awkwardly 
fitted into the rectangular volumes of the main concourse. 
</P>
<P>
A design plus is that security -- a real concern in this era of airliner 
hijacking -- is gracefully handled by tempered glass screens. The screens 
separate people who have passed through the checkpoints from those who have 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Terminal lighting is also graceful. Large sconces throw a soft, 
computer-controlled glow upon the curving concourse ceiling. Externally, light 
poles illuminate the Tarmac side of the terminal, creating a pleasant panorama 
for arriving passengers and passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The architects have made a cheerful spectacle of the baggage carousels that 
deliver luggage to anxious travelers, many of whom secretly suspect they might 
never again see their suitcases. Shaped like giant metallic silver spider legs, 
the carousels occupy an open, airy space that allows the waiting passenger to 
be distracted by the terminal's busy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
According to a published report by Gensler &amp; Associates, an airport "should 
leave visitors with a distinct and indelibly positive first impression as to 
who and what their city is." 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne's Thomas F. Riley Terminal, despite some design flaws, does this 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture matches the ambience of central Orange County by creating the 
feeling that one is entering a vigorous, unpretentious, optimistic and 
essentially suburban scene that has plenty of light and air to spare.

<P>
If in your wanderings around John Wayne Airport you get the feeling you're 
being watched, don't feel paranoid. You are. 
</P>
<P>
The extra eyes are part of a sophisticated system that allows security to keep 
track not only of passengers and others temporarily in the airport but 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Look up on nearly any large wall in the terminal and you'll see video cameras 
recording the scene below. Multi-lens cameras, similar to those that peer down 
on the gambling tables in Las Vegas casinos, hang from the ceiling of the 
baggage claim area. And closed-circuit cameras are positioned in the parking 
garages and on the airfield itself. 
</P>
<P>
The images they record are seen on monitors in the central control room. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most sophisticated parts of the system keeps track of the comings 
and goings of airport employees. Each employee is issued an identification card 
with a magnetic stripe, similar to the one on a bank ATM card, that is 
electronically encoded uniquely for them. To go through any door that leads to 
a "sterile" area (any area on the airplane side of the passenger security 
checkpoints), employees must insert the card into a slot, where it is read 
electronically and compared to data in a central computer. 
</P>
<P>
The computer will unlock the door only to authorized employees. Others will be 
greeted with an alarm that automatically alerts security. Closed-circuit 
cameras will track unauthorized people throughout the airport, and the time of 
the attempted entry at each door is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers going to their planes walk through metal detectors. There are six of 
them on either side of the second-floor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a security glitch: Two stairways were designed for passengers 
going down from the second level to the baggage carousel. If a person were to 
try to ascend those stairs, it would mean entering the "sterile" side of the 
security checkpoints, bypassing the metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
Here is where a bit of irony overtakes the highly sophisticated security 
system: Officials abandoned the high-tech approach in favor of a human 
solution. Security guards posted at the top of each staircase will turn away 
anyone climbing up those stairs.

So what's it worth, being near an airport? 
</P>
<P>
A lot, says Robert Young, president of McDonnell Douglas Realty, the 
Irvine-based commercial and industrial development arm of McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started our projects in Orange County roughly 15 years ago, we had a 
small, almost rural, airport and we were doing two-story garden office 
buildings across the street from it," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're putting in a pair of 24-story towers connected to the airport by a 
monorail." 
</P>
<P>
Office rents next to the airport have soared to $2.50 a square foot from 50 
cents a square foot in 1975, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1966, when McDonnell Douglas Realty first started looking at airport 
area land, "values in the area were $10,000 to $15,000 an acre," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the company sold a 1.9-acre site less than 100 yards from the airport 
for $1.99 million, or nearly 100 times the 1966 cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw it up for sale again the other day," Young said, "so I called the 
agent and asked the price." 
</P>
<P>
The owners are asking $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"And what has happened in the past is just a fraction of what we will see in 
the future. Values will be triple or quadruple what we've seen," Young 
maintains. 
</P>
<P>
"Already, we are seeing low-rise offices being torn down to make way for 
high-rises. And the development impact fans out for about 20 miles."

"We sometimes meet visitors coming into Orange County from other countries -- 
guests of the United States government. These people hear such wonderful things

"Several years ago, we were required to convert our restrooms for handicapped 
use. The contractor botched it so badly that we had to put a trailer out front 
with portable restrooms. It was so strange; someone would come up to ask where 
the restrooms were, and you'd point to the curb. People would look at you like, 
'You've got to be kidding!' "

"Departure boards were very confusing. I was flying to Albuquerque through Las 
Vegas and Phoenix. On the departure board they showed Las Vegas and Phoenix as 
a flight, but they didn't show Albuquerque. When I asked when my flight was 
leaving, the attendant said it left ages ago. She had my ticket stub and didn't 
even tell me the plane was leaving. I had to wait for the next plane, and there 
were no lockers to store my luggage. And when I went to Delaney's, they weren't 
serving alcohol because they'd lost their liquor license or something."

"It's not very convenient for us. We travel with 45 or 50 people, depending on 
the time of year. Someone would have to give up a slot for us to take a charter 
in and out. We often fly in late at night, and there's a curfew at John Wayne. 
We can't get our buses onto the Tarmac, which we can at Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to use John Wayne; it's a lot closer for us. Ontario is 45 minutes 
with no traffic, an hour and 10 minutes with traffic, but we save time by 
getting off the ground more quickly."

SOUND ADVICE FOR EASIER AIR TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Jet-setting isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers feel anxious about flying, frustrated over packing, worried about 
protecting valuables and stiff from sitting too long in uncomfortable airline 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, all they really need is sound advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easing Flying Fears 
</P>
<P>
If you have a fear of flying, you're not alone. A Gallup poll found that 48% of 
airline passengers are at least occasionally afraid while in the air, even 
though flying is roughly 35 times safer than driving in a car. 
</P>
<P>
People who have little flying experience or have claustrophobic reactions are 
candidates for flying anxiety, says Jerry Kasdorf, director of the PhobiaCare 
Treatment Center in Tustin. "Preparing for your flight as you would an 
important meeting can help you get a grip on your worst fears," says Kasdorf. 
If you're unfamiliar with flying, he recommends a visit to the airport, maybe 
even talking to a pilot. Familiarize yourself with the flight routine. (Kasdorf 
has his clients view a videotape that shows them what to expect). 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety intensifies if you think you won't be able to contain your panic. "Most 
people panic when the door closes," Kasdorf says. "They start thinking they're 
going to lose their mind or start screaming." 
</P>
<P>
You can't control the airplane, but you can concentrate on controlling your 
reactions. Accept the fact that planes encounter air turbulence about 10% of 
the time and your best bet is to wear a seat belt at all times and stay as 
comfortable as you can. 
</P>
<P>
Distract yourself before and during the flight by listening to relaxation 
tapes, performing simple exercises, reading or talking with the person seated 
next to you. Planning how you will spend your time in the air will give you a 
feeling of control. 
</P>
<P>
Often, Kasdorf says, people attribute their anxiety solely to the thought of 
flying, when other anxiety-producing factors may be contributing. "Anxiety is 
an accumulation of stress factors," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Minimize departure-day stress by packing early and allowing yourself plenty of 
time to arrive at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The day before your trip, eat nutritious foods, such as fresh fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains, and avoid stimulants, such as alcohol, caffeine 
and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major sources of anxiety is caused by separation, Kasdorf says. If 
at all possible, travel with a companion. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, realize that you won't allay all your fears in one flight. Set a goal 
to improve each time you fly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packing It All 
</P>
<P>
There's an art to reducing your travel kit to the smallest possible package. 
The key is to make each item do the work of three or four. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Leslie, fashion director of the Fashion Island stores in Newport Beach, 
has to be well-dressed, "but I hate to take luggage." She developed a system 
for trimming her traveling wardrobe to a manageable size. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trip, Leslie hangs her initial choices on a rolling rack and begins 
to weed out unrealistic items. 
</P>
<P>
Comfort comes before style, especially with shoes. For outfits, she considers 
the wrinkle factor. Polyester may have a bad reputation, but it travels well, 
as does silk and lightweight wool. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimum shoes," Leslie says, "only one handbag, if possible, and neutral 
hosiery. One blouse works with two or three outfits. Resist the temptation to 
throw in another top at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
Stack everything that goes with an outfit together and separate the layers with 
clear-plastic cleaning bags to prevent wrinkles. Pack shoes around the 
perimeter of the bag to keep clothes from shifting. Roll up belts and tuck them 
in the shoes. Reduce your travel gear to a single carry-on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protecting Valuables 
</P>
<P>
While John Wayne Airport is no hotbed of crime, theft is reported every week. 
The most common crimes are "distraction thefts" of carry-on luggage, says Lt. 
Ken Lohrey of the Sheriff's Department's Airport Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"Thieves use diversionary tactics such as asking for change or directions, or 
dropping coins on the floor, and when you play Mr. Nice Guy and help them, they 
split with your briefcase," Lohrey says. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to pick out thieves in the controlled chaos of the airport, 
Lohrey says, because they wear business attire to blend in with the crowds. 
Security agents look for people who are hanging around but who don't seem to be 
doing anything. Thieves step to the back of the line or hang around the snack 
bar and are overly observant of people's bags. 
</P>
<P>
If you put your carry-on on the floor, hold it between your feet so you'll know 
if someone tries to move it and don't ask anybody to watch it for you, Lohrey 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally luggage is stolen from the baggage carousel, but the thefts go 
mostly unreported because travelers think the airline lost it. Lohrey 
recommends picking up bags as soon as you get off the plane and checking ID 
tags so you don't accidently take off with look-alike luggage. 
</P>
<P>
In auto burglaries at the airport, sound systems are the most popular target, 
Lohrey says. Thieves break into cars that have valuables lying in plain sight, 
so preventing crime requires common sense: "Completely lock your car, roll the 
windows all the way up and keep valuables at home or in the trunk," says 
Lohrey. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is anxious and in a hurry when they're traveling, but they need to 
pay attention to what's going on around them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercising Out Aches 
</P>
<P>
Racing across continents and oceans is all well and good, but add fatigue, 
skewed meal schedules, changing time zones, a moistureless atmosphere in a 
cramped cabin and exertion from carrying overstuffed bags and the trip begins 
to take its toll on you mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
A program of limbering and aerobic exercises during and after long plane 
flights will quickly reduce most of the sluggishness felt from traveling, says 
Dr. Geoffrey Ricchio of Ricchio Chiropractic Rehabilitation Center in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
While on the plane, walk as much as possible. There is often a clear space 
around the exits on larger planes where you can put your hands on your hips and 
gently twist to relax your back and leg muscles. Pull your knees to your chest 
while in your seat to stretch your legs and lower back. Roll your head gently 
to stretch your neck and shoulder muscles. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach your destination, allow exercise time in your day's itinerary. 
Studies show that vigorous exercise for 45 minutes to one hour during the day 
will help adjust your internal time clock (but working out before bed may wind 
you up). After exercising, take a hot shower. 
</P>
<P>
Take advantage of the exercise facilities in the hotel. If you're a 
weightlifter, go easy with less weight but more repetitions. Swimming reduces 
the effects of jet lag and muscle stiffness, and walking is the sport of 
serious travelers. 
</P>
<P>
If you develop a mild muscle pull or strain, apply a bag of ice to the ache, 
followed by a hot shower. Alternating heat and cold is the best home remedy for 
mild strains, Ricchio says.
