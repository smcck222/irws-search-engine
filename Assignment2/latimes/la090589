Photo, Crash aftermath -- Seven people were hurt Monday morning, none 
seriously, when a driver who led San Diego police on a 15-minute chase crashed 
into a car at 8th Street and Euclid Avenue in National City, setting off a 
chain collision involving six cars. Fausto Medina, 20, was arrested on 
suspicion of felony auto theft and felony hit-and-run driving. Police said the 
suspect lost a tire and was driving only on a rim toward the end of the chase.

NEW STUDY TO TRACK SOURCE AND TYPE OF AIR POLLUTANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1950s, meteorologists suspected that not all of San Diego County's 
dirty air was home-grown. After all, they reasoned, if balloons released by 
school children in Los Angeles occasionally came back to earth in San Diego, 
wasn't it likely that air currents also carried pollutants generated by 
factories and automobiles in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Technicians subsequently developed complicated monitoring and modeling programs 
that proved winds were in fact transporting pollution to San Diego from Los 
Angeles, and county officials now know that out-of-town pollution plays a role 
in two-thirds of the days when San Diego exceeds state and federal limits for 
ozone. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution control programs now take "LA transport" into account, but state and 
federal regulators also have required the county's Air Pollution Control 
District to create a plan that will reduce the amount of ozone generated within 
the county's border. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the APCD is conducting a $1.6-million project that uses a boat, 
balloons and airplanes to monitor pollution within the county. Those mobile 
monitors have been augmented by a web of land-based monitoring stations in such 
diverse locations as San Clemente Island, Ramona and Mount Soledad. The 
airplanes and balloons will grab air samples at various heights, giving 
officials a three-dimensional look at the county's air quality. 
</P>
<P>
The study is designed to determine how much pollution is carried into the 
county as well as how much is generated within the county. If Mother Nature 
cooperates -- the wrong wind currents can make monitoring difficult -- the 
complex monitoring system will give an accurate picture of where pollution is 
generated and where winds carry it. The monitors also will help to determine 
what chemical reactions are occurring once pollution is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Hydrocarbons 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring network will pay special attention to hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxide, which are emitted by industrial sources and motor vehicles. Those 
pollutants are known to react together to form ozone. 
</P>
<P>
While the county easily could order overall reductions in hydrocarbons and 
oxides, it is "critical" that the pollution control plan include a combination 
of reductions that will generate a reduction in ozone, said Richard H. Smith, 
APCD's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complicated process because simply decreasing hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxide won't necessarily bring a resulting decrease in ozone," Smith said. "You 
have to determine the effects of reducing both by varying amounts." 
</P>
<P>
The APCD will use a computer model to determine the most effective way to 
reduce ozone. The model will track ozone as hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide are 
decreased. Technicians will check the validity of the model against data 
gathered through the ongoing monitoring program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Study for 14 Years 
</P>
<P>
It has been 14 years since the last comprehensive monitoring program was 
conducted, according to Virginia Bigler Engler, a meteorologist with the Air 
Pollution Control District. The county is using federal block grant funds to 
complete the study, which will be used to determine what pollution controls 
would be necessary if oil drilling rigs were to be located off the coast of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The air monitoring program is scheduled to be completed by Sept. 30, but the 
final deadline might be extended if desired wind currents fail to materialize. 
That was the case in Sacramento, recently, when the monitoring program was put 
on hold after wind patterns blowing through the region kept the air unusually 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring program is designed to collect data "when there is definitely no 
influence from Los Angeles as well as when there is," according to Hal W. 
Brown, a senior meteorologist with APCD. With that data in hand, "you can then 
replicate the model and feel more comfortable" with the resulting ozone control 
strategy, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
If everything goes right with the monitoring study "we'll know what's coming 
into the county and what's going on inside the county," Brown said.

<P>
For parent Gwen Tamayo, the start of the new school year in a county that is 
growing topsy-turvy is like an extended good-news, bad-news joke. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Tamayo, who recently moved from North Carolina to a new 
housing development in burgeoning eastern Oceanside, was the letter she 
received from the Vista Unified School District announcing that her 
neighborhood will be served by a brand-new elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news was that the school -- Empresa Elementary -- won't be open this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that her child could attend classes in temporary buildings on 
a campus where a new middle school opened just last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news was that, when Tamayo took her child to the school last Thursday, 
she found an instant -- albeit temporary -- campus of classrooms in trailers, 
with no playground equipment and no grass. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that when her permanent school opens -- maybe in January, 
maybe in February -- it will be a state-of-the-art educational facility on a 
10-acre hilltop with a 270-degree view that sweeps over much of Oceanside's and 
Vista's rolling hills -- carpeted by thousands of new homes recently completed 
or still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe that's bad news -- because still more schools will have to be built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outstripped by Growth 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to me," Tamayo sighed last Thursday after dropping off 
her child on the first day of classes in the Vista school district, which 
serves eastern Oceanside as well. "Shouldn't they build schools before they 
build the homes?" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but that's not the reality in San Diego's suburban communities this 
fall, where growth is outstripping public education's ability to accommodate 
new students, and officials from Fallbrook to San Ysidro are hustling for money 
to build new schools as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
New-school construction money from the state has dried up. Voters, for the most 
part, refuse to assess themselves higher taxes. The funds derived from 
developer-impact fees cover less than half the cost of new schools. And it's 
the exception when a developer will pop for a new school to serve the 
neighborhoods he creates. More typically, at best, these large-scale builders 
allow their developments to be taxed -- assessments that will be unilaterally 
passed on to the new homeowners when they move in. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has left some schools at 50% over their designed capacity. In some 
districts -- including Vista, San Marcos and Escondido's elementaries -- a 
third of the students are taught in portable classrooms, outside the main 
school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round school -- with three-week mini-breaks instead of the traditional 
summer vacation -- is a fact of life for about 25% of the county's students. 
And some school officials are talking of worst-case scenarios: double sessions 
-- with increased teaching costs -- where some children could begin classes as 
early as 7 a.m. and others still be in school after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Climb Higher 
</P>
<P>
The rate of student enrollment is going to climb even higher. In the past 11 
years, enrollment in the county increased 14%. In the next 11 years, it is 
expected to increase 41%. 
</P>
<P>
The faster the county grows, the more behind the schools get. 
</P>
<P>
Planners for the county's Office of Education figure that by the year 2000, 200 
new schools will have to be constructed in San Diego County -- over and above 
the 495 that now serve it. Administrators who thought they got into the 
business of developing curriculums, improving teaching methods and producing 
smart kids are now finding themselves distracted by the business of playing 
with mirrors and learning the ropes of school financing schemes just so they 
can find classrooms for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to consider myself an instructional superintendent," said Gilberto 
Anzaldua, superintendent of the 
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro Union School District, which is expected to be the county's 
fastest-growing district over the next 11 years. "I want to be working with the 
kids, but I'm spending time looking for where the next batch of money will come 
from to build schools. You've got to do that before you can provide the 
instruction." 
</P>
<P>
Mac Bernd, superintendent of the San Marcos Unified School District, added, 
only half-facetiously: "We don't have nightmares of having classes in tents 
instead of in classrooms. A superintendent's nightmare is having the roof of 
the tent half-eaten by moths." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Serious Challenge' 
</P>
<P>
Tom Robinson, the director of facilities for the county's Office of Education, 
said that every child in the county will find a classroom this fall -- but may 
not be in the school closest to home and may find himself in temporary 
facilities considered inadequate for the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very serious challenge over the next five years in trying to 
identify a means of financing the necessary school facilities," Robinson said. 
"The crisis hasn't occurred yet, but it's upon us." 
</P>
<P>
The San Ysidro district's pace-setting growth will come in part because of the 
explosion of apartment housing there, much of it publicly subsidized, and 
because of the high ratio of children per family and the frequency of multiple 
families occupying single dwelling units. 
</P>
<P>
But after San Ysidro, the next nine fastest-growing districts in the county, 
according to projections by the San Diego Assn. of Governments, are all in 
North County, where entire tracts of open land are being developed into new 
neighborhoods and where many young, affluent families are drawn in part by the 
perception of good, homogeneous -- and smaller -- schools. 
</P>
<P>
And while some of the county's largest schools are in the metropolitan San 
Diego Unified School District, the county's two largest high schools are in the 
Poway Unified -- Mt. Carmel High School, serving Rancho Penasquitos with 3,300 
students, and Poway High School, with 3,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
The most hard-pressed district in the county, by Robinson's estimate, is the 
Vista Unified, where classes started last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portable Dilemma 
</P>
<P>
More than a third of Vista's 17,000 students are assigned to 
trailers-turned-classrooms erected on playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Portable, relocatable classrooms may relieve classroom shortage on any given 
campus, but they don't alleviate congestion -- and, in fact, exacerbate it -- 
in the libraries, cafeterias, computer learning centers and on the playgrounds. 
Assemblies, recesses and lunch periods must be staggered to accommodate all the 
children, and moms and dads groan as they face increased traffic when they drop 
off and pick up their young charges daily. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Vista school officials asked voters to approve a $63-million 
bond measure to rehabilitate older schools and build new ones. The measure 
failed, and this November the same voters will be asked to approve a 
$38.8-million bond to finance half of the district's wish list of new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The district says it needs 17 new schools by the year 2000 -- 13 elementary 
schools, three middle schools and a new high school. 
</P>
<P>
If the Legislature agrees, as has been proposed, to put a $1-billion school 
bonds issue on the ballot in June to help districts finance new construction, 
Vista -- like other districts -- would hope that the state would match the 
locally generated money with an equal amount of state bond money. Districts 
that offer to match state funds with their own will receive a higher priority 
when the money is doled out. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Vista bond measure fails in November, says Supt. Rene Townsend, 
"there will be no way to avoid double sessions in two or three years. We will 
have run out of solutions, and we will have run out of space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staggered Sessions 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Vista's 11 elementary schools and three middle schools will begin 
year-round schedules in July. The technique, in which students are divided into 
four staggered tracks -- three of which, at any given time, are in session -- 
has the logistical effect of increasing school capacities by a third. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's elementary schools faced a similar plight to Vista's, and were 
looking to go on a year-round schedule and possible double sessions as well, 
until voters there in June approved a $27-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've maximized almost all our campuses as far as additional relocatables are 
concerned," said Gene Hartline, assistant superintendent for business services 
for the 16-school district. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the district's elementary schools, their campuses already saturated 
with relocatable classrooms, closed their doors to new enrollment last spring, 
and one school was on a year-round schedule, but the bond measure has given the 
district new breathing room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now construction is under way next to Kit Carson Park for a so-called instant 
campus -- L. R. Green Elementary School, where relocatable classrooms will be 
put on foundations in time for 600 students to attend classes in January. In 
the meantime, those students are taking courses in temporary facilities at two 
other elementary schools in Escondido, similar to the situation in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido school administrators are also looking at moving their management 
offices to a shopping center, freeing up a 9-acre site that will be 
reconfigured into an elementary school in time for classes in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Escondido hopes to open five new elementary schools by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"To bring all of our schools to within their designed enrollment capacities, 
without having to rely on relocatables, we'd need four new schools right now," 
Hartline said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Room 
</P>
<P>
Just as Escondido will abandon its management offices to make room for a new 
school, the San Dieguito Union High School District is also doing some 
shuffling to accommodate more students. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators there are moving into a leased professional building; a 
maintenance facility that had occupied part of the San Dieguito High School 
campus will be moved to the old district offices, and school buses that had 
been parked on the campus will now be parked at the Del Mar Fairgrounds -- all 
so more portable classrooms can be added at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
In the Poway Unified School District -- the county's third-largest with 23,500 
students in 20 schools -- five new schools are under construction, including a 
high school to serve Rancho Bernardo and relieve overcrowding at the Poway and 
Mt. Carmel High Schools that are now 50% above capacity. Supt. Bob Reeves says 
another 10 schools will be needed within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Poway voters last year rejected, by a scant 117 votes, a $56-million bond 
issue, and now Reeves is looking to developers -- and ultimately new homeowners 
-- to help finance the new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even the best of planning doesn't always accommodate the growth in North 
County. Consider what happened in the Oceanside Unified School District, which 
is growing by about 1,000 students -- or the equivalent of more than one 
elementary school -- every year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the district opened a new elementary school, Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected, based on our projections and growth in the area, that the school 
would serve about 500 youngsters that first year," said district spokesman Dan 
Armstrong. "But when school opened up, 750 kids showed up."

LABORER FOUND DEAD; 3 MEN SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A laborer was killed early Monday morning in East County and law enforcement 
officials said they were seeking three Latino males who may have fled to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Dead was Felipe Manjarrez, 54, who was discovered at his home in the 2000 block 
of Willow Glen Drive near El Cajon. The man, found partially clothed, 
apparently suffered severe trauma to his head, but officials were awaiting the 
results of an autopsy before pinpointing the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. Danny Goodrich of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, 
Manjarrez had been seen arguing with three men earlier in the week. After the 
body was found, Border Patrol officials were called in to help track shoe 
prints that Goodrich said indicated the suspects fled toward Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Juan, 5 feet, 3 inches tall, 130 pounds with 
short, black wavy hair and brown eyes; Daniel, 5-foot-11, 170 pounds, with 
brown wavy hair, brown eyes, a large nose, a deformed left thumb and partially 
deaf; and Chino, 5-foot-4, 140 pounds, curly black Afro-style hair, brown eyes 
and fair skin.

2 INMATES WALK AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN JAIL IN SECOND ESCAPE IN 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in two days, two inmates escaped from County Jail downtown. 
The pair vanished Monday from a freight dock where they were unloading supplies 
for the jail. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates were identified as Steven Michael Walker, 27, who was in custody 
for false impersonation, possession of stolen property and car theft, and Wayne 
Allen Thrash, a 27-year-old in custody for grand theft and petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Thrash, described as jail trusties, walked away from the jail work 
site at about 3:10 a.m., and were last seen a block away, walking on foot near 
the 200 block of B Street. 
</P>
<P>
The escapes followed a more-daring jail break Sunday morning, when two other 
inmates -- one convicted of murdering a child and the other described as a 
proven escape artist -- flung an improvised rope from the roof of the downtown 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday evening, all four inmates remained at large. Officials said the 
jail was put in a lockdown status, that outside visits were canceled and that 
all inmates were restricted to cells and day rooms. 
</P>
<P>
According to Detective Edward Augustine of the sheriff's jail investigations 
detail, Walker and Thrash were minimum security trusties who were working in 
the loading dock under the supervision of civilian jail employees. Augustine 
said no regular deputies were available at that early morning time to monitor 
their work activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inmates Walked Away 
</P>
<P>
The detective said that Walker and Thrash simply walked away from the job site 
next to the downtown jail. Officials later found discarded jail clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 27, was described as a black male, 5 feet, 11 inches tall, 200 pounds, 
with a scar on his left cheek. Authorities said he was known to frequent the 
Chula Vista and Logan Heights areas. 
</P>
<P>
Thrash, 29, was described as a white male, 6 feet tall, 205 pounds, with brown 
hair and blue eyes, and with a scar on his chin and under his nose. Officials 
said he frequented the La Mesa and Logan Heights areas. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier escape, which occurred sometime before 10 a.m. Sunday morning, 
escape artist John J. Pugh, 37, and Leon Morris, 35, were discovered missing 
during a head count of 11 high-security inmates who had used an outside 
exercise area atop the eight-story downtown jail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that Pugh and Morris forced a hole in the chain link fence 
that surrounds the rooftop exercise area and used a makeshift rope to lower 
themselves 30 feet to the roof of the adjoining county courthouse. From there, 
they crawled into an unstaffed Sheriff's Department office in a wing of the 
courthouse, then ran down a courthouse hallway and fled the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Both escapees were awaiting transfer from the central jail to a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentenced in Murder Case 
</P>
<P>
Morris, of Spring Valley, was sentenced Friday to up to life in prison for 
murdering his girlfriend's 2-year-old son. He was convicted in December, 1987, 
of second-degree murder in the death of Todd Allen Williams, who died of 
multiple injuries from a blunt object, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh, of San Diego, was convicted of burglary and possession of stolen 
property, and sentenced to six years in prison. He also received an additional 
two years in state prison for his July 17 escape from the El Cajon jail. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting sentencing then on his burglary conviction, Pugh used a similar 
rope made of bedsheets to lower himself from the seventh floor of the East 
County Regional Center in El Cajon in what officials said was the first 
successful breakout in the El Cajon jail's eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
He was recaptured three weeks ago by San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
The last attempted escape at the downtown jail was several years ago, but 
specific records weren't immediately available, authorities said.

SIMI ACCUSED OF IGNORING OVERCROWDING IN RENTALS; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORS SAY HOUSES ARE ILLEGALLY PACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent Simi Valley businessman owns rundown suburban homes that are being 
used as illegal boardinghouses for immigrant workers, according to neighbors 
who say their repeated objections have been ignored by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Landegger, a real estate broker and publisher with extensive 
investments in rental houses, is the largest among nine property owners under 
scrutiny by the city, which recently opened an investigation into the matter 
because of a record number of citizens' complaints, said Diane Davis-Crompton, 
the city's director of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
According to complaints on file with the city, as well as interviews with 
neighbors, the houses owned by Landegger and others serve as residences for 10 
to 50 laborers, mostly Latino men, who work as gardeners, housekeepers, 
construction workers and other modestly paid positions in the service and 
agricultural industries. 
</P>
<P>
While the city zoning code requires a permit for houses where six or more 
unrelated people pay a fee to live, tenants say they cannot afford to move and 
city officials suggest their often illegal immigration status prevents them 
from exposing their living conditions and forcing landlords to comply with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Piranhas' 
</P>
<P>
"There are always people who, like piranhas, will feed on unfortunate people 
like that," said Simi Valley Councilman Glen McAdoo, the most outspoken council 
member on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"These illegal aliens who come over are just seeking a better way of life. 
Whether illegal or not, the truth of the matter is there are people who will 
take advantage of them and take them for every cent they've got, and who are 
they going to complain to?" 
</P>
<P>
Landegger denied knowing about the conditions at his properties and called 
himself a victim of unscrupulous tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Simi Valley's recent efforts to notify landlords of complaints and seek 
voluntary compliance with the law, neighbors say they have been telling 
officials for a year or more about the problem without results -- publicly at 
City Council meetings and privately in phone calls to police and other 
municipal offices. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that because an influential person is owning the house, the city has 
done nothing," said a neighbor of 1988 Morley St., an alleged boardinghouse 
owned by the president of a local escrow company and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Graham Street expressed similar frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Complaints 
</P>
<P>
"I've given them more license plate numbers than you can shake a fist at," said 
Ginger Trematore, who claims she has been telling authorities about a 
Landegger-owned house at 1240 Graham St. for three years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials including Mayor Greg Stratton and Davis-Crompton and her staff 
insist that evidence, not influence, is the only factor they have considered in 
pursuing crowding complaints. If the city has been slow to respond, they said, 
it is because such complaints are difficult to prove without tenants' 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't take that particularity -- influence -- into consideration, and we 
enforce the laws across the board," said Jocelyn Reed, deputy director of 
environmental services and supervisor of the department's code-enforcement 
unit. "Our main concern is obtaining enough evidence to obtain a conviction if 
we pursue the matter in a court situation." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that since the city responds to individual complaints, she was unable 
to estimate how widespread the boardinghouses are. 
</P>
<P>
Landegger, 55, is the largest landlord under investigation. He owns at least 77 
properties in Simi Valley, according to Davis-Crompton. Landegger is a former 
chairman of Simi Valley Bank and former president of the local Board of 
Realtors, according to "Who's Who in California." He operates under the names 
Capital Real Estate, Cal-West Realty, the Landegger Finance Co., and a 
partnership called Mosland -- all of which of own rentals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Unaware 
</P>
<P>
Landegger, who owns two houses under investigation by the city, at 1663 
Anderson St. and 2234 Calahan Ave., said he had been unaware of the 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I am a victim," Landegger said in a prepared statement. "I rent a 
house to someone, the rental agreement is very clear and it is explained very 
clearly to the tenant that they are the only ones to occupy the property. And 
if one moves, all must move. And no one else is allowed to stay at the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had to evict tenants I have found in violation of this, and will 
continue to do so." He declined to comment beyond the prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Landegger also manages the property at 1988 Morley St. that has come to the 
city's attention as an alleged boardinghouse. Property owner Mike Schweitzer, 
president of Tujunga Escrow Co., said last week he hadn't seen the house in 10 
years, and that he had no idea what was going on there. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as an inept landlord who would just as soon forget about the 
property he invests in, Schweitzer said that when he received notice from the 
city about neighbors' allegations, he immediately called Landegger and told him 
to take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not renting it as a boardinghouse, and I was not aware all those people 
were living there," said Schweitzer. "When we signed the rental agreement, 
there were two couples, referred by Capital." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends of Gallegly 
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer and his wife Marcie are longtime friends of U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley) and his wife, Janice, who used to work as Schweitzer's 
secretary in the escrow business. The two couples own investment property 
together including rental houses at 1353 and 1365 Agnew St. Neither of those 
houses are named in crowding complaints, and the congressman has no interest in 
the property on Morley Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Schweitzers and the Galleglys also share ownership of an office building at 
1791 Erringer Road, which houses Gallegy's campaign headquarters as well as 
Landegger's chief real estate company, Capital Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, who opposes granting amnesty to illegal aliens and favors criminal 
penalties for their employers, said he had no knowledge of problems involving 
houses owned by his associates. The conditions, as described by a reporter, 
should be corrected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care whose name is on the ownership title," he said. "I believe people 
who break the law should be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Schweitzer said they could understand neighbors' anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame them," Schweitzer said. "They're right. It's a single-family 
house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communal Existence 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors describe scenes reminiscent of rural migrant workers' camps: trucks 
making daily pickups of workers, a change in residents every few months and a 
communal existence that generally clashes with suburban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty to 50 Mexicans are renting rooms" says a complaint against the 
Schweitzers' house on Morley Street. "Isn't this considered boarding in a 
residential area?" 
</P>
<P>
"Drop-off for illegal aliens, people living in garage," says a complaint about 
a Landegger-owned house at 1663 Anderson St. "Twenty to 35 persons living in a 
three-bedroom house . . . drop off for dayworkers," says another. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers them the most, neighbors say, is that the tenants are often large 
groups of single men rather than families. Parties, profanity and public 
urination are among the disturbances reported by neighbors, and women said they 
felt threatened by stares and off-hand sexual remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to do yardwork in front in shorts sometimes and haven't been able to do 
that because the last time I did it they started whistling," said the Morley 
Street resident, who did not want to be identified. She said she called the 
police and was told there was nothing they could do unless the men touched her. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Graham Street, Rosie Garcia, said her four daughters no longer 
feel comfortable sitting or working in their yard because of the men living in 
a Landegger-owned house across the street at 1240 Graham St. Last Father's Day, 
the girls gave their father a security screen door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Families Anymore' 
</P>
<P>
"I mean they're my race, they're Mexican, but it's the idea of their not being 
families anymore," Garcia said in explaining her objections. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark also has experienced a rash of complaints about overcrowded tract 
houses and their byproducts -- noise, congested residential streets, clashing 
life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark police warned citizens in July against driving through Dorothy Avenue 
in that city's old downtown section after a street brawl between residents of a 
single-family house at 348 Dorothy Ave. and those of an allegedly overcrowded 
residence at 333 Dorothy Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The fight erupted after an Anglo resident reportedly became angry over an 
insult to his wife by Latino neighbors. A series of similar disturbances in the 
same tract has prompted the Moorpark City Council to hire an additional code 
enforcer and request stepped-up police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crime Happens' 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners said racial prejudice played no role in their complaints. "I 
don't really care what nationality these folks are," said Theresa Rini of 
Moorpark. "I think problems start occurring when you stuff a bunch of bodies 
into a house. I think crime happens because of it." 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, a second Morley Street resident said her home was burglarized 
about 18 months ago and that many of her belongings were found by police in a 
boardinghouse on another street. She said police told her the merchandise was 
being resold in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The police were aware," the resident said, "they knew exactly where to go and 
when to go and had been watching them." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Paul Miller said he was unaware of crowding as a 
problem. "I don't recall that issue coming in," Miller said of reports he 
receives from the field. 
</P>
<P>
A Landegger-owned house at 1551 Sitka Ave. in Simi Valley was the scene of a 
fatal stabbing last month, although the assistant district attorney handling 
the case said it appeared to be a premeditated crime and not the result of a 
spontaneous fight related to crowding. Two suspects are in custody at the 
Ventura County Jail and a preliminary hearing has been set for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4-Room House 
</P>
<P>
A tenant and the apparent matriarch of the Sitka Avenue household where the 
stabbing occurred said 13 Guatemalan immigrants lived in the small, four-room 
house at the time of the killing. In reporting the incident, police themselves 
described the single-family suburban residence as a boardinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who identified herself only as Octavilla, said seven renters have 
moved since then and that she would move too if she could find another 
affordable place. A baby-sitter who earns $150 a week, Octavilla said the six 
remaining tenants share a monthly rent of $975, the same rate charged at other 
Landegger-owned houses visited by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
One such house, at 1305 Agnew St. in Simi Valley, has been missing a bathroom 
sink for months while its tenants -- an undetermined number of Mexican men 
ranging in age from 18 to 25 -- have been shaving and brushing their teeth in 
the kitchen, said a visiting friend, carpenter Marcelino Silva. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants -- who included a fast-food worker, a janitor and a gardener -- 
said they were reluctant to criticize their landlord and declined to allow a 
reporter inside the house, whose peeling paint, dirt yard and rotting woodwork 
was typical of some two dozen Landegger-owned houses viewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster," said Silva. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Trend 
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding complaints are part of a regional trend, according to Ventura 
County labor experts, who say a dearth of low-income housing coupled with 
dwindling ranch-provided housing is creating a new version of labor camps in 
the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"The ranching community is basically getting out of the housing business 
altogether," said Jesse Ornelas, project manager for the Cabrillo Economic 
Development Corp., a private nonprofit group trying to develop affordable 
housing in Ventura County. "So what occurs is they are forced into the outlying 
communities nearby the agricultural industry in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Families are doubling and tripling up, Ornelas noted, while groups of single 
men band together to share expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lloyd, retired manager of the now-defunct Coastal Growers Assn. in Oxnard, 
a citrus-growers' cooperative that ran a large labor camp, said the high cost 
of insurance and construction prevents ranchers from building housing for 
workers. Farm workers also prefer to find their own homes as they settle here 
and apply for citizenship instead of returning to their native countries, Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Violates Every Rule' 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in general about the suburban labor camp trend, Lloyd said: "The city 
doesn't even want to admit it exists because it violates every rule in the 
book." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's action has mainly consisted of writing letters to Landegger, the 
Schweitzers and the other landlords asking for voluntary compliance in applying 
for boardinghouse permits. The cases won't be referred to the city attorney for 
prosecution until a third letter has been sent without improvement, said 
Davis-Crompton. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has referred only one case to the city attorney's office, a house 
at 1425 Sycamore St. where the tenants, all Anglo, are cooperating with the 
city in filing complaints against their landlords, said Reed of the 
code-enforcement unit. The landlords of record are Kerry Lynch and Wendy Teeter 
of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Other landlords whose properties have generated overcrowding complaints are: 
Ignacio Torres of Regan Circle in Simi Valley, for a house at 1572 Dakin St.; 
Rosendo and Lorrain Cueto of Fullerton, for a house at 1632 Casarin Ave.; 
Anooshavan and Roobina Sarkisian of LaVerne, for a house at 1710 Patricia Ave.; 
Cynthia Caiazzo of Ventura Avenue in Simi Valley, for a house at 1481 First 
St., and Maximo and Gloria Vizcardo of Fallon Circle in Simi Valley, for a 
house at 1684 Sutter St. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Probe 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated matter, a couple on Hemway Court is under investigation for 
running a day-care center in their home without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the city has been doing all it can to obtain voluntary compliance by 
landlords because illegal boardinghouse violations are difficult to prosecute. 
While a standard building and housing code used by Simi Valley calls for a 
minimum 300 square feet per resident, Reed said the city had elected not to 
enforce the regulation because it could hurt families with children living in 
small, older houses or condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, liberalized legal definitions of what constitutes a family, 
stringent rules for obtaining search warrants to inspect the houses, and a lack 
of cooperation from fearful residents all make boardinghouse cases tough to 
prove in court, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As several city officials and field experts noted, there is the prospect of 
putting people out on the street and, in trying to cope with overcrowding, only 
contributing to homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said: "It's a bull they don't want to fight with."

RESEDA PURSUES LOST POPULARITY; 
</P>
<P>
MERCHANTS WANT REVITILIZATION TO WOO CUSTOMERS BACK FROM MALLS 
</P>

<P>
Along Sherman Way in Reseda, cars whir day and night past a sign that reads: 
"Reseda . . . Hub of the West Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Reseda was the west San Fernando Valley's shopping hub. But now, 
merchants say, the passing cars don't stop, so the people inside them don't 
shop -- at least not in Reseda. Like the community it describes, the old, 
cracked, weather-worn sign needs a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens panel last week proposed a plan to inject some life into the retail 
area at Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard, which has been bled dry by enclosed 
shopping malls. The plan is an attempt to attract new office development and 
spruce up the aging commercial strips to once again attract strolling shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
One tool to achieve that aim is to ban certain businesses, such as automotive 
repair shops, which the plan calls unnecessary and undesirable in a shopping 
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Year Study 
</P>
<P>
The panel, known as the Citizens Advisory Committee and appointed by Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus, studied Reseda's problems for two years. 
Last year, at Picus' behest, the council imposed temporary development 
restrictions expected to remain in effect until the council acts on the 
committee's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their enthusiasm for the plan, committee members admit that mending 
Reseda's economic wounds probably will be a long, uphill effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big order," said the Rev. Lyle Gordon, a Baptist minister who chaired 
the 14-member committee. "It can't be done overnight, but we hope that what 
we've done will be a long-range solution to stop any further deterioration of 
downtown Reseda." 
</P>
<P>
Although some commercial landlords in Reseda have criticized the plan, saying 
it would limit their options in developing their land, proponents say the 
business climate can only worsen if Reseda isn't cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
So few shoppers walk the streets of Reseda that delicatessen owner Eric 
Rubanowitz resorts to gimmicks to get motorists out of their cars to buy his 
rib specials. Every evening, Rubanowitz has an employee stand in front of his 
Reseda Boulevard restaurant waving a wooden sign cut in the shape of a pig. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody goes to Reseda," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Repair Shops 
</P>
<P>
That's an exaggeration, of course, but shopping malls have steadily sapped 
Reseda of its customers. Boutiques and dress shops have been replaced by thrift 
stores and auto repair shops. Even neighborhood residents stopped shopping in 
an area that once drew people from miles around. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendations cover an area roughly along Sherman Way between 
Hesperia and Wilbur avenues and Reseda Boulevard between Saticoy and Kittridge 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
No new automotive businesses would be allowed if the plan is approved by the 
City Council next year. About 40 other types of new businesses, including 
thrift stores, pornographic businesses and pawnshops, would also be banned. No 
existing businesses would be forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning laws would be changed to allow construction of a mall-like cluster of 
retail shops on one block of Sherman Way and a six-story office building on 
another. All development would have to conform to the plan's standards for 
landscaping, parking, lighting, signs and architectural design. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of competing with the big malls, the plan envisions a future Reseda 
shopping area comparable to the trendy strip of specialty stores along Ventura 
Boulevard west of Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, city planner Deuk Perrin 
said. Office development would bring an infusion of workers who could be 
potential shoppers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Place to Shop 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like driving into Glendale," which has a reputation as a pleasant 
place to shop on foot, said Steve Aufhauser, a committee member and owner of an 
art supply store on Reseda Boulevard. He said that Reseda has become the 
subject of "bad jokes and B-rated movies." 
</P>
<P>
"There's an overabundance of auto mechanics, transmission, tire, body shops and 
that type of low-income, low-rent type of buildings," said Bernard Zwick, 
president of a Reseda baby-supply store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Of Zwick's 22 stores in California, Arizona and Hawaii, only his Reseda store 
draws fewer customers from the surrounding neighborhood than from communities 
farther away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Malls Are Big Draw 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the heart of Reseda's problem, merchants agree. Shopping malls 
draw customers from all over the Valley, but Reseda has trouble even getting 
its own residents to shop on Sherman Way or Reseda Boulevard, said Ann Kinzle, 
director of the area's Chamber of Commerce and a citizens committee member. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the business that Reseda does get is "destination retail," in which 
shoppers come to the area for a specific item, such as one of Zwick's baby 
cribs, said Lee Ambers, a land-use consultant who does work in the Reseda area. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike members of redevelopment agencies, backers of the plan have no legal 
powers to force property owners to upgrade their properties. Backers must rely 
on demand for retail shopping and office space to encourage shop owners to 
refurbish their businesses and to entice developers into the area, Perrin said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan's proponents and critics agree that its success depends on whether 
investors will take a risk on residents' support for new retail businesses. 
They disagree about the answer to that question. 
</P>
<P>
"All those nice things" in the committee's plan "are only going to take place 
if the market warrants it," said Bernard Richter, a commercial landlord who has 
criticized the committee's revitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Richter, whose land on Sherman Way is occupied by seven automotive businesses, 
organized a group of about 20 landowners last year to oppose temporary 
development restrictions expected to remain in effect until the City Council 
decides on the Reseda plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said his opposition is not based on fears that the plan would cost him 
money. In fact, he believes that his land would become more valuable because 
the plan would restrict space for automotive businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Richter said he opposed the plan because it would hurt Reseda. He predicted 
that its ban on certain kinds of businesses will deter investment and reduce 
the value of some properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Unprofitable and unsalable commercial properties will accelerate Reseda's 
decline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Growth 
</P>
<P>
Picus, however, said Reseda is positioned to benefit from continued economic 
growth elsewhere in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"If people find Ventura Boulevard too expensive and Warner Center too 
expensive, they'll say, 'Hey, look at Reseda. It's viable and it's centrally 
located,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda, with a population of about 61,000, had an estimated median household 
income of $32,991 in 1988, according to the U. S. Census. By comparison, the 
estimated 1988 median income was $28,688 for all of Los Angeles County and 
$42,582 in the hillside community of Tarzana, immediately south of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Kinzle spends an hour each day driving through Reseda to look for graffiti or 
storefronts that need cleaning up. Recently she complained to city building 
inspectors about an auto repair shop that was storing engine parts in an open 
area visible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
Fixing Reseda might require little more than improving the area's looks, Kinzle 
said. Landscaping and other proposed improvements, including two crosswalks and 
six traffic lights to ease walking through the area, can make a difference, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zwick agreed. "The area is not clean," he said. "People are not drawn to it to 
shop, and I think the cleanliness and landscaping and things like that are real 
important." 
</P>

SWIFT, TIRELESS 10-YEAR-OLD RUNS TOWARD THE OLYMPICS 
</P>

<P>
A pink clip in her hair, Aminah Haddad pounded down the dirt running track at 
Bell High School one recent afternoon at a speed astonishing for her age. She 
left no one in the dust only because she was practicing by herself. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who will not be 11 until Sept. 13, believes, as do her coaches, that 
she may be running toward a great future; the Olympics already are on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Her best times -- 12.5 seconds in the 100 meters and 26.3 in the 200 -- indeed 
qualify her as a child phenomenon. Many high school athletes can't sprint that 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
"She has incredible natural speed," said Roger Lipkis, coach of the West Valley 
Eagles, a 250-member youth track club in the San Fernando Valley for which 
Aminah runs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Soon 
</P>
<P>
But it may be too soon to predict that someday she will dominate her sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's hard to tell when they are 10 or 11 what their future is," 
Lipkis said. But he added that at this point, Aminah "is significantly better 
than most 10-year-olds. On a local level, in the San Fernando Valley, she's far 
and away the best. On a national level, there are kids who can beat her, but 
most of them are 11 years old. I've seen kids who are incredible at 8, 9 and 10 
who never get any better. When they're 13 you start to see the long-term 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, whose father is a former runner and whose mother used to teach physical 
education, started competing at age 7. In three years she was undefeated 
against girls her age in more than 100 meets. It wasn't until this summer, 
during top national competition, that, to her surprise, she didn't always cross 
the finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who, because she is deaf in one ear must pay closer attention to the 
starter than her competitors, is also coached by her father. With stopwatch in 
hand, he watched her practice recently on the Bell field near their home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Stronger 
</P>
<P>
"She is getting stronger and bigger, and has the intensity and desire," said 
Gerald Haddad, 44, who like his wife, Chestine, is a native Philadelphian. He 
sometimes runs alongside his 4-foot-10, 87-pound daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't beat him," Aminah said. 
</P>
<P>
Haddad said Aminah never tires of practicing and that at this time of the year, 
with the long, arduous track season behind her, she keeps asking him, "Dad, 
when do we start cross-country?" 
</P>
<P>
Shy around adults, Aminah does not offer long discourses on why she runs. She 
just says, "Because it's fun, and I like the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from her interest in track, Aminah is a typical smiling 10-year-old. She 
enjoys playing with her girlfriend, Arlene Ramos, and is still fond of her 
dolls. Fastidious about her appearance, she changes her outfits and her hair 
style several times a day. "She likes to be little Miss Perfect," her father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 Olympics, Aminah sat before her TV and wrote down the marks of 
all the runners. She records her own meet performances on notebook paper 
adorned with hand-drawn hearts. She does aerobics to a Bruce Jenner tape. Carl 
Lewis and Florence Griffith-Joyner are her heroes, though she thinks that when 
she gets older she will do without the kind of flamboyant outfits 
Griffith-Joyner wears. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the 100 meters in the Midget Division (ages 9 and 10) of the 
Hershey National Track Championship at Hershey, Pa., last year, Aminah asked 
her father, "Why is this so easy?" 
</P>
<P>
Haddad told her, "Because you practice all the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perspective on Competition 
</P>
<P>
But it was also last summer, at a meet at Bell High, when Aminah lost to a 
12-year-old girl. "We put her in with older runners to give her a perspective 
on the competition," Haddad said. "She cried. She just couldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel too good," Aminah said, remembering that moment. 
</P>
<P>
But it prepared her for the reality of the tougher national competition. Early 
in July, she finished third in her age division in the 200 meters at the Track 
Athletic Congress National Youth Athletics Championship at the University of 
Texas-Arlington. That remains her biggest thrill "because I had a lot of fun 
there." 
</P>
<P>
In late July, she finished fourth in the 200 and eighth in the 400 at the Track 
City Classic in Eugene, Ore. During that meet she ran 26.3 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
(Her 12.5 in the 100 was run in June at a Junior Olympics qualifying meet at UC 
Irvine.) 
</P>
<P>
After the Oregon meet, Aminah finished fourth out of more than 5,000 finalists 
in the 200 meters at the Junior Olympics in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
And in early August, at the California State Games at Point Loma Nazarene 
College in San Diego, she finished third in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Experience 
</P>
<P>
"This season was a tremendous experience for her because she had never seen 
competition like that," her father said. "She used to think she could give kids 
a head start and still win." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her speed, Aminah has yet to acquire the proper running form. "Her 
technique is not good," Lipkis said. The runner's father added, "We are 
constantly working on her mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't swing my arms high enough," Aminah said. 
</P>
<P>
During the track season, from January to August, Aminah trains with the West 
Valley Eagles twice a week at UCLA, where she has been instructed by former USC 
sprint star Henry Hines, and at Canoga Park High School. She competed in a meet 
every Saturday and often on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"We drive 40 miles to practice and on the other days she says, 'Dad, let's go 
running,' " said Haddad, principal at Town and Country Elementary School in 
South Gate. "She's a competitive young lady." 
</P>
<P>
But trophies don't mean a lot to Aminah, according to her mother. "She's more 
into being part of a team," Chestine said. "When she wins, it's great for the 
moment, then she's back playing. She befriends her competitors, and they comb 
each other's hair." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reliable, Trustworthy 
</P>
<P>
Chestine Haddad said her daughter lives up to her Muslim name of 
Aminah-Takreem-Kibibi Haddad, which means "reliable trustworthy little lady." 
"At school she completes her assignments and has things in on time . . . she's 
very dependable," said the former teacher at Lynwood High School. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, under a Los Angeles busing program, Aminah will attend Oliver W. 
Holmes Junior High School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
And she will continue to dream about winning the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"She insists she's running in Barcelona," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll be too young," maintains Aminah, who would be 13 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A more reasonable goal would be the 1996 Games. "If she continues to run well, 
she might have a shot then," Lipkis said. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who said she won't be too disappointed if she has to wait until '96, 
has another goal: to run the 100 in 10.1. The women's record is 10.49. 
</P>
<P>
Though the words she spoke at the Bell High field that afternoon were few, they 
left no doubt that this is a confident girl who knows what she wants. 
</P>
<P>
And so she fixed her hair and took off down the track. 
</P>

2 SERIOUSLY INJURED, 11 HURT IN 2-CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen people, including 10 children, were injured Monday when two cars 
collided in Sun Valley, Los Angles fire officials said. Only two of the 
victims, a man in one car and a woman in the other, were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The third adult and all 10 children, ages 4 to 12, were treated at the scene 
for minor injuries. The children were taken to area hospitals with the adults 
because they had no way to return home, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cars collided about 5:20 p.m. on Glenoaks Boulevard near Sheldon Street in 
a sparsely populated industrial area. One car was carrying two adults and eight 
children; the other was carrying one adult and two children, Wells said.

CHARGER CUTS INCLUDE SUPER BOWL STAR SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two seasons ago, Timmy Smith set a Super Bowl rushing record, gaining 204 yards 
in the Redskins' 42-10 victory over Denver in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
Monday, he was one of 11 players the Chargers cut to pare their roster to the 
regular-season limit of 47. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Charger running back Gary Anderson, an unsigned free agent, told 
the Chargers: Pay me or trade me. 
</P>
<P>
All right, said rookie running back Marion Butts, Anderson's apparent 
successor, when he heard that news. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been checking that out," Butts said. "He (Anderson) is asking for so much 
money. One individual can contribute to a team, true enough. But there are 
limitations (on what) one individual can do. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the only thing that individual (Anderson) can do is play tailback. 
You put him on kickoffs or kickoff returns and he's going to say, 'Oh no, I'm 
not playing there.' He (Anderson) won't be on no special teams." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning stopped short of saying Butts was his new starting 
first- and second-down running back. So both Butts and Smith said it for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I probably will be," Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most likely it will be Marion Butts," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers open their regular season Sunday against the Raiders in the 
Coliseum. To get down to the 47-man limit Monday, they also waived tight end 
Craig Davis, wide receiver Dokie Williams, defensive end Karl Wilson, guard 
Stacy Searels, free safety Michael Brooks, cornerback Johnny Thomas, inside 
linebacker Ricky Andrews, kicker Chris Bahr, cornerback Elliot Smith and 
defensive end Tyrone Keys. They also placed center/guard Dennis McKnight on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers expect to re-sign Bahr Wednesday because he is a vested veteran. 
That means if another team claims him during the 24-hour waiver period, Bahr 
doesn't have to join that team. He can wait another 24 hours and become a free 
agent. At that point, he can rejoin the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bahr move enables the Chargers to keep rookie quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver, Jim McMahon's backup, on their regular-season roster for one day 
before placing him on injured reserve. Tolliver broke his left collarbone on 
the second-to-last play of Friday's night exhibition finale against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a new NFL rule, if the Chargers had placed Tolliver on injured 
reserve Monday, he would have had to miss the entire season. This way, they can 
reactivate him after six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also stopped short of saying who his starting center will be against 
the Raiders now that McKnight is lost for the year. It will probably be rookie 
Courtney Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But the best answer Henning could come up with when asked if it would be Hall 
or veteran Don Macek, was a curt: "I don't know. One of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if offensive line Coach Larry Beightol knew who the starting center would 
be, Henning said: "He doesn't know either." This is the same Henning who has 
closed practices to the media this week, the first time that has happened with 
this franchise in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Henning continued his purge of older, unproductive players in favor of youth. 
Six drafted rookies -- defensive end Burt Grossman, Hall, Tolliver, Butts, 
swingman Dana Brinson and running back Victor Floyd -- survived the final cut. 
Floyd and Butts tied for the team lead in rushing with 93 yards each during the 
exhibition season. Brinson led the Chargers in receiving with 10 receptions for 
100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like me and Victor (Floyd) are fresh out of college," said Butts, a power 
back at 6-1, 248 pounds. "We're young and fluid and not getting paid that much. 
But what's Gary Anderson asking? He's asking enough that you can basically pay 
all the guys from the third through the 12th round (with the same amount)." 
</P>
<P>
Smith suffered in his competition with Butts because of a bad ankle and the 
resultant inability to raise his value by playing on special teams. "I believe 
I got a fair shot," Smith said. "I just don't think I took advantage of it. In 
this game, you have to play hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Said the not-so-bashful Butts: "I believe I had a terrific preseason." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's college teammate at Texas Tech, rookie free agent Wayne Walker, also 
made the roster as did four other wide receivers -- Anthony Miller, Jamie 
Holland, Quinn Early and Darren Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, Butts and veteran Tim Spencer are the only pure running backs remaining. 
But Brinson, a return specialist and receiver, also comes in as a back on 
third-down plays. And Henning said H-back Rod Bernstine has been working part 
time in practice as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said the Chargers will probably re-sign several of the waived 
rookies and first-year players to the six-man developmental squad the league 
allows teams to keep starting today. 
</P>
<P>
Keys, who started 11 games for the Chargers last year, plans to remain in San 
Diego to rehabilitate the right knee he injured against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has agreed in principle to a salary settlement with the Chargers, 
who were then able to waive him while he was still injured. The alternative was 
the injured reserve list, which would have cost Keys the entire season. Neither 
he nor the Chargers wanted that. But Keys was bitter about the options facing 
him and the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a guy who tests positive for drugs and he's out for four weeks," Keys 
said. "And then you get a guy who's hurt and they want to punish him for the 
whole year. That's kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The loss for the season of long-snapper Dennis McKnight has the Chargers 
looking for a replacement. Andy Parker and Courtney Hall are the current 
candidates. "Yes," said Charger Coach Dan Henning, "that is a major concern." . 
. . On the most nervous day of the year, senses of humor were hard to find, but 
they did exist. "I'm going to Buffalo," said receptionist Stella Viets during a 
mid-morning break. "They're sending three secretaries in return."

CENTER HOPES CIRCUIT CITY WILL SPARK BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
SWEETWATER TOWN &amp; COUNTRY OWNERS, TENANTS LOOK FOR TURNAROUND WITH NEW 
ANCHOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can a single "anchor" tenant revive an ailing shopping center after years of 
decline? 
</P>
<P>
Henry Michan and his two brothers, Mexican-born real estate owners and 
developers who last year bought Sweetwater Town &amp; Country in National City, 
are about to find out. They recently signed Circuit City, a highly successful 
nationwide retailer of consumer electronics and appliances, to a 21-year lease 
in the center. 
</P>
<P>
The trio purchased the 218,000-square-foot complex for $13.5 million a year ago 
and had been looking for a major anchor tenant such as Circuit City to turn the 
ailing center around. Sweetwater fell on hard times when Safeway -- its major 
draw -- left in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Once the supermarket departed, so did customers who were the lifeblood of 
Sweetwater's other retail tenants. Several other tenants also followed suit. In 
the western half of the shopping center, where Safeway had been, 28% of the 
retail space became vacant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vagrants Huddling in Cars 
</P>
<P>
Like falling dominoes, one problem after another hastened Sweetwater's decline. 
By late last year, vagrants were huddling in abandoned cars that littered the 
parking lots. Graffiti stained the buildings, and roofs leaked. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those problems, the Michan brothers believed that Sweetwater 
represented a golden opportunity. Nestled between two major freeways -- 
Interstate 805 and California 54, also known as the South Bay Freeway -- 
Sweetwater occupies a choice piece of real estate in a growing retail sector of 
booming South Bay, Michan said. All it needed, Michan reckoned, was a face lift 
and the right anchor tenant to bring the customers back. 
</P>
<P>
When a Los Angeles-based development firm that had purchased Safeway's lease 
recruited Circuit City, half of the center's problems had been solved. Or so 
the Michans hope. Circuit City opened its doors to customers Aug. 10, and it's 
still too soon to say whether the store can reverse Sweetwater's decline. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the experience of other shopping centers that have leased space to 
Circuit City, the Michans have reason to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"One look at our parking lots once they moved in, and we knew they were 
responsible for a significant increase in customer traffic," said Kris Hoffman, 
president of Albert B. Glickman &amp; Associates, a Beverly Hills real estate 
development and property management firm. The firm is the managing partner for 
Montebello Plaza and Bakersfield Plaza, both of which are 300,000-square-foot 
shopping centers with Circuit City as tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time when we brought in Circuit City, both of the shopping centers were 
more than 10 years old," Hoffman said. "Circuit City gave them both a boost. We 
didn't do any studies, but a seat-of-the-pants impression is that Circuit City 
drew more people than the previous tenants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Anybody Would Be Pleased' 
</P>
<P>
Della Chadwell agrees. She is manager of Huntington Center in Huntington Beach, 
which features a 20,000-square-foot Circuit City store. "It's the heart of our 
lineup," she said. "I think anybody would be pleased with their presence." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics, including some of Sweetwater's other tenants, aren't so sure that 
Circuit City is the long-awaited savior. Some say that signing up a another 
supermarket would have drawn more customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was building a shopping center, I would rather have a supermarket than 
Circuit City," said Gary Fusco, vice president of the Sweetwater Town &amp; 
Country Merchants Assn., which represents most of the center's tenants. 
"Circuit City might bring in somebody from Escondido maybe three times a year. 
But how often do you go grocery shopping? A supermarket would bring in 
customers more suitable for the other tenants, more regulars." 
</P>
<P>
But even Fusco, who operates a Swensen's ice cream parlor and sandwich shop at 
Sweetwater, agrees that bringing in Circuit City is a step in the right 
direction and better, as he put it, than no major tenant at all. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Bilger, a Coldwell Banker commercial real estate broker who specializes in 
retail space, said that just bringing in a successful tenant is not enough to 
keep a center thriving; proper maintenance and security are also imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Circuit City is a big advertising tenant -- they take a lot of ads in the 
paper," Bilger said. "They create a lot of business for themselves and, as a 
result, they'll create more activity for the center. I don't know if Circuit 
City will cure all of Sweetwater's problems, but it's a big step toward solving 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Regarded Chain 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1949, Circuit City has grown to 133 stores in 13 states 
and is commonly regarded as one of the best-run retail chains in the nation. 
Nearly a third of the outlets are in California, including two San Diego County 
stores that opened last month. The other local location is at Midway Drive and 
Rosecrans Street in Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, the Richmond, Va.-based company posted 
revenues of $1.72 billion and profits of $69.5 million, according to company 
spokeswoman Ann Collier. The previous year, the publicly owned firm recorded 
revenues of $1.35 billion and earnings of $50.4 million. The company expects 
20% to 25% growth in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to city leaders, Circuit City will post nearly $20 million in annual 
revenues at the Sweetwater location, twice the amount a successful supermarket 
would generate. 
</P>
<P>
Those expectations account for Michan's confidence that his gamble will pay 
off. To tip the odds in his favor, he and his brothers spent $500,000 to spruce 
up the center's image. The make-over included new lighting, improved 
landscaping, a fresh coat of paint and more visible signs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the center has a history of problems and a negative image to overcome, 
neither of which are quickly erased from shoppers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trickle of Customers 
</P>
<P>
The history began when Safeway decided to leave Sweetwater in 1987 as part of a 
decision to withdraw from the Southern California market. Once Safeway left, 
customer flow at the center slowed to a trickle, causing some retail tenants to 
become "midnight movers," leaving in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those that remained became disgruntled and criticized the center's 
previous owners for failing to quickly recognize the detrimental impact of 
Safeway's departure. Tenants also complained that the shopping center was 
poorly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The center reached its nadir when the members of the Sweetwater Town &amp; 
Country Merchant's Assn. filed a lawsuit in 1987 against the owners, alleging 
poor management. According to Fusco, the group's vice president, some members 
even staged a "tenant strike" and temporarily refused to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
The Michans have installed a powerful lighting system and are adding 
self-illuminating signs to the center. The center is also being repainted in 
lighter colors, said Frank Vogel, the center's property manager. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sophisticated shoppers," Vogel said. "They want to go someplace 
that is clean, secure and attractive. That's what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the transaction, Circuit City was provided 
incentives to move into Sweetwater when a Los Angeles firm that acquired 
Safeway's lease agreed to pay $1 million to finance building improvements, 
including installing a new roof, improving electrical systems and adding a 
3,500-square-foot warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Tenants Attracted 
</P>
<P>
However, Collier, the Circuit City spokeswoman, declined to confirm such 
details, saying the company does not disclose the terms of its lease 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the incentives were well worth it. During its short stay so far, they 
say, Circuit City has not only drawn more customers to the center but has also 
helped recruit new tenants, Vogel said, adding that three of the seven 
vacancies have been filled since Circuit City arrived. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three new tenants is Buhrow Into Dive &amp; Surf, a scuba gear and 
surf shop. For nearly six months, owner Robert Buhrow had been searching to 
relocate from another part of National City. Although he was already leaning 
toward moving into Sweetwater because of its location, he signed the lease when 
he learned that Circuit City would be his new neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the icing on the cake," said Buhrow, who will open his new store Oct. 
1. "Circuit City moving in had a good impact on my decision. It'll draw the 
client that I'm looking for -- young ones that go for the boom boxes . . . 
customers that are a little better on the monetary bracket."

AEROTEST SEES A JUMBO OPPORTUNITY; 
</P>

AGING JETS FUEL GROWING BUSINESS

An Irvine aircraft maintenance firm is trying to break into a burgeoning new 
market by building a $5-million facility near Mojave to recondition aging 
commercial aircraft, including jumbo jets, company officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for a new and emerging industry. . . . We call it the 
independent air-transport maintenance industry," said W.R. Laidlaw, founder and 
chief executive officer of Aerotest Inc., which has made a modest living by 
servicing smaller corporate jets. 
</P>
<P>
The Mojave plant will be the first independent airframe repair facility in 
California and only the fourth in the nation capable of major, nose-to-tail 
overhauls of aging jumbo jets, company officials said. Many airlines operate 
their own modernizing facilities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest officials declined to say if the firm had signed up any customers for 
its new plant, but they said they have had talks with major airlines and cargo 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes more sense . . . to service the needs of a major air carrier or 
carrier family," said Laidlaw, rather than work on several types of aircraft 
for different customers. 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest estimated that demand for rebuilding and modernizing the bodies of 
aging aircraft will increase dramatically in coming years as the number of jet 
transport planes, both passenger and cargo, 20 or more years old rises from 
2,440 in 1988 to 5,731 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand to Increase 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with an expected doubling in demand for jet-transport service, company 
officials said they expect the number of man-hours required each year to 
maintain the world's jet fleet will rise from 89 million in 1988 to 189 million 
by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines and cargo businesses will not be able to keep up with the demand to 
maintain and refit their airplanes, Laidlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it will be a growing business," said Edward J. Starkman, an 
airline industry analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. "You've got a 
capacity pinch in this (aircraft maintenance) business. To the extent they can 
offer a first-rate, certificated program to do this sort of work, it makes 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Attending an Aerotest's press conference on Capitol Hill were several members 
of Congress, including Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), and officials 
of the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses aircraft repair and 
maintenance personnel and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"What Aerotest is doing in California is of great importance," Cox said. "I'm 
very appreciative that investors, management, qualified people in the private 
sector are turning their attention to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Facility at Mojave Airport 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest in June broke ground for a 125,000-square-foot facility, including a 
75,000-square-foot hangar, at the Mojave airport as the first phase of a 
planned $30-million jet-reconditioning facility. Eventually, the company plans 
to build six hangars and other buildings, totaling 500,000 square feet, on a 
39-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The private company, which employs about 200 at existing facilities in Mojave, 
Van Nuys and Irvine, was formed in 1986 and has annual revenue of about $23 
million, said Iain Glendinning, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has concentrated almost exclusively on the maintenance and 
finishing of corporate jets, primarily Gulf Stream aircraft. Last year it 
purchased Western Commander, which operates a Van Nuys aviation services firm 
called the Jet Center. 
</P>
<P>
Glendinning cited three other U.S. firms that either have or are about to 
develop the capability to modernize airframes of jumbo jets. They are the Dee 
Howard Co., which operates a facility in San Antonio, Tex.; Evergreen 
International Aviation, Inc., which owns the Evergreen Air Center in Marana, 
Ariz.; and Tramco Inc. in Everett, Wash.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: DIODES INC. RENEWS TALKS ON POSSIBLE MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diodes Inc., a troubled Chatsworth-based manufacturer of electronic 
semiconductor components, said it renewed talks with Willas Co. Ltd. regarding 
a possible merger or consolidation. In 1986, Diodes and Willas, a privately 
owned Hong Kong electronics firm, agreed in principle for Diodes to acquire 
Willas for undisclosed terms, but the deal was never completed. 
</P>
<P>
David Lloyd, president and chief executive of Diodes, and Lawrence Leung, 
chairman of Willas, said no agreement had been reached, but that they hope to 
decide soon whether a merger is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Diodes reported a loss of $2.9 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, on 
sales of $13.8 million. Willas had sales of $26 million in the fiscal year 
ended March 31.

Delphi Information Systems named Donald L. Lucas as chairman of the Westlake 
Village computer concern, replacing Walter F. Bauer, who retired but remains a 
Delphi director. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer stepped down because he turned 65 and was at the end of a three-year 
contract with Delphi, said Delphi President Richard R. Janssen. Bauer's 
departure was not related to Delphi's recent poor performance, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
Delphi, which sells computer systems to property-casualty insurance brokers, 
lost $710,000 on revenue of $20.5 million in its fiscal year that ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a venture capitalist and a Delphi director since 1983, also is chairman 
of two computer software companies, Oracle Systems and Cadence Design Systems.

TEEN HAS PLENTY OF PHOTOS FROM HIS SOVIET TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After graduating from Mira Mesa High School last June, some of Jason Whaley's 
classmates jumped on the first plane to Hawaii, checked into a cheap hotel for 
a week, and celebrated on the beach until they acquired a glowing, magenta 
sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley eschewed the traditional graduation partying to ride stuffy trains to 32 
cities in 23 days and eat beet soup -- paying $3,300 for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth every penny," said Whaley, 17, an aspiring photojournalist who 
shot 75 rolls of film -- about 2,700 pictures -- during a three-week trip to 
the Soviet Union this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"That camera was like an appendage. Whatever was happening, Jason was always 
right there with his camera," said Bill Melton, head chaperon on the Russian 
excursion that Whaley made with 32 other students from San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was sponsored by People to People, a nonprofit organization founded by 
the U.S. State Department during the Eisenhower Administration to encourage 
international student exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learning-Oriented Trip' 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it wasn't going to be a vacation. I knew it was going to be a very 
vigorous, learning-oriented trip, and I was ready for it," Whaley said. 
</P>
<P>
He prepared not only by reading more than 70 articles written by the State 
Department, but by writing to Kodak, Agfa and Fuji to request film for the 
trip. The latter two sent a total of 45 rolls. 
</P>
<P>
But Minolta came through in the biggest way. After the company president in 
Osaka, Japan, received a letter from Whaley, he agreed to give him a camera, 
lens and motor drive -- about $2,000 worth of equipment -- in exchange for 
publication rights of the photos Whaley shot. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those pictures will appear in the 1990 edition of Minolta Mirror, the 
company's annual international journal of photography. Such exposure will 
somewhat eclipse Whaley's previous career highlight: having pictures published 
in the Mira Mesa Marauder, the high school yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley's group flew from San Diego to New York, then to Helsinki, Finland. They 
then traveled by train to Sochi, a resort town on the Black Sea, where they got 
as crazy as their friends who had gone to Hawaii. They even threw a watermelon 
off the balcony of their 17th-story room just to watch it splatter. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of time, so we did some very American things," Whaley said. 
</P>
<P>
They sobered up quickly, however, when they arrived in Kiev and realized they 
were a mere 60 miles from Chernobyl. Although everyone in the group had read 
about the nuclear disaster there, they were shocked to see how close the plant 
was to the huge city. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first got there, I even considered fasting, but I figured I'd still be 
irradiated from the water," Whaley said, admitting that he was overly concerned 
about radiation poisoning. "Actually, I ended up having some of the best food 
on the trip there. . . . No matter what anyone says about borscht, I think it's 
good." 
</P>
<P>
There were other highlights: a dinner and long visit at the home of a Soviet 
librarian in Kiev, talking politics with members of the city council in Minsk. 
</P>
<P>
Another rare opportunity arose while Whaley walked with friends near Red 
Square. He saw a demonstration being held by members of Hare Krishna and, 
realizing the significance of a religious protest in a communist country, began 
clicking. He told his friends to take the bus back to their hostel; he'd take a 
cab. 
</P>
<P>
While Whaley found the Soviets friendly, easy to talk to and curious about 
American life, it was a different story when he took to the streets with his 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hardest things for me as a photographer was to find someone 
smiling. When I went for my home stay (a visit to a resident's home), the 
librarian told me, 'That's because we have nothing to smile about.' Their 
country is changing rapidly, and they're scared." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whetted His Appetite 
</P>
<P>
Whaley got some of his best shots in Moscow. His favorite, a picture of the 
spiraled towers of St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square rising against a surreal 
gray sky, is the only photo he's printed. Developing the rest of the film may 
take a while for Whaley, who works as a cook. 
</P>
<P>
The trip has merely whetted his appetite for travel. He hopes to attend the 
world-famous Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, then work as a 
photographer for National Geographic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley plans to spend the next two years working in a lab or at a photography 
studio, cleaning floors if has to, to save money to attend Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he's happy to rest on the memories of three weeks in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, this has been the best experience of my life," he said. "I 
don't know when, but someday I'm going to go back."

Police arrested two South Korean film directors and a snake seller in Seoul on 
Monday for releasing snakes into movie theaters showing American films. A 
police spokesman said directors Chung Ji-yong and Chung Hwoe-yong were charged 
with paying a Seoul snake seller nearly $10,000 to release 14 nonpoisonous 
snakes in two theaters in the capital last year to scare audiences away from 
"Fatal Attraction," distributed by Universal International Pictures. The snake 
scare was one of the most graphic of a series of attempts to keep South Koreans 
from seeing films distributed by foreigners. The police said the directors 
belonged to an organization that has staged protests against direct 
distribution of U.S. films. Last month, attackers threw gas bombs into an empty 
Seoul theater where the film "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" was being 
shown. The bombs set chairs on fire and caused damage estimated at $15,000.

Two plays that flopped in New York are delighting critics and audiences at the 
Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. Edward Albee's "The Man Who Had Three 
Arms" and Michael Cristofer's "The Lady and the Clarinet," which were New York 
flops in the early 1980s, have won the Scotsman newspaper's coveted Fringe 
First awards, given weekly to the best of the Fringe's many openings during the 
festival's three weeks. However, not every unsung American play has its 
reputation restored in Scotland. Beth Henley's "The Wake of Jamey Foster," a 
short-lived Broadway entry early this decade, got mixed-to-poor reviews at this 
year's Fringe, and David Rabe's "Hurlyburly," a Broadway success, was denounced 
in the Scotsman as "exploitative, bad-mouthed, and boring." The 422 plays being 
offered in the 43rd annual Festival Fringe include a number of American 
classics and Broadway hits, from "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to more recent 
works, including "Agnes of God" and "Night, Mother." ALEENE MacMINN

Football's Tony Mandarich found a new diversion while waiting out negotiations 
with the Green Bay Packers. The All-American offensive tackle from Michigan 
State made his acting debut on NBC's "Dear John," portraying a football player 
who thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him with recurring character Mike (Sam 
McMurray). Mandarich said the audience laughed at his lines, and the shooting 
went without a hitch. "I've got all this talent that has yet to be exposed," he 
said. A spokeswoman for the show said the 6-foot-6, 315-pound offensive tackle 
was cast by producers who were seeking an imposing and threatening individual 
for the role. The episode is scheduled to air in October. ALEENE MacMINN

CEREBRAL COMEDY REVUE IN 'MENTAL CRUELTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mental Cruelty," at the Tamarind, is one of the brightest sketch comedy revues 
to appear in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The production is a westward expansion for a New York group called Brain Trust. 
Gary Kroeger, formerly of "Saturday Night Live," is the director. 
</P>
<P>
Befitting the name of the group and the title of the show, the comedy here is 
slightly more cerebral than in many of the revues around town. For example, in 
a discussion between a man and a fruit fly about their respective life 
expectancies, the fly casually mentions Mummenschanz, the Swiss performance 
troupe. Other sketches are based on a class called Non-Sequiturs 101 and on the 
spectacle of Roget (as in thesaurus) having trouble finding the right words. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this show is not pedantic. Both of its acts open with timely sketches 
about slipshod professional standards -- among airline pilots and doctors, 
respectively. The first act closes with "Death Gets a Black Eye," co-producer 
Mike Colasuonno's ingenious commentary on Ted Turner's colorization campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the subjects are more conventional. But there isn't a dud in the entire 
show. Kroeger has cut and polished the performances to a fine point. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the performers himself, Kroeger gets to moderate his smart-aleck 
looks in ways that eluded him on "Saturday Night Live." The other men in the 
cast are David Fury, who doubles as the group's most prolific writer (judging 
from the program credits) and co-producer, and Tom Virtue, who wrote his own 
tour de force about a versatile 976 telemarketing entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
The women are Judy Nazemetz, blessed with naturally comic features and voice, 
and long-limbed Sherry Bilsing, who successfully plays against type in a sketch 
about a park bench know-it-all. 
</P>
<P>
"Mental Cruelty" is further powered by Justin Reinhardt's four-man band, the 
Brain Trust Orchestra -- probably the most elaborate musical presentation at 
any comedy revue in town right now -- as well as by adept sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with 
a late show Saturdays at 10 p.m.. Tickets: $10-$12.50; (213) 466-1767.

GERALD WILSON IN CONCERT AT LACMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day shy of his 71st birthday, Gerald Wilson, the Mississippi-born composer 
and band leader, offered an afternoon concert Sunday at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art that was nearly as hot as the mid-day sun. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a youthful and exuberant big band (familiar faces such as 
trumpeter Snooky Young and saxophonist Harold Land Sr., have been replaced with 
"guys ready to move," according to Wilson), the band leader waved the 17-man 
ensemble through an opening set that barely scratched the surface of his 
compositional breadth and scope. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's credits are as profound as his efforts, and an opening "You Better 
Believe It" displayed the late-'40s style he provided for Count Basie that, 
Wilson recalled Sunday afternoon, Basie "made millions off of." 
</P>
<P>
Kicked off at an easy pace, the tune displayed all of the precision swing and 
dynamic variance that the Basie outfit came to embrace. Added features to this 
outing were solos by alto saxophonist Danny House (himself an alumnus of the 
Basie band) and bassist Louie Spears. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson next turned his attention to Duke Ellington, another of the famed band 
leaders for whom Wilson wrote and played, and offered an arrangement of 
"Sophisticated Lady." The familiar melody received unique treatment, becoming a 
great and rousing powerhouse of a vehicle for tenor saxophonist Carl Randall. 
</P>
<P>
Moving forward in music history to the Miles Davis book, Wilson next featured 
the searingly creative trumpet of Oscar Brashear and the trombones of Thurman 
Green and Randy Young on a reading of "Milestones." The tune burned at a 
breakneck tempo provided by bassist Spears and drummer Mel Lee and featured 
some deft piano work by Brian O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
Closing out the set was Wilson's "Blues for Yna Yna," a tune that gained hit 
status by both Stan Kenton and Art Blakey in the early '60s. A waltz, the tune 
loped gently along and displayed Wilson's penchant for dynamic variation. A.

SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH THE LADIES -- BUT NOT QUITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ladies of Jazz. An interesting idea for a concert -- especially on a 
pleasant Sunday afternoon in Barnsdall Park. And free, at that. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation, it was the 
centerpiece in a group of three programs described as the second annual Los 
Angeles International Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't work out quite as advertised, however. Trumpeter/singer Clora 
Bryant, for example, opened the show backed by an all-male ensemble. Not 
another female on stage. The first two numbers, excerpts from a suite dedicated 
to Dizzy Gillespie, allowed plenty of space for Bryant's trumpeting. Curiously, 
it resonated with stronger echoes of Roy Eldridge than Gillespie. Bryant also 
sang effectively, especially on another original, "Ain't No Use." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Gales &amp; Velvet Jazz were the only performers to fulfill the promise of 
the concert's title. Pianist Gales played a conservative role in a strong 
rhythm section that also included bassist Leslie Baker, drummer Andrea Brown 
and percussionist Elmira. But the group's two upfront players -- violinist 
Karen Briggs and guitarist Lady Mac -- were the stars of the day, stealing the 
thunder from the musicians of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Mac ripped off a series of solos that blazed with images of Jimi Hendrix 
and Kevin Eubanks. Briggs was even more arresting. A fine technician, she moved 
beyond an obvious Coltrane influence into a soaring originality that suggested 
the emergence of a potential world class jazz star. 
</P>
<P>
As the concert wound toward its close, the "Ladies of Jazz" premise disappeared 
entirely with the arrival of a bland, all-male fusion band led by saxophonist 
Wayne Wayne. Two numbers later they were joined by blues vocalist Barbara 
Morrison. Her first songs, "My Funny Valentine" and "Don't Explain," revealed a 
sweet voice and a convincing jazz rhythmic sense. But Morrison's move into a 
group of rhythm and blues numbers brought an effective end to the jazz 
proceedings for the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the other programs of the Second Annual Los Angeles International Jazz 
Festival, Larry Gales, Buster Cooper and Sonny Craver were featured on 
Saturday, and Cedar Walton, Charles McPherson, Bill Henderson and the Buddy 
Collette Band showcased the final concert Sunday night. DON HECKMAN

UNINSPIRING INTRODUCTION TO 'BEAUTY QUEENS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no swimsuit competitions or crowns in "The Beauty Queens." Instead, 
the three-part documentary series that begins on the Arts &amp; Entertainment 
cable channel tonight demonstrates how three women -- Helena Rubinstein, 
Elizabeth Arden and Estee Lauder -- helped parlay the "war against ugliness" 
into what today is the $20-billion cosmetics business. 
</P>
<P>
In the first installment (airing at 5 p.m. and again at 9 p.m.), viewers meet 
Rubinstein, a tempestuous entrepreneur who was already czarina of the 
international cosmetics world by the time Lauder was born. Portrayed as a 
would-be scientist who spent as much time in the laboratories as she did buying 
jewels, clothing and now-priceless artwork, Rubinstein started her business 
hawking face cream to British royalty and opened her first salon in London 
during the reign of Edward VII. By the time she died in 1965 at the age of 95, 
the Rubinstein name was on more than 1,000 products and her fortune reflected 
her royal status in the cosmetics arena. 
</P>
<P>
A fascinating story? Perhaps, but not for TV. Endless photographs of her sharp 
profile and tight black chignon, and repeated, irritating snippets of 
Rubinstein being interviewed in French, indicate that this woman's biography 
would best be left as a book. Producer/directors Eila Hershon and Roberto 
Guerra forget to mention that Rubinstein had competition in her field or that 
eventually her label faded away in the all-important U.S. cosmetics market. If 
she originally triumphed over obstacles, they aren't explained here. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of the hourlong program is that it shows that, despite its 
multibillion dollar research-and-development budget, the cosmetics industry 
keeps reinventing the wheel. Rubinstein was promoting the value of Vitamin A 
for youthful skin in the '40s; today it still makes headlines. She was urging 
women to stay out of the sun in the '20s; today the message is the same. When 
she invented waterproof, wand-style mascara in the '50s, who knew it would 
still need to be perfected in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
As part of a trilogy of great women in the beauty world, Rubinstein's story 
could have been remarkable. This version, unfortunately, isn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Arden profile will air Sept. 12 and the Lauder one Sept. 19.

PROBLEMS WITH DIALING 911 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department and the 911 dispatcher involved in the dreadful 
Navarro murders have been getting a lot of flak about what should or should not 
have been done. I think the situation was handled by both the dispatcher and 
Navarro without one element that might have prevented the horrific outcome -- 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the dispatcher suggest that Navarro remove herself from the premises 
or at least ask if Navarro had taken some safeguards to protect herself? Why 
didn't Navarro disband the party? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is hindsight. Certainly, the behavior of the 911 deputy and Mrs. 
Navarro showed no foresight.

I sometimes find it helpful to imagine a reversal of roles in troublesome 
questions relating to gender. Imagine this: The police dispatcher who received 
Maria Navarro's emergency call, the patrol units on call that night and their 
supervisor were all formerly battered women. Now imagine what the response 
would have been.

CONGRESS' IDEA OF DEFENSE: HIDE BEHIND A PORK BARREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Congress returning from summer recess, the American people will soon have 
a chance to judge whether, on defense matters, the House is prepared to behave 
like a responsible democratic institution. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Congress stopped work, Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, drew the obvious conclusion from the sorry performance of 
the House on the military budget bill. "The irrational position," the respected 
Georgia Democrat remarked, "appears to be prevailing on every vote." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not total military spending. White House and congressional leaders 
have agreed to a reduced defense budget of $305 billion. The problem is the way 
the House divvied up the money. 
</P>
<P>
The meat ax was applied to the MX missile, the Midgetman mobile missile 
program, the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But the House action did not free up new resources for schools, highways, 
medical research, housing or other domestic programs. Instead, it shifted 
authority from weapons programs sought by the Administration to other military 
projects that even the Pentagon considers unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
That might have been all right if the congressmen had been pushing an 
alternative strategy of providing for national defense. But they weren't. Their 
motive was pure pork barrel: to provide money for military projects that would 
protect or create jobs in their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said 
that because of improving U.S.-Soviet relations, his colleagues no longer see a 
"downside risk" to voting against strategic weapons programs. More caustically, 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said it was as if House members had "decided 
to give away their overcoats on the first sunny day in January." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence does indicate that the Kremlin, anxious to spend more on the 
crisis-ridden Soviet economy and less on the military, is prepared to reduce 
both conventional and nuclear forces. But these good intentions have not yet 
been nailed down in treaty form. And even if a treaty does halve the strategic 
nuclear weapons on each side, the Soviets will continue to have enormous 
military power that must be prudently, though not extravagantly, balanced on 
our side. 
</P>
<P>
A sensible case can be made for eliminating or reducing one or another of the 
programs slashed by the House -- but not all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Few strategic planners would want to do without an effective bomber force. 
Because they take several hours to reach a distant target, bombers are by 
nature retaliatory weapons that are unsuited to "bolt-from-the-blue" surprise 
attacks. They are, therefore, a stabilizing element in the nuclear balance. 
</P>
<P>
However, the B-2 program has become so expensive that even many bomber 
enthusiasts worry that we can't afford it. Perhaps we could make do with B-1s 
and other, cheaper bombers armed with advanced cruise missiles with 
radar-evading capabilities similar to the B-2. Unfortunately, the House slashed 
funds for the advanced cruise missile program, too. 
</P>
<P>
Then take the House's treatment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
America's silo-based ICBMs are vulnerable to surprise attack by large, more 
accurate Soviet missiles. If an attack seemed imminent, a U.S. President might 
feel impelled to launch first -- a hair-trigger situation that cannot safely be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
One possible fix for the vulnerability problem would be a missile defense 
system, to introduce greater uncertainties into the calculations of any Soviet 
leader who might be tempted by the idea of a knockout blow. But a political 
consensus does not exist for even a limited system. 
</P>
<P>
The other option is to make missiles mobile -- therefore harder to find and 
harder to hit. The Soviets have already deployed two types of mobile ICBMs, but 
their U.S. counterparts are still being debated. 
</P>
<P>
Taken alone, the House vote to chop the funds for putting big MX missiles on 
railway cars was not objectionable; the system would require too much warning 
time anyway. But the House also proceeded to gut the smaller, road-mobile 
Midgetman, which could be quickly dispersed on large military reservations. 
</P>
<P>
If these decisions stand, Congress will be risking a serious deterioration in 
the nuclear balance. Acceptance of such a situation would be foolhardy at any 
time -- but especially while the survival of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies 
remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Senate -- while not accepting the Administration's nuclear 
modernization plan uncritically -- has taken a less frivolous view of its 
responsibilities for national security. But if the House mood prevails in the 
conference committee that begins work this month, a presidential veto will 
surely be in order.

MAN VS. DOG: A BIOETHICAL TRADE-OFF; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL RESEARCH REFLECTS OUR REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERWIN B. NULAND, Sherwin B. Nuland, an associate clinical professor of 
surgery at the Yale School of Medicine, is the author of Doctorsthe Biography 
of Medicine (Knopf, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us old enough to have read newspapers in 1944 still remember the 
excitement that surrounded the announcement of the first "blue-baby" operation 
in November of that year. As the result of experimental surgery on about 200 
anesthetized dogs, researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital had perfected an 
operation to treat a previously lethal heart disease of children. The procedure 
was a giant step toward the modern era of cardiac surgery that has since 
transformed the lives of millions of patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
As astonishing as it may seem, there were organized protests against the 
continuation of the life-saving research. A rapid series of dramatic advances 
by American medical scientists had aroused the ire of a strident group of 
Baltimore animal-rights advocates, or anti-vivisectionists. Over the next few 
years, harassment of laboratory personnel and animal vendors caused increasing 
difficulties in obtaining stray or pound dogs. The anti-vivisectionists 
demanded nothing less than the prohibition of all animal research. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, Baltimore was one of America's great centers of medical progress. 
Faced with the potential tragedy of halting vital work, the Johns Hopkins 
leadership brought the problem to the Baltimore City Council in 1949. Although 
many prominent people came to the public hearings to speak out in favor of 
animal experimentation, the highlight of the deliberations was the dramatic 
testimony of the operation's co-inventor, Dr. Helen Taussig, the world's first 
pediatric cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary woman, as well known for her compassion as for her 
brilliance, did not enter the hearing room alone. She brought with her a joyous 
parade of healthy, smiling, former blue babies for whom animal research had 
provided the gift of life. Many of the children brought along their own pet 
dogs. When an anti-vivisection bill came to a referendum at the next municipal 
election, the people of Baltimore defeated it by a majority of more than 4 to 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years have passed, and the American public is once again being bombarded 
with self-righteous protests against medical progress. Once again, the 
obstructionists are few in number but loud in destructive clamor; once again 
their weapons are half-truths and a disordered perception of morality and 
society's values. 
</P>
<P>
The dangerous campaign being waged by the animal-rights activists is not a 
struggle against medical science alone, it is a struggle against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate question that Americans must answer was framed by Harvard 
physiologist Walter B. Cannon as long ago as 1908, during the first of the 
several periodic revolts against common sense that have imperiled the welfare 
of the sick since that time: "Shall men suffer and die to save the lives of the 
experimental animal, or shall the experimental animals die to mitigate pain and 
wide calamity among men?" 
</P>
<P>
The anti-vivisectionists would have us believe that animal research is no 
longer necessary because it can now be replaced by artificial constructs and 
computer-generated methodology. They insist that this is so, even though the 
better-informed among them must be aware that theNational Research Council has 
spent three years and $315,000 studying whether such a claim has any hope of 
becoming a reality in the foreseeable future. The council's recently released 
report comes to a succinct conclusion: "Animal experiments are still critically 
important to further improvements in medicine and biomedical science." 
</P>
<P>
The report describes contributions that such experiments have made to the 
treatment of patients with polio, AIDS, cardiovascular and kidney diseases and 
psychological illnesses, as well as those who require surgery of any kind, 
particularly organ transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of scientific research were disappointed that the study could not come 
up with evidence that might indicate at least some potential for an early 
decrease in the need for animals. It is well known, anti-vivisectionists to the 
contrary, that most scientists avoid the use of animals whenever possible, if 
for no other reason than the pragmatic one that they are expensive to acquire 
and maintain. 
</P>
<P>
The many splinter groups of anti-vivisectionists go by names as seemingly 
innocuous as the Animal Welfare Institute to appellations that leave no doubt 
about disruptive intentions, such as the Animal Liberation Front. Regardless of 
name or avowed motivation, virtually all the rights groups exist to stop all 
research on animals, whether in one direct legislative action or in a series of 
progressive limitations that eventually will make such studies prohibitively 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is undertaken in the name of some disordered concept of mercy and 
the purported equality of all God's creatures. Deliberately ignored are the 
great gifts that have been made and will continue to be made to the health of 
human beings (and of domestic and farm animals) by research that involves 
animals. Most misguided of all, the activists mistake the Judeo-Christian ethic 
that is the foundation of Western morality. In that ethic, there is no higher 
good than the value we place on human life.

CUBAN IN CONGRESS SPELLS END OF HISPANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Frank del Olmo is a Times editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As near as I can determine, I disagree with almost every political position 
taken by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Cuban-American elected to Congress last week 
from the Miami area. Still, I'm glad the Republican state senator was chosen to 
fill the seat held by the late Rep. Claude Pepper, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
But not because she will increase the seven-member Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus by one and give that group its first woman member and its first 
Republican since Manuel Lujan of New Mexico left Congress to become secretary 
of the interior. In fact, if Ros-Lehtinen is consistent to the extreme 
right-wing positions she took during her campaign, she may even undermine the 
Latino unity that the Hispanic Caucus is supposed to symbolize. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely what I expect her to do. And every time Ros-Lehtinen does 
something that sets her apart from her Latino colleagues in Congress, all of 
them moderate-to-liberal Democrats, it should remind us just how diverse the 
Latino population in this country is. Particular attention should be paid by 
those Latinos who propagate the myth that there is an interest group in this 
nation that can properly be called "Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is rare for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to vote as a bloc on 
anything, unlike the Congressional Black Caucus and several state congressional 
delegations that hang together on issues important to, say, Texas or 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy political milestone the Hispanic Caucus has achieved in the 
13 years since it was founded didn't occur until last year. Then caucus members 
persuaded Congress to expand the nation's annual Hispanic Heritage Week, first 
proclaimed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, to Hispanic Heritage Month. 
(I pause here for the impact of this monumental achievement to sink in.) 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Hispanic Heritage Month runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15. It 
encompasses the dates that mark the independence days of Mexico and several 
Central American countries, as well as the date of Columbus' discovery of the 
New World, celebrated here as Columbus Day and in Latin America as El Dia de la 
Raza, the Day of the New Race. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the members of Congress who pushed this thing through meant well. 
Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente), for example, said he hopes schools, 
colleges, corporations and Latino organizations use the month "to commemorate 
Hispanic culture and achievements." 
</P>
<P>
Fine. But I hope Mexican Americans also use the time to ponder what the term 
Hispanic implies, and why some of us resist using the word. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispanic" has been in the dictionaries for centuries, but first came to be 
widely used in this country in 1970 when the Census Bureau needed a convenient 
term to encompass all people of Latin American extraction living in the United 
States. Since then it has been popularized -- and grossly misused -- by Latino 
activists who adopted the term for blatantly self-serving reasons, foisting it 
on the mass media in the process. 
</P>
<P>
These Latino activists saw themselves as competing with African Americans for 
government services and jobs under antipoverty and affirmative-action programs. 
They adopted a term that lumped Mexican Americans in with Puerto Ricans, Cuban 
Americans and others simply because it increased their numbers and, presumably, 
their clout. 
</P>
<P>
It was a shortsighted strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Even in crass political terms, it was self-defeating. The term Hispanic allowed 
other Latinos to use a large and growing Mexican American population to 
increase their influence. Add up all the Cubans and Puerto Ricans on the East 
Coast, for instance, and they are still outnumbered by all the Mexicans in the 
Los Angeles area alone. 
</P>
<P>
But my concern goes deeper than who is using whom politically. For the term 
Hispanic also casts Chicanos in an erroneous light. It reduces us to just 
another political interest group. We are more than that. 
</P>
<P>
While many Chicanos and other Latinos have been victims of racial 
discrimination similar to that experienced by black Americans, our historical 
experience has been different. Indeed, Mexican Americans are a unique ethnic 
group in this country, neither fully immigrant nor fully native. Some Chicanos 
share the traditional immigrant experience of the Irish, the Chinese and many 
other nationalities that came to this country from abroad, others come from 
families that were here before the first English colonists arrived at Plymouth 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chicano Movement began to assert itself 25 years ago, inspired by the 
civil-rights struggle, Chicano leaders and thinkers began trying to define 
precisely who we are and how we fit into this special country. That profoundly 
important process of self-definition was sidetracked when some of us began 
letting ourselves be called "Hispanic" -- in effect, allowing someone else to 
define who we are. 
</P>
<P>
Having written about this in the past, I know that many Mexican Americans 
disagree with me. I urge them to reply vociferously. We must re-energize the 
process of self-definition that ended so prematurely. By getting the dialogue 
going again, we can at least make Hispanic Heritage Month useful.

DODGERS HANG IN, DEFEAT ASTROS' SCOTT WITH NICKS AND CUTS, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Scott faced the Dodgers in the Astrodome Monday and, after three years of 
accusations, something was finally shown to be scuffed. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Setting aside for a moment their constant griping about Scott's alleged 
scuffing of balls, the Dodgers cut, nicked, and sanded him for six runs in 
seven innings in defeating the Astros, 7-5, before 19,058. 
</P>
<P>
And then they winked. 
</P>
<P>
"If he scuffed it," Dodger starter John Wetteland said, "he was scuffing it 
right out of the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he was still scuffing the ball," said Mike Scioscia, who asked the umpires 
to check three balls. "But there are a lot of different things that happen to a 
scuffed baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Scott was throwing, there were certainly some different things 
happening to it. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, a pitch by Scott left the park. Scioscia hit a three-run 
homer to give the Dodgers a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, a pitch by Scott rolled to the backstop. His wild pitch 
scored Dave Anderson from third to give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead after the Astros 
scored five runs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had not lost to the Dodgers in the Astrodome since Aug. 13, 1986. 
Overall, the Dodgers had only defeated Scott nine times in 25 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't the usual Mike Scott out there," Anderson said. "He got balls up. He 
made bad pitches at bad times. He wasn't putting anybody away." 
</P>
<P>
Some Dodgers wondered if Scott had a sore arm. Others noticed him favoring his 
left leg, which was bothered by a hamstring pull at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine," protested Scott, who lost for the third time in six starts. "You 
live with the forkball, you die with it." 
</P>
<P>
And the Astros are dying with him. This was their 11th loss in 14 games. On 
Aug. 21, they were 1 1/2 games behind the National League West-leading San 
Francisco Giants. Today, they are 6 1/2 back. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also failed to become the league's first 19-game winner, falling to 18-8 
with a 3.15 earned-run average and losing ground in his final-month Cy Young 
duel with St. Louis' Joe Magrane, who also has 18 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan (8-11) won for the second time since the All-Star break with two 
scoreless innings at the right time. He finished his work in the sixth, and the 
Dodgers won it in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Bean, batting .143, started the inning with a single to left against 
Scott. Bean didn't know he'd be playing against Scott until a couple of hours 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't look at it like, 'Oh great, I finally get a chance to play and it's 
against this guy?' " Bean said. "The way I've been going, I'll take an at-bat 
against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
So would Anderson. He was hitting .213 when, after failing twice to bunt Bean 
to second base, he chopped a ball up the middle that advanced Bean, who was 
stealing, to third base. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you call taking something bad and coming out smelling like a 
rose," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The prettiest Dodger sight came next, when Alfredo Griffin laid down a surprise 
bunt to Scott's left. The sore-legged Scott fell as he reached the ball, with 
Bean scoring the tying run and Anderson moving to second. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good play," said Griffin, who had warned Bean to be prepared. "I like 
that play." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson moved to third on Lenny Harris' double play grounder before scoring 
the game-winner on a 1-and-1 inside forkball to Eddie Murray that bounced 
underneath catcher Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you hold onto the forkball too long and you bounce it," Scott 
explained. "That one was really bad." 
</P>
<P>
After Jay Howell's two shutout innings gave him his 26th save, the only thing 
needed from the Dodgers was an explanation of Wetteland's performance. 
</P>
<P>
He had breezed through three hitless innings, striking out five, with only one 
ball leaving the infield. When he entered the fourth, he had struck out 15 in 
his last 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Then he gave up three consecutive singles, a 450-foot homer by Glenn Wilson and 
a homer by Ken Caminiti. Thanks to a new slow curve that proved too slow, 
Wetteland gave up as many homers in a three-batter stretch as he had yielded in 
his previous 81 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw the slow curve for strikes too often," Wetteland said. "It blew up in 
my face." 
</P>
<P>
At least he was rewarded with one of the more stunning sights this Dodger 
season, as Wilson became only the second player to reach the newly constructed 
Astrodome second deck this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit the stuff out of it," Wetteland said. "It was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor reported that his left shoulder felt fine after Sunday's three 
scoreless innings, his first work since July 7. . . . Mike Davis shagged fly 
balls during batting practice Monday and said he would probably ask the Dodgers 
to activate him in a pinch-hitting role this week. Davis hasn't played since 
July 6, having undergone arthroscopic surgery on both knees July 7. . . . Kal 
Daniels, recovering from Aug. 11 knee surgery, shagged fly balls but said he is 
far from full speed. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph was rested Monday, missing only his 11th game this year. He is 
healthy, but this season against Mike Scott he is 0 for 14. . . . On Thursday, 
three days after facing Scott, the Dodgers must face another Cy Young hopeful, 
Cincinnati's Tom Browning. Browning was 6-0 in August with a 1.70 ERA. In his 
last six starts, he has pitched five complete games. . . . Jeff Hamilton's 
eighth-inning double gave him a career-high 30 this season. . . . Eddie Murray 
made two spectacular plays at first base Monday, pouncing on two grounders down 
the line and turning possible doubles into outs. 
</P>
<P>
Murray has not made an error since May 30, in Montreal, a span of 86 games, 
even though during that span he played third base twice. He has committed six 
errors in 137 games. "I've done better," said Murray of his defense, which 
earned him three consecutive Gold Gloves with Baltimore from 1982-84. . . . 
Mickey Hatcher, one of six potential Dodger free agents this winter, said his 
agent, Willie Sanchez, has held discussions with Fred Claire, Dodger vice 
president, and believes an agreement can be reached.

JOE MORRIS, ANDRE TIPPETT LOST FOR THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Morris, whose 1,516 rushing yards led the New York Giants' drive to the 
National Football League championship in 1986, and all-pro linebacker Andre 
Tippett of New England were lost for the season Monday, both victims of the 
league's new injured reserve rules. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, the Giants' all-time leading rusher with 5,296 yards, broke a foot in 
Saturday night's exhibition loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and was placed on 
injured reserve before the team got down to its final 47-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
Tippett, the mainstay of the Patriots' defense, was placed on injured reserve 
after undergoing surgery to repair muscle damage in his right shoulder. Two 
other New England starters, cornerback Ronnie Lippett and defensive end Garin 
Veris, both of whom had knee surgery Saturday, also went on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, none of them can return this season. 
</P>
<P>
Among the players waived Monday as teams cut down the the regular-season limit 
were one-time all-pro wide receiver Cris Collinsworth of Cincinnati and the 
Bengals' 10-year placekicker, Jim Breech, along with six Denver Broncos who 
played key roles on their two Super Bowl teams. Included in that group were 
wide receiver Steve Watson and running back Gerald Willhite. 
</P>
<P>
Another player from those Denver teams, linebacker Ricky Hunley, was cut by the 
Cardinals. Hunley was expected to be Phoenix's starting middle linebacker but 
missed 12 days in a contract dispute and played poorly during the exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City, meanwhile, cut Paul Palmer, its No. 1 draft pick in 1987. Palmer 
was the second-leading rusher and receiver for the Chiefs last year and led the 
AFC in kickoff returns as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Morris and Tippett may have been victims of the new injured reserve rules. 
Brian Washington, who started 14 of 16 games at free safety for Cleveland last 
year, also went on the list with a broken nose and elbow injury; Miami put 
kicker Fuad Reveiz on the list, and Buffalo lost all-purpose running back Robb 
Riddick the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous seasons, when players placed on injured reserve before the 
final cuts could have been activated after six games if healthy, those now 
inactivated before the 47-man limit is established can't be activated during 
the season or practice with the team unless they go through waivers.

IN 9-HOUR MEETING, U.S. PRESENTS JAPAN WITH DETAILED LIST OF PROBLEMS, REFORMS

<P>
Depicting themselves as friends of Japan's consumers, Bush Administration 
officials spent nearly nine hours Monday outlining the most exhaustive list of 
complaints against Japanese business practices that the United States has ever 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
They demanded reforms of systems, regulations, business practices and customs 
that they said impeded imports, kept prices artificially high and even 
restricted leisure and said the United States is prepared to respond, in kind, 
with reforms of its own. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Structural Impediments Initiative negotiations, which will 
continue through next summer, "is a process that is a two-way street and will 
take cooperative efforts on the part of both governments to be a success. Both 
of us have work to do and policy to change. Both sides need to take action and 
take action soon," an American official said. 
</P>
<P>
Success in the talks, he added, "is vital to our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improving Quality of Life 
</P>
<P>
He and three other officials, who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified, said a second day of talks today would be devoted to an airing by 
Japan of its complaints against structural defects in the American economy 
which Japanese officials say are impeding a correction of the $50-billion trade 
imbalance between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
All four U.S. officials described the American demands as designed to remove 
obstacles to access to Japan's market and increase sales of U.S. products -- 
while, at the same time, "improving the quality of life for Japanese consumers" 
by increasing their purchasing power and lowering prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan needs to start giving its consumers a break and become an 'import 
superpower' at the same time," one of the Washington officials said. 
</P>
<P>
With time out only for lunch and coffee breaks, the presentation of American 
complaints started at 9 a.m. and finished after 8 p.m. One of the U.S. 
officials said the actual time spent in discussions was nearly nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington delegation charged, for the first time, that the "government 
sector" in Japan "is beginning to show a substantial and growing surplus" -- 
despite more than a decade of deficits in Japan's national budget. When 
questioned about his remark, the official back-tracked, saying, "We have some 
further work to do with our Japanese counterparts" in defining what is meant as 
a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Competitive Complaints 
</P>
<P>
He complained, nonetheless, that public spending on infrastructure had "fallen 
short in recent years," and said, "Why not channel some of (the) surplus into 
roads, airports, sewers and public parks?" 
</P>
<P>
Another official complained that Japan permitted even anti-competitive 
practices that violate Japanese law, such as bid-rigging and "group boycotts" 
against foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. complaints were leveled against what the Americans regarded as policies 
that prevent land from being made available to housing, public investment and 
business use. "Lack of true competition" in wholesaling and retailing, as well 
as in trucking and air transportation, was criticized. Business practices that 
exclude new firms from entering markets and prevent mergers and takeovers also 
were singled out. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday in Washington, President Bush told Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu 
that the structural talks must produce concrete results by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Kaifu that only by setting up the 
structural talks was the Bush Administration able to prevent Congress from 
taking unilateral action against Japan and said the negotiations must 
demonstrate that problems with Japan can be settled through talks. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, however, replied that the structural problems were "deep-rooted" and 
said he could offer no guarantee of results by next spring, when what U.S. 
officials called an "interim statement" on the negotiations will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
A final report is to be issued next summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Power 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Tokyo said that Kaifu and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will 
seek to postpone promises that could threaten the party's grasp on power until 
after an election is held for the lower house of Parliament, which elects the 
prime minister. It must be called by July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats on July 23 lost an upper house election -- and the 
ability to enact legislation unilaterally -- for the first time in their 
history.

HUNGARY'S STOCK MARKET HAS SAME WOES AS CAPITALIST COUNTERPARTS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each Tuesday at 10 a.m., a group of well-heeled MBA types stroll into a posh 
downtown bank building, take their seats around a wooden table and engage in 
genteel discussion for 40 minutes as they buy greengrocery firms and sell 
chemical companies. 
</P>
<P>
This is Hungary's stock exchange, a fledgling market that poses little threat 
to Wall Street. But the only stock and bond market in the Soviet Bloc suffers 
many of the same ailments -- and then some -- of its big brother exchanges in 
New York, Tokyo and London. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in December, 1987, Hungary's stock market has been buffeted 
by several insider trading scandals, a dangerous drop in prices and sluggish 
trading caused by economic and political instability. 
</P>
<P>
Today, "the main problem is liquidity and lack of buyers," said Tibor Papp, a 
spokesman for the exchange's Securities Trading Committee who admits that 
"things are not moving as quickly as I'd like." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Hungary's stock exchange -- the nominal market for the country's 
$600 million worth of corporate stocks and bonds -- is merely a showcase. Only 
about 5% of all stock trades are conducted at the Tuesday meetings (from a low 
of $161,300 to the high so far of $483,000); the real buying and selling takes 
place throughout the week over the counter in bank offices where up to $9 
million worth of shares are traded weekly. 
</P>
<P>
A typical Tuesday's business is three share transactions and 10 bond deals, 
Papp said. About 60 public limited companies with negotiable shares are listed 
on the stock exchange, and there is also a small but growing bond market with 
about 400 issues. 
</P>
<P>
At some meetings, foreign television crews and observers seem to outnumber the 
traders, who call out bids in a desultory fashion and appear discomfited by the 
scrutiny. And for those used to Western market frenzies, these traders seem 
almost medically sedated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs Good Companies 
</P>
<P>
But this is still Communist Hungary, after all, and full-fledged capital 
markets exist only in the hopeful future. 
</P>
<P>
"The first task is to create companies that are profitable and are good 
investments. It will take time," said George Soros, a Hungarian-born money 
manager in New York who runs the $1.8-billion Quantum Fund there. 
</P>
<P>
Soros recently helped launch the First Hungary Fund, the East Bloc's first 
mutual fund, which aims to raise $50 million to invest in Hungarian firms, a 
much-needed idea in a country where small business loans and credit are 
virtually non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects Hungary's Wall Street experiment to takeoff like Sputnik. 
Financial experts both inside and outside the country say it will take several 
years for the exchange to mature and will depend on how successfully Hungary 
can privatize its state-owned firms and create the infrastructure for a market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen sweeping change: New laws encourage Western-style 
commercial banks and allow private Hungarian firms to hire up to 500 employees. 
Foreigners may buy Hungarian firms, and anyone may raise capital by issuing 
shares. In addition, Hungary has introduced bankruptcy laws and has started 
taxing its citizens, in part by employing the East Bloc's only value-added tax. 
</P>
<P>
But Hungary's financial leaders also realize that passing laws is only half the 
battle -- implementing them is much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
And the stock market's growth is hampered by the fact that Hungary is an odd 
mingling of capitalist and socialist economies. For instance, the forint, which 
has been devalued by 11% in the past year, remains a non-convertible currency. 
</P>
<P>
For investors who want to repatriate their earnings, "that is certainly a major 
problem," said Andrew Sarlos, a Hungarian-born money manager based in Toronto 
who co-founded the First Hungary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
So is the typical Hungarian prospectus, which runs six pages but does not 
include any of the hard facts that Westerners demand. Another problem is 
converting arcane Hungarian accounting practices to generally accepted Western 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Before News 
</P>
<P>
Then there is insider trading, which Hungary's stock market mavens view with 
less concern than their Western counterparts. "We have a small market and with 
insider trading, at least it's trading. If we put too many rules, it will kill 
the market," Papp said. 
</P>
<P>
He won't get specific but says that in several cases employees with inside 
information bought company stock the day before directors announced news that 
drove up the price. 
</P>
<P>
No action was taken because Hungary has no law to prohibit such actions. 
Parliament, however, is expected to pass a comprehensive Stock Exchange and 
Securities Act this November that would squelch insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll feel much more secure when we have securities laws," Papp said. "If 
companies go bankrupt and investors lose money, it could halt the market. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal is selling state factories to foreign investors who would then 
issue and trade stock on the Hungarian Stock Exchange. But sometimes, the 
government cannot determine who owns the firms and is authorized to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, there are no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if they didn't put so many dogs on the market they'd have better luck," 
said one Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Faster Growth 
</P>
<P>
Hungary had a lively stock exchange from 1861 until 1948, when the country's 
new Communist rulers closed it down. 
</P>
<P>
But Hungary, which led the East Bloc in economic reform under longtime leader 
Janos Kadar's "goulash Communism," opened a small bond market in 1983. It has 
grown steadily, and the new laws will only accelerate that growth. 
</P>
<P>
The First Hungry Fund is the brainchild of Soros and Sarlos, who have retained 
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the New York-based brokerage, to market the fund. 
Other key players are the private sector arm of the World Bank and Hungary's 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
Small investors need not apply. Investors are asked to contribute $500,000 for 
five years and are guaranteed that they can recover their initial investment 
after five years -- in hard currency. Most will probably come from outside 
Hungary. Inside, many residents harbor a distrust of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds Almost Crashed 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason. The 1987 Wall Street debacle caused dangerous waves on 
the Budapest exchange and prompted many Hungarian investors to sell their 
stock, Papp said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bond market almost crashed in late 1987. Hungary's money 
managers had sold tens of millions of dollars in bonds to citizens at fixed 
rates of 11%, a good buy when Hungary's inflation rate was 6%. But when 
inflation soared unexpectedly to 17%, the state was forced to step in and 
repurchase many of its bonds to keep the market from collapsing. Today, the 
bonds are still 20% off of their face value. 
</P>
<P>
But lured by new business, a number of Western companies have jumped into the 
financial fray. The Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. accounting firm is advising 
Hungarian firms on investment prospectuses and Western auditing practices. 
Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., which expects to open a Budapest office this fall, 
has entered into a joint venture with five commercial banks to provide 
accounting and financial consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Soros, the savvy, high-profile money manager who has poured millions of his own 
money into promoting Hungarian political reform, cautions that reforms should 
move slowly or the entire house of Magyar cards may collapse. 
</P>
<P>
While an ardent champion of his homeland, Soros hesitates when asked whether he 
would sink his own money into shares traded on the Hungarian Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to look very closely before I did."

KAIFU WOOS U.S. PUBLIC TO SOOTHE TRADE IRRITATION; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER DELIVERS FAMILIAR MESSAGE DURING HIS VISIT TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reached out to mainstream America like a 
politician on the stump, tossing out the first baseball at Fenway Park, pumping 
the flesh at Plymouth Rock, and visiting prestigious universities. 
</P>
<P>
By appearances, the essence of his diplomatic initiative was to restore good 
feelings in what might be called the world's most antagonistic friendly 
alliance, bar none. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the trade imbalance hovering stubbornly above $50 billion a year 
-- in Japan's favor -- economic tension has tended to overshadow the positive 
side of the relationship, particularly where strategic security ties are 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
But if there was a substantive message in Kaifu's visit, which took him to San 
Francisco, Washington and Boston before he departed Monday for Mexico City, it 
was a familiar one, espoused by a succession of Japanese prime ministers: that 
both sides must make efforts to resolve trade problems, and that Japan will, as 
always, attempt to boost imports. 
</P>
<P>
"We must try to be an import superpower," Kaifu told a news conference 
Saturday, echoing a phrase used by President Bush in their meeting the previous 
day. He added that Japan must import more "not simply because we are being 
asked to do so by the United States, but because it will help raise our quality 
of life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Say 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kaifu, 58, who assumed office less than a month ago amid domestic political 
turmoil to become Japan's third premier since May, revealed nothing new in the 
way of concrete measures or policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no substance to it. . . . Kaifu has nothing to say," observed a 
veteran Japanese reporter accompanying the prime minister's entourage. "This 
won't fly back home -- the Japanese people are not going to be fooled." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, however, the gap between style and substance has far more to do 
with the constraints of the institution of the prime minister's office than 
with Kaifu's aptitude as a statesman. Never a chief executive like the U.S. 
president or a shaper of administrative policy like some European prime 
ministers, for the past four decades the Japanese prime minister has been at 
best an arbiter among rival factions of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- 
the first among equals in an obscure game of inside baseball, a fulcrum for 
consensus building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bureaucrats Rule 
</P>
<P>
It is the elite cadres of the bureaucracy that set the course and control the 
pace of change in Japan's foreign and domestic policies, with varying degrees 
of input from the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the prime minister nor the prime minister's office are policy-making 
bodies," said Chalmers Johnson, a professor of political science at UC San 
Diego's Institute of International Relations and Pacific Studies. "They 
basically reign over the political system, allowing the bureaucrats to rule." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kaifu's reputation as a skilled orator, Foreign Ministry officials 
essentially drafted the cautious speeches and remarks he was to deliver during 
his 10-day tour of the United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
What Kaifu contributed were the rhetorical flourishes and the personal touches. 
In San Francisco, for example, Kaifu recalled with nostalgia the almost 
childish thrill he felt when 27 years ago he fulfilled his "dream of driving an 
American car on the roads of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
In his major speech before the National Press Club in Washington, the prime 
minister of Japan lapsed into a maudlin tale of how his mother once gave him 
encouragement after he failed a junior high school entrance examination. He 
also waxed nostalgic over receiving chewing gum and chocolate from American GIs 
as a young boy during the occupation era. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to give a face to Prime Minister Kaifu and also to give a face to 
Japan," said a Foreign Ministry official. "He wants to build trust by 
explaining to the American public the thinking of the faceless, inscrutable 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Kaifu's pledge to make Japan an "import superpower," and by 
implication break down the structural characteristics of Japan's distribution 
system and corporate culture, which critics allege retard market access by 
foreigners, it appears unlikely he will be able to deliver any concrete action. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration asked Kaifu for tangible signs of progress by next 
spring in the Structural Impediment Initiative consultations that began Monday 
in Tokyo. Kaifu gave no assurances other than to say both sides should make 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Japanese Dan Quayle' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the propaganda of the Foreign Ministry, we have no indication that 
this guy is competent," said Johnson, the UC San Diego political scientist. 
"The things that need to be done in Japan, he's not capable of doing. He's a 
seat-warmer, a flunky. He's a Japanese Dan Quayle." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kaifu's status is hinged on a fluid domestic political situation, which 
undermines his already weak position as a vaguely empowered leader of 
government in the Japanese mold. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, Kaifu was chosen by Liberal Democratic Party elders -- under 
the pretext of a pro forma party caucus election -- to succeed Sosuke Uno, the 
former foreign minister who resigned to take responsibility for the ruling 
party's stunning defeat in the July 23 election for the Upper House of 
Parliament. Uno was embroiled in a sex scandal that compounded the public's 
furor over political corruption and an unpopular consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, was forced to resign in May because of his 
role in the Recruit Co. bribery affair, which also tainted the names of former 
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and nearly every top leader in the party. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not he is a caretaker prime minister manipulated from behind the 
scenes by Takeshita and other disgraced party bosses, as many knowledgeable 
observers suggest, Kaifu's paramount job is to restore confidence in the 
beleaguered ruling party and lead it through general elections expected to be 
held as early as later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, his wooing of the American public seemed designed for domestic 
Japanese consumption, much as his warm welcome by the Bush Administration 
appeared intended to help shore up the Liberal Democrats' defenses against the 
ascendence of the Japan Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Curious Mixture 
</P>
<P>
He will need all the help he can get. An opinion poll conducted by Jiji Press 
shortly after Kaifu took office suggested that his Cabinet had only a 27.5% 
approval rating, the second lowest ever recorded by the agency for a new 
administration. The lowest rating went to Uno, Kaifu's immediate predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kaifu's performance on foreign soil, highly scrutinized in Japan for 
traces of charisma and leadership, has displayed a curious mixture of genuine 
spontaneity and wooden ritual. He joked about his predilection for polka-dot 
ties with President Bush and tried his hand at horseshoes during his brief stop 
at the White House. But intimacy and warm feelings were part of the advance 
script, long before the two men ever met and had an opportunity to determine 
whether they felt personal rapport. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to conduct talks with the President as if I were meeting an old 
friend," goes the advance text of Kaifu's departure remarks from the White 
House, handed out hours before Friday's summit began. 
</P>
<P>
Bush broke away from his vacation in Kennebunkport, Me., to meet Kaifu in the 
formal setting of Washington, in sharp contrast with his reception of Canadian 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who showed up at the Bush summer home wearing a 
sweater. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kaifu scored points for his wife, Sachiyo, an outgoing and charming First 
Lady who breaks the mold of the demure and invisible Japanese woman. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, where more than 800 people purchased $75 dinner tickets to 
hear Kaifu speak at the Fairmont Hotel, Kaifu's oratorical skills were filtered 
through a mumbling interpreter, evoking unenthusiastic applause and some 
stifled yawns. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded to me like a lot of rhetoric," said an American executive of a 
Japanese-owned computer company in San Bruno, Calif. "I suppose I was surprised 
he even mentioned there was trade friction in the U.S-Japan trade relationship, 
but he didn't seem to be dealing head on with any of the issues. I don't think 
we can look to Mr. Kaifu for many changes back in Japan."

Half of Fired Employees Sue: Half of the employees fired by their employers for 
any reason sue for damages, leading to discharge settlements of between $10,000 
and $100,000 nearly 40% of the time, a new survey said. The survey also found 
that a majority of U.S. executives believe that substance abuse is the nation's 
primary labor and employment problem. The survey, conducted by the law firm of 
Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler &amp; Krupman, polled 1,014 industrial relations 
executives at Fortune 500 and small- and medium-sized companies in the public

Vietnam Sets Up Import-Export Bank: Vietnam has established an import-export 
bank financed by shareholders, according to Radio Hanoi. The initial capital of 
the Vietnam Export-Import Bank is $28 million, divided into 250,000 shares. The 
bank was described in the broadcast as "a partnership corporation doing 
business in money and credit and providing banking services to serve 
production, processing of export goods and export-import activities." 
Shareholders can pay in Vietnamese or foreign currencies, precious metals or 
stones, or in merchandise qualified for export. Vietnam is expanding its 
economic ties with Western and non-communist Asian nations and is trying to 
attract foreign investors to stimulate its poor economic performance.

GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER TEAMS WITH BELGIAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher has formed an alliance 
with a Belgian law firm, positioning itself to take advantage of business 
opportunities stemming from the planned 1992 economic unification of Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Under an informal partnership agreement, Gibson Dunn will cooperate on legal 
matters and share personnel and technology with the Brussels-based firm of Van 
Bael &amp; Bellis. The Belgian firm plans to establish operations near the 
Tokyo and Hong Kong offices of Gibson Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles firm, in turn, plans to open a Brussels office. Gibson Dunn now 
has offices in London, Paris and 13 other cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Such Union 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will enable Gibson Dunn to expand its European presence "at a 
time when the development of the single European market is presenting many of 
our clients with unprecedented challenges and opportunities," said Norman B. 
Barker, chairman of the management committee at Gibson Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance is at least the second informal union involving large Los Angeles 
and European law firms in 1989. The Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &amp; 
Myers in May forged a working relationship with Macfarlanes, a London-based 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson Dunn provides legal corporations and banks legal services for matters 
relating to finance, litigation, employment and tax law. The firm had $236 
million in revenue in 1988, making it the fourth-largest law firm in the United 
States.

IACOCCA TO QUIT JOB AS CHRYSLER CEO IN 1991

<P>
Chrysler Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Lee A. Iacocca, who brought the 
nation's third-leading car maker from near bankruptcy to financial health, has 
decided to step down when his contract expires in 1991, the New York Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca, in an interview last week, told the Times that he plans to devote more 
time to improving the nation's education system and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
He said he might stay on in some role but would give up his chief executive job 
when his four-year contract runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to be the guy who pushes the buttons and runs things," he told 
the newspaper, adding that he "might stay behind to help, but in a lower 
profile, on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said the comments did not constitute a formal retirement announcement, 
which would first be made to company directors and employees. 
</P>
<P>
After joining the company in 1978, Iacocca, 64, became one of America's most 
recognizable business executives, appearing on Chrysler television commercials 
and writing two best-selling books. 
</P>

A federal grand jury is investigating allegations against a Boeing Co. division 
and at least one mid-level company official of overcharging the Air Force 
millions of dollars, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that Boeing Military Airplanes of Wichita overcharged 
the Air Force $11 million during the past decade on contracts to replace the 
aluminum skins of KC-135 transports and refueling tankers, the Wichita Eagle 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Because the five-year statute of limitations expired on some of the contracts, 
the felony criminal investigation is limited to alleged overcharges of $3 
million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department is considering civil action to try to reclaim all $11 
million, according to Defense Department sources who requested anonymity, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Cooperating 
</P>
<P>
Any convictions could result in a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in 
prison and $500,000 in fines. The company could be fined $1 million in addition 
to repayment of overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Defense Department sources as alleging that the Boeing 
division charged the government 12% to 13% more for aluminum than it was paying 
its suppliers, a markup not allowed under such military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Military spokesman Richard Hill said the company has been cooperating 
fully with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues pertain to the pricing of certain raw materials used in the 
performance of the contracts, and it involves complex regulatory and accounting 
principles," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to explain Boeing's position further. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors plan to present a draft indictment to the grand jury before 
the statute of limitations expires early next month, the Eagle reported.

STAR-KIST TO FUND RESEARCH TO LOWER DOLPHIN KILLINGS

H. J. Heinz Co. subsidiary Star-Kist Foods announced a plan to fund research to 
reduce the number of dolphins killed in tuna fishing nets just days before 
animal rights activists plan to protest the company's alleged involvement in 
dolphin killings. 
</P>
<P>
Star-Kist spokesman Erik Bloemendaal said last week's announcement of the 
research funds was unrelated to a protest scheduled to take place Wednesday 
before Heinz's annual meeting in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Steiner, director of the Save the Dolphins Project at Earth Island 
Institute in San Francisco, which organized the protest, called the research 
project "a public relations scam." 
</P>
<P>
The institute claims that Star-Kist purchases tuna caught by encirclement nets 
that each year needlessly kill 100,000 dolphins. The group said it targeted 
Star-Kist because it is the world's largest tuna processor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Cite Cost 
</P>
<P>
Heinz has studied the possibility of funding research by the World Dolphin 
Research Society since the beginning of the year, but had not determined all 
the details until recently, Bloemendaal said. 
</P>
<P>
The research is intended to develop acoustic and electromagnetic signals to 
calm dolphins and guide them out of the nets. 
</P>
<P>
The World Dolphin Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded two 
years ago by the Aspen Research Institute of Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Bloemendaal declined to say how much the company will spend for the research, 
but called it "a significant amount."

POST OFFICE, MCA PLAN STAMP-MOVIE PROMOTION; 
</P>
<P>
ADS FOR DINOSAUR ISSUE WILL MENTION 1988 FEATURE FILM 'LAND BEFORE TIME'

The U.S. Postal Service will help a movie company push sales of its latest 
video release by offering its newest series of stamps as a promotional tool. 
</P>
<P>
In the first marketing venture between the post office and a private company, 
the agency will mount a multimillion-dollar ad campaign that simultaneously 
promotes the stamps depicting dinosaurs and MCA Inc.'s video release of "Land 
Before Time," a 1988 feature film about a dinosaur. In turn, the home-video 
division of MCA, the parent of Universal Pictures, will promote the movie and 
the stamps in its own ads 
</P>
<P>
The four new dinosaur stamps themselves won't carry advertising for the movie; 
they were created before the Postal Service and MCA agreed to the 
cross-promotion this summer. But the agency will tell consumers about the movie 
in its television and magazine ads and has given MCA permission to use its 
eagle logo and facsimiles of the stamps in MCA's advertising for "Land Before 
Time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Stamp Sales 
</P>
<P>
In addition, MCA will provide buttons to Postal Service employees that show the 
stamps with the movie's main character, an animated dinosaur named Littlefoot, 
and will place promotional material in about 30,000 post offices around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service won't receive any of the proceeds from sales of the 
videocassettes or from MCA's use of its stamps and logo, said a spokesman. 
Instead, the tie-in is designed to increase sales of the dinosaur series during 
National Stamp Collecting Month. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is, the more stamps we sell the longer we can go between rate 
increases," said Peggy Grant, general manager of the service's philatelic 
marketing division. Postmaster General Anthony Frank said recently that 
first-class postage could be raised to as much as 32 cents to cover a projected 
$1.5-billion deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service's recent efforts to engage the private sector to help it cut 
costs has met with controversy. In June, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. kicked the 
Postal Service out of 11 Sears stores in the Midwest after the American Postal 
Workers Union charged that Sears employees were running "mini-post offices" in 
the stores. And earlier this year, several companies complained that the 
service violated federal contract-bidding procedures by hiring Texas 
billionaire H. Ross Perot as a consultant. The contract with Perot was 
eventually nullified. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional staff member familiar with the Postal Service's operation said 
the MCA advertising tie-in raised questions about the service. "I don't know 
how or where they're going to draw the line on something like this," said the 
staff member, who asked not to be identified. "The Postal Service issued a Lou 
Gehrig stamp; does that mean someone marketing a baseball movie is going to get 
a tie-in too? I don't know whether deals like this make sense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Formal Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Laurence, an editor of Linn's Stamp News, a stamp collectors' 
publication, said: "Anything that brings stamp collecting to the attention of a 
broader audience is a good thing. Everyone in the stamp collecting community 
wants to sell his stamp collection eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said the Postal Service has no formal guidelines for establishing 
commercial tie-ins and is considering other ventures. "We just thought (the 
movie) had a nice appeal and it was a good fit" with the dinosaur stamps. She 
added that there has been very little criticism for the MCA venture so far.

Reporting plunging profits, Sweden's troubled auto maker and aircraft 
manufacturer Saab-Scania AB confirmed Monday that it is in negotiations with 
Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Georg Karnsund, Saab's chief executive, refused to disclose details of the 
talks, saying the two companies had signed an agreement of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
He said Saab also is talking with other car makers, but he refused to say which 
ones. Karnsund said Saab has signed a secrecy agreement only with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have circulated for months that Sweden's aviation pioneer was bidding to 
sell its ailing car division, where falling sales caused a drop in income per 
share of nearly 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Jan-Erik Larsson, head of the car division, has said Saab "will remain a 
Swedish auto-making company," indicating that a full buyout is not being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
The profit at Saab's car division plunged 30% in the first six months of the 
year to $139 million, partly because of a 15% drop in U.S. sales, the company 
said.

STUDENTS, STUDENTS EVERYWHERE AND NARY A PLACE TO SIT; 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL TRICK IS FINDING MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenge for school administrators in coping with growing enrollment is 
not to accurately project class sizes so they can plan, on paper, enough 
schools to accommodate the incoming students. 
</P>
<P>
The tricky part is finding the money to pay for new schools -- which cost from 
$10 million to upward of $30 million each, depending on the grade levels they 
will serve. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional source for the bulk of school construction money has been 
property taxes and contributions from the state. But Proposition 13's passage 
11 years ago effectively shut down that as a major source of funds, and the 
state's kitty for school construction money is flat busted. 
</P>
<P>
A number of school districts in San Diego County are successfully pursuing a 
type of school financing called Mello-Roos, which essentially is a bond 
authorized by landowners rather than voters. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mello-Roos, if a particular land area has fewer than 10 registered voters 
-- such as a large, undeveloped tract of property -- the property owners 
themselves can approve the bond measure and promise to repay the 
</P>
<P>
indebtedness through tax assessments on their property. Developers, however, 
pass that tax debt on to the homeowners who will buy the property and homes 
they are developing, thereby effectively passing on to future residents the 
cost of providing schools for their children. A homeowner knows, going into his 
purchase, that he faces the additional tax. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the school district will not authorize sale of the bonds until a 
certain percentage of the homes are purchased, and then use that revenue to 
build the schools needed to serve those new neighborhoods. Some districts -- as 
was the case last year in Carlsbad -- negotiate with the developer to pay the 
bond debt up front so school construction can begin that much sooner. The 
developer then gets reimbursed when he sells the homes in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts don't have the opportunity to pursue Mello-Roos financing, 
however, because there are no large tracts of undeveloped land within their 
district to tap as a bond-repayment source, and Mello-Roos isn't feasible on 
smaller developments. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts, if they have the support of the city councils that approve 
new, large developments, sometimes win negotiated settlements directly with a 
developer to donate a land site or, better yet, fund the construction of entire 
schools as a condition of the approval of their development by the council. 
</P>
<P>
That has occurred in the San Dieguito High School District, which, with the 
cooperation of the San Diego City Council and the two major builders of North 
City West, got more than $30 million from the developers to pay for a new high 
school, said Eric Hall, director of administrative services for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos Unified School District won a similar agreement with a builder 
developing a large, master-planned development near Palomar College who 
promised to pay for a new elementary school out of his pocket to serve his new 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps to have a City Council on your side," said San Marcos Supt. Mac 
Bernd. "Our city fathers are buffeted by a lot of competing interests, but 
schools are very important to them and they're doing all they can (with 
developer agreements imposed by City Hall) to assist us. Ours is a City Council 
that realizes that the infrastructure of a community goes beyond roads and 
sewers and water mains and fire stations, and includes schools as an essential 
part of a community." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast in neighboring Escondido, the City Council has pursued no such 
agreements with builders, and, in fact, ordered the school district to pay for 
much of the public works improvements before it approved the construction of a 
new campus at Kit Carson Park. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos Unified School District found yet another way to finance an 
elementary school that opened last year: It sold certificates of participation 
through a brokerage house -- private bonds to investors that will be repaid as 
other developer-impact fees trickle into the district. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an expensive way to go because of the interest rates and brokerage fees 
we have to pay, but it got us the money we needed at the time we needed it to 
build a school," said Jeff Oken, facilities administrator for the district. 
"The school district is the guarantor of the bonds, and we're counting on 
developer fees to keep coming in to repay them." 
</P>
<P>
In Carlsbad, a new elementary school completed two years ago was financed 
through developer-impact fees collected over many years, and the kitty was 
virtually drained, said Georgiana Kirby, manager of information systems for the 
Carlsbad Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Another new elementary school, scheduled to open in 12 months, was financed 
through Mello-Roos bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad needs to build six more schools -- and is hoping to work a deal with 
the city, now under study, in which a citywide assessment district will be 
established to generate construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Solana Beach Union (elementary) School District is counting on developer 
contributions to finance the two schools it hopes to build -- one to serve 
Fairbanks Ranch, the other for North City West. 
</P>
<P>
"A developer donated a 10-acre site in Fairbanks Ranch, and we're hoping we can 
apply that as our contribution so we can get the equivalent in matching funds 
from the state to help pay for the school," said Supt. Raymond Edman. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, though, is that the state is broke and faces a backlog of more 
than $7 billion in requests for help to build new schools throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Already, districts are queuing up to tap $1 billion in state funds that they 
hope will be made available if Sacramento authorizes -- and voters approve -- a 
bond measure next year. 
</P>
<P>
While the state may have been considered for years as the bail-out funding 
source for local school districts, voter sentiment and legislation in 
Sacramento has undermined school districts in more recent years, school 
officials complain. 
</P>
<P>
The single worst blow was the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, which limited 
the increase of property taxes that had been a major source of school 
construction money and that required a two-thirds voter approval for bond 
measures -- a threshold that few districts can meet. 
</P>
<P>
State law was changed several years ago and aggravated the problem. Prior to 
the law, a city council or county board of supervisors, on behalf of school 
districts, could assess whatever level of builder fees it wanted on new 
construction to help finance new schools, and some districts were able to 
collect upward of $4 on every square foot of new residential construction -- 
enough money to pay for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
The state put a $1.57-per-square-foot limit on that developer-impact fee, 
however -- and now, every time a new home is approved for construction, 
districts receive less than half the amount of money needed from that home to 
provide school housing for those residents. With every new home built, then, 
districts are falling further behind in paying for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
The law change also affected a school district's right to tell a city or county 
that there is no school space available to serve a new development. Without the 
assurance from a school that it could properly house new students, the 
municipality or county in the past could reject new development. But the new 
law forbids that protocol, saying that the schools effectively were making 
land-use decisions on the basis of whether school classrooms were available. 
</P>
<P>
Now a developer can build his homes without regard to the availability of 
classroom seating to serve the new residents, and homes are being built with no 
guarantee that the residents' children will have a place to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
There is proposed additional legislation in Sacramento that will strike another 
blow against schools. The proposed law by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) 
would prohibit cities and counties from practicing their current option of 
requiring developers to build schools as a condition of receiving zoning or 
general plan amendments that would allow those new developments. 
</P>
<P>
If that law were already in effect, the developers of North City West and in 
San Marcos, for instance, could not have been required to fund new schools 
there -- even though they were willing to as the cost of doing business and 
providing classrooms for newcomers to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Robinson of the county's Office of Education suggests that dramatic changes 
in law will be needed to give school districts a better future. 
</P>
<P>
"We will live or die on the acceptance of continuing the philosophy of Prop. 
13," he said. A bill that would amend that state constitutional amendment has 
been proposed, he noted, "but it will be a very difficult task for it to be 
approved." 
</P>
<P>
"So right now, we're all hanging our hats on a billion-dollar bond measure next 
June," he said. And even that would only be a Band-Aid fix. 
</P>
<P>
The other options still remain: Mello-Roos financing, developer contributions 
and year-round schools and double sessions, where half of a school's student 
population attends classes starting in the early morning and the other half 
stays in school until late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GROWING AND GROWING 
</P>
<P>
The following is a list of some of the fastest-growing school districts in San 
Diego County, showing the number of students who were enrolled 10 years ago, 5 
years ago, last year and this year, and a projection to the year 2000.

FESTIVITIES MARK L.A.'S BIRTHDAY AND LABOR DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With much of Southern California basking on the beaches and relishing Labor Day 
barbecues, hundreds of Los Angeles residents spent Monday celebrating a 
different kind of holiday amid a festive display of 18th-Century tradition and 
modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
As Mayor Tom Bradley sang an off-key rendition of "Happy Birthday," the city of 
Los Angeles celebrated the 208th year of its founding with daylong ceremonies 
at the downtown Olvera Street Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
On hand for the celebration were descendants of the city's 11 founding families 
and their soldier escorts who first made the journey from the San Gabriel 
Mission and established the historic site of El Pueblo de la Reina de Los 
Angeles on Sept. 4, 1781. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Journey 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has since grown to become the nation's second-largest city with a 
population of more than 3.4 million, and more than 50 people who trace their 
ancestry to the founding families -- or Los Pobladores -- repeated that 
nine-mile trek Monday in what has become an annual journey. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a sense of pride," said Robert Lopez, 68-year-old president of Los 
Pobladores 200 who described himself as a seventh-generation descendant of Luis 
Quintero, one of the city founders, and Roque Cota, one of the soldiers who 
escorted the original group of settlers. 
</P>
<P>
"To think that one of your ancestors owned one-eleventh of all of Los Angeles 
is something to think about," Lopez said, "although there wasn't much to own 
back then." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who greeted the first Spanish arrivals more than two centuries ago 
were the Gabrielino Indians, a local tribe that called the village of Los 
Angeles by their own name of Yang-Na. And, they too, were represented Monday by 
an elderly couple in traditional Indian dress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One of the Few Recognitions' 
</P>
<P>
"This celebration is one of the few recognitions we've had in 200 years," said 
Vera Rocha, 60, as she clutched a handful of crow feathers for spiritual 
strength. "Our people were lost in the missions, and we lost our identity. . . 
. We were a lost people." 
</P>
<P>
Her 65-year-old husband, Manuel, agreed. "We are here so people won't forget 
about (the Gabrielinos)," he said. "This is a very important day for all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
For many in the crowd, it was a day of blending old-style culture and high-tech 
wizardry as costumed actors portrayed life in 18th-Century Los Angeles as 
nearby Los Angeles city firefighters demonstrated a high-rise rescue. Singing 
groups and dance troupes performed to historical Latin American music, while a 
team of city helicopters flew overhead in formation. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of Southern California, however, Labor Day involved a more 
traditional celebration as the summer's final long weekend drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of sunny skies, temperatures in 
the 80s and two- to three-foot waves to jam local beaches, but lifeguards 
reported only a moderate number of rescues. 
</P>
<P>
In Hermosa Beach, Lifeguard Capt. Steve Voorhees said about 300,000 people were 
at beaches from Playa del Rey to Cabrillo Beach with few incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In Marina del Rey, a flotilla of motorboats, sailboats and fireboats surrounded 
two tall ships as they sailed into the harbor Monday as part of a festival 
celebrating trading vessels that used to ply ocean waters in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 onlookers on land also watched as the brig Pilgrim and Witch of Wood 
arrived on the first leg of the Tall Ships Festival that will run this month 
along California's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
And on a day when freeways were flowing freely, one of the biggest traffic jams 
was around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where thousands of football fans 
spent their Labor Day at the season opener between USC and the University of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
But on this holiday, it was not all cheers for the local team and the birthday 
city. 
</P>
<P>
A West German couple, on their first visit to America, had just arrived in Los 
Angeles Monday from Northern California and, as they walked the downtown 
streets, Holger Haertling and his wife, Monika, remained unimpressed. "I have 
to tell you," Haertling said, "I still like San Francisco better."

UMW LEADER ASSAILS 'ANTI-WORKER' STANCE OF BUSINESS IN '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Trumka, president of the embattled United Mine Workers Union, said 
Monday that organized labor's mission in the 1990s should be a rebellion 
against "the anti-worker, multinational" corporation philosophy of the 1980s, 
which Trumka said has turned working life into a joyless and insecure 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an audience of 800 at the 43rd annual Labor Day breakfast of the 
Catholic Labor Institute of Southern California, Trumka said the country's 
standard of living has plummeted since the Reagan Administration and its allies 
in the business community "tried to instill their vision of America." 
</P>
<P>
He described that vision as an all-consuming demand for profits at the expense 
of workers, with consequences ranging from a longer workweek to shrinking 
health benefits to the exporting of hundreds of thousands of jobs to Third 
World countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Prison of Work' 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are being trapped in a prison of work that has no allowance for 
families, for hobbies, for community service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trumka, whose union's 5-month-old stalemated strike against Pittston Coal Co. 
in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky is widely considered a metaphor for the 
weakening hand of organized labor, said federal labor laws drafted in the 1930s 
to ensure a system of collective bargaining are breaking down under new tactics 
by management. 
</P>
<P>
"The labor laws have become a cruel hoax," he said. "They are a no-win 
situation for us." 
</P>
<P>
Trumka, who was honored as "citizen of the year" at the breakfast, echoed a 
frequent complaint of American labor leaders, who say management now often 
refuses to bargain seriously with unions in order to force a strike and then 
replace strikers with non-union personnel. 
</P>
<P>
These critics say rulings by the National Labor Relations Board under the 
Reagan Administration eroded protection of workers during union organizing, 
bargaining and strikes. Labor lawyers say companies now use the board to delay 
union elections or bargaining over contracts. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,900 Pittston miners have been on strike since April after working 14 
months without a contract. Even though the UMW has engendered substantial 
public sympathy -- about 3,400 of its members have been arrested, most in civil 
disobedience actions, and a regional NLRB office found that Pittston engaged in 
unfair labor practices in West Virginia -- Pittston has shown no signs of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The coal company wants to reduce labor costs by subcontracting more work, 
dropping limits on overtime and leaving a multi-employer pension fund. While 
the UMW was working without a contract, Pittston cut off retiree health 
benefits for a year. The company also refuses mine worker demands to guarantee 
that laid-off union members will get first crack at new jobs and to guarantee 
that mines would stay unionized if they were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Trumka, a miner-turned-lawyer, said Pittston "wanted the right, in essence, to 
do away with the mine workers," whose national membership has fallen to 70,000 
from 250,000 in the early 1970s. Pittston, with assistance from hundreds of 
Virginia state police and unsympathetic judges, "wanted to break our will. They 
wanted to break our spirit. They wanted to say it's OK for a rich company to 
break its social contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We said . . . you will not beat us in this strike!" Trumka said to thunderous 
applause. "You will not deny hope to our children." 
</P>
<P>
While the breakfast attracted the traditional Democratic Party allies of labor, 
including Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 
and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, it was without the equally traditional presence 
of Los Angeles' Roman Catholic archbishop. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, whose relationship with labor has been strained 
because of his active resistance to a campaign to organize the archdiocese's 
cemetery workers, notified the Catholic Labor Institute in June that he would 
not attend the breakfast. Mahony celebrated a Labor Day Mass on Sunday at St. 
Vibiana's Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony subsequently said in an interview that the main reason for not attending 
the Labor Day breakfast was to ensure a higher attendance at the Mass by making 
it a separate function. He also said he had been offended by the political 
partisanship of the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The schism began in February when the archdiocese's 140 cemetery workers voted 
by a narrow margin to be represented by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile 
Workers Union. The archdiocese objected to the union's organizing tactics. A 
three-member arbitration panel has held hearings on whether the vote should be 
upheld, and a final decision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the homily for Sunday's Mass, Mahony -- long an ally of organized labor -- 
said, "Many misunderstandings have occurred, and much energy has been spent 
which has tended to divide the traditional alliance between the Catholic Church 
and the labor movement. This is regretable, and no one has benefitted from this 
time of tension."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BIDS SOUGHT FOR AIRPORT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Public Works has launched a search for a firm to build 
a computerized traffic control system to reduce congestion around Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The board gave notice that it will take bids until Oct. 4 for an Automated 
Traffic Surveillance and Control system, similar to the ones already in place 
downtown and around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
City engineers estimate the project will cost $2.77 million. 
</P>
<P>
ATSAC systems take information on how traffic is flowing, and synchronize 
signals accordingly. They also allow engineers operating the systems from a 
downtown "nerve center" to adjust for unusual problems, minimizing the 
resulting congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"At the Coliseum, there was a 10 to 12% decrease in the number of stops cars 
make, and a 10% increase in average speed," said Wilbur Takashimi, city traffic 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
That ATSAC system, the first in the city, was built in time for the 1984 
Olympics. It performed beyond expectations, prompting plans for a series of 
ATSACs around the city that will eventually form a single network. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown system was completed this year, and another is under construction 
in the Westwood and Century City areas. 
</P>
<P>
The airport ATSAC system will involve 98 intersections, compared to 212 in the 
downtown network.

FOR GARCIA, GOING FROM PLANNER TO LOBBYIST WAS EASY

<P>
Daniel P. Garcia, former president of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission, 
was explaining why he became a land development lawyer-lobbyist -- one of the 
most successful at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had my heart attack or whatever it was, I was in the hospital," he 
said. "It occurred to me that leading the two lives of doing litigation on the 
one hand and running the Planning Commission was too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It had taken too big a personal toll. I had already gone through two divorces 
and I was in the hospital, overweight, smoking, eating too much. This was not 
what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, a partner in the downtown Los Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; 
Olson, is representing the Porter Ranch Development Co. in its effort to win 
city permission to build a huge residential and commercial subdivision on 1,300 
acres in the far northwest San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of several former top city officials who have gone through what 
critics consider a "revolving door," moving from public life into lobbying or 
consulting for clients with business before the city. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development Co. is also represented by former City Councilman 
Robert Wilkinson, who once represented the district where the big subdivisions 
would be built. 
</P>
<P>
And in another City Hall link, Porter Ranch has also hired as a consultant Paul 
Clarke, who has been a top political adviser to the current councilman, Hal 
Bernson, and also is a close personal friend. That is part of another City Hall 
pattern: Developers and others with business before the council often hire 
lobbyists or consultants with close ties to certain council members. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Garcia as a land development attorney had a major impact 
because, as Planning Commission president, he was one of the most influential 
men in city government. 
</P>
<P>
The planning commissioners are part-timers, paid a nominal amount for their 
work. But Garcia, with a love for detail, politics and power, extended his 
influence beyond the commission. 
</P>
<P>
He worked with staff members in the writing of zoning laws and community plans. 
He was a close adviser to Mayor Tom Bradley, who had appointed him, and he 
influenced mayoral policy. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia did his work with a point of view -- moderately pro-development, walking 
a line between slow-growthers, of whom he disapproved, and those committed to 
unbridled development. 
</P>
<P>
His opposition to the slow-growth movement stemmed, in part, from his Latino 
background. A ban on building, he said, would cost jobs, limit housing 
opportunity and cause social tension between the working class and the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Porter Ranch Development Co., Garcia has other big business 
clients, including May Centers; Ratovich Co., a major developer and restorer of 
historic buildings; Price Co., the big discount firm; and Harvey Capitol Co. 
</P>
<P>
His clients have been major players in city politics over the years. Since 
1982, eight of his clients have donated $226,163 to city political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Did his years in City Hall give him special influence with the mayor, the 
council and members of the Planning Department staff? 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people have access to the mayor," he said. "I would say I have good 
access, but I don't think it is distinguishable (from that of others). The fact 
that I was in city government -- does that account for that access, in part? 
Yes, of course." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody approves any projects simply because of me, and Porter Ranch is a good 
example. I haven't lobbied anyone on Porter Ranch. I'm not the lobbyist on 
Porter Ranch. They've got Wilkinson and I assume (developer Nathan) Shapell is 
talking to people." 
</P>
<P>
Although Garcia said he does not lobby council members, he has written strong 
legal and planning arguments defending the Porter Ranch project's effect on 
schools and on regional planning aspects of the development.

THE TAX MAN APOLOGIZES; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC RETRACTION IS DUE THOSE WRONGLY NAMED AS DELINQUENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Ray Fowler scanned his morning newspaper to see whether any of his friends or 
neighbors had made the list of Los Angeles County taxpayers who were late 
paying their property taxes. The last thing he expected to find was his own 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just not a happy experience to go whipping down the delinquency column 
and find yourself listed there," he said -- especially since he had paid his 
taxes. He said the list, prepared by the county tax collector, left his friends 
and neighbors with the erroneous impression that "Ray Fowler is a deadbeat" and 
brought him "strange looks" at his bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like having a pie thrown in your face," said Lillian Romero-Gomez, who 
was shocked to find her name on the list, even after she had sent copies of her 
paid tax bill to the tax collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
They and a few other taxpayers complained to their county supervisor. The 
result was a change in county policy. From now on, taxpayers erroneously 
identified as delinquent can get a public apology from the tax collector in the 
form of a published retraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mindful of Image 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County tax collector's office, mindful of its image, recently 
led a successful lobbying effort in Sacramento that led to a change in state 
law allowing counties to delay publication of the lists for up to a year in 
order to ensure their accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
The county is required by state law to publish the lists of delinquent 
taxpayers. But it does not make the same effort to notify those who are due 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 taxpayers a year are believed to overpay their taxes but never 
receive refunds because the county cannot find them. Unclaimed money is 
deposited into the county treasury after a four-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the coffers were boosted by $479,626 in overpaid property taxes, 
including $7,387 due a single unwitting taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said it would be unfair for the general taxpayer to bear the 
expense of tracking down taxpayers who, in the words of one official, are "poor 
record keepers." They said it is the taxpayers' responsibility to keep track of 
how much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Each September 
</P>
<P>
As for the county's delinquency lists, nobody knows how many taxpayers' names 
end up there mistakenly. The lists are published every September in community 
newspapers, and nearly 100,000 names appeared last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax officials say mistakes are inevitable because of the sheer volume of 
property tax bills -- a staggering 2.5 million -- and the complexity of the tax 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sanchez, manager of the tax collector's secured property division, said 
she "would be surprised if I have 50 people" a year complain that their names 
were published in error. Until now, the tax collector has sent letters of 
apology to taxpayers "and to whomever they tell us they want us to write," 
including gossipy neighbors, Assistant Tax Collector David Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
That was not enough for Supervisor Pete Schabarum. He recently won his 
colleagues' approval to require the tax collector to publish an apology when 
requested by a taxpayer. Tax Collector Sandra Davis said her office will 
determine whether an error has been made. Wording of the apology has not been 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum proposed the new policy after complaints from several constituents, 
including Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, owner of apartment buildings in Claremont, said he saw his name on the 
list published in his community paper, the Claremont Courier. 
</P>
<P>
He said he paid his taxes in December, 1987, but because of a processing error, 
received a delinquency notice in the mail the following June, the month the tax 
collector sends notices to delinquent taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting that he had paid, he sent another check. Perusing his financial 
records the next day, he found proof of his earlier payment and stopped payment 
on the second check. 
</P>
<P>
"How many other citizens have paid twice under such circumstances?" he wrote 
Schabarum. "If the county records show I'm delinquent, and I don't have an 
infallible system and am busy, as well as basically compliant, I'm inclined to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
Tax Collector Davis, in a letter of response to Schabarum, said Fowler was at 
least partly responsible for the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fowler did not review his records before taking action and sent a check to 
cover the delinquencies. Had he determined that payment was made and so advised 
this office, research would have uncovered the processing error and it could 
have been corrected so that no default or published notice would have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But Fowler and two other taxpayers interviewed said they tried for months to 
clear up the matter with the tax collector before contacting Schabarum, whose 
office resolved the problems within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tax collector's office, Fowler said, "Most of them treated me 
as if they were not in the tax collector's office, but in the felony division 
of the Sheriff's Department, and I was the culprit." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of its image, the tax collector's office recently began training its 
operators in "telephone etiquette." In addition, the Board of Supervisors has 
allocated $4 million to add phone lines and increase staff in the tax 
collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers do not want taxes raised, but they want immediate service," said 
Sanchez, pointing out that the tax collector's office processes more than 4 
million tax payments a year and is still not fully computerized. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Greenbaum-Maya, another Claremont taxpayer who wrote Schabarum, said she 
was "outraged" to find her name on the delinquency list. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not how I wanted to appear in the paper, as delinquent in my taxes," 
she said. "I am a psychologist, and I work in the area where I live, and that's 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
And, "as far as we knew," it was unfounded, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya admitted that she was not entirely blameless. She and her 
husband indeed owed taxes, but she said they were unaware of it until they saw 
their name in the newspaper. She said she never received a notice in the mail 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya said that after she saw her name in the paper, "we did the 
conscientious thing" and immediately called and wrote the tax collector's 
office to try to clear up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her efforts, she said her and her husband's name appeared in the 
newspaper a second time. The lists are published three consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers have mixed views about a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
"The county uses its money poorly enough as it is," Fowler said. "The issue is 
really at the front end. Why did this whole thing happen in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya and Romero-Gomez said they welcome retractions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the fair thing to do," Greenbaum-Maya said.

PHYSICIANS' BIAS THWARTS AIDS PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SCHRAM, Neil Schram, an internist in Harbor City, is chairman of the 
AIDS Task Force for the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of recent major advances in AIDS prevention, physicians' involvement in 
the epidemic is more critical than ever, yet it is not occurring. A major 
barrier is prejudice. Reducing prejudice, or at least changing physician 
behavior, is a challenge that the profession's leadership must take. 
</P>
<P>
The physician's role in AIDS prevention today involves taking a sexual and 
drug-use history from all patients and encouraging people with past or present 
high-risk behavior to take the HIV antibody test. Those who test positive need 
evaluation of their immune systems, and if impaired, will need AZT and possibly 
other medications to prevent or delay disease. However, the initial step -- 
taking the patient's sexual and drug-use history -- is not being done. The 
reason appears to be physician prejudice against homosexual/bisexual men and an 
aversion to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Physician bias against a wide range of patients has been known to the 
profession's leadership for years and even documented, yet no major effort has 
been made to change those attitudes. In a survey of physicians in Michigan and 
Australia published in 1982, negative stereotypes were found about alcohol 
abusers, unhygienic patients, angry patients, drug abusers, obese patients and 
patients with minor mental disorders. The authors advised intervention during 
medical school if the behaviors that flow from negative stereotypes are to be 
changed. They did not address changing the behavior of physicians in private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
A third-year medical student, Hannah Brooks, wrote in a medical honors society 
journal in 1987, "Physicians also become angry with patients whose problems 
they perceive (with or without justification) as being self-inflicted." This 
is, of course, a major problem with AIDS, as well as other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Also published in 1987 was a study of medical students' attitudes toward AIDS 
and homosexual patients. It showed that "medical students view AIDS patients in 
a highly negative manner, as they do homosexual patients regardless of their 
illness." 
</P>
<P>
The authors said that developing ways to counter such attitudes "is a topic 
that merits the attention of medical educators." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Assn. of American Medical Colleges recommended that faculty 
members help medical students and residents understand and accept personal risk 
in the practice of medicine, overcome their biases and prejudices and learn to 
cope with the emotional demands of certain types of patient care. (They did not 
indicate who would help change the attitudes of faculty members.) 
</P>
<P>
Because physicians are people first, they have the same prejudices as any other 
group; ours is a racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic society. We may not be able 
to dramatically change that. But when biases threaten peoples' lives -- and 
they do when physicians shun AIDS prevention -- then medical leaders must 
address the issue. This has not yet happened. 
</P>
<P>
Prejudice can cause harm, directly or indirectly; it influences what a 
physician does or, just as important, does not do. Numerous medical 
organizations have advised physicians that they have an obligation to AIDS 
prevention that starts with including sexual behavior and drug use in taking a 
patient's history. Yet in a poll reported at the fifth International AIDS 
Conference this summer, less than 4% of the respondents had discussed sexual 
behavior related to AIDS with their physicians; most said they wanted such a 
discussion but were waiting for the physician to initiate it. 
</P>
<P>
So how can this change? There are no easy answers. But first the medical 
profession's leaders must acknowledge that there is a problem. While they have 
little leverage over individual physicians, they can take realistic steps 
toward improving the medical community's awareness and engaging its 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
For an example of what this can achieve, the experience of San Francisco in the 
early 1980s is persuasive: Through a concerted educational program on the 
hazards of AIDS, virtually all of the gay male community changed its concept of 
acceptable sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Countless people would benefit if physicians would change the attitude they 
have toward many diseases, so that, in the case of AIDS, for example, taking a 
drug use and sexual history is as common as a blood-pressure check. 
</P>
<P>
The Hippocratic Oath requires that physicians "exercise (their) art . . . for 
the prevention of disease." People -- all people, not just those at risk for 
AIDS -- have the right to expect that this oath is being observed for the sake 
of public health -- the health of all.

CRITICS PERCEIVE CHANGE OF HEART IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Costa Mesa has been described as the Orange County city with a 
heart, a place where elected officials once proposed -- in all seriousness -- 
that the United States buy Baja California in a humanitarian gesture to promote 
commerce and ethnic harmony. 
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence this year of a new City Council majority, that 
reputation for tolerance and compassion is being challenged by a series of 
actions aimed at the city's immigrant and low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Mayor Peter F. Buffa has joined Councilmen Orville Amburgey 
and Ed Glasgow in restricting the way day workers can solicit employment, 
ousting a social service center that caters to the needy, and ordering 
organizations that accept city funds not to assist illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The last policy has prompted a review by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to determine if it violates federal anti-discrimination law. 
It has also created confusion within organizations that operate health clinics, 
which are supposed to be exempt from the alien ban. When the council meets 
tonight, it is scheduled to discuss implemention. 
</P>
<P>
While social service officials have been outraged by the council actions, many 
residents of the upscale and overwhelmingly Anglo city have circulated 
petitions calling for local government to do even more in dealing with illegal 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (anti-immigrant) feelings have been there all along," said Jean 
Forbath, executive director of Share Our Selves and incoming chairwoman of the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission. "But the people who possess those 
feelings now have a voice and an organ through which they can express them." 
</P>
<P>
That organ, Forbath said recently, is the current City Council: Buffa, 
Amburgey, Glasgow and Councilwomen Sandra L. Genis and Mary Hornbuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Only Hornbuckle, on the council since 1984, voted against all three measures 
involving immigrant and low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the last couple of years our stance on the council had been that we 
would deal with this issue in a positive way . . . that we would try to be that 
kinder, gentler city, and we had been pretty unified behind that," Hornbuckle 
said. "Now all of a sudden we have a council that encourages division. Who is 
next to be attacked by the council? The homeless? Asians? Where will we end in 
creating an 'us-against-them' situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the tone of the council began to change when Buffa and Amburgey 
were elected in 1986. Each received thousands of dollars in campaign 
contributions from local developers, including C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, 
which had been frustrated in its inability to get its proposed, 20-story Home 
Ranch office development approved by the city. Glasgow joined the council in 
1988, also receiving contributions from Segerstrom while praising Home Ranch as 
a model project. (In that same election, however, voters rejected a pair of 
ballot measures that called for construction of Home Ranch, and the project has 
been stalled since.) 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last March and April, Segerstrom contributed $1,000 each to the 
political committees of Amburgey and Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom spokesman Malcolm Ross declined to comment about the recent actions 
involving immigrants or his company's past support of the three councilmen. 
</P>
<P>
Genis, also elected last fall, said she joined the majority in voting to cancel 
the lease of Forbath's Share Our Selves because she felt that the agency had 
grown too big for its westside neighborhood, around the Rea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
But the other immigrant measures went too far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a problem that is going to go away, but the issue is how 
you deal with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey, Buffa and Glasgow defend their votes, asserting that the measures are 
necessary to stem a growing tide of undocumented workers who contribute to 
crime and other problems in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting so many illegal aliens in town that they are creating 
problems," Glasgow contended. "It's against the law for them to be in the 
United States and our actions let everyone know that we are going to comply 
with the (immigration) law." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow, a retired police captain and former city planning commissioner, is 
seen as a close ally of Amburgey. Both come from law enforcement backgrounds, 
and Amburgey made significant contributions and loans to Glasgow's political 
campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Amburgey's election that critics see as a turning point for the 
council. A former Costa Mesa police lieutenant and self-described law-and-order 
proponent, he made illegal aliens a campaign theme when he ran in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey acknowledges that recent measures, particularly the illegal-alien 
funding ban, have exposed him to heavy criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a hot issue, and if this is the one that costs me reelection, then 
so be it," he said. "I was elected to do what I think is best." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey is also quick to defend himself against charges -- often brought up at 
City Council meetings -- that his zeal to rid the city of illegal aliens 
borders on racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to have been married to a Hispanic for 36 years so that carries no 
water at all," he said. "I am really not the bad ogre that people would like to 
think. I'll compare my record (on service to the community) with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey said he is not convinced by those who argue that the problem of 
illegal immigration is tied to the unavailability of work in native lands. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been down to Mexicali on tours to see the situation and would say there 
is an awful lot of employment in Mexico if they want to work there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But while Amburgey is seen as the force behind recent city actions, it is 
Buffa's role that has confounded critics the most. 
</P>
<P>
An independent television producer and former planning commissioner, Buffa's 
1986 campaign was geared to improving city services and addressing the needs of 
the growing Latino and Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
He said his support of the dayworker and alien funding policies was reluctant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely difficult for me personally as a first-generation American 
(his family is Italian) to take any kind of action against someone trying to 
make it in another country," Buffa said. "But when the numbers increase to the 
extent they are a tangible impact on citizens, I wish I had the luxury to 
ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
For Amburgey, Glasgow and Buffa, the issue is a simple one: Illegal aliens are 
violating federal law and the city is duty-bound to uphold all laws, whether 
federal, state or local. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the city has changed so much as the problem has intensified," 
Amburgey said. "It had gotten to the magnitude that we had to do something. It 
would be politically expedient to turn our heads and say we, as local 
officials, can't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey charges that illegal aliens have increased crime rates and have 
contributed to overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
He said Costa Mesa's reputation for charity and moderation has worked against 
the city, making it a magnet for undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we tell them we will feed and cloth and house them, we unintentionally 
encourage them to sneak across the border," Amburgey contended. "If we don't 
provide services and don't encourage them, maybe they will go back home." 
</P>
<P>
But others dispute the councilman's claims that Costa Mesa's illegal alien 
population has increased. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a very big problem before, and the situation doesn't seem to have 
changed very much," argued former councilman Dave Wheeler. An attorney and 
slow-growth advocate known for his freewheeling style, Wheeler was elected to 
the council in 1984 but did not to seek a second term. "Police statistics then 
showed there wasn't a crime problem in the areas where (immigrants) 
congregated. But the response of the city has changed from one of monitoring 
for crime to one of usurping federal authority. They have gone beyond their 
role (as local officials)." 
</P>
<P>
A recent report assessing the impact of immigration reform law in the county 
estimates that 150,000 people without legal status reside and work in the 
county. But the study offers no city-by-city breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa residents have complained about loitering, drunkenness, harassment 
and litter in the areas where most dayworkers congregate, near the 
intersections of 18th Street and Newport Boulevard, which encompasses nearby 
Lions Park, and 20th Street and Santa Ana Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
However, police statistics do not support claims of increased crime. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't really any major increase in the more harmful crimes," said Costa 
Mesa Police Sgt. Tim Holbrooke, who is in charge of the westside substation. 
"Certainly some crime is related to the Hispanic population but to what degree 
it involves undocumented workers we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Lions Park, where the biggest congregations have been, has shown a 
decrease in the numbers of dayworkers. We're not sure why." 
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said many residents who complain about large numbers of Latino men 
coming and going in their neighborhood mistakenly assume that they are 
undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a talk with a community group the other day and explained that a lot of 
the people they see are here legally and work; so when they see a lot of foot 
traffic, they are going to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Bernard King, a member of the city's human relations committee, said the 
council's actions reflect a lingering prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that this is a dying gasp of those who view Costa Mesa and Orange 
County in general as a last bastion of the white race," he said. "But the 
demographics have changed. We will either have to learn to live together as 
diverse cultures or become totally out of touch with reality." 
</P>
<P>
King asserted that the council's actions have given the city a black eye, and 
he noted that little more than a year ago the city was being lauded for its 
innovative programs to ease ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Initial complaints about day workers were addressed through formation of a city 
task force that promoted greater cultural awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city designated a week in April as Human Relations Week and 
officials also inaugurated a program called Living Room Dialogues where 
residents were invited to neighborhood meetings to discuss the experiences of 
immigrants from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
According to King, no community leaders have voiced support of the council's 
recent actions. 
</P>
<P>
However, John Brechtal, assistant district director at the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, defended the measures. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is on the leading edge . . . in looking for new solutions because the 
old ones haven't worked," Brechtal said. 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that because of political and economic forces at work in 
Central and South America, neither current levels of federal intervention nor 
actions of one city are likely to stop the flow of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, critics worry that as other cities explore Costa Mesa's actions for 
precedent, those larger issues will be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone agrees there has to be a solution to the immigration problem, 
but it is a more global problem and will take a more global solution than what 
is going on in Costa Mesa," Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How The Costa Mesa Council Voted 
</P>
<P>
On issues touching immigrants and the poor, the Costa Mesa City Council 
majority has included Mayor Pete Buffa and Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed 
Glasgow. Councilwomen Mary Hornbuckle and Sandra L. Genis mostly disagree with 
their proposals. 
</P>

TODAY'S DRUG SPEECH KEY PART OF BUSH AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Practically from the beginning, the White House has viewed today's presidential 
speech on drugs as one of the highlights of George Bush's first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as April, top Administration officials devised a three-pronged 
political strategy for the rest of the year: a series of speeches on foreign 
policy; then, a Clean Air Act proposal, and, finally, a nationally televised 
speech -- the first such prime-time address of his presidency -- on how to 
combat "the scourge" of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The speech is scheduled for 6 p.m. PDT and will be broadcast live by the major 
television networks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bickering Likely 
</P>
<P>
Given the nation's intense interest in the drug problem, the speech is likely 
to set off partisan bickering over whether Bush is presenting truly new ideas 
or is packaging proposals that have already been offered by Democrats or are 
already being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
And, more than that, the big question is likely to be over how to pay the bill 
for the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, the President risks letting the drug issue turn into a 
major liability. After all, in his inaugural address, he pledged that "this 
scourge will stop," and it is far from certain that he, or any President, has 
the power to fulfill that promise. Presidents have been waging war on drugs for 
decades, and, so far, drugs have won. 
</P>
<P>
And, after years of drug fighting, the field is largely barren of new ideas. 
Bush's plan, the details of which have been widely leaked by Administration 
officials, consists mostly of renewed efforts to do things that already are 
being done, shifting some emphasis, providing some additional money and hoping 
that better coordination among existing federal programs will improve the 
effort overall. 
</P>
<P>
The main hope is that a changing public attitude -- rising intolerance toward 
casual drug use -- coupled with the general aging of the population, will 
reduce demand for drugs sufficiently to put a noticeable dent in drug 
trafficking. If that does not happen, Bush could see his bold promise backfire. 
</P>
<P>
But White House aides are content to let the long term take care of itself. For 
now, they feel, the public wants to know that the President is taking this 
issue seriously. For that purpose, Colombia's recent crackdown on its drug 
cartels, which has focused public attention even more on the drug issue, has 
placed Bush in a politically advantageous position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Left in Dilemma 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Bush's Democratic opponents in a dilemma. Democratic strategists 
fear that, if they merely acquiesce in Bush's proposals, they could allow the 
White House once again to seize the initiative on a major policy issue. But, if 
they criticize Bush too much, they risk White House charges of "politicizing" 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"A President can always, always control whatever issue there is if the 
President takes it seriously," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph 
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who will deliver the Democratic response to Bush's 
speech tonight. Biden's committee plans to begin hearings on Bush's plan 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democratic leaders are angry that Bush seems likely to be able to claim 
credit for initiatives that the Democrats feel they began last year when 
Congress forced President Ronald Reagan to accept legislation establishing a 
federal "drug czar" and ordered that the White House draft a comprehensive 
anti-drug strategy by today. Now, Bush has taken that legislation and used it 
as a springboard for a major initiative of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties are eager for success in fighting the drug problem, particularly 
in view of its social cost, largely in urban areas. But both parties want to be 
recognized for what they accomplish, and neither can afford to be seen as 
negative or obstructionist, strategists say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want Bush to Succeed 
</P>
<P>
Democrats do not want Bush to be able to take full credit, but they want his 
efforts to succeed. Otherwise, noted one key Democratic senator who asked not 
to be named, angry voters might well turn against officeholders of both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like inflation," the Senate Democrat said. "They'll take it out on 
whoever's there." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Colombia has only aggravated the predicament of Bush's 
opponents. The Democrats' function of responding to the President "has been 
made much more difficult by what's happening in Colombia, because it gives Bush 
the ability to make grand gestures," a strategist for the Democratic 
congressional leadership said. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Democrats and Republicans in Congress had maintained an uneasy 
peace on questions of drug policy, with both sides agreeing to withhold hostile 
comments until drug czar William J. Bennett completed the proposals that Bush 
will announce tonight. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been growing apprehension on each side that the other might try 
to seize the issue for political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politicization Angers Democrats 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bennett included Republican National Committee Chairman Lee 
Atwater among those with whom he consulted about the details of the plan. That 
angered Democrats, who thought such overt politicization of the issue violated 
the bipartisan truce. 
</P>
<P>
By late July, a number of furious Senate Democrats were urging Biden, the 
party's leading expert on the drug problem, to release his own proposed 
anti-drug strategy in advance of the Administration plan. "They were mad as 
hell that they were being used," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
When Bennett got word of the Democratic pressure, he, too, betrayed concern. In 
private meetings and telephone conversations with Biden, he asked frequently: 
"You aren't going to release your plan, are you?" according to sources familiar 
with the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Only with the help of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) was 
Biden able to hold off demands of his colleagues and fulfill his pledge to 
Bennett that the Administration could have first crack at the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Biden's own plan differs from Bennett's in large part in the relative amounts 
to spend on measures to combat drug demand versus measures to combat supply. 
Drug treatment centers are a major concern for largely Democratic 
constituencies in large cities. They are of lower priority for the GOP's more 
suburban voters. 
</P>
<P>
Biden argues that "there ought to be roughly a 50-50 split" between measures 
aimed at reducing the demand for drugs and those aimed at restricting their 
supply. By contrast, the Administration plan is weighted 70% toward reducing 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
But the real argument over Bush's plan is likely to be the same one that is 
generated by virtually all initiatives in these days of tight federal budgets: 
Where's the money? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Funds for New Programs 
</P>
<P>
The budget argument hits the central weakness of Bush's approach: His 
determination to keep federal spending down leaves him very little room to 
develop programs to meet new national needs. The Democrats, by arguing that 
Bush has good ideas but is not backing them up with funds, hope that they will 
be able to criticize the President without appearing uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism has already begun, even in advance of Bush's speech. On a recent 
"Face the Nation" show, for example, Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) told 
Bennett that "this strategy is meaningless without real dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Rangel complained that the President was setting goals and then leaving it to 
Congress to find the funds. "The President must show leadership," Rangel said, 
"or it's a cruel hoax." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Democrats, however, this kind of criticism has failed in 
the past, in part because Democrats have done no better than Bush in finding 
ways to pay for the programs they support. They have scored few political 
points, for example, by noting that Bush has proposed no way to finance his 
ambitious call for a space mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials argue that, in fact, they are indeed dedicating new 
money to the drug fight. Simultaneously, however, they suggest that money 
should not, after all, be the major test of whether Bush's plan is sincere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coordination Is Key to Bush Plan 
</P>
<P>
"If folks are going to focus on the price tag, they are missing the boat," 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu told reporters here recently. The key 
to Bush's program, he said, would be "coordination of the agencies" to "make 
sure the funds are well spent." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides can point to history to bolster their suggestion that, if money 
alone could end the drug trade, the fight would have been won long ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, for example, President Richard M. Nixon, alarmed about the spread of 
heroin addiction out of the nation's ghettos and into the suburbs, announced a 
major anti-drug drive that included an extra $1 million to Mexico for border 
interdiction and $12.4 million for a new campaign of drug education. 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, federal anti-drug efforts had reached $800 million. And, in 1986, when 
President and Nancy Reagan jointly announced their "Just Say No" anti-drug 
campaign, the President called for increasing the anti-drug budget to $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amount of New Spending Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Bush's new package will cost about $7.8 billion, Administration officials say. 
How much of that will actually be increased spending remains a matter of 
considerable debate. Administration officials said the total would be about $2 
billion more than is currently being spent. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say Administration officials are playing games with numbers. Only 
the additional aid to drug-producing countries in South America, $260 million, 
represents a real budgetary increase, they say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the single biggest items in the Administration's plan is a 
call for a massive increase in prison construction. That is something Bush 
proposed months ago, in May, when he announced his anti-crime package. Now, 
critics say, he is trying to count the money twice.

VOTE PROTEST HEATS UP IN SOUTH AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
TUTU DETAINED, STUDENTS FIRED ON AS ELECTIONS NEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Riot police fired shotguns and tear gas at demonstrating college students in 
Durban, arrested and briefly detained Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and other 
leading anti-apartheid clergymen in Cape Town and halted a march on 
Johannesburg's City Hall on Monday. The increasingly heated clashes with 
defiant blacks came only two days before nationwide elections that exclude the 
black majority. 
</P>
<P>
While his government was cracking down on dissenters, acting President Frederik 
W. de Klerk told a political meeting in Johannesburg that "discrimination must 
be eliminated" and pledged his ruling National Party to "a new South Africa 
which will be just and strong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Challenge 
</P>
<P>
It was De Klerk's final campaign speech before Wednesday's parliamentary 
elections, which are considered one of his party's most difficult challenges in 
nearly half a century of rule. 
</P>
<P>
The election has been all but overshadowed, however, by a nationwide campaign 
of civil disobedience, which has gathered momentum and world attention since it 
began Aug. 2. Police have arrested 1,600 activists, detained 240 others without 
charge, banned 14 meetings and broken up at least 46 political gatherings in 
the past month, according to the independent Human Rights Commission, which 
issued a report on the defiance campaign Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the defiance action, major anti-apartheid groups and the country's 
two largest black labor federations have called for a two-day general strike 
beginning today, and hundreds of thousands of black workers and students are 
expected to join the work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follows Rally Ban 
</P>
<P>
The arrest Monday of Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate, followed the banning 
of a "free and fair elections" rally at the City Hall in downtown Cape Town, 
where police and demonstrators have clashed several times in recent days. 
Police have sweeping powers to ban political gatherings under the country's 
three-year-old state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was rescheduled for a nearby Methodist church, and at least 100 
officers in riot gear blocked the church doors with armored trucks and turned 
activists away. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, the Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid campaigner, and the Rev. 
Allan Boesak, mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, 
were among 11 leaders who arrived at the church and "made it clear they 
objected to a police vehicle blocking a church in a Christian country," 
according to Tutu's press aide, John Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that people were trapped inside the church, the clergymen refused to 
leave and were arrested. They were taken to the police station, held in jail 
cells and released 90 minutes later. It was the second arrest in less than a 
week for Tutu and Boesak, who have been prominent in the defiance campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"They have gone berserk," Tutu said after being released. "They are clearly no 
longer in charge, and they are aware of it. I want to say to the world that the 
terrorists in South Africa are the South African government." 
</P>
<P>
In Durban, several thousand students at the multiracial University of Natal 
defied a police ban on an anti-election rally. Police arrested 13 people after 
firing on the crowd with tear gas and bullets, unidentified witnesses told news 
agencies. About 10 people were injured in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby University of Durban-Westville, police broke up a group of 500 
demonstrators using batons and tear gas and arrested 11. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before De Klerk's speech to National Party supporters at City Hall in 
Johannesburg, about 125 blacks carrying placards attempted to march to the 
building and present a letter to De Klerk, "detailing our views about the 
elections and the system of apartheid in this country," said Cyril Ramaphosa, 
general secretary of the nation's largest union, the National Union of 
Mineworkers. 
</P>
<P>
Ordered by police to disperse, the marchers refused and sat down on the 
pavement. After a 15-minute standoff, a police officer accepted the group's 
letter and the crowd left. 
</P>
<P>
The government believes the defiance campaign is aimed at triggering violence 
and disrupting the elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to come down mercilessly and hard on anyone who wishes to 
disrupt the elections," Brig. Leon Mellet, a police spokesman, said. Polling 
stations already are under guard, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
University Closes 
</P>
<P>
The University of Cape Town, a multiracial institution that has been the 
frequent site of anti-apartheid protests, announced Monday that it is closing 
its doors today and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"For the university to adopt an attitude of business as usual in the context of 
the tensions surrounding the elections and the denial of fundamental freedoms . 
. . would be neither principled nor possible," Vice Chancellor Stuart Saunders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the government's attempt to crush the defiance campaign was 
outlined Monday in a special report by the Johannesburg-based Human Rights 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"As the election nears, the government has responded with the full thrust of 
its brutality and repressive machinery" to win votes, the commission said in 
its report, "Days of Defiance." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, defiance campaigners have attempted to highlight apartheid 
laws and severe restrictions on political expression by staging protests at 
whites-only schools, beaches and bus stops and by attempting to hold peaceful 
demonstrations in city centers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the protests, such as a march by 5,000 people on whites-only beaches in 
Durban on Sunday, have been largely peaceful. But others, including an attempt 
by 1,000 people to march in Cape Town on Saturday, have been broken up by 
police with tear gas and water cannons in violent confrontations that have left 
dozens injured.

FOUNDED TO AID KING HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
DREW SCHOOL STRUGGLES TO FIND A STEADY COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Across the street from Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital is a new medical 
school that was founded in hopes of providing King with the brainpower, 
research opportunities and high academic standards critical to any public 
teaching hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a promising beginning, the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine 
and Science in Watts has more recently struggled with fiscal problems and has 
had troubles recruiting top-flight doctors as faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
The medical director at King, Dr. James G. Haughton III, has complained that 
the Drew school -- far from helping the hospital -- has become its "albatross." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he blamed the school for problems in recruiting and retaining 
top doctors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Financial Problems 
</P>
<P>
University President Dr. Walter Leavell denied that the school is an albatross. 
He acknowledged serious financial problems in the past, but said they have been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a wrenching financial crisis and looming $2.5-million deficit at 
Drew forced the layoffs of more than 50 employees. Since then, the faculty has 
been hit by wholesale salary cuts and suspension of payments to the employee 
retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
Independent auditors who examined the university's books from the recent past 
noted that school officials had failed to consistently obtain bids for 
purchases, employees were given monetary advances without supporting documents 
and received loans from school funds without a repayment schedule. Bank 
accounts had not been reconciled for two years, wire transfers were not 
recorded, bounced checks were not followed up, petty cash accounts were 
replenished without proper authorization and vacation hours taken by faculty 
members could not be verified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Light at the End of the Tunnel' 
</P>
<P>
Since then, school officials have struggled hard to put the university on a 
steady course, and as a result, Leavell said, "We can now see the light at the 
end of the tunnel and know that it is not another train." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in the early 1970s, the university was named in honor of a famous black 
doctor and scholar renowned for his research on blood plasma. The school was 
established with the help of doctors and officials from the UCLA and USC 
schools of medicine, which continue to have representatives on Drew's Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The university as a whole is unaccredited, but the medical school, which began 
accepting students in 1980, is accredited through its affiliation with UCLA. 
Drew medical students spend most of their first two years in study at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, Drew attracted a host of top doctors dedicated to the mission of 
creating a medical school that would train minority medical professionals and 
serve the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tumultuous Time 
</P>
<P>
But problems begans surfacing more recently, and the last 18 months have proven 
to be a tumultuous time at Drew, whose $25-million annual budget is derived 
mostly from county, state and federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
* Doctors doing research at Drew have complained that important research has 
ground to a virtual halt. They have complained that they could not get access 
to their grant money to buy even mundane supplies -- including food for 
laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles County sheriff's forgery-fraud unit has launched an 
investigation into the alleged theft by school employees of about $130,000 in 
payroll funds. 
</P>
<P>
* Collection agencies and unpaid vendors have hounded school officials for 
overdue bills. In one example, the school received a final notice from the 
electrical company threatening to shut off service unless an overdue bill for 
$12,521 was paid immediately. 
</P>
<P>
* The school's personnel director reported last fall that "it takes months to 
obtain routine office supplies because we have not paid our vendors." The IRS, 
she reported, had assessed "severe delinquent penalties" against the school for 
late payment of payroll taxes, and the school is "consistently behind (two or 
three months) in processing premium payments for health insurance because of 
cash-flow problems." 
</P>
<P>
* In May, the chairman of the department of neuroscience, Dr. George Locke, 
complained that "monumental problems that exist in Drew's accounts payable and 
procurement sections" were bringing research to a halt at his nationally 
recognized epilepsy center. "Promises have been made to me by every official in 
the school that bills would be paid and that everything would be done to assist 
me in the research program and invariably these promises have not been kept," 
he stated. 
</P>
<P>
Leavell said the school has had problems but added emphatically that laboratory 
animals have never starved and that fiscal controls have been put into place to 
ensure that bills are paid promptly. He said he has made a "sincere effort and 
significant progress" in implementing sound fiscal practices. But even so, he 
said of the school's financial plight: "It hasn't turned around as fast as I 
would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educational, Research Arm 
</P>
<P>
The Drew medical school serves as the educational and research arm of King -- 
in much the same way that USC and UCLA serve the two other county-owned major 
acute-care hospitals. By and large, the medical school faculty serves as the 
senior doctors of the hospital, ultimately responsible for patient care. 
</P>
<P>
The 130 senior doctors at King are dependent upon Drew for important research 
and academic opportunities as well as supplemental stipends to boost their 
hospital salaries. Indeed, the doctors at King are recruited, hired and 
promoted jointly by officials at King and Drew. 
</P>
<P>
As one indication of the overall quality of the school's faculty, 48% of Drew's 
faculty members are certified specialists in their fields of medicine, compared 
to more than 80% at County-USC and Harbor-General. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the turnover among faculty members has left some gaping holes 
at Drew. Three key medical services -- orthopedics, emergency services and 
medicine -- have long lacked full-time permanent chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Established History 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, according to a 1987 management review of King, is that the 
Drew medical school "lacks an established history to which highly qualified 
potential faculty may be attracted." The medical center "has not yet 
established a longstanding reputation for excellence as a teaching 
institution," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marshall Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at UCLA who served on a search 
committee several years ago to recruit candidates for a key vacancy, recalled: 
"No qualified candidate was willing to come forward and take the job. People 
felt it was not a good career opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Drew's financial problems have not made recruiting any easier, even though 
Leavell said that recruiting top faculty and students is his "highest 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
Haughton, King's medical director, complained that Drew officials have set up 
search committees but provided no budget. 
</P>
<P>
He said, for example, that the university set up a search committee a year and 
a half ago to recruit a chairman for the department of emergency medicine -- a 
post that has been vacant for more than seven years. But Haughton said the 
committee "did nothing for a full year" because it had no budget to reimburse 
candidates for their travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Superior Candidates Were Lost' 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Haughton pointed out that during the search for a chairman of 
the department of internal medicine "two superior candidates were lost because 
more than six months after their visit, their travel expenses had not been 
reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
They were both excellent candidates, Haughton said, but they figured, " 'Why 
get involved with a place like this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Leavell countered: "I do not believe that is why we lost the candidates." He 
added that the school has earmarked funds for recruiting but conceded that he 
does not know whether the search committees have actually "accessed the 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have complained that Drew's failure to reimburse its visitors had 
proven embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are constantly being 'dunned' by people who have visited Drew in the last 
six months and have not been reimbursed for out-of-the-pocket expenses. This 
includes candidates for department chair positions, visiting professors and 
faculty being recruited," the doctors declared in a March, 1988, memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash-Flow Problems 
</P>
<P>
Given the school's significant cash-flow problems at the time, Leavell said, 
"That could have happened." 
</P>
<P>
It is the school's administration of research funds that has prompted the 
angriest complaints from some doctors and researchers. They say that after 
complaining for more than a year, the problems are still largely unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Mamdooh Ghoneum, a researcher at Drew with a grant to study cancer immunology, 
said in an interview that "very elementary supplies" he ordered for his 
experiments the first week in December still had not arrived five months later. 
"I've got a $30,000 to $40,000 grant," he said, "But we are doing the very 
minimum level of work, borrowing (supplies) from here and begging from there, 
doing everything I can, even paying for things out of my own pocket." 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1988, Dr. Clarence Grim, an authority on hypertension at Drew, 
convened a meeting of concerned researchers, declaring that "it has become 
clear that the ability to carry out funded grant goals and objectives at Drew 
has virtually stopped because of the school's administrative problems with 
grants management." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Leavell dismissed the complainers as an unrepresentative 
minority of all the researchers. He said they exaggerated a few minor problems, 
which have mostly been resolved. "I'm not aware of anyone's research coming to 
a halt," Leavell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Grim complained in letters to top school officials that researchers could 
not readily purchase supplies because the school took "weeks to months" to 
process purchase orders and suppliers took equally long to ship items. "This 
stems from many suppliers no longer accepting Drew's credit and refusing to 
ship to us," Grim said. 
</P>
<P>
Food for laboratory animals had run out "in the middle of critical 
experiments," Grim asserted, and doctors had been forced to dip into their own 
pockets to buy food to prevent the animals from starving. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a special school committee, responsible under federal law for 
reviewing the use of human subjects in research grant proposals, had virtually 
ceased to function since its secretary was laid off, Grim charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secretary on Loan 
</P>
<P>
Haughton said he loaned the committee a secretary after doctors complained that 
their grant applications were jeopardized by the hamstrung committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't let all the research in the hospital stop because there's nobody to 
take the minutes of a committee meeting," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Leavell said, "Secretarial help was not denied from the school. . . . I even 
offered it out of this office . . . but no one took me up on it. . . . We don't 
have a lot of secretaries, but that's an . . . extremely important function. We 
have a moral and a legal obligation for that function to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration level among some researchers reached the point last year where 
they threatened to demand their grants funds be turned over to some other 
institution for better handling and safeguarding. They also threatened to 
report alleged irregularities to funding authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat Alleged 
</P>
<P>
But Grim said the doctors backed off from filing a formal complaint because "we 
were essentially threatened with being dismissed if we complained about this." 
</P>
<P>
Leavell denied any such threats, but said that some of the statements made by 
the school's dean at the time could have been misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview in March that virtually all complaints involving 
research money had been resolved and that he has set up a process to expedite 
research grant applications and procurement of supplies needed in experiments. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter to school officials in May, Locke, chairman of neuroscience, 
complained of recurrent problems that had seriously undermined his 
multimillion-dollar epilepsy research at Drew. He stated that it was his "moral 
and scientific" responsibility to alert authorities at the National Institute 
of Health, which has funded his research. A formal complaint was filed with NIH 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Documents Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Drew's attorney, Joe Duff, acknowledged that a different funding 
agency -- the U.S. Agency for International Development -- has subpoenaed 
documents from Drew pertaining to research money awarded the school's former 
president, Dr. M. Alfred Haynes. Duff said he has provided federal 
investigators with batches of credit card receipts relating to Haynes' travel 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes left Drew in 1987, at a time when the school's financial problems were 
mounting. 
</P>
<P>
About a year later, Leavell implemented severe cuts to head off financial 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the cuts to faculty members at a meeting Jan. 12, 1988, Leavell 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"You are familiar as I am with the shortcomings that have existed for some 
period of time in our fiscal systems and the credibility of those systems. I 
think your lack of confidence was justified, because those systems were not 
solid, sound and not as responsive as they should have been." 
</P>
<P>
But now, Leavell said he believes that the school is being properly managed. 
"We have rebounded from significant fiscal crisis," he said.

A radical Palestinian group said it executed 15 Arabs on charges of spying for 
the West. A spokesman for the Fatah Revolutionary Council, headed by terrorist 
Abu Nidal, said in West Beirut: "The decision was taken after those 
collaborators refused a call to repent." He said two of the 15 Palestinians 
worked for the CIA, two spied for West Germany and one gathered information for 
Britain. The 14 men and one woman also were linked to the intelligence agencies 
of Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, he charged, and were guilty of 
"meddling with Arab national security and the security of the Palestinian 
revolution."

Two newspapers that identified a source who had been promised anonymity must 
pay him $200,000 in compensatory damages but not the $500,000 in punitive 
damages also awarded by a Hennepin County jury, the Minnesota Court of Appeals 
said. The First Amendment guarantee of press freedom does not protect the Star 
Tribune of Minneapolis or the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch from liability 
under contract laws, in this case their reporters' oral promises of 
confidentiality, the three-judge panel said in upholding the compensatory 
damage award. But the court rejected public relations man Dan Cohen's claim of 
misrepresentation and said he is not entitled to punitive damages.

British police officers said they have recovered the bodies of all 51 victims 
of a collision between a pleasure boat and a barge on the Thames last month. 
Authorities have identified the final victim as Antonio de Vasconcellos, the 
man who chartered the pleasure craft to celebrate his 26th birthday. His 
brother, Domingo, also died when the Bowbelle, a 1,475-ton sand dredger, hit 
the 90-ton Marchioness on Aug. 20 as it cruised down the river in central 
London. Eighty-three people on the Marchioness survived the collision; there 
were no fatalities aboard the sand dredger.

D.C. MAYOR TO ASK AIRING OF DRUG DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Marion Barry of Washington plans to ask for release of his grand jury 
testimony, in which he denied using drugs with a convicted narcotics dealer. 
News reports have said that former city employee Charles Lewis has allegedly 
told prosecutors that he and Barry repeatedly used crack cocaine together. "I'm 
prepared to ask the prosecutor to release my testimony before the grand jury 
and Mr. Lewis' testimony, so therefore the public can see what was said," Barry 
said at a City Hall news conference. "A small group of character assassins have 
taken it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands . . . to do in 
the press what they can't do in court." Testimony before a federal grand jury 
generally is kept under seal until it is brought up in open court. "We have 
nothing to hide regarding the testimony of the mayor or Mr. Lewis," said 
Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy.

PANAMANIANS BLACKLISTED

The United States has placed more than 150 Panamanian officials on a blacklist, 
forbidding U.S. companies and government agencies from buying from them or 
their businesses. U.S. Embassy officials said the action is intended to "hurt 
the pocketbooks" of people associated with Panamanian strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega, who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on 
drug-trafficking charges. The measure affects Panamanian officials who own 
companies that do business with the U.S. Southern Command military 
installations or with the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government agency 
that administers the Panama Canal.

Jerry Lewis coaxed a record $42,209,727 out of viewers of his annual Labor Day 
Telethon, with muscular dystrophy victims appealing for an end to the disease 
that kills children and devastates families. The final pledge figure surpassed 
the 1988 record of $41,132,113. A parade of corporate sponsors donated an 
additional $36,228,846 during the 21 1/2-hour event that ended Monday 
afternoon. The telethons have raised $526,524,210 for the New York City-based 
Muscular Dystrophy Assn. since Lewis, the association's national chairman, 
began the event in 1966. Corporate contributions, which have amounted to 
hundreds of millions of dollars, are not included in the telethon totals. More 
than 50 top-name entertainers were featured on this year's show, which was 
based in Las Vegas.

Mohammed Besharati, quoted by the English-language Tehran Times, said Iran has 
not replied in writing to the messages, sent through the Swiss Embassy in 
Tehran, but has sent an oral response. He said that Washington is trying to 
remove obstacles to better relations between the two countries, which have not 
had diplomatic ties since 1980. "The Bush Administration has realized mistakes

AS REBUILDING LAGS, ARMENIA QUAKE VICTIMS ARE LOSING HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LENINAKAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When heavily laden trucks rumble by in the street outside, the children in 
Karush Pogosyan's family run for shelter. Usually, two dive under the bed, a 
third hides in a wooden wardrobe and the fourth, a cousin, runs about 
frantically, uncertain where she will be safe. 
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake -- they remember the earthquake," Pogosyan said simply, 
recalling the Dec. 7, 1988, temblor that devastated Leninakan and a wide area 
of northern Soviet Armenia. "We all remember the earthquake, in fact, and for 
us the suffering it brought continues, day after day." 
</P>
<P>
Pogosyan and his brothers, Gevork and Hoganes, and their wives and two of the 
older children are living in a tent on one of Leninakan's tree-lined 
boulevards. Most of the children have now been sent to a government vacation 
house to spare them what Karush Pogosyan calls "the misery of being a refugee 
in your own city." 
</P>
<P>
"More than half a year we have been living like this," he said, gesturing 
around an army tent furnished with an assortment of beds, tables and chairs as 
well as the wardrobe salvaged from the wreckage of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are eight of us here, with just a plastic basin for washing, a camping 
set for cooking, a floor that turns into mud with the rain, no lock on the 
door. . . . This is not life -- it's an existence but nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
520,000 Armenians Left Homeless 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake left more than 520,000 Armenians homeless, and the 
reconstruction is proceeding far more slowly than they and the government had 
hoped. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise that all would be rebuilt 
within two years appears over-optimistic, and government engineers talk of 
perhaps five years, even with extensive assistance from other parts of the 
Soviet Union and foreign donors. 
</P>
<P>
The slowness of the redevelopment effort is draining away much of the hope that 
the victims had retained through the first few months after the quake, and a 
social pathology is developing as they remain unhoused and unemployed, their 
families divided and the future uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing another winter without a home, and I don't know how we will make 
it," Gevork Pogosyan said, despair creeping into his voice. "Some people have 
managed to get (construction workers') cabins, and those are all right for a 
small family. We would need a couple, and I don't know where we could get them. 
I just don't know how we will make it through another six months, let alone 
another year or two." 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard where the Pogosyans and perhaps 60 other families are living in a 
collection of army tents, portable cabins, shanties and even a few yurts, the 
circular felt tents of Mongolia, has taken on the look and smell of a refugee 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Block-by-Block Demolition Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Down the street are the shattered ruins of apartment houses where they once 
lived. Demolition is proceeding block by block, adding to the number of people 
on the streets as the ruins in which they were living are leveled. 
</P>
<P>
The querulous temper and soul-destroying malaise, typical of long-term 
refugees, are both growing. The gratitude of surviving an immense tragedy is 
being succeeded by concern over their future, along with a helplessness and 
then by a bitter anger that the authorities are doing too little to assist 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone has been sheltered, fed and clothed, but their lives remain in such 
disarray that few, particularly in Leninakan, appear to have much hope for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Armen L. Goenjian, a Long Beach psychiatrist who has been working with 
mental health specialists here to help people cope psychologically with the 
earthquake and its aftermath, said the housing crisis has become the main 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychiatric care and construction now overlap," he said. "What people need to 
be reassured of, for their well-being and to regain their hope for the future, 
is immediate housing, and they won't have that at the pace at which the 
reconstruction is proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
For family oriented Armenians, the loss of their homes was more than the loss 
of shelter, Laura Vartanyan, first deputy chairman of the Armenian Children's 
Fund, said, because it also meant the loss of the family's cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians draw strength from the family -- children from their parents, 
parents from the children, everyone from the grandparents," she said. "The 
family is always a source of hope for the future, of wisdom in difficult times, 
of belonging when modern life is so full of alienation. . . . The family for us 
is the center. 
</P>
<P>
"But with more than 25,000 people killed in the earthquake, we have that many 
families that are deeply grieving. We also have perhaps 100,000 other families 
without housing, tens of thousands of families in which the women and children 
have been sent around Armenia and around the Soviet Union. This provides them 
with the shelter they need, but it means that as a family they are divided. In 
its aftermath, the earthquake for us as a nation remains a crisis because of 
the danger it poses to so many of our families." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Divided on Response 
</P>
<P>
Armenian officials are divided on whether to house as many people as possible 
in quickly built, prefabricated houses and then proceed with an orderly but 
slower reconstruction, or whether to press ahead with the whole redevelopment 
effort, even though it might leave some families housed in shacks, shanties, 
portable cabins, dormitories, school buildings and even tents for several more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in putting up more temporary housing only to replace it in a 
year or two or three -- that is a loss of time as well as money," Yuri 
Mkhitarian, a senior official of the Armenian State Construction Committee, 
commented in Yerevan, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"People must realize that we lost more than 11% of the republic's housing in 
the earthquake, plus a lot of enterprises and community facilities, and we will 
not replace those overnight. The whole situation is critical, not only 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
But the need for housing is undeniably urgent, according to Goenjian, Vartanyan 
and others concerned with the social and psychological rehabilitation of the 
victims as well as the physical reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Although there was the shock of the earthquake and everything that happened 
then, most people had a high degree of expectation that things would settle 
down, and many in fact believed they would quickly resume their previous 
functions," Goenjian said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not happening -- whether the expectations were realistic is another 
question -- and so there is a kind of psychological 'aftershock,' if you will, 
and it is a growing problem. Psychological morbidity will increase if families 
remain separated and if families remain away from their homes for a prolonged 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Goenjian has urged the authorities to reunite families and to provide ways for 
them to take part in the reconstruction of the earthquake zone, particularly in 
their villages or neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the population in the earthquake area, which included Armenia's 
second-largest city, Leninakan, the towns of Spitak and Kirovakan and about 60 
villages, are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, according to 
Goenjian and Armenian health workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are recurrent fears of the earthquake being repeated," Goenjian said. 
"People re-experience the earthquake, sometimes every day. They are easily 
startled, any noise from a passing truck, flickering lights or an unexpected 
vibration -- and the tremors are continuing in the area -- will trigger these 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole series of problems, those usually associated with 
post-traumatic stress syndrome, including insomnia, nightmares, apathy, 
detachment, avoidance behavior, as people attempt to protect their psyches from 
further damage and traumas. Children suffer from regression, including 
stuttering, bed-wetting, thumb-sucking. There is increased alcoholism, chemical 
abuse, aggression. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the population, in short, suffers from mild to severe 
post-traumatic stress syndrome. Thirty percent of the population suffer 
significantly as well from grief depression, in which they have a sense of 
hopelessness, guilt, a wish to die." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double Trauma for Some 
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable are the children, the elderly, those who were buried in the 
rubble, who lost limbs in the disaster and who handled corpses. There are also 
those, Goenjian said, who suffered from the "double trauma" of having fled in 
terror from anti-Armenian pogroms in neighboring Azerbaijan only to be caught 
in the earthquake here. 
</P>
<P>
The problems appear most acute in Leninakan, which had a population of more 
than 330,000, and in the larger towns. In rural areas, farmers have gone ahead 
with the rebuilding faster, according to Armenian officials, and life is 
returning to normal there more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic," said Albert Sarkisian, the 65-year-old patriarch of an 
extended family of nearly 20 people in one of Spitak's outlying villages. "Our 
home was destroyed -- a big, beautiful house of Armenian stone. Seeing those 
ruins was worse for me than the earthquake itself, because it was the house 
where I was born and lived my entire life. But we will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"The authorities wanted us to leave -- me because I am old, and the women and 
the children too. But we have a huge family, and we did not want to be 
scattered around the country like leaves. So we stayed here, and it was better 
for us that we did, staying together to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
Goenjian, an Armenian-American, believes that short-term treatment by Armenian 
mental health specialists, who have developed special programs and are working 
with him and other Armenian psychologists from the United States, Britain and 
France, as well as the natural resilience of Armenians like Sarkisian will help 
most to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians do not, by and large, have many mental health problems," Goenjian 
said. "The family is a good support system for most day-to-day psychological 
stresses, but the earthquake crushed this natural support system. The mother, 
on whom everyone depends, has her own losses and cannot provide all the care to 
her children and husband, just as teachers in school cannot help the children 
as they usually do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mental Health Problems 
</P>
<P>
Given the extent of the disaster, he expects "significant numbers" of people to 
develop chronic mental health problems, including pronounced pessimism, 
depression, anxiety, psychosomatic illnesses, alcoholism and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"As an Armenian, I am worried about the long-term impact of the earthquake and 
the aftermath on the character of our people," he said. "A very significant 
number of Armenians will be suffering from problems that will make it difficult 
to form the strong personal relations that are typical of our people, that will 
make them inadequate parents, that will increase chemical dependencies of 
various types, that will make them suspicious and anxious." 
</P>
<P>
Leonid Gozman, president of a new association of Soviet clinical psychologists, 
also sees serious danger of prolonged mental health problems among Armenians if 
measures are not taken quickly to overcome the present psychological and social 
problems here. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who happened to witness the disaster, their relatives and, in fact, all 
Armenians had the feeling that the catastrophe was global," Gozman commented in 
Moscow recently, warning that the problems should not be minimized and that 
government policies should take account of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Even war veterans told me that they had never seen so many people perish so 
quickly. The earthquake took an appalling toll of lives in just about 20 to 30 
seconds. From afar, you cannot even imagine the scale of this holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
And for many Armenians, some of whose parents or grandparents had fled from 
Turkey during the 1915 massacre of Armenians, this revived the fears, never 
forgotten, that despite a history that goes back centuries, they are in danger 
of disappearing as a people. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Armenian history is one of pain, yes, but also one of achievement and one 
of joy," Vartanyan said at the Children's Fund offices, "and we draw tremendous 
strength from it. We have these inner resources that we must activate. We can 
survive; we will survive. And we must not give in to pessimism."

CHINA OUSTS ITS CULTURE MINISTER, APPOINTS HARD-LINER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Culture Wang Meng, who for three years presided over a gradual 
liberalization in Chinese arts, has been fired, and a leading hard-line 
official has been appointed to act in his place, Chinese media announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency reported that Wang, 54, a respected author, 
had asked to step down "to concentrate on writing and literary criticism." 
</P>
<P>
But Wang's removal, which had been rumored for days, is widely viewed as part 
of a continuing purge of reformist officials associated with former Communist 
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was removed from his post in June 
after opposing the use of martial-law troops to suppress student-led 
pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, news services reported that the governor of Hainan 
province, Liang Xiang, has also been fired. Liang, 70, also an associate of 
Zhao, is the highest-level provincial official to be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said his firing would have implications for foreign investors 
and for China's economic reforms, because Hainan had been slated to take the 
lead in the country's experiments with capitalistic forms of trade and 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Communist Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po, which reported Liang's 
dismissal Sunday, said the governor is under investigation for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replaced by Hard-Liner 
</P>
<P>
Wang's replacement apparently will be He Jingzhi, a recently appointed vice 
minister of culture, who is a poet but whose reputation is primarily that of a 
hard-line propagandist. 
</P>
<P>
He, who most recently has been deputy head of the Communist Party Propaganda 
Department, had served previously as a vice minister of culture. He was 
reappointed to that post last week and was also named acting head of the 
ministry, state-run television reported Monday. He also has been named head of 
the Communist Party structure within the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Wang, who became minister of culture in 1986, encouraged a loosening of 
controls on literature and the arts. Among the most dramatic symbols of the new 
openness were several controversial art shows in Beijing during the last year, 
including one devoted entirely to paintings of nudes. 
</P>
<P>
He, in contrast, has been a leading advocate of ideological orthodoxy. He 
played key roles in promoting a 1983 campaign against "spiritual pollution" and 
an "anti-bourgeois liberalization" drive in 1987. Both campaigns were aimed at 
attacking Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Wave of Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Since this June's crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators, and Zhao's 
fall from power, a new wave of criticism has been launched against pornography 
and any literature viewed as advocating allegedly decadent foreign life styles. 
This new campaign now is likely to get a further boost from He. 
</P>
<P>
"Literary and art circles are part of the ideological front," He declared in an 
April, 1987, speech, during the height of that year's anti-bourgeois 
liberalization campaign. "Our opposition to bourgeois liberalization is aimed 
at strengthening our Marxist world outlook and our Marxist concept of 
literature and art. . . . We must advocate depicting the bright side of things 
and depicting advanced and heroic figures. Only by doing so can we inspire the 
people to stride forward." 
</P>
<P>
He is considered a protege of former Propaganda Minister Deng Liqun, a 
hard-line ideologue who has been in semi-retirement since 1987 but who remains 
one of the orthodox figures most feared by reformist intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese say that Deng, who was removed from the Communist Party Central 
Committee in 1987, has recovered considerable political clout since the June 
crackdown.

W. BERLIN STRIVING TO FIND BEDS FOR E. GERMANS 
</P>

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in West Berlin's main refugee reception center scrambled Monday to 
provide an extra 1,000 beds for the influx of East Germans they expect to 
arrive in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the tent camps being hastily put up in Bavaria near the Austrian border, 
the additional beds here will be in permanent buildings, center director Harald 
Fiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 240 separate locations in West Berlin where we are putting up refugees 
from Eastern Europe," he said, pointing to a map in his office in the 
Marienfelde district. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very short on accommodations in West Berlin, but we heard that 10,000 
to 15,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary may be coming to West Germany any 
day -- so we have to do our part, too." 
</P>
<P>
All the refugee facilities in West Germany are sorely overtaxed, and 
Marienfelde is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 East Germans and ethnic Germans from Poland and the Soviet Union 
are currently being housed temporarily in West Berlin, with the average stay 
being about nine months, Fiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the luckiest newcomers are those from East Berlin since they are only 
moving across town -- even if by way of Hungary and Austria -- and West Berlin 
is much less of a wrench for them than it is for ethnic Germans from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"Those from Poland were not able to learn German in school so they must be 
taught the language," said the 42-year old Fiss, who has been dealing with 
refugees for four years at the center, which resembles a low-rise public 
housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have greater difficulties finding jobs and apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Polish Germans are sometimes scorned by those from East Germany -- as 
well as by West Berliners -- as somehow only second-class Germans, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
And all the refugees face intense competition among West Berliners, and its 
large Turkish population, for jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rain at Campsites 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the West German government awaited the expected influx of East 
Germans from Hungary, having set up several sprawling tent camps in Bavaria 
with a capacity of 4,500 people. But heavy weekend rains have made their 
habitability questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Some local Bavarian newspapers described the conditions in the tent camps as 
primitive. 
</P>
<P>
And on Monday the German magazine Stern released an interview with Hungarian 
Interior Minister Istvan Horvath, in which he said that both the East German 
and West German governments would have to reach agreement on the refugees 
before Budapest would allow them to cross the Austrian border. 
</P>
<P>
Horvath said that, given the hard-line position of East Germany, such a 
solution to the refugee crisis could take up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany wants Hungary to observe a bilateral agreement not to let East 
Germans cross into Austria without proper exit documents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not up to us to persuade East Germany to agree to a solution," Horvath 
told Stern. "West Germany should do that." 
</P>
<P>
In the refugee center here, one family, which asked not to be identified by 
name, took the long way round from East Berlin to West Berlin last week. The 
family consists of a man and wife, a son, a daughter and her fiance -- all of 
whom lived in the Pankow district of East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Like many others fleeing East Germany, the family is young and skilled: the 
parents are in their late 30s; he is a factory foreman; the children are in 
their late teens; the prospective son-in-law is an electrician, the sort of 
people the Communist regime cannot easily afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"We got fed up with the lack of political rights," said the father, who wore a 
colorful sweater and slacks. "There was no possibility of travel, except to 
Eastern Europe; there was no free press to read or television to watch. We had 
no information on what was going on in China. 
</P>
<P>
"We could see the news on the West Berlin station but not from our own media. 
We thought the country was getting more regimented: soldiers, discipline, 
militarized schools, even sports were that way." 
</P>
<P>
His wife added: "You could never get what you wanted in the stores. Everything 
was unavailable or too expensive -- fruits, vegetables, meat. We had difficulty 
getting food with vitamins." 
</P>
<P>
Sensing no liberalization to come, the family secured vacation visas for 
Hungary and drove off in their small, four-door Wartburg sedan, which they had 
waited 10 years to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived at a camping site near the Austrian border and there met a helpful 
Austrian vacationer who gave them a map delineating an area at the border that 
he said was unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
"We made up our minds the first night," the husband said. "We left everything 
behind -- our car, our tents, our heavy baggage -- and took only things we 
could carry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Austrian Pointed the Way' 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian drove them to a woods less than two miles from the frontier and 
pointed the way. The father had a good field compass and used it to direct the 
family to the wire fence along the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
"The fence was still up," he said, "but we found a big hole in it, made by the 
Austrians, I think. We heard some warning shooting by border guards in the 
distance, but it was not directed at us. So we slipped through the fence. The 
Austrians had put out welcome signs so we knew we were out of Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
That was a week ago: the family got a lift to Vienna and travel documents and 
tickets at the West German Embassy there, allowing them to go the Schoeppingen 
camp in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But because they are East Berliners and have relatives in West Berlin, they 
qualified to come to Marienfelde here. 
</P>
<P>
"We like Berlin," the father said. "Why go anywhere else? I think we'll find 
jobs and places to live before too long."

AUTHORITIES HOLD BOY, 2, WHO WANDERED FROM CARSON HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old boy found alone on a park bench Sunday will not be reunited with 
his mother until today so that child welfare workers can determine why the boy 
wandered away from his Carson home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The toddler, Filipo Talosaga, walked out the back door of his family's 
condominium sometime after 9 a.m., according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Deputy Chris Wahla. His mother had left him in the care of a 14-year-old niece 
who was also watching three other children. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, Filipo was found two blocks away by a passing motorist who 
spotted the boy sitting alone on a bench at Avalon and Sepulveda boulevards, 
Wahla said. The unidentified motorist took the boy to a guard's station at a 
condominium complex, where sheriff's deputies picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother, Taumalatou K. Talosaga, 22, arrived at the station about 2 
p.m. to pick up her son, but was told that he would be kept at MacLaren 
Juvenile Hall in El Monte until today, when caseworkers from the Los Angeles 
County Department of Children's Services will try to determine why Filipo left 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Wahla said that before children who leave home can be returned to their 
families, the children's services department must conduct an investigation.

The quake, measured at magnitude 6.9, was centered 70 miles southeast of 
Chignik. The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a tidal wave warning for 
coastal Alaska and British Columbia, but the resulting wave was less than 6 
inches high at Sand Point, Alaska. Workers at the Tesoro Refinery in Kenai, 400

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
ONE-STOP PERMIT PROGRAM TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's one-stop shopping, one-stop photo finishing and one-stop banking. Now 
there's one-stop permit processing. 
</P>
<P>
A ribbon-cutting on Wednesday will mark the official opening of Irvine's 
program to "cut the red tape" out of permit processing. City officials say 
construction and development permits, which typically take four to six months 
to obtain, can now be snagged in "substantially less" time by using the new 
One-Stop Permit Processing Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. and Bob Johnson, director 
of community development, are among the expected guests at the ribbon-cutting. 
The ceremony is planned at 2 p.m. in the Community Development Lobby of the 
Irvine Civic Center, 1 Civic Center Plaza.

DIRECTIONAL PROBLEM FOR RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
ON AND OFF THE FIELD, WHERE ARE THEY HEADED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of appearances, every exhibition season carries some blessing. 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, this summer's is the gift of humility. At least they won't go 
into the season cocky. 
</P>
<P>
There were few others. If once they were known for their famous commitment and 
gnarly reputation, they've turned into something else: a house divided, not to 
mention, on wheels. An organization trying to figure out where it's going, on 
and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
You want a metaphor for their summer? Try their newest line of caps and 
souvenirs, which bear only the name, "Raiders." No Los Angeles, Oakland, 
Sacramento or Parts Unknown. Meet your Generic Raiders, preparing once more, in 
Al Davis' immortal phrase, to strike terror into opponents' hearts, from 
whatever venue. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its problems, as recently as two seasons ago this football operation 
was continuity, itself. Now, everything is done on the fly. From last season's 
opener, there are new starters at 16 positions -- eight on offense, eight on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the new coach, Mike Shanahan, saw his veteran quarterback, Marc 
Wilson, depart in a holdout squabble; started camp with one offensive line; got 
a better line by the season opener, and then saw that line torn apart to get 
another veteran quarterback who arrived too late to be of much use. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the new defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, replaced five of last 
season's starters . . . and then saw one of his new first-stringers, Otis 
Wilson, waived in the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Robinson, projected to switch to the key middle linebacker position, has 
a groin pull and hasn't yet lined up at the position. The team spent two weeks 
debating whether to cut Matt Millen, the only Pro Bowler on defense last 
season, in favor of Miami's long-time prospect-gone-bust, Jackie Shipp. 
</P>
<P>
Millen also functioned as the team's defensive quarterback and Raider veterans 
stuffed their fists in their mouths and held their breaths. 
</P>
<P>
Monday they got the word. Millen was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," a veteran said, "it's a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is still out with a groin pull, so the Raiders will start with Shipp, 
playing with a broken bone in one hand. Their linebacking corps for the opener 
features Greg Townsend (an end last season), Shipp (a Dolphin), Thomas Benson 
(a San Diego Charger) and Emmanuel King (a Cincinnati Bengal). 
</P>
<P>
For veterans, the cuts became a weekly downer as long-time teammates and others 
with high salaries went one after another: Todd Christensen, James Lofton, Mike 
Haynes, Millen, Wilson and Mike Richardson. The savings were $3.7 million on 
those players alone. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition games were a mess. Stunned by Stacey Toran's death, the Raiders 
sleep-walked through a rout by the San Francisco 49ers and never seemed to 
catch up. 
</P>
<P>
They went 0-4 for the first time in their history, or as the San Diego Union's 
Chris Jenkins wrote, "Just winless, baby." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was it just a matter of meaningless exhibitions wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
A team's control of the line of scrimmage is basically defined by how well it 
plays the run, as opposed to how well it runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders averaged 57.5 yards a game and 2.9 yards a carry . . . and allowed 
179.5 and 4.8. This is the basic definition of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how shaky, exhibition season is only exhibition season and the 
Raiders are assuredly better than that. Aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
If anything works out, it will have to be the new Raider Way -- on the fly or 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Just wing it, babies. 
</P>
<P>
How did they get into this mess? 
</P>
<P>
It goes back to Tom Flores' resignation after the 5-10 finish in 1987 and 
Davis' need to go outside the organization for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Though Flores has never protested that his departure was anything but 
voluntary, there are reasons to believe it wasn't all his idea. He had never 
given the slightest hint of wanting out. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, Davis suggested politely that this might be the time and Flores, the 
good soldier, acceded. A Raider insider tells another story: that Davis 
insisted that Flores fire his offensive assistants and Flores elected to resign 
first. In fact, four offensive assistants were let go as soon as Flores left. 
</P>
<P>
It was an important moment in Raider history, because for the first time, Davis 
didn't think he had a head coaching candidate on the staff. Besides, he was 
open to the idea of bringing in new blood to update basic Raider philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
He soon encountered trouble. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate, then-Washington Redskin assistant Dan Henning, dropped out by 
mutual agreement with Davis. Henning told friends that he'd wanted to change 
the offense and Davis wasn't going for it. 
</P>
<P>
Another Redskin assistant, Joe Bugel, promptly took himself out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
This left only Shanahan, who was hired. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lesson here. On his first journey outside, Davis couldn't find 
anyone willing to go down the line on Raider orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan thought his only commitment was that he wouldn't throw anything out 
without thinking about it first. In fact, he threw a lot out and put in a 
Denver-style look-short-first passing attack with lots of motion and 
formations. Davis hated it and told his many confidantes throughout the league. 
By midseason, Davis' displeasure was an open secret, starting the 
power-struggle theory. 
</P>
<P>
"What power struggle?" Shanahan said at the time, laughing. "He's got all the 
power. I've got all the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has since made it public. At the spring league meetings in Palm Desert, 
he told a group of writers: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I had a young coach who went in a direction I didn't necessarily want. 
But he went. Sometimes in life, you let them go . . . It wasn't what I'd hoped 
we'd do or what I thought we were going to do, but I think we're where we want 
to be now." 
</P>
<P>
They're where some of them want to be, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider-Bronco rivalry produced a predictable tension among the old Raider 
assistants and the new ones from Denver. After an unhappy season, Shanahan 
fired one of the unhappiest holdovers, quarterback coach Tom Walsh, but Davis 
cancelled the order. When Davis heard that receivers coach Nick Nicolau asked 
Art Shell why the holdovers were sticking around when they weren't wanted, he 
canned Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned the hard way about the Raider Way, Shanahan redesigned an 
offense more to Davis' liking. The Raiders shift less and throw long more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Davis also insists on the offense working. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan still looks like he did his first day on the job: bright-eyed, 
dedicated, confident and personable. Charlie Sumner, the defensive coordinator 
he fired, later claimed that Shanahan came unglued on the sideline, but if he 
did, it couldn't have been a total surprise; he was a rookie head coach in a 
deteriorating situation under immense pressure. Off the field, Shanahan's poise 
was exemplary. With everything bearing down on him, the press corps never 
witnessed a single lash-out. 
</P>
<P>
So now he's a second-year coach under immense pressure. There is speculation 
that he must show more or Davis will can him, too. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph, the new defensive coordinator, is not as well-known. Reticent around 
writers in Cleveland, where the Browns had no objection to assistants talking, 
he's a lost cause as a public figure in this organization, which does object. 
</P>
<P>
Like Shanahan, Adolph has a reputation as sharp and intense. His Cleveland 
defenses were tough and combative, even without a lot of star players. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph has been told to put the attack back into the Raider defense. He has 
installed a multiple-front scheme, sliding back and forth between a 3-4 and 4- 
3, using the new linebacker, Townsend, as the swing man. 
</P>
<P>
Raider players like what he's shown them, but they've been used to the simplest 
of schemes and have yet to get this one down. Transitions such as this can take 
time, but they're plumb out of that. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at the playing roster, you still think it's a good team. 
</P>
<P>
A receiving corps of Tim Brown, Willie Gault, Mervyn Fernandez and the 
promising Mike Alexander? Should be as good as any in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder and Steve Beuerlein at quarterback? They're at least as good as 
anything here since Jim Plunkett cleared age 35. 
</P>
<P>
A defense with Townsend, Howie Long, Robinson, Vann McElroy and Bob Golic? 
That's the reigning conference sack leader plus four guys with 11 Pro Bowl 
appearances among them. 
</P>
<P>
In this game, however, you're only as good as you are cohesive. The Raiders 
haven't been recently. 
</P>
<P>
Several questions remain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What about the defense? 
</P>
<P>
They have to hope Robinson will be back soon . . . and can make the switch, or 
that Shipp finds himself at last. The new corners, Lionel Washington and Terry 
McDaniel, heirs to the mantle of Haynes-Hayes, have to live up to their promise 
and stay healthy. The strong safety, newly-converted Zeph Lee, who is willing 
but often lost, has to hang in there until injured Russell Carter returns. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, with Millen, Haynes, Toran and Rod Martin gone, with eight 
new starters from last season's opener, they have to find themselves in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What about Marcus Allen? 
</P>
<P>
The acknowledged leader of Raider team leaders, voted most valuable player four 
times in five years -- while playing hurt throughout three of them -- he got 
nothing out of his holdout. There were no talks, no promises to renegotiate, 
not as much as a returned phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Can he come back and play as before? 
</P>
<P>
They'd better hope so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The offensive line? 
</P>
<P>
It's big (the lightest is 275-pound John Gesek) and young (the oldest is Don 
Mosebar, 27). From center to right tackle, it's blue chip: No. 1 pick Mosebar, 
No. 2 pick Steve Wisniewski, No. 2 pick Bruce Wilkerson. On the left side, Rory 
Graves and Gesek are a free agent and No. 10 pick respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The line needs to stay healthy and come together. That 2.9-yard rushing average 
can't all be due to Allen's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What about Schroeder? 
</P>
<P>
He has to be more the way he was in the Chicago Bear exhibition, less like the 
first three. This team can't carry a struggling quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders haven't won a postseason game since 1984 -- the Super Bowl victory 
over the Washington Redskins in Tampa. They haven't been in one in three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bet on four.

HOLD THE TINSEL;

<P>
EVERETT ISN'T THE HOLLYWOOD TYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterbacks were never meant to lead lives of quiet desperation. Bob 
Waterfield married Jane Russell. Later, in a commercial, Joe Namath tried on 
her brand of stockings. Dan Pastorini raced cars, and was stopped by a few with 
flashing red lights. 
</P>
<P>
When John Elway arrived in Denver, reporters followed him to the barber shop to 
chronicle what one town considered the most famous haircut since Elvis' 
induction to the Army. 
</P>
<P>
So who lead the National Football League in touchdown passes in 1988 with 31? 
Marino? Montana? Elway? Lomax? 
</P>
<P>
No, Jim Everett of the Rams. Although most days you would never know he was in 
a media capital. Imagine Joe Montana riding through the streets of San 
Francisco in an open-air Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
First, a few differences between Hollywood and the upper west side of Stanton, 
where Everett lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not L.A.," Everett says of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But it says Los Angeles right there on your team's letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference," Everett says, "and that's just fine with me. I can 
just jump in my Jeep and have a grand old time." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Elway sneezes in Denver -- and gets in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize in Denver they don't have much else to write about," 
Everett says. "Here, there's a ton of things going on. There's the Dodgers, 
there's Magic Johnson and the Lakers and who the Clippers drafted and couldn't 
sign. All that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
A while back, Everett and some buddies landed in a Buena Park theme restaurant 
where customers dress in medieval costumes and partake in such traditions as 
gnawing cooked leg of oxen while watching simulated jousting between simulated 
knights. 
</P>
<P>
"I put on a damn crown and rooted for the blue section and no one even came up 
to me for an autograph," Everett said. "I was sitting there with this goofy 
crown on, starting every chant possible and having a ball with my friends. 
There were kids everywhere, and not a single person asked me for an autograph. 
I don't know if it was because the crown was so ugly that no one recognized me 
or what. But it was really fun." 
</P>
<P>
After a few years in Irvine, Eric Dickerson fled for Malibu to get closer to 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
For Everett, that night in Buena Park was action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not this person you're going to see parachuting out of a plane," Everett 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has a very private side, to which you're not invited, but it's not the 
stuff of newspaper tabloids. Years of investigation into Everett's life might 
lead you to an uneventful conclusion: He seems like a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
"If a reporter said he wanted to spend seven days a week with me, every minute, 
I'd say 'No way,' " he said. "I ain't that exciting for one, and two, it's just 
not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Everett embodies the qualities of suburban life style. He's as noncontroversial 
as the weather. 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County seems an endless string of tract homes, malls and fripperies, 
then Everett is frozen yogurt. Like Gertrude Stein, you sometimes wonder if 
there's a there there. 
</P>
<P>
The public Everett is patient, kind, courteous, ever-smiling. He is a native of 
Albuquerque, the son of educators. His father, James, teaches special education 
at the University of New Mexico. His mother, Bonnie, teaches at the elementary 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Everett brought home a bad report card -- once. 
</P>
<P>
"They really didn't have to say anything," he said. "They just looked at me." 
</P>
<P>
And that was that. Everett pressed on and became a member of the National Honor 
Society, and later, All-Academic Big Ten at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
The public Everett has poured time and energy into the community, recently 
establishing the Jim Everett Foundation in Orange County. He's paying more than 
lip-service to charity, taking hands-on responsibilities for all the 
foundation's projects. His charities raised nearly $120,000 last year, most of 
the mony going to Drug Use is Life Abuse. Next up is a canned-food drive for 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a genuinely nice man," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "I think he's 
going to live his life and do a lot of good things. 
</P>
<P>
The public Everett has the gift of saying things without saying much at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as thin as a blade," he says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Blade, in fact, is Everett's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
The public Everett is calculatedly boring, so as to not divert attention away 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be remembered as 'Hey, that was the guy who wore the 
headband,' " he says. "Or that's the guy who said this about that guy. Or 
that's the guy who thinks we should bomb Iran. I have my opinions about that 
stuff. And if you ever want to get into them someday, I'll tell you my beliefs 
on religion and politics. But that's not what I want to be remembered for. I 
want to be remembered at some point as being the best quarterback the Rams have 
had. And that's a big step. It's something that won't come easy. We've had guys 
like Waterfield and Gabriel." 
</P>
<P>
In one of his parting shots, Dickerson called Everett an "organizational pimp," 
insisting he kowtowed to management's whims. Everett, naturally, had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The private Everett recently purchased a sprawling, ranch-style home in rural 
Orange Park. He likes to hunt and fish and take long walks on the beach at 
night. He has a steady girlfriend, Kristina Beatty, whom he met while he was at 
Purdue and she at Indiana. Everett also is head-over-heels about a new golden 
retriever, Gunner, who doesn't yet follow a quarterback's orders as well as Ram 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The private Everett is not beyond telling a spicy joke, chewing tobacco and 
having a few beers with friends. But it's his mission in life to never become a 
news headline. He has never done drugs, he says, and when he does have a few 
too many beers, he makes sure there's a designated driver. 
</P>
<P>
A star quarterback can't afford to make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can," he says, "Not in this day and age. It's the '90s and it's the 
wrong thing to do. And it's to me the wrong image to have." 
</P>
<P>
But Everett has an ego like any other pro quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
When coaches at Purdue tried to convert Everett to tight end, he refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not accept that," he said. "That to me was failure. Because I was a 
quarterback. I truly saw myself as a quarterback, and I wasn't going to let 
some so-called specialist tell me I wasn't. I wanted to prove myself to the 
point where someone said, 'We don't want you anymore.' I've always been 
determined. And when it's not football someday, I guarantee you it'll be 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
The private Everett also is driven by the opportunity to grow in the pass 
offense coordinated by coach Ernie Zampese. Last year, in only his second full 
season as an NFL starter, Everett established Ram records for passes attempted 
(517), passes completed (308), yardage gained (3,964), touchdown passes (31), 
and most touchdown passes in a game (five). 
</P>
<P>
Everett is consumed by football. He hangs out at Rams Park on his days off, 
making no apologies to those who think that makes Jim a dull boy. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a guy who works on Wall Street," he says. "He gets up in the morning, 
he eats, and he's already thinking about Wall Street and what he's going to do 
with his money. And he doesn't get home until six o'clock. I just happen to be 
putting all that into football." 
</P>
<P>
The private Everett lives for Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"They always expect quarterbacks to be big risk-takers," he says. "My idea of 
living life on the edge is competing on Sunday. That brings me more thrill than 
anything I can do in life. I realize that's where it's at and that's what I 
concentrate on. I realize there are other things in life that just can't match 
that. I don't think a cocaine high, and I've never done drugs, can match that 
feeling on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
It helped that Everett knew this was his team from the minute he arrived in a 
trade with Houston in 1986. At first, some thought he was a little too slick, 
too bubbly -- a guy who perhaps tried to press all the right buttons too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came, he was a bit of a kid," Robinson said. "But he's maturing into a 
man now. I think he's a great, great guy for this team. I spent a lot of time 
trying to figure him out, to guide him. But I never felt he was headed in the 
wrong direction. I felt he might have been a degree off. When he first came, he 
was almost effervescent." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Everett has managed to bridge the distance between his star status and 
that of his teammates. But that becomes increasingly difficult as his star 
continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Everett enters the last year of a contract that pays $450,000 this season and, 
unlike so many of his teammates, finds himself with enormous negotiating 
leverage. The Rams must sign Everett before Feb. 1 or risk losing him to 
restricted free agency, at which time any team could sign Everett for two 
first-round draft choices -- a small price to pay for such a precious 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
That won't happen, of course. The Rams will renegotiate his contract during the 
season, but on Everett's terms. And the going rate for top quarterbacks in the 
NFL these days is about $2 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
Everett hopes this doesn't cause a class struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blind," he said. "If a guy happens to start a shirt company and makes 
millions, you hope he doesn't change. But sometimes he does. I don't want to. I 
think the values of what my parents taught me, being educators, helps. It's 
what you are that makes you. I'm the same old idiot that showed up here the 
first day and hopefully I'll be the same old idiot that leaves here when I go." 
</P>
<P>
But as Everett improves, new pressures await on the horizon. Word may travel 
slowly out of Orange County, but the football world is catching on. Everett is 
getting stopped in movie lines now and recently landed a bit part in a Bo 
Jackson commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"His face is starting to pop up on TV," Robinson said. "And if we go to the 
Super Bowl and win it he's a national figure. Sure, that affects you. That's 
why I think it's so important to be well grounded. Make no mistake, a person 
like Jim Everett or any of these people, they have very complicated lives. They 
almost seem to be as vulnerable as the rock musician or the entertainer seems 
to be. Their images and life styles seem to becoming almost similar. Therefore, 
there's more scary parts." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Everett clings to the present and awaits a promising and complicated 
future.

JIM MURRAY: IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE'S PITCHING FOR THE FOREIGN LEGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
The proposition for Mark Langston, the baseball player, is really quite simple: 
does he want to be a left-handed pitcher or a lanceur gaucher? Does he want to 
be known as a strikeout king or le roi des retraits au baton? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he cope with an environment where an earned-run average is a moyenne des 
points merite with an accent over the "e"? Where his fastball is known as the 
rapide and his slider as a glissante? And his curve is spelt courbe? The 
changeup is a changement de vitesse? A walk is a but sur balles? 
</P>
<P>
Does Kevin Mitchell look any easier to pitch to because he's a frappeur instead 
of a power hitter? Is a home run any easier to give up because it's a coup 
circuit? Is it any more comforting to give up a base hit when it's described as 
a coup sur? 
</P>
<P>
Like to see your shutout referred to as a blanchissage. Would you? 
</P>
<P>
French is a beautiful language. I mean, it's got words such as Beaujolais and 
mon petit chou. It's the language of love. 
</P>
<P>
But is it the language of baseball? Does the game lose something in 
translation? Ballplayers who play the game in Montreal tend to feel they're on 
a demonstration tour of southern France. "You never feel as if you have a home 
game," Ron Fairly, who played there for five years and rolled up several 
hundred coups sur, once observed. "The weather was very changeable. It ranged 
from bad to terrible. The announcer used to come on in the morning to predict 
the day would be 'cold and windy with intermittent daylight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston is the curious case of a guy who belongs on Broadway but finds 
himself playing Bridgeport. Or Peoria. Or, as in his case, a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the best pitchers in the grand old game but found himself on the 
mound for the Seattle Mariners. That's like Caruso winding up in a barber shop 
quartet, Laurence Olivier in "Smokey and the Bandit II." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners are less a team than a sitcom. Pitching in the Kingdome is not a 
job, it's a sentence. Four times in its brief history, it has been the home run 
capital of the world. Most of those were hit by the visitors. The "power" 
alleys are a laughable 357 1/2 feet, the foul poles are 316 feet away. Umpires 
have to be careful invoking the infield-fly rule. It might turn out to be a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Finding yourself in the Kingdome with Jose Canseco is like finding yourself in 
an elevator with a lion. Nevertheless, Mark Langston won 19 games in this 
closet in 1987, a year when 218 home runs rattled out in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Langston learned early on the importance of geography. Pitching in that 
glorified tent, Langston won 17 games, led the league in strikeouts, even had 
two shutouts, in 1984, his rookie season. Nobody even looked up. Meanwhile, 
over in New York, another rookie pitcher, Dwight Gooden won the same number of 
games, did not lead the league in strikeouts and only had one more shutout. 
But, he became rookie of the year, Doctor K, and, the next year, Cy Young 
winner. Langston became What'd-you-say-his-name-was-again? 
</P>
<P>
Old What's his name has more lifetime strikeouts than Dr. K. He has led the 
league three times in strikeouts. He struck out 16 in a game (against Toronto) 
last year. He just missed a no-hitter, throwing a one-hit game against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he had to hire a Hollywood publicity firm to get his name in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
He played in the Kingdome on a team that finished last two of the five seasons 
he pitched there and next-to-last in two others. He knew he had to get out of 
there. So, he forced a trade. And he got to go to -- ta, da! -- Montreal! 
</P>
<P>
Now, Montreal is not exactly the show-biz capital of the world. It's a nice 
place to visit, but I wouldn't want to pitch there. At least in Seattle, they 
knew he was a hurler and not a lanceur. And Mark has no great desire to become 
Doctor Retraits Au Baton. He probably knew he was in trouble the minute he 
stepped off the plane and someone addressed him as mon vieux (old friend). The 
trouble with Montreal is their heroes come with hockey sticks attached. 
Everyone else is Coco Laboy. 
</P>
<P>
So, when does Mark What's-His-Name get to play the Palace, trod the boards at 
the Old Vic, so to speak, get on prime time? He needs a compass, not a curve. 
Fame and fortune lies south and Langston seems to be looking for the Northwest 
Passage. One more move and he'll need a dog sled. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal would like to keep him. He's the best lanceur they've got. But the 
Expos would have liked to have kept Andre Dawson, Gary Carter, Rusty Staub and 
Warren Cromartie. They all went over the wall. Tim Raines tried. Andre Dawson 
even signed a blank contract at Chicago rather than go back over the border. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal took a calculated risk in trading for Langston. He becomes a free 
agent at the end of the year. Montreal is hoping he will find their city rich 
in Old World charm. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's gerant (manager), Bob Rodgers, is acutely aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. Everybody wants to play in Southern California or New York," he 
admits. "What we have to do is convince them we have a first-class operation 
here, that it doesn't snow in Montreal in July, and that it just might be one 
of the best places in baseball to win a pennant." 
</P>
<P>
Gerant Rodgers acknowledges lanceur Langston, who has won 10 games for the 
Montreal Expos since his escape from Seattle, will be avidly sought when he 
reaches free agency this fall. "He has great stuff, but he's a pitcher not a 
thrower. He could mean a pennant to a number of teams. I would hope one of them 
would be us." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is unsure. He admits he is pitching this year with his bags packed and 
the car running and double-parked. "But, what I wanted basically was to get 
into a pennant race. I had never been in one and I like having the games mean 
something." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the French word is for pennant. Up to now, of course, they 
haven't needed one up there. If they don't get one this year, the word for 
Langston next year may be au revoir.

ANGELS CONCLUDE NIGHTMARISH TRIP WITH LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All things must pass, even this interminable Angel trip through Kansas City, 
Arlington, Tex., Boston, New York and Hades. At last, it's over -- 15 days, 15 
games and 11 losses. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter than a prison term but long enough to trash what had been, up until 
Aug. 21, a fine season. 
</P>
<P>
How long was this trip, which ended Monday with a 2-1 Angel loss to the New 
York Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
When it began, Chuck Finley was still in the Angel rotation. 
</P>
<P>
When it began, four days in New York still seemed a great way to spend Labor 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When it began, the Angels were still contenders in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving home tied for first place, the Angels return home in third, 4 1/2 games 
behind division leading Oakland and two games back of Kansas City with 25 games 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"This trip was no picnic," said Bill Schroeder, who caught Monday's 
sweep-cinching defeat to the Yankees. "I don't think anybody's giving up. We've 
still got some games to play. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've pinned ourselves into a corner. . . . We were in control of our 
destiny two weeks ago. We aren't any more." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the damage: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Kansas City: The Angels went 1-3. They lost the first three games, and 
Finley before Bert Blyleven temporarily resuscitated them with a 5-0 shutout 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Texas: The Angels went 2-1 . . . and needed a ninth-inning scratch 
single against a weary Nolan Ryan in 90-degree heat to squeeze out a 5-4 
victory in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Boston: The Angels went 1-3. They were outscored, 21-9, in a 
doubleheader on Tuesday and overmatched by Roger Clemens on Thursday. Only Jim 
Abbott's stunning Wednesday night shutout spared the Angels a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At New York: This time, the Angels weren't spared. They went 0-4, swept by 
the sixth-place Yankees. Twice, they lost, 2-1. The winning pitchers in those 
games? Greg Cadaret and Clay Parker. 
</P>
<P>
And who is Clay Parker? 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of June, he had been New York's nowhere man -- winless since July 
1, a span of 12 appearances. Shuttled between the Yankee rotation and bullpen, 
he was 0-3 with a 6.05 earned-run average in his last eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Parker was on the mound Monday was the torn middle fingernail 
on Chuck Cary's pitching hand. Cary, New York's scheduled starter, wound up a 
last-minute scratch and Parker (4-4) wound up stifling the Angels on six hits 
through 7 1/3 innings of floaters and fluffballs. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at a guy like that," Angel Manager Doug Rader said, "and you think 
you're going to score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
Not the way the Angels are going. They scored a run on three singles in the 
first inning -- and were silent for the next eight. In the third inning, they 
managed to put a runner on third base. After that, they nearly went down in 
order, with Parker and Yankee relievers Lee Guetterman and Dave Righetti 
retiring 21 of the Angels' last 24 batters. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, two errors by Angel shortstop Kent Anderson and one swing of Don 
Mattingly's bat would loom large Monday. Anderson botched two grounders in the 
third inning, leading to an unearned run, and Mattingly broke a 1-1 tie in the 
sixth inning with a solo home run, his 18th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to make a loser of Abbott (11-10), the only Angel pitcher to 
win a game on the East Coast phase of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched great," Rader said, finally finding an occasion to trot out that 
superlative. "I'm very, very proud of him . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched well enough to win, but the way we're swinging the bats, we don't 
deserve to win that kind of game." 
</P>
<P>
Rader also absolved Anderson, who opened the third inning by booting Bob 
Geren's ground ball, eventually letting him score from third when he misplayed 
a potential double-play grounder by Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
"In defense of Andy, a lot of times when you make an error like that, it's 
going to open the gates for a three- or four-run inning," Rader said. "This one 
cost us one run. So don't hang it on that kid. We're just not scoring any runs. 
</P>
<P>
"That fact of the matter is, the kid made a couple of errors. But to think he's 
responsible for what happened today, I think, is unfair." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, Rader sat glumly behind his desk. He tried to ward off the 
questions he never wanted to hear with the sunniest words he could find. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in third place. We're still within reach," he said. "Obviously, it's 
been a disappointing trip. We can't be happy with a trip like this. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, this is not going to knock our socks off. These players are 
resilient. They went through a tough period on a very tough trip. They're 
human." 
</P>
<P>
But 4-11? When Rader looked ahead at this admittedly trying task, did he ever 
envision his team going 4-11? 
</P>
<P>
"Do you look at the end of the month and think there's not going to be any 
money in the bank?" Rader replied. "You think you're going to go out on a road 
trip and be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have been out there playing a long time. They've been competing at 
a high level for a long time. When they run into a dry spell, I don't think 
it's appropriate to get down on them." 
</P>
<P>
So now the Angels limp home, facing an uphill climb as steep as their ERA on 
this trip, with no games left against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're going to see what kind of mental constitution we have now," 
Schroeder said. "Are we going to come back, or are we going to give up? 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a betting man -- and I'm not -- I'd think we're going to play some 
pretty good baseball the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got no choice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner was back in the starting lineup Monday, having missed one game 
after his first base collision with Yankee pitcher Greg Cadaret Saturday -- a 
remarkable recovery, considering first impressions. "Initially, I didn't think 
he'd come back the rest of the year," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "But once 
they got him back to the clubhouse and examined him, I thought there was a 
chance he'd play this series. To Wally's credit, he could've played (Sunday)." 
Joyner had two of the Angels' six hits against New York starter Clay Parker, 
including a first-inning single that set up the Angels' only run. Joyner's hit 
advanced Max Venable from first base to third, from where Venable scored on a 
single by Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Until New York, the Angels had dealt reasonably well with the absence of 
regular shortstop Dick Schofield, out with a broken hand. But then came the 
last three games of this series. In Saturday's 2-1 defeat, Kent Anderson failed 
to turn a double play and throw out Steve Sax on a run-scoring infield single. 
In Sunday's 5-2 loss, Glenn Hoffman broke in the wrong direction on a grounder 
off the bat off Hal Morris, turning it into a single that triggered a five-run 
inning for the Yankees. And on Monday, there were Anderson's two errors in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We miss Schofield a great deal," Rader said. "But by the same token, we need 
to give Andy and Hoffy a great deal of credit for going out there and plugging 
along." Anderson, however, was taking recent events a little harder. "I don't 
know how many games we've got left," Anderson said, "but we've definitely got 
to change what we're doing now. At least me, any way." 
</P>
<P>
With Terry Clark 0-2 in two starts as Chuck Finley's replacement, Dan Petry 
will take Finley's next turn in the rotation, scheduled for Wednesday night 
against Milwaukee.

ORIOLES NEED GREAT SEPTEMBER FROM RIPKEN TO WIN DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is September. Children's hour is over. In this season of the Kid-O's, it's 
time for a veteran to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
It so happens the Orioles have the ideal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
You know him. You love him. He has the most famous shoulders in Baltimore. The 
question is: Are they broad enough to carry the Orioles to a division title? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is a better question: Are they broad enough to carry the Orioles to 
an extra-base hit? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the burden of leadership falls to shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. He is, by 
most measures, a superstar. He has the rep. He has the history. And now, 
perhaps more than at any single moment in his career, the Orioles need him to 
live up to that standard. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's too much to ask, but what options are left to the Orioles? Mickey 
Tettleton isn't ready yet to carry anyone. In his first day back from a knee 
injury, he pinch hit Sunday and struck out on four pitches. Keith Moreland, who 
in four at-bats Saturday did not hit a ball past the pitcher's mound, has been 
a bust. Just put him in a museum. Larry Sheets is in the last throes of 
consecutive disastrous seasons. Phil Bradley, slumping anyway, is a run-scorer, 
not a run-producer. 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much leaves Ripken, the team's cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the guy you want up at the plate with the game on the line, or in any 
tough situation," Manager Frank Robinson said of his perennial All-Star. "Right 
now, he's just not producing the way you'd expect or hope. 
</P>
<P>
"We need him. We need someone. One guy can do it. One guy can step forward and 
lead us." 
</P>
<P>
Who, if not Ripken? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect the young players to do that now," Robinson was saying. "What 
you get from (Mike) Devereaux or (Randy) Milligan or (Tim) Hulett or even 
(Craig) Worthington, that's just a bonus. You look for your veterans at this 
time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles must find someone. In their last 44 innings, they've scored six 
runs, with no extra-base hits. Not a bloop double. Not a pop fly that someone 
loses in the lights. And they haven't hit a homer in a week, since Ripken's 
shot last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's game, another big game in what will be a month of big games, the 
Orioles had a shot to catch Toronto Blue Jays, who were, in an upset, losing to 
the Minnesota Twins. But Oriole starter Jeff Ballard wasn't as sharp as usual, 
and the Orioles' bats missed another wake-up call. And yet, there were a few 
chances in what would be a 4-2 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Ripken came to the plate with a runner on second and struck out. 
In the sixth, he had runners on first and third and nobody out and grounded 
into a double play, his team-leading 19th of the season. In the eighth, with a 
runner on, he represented the tying run and flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the pressure," said Ripken, talking about the team's batting 
problems. "It's just a slump." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his production, he said, "I don't want to have to analyze it now." 
</P>
<P>
He has said often that he likes to lead by example. In the field, he may be 
having his best season. No one ever disputes his work ethic. But at the plate, 
he is struggling. Every other week, he changes his stance and you can almost 
sense the frustration he must be feeling. 
</P>
<P>
A look at his recent numbers is not heartening for Oriole fans. He is hitting 
.266 this season and .260 over the last three seasons. He has 41 extra-base 
hits this season, which, if he doesn't pass last year's total of 49, would mark 
his sixth consecutive year of decline. After walking 102 times last year, he 
has drawn only 44 this season, indicating a lack of patience and an attendant 
widening of the strike zone. And although he leads the team with 79 runs batted 
in, he has fewer RBI per at bat than either Worthington or Tettleton. 
</P>
<P>
In the glory years of the not-that-long-ago past, the Orioles had a man who 
could take his teammates by the hand and lead them. This player, who had been 
their greatest run-producer since Robinson himself, was, of course, traded in 
the off-season. Eddie Murray, for better or worse, was one who could carry a 
team. Ripken would often marvel at that particular quality and suggest that he, 
for some reason, couldn't provide that same spark. Murray led, Ripken followed. 
</P>
<P>
While it's true that the Orioles would never have been in contention without 
having traded the contentious Murray, it's true now that they need someone like 
the old Murray. 
</P>
<P>
The only one on the team anything like him is Ripken. He's going to the Hall of 
Fame someday. You can make book on that. When he chose to stay with the Orioles 
last winter instead of looking to a team that might not be in a long rebuilding 
process, it was the first and perhaps most important step on the way back for 
the Orioles. He is their anchor, but can he be their leader?

<P>
Surely, he has many great moments ahead of him. But, if the Orioles are to pull 
off this miracle of a season, they're going to need one great month from him.

MIKE DOWNEY: AT LEAST THE TROJANS DIDN'T HAVE TO FLY HOME FROM MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Moscow could have had this game, as far as Todd Marinovich and the rest of 
USC's Trojans were concerned. The farther away it had been played the better, 
just as the more quickly it becomes forgotten, the better. Because USC lost 
this game of passing-and-rushing roulette. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one consolation about USC's succumbing to Illinois, 14-13, 
Monday night at the Coliseum: Imagine what a plane ride home from the Soviet 
Union would have been like after a loss like this. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's season opener, the one against Penn State? Give it to Kiev. Hold it 
in Chernobyl. Makes no difference. How could a USC season opener be much worse 
than this season's opener? 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich had never mapped it out this way, not in any of his 20 years, not in 
a million years. All he knew on the day he enrolled was that 1989's first snap 
was scheduled to be made in the Soviet Union, and this very fresh freshman 
intended to take it, intended to be the starting quarterback in the first U.S. 
collegiate football game played in the USSR. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the site was changed, even before teammate Pat O'Hara shattered his 
shinbone, Marinovich thought he could be first string. He was uniquely 
qualified: first high schooler to throw for more than 9,000 yards; son of Marv 
Marinovich, captain of USC's 1962 national-championship squad, and nephew of 
Craig Fertig, former USC quarterback and assistant coach. Some pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
Much had been made of the care and feeding of Todd Marinovich, of the way his 
father nurtured him and supervised his elaborate training regimen, of the way a 
California magazine had labeled him literally born and "bred" to be a 
quarterback, as though he were some sort of lab animal. Todd was hardly that. 
He was just a kid who was pleased to have qualified adults take an interest in 
him, a boy who couldn't wait to be big, rather like Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
The first football date of his college life was eagerly anticipated. Marinovich 
was cool, collected, borderline cocky. Freshman quarterbacks ought to be 
borderline cocky. Who needs a scared kid running the offense of a major 
university that has designs on a national championship? 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, it wasn't supposed to turn out this way. Wasn't supposed to end 
with 13 points accumulated on a couple of field goals and a blocked punt. 
Wasn't supposed to end with nine first downs to show for 60 minutes of 
football. Wasn't supposed to end with four sacks and a fairly grotesque 
one-of-16 conversion statistic on third down. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't move the chains," Marinovich said, meaning the first-down 
markers. "And that'll kill you." 
</P>
<P>
That it did. This was not a great day in the life of Todd Marinovich. Four 
years from now, when he is a very fine senior or the next Ken Stabler or 
whatever he turns out to be, maybe he will chuckle and remind everybody of that 
lousy Labor Day back in '89, when everything went haywire. College football is 
a show, remember, that never closes on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith looked on the bright side and said: "I thought Todd 
played fine. I don't think he did anything to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches are not tigers; they do not eat their young. Smith knows that the kid 
knows that he could have done better. He also knows that the kid will do 
better, sooner or later, probably sooner. Even when seasons are only 11 games 
long and every defeat inflicts serious pain, there is no sense pointing fingers 
and losing faith. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, Marinovich's childhood fantasies of winning the big college 
football games could have come true, with just a flip here and a tip there. The 
game was right there in his soft, safe hands, the Trojans holding a 13-point 
edge with only one quarter's worth of football left to play. USC's offense did 
not have the numbers, but at least it had the points. Marinovich was exactly 
where he wanted to be, at the helm and ahead. "All the pressure was over after 
the first snap," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If only he could have pulled a rabbit out of his helmet after Illinois startled 
the Trojans with two touchdowns. This was the time in the football game when 
the quarterbacks Marinovich idolized really went to work, made their miracles 
happen. This was the point in time that might bring out the Marino in 
Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it did not. On the first play after USC lost its lead, Marinovich threw 
an interception. By the time he got the ball back, there were only 54 seconds 
remaining to do something with it, and all he could do was hurl too-short 
completions and last-gasp incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
How had he played? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't win," he said. "That's a sign of how well I played." 
</P>
<P>
Several million Soviets will never know or care what they missed. And several 
million Americans probably won't remember a thing, when the day comes that Todd 
Marinovich puts his first college football game behind him.

A BIT OF ILLINOIS TRADITION CATCHES UP WITH USC; 
</P>
<P>
THIRD WILLIAMS BROTHER TO ESCAPE L.A. COMES HOME AND HELPS BEAT TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Even though Steven Williams lives only 15 miles from the Coliseum, there was 
never any doubt that he would attend Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
After all, his brothers Oliver and David also were wide receivers at Illinois. 
David was a two-time All-American and is one of the best players in the 
Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Still it was homecoming for Steven, and he made the most of it Monday night at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
He caught the winning touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff George with 2 
minutes 19 seconds left. It was a 20-yard throw and it was designed to fool 
USC's senior cornerback Dwayne Garner. 
</P>
<P>
"They (USC's defensive backs) were playing in our hip pocket because we were 
throwing a lot of short passes," Williams said. "Jeff made a pump fake and I 
was open." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the pattern is called 91 stop-and-go, and that's just what he did 
when he went past Garner. 
</P>
<P>
Although Williams plays for a Big Ten team, he says he is a proud Californian. 
</P>
<P>
Williams lives in Hawthorne and attended Serra High School in Gardena, where he 
earned all-state honors while catching nine touchdown passes as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a Catholic high school rather than a public school because I wanted 
to get a better education," Williams said. "As for winning against USC, it will 
give us a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he wasn't totally discouraged when his team trailed the Trojans, 
13-0, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just walked along the sideline and told everyone to keep their heads up," he 
said. "I knew we'd get going." 
</P>
<P>
Williams stressed it was a team victory, but he added that he was thrilled 
because he was playing in front of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was never any doubt that he would go to Illinois, considering the 
tradition his brothers had established. 
</P>
<P>
George, who threw two touchdown passes in the final six minutes, got Illinois 
into its hurry-up offense in its comeback. 
</P>
<P>
His first scoring pass went to wide receiver Shawn Wax, a 53-yard play. The 
ball was tipped by USC linebacker Scott Ross, and Wax came up with the ball, 
then broke a tackle by USC strong safety Cleveland Colter, who was off balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a designed play," George said with tongue in cheek. "I knew that 
someone was going to tip the ball and Wax would come up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Split end Mike Bellamy was the intended receiver on the play, but Ross' tip 
changed the direction of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Coach John Mackovic said his players told him the winning touchdown 
pass to Williams would work. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been throwing underneath a lot and they began to come up on us," he 
said. "Our quarterbacks and wide receivers told me that we were ready for that 
type of fake of a short pass. 
</P>
<P>
"So Steven Williams ran a quick out and went down the the sidelines. It was 
certainly an exciting finish, especially for Steven playing in his home 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
Mackovic said he thought it would be a low-scoring game because of the 
dominating defenses of both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When we fell behind by 13 points in the third quarter, I told our offense that 
they'd have to have a heck of a fourth quarter because we needed two touchdown 
drives," Mackovic said. "We went into our two-minute offense with 6:50 left and 
stayed in it the rest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
So the Big Ten is on a roll with consecutive Rose Bowl victories (Michigan 
State and Michigan) over USC, and now Illinois has beaten the Trojans, who were 
highly ranked in preseason polls and favored to win the Pacific 10 Conference 
championship again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a great conference. We don't have to apologize for it," 
Mackovic said. "The game we played tonight is the game we play eight weeks a 
year in the Big Ten. This was college football at its best." 
</P>
<P>
For Illinois, yes. The Trojans might not agree.

RAIDER PAYROLL CUT, PLUS MILLEN, WILSON, HAYNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the previous Raider cuts had been more glamorous than controversial, they 
made up for lost time Monday when they made a shocking series of both kinds. 
</P>
<P>
Gone were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Haynes. An expected move, but the end for an all-time great cornerback 
and a certain Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matt Millen. A mild surprise. A team leader since the Oakland days who 
started on two Super Bowl teams, he was the defense's only all-pro last season 
and his teammates were openly pulling for him. Millen's departure had been 
widely predicted but Jackie Shipp's broken hand plus Jerry Robinson's 
continuing absence were thought to give him a shot at sticking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Otis Wilson. A stunner. A Plan B signee returning from knee surgery, the 
ex-Chicago Bear linebacker rose to the starting lineup and was praised by Coach 
Mike Shanahan after his first appearance last week in Oakland. He'll be 
replaced in the lineup by another new starter from the Plan B list, 
ex-Cincinnati Bengal Emmanuel King. With Jerry Robinson out, the Raider 
starting linebackers in Sunday's opener against the San Diego Chargers will be 
three Plan Bs plus converted end Greg Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Richardson. Another big surprise. A Plan B cornerback from the Bears, 
he was beaten for three touchdowns in the exhibition season, but Shanahan 
remained high on him throughout camp. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, cutting Richardson leaves only four cornerbacks: the injury-prone 
starters, Terry McDaniel and Lionel Washington, plus Stefon Adams and Dennis 
Price. Adams was tried as a corner for his first two years and switched to 
safety when he struggled. Price, an inexperienced second-year player, missed 
all of camp with a knee injury and only returned to practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the cuts triggered several theories about what's going on: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Al Davis took a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Davis always has ruled personnel decisions, although he seemed to have given 
Shanahan his way a year ago. Two of these moves especially seem notable, since 
Shanahan recently praised Richardson and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Davis is trying to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Almost alone among his peers, Davis has always spent lavishly but he has taken 
grievous losses in recent seasons (a reported $6 million in 1988). The team has 
recently put in several cost-cutting measures and there is speculation that 
Davis has money problems. The players waived Monday represent more than $3 
million in salary. Todd Christensen and James Lofton, who went last week, would 
have made another $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders are playing games. 
</P>
<P>
They may be trying to sneak some of these players through waivers so they can 
keep other players, intending to re-sign the veterans later. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerback position, especially, looks strange. The Raiders now have only 
four, and they play some defenses that use all four, two of whom will have to 
be doubling on special teams as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of these players don't figure to be back. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan suggested that Wilson won't be. 
</P>
<P>
"His knee isn't there yet," Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Millen might not make it through waivers. His salary is $400,000, which is not 
out of line for a starting player, and a lot of coaches like his blood-and-guts 
style. 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything to this theory, it'll show up before Sunday's opener 
against the Chargers. Otherwise, it's a puzzling bunch of cuts, or a new day in 
Raiderdom. 
</P>
<P>
The other cuts: defensive tackle Malcom Taylor ($275,000), rookie cornerback 
Dan Land, rookie quarterback Jeff Francis, quarterback Vince Evans, rookie 
halfback Doug Lloyd, tackle Chris Riehm ($165,000), tight end Charles Henry, 
defensive tackle David Caldwell and ex-USC tight end-turned linebacker Joe 
Cormier.

MISSION VIEJO'S DEFENSE, EL TORO'S OFFENSE ARE BEST OF THE BUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Figuring the favorite in the South Coast League depends upon which side of the 
football Mission Viejo or El Toro high schools line up. 
</P>
<P>
If defense is your forte, defending champion Mission Viejo will win its third 
consecutive title under Coach Mike Rush. Mission Viejo has seven defensive 
starters returning from its 1988 team that allowed 14 points or less in 12 
games before losing to Paramount, 35-32, in the Division III semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, on the other hand, has the league's best quarterback, Steve Stenstrom, 
a stable of fleet running backs and a gifted tight end, Bo Haley, in hopes of 
qualifying for its 11th consecutive berth in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
One team's strength is the other's question mark. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo has only two offensive starters returning and will have 
difficulty replacing its two biggest scoring weapons, slotback Eric Ekdahl and 
quarterback Troy Kopp, off last year's high-scoring team. 
</P>
<P>
When El Toro was last seen in league play, Irvine was piling up 327 yards 
rushing against a Chargers' defense that looked pathetic. El Toro Coach Bob 
Johnson predicts his defense has the potential to be very good, but admits his 
11 starters are young and inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY -- Eric Patton begins his second full season after leading 
the Cougars to a second-place tie with El Toro last year. Patton coached the 
final two games of the 1987 season after Coach Dick Enright was suspended and 
ultimately resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Patton has 12 returning starters, including two-time all-league nose guard 
Damon Psaros and quarterback Tony Solliday. Solliday completed 91 of 159 passes 
for 1,326 yards and eight touchdowns as a sophomore. Running back Chris Adams, 
younger brother of former Cougar standout Tommy Adams, scored six touchdowns 
after being moved up to the varsity midway through league play. 
</P>
<P>
Other top defensive players include Patton's son, Ward, at middle linebacker 
and free safety Jeremy Brion. Patton's youngest son, Scott, will begin the 
season at wide receiver but the sophomore is the team's quarterback of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
DANA HILLS -- The highlight of the 1988 season was a 9-7 victory over 
Capistrano Valley, the school's first against the perennial power in 11 
meetings. Coach Don Douglass called the victory "the highlight of my coaching 
career." Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to push the Dolphins into the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
All-league defensive back Matt Carvalho heads the list of seven returning 
starters. Carvalho doubled at fullback, where he averaged 6.9 yards per carry, 
gaining 424 yards. The team's strength is the defensive line, where ends John 
Kochendorfer and Chuck Briggs and tackle J.J. Ralph return for their senior 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Grant Taylor leads an improved passing attack. Also back is kicker 
Ryan Harrison, who kicked a 36-yard field goal with 11 seconds remaining to 
beat Capistrano Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO -- Coach Johnson enters his 11th season with a record of 102-35 (.744). 
El Toro has won 41 games in the past four years and has qualified for the 
playoffs in 10 consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Stenstrom heads a cast of nine returning starters. Stenstrom 
completed 115 of 205 passes for 1,774 yards and 14 touchdowns in 11 games. 
Tight end Haley will be heavily recruited, and running back Jerome Oakman is 
fully recovered from a broken ankle suffered in the third game last year. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ken Romaniszyn, who had off-season knee surgery, will be limited 
to kicking, but newcomer Carl Stewart, a sophomore transfer from North 
Carolina, could develop into a capable replacement. Stewart was the talk of the 
team's intrasquad scrimmage last week. 
</P>
<P>
The top linemen are guard Kevin Adams and tackle David Cuttrell. The team's 
strength is at the skilled positions, with Haley and Stenstrom among the 
league's best and there's good depth at running back despite the loss of 
Romaniszyn. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE -- A wild 27-26 loss to El Toro in its final game denied Irvine a 
playoff berth last year, but there was some consolation for the Vaqueros. 
Converted split end Shad Vickers emerged as a bona fide running back -- gaining 
158 yards against El Toro -- and returns for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Shackelford, an all-league linebacker as a junior, moves to quarterback 
in his third varsity season. Fullback Matt Steinke teams with Vickers in the 
backfield. The only returning starter on the offensive line is tackle Dean 
Wakeham, a 6-6, 245-pound junior. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine will have a solid defensive secondary with three returning starters -- 
Jim Bassler, Randy Martin and Brandon Krabbe. The team's strength is at running 
back and defensive back, but the passing game is suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree the league is stronger than last year, which means Irvine could be 
left out of the playoffs again despite fielding a good team. 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO -- Seven defensive starters return from a team that went 
undefeated in the regular season and finished as the top-ranked team in the 
county in 1988. Blue-chip seniors Mark Slymen (6-4, 245), Gregg Clapper (6-1, 
215) and Chris Wild (6-2, 236) were all-league selections as juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle George Clark (6-2, 250), another returning starter, is the strongest 
player on the team. Bill Denny, who started as a sophomore, anchors the 
secondary. This is a big, strong and experienced group that opposing teams will 
have difficulty running against. 
</P>
<P>
The offense is another story. Slotback Ekdahl, the state's leading scorer last 
year, is playing baseball at Pepperdine. Quarterback Kopp is vying for a 
starting position at Pacific. The Diablos averaged 28.6 points per game with 
this duo last year. 
</P>
<P>
Only two offensive starters -- wide receiver Mark Gaw and fullback Ryan Darke 
-- return, but Coach Mike Rush thinks the team could be as explosive as last 
year's with a talented group of underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
SAN CLEMENTE -- You can count San Clemente's victories in league play the past 
four years with your thumbs, but third-year Coach Dave Elecciri thinks the 
Tritons will be much improved with 12 returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Wiggins, an honorable mention all-league selection as a junior, heads the 
secondary. Returning defensive linemen include Trey Collum, Rich Tuton, Bobby 
Yoways and Matt Wimpress. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Maldonado and Larry Brophy are experienced running backs, and wide 
receiver Tony Robinson is starting his third season. But the Tritons' success 
will hinge on the play of junior quarterback Ken Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan, an all-league pitcher, has a strong arm and Elecciri is hoping the 
newcomer can eliminate some of the Tritons' costly turnovers that plagued the 
team last year, when it averaged only 7.2 points per game.

In 1969, Mark Parades was an ambidextrous quarterback who played for St. Paul 
High School in Santa Fe Springs. An assistant coach for the Swordsmen that 
season was Dick Bruich, who guided the team's defense and running backs. 
</P>
<P>
The two met again last November, but as opposing coaches in a Southern Section 
Division I quarterfinal matchup, with Bruich coaching Citrus Belt League power 
Fontana and Parades heading Bishop Amat of La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
In arguably the best game of the playoffs, Bishop Amat survived a 28-27 
overtime thriller on its way to the Division final. The Lancers won by stopping 
Fontana's two-point try on the game's last play. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the 1989 Southern Section high school football season opens this 
weekend, Bruich and Parades have the top two teams of the Times' preseason 
Southern Section poll. 
</P>
<P>
Bruich, who is beginning his 13th season, returns an experienced senior 
offensive backfield from last season's 10-2 team. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Nick Bennett, who directed the Steelers' late charge into the 
playoffs last season, leads a talented backfield of running backs William 
Ephriam and Missouri transfer Samita Vaoifi, along with fullback Bobby 
Sylvester. 
</P>
<P>
They will operate behind one of the top-rated lines in Southern California led 
by senior center Roman Guitterez and junior tackles, 6-foot-4, 260-pound Clay 
Hattabaugh and 6-4, 270 Robert Loya. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Fontana's linebackers will be their strength, with Sylvester and 
his younger brother Bryan playing inside and Vaoifi and David Lundy playing 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended last season on a positive note," said Bruich, whose Steelers won the 
Southern Section major division championship in 1987. "We chose to go for two 
and didn't make it. However, this season we have a lot of experience but we 
also have to rebuild our defensive line and secondary." 
</P>
<P>
What Bruich lacks in promotion of his team, Paredes willingly fills in. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Fontana) are definitely the top team," said Parades, who led the Lancers 
to their fourth consecutive Angelus League title last season. "If we had to 
play them to start the season, we'd be overpowered by them because we don't 
compare." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Bishop Amat did not seem to match up to many of its opponents. 
But, the Lancers went 11-3, losing to Fountain Valley, 31-24, in the Division I 
final. Along the way, they defeated such highly touted teams as City 4-A 
champion Carson and Loyola, the top-rated team in the state for most of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Lancers this season are receiver Jeremy Smith and 6-3 
tight end Jason Green. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is regarded as the area's best receiver, also might play tailback, 
so he handles the ball more as the Lancers adjust to new junior quarterback 
Zach Zertuche, who has shown a strong but erratic passing arm. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' defense, which will be led by safety Paul Moetului, is an area of 
concern for Parades, who will have a smaller lineup than last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not as quick as last season and at times, we will be manhandled," 
Paredes said. "However, our overall speed is good." 
</P>
<P>
Paredes expects for Bishop Amat to take its lumps early, with a schedule that 
opens with Rubidoux of Riverside, Carson, Long Beach Poly and Pasadena Muir. 
But, he does not rule out a return playoff matchup against his former coach -- 
Bruich. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to think about our schedule because if I do, it'll drive me to 
drinking," he said. "But, it would be fantastic for us (Bishop Amat vs. 
Fontana) to meet again in the playoffs."

Note -- City begins Sept. 14 
</P>
<P>
With the first official games of the 1989 Southern Section season scheduled for 
Thursday night, here are several interesting questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can Loyola shake off its disappointing finish of last season? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs were perfect for 12 weeks and appeared headed to their first Southern 
Section championship since 1975 before losing, 16-0, to Bishop Amat in the 
Division I semifinals. With a weak Del Rey League schedule and the return of 
injured quarterback Brian Dennis and players Justin Yarro and Keven Dell'Amico, 
Coach Steve Grady and Loyola should rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will this be a down year for LB Poly? 
</P>
<P>
 The highly-regarded Jackrabbits were hurt by injuries last season, which led 
to their first-round playoff loss. Co-coaches Thomas Whiting and Jerry Jaso 
will try to rebuild behind quarterback Eucharis Tupuola and speedy tailback 
Andre Green on offense, and linebacker Willie McGinest on defense. Poly will 
miss All-Division I defensive back Jason Jones, who currently is not enrolled 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who will be the next great back? 
</P>
<P>
 With the graduation of Russell White of Encino Crespi, Curtis Conway of 
Hawthorne and Derek Brown of Anaheim Servite, a void is left. One spectacular 
player returning is Lynwood quarterback Charles Levy. The 6-2 Levy proved to be 
a quadruple-threat last season, scoring touchdowns passing, rushing, catching 
and kick returning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Has there ever been a small-school with more talent than Montclair Prep has 
this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Giannini has to be smiling. Starting with tailback Michael Jones, 
who gained 1,514 yards last season as a junior in becoming one of the country's 
leading recruits, the Mounties have junior fullback Derek Sparks, who 
transferred from City power Wilmington Banning after making first team All-City 
and being named the state sophomore of the year. Joining them will be another 
transfer in junior quarterback Leland Sparks (Derek's cousin from Texas), who 
will direct the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Fountain Valley be one of the worst defending champions? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Milner has only three returning lettermen from last season's 
Division I championship team. Behind the play of quarterback David Henigan, the 
Barons made it to the Division final two consecutive seasons, but with Henigan 
gone, Milner is faced with a major rebuilding task.

FULLERTON COLLEGE FAVORED THIS YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
RECORD-SETTING TAILBACK JEFF ANDREWS RETURNS FOR HORNETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton College publicists like to say the Hornets "came out of nowhere" to 
win the Mission Conference football title last season. 
</P>
<P>
While some may contend last season's success was no surprise, any similar 
accomplishment this season will surprise no one. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is picked first in the conference poll, second in the state poll 
behind Bakersfield and third in USA Today's national poll behind Bakersfield 
and Northeast Oklahoma A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the high regard is Coach Hal Sherbeck and his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Sherbeck enters his 29th season as the winningest community college coach in 
the nation. His career record is 220-61-8, and his Fullerton teams have also 
won 16 conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton went 10-0 in the regular season and 9-0 in the Mission Conference, 
regarded by many coaches as the toughest in the state. The Hornets lost the 
national championship last December when Bakersfield scored a touchdown in the 
final minute to win, 30-24, in the Potato Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
This season's lofty expectations might seem a little out of line for a team 
that has only six starters -- four on offense -- returning. But Sherbeck's 
teams always seem to find ways to win and this season's edition has a big asset 
in tailback Jeff Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews was a redshirt in 1987, when Andrew Greer set the Fullerton 
single-season rushing record with 1,119 yards. Andrews took the field last 
season and shattered the record with ease, gaining 1,520 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard with him all summer to make him a pretty good running back," 
Sherbeck said, joking. "We're happy to have him back. He makes you a pretty 
good coach." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, from Diamond Bar High School, tied Ray Pallares with a team-high nine 
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Nick-John Haiduc and reserve Mike Thomas return at wide receiver. 
Haiduc had 30 catches for 487 yards and three touchdowns, and Thomas had 13 
catches for 227 yards and four touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore David Chisum, an all-county player from Sunny Hills High, will get 
the first shot at quarterback. Chisum completed three of eight passes for 21 
yards last season at Fullerton, but Sherbeck sees qualities in him that are 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't look like a true passer," Sherbeck said. "But the thing I like 
about him is that he's very intelligent, a very strong competitor. He just 
makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Two starting guards, Joe Hayes and Matt Nicolo also return. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, linebackers Mahe Liavaa and Keoni Manliguis return to give 
Fullerton a powerful force against the run. 
</P>
<P>
"These are two of the finest players you will find at linebacker in community 
college football," Sherbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Capps and Dante Venturelli, who played but didn't start last season, 
return at the defensive end position. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary, always a Fullerton strong point under coach Al Feola, has four 
sophomores back, including safety Orlando Robbins. Robbins had a team-high six 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The one defensive question for Fullerton is the line, which was depleted by 
graduation. Fullerton has six players ready, including sophomores Mitch Mier 
and Ken Bell, but Sherbeck says they all lack "important game experience."

As the U.S. Open tennis tournament approaches its climax, former Swedish star 
Bjorn Borg was drawing a different kind of crowd in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
His five-minute wedding ceremony with Italian pop singer Loredana Berte at the 
city hall was preceded by a brawl between the couple's private security guards 
and reporters and photographers who were barred from the ceremony. An Italian 
weekly magazine was given exclusive rights to the story.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, who open their season at home against the Cleveland 
Browns Sunday, haven't even been able to get around the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
The Stones' first Pittsburgh concert in 17 years Wednesday night means the 
Steelers won't be able to practice in Three Rivers Stadium until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a distraction and a hardship from our normal practice routine," said Joe 
Gordon, the team's business manager. "This is the first time since Three Rivers 
opened (in 1970) that I can remember this happening the week of the home 
opener." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Steelers will practice on their nearby grass practice field, 
which they normally use only when they play teams with natural turf fields.

RULING THE ROOST; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS STARTED ON A WING AND A PRAYER NOW FEATHERS HIS NEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Owners of pet birds no longer need to feel guilty about keeping their feathered 
friends in cramped quarters. All it takes is $4,000 or so to give the creatures 
room to spread their wings and a leisurely life of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Jim Durant, some birds have been flying their old crowded coops into 
roomier, better-appointed cages -- up to 40 feet tall -- made of solid brass 
and copper, some trimmed with marble and beveled glass. 
</P>
<P>
His Santa Ana-based firm, James Durant Aviaries, is a leading maker of 
world-class bird cages. Among the avian cognoscenti, Durant is to bird cages 
what Godiva is to chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
The cages are sold to such customers as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt 
Regency Macau in Hong Kong and just plain folks. Well, maybe not so plain -- 
Durant could be called cage-maker to the stars. His customer list includes a 
rock star or two, an oil mogul in Kuwait, and actors Chevy Chase and Patrick 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of a cramped shop piled high with half-built bird cages, feeders 
and brass pedestals, Durant controls the business from concept to delivery. 
With the help of two assistants -- sometimes more, depending on his backlog -- 
Durant takes from 30 hours to several months to produce any of his 13 standard 
models or to custom-design something even more spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has made cages as small as 10 by 12 inches, Durant is best known 
for his large creations, such as the cage he designed for the Hyatt Regency in 
Chicago. The 40-foot-tall cage measures 17 feet in diameter and will cost in 
the low six figures. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to deluxe cages, size is not the only reason that Durant 
rules the roost. Creature comforts include solid brass ladders or swings, 
hand-formed feed cups and cast legs on the brass and copper bases. 
</P>
<P>
Even with price tags that match what some people pay for a car, Durant's 
customers keep flocking to his establishment. He estimated that he sells 100 to 
150 cages a year for an average price of $3,200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
A diminutive eccentric who wears a queue, Durant is nonchalant about why his 
business has taken off. "A lot of times, people just want something special," 
he said. "Some people hunger for quality in everyday products." 
</P>
<P>
Customers with that appetite are like Gloria Allen, a San Francisco-area bird 
breeder, who has five Durant cages. Her assortment includes a model that's 
Durant's piece de resistance -- an eight-foot-tall, seven-foot-wide custom cage 
with a beveled glass top and drawers of jade marble that match the marble in 
Allen's fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
After plunking down roughly $14,000 for the cage, Allen said Durant's prices 
are "absolutely awful. But if you're a person who cares to attire your home 
with only the best, what you want is a Jim Durant cage. He has no imitators -- 
there is no finer-quality cage." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, when Durant started building cages, he had no idea that 
anyone but him gave a hoot about what their pet cages looked like. A civil 
engineer, Durant indirectly got into the cage business in 1970 when a friend 
gave him a parrot. When he could not find a cage he liked, he began building 
one himself. 
</P>
<P>
Durant spent about a year welding together brass and copper before he finished 
the six-foot-tall cage. "I wanted it to be perfect," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He showed his creation to the local pet store, which asked him to make two for 
them to use in the shop. Within two weeks, the cages flew out the door -- one 
for $250 and a considerably larger one for $500. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Durant's business advisers told him the idea of a bird cage business 
was, well, for the birds. What they had not figured was that some veterinarians 
and avian authorities estimate that there may be up to 200 million pet birds 
nationally -- nearly double the combined number of cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
By 1974, Durant had started his business on a wing and a prayer. But within a 
few years, the business really took off, after a friend persuaded Durant to run 
an ad in Architectural Digest. 
</P>
<P>
The exposure gave Durant instant access to high-income shoppers and interior 
designers, who thought his product was just the thing to show off such rare 
birds as macaws and cockateels. 
</P>
<P>
The uniqueness of Durant's merchandise is the sort of thing that can make you 
want to buy a bird. In fact, that's exactly what Patrick Duffy, the "Dallas" 
star did. A while back, when Duffy ordered his cage from a catalogue, he did 
not realize that the cage -- intended for his small bird -- was actually 
designed to fit a giant parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"He ended up leaving his little bird in the same cage," Durant said, "and went 
out and bought a parrot to go in mine."

<TEXT>
<P>
In the private and mysterious world of high-powered jewelry dealing, Arthur 
Groom stands out like a diamond in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
Groom, 39, whose firm sold $12 million worth of diamonds and other gems last 
year, frequently travels to jungles, cavernous mines and other remote spots in 
Asia and Africa in a constant search for the world's rarest rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Like the sailing merchants of centuries past, Groom will barter and trade for 
many of his stones. He recently swapped a shipload of cement for $1 million 
worth of diamond "roughs" from the African nation of Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
Groom seeks stones in dangerous, strife-ridden nations, such as Myanmar 
(formerly called Burma), where he says he is only the third American since 1962 
to gain the rights to deal in rubies. Most recently, Groom closed a deal to 
become the sole distributor of American soft drinks in that Southeast Asian 
nation. He plans to repatriate the profits in gems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Indiana Jones 
</P>
<P>
And while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions cloaked in secrecy, 
Groom, who is outspoken and friendly, seeks the spotlight. He employs a 
publicist who pitches Groom as a modern-day Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been very few dealers who are so public," said Abe Michael 
Shainberg, executive director of New York's exclusive Diamond Dealers Club, 
considered the world's most important diamond exchange. "The average diamond 
dealer, for security reasons, does not want such publicity." 
</P>
<P>
He described Groom as "an honest and honorable man. His publicity is good for 
his business, and good for the rest of us, too." 
</P>
<P>
Seated in a small office at his fashionable store in the New York suburb of 
Ridgewood, Groom proudly showed off stones with $100,000 price tags. The 
shirt-sleeved man, who wore no jewelry, smiled and insisted he is "not Indiana 
Jones." 
</P>
<P>
"No intrigue," he said. "But I do have a message." 
</P>
<P>
Groom says American business can exert a positive influence throughout the 
world. He is convinced that the world respects the American system but that 
Americans must also understand and respect other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cultures, the American way does not hold up," he said. "How dare we 
have that attitude that ours is the only way." 
</P>
<P>
Groom's story, however, is the stuff of the American dream. He left a 
successful job as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 15 years ago after 
a friend's father urged him to take a gem course that left him "absolutely 
fascinated" with precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Flier 
</P>
<P>
Groom said he struggled at first, working 15-hour days in a one-room enterprise 
as his friends climbed their respective corporate ladders. Arthur Groom &amp; 
Co. in Ridgewood and his American Trading Co. in New York slowly grew into a 
multimillion-dollar-a-year business with offices around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some dealers who only work the phones, Groom goes directly to faraway 
mines to pick out his own stones and diamond roughs. One of the few dealers who 
sells both diamonds and other gems, Groom is the consummate frequent flier, 
logging more than 150,000 miles each year. 
</P>
<P>
Groom said he draws energy from his work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a science to picking stones in the jungle," he said. "Then you go to 
the Diamond Dealers Club and pull up your shirt sleeves and wheel and deal. 
Some Saturdays, I'll simply work the floor of this store, helping an old lady 
who needs a $10 soldering job on a broken chain." 
</P>
<P>
His ruby deal with Myanmarbrought Groom face-to-face with military leaders of a 
nation that was virtually shut off to American businessmen since its 1962 coup. 
The Myanmar rubies, Groom said, are the rarest and most desirable stones in the 
world, retailing for about $10,000 a carat. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if dealing with Myanmar's harsh government tugged at his conscience, 
Groom nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll be putting 1,200 people to work in the soft-drink bottling plant. I 
really believe we should be there to have a presence." 
</P>
<P>
Groom said he was moved by the poverty in many African nations. He said he 
believes that trading cement, food and clothing for gems will make a difference 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to pay cash," Groom said. "But what good does it do for those 
countries? Who gets the money? These people need so much."

SANTANA: SOME COOL MUSIC FOR A WARM NIGHT IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlos Santana and his band gave several thousand fans an intoxicating send-off 
to summer at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa Sunday. The warm night and 
the outdoor stage were the perfect setting for Santana's patented synthesis of 
Latin, African and rock rhythms coupled with distinct jazz and blues 
sensibilities. The Woodstock veteran didn't offer any surprises, but then his 
vocal fans weren't asking for any; they were on their feet much of the night, 
swaying to the propulsive beat. 
</P>
<P>
Instrumentals, which made up the lion's share of the 2 1/2-hour program, ranged 
from introspective pieces to breakneck percussive workouts, all cut through 
with Santana's distinctively soaring guitar. At worst, the instrumental jams 
percolated along amiably if somewhat aimlessly; at best, as happened several 
times in the show, the band locked into a monster groove -- though two elegant 
keyboard-and-guitar duets, "Blues for Salvador" and the plaintive "Goodness and 
Mercy," were highlights as well. 
</P>
<P>
Still, vocal numbers drew some of the biggest responses, most notably a pairing 
of classic-rock staples from the "Abraxas" album, "Black Magic Woman/Gypsy 
Queen" and "Oye Como Va", launched with a fiery duel between bassist Keith 
Jones and drummer Wilfredo Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
The tight and responsive band (Santana lineup number thirtysomething) was 
rounded out by longtime members Chester Thompson on keyboards, conga player 
Armando Peraza and singer Alex Ligertwood. 
</P>
<P>
Santana himself cut a familiar figure as he frequently closed his eyes and 
gently nodded his head to the music. The lanky guitarist spoke rarely and, 
during solos, often faced his band instead of the audience, but he nevertheless 
managed to project a warm and easygoing image on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, at 42, he seems to have lost none of his musical prowess. While 
lengthy instrumental jams generally have fallen from favor, Santana's 
continuing popularity might be ascribed to his light touch. Others have given 
in to bombast and pointless soloing, but Santana usually keeps his music moving 
forward, and eminently danceable. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's set began to lose some of its focus toward the close, however, as 
other band members took turns soloing. But a lengthy encore that ended with an 
extended "Deeper, Dig Deeper" from 1987's "Freedom" album brought back some of 
the punch. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the set might have been trimmed back a bit, the holiday weekend 
crowd (about two-thirds of the amphitheater's capacity) seemed in no hurry to 
leave. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a summer night.

WHY WOMEN LOSE OUT IN DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patricia White has never regretted her decision to divorce her husband of six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
What she has regretted, though, was how she went about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed the house over to him, the car, and basically left the marriage with 
what I came in with," said White, a 32-year-old graphic artist who asked that 
her real name not be used. "He said he'd fight me for custody of our son if I 
didn't, and I guess I just let him intimidate me one more time. 
</P>
<P>
"His mortgage is less than what I pay now in rent for a tiny apartment, and 
he's doing great. For me it's a constant struggle," she said. "It was stupid of 
me, I know that now, but it's a little late to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
White's story is by no means an isolated one. Despite the passage of no-fault 
and equitable-distribution divorce laws over the last two decades, many women 
end up faring significantly worse than their husbands after a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living Standard Declines 
</P>
<P>
In a Harvard University study, sociologist Lenore Weitzman found that, on an 
average, women with minor children experience a 73% decline in their standard 
of living during the first year after divorce, while their ex-husbands 
experience a 42% increase in their standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
What hasn't been addressed until recently, however, are the reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chris Archambault, director of Divorce Anonymous in Los Angeles, a 
self-help group based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, women are easily 
pressured and intimidated into signing things, and regret it later: "I see it 
all the time. Women can take personal-growth seminars and learn how to develop 
intimacy, but no one is teaching them how to break up intelligently." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, several companies have sought to assist women through the 
financial maze of divorce with such things as audiocassettes and computer 
programs. One computer program called "Divorce Plan," for example, was designed 
for use by attorneys and their clients in projecting the financial impact of 
various settlements. Some women, however, have said that these products ignore 
the emotional factors that led to poor financial decisions in the first place. 
For women facing divorce, two recently published books may help. 
</P>
<P>
"You're Entitled! A Divorce Lawyer Talks to Women" (Contemporary Books: $18.95) 
and "Getting Your Share: A Woman's Guide to Successful Divorce Strategies" 
(Crown: $17.95) address everything from choosing the right attorney, getting an 
accurate picture of family assets and obtaining alimony and child support, to 
common psychological pitfalls that can cost women dearly. 
</P>
<P>
"The major difference between men and women during a divorce is that women get 
wrapped up in the emotional aspects of the breakup and men view it as a 
business deal," said "You're Entitled!" author Sidney DeAngelis, a New York 
divorce attorney since 1955. "Women come into my office and cry. Men walk in 
and say, 'OK, how much is this going to cost me?' The purpose of the book was 
to get women to look at it the same way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inaction Is Damaging 
</P>
<P>
One of the most damaging courses of action for many women in the early stages 
of divorce, DeAngelis says, is actually one of no action. Instead of promptly 
gathering financial information, such as canceled checks, tax returns, deeds, 
mortgage statements, charge account slips, pension plan information and other 
papers showing financial worth, many women freeze in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe how often I hear, 'But he'd kill me if he found out I 
went through those records,' or, 'We're still living together. What if we get 
back together?' " DeAngelis said. "What they don't realize is that while they 
are crying about the marriage ending, he's out there trying to make it look to 
any judge that he's as poor as can be. 
</P>
<P>
"He's paying a so-called debt to his brother, or selling off part of his 
business to a cousin. If she acts quickly, though, her lawyer will ask the 
court to freeze all the assets so they can't be hidden or dissipated." 
</P>
<P>
Although many women may be tempted to believe their husbands' claims of full 
financial disclosure, DeAngelis calls it risky business. "If you believe him 
when he says, 'Come on, honey, you know I want you and the kids to be happy. 
Just trust me, and let's settle this without the expense of lawyers,' you're a 
goner," he said. "The bottom line is: If he were so wonderful and trustworthy, 
you'd still be married to him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Legal Consultation 
</P>
<P>
"Getting Your Share" co-authors, Lois Brenner, head of the family law 
department of a leading New York City law firm, and Robert Stein, the former 
editor-in-chief of Redbook and McCall's, give similar advice. Brenner recalled 
one woman in her late 40s who showed up for her first legal consultation with 
obvious qualms. "My husband," the woman told Brenner, "has always taken good 
care of me." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the conversation, Brenner learned just how well he had 
taken care of her. After she signed what appeared to be a reasonable separation 
agreement, the amount of the husband's checks became irregular and her 
reimbursement from medical costs was a fraction of what she had actually paid. 
When the man filed for divorce a short time later, the woman was left with the 
bare-bones terms of their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Over and over again, matrimonial lawyers find themselves representing wives 
who have been physically or emotionally abused, sexually betrayed and cheated 
-- and who nonetheless continually accept their husbands' assurances that they 
will 'take care of them,' " the authors say. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce Anonymous director Archambault calls the ill-founded trust a form of 
denial: "By not confronting economic issues, they're thinking, in the back of 
their minds, that maybe it will go away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsure of Assets 
</P>
<P>
There are some indications, though, that failure to pursue economic issues may 
be fueled in large part by ignorance. In one recent national survey of divorce 
lawyers, 52% of respondents said that most of their women clients had an 
unclear picture of family assets or income. 
</P>
<P>
Without accurate information, attorneys say they are flying blind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to know what you're entitled to in a divorce if you have no 
idea what's there to begin with. And a lot of times, the husband doesn't want 
that to be found out," said Ronald Anteau, a family-law specialist with the Los 
Angeles law firm of Simke, Chodos, Silberfeld &amp; Anto. "One client's husband 
went to Las Vegas and converted thousands of dollars into $100 and $500 casino 
chips. You'd be amazed how much money can be kept in a shoe box that way." 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Kaplan, a forensic accountant in Los Angeles who has 
worked on more than 400 divorce cases, underreporting of income by the owners 
of small businesses routinely deprives wives of 20% to 50% of their rightful 
share of property and support. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional accountants who often take information in financial ledgers 
at face value and then try to make sense of the numbers, forensic accountants 
analyze figures and scrutinize them for inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underreported Income 
</P>
<P>
"If the husband is underreporting income," said Kaplan, a partner with the Los 
Angeles accounting firm of Duitch &amp; Franklin, "the wife's share of the 
community property will be substantially reduced and her support payments from 
the husband will be lower than they should be." 
</P>
<P>
Only a careful examination by a wife's attorney or accountant of bank 
statements, paid bills, ledgers and other documents will provide a true picture 
of the business's actual worth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But in all too many divorces," Kaplan said, "the wife fails to press for such 
documents."

WORRIED SICK OVER ILL KIDS; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL DAY-CARE CENTERS GIVE PARENTS AN UNDERUSED OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With schools opening in Los Angeles and throughout California next week, it's 
time for the fall migration -- the migration of the common cold from home to 
classroom and back. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the time when working parents begin worrying about finding care for 
their kids who are too sick to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
This dilemma of the virus season results in employee absenteeism and turmoil in 
the family, yet the idea of day-care centers for children who have minor 
childhood illnesses is moving slowly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Even where sick-child centers do exist, they aren't always successful. Two in 
downtown Los Angeles closed last year for lack of usage, apparently because 
parents preferred to stay home with their sick children, the operators say. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 70 centers have emerged nationwide over the last eight years, with 
about 700 slots to fill a need that is estimated at 350,000 children daily, 
according to the National Assn. for Sick Child Day Care. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 19 million children in the United States younger than 14 
whose parents work full time outside the home and who have no one at home 
during the day, according to a 1986 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Coping 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, most families are coping by having the parent stay at home with the 
sick child," said Carla Rayacich, president of a company that is opening a new 
center for sick children in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale this 
week. Rayacich said research by the sick child day-care association estimates 
the annual cost to U.S. business of these absences at $7 billion to $10 
billion, even larger than the cost to employers of illnesses of the workers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who have to be at work may take their sick children to school or 
regular day care anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"People load the kid up with Tylenol and drop them off, and then they know 
they'll get at least three hours at work before the day-care center calls," 
Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamar Schoessow, a school nurse at John Muir and Will Rogers elementary schools 
in Santa Monica, said she sends home about six children a day during the peak 
of the viral season. 
</P>
<P>
Because a child with a common cold is most contagious just before getting 
symptoms, there is no requirement to keep him home if he doesn't have a fever, 
according to California health guidelines for schools. But the misery index 
often brings these children to the nurse's office to lie down and get a little 
TLC, Schoessow said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has increased particularly in the last two years, she said, since 
her district began accepting students who live outside its boundaries but whose 
parents work in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring their kids sick because the parents work in Santa Monica and come 
from so far, and have no one close by," Schoessow said. "I sometimes keep these 
kids in school the whole day sick -- really sick. Then they come back (to 
school) too soon because the parents have to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that, because these people who have these jobs are people who 
have worked hard to get where they are. And they need to have a steady job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juggling Responsibilities 
</P>
<P>
This juggling of work and child-rearing places enormous strain on parents and 
children, Rayacich said, using the poignant story of a 5-year-old to 
illustrate. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting a center for sick children, Rayacich said, she asked the boy how 
he liked the center and how it compared to having his mother take time off work 
to care for him at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it (the center) fine," the boy told her. "It's more fun. I'm not as 
lonely and Mommy doesn't cry." 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Senter, president of National Pediatric Support Services, an Irvine 
company that operates Rainbow Retreat sick-child units in Pasadena, Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach, said she believes parents are just beginning to 
consider such facilities as an option. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a learning curve," Senter said. "In every needs assessment that we do for 
corporations, sick-child care is coming back number one. People can't miss any 
more days of work. And we're seeing children enter group care at a younger age, 
so they're getting sick more frequently." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 15-bed center sponsored by Transamerica Life Cos. at the California 
Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles closed in June, 1988, after two years 
because it was never more than one-third occupied, said Sandy Comrie, vice 
president for human resources for the company. 
</P>
<P>
A two-bed unit at the California Pediatric and Family Medical Center, a 
downtown clinic, saw almost no usage so it closed in April, 1988, after eight 
months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems generally result from not getting the word out to parents, from 
not answering their questions about the concept and from setting up barriers to 
usage, Senter and Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Questions 
</P>
<P>
The most common parental questions, according to Rayacich: 
</P>
<P>
* How do the centers prevent the spread of disease from child to child? (Toys 
are kept separate, and each child has his own bed with clean linens. Children 
with diseases such as chicken pox are isolated, though some centers won't take 
chicken pox cases.) 
</P>
<P>
* What are the procedures for bringing the child in? (Usually, a phone call at 
least an hour ahead of time to reserve space is required.) 
</P>
<P>
* Should registration forms be filled out ahead of time? (It saves time to do 
this, and also gives a chance for parent and child to tour the center.) 
</P>
<P>
* Does the child need to go to the doctor first? (Some hospital-based centers 
have pediatricians who examine all the children, either for the same fee as an 
office visit or sometimes free. They also will do throat cultures or other 
routine tests. Requiring parents to take the child to the doctor first takes so 
much time that parents tend not to use the sick-child center, Rayacich said.) 
</P>
<P>
* How much does it cost? (Senter's facilities charge $5 a hour to the public, 
$3.50 an hour for corporate-sponsored clients or regular day-care students. 
Torrance Memorial Hospital and Northridge Hospital Medical Center charge $3 and 
$3.25 an hour, respectively. Rayacich's new center in Sunnyvale, called Feeling 
Better Health Day Care, will charge $39 a day.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of the centers are attached to hospital pediatric units and help the 
hospitals build good will as well as fill space. Senter said she believes 
hospitals aren't the best environment for children who are only moderately ill, 
but hospitals can keep down the cost of care by piggybacking the sick-child 
units on existing facilities. Day-care centers can't do that, so they find 
sick-child units too costly, she said.

Rayacich's Feeling Better center is expanding the sick-child center concept 
outside of hospital and day-care center, into a free-standing facility just for 
ill children. With 42 beds, it is four times the size of the average unit 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model for Other Centers 
</P>
<P>
Funded by a group of socially conscious investors, she said, Feeling Better is 
intended as a model for establishment of similar centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Given the right promotion, a hospital's sick-child unit becomes an essential 
part of the community, said Betty Nosbisch, director of pediatrics at Covenant 
Medical Center in Waterloo, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The five-bed Sick Bay child center at Covenant will be five years old this 
fall, Nosbisch said, and "a lot of families have come to depend on us." 
</P>
<P>
One of these parents is Susie Schwieger, assistant director of placement at the 
University of Northern Iowa. Her daughter Anne, 6, and son Matthew, 4, have 
been going to Sick Bay for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Her own traditional upbringing made taking the children there for the first 
time difficult, Schwieger said. "I asked myself, 'Am I abandoning my children 
when they're ill?' " she said. "I grew up in a really traditional home where my 
mom didn't work outside the home. So when we were sick she was there constantly 
at our bedside." 
</P>
<P>
But when the children obviously enjoyed the experience, Schwieger's fears -- 
and guilt -- vanished.

HIGH-HEEL SHOES -- CHIC AND DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High heels look chic, but they're especially rough on the balls of the feet, a 
new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The real killers are shoes with 3-inch heels, according to Rebecca Snow, a 
research assistant at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs who 
conducted the heel study as a master's degree student at UC Davis. She 
evaluated 45 women walking in 3-inch and lower heels. Compared with going 
barefoot, the highest heels increased pressure on the ball of the foot 76%. 
Two-inch heels increased the pressure 53% and one-inch heels increased the 
pressure 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Kase, a Burbank podiatrist and past president of the Los Angeles 
County Podiatric Medical Society, has little good to say about high heels. 
"They increase the risk of stress fractures, calluses, hammertoes, Achilles' 
tendon problems and ankle sprains." 
</P>
<P>
But he's warned countless women who still refuse to part with their daring 
pumps. To these high-heel diehards, he says: "After you get home, kick off your 
high heels and stretch your hamstrings (back-of-the-thigh muscles) and 
Achilles' tendon (connecting the back of the heel to the calf muscles). Then 
wear running shoes the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
When buying high-heel shoes, Kase recommends taking along a ruler. "Women often 
underestimate heel heights," he says. If that's embarrassing, Kase suggests, 
use your thumb: from the tip to the knuckle is about an inch: "Keep heel 
heights to two knuckles high or less." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Fitness 
</P>
<P>
Strength-training exercises don't just improve physique. Increasing upper-body 
strength, say physical therapists, might help ward off "computeritis" -- the 
repetitive strain injuries associated with computer use. The premise is simple. 
Building upper-body strength -- even with simple desk exercises -- can improve 
posture, which in turn can minimize or prevent problems encountered by chronic 
typists, says Betsy Fleisher Terry, a West Los Angeles physical therapist who 
often cares for computeritis victims. 
</P>
<P>
Terry and Laure James, a physical therapist at Valley Hospital in Van Nuys, 
suggest several exercises you can do without leaving your chair. 
</P>
<P>
Shoulder Blade Pinch: While sitting, squeeze the shoulder blades together. Hold 
for the count of five. Relax. Benefit: Reduces the stress that builds up in the 
shoulder blade muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Wrist extensions: Place the wrist on the arm of a chair. Relax the fingers 
downward. Bring the wrist up perpendicular to the arm. Begin with 10 
repetitions. Increase to 30. Benefit: Strengthens the muscles on the back of 
the forearm, which help stabilize the wrist while typing. 
</P>
<P>
Chair raise: Put your hands, fingers pointing outwards, on the arm of a chair. 
Raise yourself up and down. Begin with 10 repetitions; increase to 20 or 30. 
Benefit: Strengthens the muscles which help extend the elbow and the arm.

ADVICE TO WOMEN ON GETTING FAIR SHARE FROM THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both "You're Entitled!" and "Getting Your Share" authors lay bare common 
mistakes women make, many of them rooted in emotional factors: 
</P>
<P>
* Phone calls made angrily to a husband's family, friends or co-workers may 
provide him with information that can be used against her later. 
</P>
<P>
* Talking about finances with a husband during divorce proceedings, or agreeing 
to "think about" any offer he makes, increases a woman's vulnerability, says 
Sidney DeAngelis. Men think they have driven a wedge between their wife and her 
lawyer, he says, and assume they can ignore genuine negotiation attempts. 
</P>
<P>
* Listening to threats that he will bankrupt the business and leave her with 
nothing if she doesn't sign a settlement offer can kill a woman's chances of an 
equitable agreement forever. 
</P>
<P>
* Dating him during litigation is dangerous, say Lois Brenner and Robert Stein, 
since it often leads to the weakening of the woman's confidence and resolve. 
</P>
<P>
* In both books, women are repeatedly cautioned to hold their emotional cards 
out of view and are reminded of the likely consequences if they don't. The man 
they are divorcing is no longer a friend, the authors stress, and must be 
viewed as a business deal gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
A business deal, they add, that has the potential of affecting their lives 
negatively for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Women who read the books shouldn't be too quick to assume that, with the new 
tactical information they have been given, they are automatically going to get 
their financial due. DeAngelis said that he currently is at work on another 
book, this one directed toward men.

DIRECTOR ALLISON LIDDI ON HER WAY TO 'CLOUD NINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allison R. Liddi was working as an agent's assistant when the TV and film 
writers went on strike last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly we were on half-time, there was no money, everybody was going crazy, 
selling flowers on the street," she recalled. "Then a woman I'd met at a UCLA 
Extension class said she wanted to produce a play -- and wanted me to direct." 
</P>
<P>
The project, a revival of Eve Merriam's "The Club," opened at West Coast 
Ensemble; Times critic Ray Loynd dubbed it "sublime." Said Liddi: "It reminded 
me that this is what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Liddi has directed one of the most acclaimed productions of the 
season: Caryl Churchill's "Cloud Nine," also at West Coast Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
After the success of "The Club," Liddi (who has bachelor's and master's degrees 
in directing from UC Irvine) quit her job and started pursuing the directing 
full-time. Earlier, she had spent six months assisting Allan Miller at the Back 
Alley. Now she worked for director John Nicolella on a movie for cable: For her 
public relations services, she was allowed to observe his work on the set. 
"Believe me, I've done worse," Liddi, 30, said wryly. "One director -- no, not 
Allan -- made me walk his dog." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the ignominious nature of breaking into directing. But in the last few 
months, Liddi has compiled a healthy trio of credits: "The Musical Comedy 
Murders of 1940" (just closed at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in 
Fullerton), the recent musical "Roleplay" at Group Rep, and now "Cloud Nine." 
</P>
<P>
"Churchill is so seductive," she said of the play's author, who busies her 
seven actors in a merry-go-round of character quick-changes, juxtaposing a 
rowdy farce in 1889 Africa with a modern-day tale set in London. The story of 
Clive and Betty (the latter played by a man in Act I, a woman in Act II), their 
offspring and various lovers is both arch and tender, rambunctious and elegant; 
it is not for the theatrically or sexually squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
Although Liddi had seen the play three times before, Don Amendolia's 
well-received 1983 production at the L.A. Stage Company West remains a blur. 
"It was a proscenium theater and I think we were in the cheap seats," she said 
vaguely. "It was just so far away; I didn't feel like anybody got inside me." 
</P>
<P>
Proximity is hardly a factor in her staging at West Coast, where the stage is 
flanked on each side by audience seats -- and stairs leading to additional 
playing space on two balconies. Liddi's original blocking had to be scrapped 
two weeks before opening when she discovered the sightlines were faulty. A new 
plan was devised, every sight-line corrected, all the blocking redone. The cast 
tried gamely to adjust. "They kept saying, 'Where's the lake now?' " 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Liddi hopes to move "Cloud Nine" and "Roleplay" to a mid-size house 
and run them in repertory. (Both shows have had to accommodate their runs to 
the set production schedules in company-run houses.) She also hopes to start 
moving into film work. Last year, Liddi observed Lee Shallat (who had spoken 
with her master's class at UCI) directing a few episodes of the Fox TV series 
"Duet." 
</P>
<P>
Liddi (born on Catalina, reared in Long Beach) came to directing via acting. 
</P>
<P>
"We all try to act," she said cheerfully, "but it never happened for me. I 
never felt whatever that rush is that actors must feel. I think that one of the 
reasons I'm so good around actors is because I never say to myself, 'I could do 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for her agency detour, Liddi offers no apologies: "I never doubted that I 
wanted to direct. I think I just forgot it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
With "Cloud Nine," she and seven other UCI grads formed Singular Productions; 
four of them are in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in working with people you know is you get trust -- 
immediately," Liddi said bluntly. "The most challenging, difficult part of 
rehearsal is not the last couple of weeks before you open. It's when you first 
sit down with people and say, 'Welcome to the first rehearsal. This is how I 
feel about the play.' And they're thinking, 'Who is she? Can I trust her? What 
has she done, anyway?' 
</P>
<P>
"Having a strong sense of yourself isn't easy when you're young," she shrugged. 
"Sometimes I'm like Clive: I want to dominate and take control of everything, 
everybody. Sometimes I'm like Betty: 'Please like me.' That's what's so great 
about theater -- it brings up these feelings about ourselves. It's like Betty 
at the end; the only thing you can do is embrace her. It's part of who you are. 
Inexperience is part of who I was. But now I'm getting better and better and 
better." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed out loud. "Five years from now we'll talk again and I'll be so 
cool. . . ."

Two San Fernando Valley women who were lost in the San Gabriel Mountains 
overnight after being separated from other hikers were found this morning by a 
team of searchers, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Taylor of Studio City and Joell Hansen of La Crescenta, both 22, were in 
good condition despite the cold, Deputy Roger Hom said. They had been separated 
from two other hikers about 4:30 p.m. Monday near Devil's Canyon Trail, north 
of Monrovia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were wearing tank tops and shorts and were obviously not prepared to stay 
overnight up there," Hom said. "They were tired, cold and hungry." 
</P>
<P>
The women were found about 6 a.m. by five members of the Sheriff's Department 
Montrose search and rescue team, Hom said. The search had begun at 7:30 p.m. 
when the two other hikers, whose identities were unavailable, reported the 
women missing. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Hansen were flown by helicopter to the Chileo campground, where they 
were examined by paramedics and released, Hom said.

'BIZARRE' WOMAN DIES IN CUSTODY

A woman who struggled with police while being taken into custody for a mental 
evaluation collapsed at the Van Nuys Jail and later died at a hospital, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old woman's name and hometown were not released pending 
notification of relatives, Detective Ron Karlson said. Los Angeles police 
subdued the woman after being summoned to the 12700 block of Mercer Street in 
Pacoima at 2:30 p.m. Monday, Karlson said. Officers were called by paramedics 
who had responded to a report of a woman acting "bizarre" and falling on the 
street, Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Four officers restrained the struggling woman and handcuffed her as she was 
taken into custody for a mental evaluation, Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken first by ambulance to Olive View Medical Center for psychiatric 
evaluation, but before she was admitted police determined that she had several 
outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrants and she was then taken to the jail. 
While being booked, the woman collapsed and stopped breathing, Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
The jail doctor attempted to revive her and paramedics took her to Valley 
Hospital Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead at 4:27 p.m., Karlson 
said. The cause of death was unknown.

U.S. REJECTS ISRAELI PLEA FOR REFUGEE CAMP AID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and other nations rejected an Israeli request for aid to 
rehabilitate Palestinian refugee camps because of lack of progress on peace 
efforts, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter this week to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, President Bush turned 
down an Israeli request for aid to rehabilitate refugee camps in the occupied 
territories, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, Japan, Canada and European nations all rejected the 
request and said any additional refugee assistance depends on further progress 
in stalemated peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's letter came in response to Shamir's request about two months ago for the 
United States to take a leading role in aiding rehabilitation of the camps, 
Ahimeir said. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the refugee problem to be a very important human problem," Ahimeir 
said on Israel radio. "Resolving it could help advance the entire peace 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose as Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Shamir's 
right-wing Likud Party headed to Washington to drum up more American help for 
peace efforts and to argue against PLO chief Yasser Arafat's receiving a U.S. 
visa to address the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for holding up the peace process, saying 
slayings of 107 residents in the territories by fellow Arabs were aimed at 
blocking agreement to Israel's peace initiative. Most of those killed were 
accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli news reports quoted Bush as saying in his letter to Shamir that the 
refugee camps had to be part of a "comprehensive plan to resolve the conflict" 
between Israel and Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also reportedly reminded Shamir that the United States already plays a 
prominent role in aiding the refugees by contributing to the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency.

President Bush is prepared to name James Woolsey Jr., a conservative Democrat 
and weapons specialist, as the new American negotiator in 23-nation talks to 
reduce non-nuclear forces in Europe, a U.S. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Security checks have begun on Woolsey, a lawyer who apparently owes his 
nomination over two other candidates to his close ties to Brent Scowcroft, the 
President's national security adviser, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The two other candidates were Stephen Ledogar, a Foreign Service officer who 
now holds the job, and Phil Karber, vice president of BDM Corp. who evidently 
had the backing of Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Woolsey, 48, was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carter Administration and 
has served on the staffs of the National Security Council and the Senate Armed 
Services Committee.

5 U.S. COPTERS TO FIGHT DRUGS IN COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
BULLETPROOF VESTS ALSO ARRIVE FOR PROTECTION OF JUDGES, PROSECUTORS

Five U.S. UH-1 helicopters and a shipment of bulletproof vests arrived today, 
the third package of U.S. aid sent under President Bush's $65-million emergency 
plan to help Colombia battle cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopters and vests landed in a C-5 cargo plane, the third military 
shipment in three days to be rushed to Colombia since an Aug. 24 declaration of 
"total war" by the powerful cartels against any opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The shipment arrived just hours before Bush was to announce his 
Administration's new anti-drug program, which officials say is to include 
another $300 million to help South American nations stem the production of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vests to Protect Judges 
</P>
<P>
"(The helicopters) will be used by the anti-narcotics police," said a U.S. 
Embassy official. "They can be used to transport material and personnel." 
</P>
<P>
The bulletproof vests are to protect Colombian prosecutors and judges, who have 
been named as targets for assassinations, threats and bribes. Some Colombian 
officials admit that the judicial system has been virtually paralyzed by the 
cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
The latest shipment of U.S. aid came as the wife of a Colombian army colonel 
was shot dead by unidentified attackers in northern Bogota this morning. 
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman said said the army had no clues to the motives of 
the killing but added: "Terrorism in the country is so savage that people are 
being killed simply because they are family members of military personnel." 
</P>
<P>
The woman killed today was the wife of Col. Carlos Guerrero Pena. 
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry spokesman, Col. Eduardo Arevalo, asked whether Guerrero 
Pena had been active in the government's anti-narcotics effort, said he had 
been no more involved than anyone else in Colombia's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
However, the shadowy group called "The Extraditables," named for suspected drug 
traffickers sought by the United States, said in a "declaration of total war" 
against the Colombian government last month that "we will not respect the 
family members of those who have not respected ours." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier shipments of U.S. aid, two four-engine C-130 transport planes landed 
in Bogota on Sunday, and on Monday eight A-37 reconnaissance and attack jets, 
formerly stationed at Air National Guard units in Illinois and Michigan, were 
turned over to Colombia at a military base in the Caribbean city of 
Barranquilla. 
</P>
<P>
"These aircraft, which will be piloted by Colombians, will strengthen our 
combat capacity," Gen. Alfonso Amaya, commander of the Colombian air force, 
said as the A-37s were delivered. The fast-climbing, twin-engine jets can be 
equipped with rockets and machine guns. Colombia already has some A-37s.

OPEC produced about 21.6 million barrels of oil a day last month, up from a 
revised 21.4 million in July and far above the cartel's self-imposed ceiling, 
the International Energy Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
In its Monthly Oil Market Report, the IEA said that most of the excess 
production came from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate, one of the highest this year, exceeds the 19.5 million 
barrels a day that the cartel agreed to produce in the last half of this year 
to keep output under control and prices firm. OPEC had also decided in June on 
a target price of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite promises to keep production in check, OPEC's supply has remained strong 
and prices have slipped since last spring when they reached their highs of the 
year. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC 
registered $16.44 a barrel at the end of August. It topped the $18 mark last 
spring.

U.S. PROMISES JAPAN FAST ACTION ON TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT AMERICAN NEGOTIATORS FAIL TO WIN SIMILAR ASSURANCE FROM TOKYO AT TALKS

<P>
The United States promised Japan today that it will attack its deep-rooted 
economic problems quickly but it failed to win a similar assurance from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of two days of high-level talks, U.S. officials said Washington 
agreed with many of Japan's proposals for cutting their huge trade gap, 
including the need for more U.S. savings. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed with a great deal of the suggestions of our Japanese colleagues," 
Undersecretary of State Richard T. McCormack told reporters. "We would hope 
that they would entertain our . . . proposals with the same seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese ministers sounded less conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral talks like this are not meetings where Japan follows what the United 
States says," Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Economic Planning Minister Sumiko Takahara added: "Washington is more 
responsible for the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance than Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Talks Planned 
</P>
<P>
Washington proposed the talks after countless negotiations on Japanese import 
barriers and big changes in currency rates failed to cut the $50-billion trade 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
This week's talks were the first in a series of discussions planned over the 
next nine months aimed at cutting the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
At today's session, Japan urged the United States to take a number of steps to 
become more competitive -- promote exports, do away with needless government 
regulations, expand manufacturing capacity and improve training. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Washington needs quick results from the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential we have results," Commerce Department 
Undersecretary Michael Farren said. "They (the talks) must have some very 
specific impact on the trade imbalance." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is under increasing pressure from Congress for action 
to cut the big trade gap with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Problems 
</P>
<P>
Domestic politics argue against quick action by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
With the ruling Liberal Democratic Party floundering in the polls and a crucial 
general election due by next summer, this is hardly the best time for the 
Japanese government to advocate radical change, Tokyo officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials tried to get around those political difficulties by portraying 
their demands as good not only for U.S. businessmen but also for Japanese 
consumers. Quick action by Japan would both reduce the country's trade surplus 
and benefit Japanese consumers by giving them greater choice and lower prices, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese people have worked long and hard," McCormack said. "Ordinary 
Japanese consumers should basically have a better shake."

Stung by allegations that concerts sponsored by beer companies encourage minors 
to drink, the nation's biggest brewer said it will donate $250,000 to Students 
Against Driving Drunk in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The money will help provide SADD chapter start-up kits to all Texas junior and 
senior high schools, Stephen J. Burrows, Anheuser-Busch vice president for 
consumer awareness and education, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Co. were criticized for sponsoring large 
outdoor music festivals in seven Texas cities over the Labor Day weekend. Both 
brewers took precautions to prevent underage drinking and the events, which 
drew 500,000 people, were without major problems, police said.

Former Swedish tennis star Bjorn Borg and Italian pop singer Loredana Berte 
exchanged vows in a Protestant church ceremony today, 24 hours after their 
civil wedding at city hall. 
</P>
<P>
A pastor from Berne, Switzerland, celebrated the private Lutheran ceremony in a 
tiny downtown church. Church officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity, 
said about 20 guests attended. They included Borg's parents, his son Robin and 
Adriano Panatta, a former player who captains the Italian Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
As they had been Monday, reporters and photographers were barred from the 
ceremony. An Italian weekly magazine, which had been given exclusive rights to 
the story, employed bodyguards to keep onlookers and reporters outside the iron 
fences of the church.

Yankees trainer Gene Monahan, completing a promise he made just after the 
All-Star break, shaved his head Monday after the team's season-high fifth 
straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have to sacrifice vanity for intensity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Yankees beat the California Angels 2-1, Monahan sat in the trainer's 
room while five players attacked his mop of thick black hair. Jesse Barfield 
started with a pair of scissors, doing "most of the damage," he said. Mel Hall 
finished with a razor. 
</P>
<P>
"He cooperated fully," Barfield said. "He really showed me something." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, a Yankees trainer for 17 years, made his promise during the New 
York-Kansas City series in mid-July. At the time, the Yankees had won as many 
as four straight only once -- in April.
