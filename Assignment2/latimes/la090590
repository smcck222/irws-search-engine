APPEALS COURT FINDS S.D. TAX FOR JAILS LEGAL

<P>
Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax that San Diego County voters narrowly 
approved more than two years ago to build new jails and courts, was ruled legal 
Tuesday by a unanimous appellate court that said it was properly enacted. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing a lower-court ruling, a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court 
of Appeal in San Bernardino ruled that, although the measure barely passed -- 
with 50.6% of the vote -- a majority vote was enough to make it legal. 
</P>
<P>
In a complex ruling, the court said the measure did not need to garner the 
two-thirds approval required for new taxes under either Proposition 13, the 
landmark 1978 tax-cutting initiative, or a 1986 tax initiative, Proposition 62. 
For technical reasons in the tax laws, Proposition 13 simply did not apply and 
neither did the other measure, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling validated a ballot measure that proponents have hailed as the 
financial answer to the county's longstanding problems of jail crowding and a 
badly overextended court system. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling also has statewide implications as other counties have closely 
watched the San Diego case for guidance on meeting criminal justice funding 
needs. In Orange County, for example, supervisors have been considering putting 
a similar sales tax before voters to pay for much-needed new jails, but were 
not certain they could gain a two-thirds approval. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the decision, however, Proposition A -- and the $160 million that 
already has been collected while the case has dragged through the courts -- 
remains in legal limbo pending a further appeal to the California Supreme 
Court, lawyers and county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And an appeal is certain, said Louis Katz, one of the attorneys for leaders of 
the San Diego County Libertarian Party, on whose behalf the suit was brought. 
Katz said he remains convinced that the tax is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel they're wrong," Katz said, referring to the 4th District Court's 
ruling. "We're going to appeal it. We're going to the Supreme Court. We think 
we're eventually going to prevail. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court does not take the case, the money -- precisely 
$160,140,314.84 as of Tuesday, all of it sitting in an interest-bearing account 
-- will be available immediately, said Rich Robinson, director of the county's 
Office of Special Projects, the agency that since 1986 has directed planning 
for local jails and courts. 
</P>
<P>
If the court grants a hearing, however, the money will remain in the account 
while the court considers the case, Robinson said. If it finds that the tax is 
illegal, the tax would be temporarily rolled back to enable San Diego consumers 
to recoup the funds illegally collected under Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said Tuesday that there is no way to predict whether the Supreme Court 
will take the case. Still, San Diego officials were jubilant Tuesday at the 
prospect of finally gaining access to the mountains of money the measure has 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor John McDonald, one of the current members of the agency that 
Proposition A created to spend the revenue, the San Diego County Regional 
Justice Facility Financing Agency, said, "It's probably the best news I've had 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It now gives us the opportunity to move seriously ahead with planning for the 
courts and jails." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Wes Pratt, another member of the financing agency, said the 
ruling means officials "will now be able to move forward and start constructing 
the facilities we need to keep criminals off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there's a great need for additional courts," he added. "The $160 
million will help, but a lot more still needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who is the acting director of the financing agency, said the panel 
already has put together a master plan that calls for the cash to be spent on 
four projects: 
</P>
<P>
* Addition of 754 beds at the county's East Mesa jail near the U.S.-Mexico 
border, 7 miles east of Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
Building for the first 754 beds is under way and is expected to be completed by 
spring, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-strapped county has insufficient funds to operate even the first unit 
when it opens, Robinson said. But, up to 25% of Proposition A funds can be 
spent for operating costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a new central booking facility to replace the aging County 
Jail downtown. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are under court order to reduce the number of inmates at the 
downtown jail, which has been hovering at about 1,000 inmates for most of 1990, 
to 750 by Oct. 29, or face fines and jail sentences themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction at the downtown jail was ordered Aug. 20 by El Cajon Superior 
Court Judge James Malkus after the county reported in July that it had lowered 
inmate populations at five outlying jails. 
</P>
<P>
* Expansion or replacement of the downtown County Courthouse, home to the San 
Diego Superior and Municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
* Expansion of the North County courthouse in Vista, which also holds Superior 
and Municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
If the money was available, Robinson said, progress "could be made very quickly 
on all of them." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming," Robinson said, referring to the 4th District 
court's ruling. "We have remained steadfastly optimistic that we would get a 
fair hearing. I think we got that." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy, who runs the county jails, said he hopes opponents of the 
tax "would have a change of heart" regarding an appeal. He added: "The 
responsible thing to do is for them to say, 'We tried, and we didn't make it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Over its 10-year life, the half-cent sales tax, which raised the local sales 
tax to 7% beginning Jan. 1, 1989, is projected to generate $1.6 billion for new 
jails and courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
By the slim 50.6% margin, voters approved the measure in June 1988. The suit 
challenging the measure was filed the next month. 
</P>
<P>
The case was heard in Riverside County because of San Diego judges' conflict of 
interest in a matter affecting courtroom space. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the county and for the financing agency argued that the 1987 state 
legislation that set the stage for the measure stated that a majority vote was 
sufficient for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Katz -- and the six other attorneys who filed the lawsuit for the Libertarians 
-- contended, however, that the legislation was a sham that violated both the 
letter and spirit of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 1989 decision, Riverside Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart sided 
with opponents of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But the 4th District court said Tuesday that Proposition 13 had no bearing on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 applies only to agencies that can levy taxes, Justice Thomas E. 
Hollenhorst said. The financing agency set up by Proposition A has the power 
only to spend money, not levy taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The financing agency is designed to spend its funds in accord with plans 
developed and approved by county supervisors. So the measure's opponents said 
it is not an independent agency but an alter ego of the county board -- which 
assuredly is subject to the two-thirds provision. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollenhorst said this argument also failed. The proper place to address any 
loopholes like that, he said, is the Legislature, not in a court case. 
</P>
<P>
Katz and the other lawyers also charged that the tax violates Proposition 62, 
an initiative approved in November 1986 that prohibits governmental entities 
from imposing any "special tax" for "special purposes" without a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents claimed that Proposition A was a "special tax," and that funds 
clearly earmarked for courts and jails are for "special purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Hollenhorst, however, said Proposition 62 also did not apply, saying its 
two-thirds requirement is like a referendum on local taxing power. The 
California Constitution, he said, does not permit local governments to hold a 
referendum on local tax measures. 
</P>
<P>
Justices Howard M. Dabney and F. Douglas McDaniel concurred in the opinion.

In "Ron Kovic Calls for Pullout From Gulf" (Aug. 23), The Times reported on a 
counter demonstration led by Los Angeles businessman Robert Zirgulis. 
</P>
<P>
Zirgulis apparently identified himself as being from the International Human 
Rights Watch group. Human Rights Watch dissociates itself from all statements 
of Zirgulis and International Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch is a nonpartisan, nonprofit U.S.-based human rights 
monitoring organization that investigates, documents and publicizes violations 
of human rights throughout the world. Human Rights Watch takes no position on 
the U.S military buildup in Saudi Arabia. Rather it limits its investigations 
and advocacy to human-rights concerns.

FERGUSON ON WORLD WAR II RELOCATION CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we go to the library to study up on the history of World War II and the 
Japanese attack on our country, we'll be sure to go to the fiction section. 
</P>
<P>
How generous our parents, our taxpayers, our citizens are, allowing the 
Japanese to rewrite a vital chapter in American history! Now all we lack is the 
King George version of the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial accuses Ferguson of "an attempt to revise history." It is, in 
fact, a valid attempt to revise the revision. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there was anti-Japanese sentiment in the land -- there was real 
fear. How were we supposed to react? Every country has a right -- and duty -- 
to save itself. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who stands up for traditional American values now better be prepared for 
ridicule and condemnation by the pro-foreign press and too many government 
officials.

RISING GAS PRICES IN MIDEAST CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your Aug. 9 editorial "The Oil Shortage That Need Not Be," we 
would like to state that we in the oil industry realize many motorists are 
angry about rising gasoline prices and that they are wondering whether the 
large oil companies have acted responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to that is yes, even though that may not be widely understood by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
No one can speak for every refiner, every wholesaler or every retailer. In the 
entire nationwide system, there may be some evidence of overreaction to a 
volatile market. But the industry itself has acted and will continue to act 
with restraint and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting multination boycott, 
which is threatening the loss of as much as 4 million barrels a day of oil from 
the world energy marketplace -- the spot market reacted quickly. (The "spot 
market" price is the price for crude oil or gasoline for prompt delivery at a 
specified location and not sold under long-term contract.) 
</P>
<P>
In the first three weeks after the Iraqi invasion, spot prices for crude oil 
rose about 20 cents a gallon and spot gasoline prices about 35 cents a gallon. 
These are the prices oil companies had to pay to replenish their supplies. At 
the same time, retail prices for gasoline that consumers pay rose, on average, 
only about 15 to 16 cents a gallon.

TO DESTROY KUWAIT IN ORDER TO SAVE IT IS THE WORST THING WE COULD DO. INSTEAD,

By CHRISTOPHER BASSFORD, Christopher Bassford, a former U.S. Army artillery

<TEXT>
<P>
If it does become necessary for the United States and allied forces to launch a 
military offensive against Iraq, we must hope that the plans being laid by 
military commanders are more sensible than some of the dubious schemes being 
bandied about in the press. War and politics are inseparable, and it would be 
pointless to win this war in a manner that would doom the following peace. 
</P>
<P>
The first faulty notion is the idea of a "strategic air offensive" against Iraq 
-- wide-ranging bombing that broadly targets Iraqi industry, destroys chemical 
weapons facilities and violently upsets the lives of Baghdad's civilians. Some 
commentators advocate achieving the same ends with more precisely targeted 
commando raids or "surgical air strikes," although such strikes are much more 
often imagined than achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Iraq has only one industry worth mentioning, and that is oil. 
Should we find ourselves in a shooting war, one key purpose of which is to 
ensure the flow of petroleum to the world's economy, it is senseless to destroy 
that industry. As an economic factor in Iraq's defense, it has already been 
shut down by the embargo. As a military factor, the oil fields are irrelevant. 
Their destruction would have no impact on Iraqi military fuel supplies during 
the short -- though undoubtedly bloody -- conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Bombing chemical plants is even less sensible. There would be no effect on 
Iraq's immediately available stocks of chemical munitions, but it would poison 
large areas of land (which we would later have to clean up) and horribly kill 
hundreds or thousands of Iraqi civilians. (That it might kill Western hostages 
as well must not be a factor in our thinking; the responsibility for their 
deaths would be Hussein's.) 
</P>
<P>
Bombing Baghdad is a similarly bad idea. We know from long experience that 
bombing populations merely makes them identify their own fortunes with those of 
the regime under attack. Far more demoralizing would be empty store shelves and 
a steady flow of telegrams announcing the deaths of soldier sons and husbands 
in nameless losing battles in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most absurd idea is that of invading Kuwait and "liberating" it 
without a "provocative" invasion of Iraq itself. It seems that the old concept 
of burning the village in order to save it is still with us. Any pitched battle 
in Kuwait City will leave it a pile of corpse-strewn rubble. This will win us 
few friends among the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The most disturbing thing about this speculation on our military plans is that 
it may not be wrong. In Vietnam, we tried to bomb a country that was hardly out 
of the Bronze Age back to the Stone Age. That policy bore no positive fruit 
because, as with Iraq today, the Vietnamese economy was not the source of the 
enemy's weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the military might that we are pouring into the Persian Gulf with 
such truly impressive speed can still be put to practical offensive use. Saddam 
Hussein's regime does have one vital organ that provides a politically and 
militarily ideal target: the million-strong Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
With one 1 of 17 Iraqis now in uniform, merely supplying the military is a 
crushing burden. It is a conventional, armor-heavy force that must concentrate 
to be effective, thus offering an ideal target for Western air- and 
ground-based firepower. It will be deprived of air support within a few days of 
the outbreak of war. The Iraqi army is, in fact, exactly the kind of target 
American military planners must have dreamed about for years: the Soviet army 
without the Bomb (yet), without air cover, without a massive population and 
industrial base to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
If we are going to wage war, we need to keep our political and economic ends in 
view. We must not destroy the oil industry that is our object to preserve, nor 
alienate the moderate Arab states while destroying a radical one. We cannot 
afford to provide Saddam Hussein with nightly news footage of little Arab girls 
running down the road with their backs on fire -- especially not little Kuwaiti 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the deaths of thousands of Iraqi men in uniform will prove 
entirely acceptable to world opinion. If we beat Hussein's field army in the 
desert, his garrison in Kuwait will wither on the vine. 
</P>
<P>
Our greatest strategic advantage in this struggle is the moral high ground. 
Let's keep it.

LOOKING FOR A WAY AROUND THE TERRITORIAL DISPUTE ; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: SOVIET CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN KURIL ISLANDS HAS KEPT TOKYO AND MOSCOW 
FAR APART SINCE 1945. BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF WARMING THAT SKIRT THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL H. KREISBERG, Paul H. Kreisberg is a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro 
Nakayama have described their three-day meeting in Tokyo this week as a 
potential "turning point" and a "beginning in earnest." 
</P>
<P>
Their agenda is to prepare for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's state 
visit to Japan next April. Japan's first priority is still the "northern 
territories" -- the handful of small islands at the southern end of the Kuril 
chain -- claimed by Japan but occupied by the Soviets since 1945. This is 
virtually the only territory still disputed by World War II combatants. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's official position remains that the islands, within sight of the 
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, must be returned to Japanese sovereignty 
before there can be any real improvement in relations, or a bilateral peace 
treaty formally concluding World War II. But some key leaders of the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party have recently signaled greater flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu acknowledged this summer that it would be "too 
stubborn" for Japan to refuse any significant increase in ties before settling 
the territorial issue. He offered a variety of exchange programs and, 
particularly welcome in Moscow, increased Japanese help with the Chernobyl 
nuclear cleanup. Hard-liners in the finance and foreign ministries continue, 
however, to resist credits for the Soviets until settlement of the territorial 
dispute is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Japan may underestimate the intensity of Soviet, or at least Russian, 
nationalism on such territorial issues. Nikita Khrushchev or Leonid Brezhnev 
would have had the unilateral power to give up the islands, but no agreement 
yielding Soviet territory to Japan will easily pass either the national or 
Russian republic legislatures of today. A Soviet poll earlier this year 
allegedly showed 85% opposition to surrendering the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Republic President Boris Yeltsin proposed late last month putting off a 
resolution for 15 to 20 years. Then, after joint Japanese-Soviet development of 
the islands and their eventual demilitarization, a "new generation" of Soviet 
and Japanese leaders could deal with ultimate sovereignty. This is totally 
unacceptable in Japan. But there may be a basis for discussion in other Soviet 
variations that include shorter time periods and options such as U.N. 
trusteeship, U.S. mediation and major Japanese economic and financial 
assistance to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow knows it must reach an understanding with Asia's most influential state 
if it wants to play a role in the Asian Pacific over the long run. Japan 
realizes it has to deal with Moscow if it wants political and military security 
in northeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
It is striking that both countries for the first time will discuss military and 
security issues, including confidence-building measures and arms control. 
Official Japanese suspicion of Soviet military objectives remains high, but 
parallel Japanese and Soviet policies on Cambodia and the Persian Gulf crisis, 
as well as signs of thinning Soviet forces in the disputed islands (and 
assurances that there are no nuclear weapons there) make discussions easier. 
</P>
<P>
Japan does not want its security policies to get ahead of Washington's, but it 
is beginning to reassess its own positions and interests. Lower tensions 
between Japan and the Soviet Union could diminish Japanese political support 
for U.S. bases (and for Japan's payment of 40% of the cost of the bases), 
reduce consensus on Japan's $30-billion defense budget, and even undermine the 
rationale for the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Most Japanese politicians, other 
than the Socialists, seem convinced that all of this can be managed. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow insists, in the words of a Soviet deputy foreign minister, that improved 
Soviet-Japanese relations will "in no way damage the existing security 
framework between Japan and the United States." This is an important message 
and as close as the Soviets are likely to come to saying that the arrangement 
contributes to stabilizing Japan's role in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position is clear. It will not interfere in the Japanese-Soviet 
negotiating process. Easing of Soviet-Japanese tensions should facilitate 
further reduction of Soviet forces in the region and ultimately contribute to 
similar easing on the Korean peninsula. And the importance of U.S.-Japanese 
relations goes far beyond mutual concern about the "Soviet threat." The 
U.S.-Japan treaty provides for consultation, cooperation and collaboration on 
political, economic and security issues and will continue to be as vital for 
both sides after Soviet-Japanese detente as before.

Iraqi forces in the Persian Gulf. That judgment by U.S. military commanders 
increases the urgency of deciding the wisdom of such a course. It also demands 
that President Bush explain directly to the American people the stakes in the 
crisis, the options, the costs, and what he plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. forces have been moving toward the gulf for only a few weeks, 
American air and sea commanders in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are ready to take 
on Iraq. They are confident of the outcome and are inclined to get it over 
with. Ground force commanders are more cautious about offensive operations at 
this stage of the buildup, but they are already sure of their ability to 
contain an Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of the U.S. buildup has been stunning. Military aircraft litter the 
region's airfields, leading one officer to quip that putting any more on the 
ground would cause Saudi Arabia to sink. Last Saturday, the flagship Blue Ridge 
steamed into the harbor at Manama, Bahrain, and rigged up the complex 
electronics needed to manage a modern war. Airborne troops are deployed forward 
in the desert, masses of supplies are rolling off gangways and aircraft ramps, 
and Marine amphibious units will arrive this week. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military deployments are thus lending credence to the Bush 
Administration's strategy. Iraq's Saddam Hussein must weigh the risks to his 
position at home as well as in Kuwait. And any nation that is halfhearted about 
supporting the economic embargo knows now that there is a riskier alternative: 
open combat. 
</P>
<P>
Regional states, usually inclined to temporize, are facing up to the 
possibility of war. Bahrain's leaders do not believe it can be avoided without 
accepting Iraq's gains. Saudi Arabia is reluctantly willing to envision 
conflict if sanctions come to be seen as having failed, and Egypt believes that 
that time is at most a few months off. No one in the region believes that 
Saddam Hussein will give up easily. 
</P>
<P>
These assessments do not account for the imponderables of war, however. U.S. 
forces may be certain to prevail at sea and in the air, but success on the 
ground would depend on a host of assumptions. These include the ability of air 
power to keep Iraq from reinforcing its tank armies, which vastly outnumber 
opposing ground forces and will do so even after the U.S. buildup is completed. 
While U.S. forces would control the air and any night fighting, Iraq has the 
advantages of mass, proximity, combat experience and adaptation to climate. 
</P>
<P>
Morale is high among U.S. soldiers, but it will be tested by the harsh 
conditions and, perhaps, by uncertainty about what the United States would be 
fighting for. In random conversations, these young Americans express awareness 
that they are not being asked to defend democracy, and for many of them, 
protecting the supply and price of oil is not a compelling argument to start a 
war. A spirit of professionalism counts now, but it may not be enough later on, 
especially if there were no quick victory but rather a punishing battle of 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impressive buildup of American military power, therefore, the 
visitor to this forbidding part of the world is encouraged to explore other 
ways to get Iraq to leave Kuwait -- the indispensable objective. One dimension 
bears particular consideration: the unprecedented coalition that Bush has put 
together to support that limited objective. A U.S.-initiated war would splinter 
the coalition, and with it the President's attempt to exercise U.S. leadership 
through multilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative remains economic sanctions, a policy of waiting out Saddam 
Hussein. But sanctions impose their own difficult challenge: patience. That is 
not an American strength, as reflected in fears that U.S. troops cannot be kept 
in the Arabian desert for very long simply as a deterrent force. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush may already have decided to put aside the alluring, though 
perhaps elusive, vision of a military "quick fix." This is suggested by his 
plan to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev in Helsinki next Sunday. The fact of the 
meeting would make it harder for the United States to start a war because, 
having conferred with Bush, the Soviet president would appear to be in 
collusion with subsequent U.S. actions -- an untenable position. The meeting 
announcement itself has already taken the edge off the U.S. tactic of trying to 
scare Iraq into thinking that war is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is likely to use the summit to draw the diplomatic noose more tightly 
around Saddam Hussein's neck, to reassure Gorbachev that the United States has 
no long-term ambitions in the Persian Gulf that threaten Soviet interests, to 
stress the possibilities of U.S.-Soviet cooperation beyond Europe, and to 
broaden the media's focus. He could even invite Gorbachev to send Soviet forces 
to join the gulf blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The conduct of the summit can thus be the tip-off to Bush's plans. But the 
American people should not have to look for such signals of presidential intent 
on an issue of war and peace. It is the President's duty to present his goals 
and methods clearly to the nation. Otherwise, he could find himself with a 
military buildup that cannot be sustained for long at high levels, domestic 
frustration with the lack of resolution after so much activity, and global 
economic crisis based, in part, on confusion about U.S. intentions.

DOW DIPS 0.99 IN DAY OF VERY LIGHT TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks closed mixed Tuesday in the lightest trading yet this year as investors 
failed to come into the market in appreciable numbers after the three-day 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index lost 0.99 point to close at 2,613.37. It had 
been down as much as 30 points, as oil prices moved sharply higher again. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 8 
to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 673 up, 814 down and 473 unchanged. 
Still, most broad market indexes rose for the day. The NYSE composite index 
added 0.16 points to 177.13. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to a scant 92.94 million shares, the lowest volume of the 
year, down from 96.48 million Friday. Tuesday's volume was the lowest since 
Dec. 26, 1989, when 77.6 million shares changed hands. Traders said many market 
participants apparently extended the Labor Day holiday weekend an additional 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the apparent stalemate in the Middle East crisis and apprehension 
about upcoming U.S. economic data -- especially Friday's scheduled release of 
August unemployment statistics -- kept many investors on the sidelines, 
analysts said. Emerging news seemed to have little impact on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Managers said its index fell slightly in 
August, indicating further weakness in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a decline in oil prices had helped the Dow industrials recover more 
than 80 points. But by Tuesday the failure of United Nations peace efforts and 
the first seizure of an Iraqi ship by the United States under a U.N. blockade 
imposed after the conquest of Kuwait had revived worries over a major 
confrontation in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"What really has people concerned is that this thing could drag on," said Tom 
Callahan, executive vice president at Yamaichi International Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* The Dow's weakness was centered in GM, down 3/4 to 39; GE, down 3/4 to 61 
1/4, and Navistar, off 1/4 to 2 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks were mostly higher. Arco rose 3/4 to 135 5/8, Unocal gained 1/2 to 
32 1/2, and Baker Hughes jumped 1 3/8 to 31 7/8. But Occidental lost 3/8 to 23 
1/4, taking it closer to its 52-week low of 22 1/4. Elsewhere, Texas Petroleum 
rose 7/8 to 23 3/4 following reports that a senior official of Taiwan's 
state-owned Chinese Petroleum is planning a bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
* Pinnacle West Capital plunged 3 3/4 to 12 3/8. Pacificorp terminated its 
attempt to acquire control of Pinnacle in exchange for a power swap with the 
company's Arizona utility unit. 
</P>
<P>
* Adobe Systems soared 3 1/8 to 28 1/8 after the software firm said Apple 
Computer agreed to expand its technology licensing pact for Adobe products. 
</P>
<P>
* Tokos Medical jumped 1 5/8 to 11 5/8. The provider of home health-care 
services for pregnant women completed a merger with a rival firm, and 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities repeated its "buy" recommendation 
on Tokos. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, continued pessimism about the Middle East pushed stocks sharply lower 
for the second day running. Tokyo's key 225-share Nikkei index closed down 
512.79 points or 2.0% at 24,907.64 after falling 577.94 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares also closed lower. The Financial Times 100-share index ended 
off 18.6 points at 2,148.0 in thin volume. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, stocks tumbled more than 2% on low volume on worries about higher 
interest rates. The DAX index of 30 leading shares fell 39.15 points, or 2.4%, 
to close at 1,590.07. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Yield Tops 9% on Weak Sales 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mostly weak in light post-holiday trading as oil prices 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/16, or $3.13 per $1,000 face 
amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 9.01% from 8.98% 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, up from 8.063% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Hits 1990 Lows Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar opened sharply lower against the Japanese yen today in Tokyo, 
hitting 1990 lows against the Asian currency after finishing mixed in Tuesday's 
New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar stood in Tokyo at 142.35 yen in mid-day trading, down from Tuesday's 
144.05-yen finish. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to 143.40 Japanese yen in New York Tuesday, compared to 143.79 
late Friday. U.S. markets were closed Monday for Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Also in New York, the dollar ended at 1.581 German marks Tuesday, compared to 
1.583 in London Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Investors Shy Away from Gold, Silver 
</P>
<P>
Investors burned by last week's gold collapse were reluctant to re-enter the 
precious metals market despite surging oil prices and a lower stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled only slightly higher on the Commodity Exchange with the 
contract for delivery in September up $1.40 at $383.70 an ounce. Silver futures 
lost ground, meanwhile, with September contracts off 4.1 cents at $4.72 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures were widely mixed, orange 
juice futures fell sharply and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.

Icarus Flies: Artist Jim Morphesis has withdrawn a painting commissioned by the 
John Wayne Airport's arts committee after airport officials rejected a poster 
of the work. 
</P>
<P>
His painting of the partially nude legendary Greek figure Icarus was originally 
to appear in a show at the airport opening Friday. In a statement, the New 
York-based artist said the airport administration "reflects a distrust and 
fundamental disrespect for artists." He accused the airport of going along with 
the prevailing mood of arts censorship in this country. Said airport 
commissioner Robert Cashman: "It's a quality art piece, but the timing is not 
right for it." BETH KLEID

Norville's News: Deborah Norville had a scoop for "Today" show viewers Tuesday 
morning: She's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Norville and her husband, art dealer Karl Wellner, are expecting their first 
child on March 6. Weatherman Willard Scott greeted the news by singing a 
lullaby and saying, "March 6 -- do you know what famous American has a birthday 
on March 7?" Norville correctly guessed that it was Scott. Norville, 32, didn't 
say how long she planned to continue working, or how much time she might take 
away from the show after her child is born. BETH KLEID

'CHESS PIECE' FILLS IN SOME LOST HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: LOS ANGELES VISUAL AND PERFORMANCE ARTIST MAY SUN WANTS CHINESE WOMEN 
TO CLAIM THEIR PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a curious fact that in Chinese chess there's no queen. To Shanghai-born 
and Hong Kong-bred Los Angeles visual artist May Sun, the omission is 
culturally symbolic and she has corrected it with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Chinese Chess Piece," a curated festival performance work debuting 
Thursday on a giant chess board of a set on the floor of the gymnasium of the 
Hollywood Methodist Church, there's not a bishop or king in sight. This is a 
game of queens only, thank you -- Chinese women claiming their place in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Sun, a well-known local painter and environmental theater performer, conceives 
projects visually, and her work is characterized by an acute cross-cultural 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always thought of Chinese chess as a format for a theater piece," she 
said, "and the real-life women in this show have always stuck with me. But it 
was my husband (theater director Guy Giarrizzo, who staged the production) who 
came up with the idea of using chess pieces as a metaphor for the characters." 
</P>
<P>
Sun, 35, who emigrated here from Hong Kong when she was 16 and made her way 
into the Los Angeles art world through UCLA and art gallery exhibitions, 
reaches deep into her mainland China roots and her American life to create her 
performance art. "I set out to challenge the image of Asian women as passive 
and submissive," she said. "We want to dramatize strong, pioneering Chinese 
women." 
</P>
<P>
The "we" is Sun and husband Giarrizzo. They merged their disparate racial and 
artistic backgrounds in a collaborative effort on both the script and the set 
design of "Chinese Chess Piece" (which features colorful props, furling banners 
and even a river of real water that divides the basketball court-sized chess 
board). 
</P>
<P>
The production, with an eclectic mix of Chinese, blues guitar and synthesizer 
music, recounts in the manner of a surreal face-off the lives of four women. 
Two of them, movie actress Anna May Wong and aviator Katherine Cheung (now 85 
and living in Chinatown), mirror the role of famous Chinese women in Los 
Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
Among the performers is one of the best-known Asian-American actresses in the 
local Chinese community, Beulah Quo, playing silent and post-silent screen 
actress Anna May Wong as seen toward the end of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Wong, sad and tragic in her personal life (she retired from movies in the early 
'40s at the age of 36) grew into minor cult status and even to something of a 
legend despite -- or because of -- classic Hollywood stereotyping, which 
invariably cast her as the villainess/playgirl/woman of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
The young and beautiful Wong is played by actress Marilyn Tokuda, who also 
portrays the less familiar flyer Cheung, who emigrated to Los Angeles from 
China in the 1920s and became, said Sun, "the first Asian-American woman to get 
a pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the Chinese Amelia Earhart," Sun said, "and, unlike the unhappy Wong, 
had a great life." 
</P>
<P>
Sun herself plays a narrator-dream figure, and actress Jing Hong Zhang, who 
came here three years ago after a career as an opera star in Shanghai and 
Beijing, portrays Sun's real-life aunt (Gong Peng), a former Red Chinese 
political power figure. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two aunts, my mother's older sisters, who marched with Mao," Sun said 
proudly. In fact, the dramatized Peng marched right on to become Chou En-Lai's 
main translator and was China's assistant foreign minister before her death in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
"In the play she personifies the modern Chinese woman and the ancient woman 
warrior," Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
Giarrizzo and Sun, who have been married nine years, boast of an ideal working 
marriage. They collaborated once before, on the 1986 performance piece, "The 
Great Wall or How Red Is My China," which explored the contemporary 
Chinese-American psyche. 
</P>
<P>
But the work that most established Sun's reputation was her 1988 
"L.A./River/China/Town," in which her activist grandfather is seen fighting 
with Sun Yat-Sen in the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and which also dramatized 
the 1871 massacre of 19 Chinese men in downtown Los Angeles. Immigrant history 
is no trivial matter to Sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese chess . . ." Sun mused. "It's funny how historically the game wended 
its way from India to China and then to Europe. But in China they lost or 
dropped the queen. In a sense, these women in our piece are the queens Chinese 
chess doesn't have."

THE WORD'S THE THING AT POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since television came to rule communications, concerned watchers have 
claimed that its pungent pictures are sabotaging the power of spoken and 
written language. You know the kind of thing. A tough TV reporter asks the 
President when he is going to stop sending arms to some Third World tyrant. The 
President pretends he can't hear over the roar of Helicopter One, smiles and 
swoops away amid fluttering flags and smiling children. Everybody out in TV 
Land promptly forgets the tough question, sees the pretty, patriotic picture 
and imagines all is well in the world. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, you wouldn't think such cultural manipulation would have 
much to do with the fine visual arts but, on evidence, it does. After all, 
artists watch the tube too and apparently with some sense of envy and 
competition. But Arthur Artist knows he can't beat CBS, so it has become his 
practice in modern times not to emulate the dominant media but to play the role 
of its poor relative, taking the dross of its castoffs and attempting to 
recycle them alchemically into the gold of timeless art. This has been going on 
ever since Picasso affixed the first popular song sheet to a painting or Kurt 
Schwitters immortalized a gum wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
So if electronic culture wants to trash the written word, art, by golly, will 
rescue it. 
</P>
<P>
All that is the subject of "Crossing the Line: Word and Image in Art" at Pomona 
College's Montgomery Gallery (to Oct. 14) in Claremont. At least I think it is. 
With 106 works by 70 artists from Saul Steinberg to John Baldessari, the 
exhibition is as muddled as it is ambitious. Curator Mary Davis MacNaughton 
tries to make it cover the three decades since 1960 and in her brochure essay 
refers repeatedly to the "variety of media, the diverse ways artists have 
reflected modern experience through the fusion of word and image." Such Noah's 
Ark compendiums have the advantage of open-handedness (as against narrowly 
focused theme shows that try to indoctrinate), but they are so open-ended that 
viewers are virtually left to make up their own story. Here, evidence suggests 
that words crept playfully into contemporary art in the Pop and Photorealist 
imagery of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Pop, in its celebration of everyday life, was accessible, witty, entertaining 
and a refreshing antidote to the bohemian-aristocratic posture of earlier 
modernism. Sometimes it is revealing of the character of the artist, as in Roy 
Lichtenstein's "Crak," where his use of French predicts his eventual status as 
the Cole Porter of Pop art. Often Pop had a kind of insidious social insight 
that now appears downright precognitive. Ed Ruscha's 1966 "Standard Station" 
was a red, white and blue celebration of our gas-guzzling, energy-careless 
culture that looks downright mordant in the light of today's Middle East 
headlines. In 1965, Robert Dowd made a lithograph that suggested the face of 
Vincent van Gogh replace George Washington on the dollar bill, predicting the 
radical commercialization of great art. Robert Cottingham's 1975 "F.W. 
Woolworth" may be the subtlest and saddest of all. It sees the demise of homey 
dime-store America and is rendered in loving, old-fashioned etching technique. 
It seems to mourn visual arts that would become progressively less visual. 
</P>
<P>
The pendulum swung in the bleak '70s when art became stark, inbred and so 
conceptual that there was often nothing to see at all except complicated inbred 
art jokes, like Nam June Paik's "Prepared Typewriter." It offers only a few 
moments of art historical puzzle-solving until we connect it to a covered 
typewriter by Marcel Duchamp. Lawrence Weiner digests even faster in a work 
called "Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust," which is nothing more 
than those words lettered on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, all this was reordered into what MacNaughton calls 
"Neo-Conceptualism," where images and words combine into various forms of 
cultural advertising and self-promotion. Mitchell Syrop offers a 
poster/painting lettered with "This is one of those great masterpieces that 
will go unrecognized in its own time," and goes on to urge the viewer to do 
himself a favor and buy it. Barbara Kruger is represented by one of her 
yup-pified Russian avant-garde agit-prop posters showing a huge blow-up of the 
face of Howdy Doody and the motto, "When I hear the word 'culture,' I reach for 
my checkbook." It's at least as amusing as a New Yorker Hamilton cartoon but 
seems a trifle oblique as the feminist protest it is supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
One of the insistent mysteries of this show is its inclusion of numerous 
artists for whom the use of words is not a central issue. Enlisting talents 
like George Herms, Mark di Suvero, Betye Saar and Roland Reiss seems odd until 
we realize that they tend to share a common profile as visual poets. Armed with 
this clue, we notice that the artists represented by the largest numbers of 
works are Ruscha, Alexis Smith, Allen Ruppersberg, Jasper Johns and Andy 
Warhol. All of them are visually interesting and capable of making rhyming 
juxtapositions of words and images. The single best unfamiliar works in the 
show are Ruppersberg's two big logs, which bear the carved mottoes "Love 
Unafraid" and "The Three Ages of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Poetry equates with painting in its ability to evoke pictures in the mind, 
create physical sensations and suggest the slippery mysteries of real human 
existence as opposed to the coercive limitations of ideology or technology. 
Conceptualism lost when it assumed that the pictures on television somehow made 
artists' pictures obsolete. TV imagery creates no resonant residue of memory, 
offers no incentive for repeated contemplation. It cannot study or record the 
language of the visual with the nuanced care of the fine artist. Intentionally 
or not, the exhibition broadcasts the message that art still only works as 
itself.

'AMAZING GRACE' HITS ROUGH WATERS; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WESTMINSTER NEIGHBORHOOD ASSN. 
FACES QUESTIONS ABOUT SPENDING HABITS AND POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At an age when most people look to retire, 54-year-old E. Grace Payne quit her 
job as manager of an import company to run a struggling poverty program in 
Watts. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster Neighborhood Assn. was so short of funds, Payne said, that she 
used $4,000 of her own money to meet her first payroll. That was in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Payne, a Bradley Administration appointee to the Los Angeles Harbor 
Commission, has built Westminster into one of the largest poverty agencies in 
Los Angeles. With a $1.6-million annual operating budget and 70 employees, her 
organization serves troubled schoolchildren, unwed teen-age mothers, unemployed 
youths and the homeless. Other Westminster projects include the Tom Bradley 
Teen Center, now under construction and made possible by a $1-million gift from 
junk-bond king and convicted felon Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
"They call her 'Amazing Grace,' " attorney Johnnie B. Cochran Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, Payne has encountered a series of setbacks: 
</P>
<P>
* Last fall, the harbor commissioner was chastised by City Council members for 
taking a lead role in approving a $2.4-million deal that benefited a 
businessman who served as a fund-raiser for Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
* In August, United Way placed Westminster on probation and ordered an audit of 
its books. Concerns about Payne's spending of poverty funds, including her 
purchase of a new Lincoln Continental, prompted the actions. 
</P>
<P>
* United Way officials have questioned the propriety of Payne providing about 
$60,000 in Westminster funds to architect Carl Kinsey, a longtime member of the 
agency's board of directors. Kinsey also received up to $50,000 in fees through 
a city-financed Westminster project, even though his past work "revealed a 
number of serious problems," according to a city memo. The state attorney 
general's office said it plans to look into Kinsey's contracts for possible 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Records also show that Payne utilized Westminster personnel and resources to 
help the campaigns of Bradley and Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, although 
political activity is prohibited at nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said in an interview that she has done nothing improper. The 
$52,000-a-year executive director criticized United Way for overreacting to 
allegations by two "disgruntled" former employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I haven't done anything wrong . . . but the implication is there," 
she said. "I'm 72 years old. I've given my life to this. For me to be defending 
myself after 15 years of volunteering for United Way annoys the hell out of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
An energetic, bubbly administrator, Payne makes fund-raising trips nearly every 
Sunday to Presbyterian churches around the country. In 1975, Payne said, she 
solicited more than $500,000 to build Westminster's headquarters on Century 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has received $1.6 million in private donations, $1.4 million in city 
grants and $475,513 in United Way contributions since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the agency unveiled Westminster Park Plaza, the largest complex of 
low-income housing built in Watts since the 1965 riots. The 130-unit project 
was financed by $10 million in city and private loans. 
</P>
<P>
None of the agency's social and housing programs would be possible without 
Payne, said city and Westminster officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Grace Payne is a dynamic, dedicated and respected community leader," Bradley 
said in a statement when contacted by The Times. She "proves day in and day out 
her commitment to the people of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Said Westminster chairman Clinton Minnis: "Our existance is based on the 
goodwill and good reputation of the agency. We have been successful on the 
basis of the cleanliness of Dr. Payne politically, religiously and socially." 
</P>
<P>
Ella Grace Payne grew up in the small Texas town of Gilmer, according to 
resumes at Westminster and the mayor's office, before earning impressive 
credentials -- a BA in education from Texas College, an MBA from UCLA and an 
LL.D. (doctor of laws) from Pepperdine University. She never practiced law, but 
for years has used the title "Dr. Payne," and "LL.D." has appeared next to her 
name on city stationery. 
</P>
<P>
But academic records show that Payne received none of these degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Texas College said that Payne attended school there in 1938 and 
1939 but did not graduate. UCLA and Pepperdine have no record that Payne was 
ever enrolled, although Pepperdine in 1983 awarded her a "distinguished diploma 
of honor" for community service in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Payne acknowledged in an interview that she did not attend UCLA's business 
school and erred by referring to the Pepperdine community service award as a 
doctorate. She said she earned her BA but could not provide proof. 
</P>
<P>
She denied exaggerating her academic record to benefit herself. "I raised money 
long before I was a doctor and it had nothing to do with my being appointed a 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Payne listed her "MBA" on a resume submitted to Bradley, who appointed her to 
the Harbor Commission in 1984. The mayor last week declined to discuss Payne's 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
Payne was reappointed to a second four-year term last fall, despite 
extraordinary criticism from council members during her confirmation hearing. 
They lambasted Payne for her "conflict" in awarding a contract to Kaiser 
International Corp., whose president, Richard Holdaway, served as a Westminster 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me is that you helped orchestrate a vote that cost the Harbor 
Department . . . more than they needed to spend," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
told Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Holdaway had appeared before Payne and other Harbor commissioners on June 28, 
1989, to support a plan to pay Kaiser up to $6 million -- at a 10% profit -- 
for coal-exporting equipment. Kaiser purchased the equipment from the Port of 
Portland to resell it to the city. Critics claimed it would have been cheaper 
for the Harbor Commission to purchase the equipment directly and bypass Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
When Holdaway addressed the commission, Payne said, she became "uncomfortable" 
and left the hearing room. That same day, Holdaway resigned from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Holdaway's resignation, Payne said, freed her to participate in the Kaiser 
matter. On July 12 last year, she voted in favor of the contract, although the 
motion failed on a 2-2 vote. A month later Payne requested another vote and the 
contract was approved, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said she supported a recommendation by the Harbor Department staff, which 
concluded that the contract would save money. 
</P>
<P>
But even Joan Milke Flores, a strong Payne supporter on the City Council, 
criticized the arrangement. "It was a deal put together to benefit Kaiser. Here 
(Payne) has this guy on her board and she's voting for him. And they did it 
without going to bid. I don't know how they got away with it," Flores said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's troubles with United Way followed complaints by two former Westminster 
administrators -- deputy director R. Kato Cooks and accountant Kenneth C. 
Glaspie -- who alleged misappropriation of poverty funds. 
</P>
<P>
Cooks and Glaspie said that Payne controlled a pair of "hidden" checking 
accounts used for questionable expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Glaspie, now accounting manager of the California Restaurant Assn., said he 
resigned in January after less than a year at Westminster when he uncovered a 
variety of financial problems, including improper documentation of cash 
donations to Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had control of the accounting department," Glaspie said. "I never knew 
what was going in and going out." 
</P>
<P>
Several board members said they were unaware of the two checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
More than $1 million was in one account, according to checkbook registers 
provided to United Way for 1988 and 1989. This account was used to pay expenses 
such as $12,800 to board member Carl Kinsey for architectural work and $29,925 
in "loans" to other Westminster programs. 
</P>
<P>
The other account paid for various expenses that included a $7,192 down payment 
and $621 monthly payments for the Lincoln Continental; $3,594 in American 
Express card charges; and food for a Jesse Jackson dinner. 
</P>
<P>
United Way officials found that "fiscal controls and accountability have been 
vested in (Payne's office) with little oversight by the board of directors," 
according to a notice sent to Westminster. While acknowledging the agency's 
"continuing effective services and programs," officials at United Way say they 
may assume control of the books if Westminster fails to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said all the expenses in the two checking accounts were proper. 
</P>
<P>
One account, she said, contained $1 million donated by the Foundations of 
Milken Families for the youth center. Payne said the other account included 
private donations, but no government or United Way funds. 
</P>
<P>
Both accounts were used to bail out other Westminster programs that were 
temporarily short on cash, Payne said. "We have always borrowed money (from) 
wherever we could get money and put it right back." 
</P>
<P>
United Way officials have questioned the car purchase and the payments to 
architect Kinsey. 
</P>
<P>
The car was approved by the Westminster board in February, 1989, Payne said. 
She produced board minutes showing that directors Effie Claybrook and Claudia 
Sims proposed the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Claybrook told The Times that she thought the car was for staff use, not a 
personal car for Payne. Sims and three other board members said they were 
unaware the agency paid for the $32,000 car. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a poverty program," said former board member Cooks. "We figured she 
bought (the car) herself." 
</P>
<P>
The $12,800 in fees paid to Kinsey were part of a $52,000 contract that Payne 
awarded the architect to oversee construction of the teen center, now several 
months behind schedule. He was paid to design Westminster's headquarters in the 
1970s and to help convert a bank building into an infant care center, but 
agency records do not show the amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsey also was hired as a consultant for the Park Plaza project. Last year, 
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency opposed his involvement because his 
"past performance as an architect on several agency-assisted projects was 
unsatisfactory," according to a city memo. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said Kinsey lined up a longtime business associate, Christopher Jones of 
Irvine, as the lead architect for the $250,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsey then "expressed an interest in participating" in the project, Jones 
said. He was paid $35,000 to $50,000, said a source familiar with the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsey and his attorney, William J. Currer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster awarded contracts to Kinsey, Payne said, because he had done 
previous volunteer work for the agency. "Since I was getting it done so much 
cheaper, I didn't even worry about (a conflict)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, it is unlawful for directors of nonprofit agencies to engage in 
"self-dealing" unless other board members approve the arrangement as "the best 
possible deal" and prohibit the interested director from participating in the 
vote. Deputy Atty. Gen. Jim Cordi said his office plans to look into the Kinsey 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster records do not show whether Kinsey participated in any votes or 
discussions involving his own contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the Kinsey case, United Way officials have directed Westminster to 
develop "a written conflict-of-interest policy." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Michael Stewart, an aide to Councilwoman Flores, was forced to resign 
from the Westminster board over other conflict-of-interest concerns. As a 
council deputy, Stewart had successfully lobbied on behalf of Westminster for 
redevelopment funds, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Payne has made a special effort to court two politicians at City Hall -- 
Bradley and Flores, whose district includes Watts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Payne opened a bank account to raise money for Bradley's gubernatorial 
campaign, records show. The account was established under the name "The Bradley 
Bunch" and used Westminster's address and telephone. Invitations to a fund 
raiser at Payne's house instructed anyone interested in the event to contact 
Payne's assistant at the agency. Westminster's restaurant staff catered the 
fund raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The "Bradley Bunch" -- a group of Payne friends -- contributed at least $2,160 
to the mayor's campaign, as shown by a check obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said the use of Westminster resources would violate the agency's city 
contracts, which prohibit any political activity. But, she said, "I don't 
really think we had anybody call in." 
</P>
<P>
Records at Westminster also show that Payne helped gather signatures on 
petitions for Flores' reelection to the City Council last year. Flores' office 
asked the agency to collect the signatures, Payne said, and she assigned a 
Westminster administrator to collect them on his own time. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster officials say they are concerned that their funding sources and 
political contacts will dry up when Payne retires. But Payne said she is 
putting off plans to leave any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I reach a stage where Westminster will not fall apart when I walk out 
the door, I will stay here," she said.

RESERVISTS: SERVING AT NAVY HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
RESERVISTS WHO FILLED BREACH ARE ORIENTED AT NAVY HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wear no more than one ring per hand; necklaces must be long enough to tuck in 
your shirt. Don't get caught in Tijuana after midnight. And, lastly, dress in 
summer whites. 
</P>
<P>
These orders were among the dozens of instructions doled out to almost 300 
reservists who attended orientation Tuesday at the Navy Hospital in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since the onset of the Mideast crisis, 400 of the hospital's 4,500-member staff 
have shipped out to the Mideast. The depleted staff forced a 50% cutback of 
inpatient surgical services and a 20% reduction of outpatient services. The 
hospital, with the help of reservists, will gear back up to 80% of its usual 
workload, said Rear Adm. Robert B. Halder, the hospital's commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult part is over -- we've got most of the reservists on board. 
Now it's a process of orientation and integration," Halder said. "But I don't 
anticipate getting back to full 100% pre-deployment capacity." 
</P>
<P>
To patients, that could mean slightly longer-than-usual waits. But services 
should be better than they have been in recent weeks, hospital officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Across San Diego, 295 reservists in medical professions were called to duty. 
Some went to the Camp Pendleton's hospital; others went to the Navy hospital in 
Oakland. A handful were dispersed across the nation. Most were assigned to the 
Navy Hospital in Balboa Park, which has had to shut five of its 16 operating 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital Tuesday, reserves went through a one-day orientation. Usually, 
the program takes one week, but hospital officials decided to cram everything 
into one day in hopes of getting the new workers in place sooner. 
</P>
<P>
And many who attended the program, held in the auditorium, waxed patriotic 
about the unusual role they play in the Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"With a lot of my counterparts gone, it was an honor for me to be able to help 
out," said Lt. Cmdr. Lynn Gormley, a 36-year-old nurse who lives in Vista and 
had served in the Navy for 12 years before she joined the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was allotted 269 enlisted personnel, 12 doctors and 10 nurses, 
said Lt. Cmdr. Nancy Clancy, a reserve liaison officer with the medical 
facility. In the weeks ahead, the hospital may get another 30, but officials do 
not expect the number to change dramatically, Clancy said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those assigned here, however, hail from states across the country. 
And, for them, the abrupt change in their lives is also a lonely one. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve petty officer Karen Dalziel, 22, had attended the first three days of 
her senior year at University of Iowa when she was called to report. Dalziel, 
who lives in Cedar Rapids, is one of 12 Navy reservists from her landlocked 
state who were called up, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dalziel, who joined the reserves to earn extra money to help get through 
college, will now graduate as an accounting major a semester later than her 
classmates. Married a year, she and her husband have been remodeling a small 
two-bedroom house that they hoped to move into during the weeks ahead. The 
kitchen cabinets and countertops were just installed. 
</P>
<P>
Dalziel was the only member of her reserve unit who was called. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out it was just me, it broke the camel's back," said Dalziel, who 
wept when she learned of her assignment but has since reconciled herself to the 
fluke that landed her miles from home in a city where she knows no one. "It was 
quite a shock." 
</P>
<P>
For Dalziel, however, the blow is not financial, since she is actually earning 
more money than she was as a full-time student. But Cmdr. John W. King, an 
orthopedic surgeon from Scottsdale, Ariz., finds his patriotism has made him 
financially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
King left his wife, their four children, whose ages range from 13 to 7, as well 
as his private practice. With a thriving practice, King, who grew up in a Navy 
family, was earning about $275,000 annually. Under his reserve salary, however, 
he will probably earn less than one quarter of that. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the Navy -- it's one of those ill-defined emotions," said King, who 
served six years in the Navy and five years in the reserves. "Financially, it's 
a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
But his assignment also endangers the livelihood of his four-person staff. For 
the 90-day stint that he has been asked to serve, King will keep paying his 
physician's assistant, two secretaries and office manager. He will also have to 
pay $55,000 in malpractice insurance, as well as office rent. 
</P>
<P>
King now lives in lodgings for Navy officers. His $11-a-day room resembles a 
college dormitory. At home, his wife and children live in their five-bedroom 
house, with a swimming pool, big porch and patio. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I know it's going to work out. It's probably the biggest 
financial setback in my life -- it's a major bump in the road," said King, 43. 
"But I like to focus on the bright side." 
</P>
<P>
For King, that bright side means working with new colleagues as well as having 
the time to exercise, since he figures his hours at the Navy hospital will be 
less rigorous than his usual 14-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial consequences, King, in fact, volunteered for duty in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to be away from my family, I would much rather be where the 
action is," King said. "And I feel I could be much more useful to the guy in 
the trench. I look at the Navy, as they say, as an adventure."

AN APPARENT STROKE PUTS LINDSAY, 89, IN HOSPITAL;

Los Angeles City Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay apparently suffered a stroke 
over the weekend and on Tuesday remained in the intensive care unit at Daniel 
Freeman Hospital in Inglewood, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old councilman, who has been in failing health in recent years, has 
been paralyzed on the right side since he was stricken in his home Sunday 
night, according to his aide, Bob Gay. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said Lindsay is unable to speak and has been drifting in and out of 
consciousness. Doctors planned to perform tests to determine the precise cause 
of Lindsay's trouble, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman said Lindsay was stabilized and in good condition 
Tuesday, but referred all other questions about him to Gay. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lindsay cannot speak, he indicated that he recognized Gay by squeezing 
Gay's hand in response to a question, Gay said Tuesday. The aide added that 
Lindsay has no intention of resigning before his current term ends in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Be assured he's still the councilman," Gay said. "He's still in charge. . . . 
He has given every indication every time I've talked to him that he wants to be 
the councilman in the 9th District. He has no desire to be anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's staff has encouraged him to remain in office, Gay said, because "we 
believe this helps him live a lot longer." 
</P>
<P>
Gay said a team of staff members is running the office, but declined to say 
who, if anyone, has ultimate authority. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, the oldest of the council's 15 members, suffered a stroke in 1988 that 
affected his right hand, but he was able to return to work at City Hall after 
about a month of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last March, Lindsay said he had no plans to step down before 
the election and had not decided whether he will run for another term. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt better in my life," he said. "I can run a 100-yard dash and 
challenge anybody to beat me. . . . I can do anything I want." 
</P>
<P>
However, council members and community activists have said they have noted a 
decline in Lindsay's health and attention span since the 1988 stroke, and some 
suggested last spring that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's district includes some of the most expensive real estate in the city 
as well as some of the city's poorest areas. He is credited with helping to 
engineer the transformation of downtown into an area of gleaming skyscrapers, 
but some critics complain that he has largely ignored the needs of his poorer 
constituents in rundown South-Central neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
With Lindsay absent, the district has no vote in matters that come before the 
city council. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro said Tuesday that Lindsay will probably 
remain in office until he decides to step down. According to the city Charter, 
a council member can be removed from office only if adjudged insane, convicted 
of a felony or recalled by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said he would not call for Lindsay to step down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll support him in anything he decides to do," Ferraro said. "Gil is a 
longtime friend of mine. I went to Harry Truman's inauguration with Gil on a 
chartered airplane. I just love the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Lindsay was hospitalized after he collapsed in the City Hall 
garage while awaiting the arrival of South African civil rights leader Nelson 
Mandela. After a two-week hospital stay, he returned to work and attended 
several City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lindsay was honored by the council for his 50 years of service to 
the city, which he began as a janitor. He was alert and joking with council 
members and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was stricken about 9 p.m. Sunday while he was resting at home, Gay 
said. "Apparently he fell over," he added. A friend pressed a recently 
installed medical emergency button to summon paramedics, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the councilman had an irregular heartbeat, but that condition has 
stabilized, Gay said. Doctors planned to perform an electroencephalogram, a CAT 
scan and an electrocardiogram to determine his condition, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said Lindsay is at times alert, "but he's physically tired and comes in and 
out of it. . . . Obviously, he's a lot older than he was in 1988 and so the 
complications could be a little different. It's difficult to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mississippi in 1900, Lindsay left home when he was a teen-ager and 
served in a segregated unit during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Lindsay went to work as a janitor for the Department of Water and Power. 
Eventually, he was hired as a deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn and in 1963 became the city's first black councilman when he was appointed 
to fill the unexpired term of Ed Roybal, who had been elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay has won reelection handily since then and has had the backing of the 
city's major black leaders.

ONCE-GLAMOROUS FILM PALACE TO FALL TO WRECKING BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each blow from the demolition crew's wrecking ball, a bit of Los Angeles 
history will come crumbling down this week. 
</P>
<P>
The California Theatre, the beaux-arts movie palace that was once a gem of the 
city's downtown theater district, is scheduled to be razed beginning late this 
week and continuing through September. 
</P>
<P>
News of the theater's demolition has created a stir among some in the local 
preservationist community, with angry theater buffs charging that the owners of 
the 72-year-old building have not tried hard enough to save it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good, old building that we think can be restored if the commitment 
were there," said Hillsman Wright, whose downtown-based Los Angeles Historic 
Theater Foundation was unsuccessful in its attempt to have the city designate 
the theater as a historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the California Theatre -- real estate investors and brothers 
Steve, Mark and Dennis Needleman -- contend that they cannot rehabilitate the 
theater. They said they plan to convert the theater grounds at Main and 8th 
streets into a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater is a health hazard, an absolute detriment to the area, a drug 
hangout," said Steve Needleman. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the theater were rehabilitated, Needleman said, the transients, 
prostitutes and junkies who live in the area around the California would 
frighten off potential theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the history of the California reflects the history of the 
neighborhood around it. 
</P>
<P>
When the theater was built in 1918, the community was alive with recreational 
activity. Theaters, clubs and nickelodeons lined the streets, offering a 
variety of diversions. 
</P>
<P>
The California soon became the district's centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Goldwyn Pictures bought the theater in 1919 and hired S.L. Rothaphel, the 
impresario who would become known to the theater world as Roxy, to run it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were producing their own pictures," said Jill Dolan, a member of the 
Historic Theatre Foundation, "so they wanted to feature their own pictures 
there so they wouldn't be busts." 
</P>
<P>
However, after decades of premieres and first-run films, the theater went into 
a slump. As economic activity in the neighborhood declined, so did the 
theater's attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The California became a Spanish-language theater for a while, then was 
transformed into an adult-movie house. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, unable to turn even a marginal profit, the California closed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way for that theater to do business in that location," said Bruce 
Corwin, president of the Metropolitan Theater Corp., which owned the California 
during the 1970s. "The only thing you can do is move on." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's group disagrees. The foundation, which envisions the theater as part 
of a revived downtown entertainment district, argues that a rehabilitated 
California Theatre could spur economic growth in the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience in scores of American cities is that by using these theaters 
and putting things on stage, people will come back downtown after dark," said 
Wright. "They will park their car, eat a meal. Some of them will shop. All of 
this serves to provide jobs, create a tax base." 
</P>
<P>
The Needlemans -- and even other preservationists -- insist that the California 
could never be a vital part of a local entertainment hub. 
</P>
<P>
Some say that the theater's physical location would hamper its profitability. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not one of the Broadway theaters," said Jay Rounds, executive director 
of the Los Angeles Conservancy. "Had it been located on Broadway as part of 
that district, it would have been possible to look at the chance of 
revitalizing it as a part of that group. 
</P>
<P>
"Efforts were made to find a way to save it, but we haven't been able to come 
up with a viable solution. It should come down."

8th streets, above. But the owners contend it cannot be rehabilitated. STEVE

ILLEGAL-ALIEN ARRESTS AT 30-MONTH HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of illegal immigrants arrested in August was the highest in 30 
months in the San Diego area, and overall arrests of aliens have increased 30% 
this year, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 52,440 arrests in August kept pace with a dramatic increase in the number 
of alien arrests along the U.S.-Mexican border -- after a three-year decrease 
-- first reported in April. On Tuesday, Border Patrol Agent Ted Swofford said 
more than 98% of the immigrants arrested in August were Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
The last time more arrests were made in a month was in February, 1988, when 
54,527 arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Border Patrol officials reported a 50% increase in the number of 
arrests between October, 1989, and March, 1990, for the San Diego area, 
contrasted with the corresponding period for 1988-89. Nationwide, the increase 
was slightly more than 30% for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford blamed the increase in illegal immigrants on the deteriorating Mexican 
economy and the easy availability of forged documents in the United States that 
enable many aliens to get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He said a forged visa and Social Security card, both needed to prove to an 
employer that a job seeker is in the United States legally, can be purchased 
for $50 to $150. Under the 1986 law, employers can be fined and jailed for 
knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"The word has gotten back to Mexico that counterfeit documents are relatively 
inexpensive to get. For a few bucks, you can buy a counterfeit immigration 
document and Social Security card, which will enable you to get a job. The 
deterrent factor of the law has been diminished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the immigration law have said it won't put a dent in illegal 
immigration until Congress recognizes the economic, social and political 
reasons that force many Mexicans to leave their country -- legally or illegally 
-- for greater opportunities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents are also arresting more families these days, Swofford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our apprehensions are now about 20% women and kids. Five years ago, they were 
probably no more than 10%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, agents also seized 653 vehicles allegedly used by alien smugglers, 
and 112 of the seized cars were reported stolen. Both figures represent record 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the growing number of apprehensions of vehicles and illegal 
immigrants was an increase by 80 in the number of agents assigned to the San 
Diego area, Swofford said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROLEX ROBBERY SUSPECTS SEIZED AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of snatching a Rolex watch off the wrist of another man in 
Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon was arrested along with an alleged 
accomplice after a five-mile car chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred in the 100 block of South Swall Drive after the victim 
left a car dealership on nearby Wilshire Boulevard, said Beverly Hills Police 
Lt. Robert Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
As the man prepared to drive off, Curtis said, one of the suspects reached into 
the vehicle and began wrenching the pricey President model Rolex from the man's 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who saw the ensuing struggle called police, then chased the suspect 
as he escaped in a waiting vehicle, Curtis said. Police eventually pulled over 
the car and the suspects -- identified by Curtis as Rex Carlton Thomas, 23, and 
Gary Hayashi, 25, both of Los Angeles -- gave up. They were to be booked on 
suspicion of robbery and other charges, Curtis said. The stolen watch and a gun 
were recovered, he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-six people, including two in San Diego County, were killed on the state's 
highways over the Labor Day weekend, the California Highway Patrol said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic deaths statewide rose from 30 last year, but dropped from four in San 
Diego County, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Donnelly, 25, of Huntington Beach died Sunday when his motorcycle slammed 
into a pickup near Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said Donnelly was traveling about 65 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone when he 
tried to take a curve on San Vicente Road just east of Wildcat Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, a 40-year-old Danish woman was killed and 11 people were injured 
in a three-car accident on Interstate 5 near La Costa. Rita Korfgaard was dead 
at the scene, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it had 80% of its available officers working to target speeders 
and drunk drivers along I-5, I-15 and other state highways during the three-day 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of people cited for speeding was not available, the CHP 
said, officers arrested 2,447 people statewide for driving under the influence, 
187 of them in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the agency made 154 arrests locally for driving under the influence.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LATINO LEADERS CALL FOR OUSTER OF 
SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a federal finding that Los Angeles County's Health Services Department 
discriminated against Latinos, community leaders Tuesday said on-the-job bias 
will continue until the supervisors are voted out of office. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only thing we can continue to do is to work to vote them (the 
supervisors) out," said Raul Nunez of the Los Angeles County Chicano Employees 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused the county 
of job discrimination, singling out County-USC and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
medical centers for failing to hire and promote Latinos. County officials have 
said under-representation of Latinos in the county work force is the result of 
slowed hirings due to budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the supervisors called for a county study of Health Services 
Department hiring practices.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN THROWN OUT OF BAR DIES OF HEAD INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lawndale man who suffered massive head injuries Saturday when a bouncer 
allegedly threw him out of a Redondo Beach bar died Tuesday of his injuries at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Alvey, 25, had fought with another patron shortly after midnight in the 
bar of Pancho and Wong's restaurant when the "door host," Eric Charles Meyer, 
intervened, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than escorting Alvey out, Meyer allegedly took the man to the bar's back 
door and threw him off the deck, down four stairs and onto the asphalt, police 
said. Alvey was rushed to the hospital, where he died at 7:20 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, 32, of Torrance was booked Saturday at the Redondo Beach Jail on 
suspicion of attempted murder. Authorities were unavailable for comment Tuesday 
on whether the charges would be changed because of Alvey's death.

BOTH SIDES EDGE CLOSER TO COMPROMISE IN REDISTRICTING DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to avoid a costly and lengthy trial, the two sides in San Diego's 
protracted redistricting dispute met with a federal magistrate Tuesday and made 
progress toward a compromise to improve minority voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of acrimonious debate over the redistricting map that was approved 
by the San Diego City Council last week, the session with U.S. Magistrate Harry 
McCue appeared to bring the two sides closer by producing yet another map with 
a statistically -- and politically -- significant increase in the Latino 
population in the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council's map, the 8th District -- the linchpin to any settlement in 
the voting rights dispute because of its heavy concentration of Latino 
residents -- would include a 51.9% Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposals made Tuesday by representatives of the Chicano 
Federation of San Diego County could raise the percentage of Latinos in the 
southern San Diego district, which extends from downtown to San Ysidro, to 
about 55%. 
</P>
<P>
After their nearly five-hour, closed-door meeting Tuesday, rival attorneys -- 
using some of the most conciliatory language heard in weeks -- expressed 
optimism about avoiding a trial that could leave the city's political future in 
legal limbo for years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is at least an outside chance that a tentative settlement -- one 
that would have to be approved both by the full council and, presumably, a 
federal judge overseeing the case -- could be reached today, when the two sides 
are scheduled to meet privately again with McCue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good objective starting point for discussions," attorney David 
Lundin, who represents three of the five council members who supported the 
redistricting map, said after Tuesday's session. "I think we're well along." 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely made a lot of progress today," added Chicano Federation attorney 
Michael Aguirre. "We don't want to raise people's expectations. . . But things 
are moving in a positive direction." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last Friday, the dispute stemming from the Chicano Federation's 
voting rights lawsuit seemed destined for a trial that U.S. District Judge John 
Rhoades warned would be a "difficult, expensive and time-consuming" process. 
</P>
<P>
In an order that he described as the first step in that direction, Rhoades on 
Friday ordered council members and others to testify under oath about the 
council-passed redistricting map, which the Chicano Federation contends 
unconstitutionally dilutes minority voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting with McCue, in fact, was expected to be a routine procedural 
session to prepare a schedule for those depositions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, McCue, as he has from the outset, prodded the two sides to try once 
more to reach a compromise that could preclude the need for a divisive trial. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's 14-page order, Rhoades, lamenting the two sides' inability to 
"resolve what is basically a legislative, not judicial, function," noted that a 
settlement "requires that each side give up positions previously held." 
</P>
<P>
Based on Tuesday's progress, it appears that the city is willing to travel 
farther to reach a middle ground than the Chicano Federation. If the Latino 
population in the 8th District were, in fact, increased by about 3 percentage 
points, that would help the Latino group realize one of its overriding goals in 
the case by improving Latino candidates' chances for success in council 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Wary of unraveling what he called a "last-ditch effort" for a compromise, 
Aguirre went to lengths Tuesday not to claim the upper hand in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to get into who's backed down or not backed down," Aguirre said. 
"No one's trying to characterize this as a victory for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The tenuous nature of the negotiations, moreover, was underlined by Lundin's 
failure to resist sniping at Aguirre, despite efforts to introduce comity into 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asking him for two months to give us a map or statistics which he 
felt would satisfy (the Chicano Federation)," Lundin said. "Up until five 
minutes ago, he hadn't done that. That was a moving target. Now we've got a 
stationary target." 
</P>
<P>
Given the history of the redistricting case, which has careened between City 
Hall and federal courtrooms since early July, both sides were reluctant to be 
too rosy in their projections of a settlement that could end the long-running 
political-legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Aguirre noted, should this latest bid fail, the prospect of a trial 
still looms. Plans for the possible sworn interrogation of council members 
about the volatile redistricting issue, the lawyer said, are "proceeding on a 
parallel track." 
</P>

"The judge would like to see this thing settled, as we would and, I think, the 
city would, too," Aguirre said. "Things look more encouraging. But that doesn't 
mean we're counting on this working out. If it doesn't, we'll be ready to go 
ahead with the other option."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HALF-CENT TRANSIT TAX BALLOT MEASURE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisors on Tuesday authorized a Nov. 6 ballot measure 
that would raise the sales tax by a half-cent for public transit projects, 
despite a measure seeking more money for jails. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the two measures would be in conflict because the sales tax would 
exceed the 7 1/4% cap imposed by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The tax is now 6 3/4%, leaving only a half-cent increase available. To solve 
the problem, the Legislature last week approved a measure allowing the jails 
and the transit sector to share the new revenue on a quarter-cent basis. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation measure is known as the Anti-Gridlock Transit Improvement 
Fund. It would raise about $400 million a year, which could be designated for 
improved public transit. The competing measure would raise a similar sum for 
construction and operation of jails.

PUBLIC HOUSING TENANTS TO LEARN SELF-RULE; 
</P>
<P>
NICKERSON GARDENS: HUD SECRETARY KEMP PRESIDES OVER OFFICIAL OPENING OF 
YEARLONG TRAINING PROGRAM SEEN AS ONE ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OF CRIME AND 
VANDALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some of the thousands of people who live in Nickerson Gardens will start going 
to class this week for lessons in how to take over their housing project, the 
largest in Los Angeles and one of the most troubled. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Nickerson Gardens residents are expected to show up for the beginning 
of a yearlong series of training sessions intended to help them form a 
management corporation that would gradually replace the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority in running the Watts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of many being launched in public housing projects around the 
country as the Bush Administration promotes tenant management and even 
ownership as answers to the festering problems of crime and vandalism that 
riddle many public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) want to make sure that every resident of public housing in the United 
States of America from Watts to East Los Angeles to the South Bronx to East 
Harlem has the opportunity to manage their own public housing and someday to 
own it if that's their dream," Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban 
development, said Tuesday before a crowd that filled a gymnasium at Nickerson 
Gardens to mark the official start of the training program. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp shared the stage with several other dignitaries, including Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), all of whom praised 
the trend toward tenant management as the beginning of a new era in public 
housing. "Nickerson is ready," declared Waters, who described herself as a 
child of St. Louis' housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The management training -- open to all adult Nickerson residents -- is being 
paid for by a $93,000 HUD grant, one of five such grants given to Los Angeles 
public housing projects. The others will go to the Estrada Courts, Jordan 
Downs, Normont Terrace and Pico Aliso projects. 
</P>
<P>
Nickerson has hired Bertha Gilkey to run the sessions, which will be held three 
times a month for the next year. Gilkey, a seemingly irrepressible advocate of 
tenant rights, is known nationally for helping notoriously bad housing 
projects, such as Cochran Gardens in St. Louis, clean up by putting the people 
who live there in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to the 6 million people in public housing in this country . . . it is 
time to challenge the system. . . . Who can better manage us than us?" Gilkey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are now more than a dozen public housing developments around the country 
that are run at least in part by tenants, and efforts are under way to start 
similar programs at more than 100 other housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp also announced that the Los Angeles Housing Authority will get $18 million 
this fiscal year to make improvements at its housing projects. Last year the 
authority received nearly $15 million for repairs and improvements, but housing 
officials say it would take more than $200 million to do all the improvement 
work they would like to do.

BACTERIA LEVEL STILL HIGH; CASTAIC LAKE USE RESTRICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restrictions imposed this summer on weekend use of Castaic Lake, one of the 
region's largest boating and swimming facilities, will remain in effect 
indefinitely as the county explores ways to reduce the bacterial level in the 
lake's four designated swimming areas, county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't ignore it," said Brian Roney, assistant superintendent of the 
lake, referring to water quality tests indicating that on weekends, when the 
lake's shallow swimming areas are crowded, the water is unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend tests, conducted since July, found high levels of bacteria such as 
that present in human intestines. The bacteria can cause diarrhea and fever, 
although Department of Health Services officials stressed that there have been 
no reports of human illness as a result of the bacterial levels and said the 
restrictions are precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
To adress the problem, health and recreation officials have limited the number 
of people allowed to visit the lake to 1,500 carloads at any time, and are 
limiting the number of swimmers to about 800. No restrictions have been placed 
on the number of boaters. 
</P>
<P>
The perimeter of the Castaic Lake swimming area, about 10 miles north of Santa 
Clarita, will remain fenced on weekends to keep out visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions at the county-operated lake have been in place since July 27. 
Earlier that month, tests by the Department of Health Services, for the first 
time in eight years, found that the bacterial levels in Castaic Lake's swimming 
areas had climbed to unsafe levels. 
</P>
<P>
Health department officials said drinking water, supplied by an adjacent 
2,235-acre reservoir separated from the lake by a dam, is not threatened by the 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Although tests Aug. 19 and Aug. 26 found safe bacterial levels, the county 
Department of Parks and Recreation closed the lake's swim areas during the busy 
Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Tests done over the weekend showed that bacterial levels in the swimming area 
were unsafe, even though tests done during the week indicated no problems, said 
Ralph Lopez, the county's deputy of environmental health. He said he was "taken 
aback by the results." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the troubling test results, he said, the Parks and Recreation 
Department installed additional portable toilets around the lake and instituted 
the weekend restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The county began routinely testing Castaic Lake on weekends only this summer, 
said Russ Johnson, an environmental health specialist for the Health Services 
Department. He acknowledged that weekend bacterial levels at the lake may have 
been unsafe in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good question that has come up now and then," he said. "In the summer, 
in times past, we never really knew." 
</P>
<P>
County officials believe the rising bacterial levels reflect increasing use of 
the lake by swimmers, not contamination from animals or a leak in the sewage 
system, Roney said. Last year 1.5 million people visited the lake, compared 
with 900,000 in 1986, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county previously closed the lake's swimming areas for much of the summer 
of 1982 because of high bacteria levels, Roney said. The parks department hired 
a consultant, at a cost of $30,000, to identify the cause of the problem and 
ways to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant determined that the problem was caused by people using the lake 
and animals emitting waste into it, not by a sewer leak, which would have been 
simpler to rectify, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the county installed a submerged aerator to circulate water throughout 
the lake, weekday tests showed safe levels of bacteria, Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
Another cause of the lake's high bacterial levels may be the region's ongoing 
drought, said Cal Miller, an environmental health specialist for the 
department. The lack of rain has made the state, which owns the adjacent 
reservoir, reluctant to release water into the county-owned lake, he said. Thus 
bacteria in the lake have not been flushed out. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions on weekend use of the recreational lake have rankled area 
merchants, who depend on the summer season -- especially on holidays such as 
Labor Day -- for much of their business. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure that they're not screaming wolf," said Jeff Preach, vice 
president of the Castaic Chamber of Commerce. He said local businesses have 
complained to him about the weekend restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
As merchants complain and many weekend swimmers stay dry, county officials are 
exploring ways to solve what they expect will continue to be a problem at the 
lake's beaches, scheduled to close for the summer on Sept. 22. One option, 
Roney said, is to install a second underwater aerator in the lake, at a cost of 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another is to dig up the sand under the swimming areas and lay a system of 
pipes to inject chlorine into the water during periods of high use. The pipes 
would cost up to $100,000 to install, he said, and the chlorine needed for an 
average weekend would cost $1,500.

The lemon slush and bottled water will flow freely, but alcoholic beverages 
will not be on tap during UCLA's home football games at the Rose Bowl this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A trial, one-year no-alcohol sales period begins Saturday at the Bruins' home 
season opener against the University of Oklahoma, stadium officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on beer and other alcoholic beverages has been planned for more than a 
year as part of a drive by UCLA and Pasadena city officials to encourage a more 
family-oriented environment, said Rose Bowl General Manager Greg Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors will hawk a lemon slush beverage from portable carts, and bottled 
water, nonalcoholic beer and soft drinks will be available. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty fans can also console themselves with an expanded food menu, including 
fish and chips, polish sausages, chicken wings, nacho dogs and fish tacos, 
which will be sold from new stands on both sides of the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the no-alcohol policy, fans will be prohibited, as before, from 
carrying cans and bottles into the stadium. Under a new rule, they will also be 
prevented from leaving the stadium and returning during halftime.

LONG BEACH STUDENTS START YEAR WITH COURSE IN CHAOS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE SEMESTER BEGINS WITH RECORD ENROLLMENT FOR THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT 
AND LITTLE ROOM TO MOVE. A RECITAL HALL WHERE ROOF COLLAPSED AND FIVE OTHER 
BUILDINGS REMAIN CLOSED.

<P>
At the Cal State Long Beach music department, where a recital hall came 
crashing down this summer and five more buildings have been declared unsafe, 
the fall semester that began Tuesday sounded something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't I be in A-100?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because that's the building where the roof fell down." 
</P>
<P>
Students paced in confusion, there was no place to store their instruments, the 
wind symphony was relegated to a local church and the walk to Music 
Appreciation was a two-mile trek, uphill. 
</P>
<P>
Why the 120-ton roof of the empty Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall collapsed July 
2 remains under investigation. Vital lecture and rehearsal areas in the 
$6.3-million complex are off limits for the semester. 
</P>
<P>
But classes began anyway. And if there is such a thing as managed chaos, this 
was it. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., Francisco Garcia, a 25-year-old senior, sat in the shade behind a 
metal desk, "The Planets" by Gustav Holst booming from a tape player next to 
his left foot. A line of befuddled students, eyes glazed, stretched before him. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's job was to direct students to the classroom space found by faculty 
working frantically through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are a little displeased," he said as a sophomore with an armload 
of books walked toward the opposite end of campus, cursing. 
</P>
<P>
It was going to be a long semester. 
</P>
<P>
A team of structural engineers hired to investigate the collapse had, at one 
time, shut down the collapsed hall and seven other buildings, while flagging 
six others as possibly unsafe. Shortly before school began, two of the closed 
buildings reopened -- hardly enough to accommodate a record enrollment of more 
than 2,000 music students. 
</P>
<P>
Rehearsal space was rented from a nearby church for about $9,000, an added 
burden for a university already facing a $5-million shortage in state money 
this year, officials said. A student union and theater were converted to 
classrooms and at least one Mozart opera -- scheduled in the collapsed recital 
hall -- will be held aboard the Queen Mary (the one decided plus in the whole 
ordeal, faculty members said.) 
</P>
<P>
"You want some insight into how lousy this place is built?" asked a senior who 
declined to give his name, plucking a tune on a borrowed guitar while awaiting 
his clarinet class. "The roof leaked horribly in the recital hall. You could 
see light in between the seams of the locker room walls. And look at these 
beams," he said, glowering upward. "I'm just a humble music major, but it's 
pretty obvious they didn't do a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that the beams covering a concrete walkway were held together 
by Elmer's glue. But by the day's end, there seemed to be a place for everyone, 
however inconvenient. The students held limited faith that the buildings 
declared safe really were. 
</P>
<P>
"We've practiced in these rooms for a long time," Garcia said. "We've dealt 
with rain leaking through the roof, thinking it was just that -- rain. Looking 
back, any of those rooms could have given way. It's really scary."

The ambassadors and other representatives of 12 African nations ventured out of 
their Washington embassies Tuesday to make contact with Americans who could 
help bring investments to their developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here . . . to arouse some interest in whatever we have to offer," Paul 
Desire Kabore, Burkina Faso's ambassador to the United States, said after

</P>
<P>
The delegation, which included eight ambassadors, came to Los Angeles to 
explore trade and economic opportunities with local businesses, and develop

</P>
<P>
The delegation's visit was initiated by the diplomats, not Bradley's Africa/Los 
Angeles Trade Task Force, a city-financed committee he appointed to encourage

A stray bullet apparently intended for a gang member shattered the back window 
of a pickup truck and killed a woman inside as she waited for a ride home, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The truck owner's 5-year-old son was cut by fragments from the shattered rear 
window in the attack in the 2400 block of Ellendale Place in South-Central Los 
Angeles on Monday night, Detective Paul Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Cifuentes, 34, was sitting in the pickup as the driver warmed up the

</P>
<P>
The perimeter of the Castaic Lake swim area, about 10 miles north of Santa

said. And the number of weekend swimmers will continue to be limited to about 
800, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boating activities, however, are not affected by the swimming restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions at the county-operated lake have been in place since July 27. 
Earlier that month, tests by the Department of Health Services found, for the

needed for an average weekend would cost $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
A third possibility would be to install a system that takes oxygen from the air 
and turns it into ozone, a nontoxic chemical that fights bacteria, blowing out 
the ozone underwater. 
</P>
<P>
But that system, which would cost roughly $50,000, worked poorly in a recent 
test at the lake, Roney said.

OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER 2ND CHATSWORTH COURTHOUSE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday instructed county 
officials to examine an alternative site for the proposed West Valley Municipal 
Courthouse that court officials are planning to build near a Chatsworth 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the board told Robert Quist, a 
deputy court administrator, to discuss with the owner the availability of 
another parcel of Chatsworth land at 9200 Mason Ave., property that court 
officials previously had rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are asking for is for the court to seriously look at this site," 
Antonovich said of the Mason Avenue location. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the board has asked court officials to reexamine a 
piece of property that they had turned down for a courthouse site. 
</P>
<P>
Quist has recommended that the county buy a nine-acre parcel at Plummer Street 
and Winnetka Avenue for the three-story courthouse. Last month, the board 
instructed Quist to enter into price negotiations with owner Alexander Haagen, 
who bought the property for $10 million last winter. 
</P>
<P>
But a coalition of Chatsworth homeowners has mounted an intense campaign 
against the Plummer Street site, complaining that it would generate traffic 
congestion and graffiti, increase crime and reduce property values in a nearby 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich has sided with homeowners and has been looking for alternative 
sites. Last month, he asked court officials to evaluate a lumberyard site on 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard, which was later rejected by the court because it was 
too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Mason Avenue property sent a letter to board members last week 
complaining that his parcel was not thoroughly reviewed by court officials. In 
the letter, Stephen A. Farley, chief financial officer of Allegretti &amp; Co., 
called his 11-acre parcel a "viable alternative" to the Haagen site and said he 
was perplexed that it was eliminated from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
But Quist told the board Tuesday that the Allegretti property was too expensive 
and narrow and was handicapped by poor access. The county also would have to 
pay to demolish existing structures on the property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But after he left the meeting, Quist said he would be happy to meet with 
Allegretti representatives again. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have earthshaking numbers, we'd be glad to entertain them," Quist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Farley alleged that the county was mistakenly representing that 
Allegretti's selling price was $16 million. Farley said he told county 
officials that the property was appraised at roughly $16 million but that 
Allegretti was willing to sell for $12 million to $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Farley also said that the selection of his company's property, located south of 
Prairie Street, would appease homeowner opponents who said they wanted the 
courthouse built below Prairie. 
</P>
<P>
"I am genuinely perplexed at the seemingly callous disregard and inattention to 
the concerns of the local citizenry," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Farley's statements, Quist, who had not seen the letter, 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to negotiate this in the paper," Quist said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHOOTING VICTIM, DRIVER HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shooting victim and a good Samaritan who was driving him to the hospital were 
injured Tuesday morning when their car crashed and overturned in Mission Hills, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting victim, Anthony Christianson, 24, of Thousand Oaks, was then taken 
by ambulance to the Northridge Hospital Medical Center and was in stable 
condition after being treated for a gunshot wound to the chest and cuts and 
bruises from the car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to name the car's driver, who also suffered minor injuries in 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Harvie Eubank said the incident began about 3:30 a.m. when Christianson 
pulled into a service station at Nordhoff Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and 
was confronted by a gunman who demanded money and shot him in the chest. The 
gunman fled on foot without taking anything. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Christianson went into the service station and asked 
for help getting to a hospital because he did not want police or paramedics 
called. 
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old customer who was in the store volunteered to drive Christianson's 
car and take him to a hospital, police said. But as he drove the car onto a 
nearby Sepulveda Boulevard on-ramp of the Simi Valley Freeway, the car swerved, 
hit a truck and went off the road and flipped, police said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR $25,000 ARSON BOUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday extended the time period to 
qualify for rewards for identifying arsonists who set fires this summer in 
Glendale and the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The reward period for both fires will be extended to Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The board had earlier approved $25,000 rewards for the apprehension and 
conviction of the arsonists who set the Glendale fire on June 26 and the Santa 
Clarita Valley fire on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale blaze destroyed 46 homes and partially damaged 20 others. In the 
Santa Clarita fire, 625 acres were burned and several firefighters sustained 
minor injuries.

PART-TIME TEACHERS BRING IN REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amy Pyle's article on the community college budget squeeze mentions that at 
Valley and Pierce colleges, full-time instructors probably will be asked to 
teach some of the more popular night and weekend classes usually taught by 
part-time faculty. It also mentions that state funding is based on enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The current salary for a part-time teacher carrying a load of six units per 
semester in the Los Angeles Community College District is about $8,300 a year, 
or slightly more than $2,000 per three-unit, 19-week class. The current salary 
for a full-time instructor with a load of from 12 to 17 units is $45,000, or 
around $5,000 per class. 
</P>
<P>
Yet evening classes are more popular. Enrollment in evening classes runs as 
high as 65 students, compared to 25 or 30 in the daytime. Typically, 40 of the 
65 will finish an evening class, while only 10 or 15 will finish a day class. 
</P>
<P>
Evening teachers handle twice as many students for less than half the salary. 
They bring in the bulk of the revenue and are paid a salary (prorated to 
$20,000 a year with no benefits) less than most high school graduates can 
command. These are teachers with master's or even doctoral degrees and 10 to 25 
years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
These are the teachers Valley and Pierce propose to lay off.

ROBERT L. BUA; CO-FOUNDED NONPROFIT AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert L. Bua, chief executive officer of Bridge Focus Inc., a nonprofit 
organization with two alcohol and drug prevention and intervention centers in 
the San Fernando Valley, has died in Burbank. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
Bua died Sunday of lymphatic cancer, said Leah Bridger, clinical services 
director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Glendale, Bua graduated from Glendale Academy in 1964 and 
began working in the youth services field. In late 1960s, he co-founded Bridge: 
A Way Across Inc., a nonprofit alcohol and drug prevention and intervention 
center in Burbank that received several Los Angeles County grants, including 
one to develop a model for community-oriented alcohol abuse prevention. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, Bua's organization merged with Panorama City-based Focus 
Center for Education &amp; Development to create Bridge Focus Inc., which 
operates in Burbank and Panorama City. Bua became chief executive officer and 
president of the Bridge Focus board of directors, Bridger said. 
</P>
<P>
Bua is survived by his parents, Joseph and Stella Bua of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is planned for 9 a.m. Thursday at Church of the Hills at 
Forest Lawn Memorial Park-Hollywood Hills, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive. Arrangements 
were made by Forest Lawn Mortuary in Glendale. Donations can be made in Bua's 
name to Bridge Focus Inc.

SIERRA MADRE TRIES AGAIN TO PLAN HILLSIDE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hillside development ordinance is again making the rounds in Sierra Madre, 
the third such attempt in two years to preserve the San Gabriel Mountain 
foothills that provide a backdrop to this small town. 
</P>
<P>
This version -- devised after seven months of work by a task force of land-use 
attorneys, hillside property owners and conservationists -- could replace the 
strict ordinance now on the books with one even stricter. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a maximum of about 100 houses allowed under the current hillside 
development ordinance, the proposed ordinance would permit only about 65, said 
Dale Beland, a land-use consultant hired by the Hillside Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Yet task force member Gurdon Miller said the proposed ordinance has met with 
more acceptance from conservationists and property owners than previous 
versions devised by the Planning Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the council, the ordinance could end two years of haggling, 
moratoriums, last-minute ordinances and a lawsuit by one hillside property 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the greater acceptance, Miller said, is that the new ordinance 
thoroughly maps the slopes and geological features on the 557 acres of 
hillsides above the town. Development is then based on those features and the 
slope of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"From a technical standpoint, this is one of the most thoroughly done and 
tailor-made hillside ordinances ever proposed," said Miller, a Los Angeles city 
senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the way ordinances are usually prepared. It's a handmade ordinance. 
The ordinance was written by people who live in Sierra Madre and care about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Aerial photographs and computers were used to create a detailed topographic 
map, Miller said. Property owner Ted Willis photographed the hillsides from 
city streets to determine view lines and other property owners chipped in to 
pay consultant Beland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was presented last week during a joint meeting of the task force, 
the Planning Commission and the City Council. As outlined by Beland, the 
ordinance does away with five development zones imposed vertically on the 
hillsides under the current ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of zones of density ranging from one house per 15,000 square feet to 
one house per 40 acres, the new ordinance uses a density formula based on the 
steepness of the slopes and the size of the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, slopes of up to 15% may contain a maximum of three structures per 
acre, slopes from 15% to 20% a maximum of two structures per acre, 20% to 25% 
one structure per two acres, and 25% and above one structure per 100 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Imposed on this grid is a series of building prohibitions based on geological 
features. Construction is not permitted within 100 feet of a ridge line, on 
stream beds or vegetation areas, or near hiking trails or historic structures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is stricter (than the current ordinance) but more importantly, the 
proposed ordinance is sensitive to environmental conditions, things that you 
can actually show: streams, slopes, ridges," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance also contains a unique feature in that building is allowed on 
areas that cannot be seen from the town's streets. It also excludes most of the 
flat land owned by the Passionist Fathers retreat house from the hillside 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission will hold a study session Thursday to discuss concerns 
about density, the bottom boundary line and the elimination of requirements for 
curbs, gutters and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the City Council must consider an environmental impact report. 
Work on the ordinance is expected to continue for months.

GERMANY: ONE NATION, TWO PEOPLES?;

EXPERIENCES SINCE WORLD WAR II HAVE CREATED DISTINCT EASTERN AND WESTERN 
MIND-SETS. LEADERS WORRY ABOUT MERGING THEM.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its carefully measured mix of sex, sports and politics, West Germany's 
biggest newspaper, Bild Zeitung, knows exactly how to grab reader attention. 
</P>
<P>
"East German Women Are Better in Bed!" it heralded in a half-page-deep 
front-page headline early in the unification process. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, readers were treated to a bizarre flurry of front-page 
pseudo-analysis about that questionable claim which seemed to achieve little 
other than stoke male imagination and boost Bild's 4-million-plus daily 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in its own way, the paper had underscored a deeper reality: Whatever the 
validity of its story, there is little doubt that East and West Germans are 
very different people who often know surprisingly little about each other and 
sometimes seem not to want to know. 
</P>
<P>
As an awareness of the size of these differences begins to dawn, political 
leaders and social scientists from both sides of the disappearing political 
divide worry that merging the two German consciousnesses is likely to be among 
the most delicate, least understood aspects of unification. 
</P>
<P>
The cry: "Wir sind ein Volk!" -- We are one people! -- that thundered from the 
streets of East German cities last fall and brought one of Europe's most 
entrenched dictatorships to its knees may have been politically effective, but, 
in truth, it frequently rings hollow. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience of recent weeks has shown how different we really are," East 
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said during a break from intensive 
inter-German negotiations last week. "That's why I push so hard during my 
travels for youth exchanges. It is the next generation, our children, who've 
got to" bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has experienced both Germanys since the Berlin Wall opened last 
November would find it hard to dispute De Maiziere's comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Separates Them 
</P>
<P>
There has been intense mixing among East and West Germans in the almost 10 
months since that event, but so much still separates them as they move toward 
unity that it is often hard to describe unification as a joint experience. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans live in a healthy, environmentally clean, politically stable 
country whose industry has a 5% growth rate, and the prospects for continued 
prosperity look nothing but bright. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans are saddled with one of the filthiest environments in the 
industrialized world and face rocketing unemployment and an economy that is 
declining at a rate of 7% a year. And a recent investigation disclosed that 68 
of its 400 recently elected members of Parliament are believed to have been 
involved in secret police activities during the Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion surveys conducted mainly by West German polling companies have 
highlighted some other differences. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's respected Allensbach Research Institute, for example, found 
indications in a series of polls conducted early this year that East Germans 
place a far greater emphasis on traditional German values, such as punctuality, 
orderliness, good manners and modesty, than do their West German cousins. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, West Germans gave higher ratings to such matters as personal 
grooming and having a good figure. 
</P>
<P>
"East German attitudes are the same as we had in the 1950s and 1960s," said 
Allensbach Executive Director Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann. "It is as if we were 
going back to the Germany of the Wirtschaftwunder" -- West Germany's postwar 
economic miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Noelle-Neumann argued that these value differences stemmed in part from the 
late 1960s era of student rebellion, a phase that lasted only a few years in 
the United States but which has never really completely ended in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"In West Germany, it was felt you could change society if you could educate the 
child to challenge its parents," she said. "That is what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
But, even to the casual observer in a city like Berlin, where Germans East and 
West mix freely, there are hints of far deeper differences. 
</P>
<P>
Universal access to the hard West German mark since July 1 may have signaled an 
end to the cheap shoes and drab clothes that once made it so easy to spot East 
Germans among their flashier-clad Western cousins, but other hints, including 
body language, remain, the legacy of 40 years of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, West German heads tend to be held higher, their faces are more open, 
their walk and manner generally more confident. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a timidity, an inner barrier in so many East German faces that I 
don't see in the West," said Marlene Vlack, who worked for the East German film 
company, Defa, before fleeing to the West last year. "It's like a snail 
withdrawn into its shell." 
</P>
<P>
The West German diplomat-author Guenter Gauss, who served as his country's 
first permanent representative to East Berlin in the 1970s, coined the phrase 
"niche society" to describe an East Germany in which people spoke freely only 
with close friends in the quiet, well-protected niches of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
By force of habit, people often buried their innermost thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Emotion 
</P>
<P>
The director of the Dresden State Theatre, Wolfgang Engel, who is about to 
begin a three-month guest directorship at the Burg Theatre in Vienna, remarked 
during a recent radio interview that Western actors managed to express internal 
emotion better and more freely than their East German counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans themselves are quick to note the distinctions that separate them. 
</P>
<P>
East of the Berlin Wall, locals speak of "the Wessies" -- loud, arrogant, 
impatient, superficial and full of material values. 
</P>
<P>
"For a Wessie, he's not a bad type," one young East German woman was overheard 
telling a friend when waiting for a subway train in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, West Germans frequently describe their Eastern brethren -- 
"Ossies" or "Easties" -- as unsophisticated, ill-motivated and, occasionally, 
just plain lazy. 
</P>
<P>
A correspondent of the leading West German illustrated weekly Stern recalled an 
incident that occurred when he was talking with a group of striking East German 
coal miners near the small town of Bleicherode, close by the old inter-German 
frontier. A passing West German driver slowed his car, surveyed the miners, 
then screamed out a lowered window: "Why don't you finally get to work, you 
lazy pigs!" 
</P>
<P>
(Ironically, public opinion surveys show that East Germans enjoy their hours at 
work more than do West Germans.) 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the differences between "Ossie" and "Wessie" more visible than on 
the streets and highways in and around Berlin, where the two mentalities -- 
sometimes literally -- crash together. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of more aggressive West German drivers, apparently incapable of 
adjusting their fast-paced habits to East Germany's poor-quality roads and 
slower traffic, has propelled road accident statistics in East Germany to new 
heights during the seven months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing what he called "a tragic new record," East German Police Director 
Rolf Lorenz noted that half of the 40,000 accidents had been caused either by 
excessive speed or failure to yield the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
In one typical, particularly comical, scene witnessed recently at a West Berlin 
intersection, a West German driver gradually became so enraged at the hesitancy 
of the East German car ahead of him that he first shouted uncontrollably, then 
leaped out to accost the offending individual. 
</P>
<P>
Only then did the East German car trundle off, leaving the Western driver alone 
in a cloud of exhaust fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Other more overt, more worrisome differences are easier to spot. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 40 years of one-party dictatorship has left East Germans often 
ill-prepared for the lively exchange of political views that has been a part of 
the West German public discourse for a similar period. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Cabinet ministers, including West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and De Maiziere, have been pelted with eggs and rotten fruit as 
they tried to address East German crowds, and an information stand erected in 
East Berlin by the right-wing Republican Party was attacked by East German 
street toughs. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take years for any real political normalization in the sense of a 
democratic recovery to take place," Bonn University historian Karl Dieter 
Bracher said. 
</P>
<P>
Bracher and others worry about the lingering legacy of the East German Ministry 
for State Security -- known as the Stasi -- whose tentacles reached so deeply 
into society that an estimated two-thirds of the country's population was 
touched by its actions, either as victim or as accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, former East German Foreign Minister Markus 
Meckel counted this legacy as the most difficult of all burdens East Germans 
collectively carry to unification. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever we are, whenever we apply for any job in the future, the question will 
always be there for the employer: 'Was he or wasn't he?' " Meckel, a Protestant 
pastor, said. "That will always separate us from West Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Bracher said: "In 10, 20 years, the Stasi files will still play a role, either 
in political mudslinging or in the threat of blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
Some worry also that simple ignorance of the differences that separate the two 
German people could bring the seeds of future social problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Way Interest 
</P>
<P>
Although most East Germans have watched West German television for years and 
have used their newly won freedom to visit West Germany in recent months, the 
level of knowledge and interest is far lower in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Most West Germans know little or nothing about East Germany and seem to feel 
no need to know," noted Monika Zimmermann, a West German journalist who 
recently was named editor of the East Berlin daily Neue Zeit. "Soon, it (East 
Germany) will disappear, and the chance to understand will go with it." 
</P>
<P>
A recent series about East Germany in the West German daily Frankfurter 
Allegemeine Zeitung ran under the title: "The Unknown Country -- Insights Into 
the German Democratic Republic." 
</P>
<P>
West German President Richard von Weizsaecker recently warned a national 
television audience of the depth of the problem facing the united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everything (dealing with unification) is answered with material 
questions," he said. "Along with the economic and currency union, the social 
and political union, we've got to achieve a union of consciousnesses -- to 
enter into a union of feelings -- and that means we have to open ourselves up 
to each other. It is a process that demands time, one that just can't simply 
follow legal rules." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the differences, however, many believe that enough similarities 
remain among the Germans in terms of language, heritage and identity to 
eventually overcome the years of separation and forge a common Volk. 
</P>
<P>
"National character is often underrated," Noelle-Neumann said, "and the 
national character linking East and West Germans is so strong that it can 
overcome a lot."

BRADY SEEKS $25 BILLION IN ALLIED AID 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration began asking its major economic allies Tuesday for at 
least $25 billion to help defray America's military expenses in the Persian 
Gulf and to aid countries that have been hit hard by the global trade embargo 
on Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On orders from President Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady led a 
delegation of top officials on a whirlwind tour to meet with leaders of France, 
Britain, South Korea and Japan to discuss the U.S. request. He is scheduled to 
return early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Brady told reporters that the Administration has developed specific targets for 
each nation and expects to begin negotiations during the remainder of this 
week. "What we have to do is compare notes," he said. "We will have an outline 
on the numbers by the time we come back." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the Administration request contained two basic elements: 
</P>
<P>
* Washington wants the allies to pay $15 billion between now and the end of 
1990 to help cover the "incremental costs" -- mainly transportation and airlift 
expenses -- for the massive U.S. troop buildup in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
* It also is seeking at least $10 billion by the end of 1991 to help bolster 
the economies of the so-called front-line states, such as Egypt, Turkey and 
Jordan, that have been hit the hardest by the trade embargo imposed after 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials cautioned that the figures are likely to fluctuate, 
depending on oil prices and the military situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's decision to make an overt, worldwide plea for cash has 
sparked a heated controversy both at home and abroad. Critics say the move 
makes it appear that U.S. soldiers are being used as mercenaries for the 
benefit of Japan and other allies. 
</P>
<P>
But top Administration officials argue that Washington is just trying to 
establish machinery for "burden-sharing" under which other nations contribute 
to support the international enforcement action. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought is that we have the diplomatic and military pieces of our strategy 
well in place, and now what needs to be put in place is an economic piece, 
which will fill out the three branches of our strategy," Brady told reporters 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brady began his tour in Paris Tuesday with a meeting with French Budget 
Minister Pierre Beregovoy and Foreign Affairs Minister Roland Dumas, but 
neither side would elaborate on what, if anything, France had agreed to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
After the Paris meeting, a U.S. official said that the American and French 
officials did discuss "overall numbers" for French assistance. But he refused 
to provide further details. Brady later flew to London for a session with 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, the richest of the nations on Brady's itinerary, last week became the 
first ally to make a specific pledge of financial assistance when it said it 
would provide at least $1 billion. However, U.S. officials said privately that 
they were disappointed by the size of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Brady told reporters Tuesday that he is optimistic about the response that the 
U.S. request for money is likely to receive. He said Bush has already spoken to 
the leaders of each of the countries he plans to visit and each signaled a 
willingness to be "very forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
"I think these meetings will be most successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the week, Brady plans to meet with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo 
in Seoul and, finally, with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Tokyo 
before returning to Washington on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say Washington first wants to organize its allies to 
provide short-term assistance for the front-line states in the Middle East and 
later may ask the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to coordinate 
long-term aid to the region. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the United States must take the lead in spurring its allies to 
develop an international aid package for the region. "This will take some 
leadership so that there is no more loss of time" in providing assistance, one 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady told reporters that he was pleased by the French response. "We had a very 
successful meeting, we were very pleased . . . that Minister Dumas felt in the 
same way that we do" about the need to back up Western efforts with economic 
support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, however, would say only that the two sides had a "very constructive 
discussion" and refused to elaborate on whether France was prepared to commit 
any funds to the American effort in the Persian Gulf.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The candidates for governor dived into the highly partisan debate over the 
state budget Tuesday, with GOP nominee Pete Wilson announcing he would oppose 
any new taxes unless they were accompanied by a bipartisan reform of state 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic candidate Dianne Feinstein, meanwhile, defended state spending for 
education and took issue with Wilson's position that fiscal reform could 
require cuts in money directed to schools. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning separately in the state capital, both candidates hewed closely to 
party lines in defining their priorities in the tight fiscal atmosphere in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, speaking to several hundred guests at a meeting of the Comstock Club, 
echoed Gov. George Deukmejian's frequently voiced frustration that most of the 
state's spending is mandated by statutes, legal decisions and the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Wilson drew his fiscal line in the sand in what seemed to be an 
impossible location with his pledge to hold off any discussion of new taxes 
unless there is budget reform. 
</P>
<P>
"There (should be) no talk of new taxes until there has been achieved what 
should in fact first occur -- basic budget reform, fundamental restructuring of 
the state budget," Wilson said, adding that his goal is to allow both the 
governor and the Legislature more flexibility to assert their priorities. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the current restrictions can only be lifted with voter approval, 
which Wilson acknowledged could not be achieved until 1992 at the earliest, two 
budget cycles from now. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later whether it was possible to delay discussion of new taxes until 
reform was accomplished, Wilson said he would meet with legislative leaders 
immediately after the election to begin "building a consensus." 
</P>
<P>
"That is a precondition to any discussion of new taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the gubernatorial candidates has ruled out new taxes as a way of 
dealing with what is expected to be a deficit next year. On Monday, however, 
Wilson did rule out any increase in income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Wilson criticized the impact of Proposition 98, the 1988 voter 
initiative that guarantees that more than 40% of the general fund budget will 
be set aside for education spending. 
</P>
<P>
While "education is a priority," Wilson said, "we may very well shift some 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein on Tuesday flatly refused to sanction any change in the education 
funding equation. She called such spending "absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"We're slipping with our skilled work force and we need to regain that slippage 
and the only way to do it is by saying, 'Look, this is a priority,' " she told 
reporters after touring a California Highway Patrol academy. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson, Feinstein declined to say where she would cut government spending. 
Also, neither of the candidates has listed where they would get the money for 
most of the programs they have floated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to have to take a good look at the budget and see what we 
can do to be sure the taxpayers are getting as much bang for their taxpayer 
dollar as possible, and do some things on both the expenditure side and the 
revenue side to keep it in balance," Feinstein said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wilson continued to focus his verbal firepower on Feinstein. He 
followed up his Monday criticism of her stands on crime by portraying her as a 
"taxer" and "spender." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson ticked off a list of taxes he said she endorsed during her tenure as 
mayor of San Francisco. According to his campaign, per capita taxes in San 
Francisco rose 34% during Feinstein's tenure, but in San Diego during Wilson's 
term as mayor, taxes dropped almost 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"The past is prologue to the future," Wilson said. "Dianne Feinstein has never 
met a tax she didn't like -- or want to hike." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has said that she came into office facing a deficit and had to deal 
with an aging city infrastructure as well as an expanding AIDS crisis. She has 
also pointed out that she took office in the post-Proposition 13 era. More than 
half of Wilson's term, she said, occurred before that voter initiative slashed 
money going to local government. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign manager, Bill Carrick, also said Tuesday that because San 
Francisco is both a city and a county, it has broader responsibilities than a 
city alone. "She did what she had to do to meet her responsibilities," Carrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Wilson's effort, some similarities between the two candidates were 
visible Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson, Feinstein has complained about the automatic nature of much of the 
state's spending. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, in a debate with Democratic contender John K. Van de Kamp, 
the state attorney general, Feinstein said that as governor she would place all 
state programs on the table when trying to work out a budget compromise. Wilson 
has said essentially the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Both Feinstein and Wilson have said they would try to protect cost-of-living 
increases for stipends for the poor, the elderly and the ill. And both 
supported the recently approved increase in the state's gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has advocated extending the 0.25% increase in the state's sales tax, 
originally imposed as a temporary measure to pay for damages caused by the Oct. 
17 Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
She has also left open the possibility of adjusting income tax brackets to come 
up with additional state revenue, a suggestion that Wilson on Tuesday derided 
as "a fancy phrase for raising income taxes."

CAR USED IN KIDNAPING OF 3 RECOVERED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: POLICE HAVE LITTLE ELSE TO GO ON IN THE RAPE OF THE VICTIMS AND THE 
DEATH OF ONE GIRL, 15.

Ontario police investigators inched forward Tuesday in their hunt for three men 
in a grisly weekend kidnaping that left one teen-age girl dead and two other 
women raped and stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
A car used in the abduction was recovered Tuesday afternoon abandoned in the 
community of Rubidoux, near Riverside, but detectives said their investigation, 
including interviews with the surviving victims, had produced little useful 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have much of anything at this point," Detective Mike Cormican said. 
"It's very vague." 
</P>
<P>
Cormican said police "are not ruling out the possibility that this was a 
gang-related crime," but declined to elaborate on a connection. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the homicide victim as Yvette Woodruff, 15, of Ontario. 
The San Bernardino County coroner's office said she was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Cormican said that Woodruff, a girlfriend and the friend's mother were abducted 
by three men in their 20s as they arrived at a home in the 200 block of North 
Campus Avenue about 2:15 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The three apparently committed a robbery inside the home and then kidnaped the 
women at gunpoint, fleeing in a car driven by one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Cormican said the women were taken to a field near an industrial area on the 
city's isolated eastern edge. There, the three were raped, Woodruff was shot 
and the two other women were stabbed before their attackers drove off, Cormican 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors walked half a mile to a pay phone and summoned police, but 
Woodruff was dead when authorities arrived at the scene shortly after 4:30 
a.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The older woman was hospitalized with multiple stab wounds, and her daughter 
was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The episode -- which was the third kidnaping and homicide in Ontario this 
summer -- has left the city jittery. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe they are related, but unfortunately we've had a string of 
these come up this year," Cormican said. "It's an unusual and unpleasant thing 
for Ontario." 
</P>
<P>
The unsettling series began on June 2 when Herbert Farley, 65, was abducted 
from behind a grocery store after his wife, Lula, 71, was shot and killed in 
the parking lot. Police found Herbert Farley's bullet-riddled body two weeks 
later. A suspect, Steven Valdez, 19, of Ontario was arrested in July. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a mentally disabled woman was kidnaped from her Ontario home. 
Antonette Mena, 21, was found strangled in the Mt. Baldy area soon after, and 
two suspects have been arrested.

JOURNEY OVER, SOLAR PLANE TAKES ITS PLACE IN THE SUN 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside County man concluded history's first coast-to-coast flight in a 
solar-powered airplane here Tuesday, abandoning plans to fly nine more miles to 
his original destination because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Raymond, 33, said winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. persuaded him to scrub the 
last leg of his journey and instead take his plane by trailer to historic Kill 
Devil Hills, the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk where Orville and Wilbur Wright 
pioneered engine-powered aviation 87 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I landed basically at the beach yesterday," Raymond said Tuesday, one month 
and two days after his transcontinental trek began in the California desert. 
"With the forecast for winds and storms, it doesn't look like it is worth 
flying the last nine miles." 
</P>
<P>
Including Monday's 32-mile flight to Spot, where a storm forced him to land on 
a farmer's turf field, Raymond logged 2,467 miles during 119 hours and 23 
minutes in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those unofficial figures easily make Raymond -- a national hang-gliding 
champion from Lake Elsinore -- a world record holder in solar-powered aviation. 
The longest previous flight -- in a craft designed by Paul MacCready of 
Pasadena -- was across the English Channel in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, a lithe, bespectacled fellow, said he is not interested in records or 
recognition. He said his mission was to enlighten people about the potential of 
traveling with the help of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Solar is already quite practical for sporting aircraft," said Raymond, who 
built his 195-pound plane called Sun-Seeker, which resembles a giant dragonfly, 
in his garage. "Eventually, if the technology keeps improving . . . you will 
start seeing bigger and bigger and faster airplanes that are solar-powered." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of tourists, reporters and local aviators gathered at historic Kill 
Devil Hills on Monday and Tuesday, anticipating the pilot's arrival. Some were 
disappointed when they learned Sun-Seeker would not be landing amid the 
rippling sea oats surrounding First Flight Airport, but most seemed impressed 
by Raymond's feat. 
</P>
<P>
"What Eric has done is an example of creative engineering," said Gene 
O'Bleness, executive director of the First Flight Society, a group of pilots 
and aviation history buffs. His group, along with the Kitty Hawk Kites, held a 
cake-and-champagne reception for Raymond on Tuesday night and presented him 
with a leather bomber jacket with "Sun-Seeker" embroidered on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's journey began in the desert east of Palm Springs on July 16. Two days 
later, Sun-Seeker -- which uses solar cells to power an electric motor used 
during takeoffs and landings -- was damaged in Lordsburg, N.M., forcing the 
crew to return to Lake Elsinore for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The flight recommenced Aug. 2, and Raymond hoped to reach Kitty Hawk in 10 
days. Poor flying conditions -- ranging from thunderstorms to head winds that 
at times blew the feather-light craft backward -- slowed the pilot's progress. 
The plane was grounded by foul weather on 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the thrill of the journey, with its potpourri of sights and encounters, 
overshadowed frustrations caused by the sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to fly across the country," Raymond said, recalling how the panorama 
changed gradually from desert to woods to farmland and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avoid big cities with crowded skies, Raymond plotted a southerly 
course that took him through some of America's most lonely reaches. Among the 
crew's nighttime stopovers were such places as Cornudas, Tex., Chanute, Kan., 
Sedalia, Mo., and West Liberty, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The townsfolk and airport operators, Raymond said, were wonderfully hospitable. 
In Littlefield, Tex., the ground crew following Raymond accidentally wrecked 
the trailer needed to haul Sun-Seeker back to California. The local Chamber of 
Commerce president sent a team of mechanics to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking, 'Oh boy, what is this going to cost?' " recalled Raymond's 
wife, Aida, who followed her husband across the country in a chase plane. The 
local official, a glider pilot, refused to accept any money for the work. 
</P>
<P>
After resuming the trip, stiff winds and weak thermals -- the updrafts of warm 
air that lift Sun-Seeker to soaring altitude -- forced back-to-back landings in 
grassy fields in Missouri. The plane, made mostly of carbon fiber, suffered 
only minor damage to one wing that struck a bush. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond spent the long hours in his tiny cockpit -- which measures only 21 
inches wide -- reading maps, lunching on the fruit and cookies his wife packed 
each day and maneuvering his craft in the wind. The only discomfort was the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an air vent, but I close it when I'm trying to make the most distance," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A sportsman at heart, Raymond took advantage of the fierce winds Tuesday and 
went sail boarding. After returning home, he plans to start on his next 
project: a solar-powered dirigible capable of flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from Riverside and Stanley reported from North Carolina.

SERVICEMAN'S MOTHER SEEKS SUPPORT GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diana Contatore of Playa del Rey, whose Army son is scheduled for deployment to 
the Middle East, is looking for mothers of other deployed servicemen and women 
who might be interested in forming a support group. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are other mothers out there who think it might be helpful to trade 
information, maybe work to drum up people to be supportive and send cards, just 
anything, I'd like to do that," said Contatore. "Maybe we can give each other 
comfort." 
</P>
<P>
Contatore's son, Army 2nd Lt. Daniel Kral, is at Ft. Hood, Tex., awaiting 
deployment. Contatore asks that people interested in a support group call her 
at (213) 937-0916 or 937-0917.

The show had ended and as Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca walked by a group of 
die-hard fans, a woman in her 40s confessed, "The worst punishment as a kid was 
not being able to watch Sid and Imogene on Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 years later, "Your Show of Shows" still elicits fond memories from 
the legions who watched the 90-minute comedy revue on NBC. And its two stars 
still bring cheers. 
</P>
<P>
During two shows Monday at the Seattle Center's Opera House as part of the 
annual Bumbershoot art and music festival, Caesar and Coca received standing 
ovations as they took the stage to perform a new 90-minute act. 
</P>
<P>
"They are turning out to be the cult act of Bumbershoot," said Lauri Jacoby, 
the festival's booking director. 
</P>
<P>
Their sketches, pantomimes and routines included some new material, but most of 
it was adapted from "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour," the variety show 
that Caesar hosted following the cancellation of "Your Show of Shows" in 1954. 
One skit had them dueling with raised eyebrows and forefingers as "Man and Wife 
in Argument," set to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
For Rosemarie Lippert, 78, and her daughter, Barbara, 45, Caesar and Coca were 
a "must see" at the festival, whose other nationally known names included 
writers Ann Waldman and Tom Robbins, the Marsha Threlkeld Dance Troupe, Emmylou 
Harris, Ry Cooder, Buckwheat Zydeco, Albert King, Fats Domino, Leon Redbone, 
Ziggy Marley, Michelle Shocked and the Righteous Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows when we would be able to see them again?" Barbara said. 
</P>
<P>
If Caesar, who turns 68 on Saturday, and Coca, 82, have their way, their 
longtime fans and potential new ones may have many more opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
They've already played New York and Atlantic City, and now are heading for an 
open-ended engagement in Chicago, with Los Angeles a possibility beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"How long do I want to do this?" Caesar pondered the question during an 
interview here, and a smile quickly emerged. "I make good money, work with nice 
people, and I'm able to do what I want to do. Are you crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Coca looked around for wood on which to knock. "This is great. I'd like to do 
this for a long time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two got back together last spring after Caesar did a four-month stretch in 
a small off-Broadway club in New York and then a two-week stint on Broadway. He 
called to see what Coca was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The time was right," Caesar said simply. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked into Michael's Pub, the club where Woody Allen plays his 
clarinet Monday nights. The date was open-ended. "We played for four months, 
five days a week, with a couple shows on the weekend," Coca said. "I loved that 
club. I could have gone on forever." 
</P>
<P>
It's still a wonder to her why "Your Show of Shows" was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Both Caesar and Coca were given their own shows. Coca's lasted only six months. 
"Caesar's Hour" lasted three years. 
</P>
<P>
For Caesar, still muscular thanks to a strict daily exercise regimen that 
includes dozens of sit-ups and push-ups, a 90-minute walk and a 20-lap swim, 
NBC's decision remains a bitter memory. 
</P>
<P>
"They figured they could make more money by breaking us up. It's called greed," 
he said. "They have no understanding of chemistry. They know names, they know 
agents. But you can have the best writers, actors and producers (and) without 
chemistry you can have a flop. The business people upstairs don't understand 
that." 
</P>
<P>
After the demise of "Caesar's Hour," Caesar hit an extended dark period filled 
with drugs and alcohol. In his 1982 book, "Where Have I Been?," he talks of 
days and weeks erased from his memory. Some associates laid the blame on too 
much success too soon. Caesar became a Comedy King at 26. 
</P>
<P>
His advice for young talent on the rise? "There's no warning before the big 
fall," he said. "It's a matter of self-control. Knowing you don't know it all. 
Success is new to them. Treat it as something that can easily go away. Enjoy 
it, but don't delve into it."

HOLLYWOOD'S SUMMER OF LOVE; 
</P>
<P>
ROMANTIC 'GHOST' OUTGUNS MACHO MOVIES TO BECOME SEASON'S BIGGEST HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the summer when more people went to see Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze 
than Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy, when moviegoers finally seemed to weary of 
car crashes, explosions and automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's macho summer ended with an old-fashioned message: America still 
loves a love story. In a season when nearly all the major movies were 
big-budget action pictures aimed at young men, the surprise success was a 
relatively modest ($22-million budget) love story that offered one of the few 
prominent roles for a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost," an uplifting tribute to yuppie love starring Moore and Swayze, opened 
second to "Die Hard 2" and steadily built up word-of-mouth to become the top 
film of the summer, with $125 million in ticket sales through Labor Day. 
Paramount Pictures poured hundreds of millions of dollars into hardware movies 
this summer, but it was "Ghost" that gave the studio a strong edge over much of 
its competition. 
</P>
<P>
If tickets sales from another love story, "Pretty Woman" -- actually a spring 
release -- are factored in, Disney was the top-earning studio over the summer, 
according to Paul Kagan Associates. Produced for a modest $12 million, this 
Pygmalion tale -- Henry Higgins takes home a hooker -- had grossed $169 million 
through Labor Day, according to the studio. It also returned Richard Gere to 
stardom and made co-star Julia Roberts one of the most sought-after actresses 
in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Disney also was helped by the success of "Dick Tracy," Warren Beatty's comic 
book epic. The No. 4 film of the summer, "Dick Tracy" faced some tough odds 
given that young people were not familiar with either Beatty or the character. 
But a massive marketing blitz and generally good reviews pushed ticket sales to 
$103.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, moviegoing was off 5% from last year's record summer, according to 
projections by Paul Kagan Associates. The firm projects that total box-office 
receipts will top $1.92 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably hurt that there were so many of the same pictures at the same 
time," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which compiles 
box-office figures. "There wasn't the diversity there was in previous years." 
</P>
<P>
The list of the top 10 movies for the summer, as expected, was filled out by 
action-adventure films. But many of the films failed to meet expectations set 
by last year's adventure blockbusters: "Batman," "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2." 
</P>
<P>
The summer's results could challenge the popular notion in Hollywood that big 
stars plus big budgets guarantee big returns at the box office. Analysts say 
that none of this summer's major movies will lose money -- video, TV and 
foreign markets will make up for any shortfall at U.S. theaters -- but many 
industry insiders are predicting that it's just a matter of time before a 
Hollywood studio runs into a high-tech "Heaven's Gate," the 1980 spectacle that 
nearly destroyed United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying the budgets have gotten out of hand," said Elizabeth A. 
Cameron, research associate at Smith Barney, a New York brokerage firm. "I 
think the companies are going to scale back . . . There's this perception that 
you have to spend $60 million for a movie and that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Cameron said that business at the box office also was hurt by a slowing economy 
and rising ticket prices. In addition, she said, the time window between 
theater and video releases closed dramatically. As a result, she said, with 
ticket prices reaching $7.50 at some New York and L.A. theaters, young 
theatergoers are choosing to wait until their favorite movies come out on 
video, rather than standing in line for a second viewing at theaters. Sales of 
videos were up substantially this summer, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
In the body-count sweepstakes, "Total Recall" -- director Paul Verhoeven's 
complex science-fiction thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger -- was the 
clear winner. With a budget that stretched beyond $60 million, the Carolco 
production, distributed by Tri-Star, came in second place for the summer with 
ticket sales of $116.7 million. Given Schwarzenegger's popularity in foreign 
markets, many analysts expect the film to match that figure overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The other action picture with the summer's biggest budget, 20th Century Fox's 
"Die Hard 2" (industry estimates put the production costs above $62 million) 
came in third place with more than $109.7 million in ticket sales. The sequel 
to "Die Hard," (1988's sleeper summer hit), exceeded the original's ticket 
sales by more than 35%. But overall this was not a kind summer for sequels. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Eddie Murphy's name on a summer movie has guaranteed 
$100-million-plus in ticket sales. But Paramount's "Another 48 HRS.," a sequel 
to the buddy-cop picture that originally launched Murphy to stardom, had ticket 
sales of $79.1 million and was rapped by critics for excessive violence and 
insufficient plot. Although that ticket-sale figure is large -- and slightly 
exceeds sales on the original -- it fell far short of expectations for a film 
that cost at least $45 million to make. 
</P>
<P>
Other sequels that failed to meet expectations were Universal's "Back to the 
Future III," ($84.1 million, in contrast to $208 million for the original, one 
of the 10 top films of all time); Orion's "RoboCop 2," ($44.8 million, compared 
to $54 million for the original in 1987); and Warner Bros.' "Gremlins 2: The 
New Batch" ($40.4 million compared to $148 million for the original, one of the 
top five releases in 1984). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cruise's ode to stock car racing, "Days of Thunder," was considered by many 
an earthbound sequel to the 1985 jet fighter hit, "Top Gun" (one critic even 
charted the plot similarities). The Paramount film cost at least $50 million to 
make and grossed $80.6 million -- a figure that has to be split roughly 50-50 
between theater owners and the studio. In contrast, "Top Gun" grossed $177 
million.

FRIENDS HELPING WELLS FACE THE STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE FORMER MOTOWN STAR IS FIGHTING THROAT CANCER AND A SLIDE INTO 
POVERTY. COLLEAGUES ARE RALLYING BEHIND HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Mary Wells, best known for such exhilarating '60s Motown hits as "My 
Guy" and "The One Who Really Loves You," was seething with frustration because 
she's having trouble getting her point across -- once again. 
</P>
<P>
Communicating is now difficult for the veteran performer because a recent 
tracheotomy robbed her -- at least temporarily -- of her power of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was done last month, when doctors determined that Wells, who'd 
been having throat discomfort for months, has cancer -- a tumor in her larynx. 
It's unlikely she'll ever sing again professionally. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the 47-year-old singer either writes her thoughts on paper or 
mouths words, requiring others to read her lips -- which is difficult for the 
inexperienced and woefully frustrating for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Mouthing her words, Wells, currently residing in a downtown Los Angeles hotel, 
said Monday, "I can't get used to this. You can't imagine how hard this is for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to such striking hits as "My Guy" and "You Beat Me to the Punch," Wells 
was one of Motown's key early stars. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Temptations, the Supremes, the Miracles and the Marvelettes, the 
Detroit native helped define the label's pop-R&amp;B sound. After her heyday 
she parlayed those hits into a career mostly on the oldies circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Though far from rich, Wells was living comfortably this year in a three-bedroom 
Van Nuys townhouse with Curtis Womack, brother of singer-songwriter Bobby 
Womack and father of her 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
But when her throat started to go bad a few months ago, her life fell apart. No 
longer able to do concerts, Wells found her income drying up. The same with her 
savings. She and Womack subsequently broke up. Last month, while Wells was in 
the hospital, her landlord evicted her for nonpayment of rent, she indicated. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. 
</P>
<P>
Wells has no health insurance to help pay the mounting medical bills. She 
alerted her friend Joyce McRae, a trustee of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 
Washington, D.C., whose many functions include helping struggling musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out about Mary's illness while she was still in the hospital," said 
McRae, who was with Wells during the interview. "I called everybody in the 
media I could think of to put the word out that Mary needed financial help." 
</P>
<P>
So far there have been contributions from Diana Ross ($15,000), Rod Stewart 
($10,000), Bruce Springsteen ($10,000) and the Temptations ($5,000). All have 
been sent to the foundation, specifically earmarked for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Wells has even received a pledge of future support from Berry Gordy, the 
founder of Motown. Like many veteran Motown singers, Wells reportedly hadn't 
been on good terms with Gordy for years. But when ex-Supreme Mary Wilson, who 
also has had battles with Gordy, contacted him, Gordy promised to help 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd do whatever he could to help Mary," Wilson said in a separate 
interview. "That's good of him because he's under no obligation to her." 
</P>
<P>
Wells looked healthy and robust during the interview. If she didn't have the 
tube in her throat, you wouldn't suspect anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the frustration about communication, she also seemed to be in an 
upbeat mood. 
</P>
<P>
The singer started an intensive six-week radiation treatment plan last week at 
the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital at USC. 
</P>
<P>
If treatment is successful, she may be able to avoid having her larynx removed. 
Currently, she and her daughter are residing in the hotel, which is 10 minutes 
away from the center. 
</P>
<P>
It's not clear how much money Wells will need. "Medical and housing expenses 
will be high," McRae said. "Mary can't work now. A lot of veteran R&amp;B 
musicians like her live from day to day. When they get ill, they can't work and 
they have no income." 
</P>
<P>
Wells has recorded for various record companies since leaving Motown, but with 
little commercial success. Her last album, recorded in 1988, was released only 
in England. She recorded her last major U.S. album for Epic Records in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sad ironies of Wells' situation is that the veteran singer was on 
the verge of making a record that might have revived her recording career. The 
singer said she'd been contacted by Springsteen to sing a duet with him on the 
album he's currently recording here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the financial and emotional support that came immediately from her 
colleagues has altered her negative opinion of a business she often feels used 
her up and cast her aside. 
</P>
<P>
"People say this is a cruel business -- and it is," she said, again mouthing 
the words. "But a lot of people in the business do have hearts."

HOLMES A COURT FAMILY KEEPING U.K. THEATERS; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: DESPITE ANNOUNCEMENT, SPECULATION GROWS ABOUT FATE OF 13 HIGHLY PRIZED 
WEST END PROPERTIES.

<P>
The group of 13 West End theaters left by Australian businessman Robert Holmes 
a Court -- including the Theater Royal Drury Lane, where the smash musical 
"Miss Saigon" is running -- will remain under family control, his company said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the announcement, speculation continued here over the future of the 
group, Stoll Moss Theaters, which owns about 25% of the commercial stages in 
London's "theaterland." 
</P>
<P>
The theaters are part of the widespread holdings of Holmes a Court, who died 
early Sunday of a heart attack at his home in Australia. His widow, Janet, and 
oldest son, Peter, will now become the major shareholders in the family 
company, Heytesbury Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have been swirling through London's theater world that one or another of 
Holmes a Court's rivals might swoop in to grab some of his historic West End 
jewels. Louis Benjamin, former president of Stoll Moss, told Britain's Daily 
Telegraph that within hours of hearing that Holmes a Court had died, he had 
been asked to join two separate consortiums that wanted to buy the theater 
group. He would not name them, but said one was British and the other American. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been speculation that members of Holmes a Court's management 
team might attempt a buyout. Besides owning the Drury Lane, the West End's 
largest commercial theater, Stoll Moss holdings include the legendary 
Palladium, where "Show Boat" is having a successful run, and Her Majesty's, 
where "The Phantom of the Opera" is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
While neither Heytesbury nor Stoll Moss would place a value on the theater 
group, outside estimates have run between $117 million and $146 million. 
</P>
<P>
David Kiernan, finance director of Chesterfield Properties, which owns six West 
End theaters, said he did not have "the faintest" idea what the Stoll Moss 
group might be worth, but added that $146 million "seems like a lot to me." But 
he, along with other industry observers, agreed that ownership of certain 
theaters carries great prestige and could boost the value in unpredictable 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like owning certain prestige hotels, such as the Dorchester or the Ritz," 
said Rebecca Munns, an analyst with W.I. Carr in London. 
</P>
<P>
Chesterfield has made no moves toward attempting to buy the Stoll Moss 
theaters, Kiernan said. But the company might be interested in buying pieces of 
the collection if they were to be sold individually. 
</P>
<P>
"It would depend on which ones and how much they were asking," Kiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Munns, "One wonders whether (composer Andrew) Lloyd Webber might be 
interested in owning more theaters." 
</P>
<P>
The business relationship between Lloyd Webber and Holmes a Court had not been 
pleasant. Earlier this year, at a time when the composer was trying to buy back 
shares to take his company private, the Australian had increased his holdings 
in Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group to 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely assumed in the West End that Holmes a Court purchased his minority 
stake in RUG with plans to force Lloyd Webber to sell him the spectacular 
Palace theater, where "Les Miserables" is running. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes a Court's Heytesbury company said it still has no plans to sell its RUG 
holdings. A spokesman for the Really Useful Group said Tuesday that Lloyd 
Webber is still interested in buying back the shares and will probably take 
some action soon. 
</P>
<P>
Theater owners earn most of their income by splitting ticket sales with 
producers; in most cases the producer gets 60% with the theater owner getting 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll Moss itself, however, had recently begun investing in some shows and 
therefore began taking a larger percentage of the box office, said Peter 
Hepple, editor of the London trade paper The Stage. "They sometimes get a 50-50 
split or even 40-60," he said.

SAN FRANCISCO OPERA CANCELS ITS OPENING WEEKEND; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: FAILED CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS FORCE THE FIRST CANCELLATION IN THE 
COMPANY'S 67-YEAR HISTORY.

<P>
San Francisco Opera executives announced Tuesday that they have canceled 
opening weekend performances scheduled to begin Friday, citing failed labor 
negotiations with its musicians. No new talks have been scheduled, and opera 
executives said they did not know when performances of the 23-week opera season 
would begin. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference on the opera house stage, General Director Lotfi Mansouri 
called the decision to cancel the opening performances for the first time in 
the company's 67-year history "excruciatingly difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Talks between opera management and members of the opera orchestra broke down on 
Sunday after musicians rejected an offer that would have given them a 12% pay 
increase over the three-year contract term. Musicians have sought a 22.5% 
salary increase over three years. That would bring their pay, which is about 
$40,000 now, to $49,000 at the end of the three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Opera executives insist they would be forced into closing the company to meet 
the union's demand. They maintain that musicians are among the highest paid in 
the nation. When benefits are added to the actual salary, musicians would be 
making $75,000 a year by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely the core issue," said Tully Friedman, past president of the 
opera. He maintains that the company would be forced into closing. "We are at 
the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman also raised the possibility that the opera board will consider 
canceling the entire season if the dispute goes on for another two to four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful we can still save the season, but we need a management that will 
negotiate," said Joanne Eisler, a clarinetist for the San Francisco Opera for 
the past 10 years and the chairwoman of the negotiating committee for Local 6 
of the American Federation of Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to end the deadlock, musicians called on San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos 
to mediate the dispute. So far, however, he has not entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-member orchestra's contract expired on Aug. 19, and opera management 
locked out the musicians preventing them from rehearsing at the opera house. 
They have, however, been rehearsing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Union leader Eisler said talks broke down on Sunday after management suggested 
that musicians take a $3,200 pay cut to compensate for work they have missed 
during the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Eisler estimated that San Francisco opera musicians' pay is $20 an hour below 
pay for other musicians in comparable orchestras.

A PEEK INTO LYNCH'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A vocalist wearing a prom dress sings eerie ballads while suspended in midair. 
A topless nymph slithers up the back of an abandoned car, crawling in a space 
that's normally a back window. Standing next to a clarinet player and a young 
woman writhing in ecstasy, a midget repeats an early, heart-breaking dialogue 
between a man and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to director David Lynch's nightmare world. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrial Symphony No. 1," a 50-minute home video that was released this week 
(on Warner Reprise, $19.98), is a fascinating, constantly intriguing stroll 
through a dark, bleak, surrealistic landscape, resembling what a city might 
look like after a nuclear war -- one big industrial junkyard. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is smoky and lit by flashing searchlights. All the vocals are 
performed by Julee Cruise, who has a high, frail, angelic voice and an 
ethereal, jazzy vocal style. Her dream-like songs, such as "Up in Flames" and 
"I Float Alone," provide a chilling contrast to the string of stark, menacing 
images. 
</P>
<P>
In Lynch's world, the bizarre seems normal. So when a squadron of dolls slowly 
descends into a frantic crowd, it seems like business as usual. You never quite 
know what's going on, but that's obviously what Lynch intended. 
</P>
<P>
It starts off with a short phone conversation between a couple (played by Laura 
Dern and Nicolas Cage, who star in Lynch's movie "Wild at Heart") on the verge 
of breaking up. The succeeding images seem to reflect their turmoil and 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, who writes the music for Lynch's "Twin Peaks" TV 
series, composed a slow, spare, moody, jazz-oriented score -- part instrumental 
and part vocals -- that enhances the pervasive, nightmarish mood. Though it 
looks as if it had been shot on a sound stage using elaborate cinematic special 
effects, this program was filmed last November during a live performance at the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is a Lynch project, "Twin Peaks" fans might be tempted to sample 
it. But this wildly unorthodox program is less for that audience than it is for 
fans of the far-out -- for instance, those who love Lynch's outrageous "Wild at 
Heart."

2 CANDIDATES IN NEVADA HURT IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada voters went to the polls Tuesday in a primary election marred by a light 
plane crash that seriously injured two statewide candidates and killed the wife 
of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidates Sue Wagner, running for lieutenant governor, and Bob 
Seale, running for state treasurer, were hurt when the plane Seale was piloting 
developed engine trouble and crashed just after taking off Monday from the 
Fallon airport, 50 miles east of Reno, on a campaign swing. 
</P>
<P>
Seale's wife, Judy, who was serving as his co-pilot, was killed, and two 
campaign aides suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wagner, a state senator, and Seale, a public accountant, were listed in 
fair condition Tuesday at a hospital in Reno. Their doctor said both had been 
able to vote by absentee ballot. Both had opponents on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In other primary races, Democratic Gov. Bob Miller was heavily favored to win 
nomination over five relatively unknown challengers in his party, and newcomer 
Jim Gallaway, a businessman and the heaviest spender, was favored among eight 
Republican contenders. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old governor has held the job for two years, since Democrat Dick 
Bryan gave up the job upon election to the U.S. Senate. One of the challengers 
in the Democratic primary, in an attempt to garner voter attention, changed his 
legal name to Rhinestone Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
Gallaway, in his campaign, emphasized his stand in favor of abortion rights, 
which Miller opposes, and has opposed a statewide payroll tax plan that Miller 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent poll indicated Miller would go into the general election campaign, 
if both men were nominated, with a 2-to-1 lead, 60% to 27%, with the rest 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500,000 people were eligible to vote in the fast-growing state, but 
election authorities predicted a turnout of only 35% to 40%. Registered 
Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans in Nevada, and both U.S. senators, as 
well as the governor, are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the hottest contest was in the Democratic primary for attorney general, 
where Nevada Secretary of State Frankie Sue Del Papa was seeking to move up. 
Her principal opponent was a former Las Vegas judge, Leonard Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Gang pointed out late in the campaign that Del Papa is ineligible to practice 
law in Nevada, but Del Papa, who had practiced law for 16 years before assuming 
an inactive status, responded that, under state law, she could return to active 
status simply by paying $126 in fees and completing a 10-hour legal refresher 
course. This, she said, would be a mere matter of a weekend's study. 
</P>
<P>
The contenders in the Republican attorney general's primary were Bryan Nelson, 
a former chief deputy state attorney general, and Randy Rumph, an attorney for 
Bally's hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
In a legislative contest, the name of Assemblyman Marvin Sedway, a Democrat 
from Las Vegas, remained on the ballot, despite his death in July of lung 
cancer. It had been too late to remove his name. A political unknown, Charles 
Wakefield, was also running. If Sedway wins the primary, the Clark County 
Democratic Committee would name the Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates hurt in the plane crash had gone to Fallon for a Labor Day 
parade and had just taken off in a Cessna 411 for Carson City, the state 
capital, when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Wagner's husband, Peter B. Wagner, was killed in a plane crash 
10 years ago in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill County Sheriff Bill Lawry said that soon after taking off, the right 
engine of Seale's plane lost power. Seale had turned back toward the airport in 
an attempt at an emergency landing when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The force of the impact, in a grassy desert area about a mile short of the 
airport, sheared off one of the plane's wings. 
</P>
<P>
One of the passengers, Brian Krolicki, Seale's campaign manager, walked to a 
nearby ranch house, despite his injuries, to seek aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after takeoff, we knew there was a problem," Krolicki said later. "Then 
I saw smoke coming out of the right-hand engine. The next thing I knew I was 
sitting in the middle of the desert trying to take off my seat belt." 
</P>
<P>
Seale underwent surgery on his left wrist and left heel for compound fractures. 
He also suffered a lung injury as well as facial burns. Wagner had a spinal 
fracture.

</P>
<P>
THE CRISIS IS FORCING A NEW AGENDA ON LAWMAKERS. IT MAY STRENGTHEN BUSH'S HAND 
AND LOWER BUDGET-CUTTERS' GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Middle East crisis promises to revamp much of the agenda of the 101st 
Congress as it starts down the homestretch today. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hit just before lawmakers went on their August 
recess, and they are returning in a far more anxious mood. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are expected to affect both substance and scheduling on everything 
from deficit-reduction talks to weapons programs, from the clean air bill to 
President Bush's nomination of New Hampshire jurist David H. Souter to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, believes 
that Bush's widely praised handling of the Persian Gulf crisis "probably will 
strengthen his hand in almost all matters" before Congress, including 
persuading lawmakers to sustain any new vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been successful on all 13 of his vetoes to date. 
</P>
<P>
Senate and House Democratic leaders generally disagree that the President has 
been bolstered all that much in the legislative arena. But House Budget 
Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) suggests that the gulf 
turmoil may help reduce the frequent partisan wrangling that has occurred 
between Congress and the President. 
</P>
<P>
"The bipartisan support for the President forces both parties to recognize that 
they are better off if they work together rather than fight each other over the 
remaining weeks of the session," said Panetta, who is a former Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers and aides say the Middle East flare-up undoubtedly will prolong the 
debates over how to reduce the budget deficit and how to reshape the nation's 
defense program -- possibly squeezing immigration, child care and other bills 
off the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
However, high-priority civil rights, anti-crime, farm and housing measures are 
not likely to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, crisis-generated pressures on the economy may undercut 
legislation that is costly to business, such as the sweeping rewriting of the 
Clean Air Act. Also in question is whether Congress will be able to adjourn 
sometime in October or will be forced to return for a lame-duck session after 
the November elections -- possibly to consider a pay raise and a limit on 
honorariums for senators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Budget Deficit 
</P>
<P>
In the most dramatic impact of the crisis, Administration and congressional 
negotiators seem likely to sharply lower their goal for reducing the federal 
deficit, which many analysts believe will soar above $200 billion for the 
fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deep defense cuts and a large energy-tax increase -- once seen as key 
components of a budget deal -- now are in doubt, reflecting worries about a 
possible recession, increased fuel prices and the huge Desert Shield deployment 
of U.S. forces in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit-reduction talks over the last several months have been aimed at 
cutting the fiscal 1991 deficit by $50 billion -- 25% of it from cuts in 
defense spending, 25% in domestic program cuts and 50% in "revenue increases." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the prospect of reduced defense cuts and smaller tax increases, 
strategists say the deficit reduction may total as little as $25 billion -- 
because there is scant political support for bearing down more heavily on 
domestic programs such as Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is the key because defense tells you, at least from a fairness point 
of view, what kind of contribution you can look for from the other areas," 
Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the one-time giddy talk of a "peace dividend" for social and 
environmental causes is gone. "The thief of Baghdad has stolen our peace 
dividend," Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) lamented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Programs 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of besieged weapons programs, from the B-2 Stealth bomber to the C-17 
cargo plane and "Star Wars" missile interceptors, are hoping for a new boost 
from the Middle East crisis as the military policy bills enter their crucial 
final stages. 
</P>
<P>
The best example is the bat-wing, radar-eluding Stealth aircraft. In July, the 
House Armed Services Committee voted overwhelmingly to end B-2 production at 
the 15 planes that had been funded. 
</P>
<P>
But, in August, right after the Iraqi invasion, the Senate voted narrowly to 
fund two new planes in 1991 -- consistent with Bush's plan to reduce the total 
purchase to 75 from 132 and to trim total costs to $61 billion from $72 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
B-2 supporters believe they now have the momentum to prevail in a looming 
Senate-House conference showdown between Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Rep. Les 
Aspin (D-Wis.), the chairmen of Congress' Armed Services committees. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has begun a new lobbying effort to save the B-2, which is being 
built at Northrop Corp. plants in Pico-Rivera and Palmdale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkish Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), a key member of the House defense 
appropriations subcommittee, emerged from an Air Force briefing last week 
declaring that "if we had had the B-2 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, we could have 
had incredible capability to go after targets deep within Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
"It would have given the President another option that might have shocked 
(Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein and brought this matter to a close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bomber was designed primarily to penetrate Soviet airspace in a 
nuclear war that now seems remote, Dicks says that the B-2 could have taken off 
from its Missouri base, been refueled by aerial tankers on the way to Iraq and 
then bombed chemical and nuclear weapon plants and other targets -- including 
Hussein's headquarters -- before landing at Diego Garcia, a U.S. base in the 
Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio), who, with Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) is 
leading a fight to halt B-2 production, says he will argue that nothing has 
changed for the bomber's future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (gulf) crisis will probably increase overall defense spending," 
Kasich said. "And, as long as the increases are on things like readiness, 
training and weapons with greater mobility and flexibility, fine. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "the idea we should commit ourselves to a bunch of new Cold 
War weapons would be a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Issues 
</P>
<P>
Emissions laws. A proposed tightening of Clean Air Act restrictions on motor 
vehicle and industrial emissions, now in a House-Senate conference, also could 
be affected by the Middle East troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill could be undermined because of the new concern over energy and the 
degree to which the gulf crisis, along with other economic trends, are pushing 
the economy closer to a recession," one key congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crisis helps out people who are concerned about increased costs to 
business and the impact on coal miners" threatened by crackdowns on 
coal-burning plants. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who is the bill's 
prime mover in the House, argues that the case for strengthening 
alternative-fuel provisions has improved in light of the new danger to oil 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing the use of cleaner-burning, domestically produced ethanol and 
methanol would "benefit the environment and lessen dependence on imported oil," 
Waxman contended. 
</P>
<P>
Souter nomination. Meanwhile, some think the Souter nomination, which is being 
challenged by abortion rights advocates wary of his vague views, might have 
calmer sailing now. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is it will be a lot less controversial than otherwise because, at a 
time of national crisis, people will not be looking for a reason to divide the 
country," political analyst Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
But an aide to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.), who will preside over confirmation hearings that begin Sept. 13, 
insists that the conservative New Hampshire jurist still will be scrutinized 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
Energy policy. The invasion of oil-rich Kuwait is almost certain to heat up the 
moribund debate over energy policy, reverberating in debates over the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve and offshore oil and gas drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
Related Senate and House bills call for expanding the oil reserve at costs 
opposed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has a lot more on its plate, from re-regulation of cable television to 
a significant increase in the number of visas to be granted to legal immigrants 
-- particularly Europeans -- who are being kept out by the current system. 
</P>
<P>
As always happens, Congress will not be able to digest many major bills before 
it adjourns, and leftovers will have to be reintroduced in the 102nd Congress. 
But there's no doubt that the problem has been compounded by the current 
international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the agenda has been knocked into a cocked hat to no one's apparent 
benefit," sighed a House leadership aide.

IRAQI TROOPS IN KUWAIT SAID TO SUFFER CRITICAL SHORTAGES; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: ARAB COMMANDERS QUOTE DEFECTORS, SAY MANY OF FOE'S TANKS COULD BE 
USELESS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi troops massed in Kuwait are suffering from critical shortages of food, 
water, fuel and ammunition, according to defectors from the Iraqi military. 
</P>
<P>
Arab military commanders, as well as the U.S. commanders backing up the Arab 
positions, said the shortages could make useless many of the 1,500 Iraqi tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The shortages, and their corrosive effect on Iraq's military capability, are 
largely a result of world trade sanctions against Iraq, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And the shortages come at a time when the U.S. and Arab forces are increasing 
their strength, with major new deployments in the next two weeks, including 
hundreds of U.S. tanks and anti-tank helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Military commanders said the arrival of additional troops in Saudi Arabia, 
together with the tightening economic stranglehold on Iraq, is helping to even 
the numerical odds that were stacked against Saudi Arabia and its allies in the 
first month of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many U.S. and Arab military officials interviewed here said, the 
likelihood of Saudi Arabia and the United States launching an offensive into 
Kuwait may be increasing. 
</P>
<P>
These views appear to be at odds with widespread speculation in Washington and 
elsewhere that the failure of the embargo -- not its success -- could result in 
a U.S.-Saudi move into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi defectors are coming in -- in tanks and armored personnel carriers -- 
at the rate of 50 to 100 a day in the western sector, said Brig. Gen. Mohammed 
Shehri, the Saudi army officer in charge of logistics for the Arab troops here. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned from what we saw that they are really in a very poor condition," 
Shehri said. "They don't know the terrain, and there is no help from the 
Kuwaitis or Bedouins." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the state of the equipment brought over by the defectors, the 
general said, "I really don't think they can use all their tanks." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the defectors are enlisted men, and their morale is low, according to 
Saudi officers. But Gen. Shehri said that some of the defectors are 
lieutenants, captains and majors. 
</P>
<P>
Many defecting troops say they were told on Aug. 1, the day before Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, that they were going to Kuwait to drill with forces of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council, which is made up of the six countries on the Arabian 
Peninsula. Others said they were told they were going to attack Israel via 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials said that the chemical weapons protection gear the Iraqi 
soldiers are carrying is old and probably ineffective.. 
</P>
<P>
This prompted Shehri to suggest that there is more bluster than reality to the 
much-feared Iraqi threat to use chemical weapons against troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's more for propaganda," he said. "They will have problems first 
before we do." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Iraqis' mounting supply problems, the Arab troops arrayed across 
Saudi Arabia are a lightly armed force that U.S. officers describe as a "trip 
wire." Its mission, according to Saudi military officials, is to delay the 
advance of an Iraqi offensive for about four hours while U.S. forces move up 
from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab force is also designed to help channel tanks into "killing zones" 
where the Saudis and their allies would concentrate their tanks and anti-tank 
weapons to even the odds. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, however, Saudi Arabia's Arab and Muslim forces would likely have 
major problems. For example, Egypt, which is contributing one of the larger 
Arab forces, has never conducted exercises with its new Arab military allies. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the nine national forces operating here -- soon to be 10 with the arrival 
of Pakistani troops -- use a variety of different -- and sometimes incompatible 
-- weapons and equipment. In combat, this would further complicate the 
difficult task of supply. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, as the 30,000 or so Arab troops take up defensive positions near 
the Kuwaiti border, the question arises: Do they have enough tanks to blunt 
even an Iraqi offensive debilitated by morale and supply problems? 
</P>
<P>
"Inshallah (God willing), we can," said Col. Abdul Aziz Bedawi, a Saudi tank 
commander. "Inshallah, we have enough tanks." 
</P>
<P>
But facing a larger force across the flat, featureless desert, the Saudis and 
their Arab allies are counting on air power to delay an Iraqi advance. 
</P>
<P>
"When he becomes tired, exhausted, during the day, we will have a field day," 
said a captain who commands a helicopter unit. "When he comes at night, the air 
force will take care of him." 
</P>
<P>
Among Arab forces, however, that is as close to boasting as the officers get. 
There is among Saudi and other Arab forces little of the bluster found among 
some American troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to enhance the defensive capabilities and help defend Saudi 
territories . . . to defend the holy places (Mecca and Medina)," said Maj. Gen. 
Mohammed Bilal, commander of the Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian forces consist of paratroopers and anti-tank commandos, and a 
Saudi official said that if an Iraqi offensive comes, the Egyptian troops will 
likely be dropped behind the Iraqi tanks to disrupt their supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
Although Saudi and other Arab officers sought to minimize the offensive option, 
several said that if Iraqi troops do come across, the Arab commanders will 
launch a counteroffensive aimed at liberating Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officers said it is more likely that the Arab forces will back up the 
American lines as the American forces move north.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a sweltering 13-hour journey, two convoys of buses arrived in Baghdad 
late Tuesday with hundreds of Western women and children from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, three Iraqi Airways charter flights, financed by the U.S., 
British and West German governments, flew hundreds of additional refugees -- 
Iraqi-Americans, Germans, Irish and other Europeans -- from Baghdad to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the West had given in to an Iraqi demand that the 
foreigners be flown out exclusively on aircraft of the state-run Iraqi airline. 
</P>
<P>
On board the flights to Jordan were 25 of the estimated 100 American women and 
children stranded in Iraq. U.S. officials spent the day negotiating with Iraqi 
officials in an effort to charter flights for the estimated 1,400 American 
women and children still in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the three planes that arrived in Amman from Baghdad reportedly 
carried 170 people, mostly Arabs and Asians but also an Englishwoman and her 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
On the second plane were 135 West Germans and a number of New Zealanders, Irish 
and other Westerners, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The third flight carried, in addition to 25 Americans, 44 French, 36 British, 
four Australians and two Canadian women and children, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official in Kuwait, asked why his government had not followed the 
British and German example and organized bus convoys to Baghdad, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very arduous trip. To send hundreds . . . of women and children across 
the desert without men is cruel. So we're trying to get them out by air." 
</P>
<P>
The bus convoys, the first official departures of foreigners from Kuwait since 
the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2, apparently went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
The buses were given an official Iraqi army escort, and Western diplomats here 
praised the Iraqi government for improving the processing of the refugees, who 
were freed from detention a week ago by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
British officials who organized the larger of the bus convoys -- seven vehicles 
carrying 306 women and children -- said the Iraqis have become more 
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gotten more helpful," British Ambassador Harold Walker said in an 
interview with Britain's Independent Television News. "They've had time to get 
their bureaucratic procedures in line." 
</P>
<P>
But in London the Foreign Office condemned Baghdad for adding more Western male 
captives to the human shield Iraq is putting together in the hope of fending 
off attack by the U.S.-led multinational force massing in Saudi Arabia across 
the border from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 18 British men have been rounded up in recent days, bringing to 
40 the number of British nationals now held at strategic installations, the 
Foreign Office said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they have no firm number for American men held in these 
circumstances -- at power plants, airfields, refineries, factories, 
communications centers and fuel depots. U.S. officials said they know of only 
about a dozen and that they also know nothing of the whereabouts of about 500 
American men who were in Kuwait city when the invasion took place. 
</P>
<P>
According to Westerners arriving in Baghdad from Kuwait, the situation in the 
occupied emirate is worsening by the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly," Ambassador Walker was quoted as saying, "things have been getting 
worse in Kuwait itself." 
</P>
<P>
Fay Sheraidah, an Iraqi-American among those who were flown out to Amman on 
Tuesday, described the past month, which she spent hiding in Kuwait, as "not 
very nice." Sheraidah, who left her Iraqi husband here in Baghdad and, along 
with her daughter, headed for her home in North Carolina, said: "In Kuwait, we 
felt very uncomfortable. We were hiding inside for the last month." 
</P>
<P>
Other refugees, who asked not to be identified by name, said there has been a 
marked increase in sniping and firebomb attacks by the Kuwaiti resistance and 
that the Iraqi troops have stepped up door-to-door searches in an effort to add 
to the human shield. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Iraq describes as "guests" the more than 200 foreigners it has 
detained and the thousands of other foreign men who have been barred from 
leaving the country. President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher have called them hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the men who are being left behind consider themselves hostages, 
and many say they are now afraid to leave their homes for fear of being caught 
in the human-shield roundups. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have no problems other than that we can't go out and we can't go 
home," Ray Herrod, an engineer from Houston, said in an interview with CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Herrod, one of 35 Americans at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Baghdad, said no 
one in the group ventures out except when it is absolutely necessary. Still, he 
said, Americans are probably safe "as long as we don't get out and make too 
much of a spectacle of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Like other Americans, Herrod said he has no doubt about his status. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they call us hostages or detainees or guests, we still can't leave," 
he said. "And if I can't leave, then that only leaves one word for me, and 
that's hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his group feels about the women and children leaving Kuwait and Iraq, 
Herrod said: "To see them go home is a great pleasure for us all. We just wish 
we were with them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Iraqi-Americans had mixed emotions about leaving. Nithal George, 
who left the other night for San Francisco, where she will join her husband, 
left her parents behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult," she said. "I'm happy and I'm sad -- happy because my husband 
is there, sad because I'm leaving my family and everybody here." 
</P>
<P>
For U.S. officials in Baghdad, who broke the impasse on departures Tuesday by 
accepting Iraq's demand that no foreign airlines take part in the evacuation, 
the charter flights do not constitute a violation of the U.N. embargo against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
They conceded that the West is paying Iraq in hard currency for the charters 
and that this is prohibited under the embargo and President Bush's executive 
order blockading Iraq. But they said there are provisions in both for 
humanitarian relief. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some Western diplomats said the concession represents a symbolic victory 
for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"They get their planes out, and now they can use them to get people and goods 
back in," one said. "It's also a matter of image and perception. They want to 
be seen as making this humanitarian gesture to the Western world, rather than 
sharing the glory with anyone else. But I'm not sure that, at the end of the 
day, it isn't going to backfire somehow."

<P>
Following the lead of the Soviet Union, the White House on Tuesday portrayed 
the upcoming summit conference in considerably grander terms than it had over 
the weekend, calling it the start of "a new foundation for world order." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's more upbeat description came after a top Soviet official 
described the Finland summit as "a major milestone." 
</P>
<P>
"A new foundation for world order is being built, and the spade work begins in 
Helsinki," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday. "This 
summit should provide an even stronger bond of unified opposition" to Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's somewhat ironic that the prospect of war is forging a new blueprint for 
world peace," Fitzwater added. "Both leaders will want to apply some new brush 
strokes to this emerging picture." 
</P>
<P>
With President Bush back at the White House after his much-interrupted vacation 
in Maine, the foreign policy operation turned immediately toward the task of 
preparing for his meeting Sunday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 
Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the White House advance team began working in Finland on Tuesday 
with their Soviet counterparts, laying the groundwork for the second meeting 
between Bush and Gorbachev in three months. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which the White House said was proposed by Bush, is being touted 
both as a reflection of new East-West relations and a demonstration of Bush's 
own preference for frequent, personal contact with other world leaders, 
particularly in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Administration took pains to play down expectations for the 
summit, with Bush simply expressing the hope that it would demonstrate unity of 
the two superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in a speech 
that the summit will become a "major milestone on the road toward resolving the 
crisis in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official said the world faces a "highly critical, emergency 
situation that has made necessary extraordinary action in the form of a special 
meeting between the Soviet and U.S. presidents." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater expressed no concern regarding the presence of approximately 193 
Soviet military advisers in Iraq, although U.S. officials had indicated that at 
the summit Bush would urge Gorbachev to pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, he said, "have explained that they have some large contracts there 
that require some people to be there, but by a large measure their people are 
leaving." 
</P>
<P>
"That's an understandable situation. You have to understand that the Soviet 
Union has been associated with Iraq for a number of years. They have changed 
policy in a most dramatic fashion, and we do not have any qualms or problems 
about their overall support. We have asked them to please withdraw these 
people, and we believe they are doing so as soon as they can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Fitzwater and others demonstrated the Administration's efforts 
to make it clear that very little space separates the United States and the 
Soviet Union on the Persian Gulf issue. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III said, "I don't know where we would be with this effort if it 
hadn't been for the enlightened new thinking of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union has proved a responsible partner, suggesting new 
possibilities for active superpower cooperation in resolving regional 
conflicts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a mirror image of Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov's 
chiding of Soviet military leaders concerned about U.S. action in the gulf, 
Baker said, "There is some old thinking in this country" about keeping the 
Soviets as far away as possible from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if Moscow wants to send military forces to join the international 
deployment in the gulf, they would be welcomed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is unlikely that the Soviets would participate, however, unless 
"there was a blue (U.N.) flag over the force." 
</P>
<P>
Although the gulf crisis provided the impetus for the meeting, the two leaders 
will also review the status of negotiations to reduce conventional, or 
non-nuclear, weapons in Europe, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents will not be negotiating details of this agreement, but they 
will be attempting to add the impetus that would ensure that that agreement is 
ready to sign" in time for a 35-nation East-West summit planned in Paris in 
November or December. 
</P>
<P>
Other topics will include such regional issues as the future of Cambodia and 
the efforts to end the civil war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush liked the "unstructured" format of the meetings he held 
with Gorbachev in Malta last December and would try to duplicate that format. 
</P>
<P>
The exact schedule is still being planned, but the White House spokesman said 
there would be morning, afternoon and luncheon sessions. Bush plans to leave 
Washington Friday evening and fly overnight to Helsinki, meeting with Finnish 
leaders on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman held out the possibility that Bush would continue on 
the road from Helsinki, perhaps meeting with other leaders elsewhere in Europe, 
before returning to Washington. He said there are no plans for the President to 
go to the Persian Gulf region.

U.S. OUTLINES CONTAINMENT STRATEGY FOR MIDEAST PEACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In suggesting the creation of a new multinational organization to guarantee 
security and stability in the Middle East, the Bush Administration for the 
first time has sketched its vision of a solution for the turbulent region that 
would outlive the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the proposal essentially 
would seek to transplant to the Middle East the strategy of containment that 
the United States successfully pursued for more than 40 years in its Cold War 
against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Operating like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the new entity would 
seek to assemble an overwhelming coalition to repel military aggression by Iraq 
-- or any other nation that might rise up to pose a threat to the region and 
its vast energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The principle is sound, as the success of NATO has shown. But attempts to 
create similar structures elsewhere have been less successful, leaving it far 
from clear whether the approach could succeed in such a different political 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that the approach could even be disastrous. They say that it 
could inflame Arab resentment at Western intervention, ultimately undercutting 
the support of even the most friendly nations in the region for the concept. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this would not be well received among the Arab populations," said 
Shireen T. Hunter, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts -- expressing what U.S. officials said is the growing 
consensus within the Bush Administration -- argue that there is no other 
conceivable model for a truly lasting solution in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only hope," said Judith Kipper, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution. "You have to build in deterrents and red lines and green lines 
before you can have peace." 
</P>
<P>
Baker provided only spare details of Administration thinking in his testimony 
before Congress on Tuesday, insisting that planning for the long term remains 
in an embryonic stage. 
</P>
<P>
He made clear, however, that the United States now expects to maintain "some 
continuing (military) presence" in the region as part of a new Middle East 
security organization to be composed primarily of Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
And in drawing the explicit parallel to NATO, Baker suggested that the new 
security arrangement could serve as such a powerful deterrent "that there would 
be very little risk" that a Middle Eastern leader might be tempted to resort to 
armed conflict to further his goals. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that the remarks reflect a Bush 
Administration conclusion that the United States must take steps to "contain" 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein even if he ultimately agrees to withdraw his forces 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean that you have to get rid of him, but you do have to contain 
him," the senior official said. He added: "We need a broader security 
structure, one that ensures access to the energy of the region." 
</P>
<P>
With the United States likely to provide the decisive military power, the 
security arrangement that the Administration appears to have in mind might most 
closely resemble not NATO but the regional treaty organizations established in 
the 1950s in efforts to block Soviet expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But as critics note, those experiments were far from outright successes. The 
Baghdad Pact -- a 1954 anti-Soviet alliance made up of Middle Eastern powers 
and backed by Britain -- collapsed of its own weight four years later when 
Iraqi opposition to the close links to the West contributed to a revolution 
that ousted the monarchy and put Iraq squarely in the Soviet camp. 
</P>
<P>
And the separate Southeast Asian Treaty, signed by the United States and other 
world and regional powers in 1954, established a U.S. obligation to the region 
that historians regard as a principal factor motivating the American entry into 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
In citing these lessons, analysts said Thursday that any American decision to 
create a new security organization carries with it the danger of a backlash in 
the Arab world and could heighten the prospect of U.S. involvement in conflict 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, many experts warned that simmering Arab hostility toward U.S. 
involvement in the region could turn dangerous if it became clear that the 
American presence would be long-term. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to say -- pact or no pact -- this is just a justification to 
get the United States involved," said Hunter, the CSIS analyst. As a result, 
she and others suggested, regimes friendly to the United States might be 
overthrown, undermining the Arab base for the security treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, however, contend that the prospect of domestic turmoil in the 
Middle East is a risk far more acceptable than the bloodshed that they said 
inevitably would continue without some multilateral effort to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't live with this the way it is," said Kipper of Brookings. But she 
cautioned that it probably is no longer within the power of the United States 
alone to persuade Arab nations to accept a permanent security organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be a joint U.S.-Soviet initiative," she said, "because that 
means it's serious."

Iraq announced Tuesday three post office box numbers where relatives and 
friends can send letters to detained foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Baghdad Radio said the "foreign guests" can receive mail via the 
"mail boxes of peace." The addresses are P.O. Box 39090, P.O. Box 50300 and 
P.O. Box 50285, all in Baghdad, Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Postal Service last week suspended service to Iraq and 
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, citing difficulties in transportation. A postal service 
spokesman in Washington could not immediately say if or how letters sent to the 
Iraqi post office boxes could be delivered.

Two school districts have put off the opening of classes for a week so students 
and teachers can help bring in perhaps the area's largest-ever harvest of wild 
blueberries. 
</P>
<P>
The school boards in Machias and Cherryfield have agreed to put off the start 
of the school year from this week until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local people, including youngsters and teachers, take part in the 
harvest every year. But so many blueberries are expected to be harvested from 
this year's bumper crop that picking is to continue well into September, unless 
it is cut short by frost, officials said.

PLAY EDUCATES FIELD WORKERS ABOUT RIGHTS, PESTICIDES 
</P>

As the sun was setting on Campo Tres S's Labor Camp, the routine noise of field 
workers lining up for dinner, watching television and washing clothes was 
broken by the sound of laughter, music and applause. 
</P>
<P>
The 200 men, most of them Mexican, who live in 65 green, barracks-like 
buildings were not celebrating a birthday or a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a visit from Teatro Nuestro, an Oregon-based theater troupe 
that uses satire, music and drama to educate farm workers about their legal 
rights and about the dangers of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the poor migrant workers, the play -- held on a makeshift stage 
outdoors in the middle of a basketball court -- was the first time they had 
experienced live theater. 
</P>
<P>
Performed almost entirely in Spanish, the production mesmerized the men, many 
of whom said later that they identified closely with the characters. 
</P>
<P>
The play told of a poor Mexican family struggling to make a decent life in 
America. It includes a maniacal Anglo boss who speaks in a goofy American 
accent and ignores the harmful effects pesticides have on his workers. It talks 
about the effects of machismo on a Latino woman and the power of a unified 
political effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The family scenes are the most serious because a lot of these men are far away 
from home," said Armando Morales, who plays the Mexican folk hero Super Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
For members of Teatro Nuestro and its accompanying band, Sandunga, playing in 
such rustic settings is not unusual. The group, founded in 1986, tries to bring 
its message to disenfranchised audiences, which the actors say are found mostly 
in rural communities and labor camps. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Ravetto, who portrays Don Tomas, the macho-yet-caring father, said the 
group recently played in the mountains near San Diego, where about 300 field 
workers lived in shacks made of sticks and cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes are not lavish and the simple sets were built with 2-by-4s and 
cloth. The group is sponsored by several foundations and such organizations as 
the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the California 
Rural Assistance League. 
</P>
<P>
"It's theater for the people," Ravetto said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group had previously performed at an elementary school in Oxnard. 
The actors decided to take the show to Campo Tres S's Labor Camp this year 
after recent allegations that hundreds of Mexican workers had been held in 
servitude at a flower ranch in Somis. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them they have rights, whether they have work papers or not," Morales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the band began to play, the field laborers -- most still dressed in work 
clothes caked with mud from the fields -- stood against a nearby building, 
cautious about the free show being offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
However, by the time the first act began, more than 150 men had gathered close 
to the stage, some sitting on the ground, others in folding chairs and a few 
watching from the open windows and doors of their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
According to the author, Cheyney Ryan, the play was drawn from the traditions 
and experiences of poor Latino field workers living in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people have never seen theater in their lives, so they believe 
that Don Tomas is real," Ravetto said. 
</P>
<P>
When Don Tomas tells his daughter, Maria (played by Estela Loera) that she is 
not going to college but instead will marry the man of his choosing, many of 
the men nod in support. 
</P>
<P>
And when Don Tomas' wife, Consuelo (played by May O'Conner Morales), asks 
rhetorically whether everyone is as crazy as her husband, a man in the audience 
answers: "Un poco." 
</P>
<P>
Later, a gray-haired man in the front row wipes at his eyes and shakes his head 
when Don Tomas begins to read a heart-wrenching letter from his wife after he 
is deported to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The solemn mood of the play is broken by the Anglo patron (played by Cully 
Fredricksen), a cigar-smoking, lanky boss whose wife serves him Kentucky Fried 
Chicken for his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Ravetto said the play gives the men a rare opportunity to jeer at a character 
who symbolizes the kind of bosses many have had. 
</P>
<P>
In the final act, the Sanchez family unites to defeat the dreaded Pesticido -- 
a skull-faced harbinger of death -- with the encouragement of Super Barrio, who 
tells Don Tomas: "The greatest force you have is the people united." 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Ruis Rojas, a gardener who said he loved to hate Pesticido, said the play 
taught him about the power of a united people. 
</P>
<P>
Segundo Alvarez, a field worker who has lived in the camp for three years, said 
the play hit close to home for him because he suffered eye irritations from 
pesticides several years ago when he worked in the fields in the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For Pablo Rivera, another field worker, the section in the play when Don Tomas 
was taken from his family by La Migra reminded him how much he misses the 
family he left behind in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts a lot," he said.

WILDERNESS SOCIETY OFFICIAL CRITICAL OF PARK SERVICE QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level Wilderness Society official in California who led a campaign 
criticizing the concession management at Yosemite National Park resigned 
Tuesday, charging that the environmental group stripped her of some job duties 
under pressure from the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Schifferle, formerly the Wilderness Society's regional director for 
California and Nevada, was removed from her post and told that she could no 
longer pursue efforts to reduce development in Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite National Park Supt. Michael Finley had complained about Schifferle to 
Wilderness Society officials in Washington and joined executives of the park's 
concessionaire in criticizing her in the news media. Wilderness Society 
officials said outside complaints did not trigger the reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle has headed a highly publicized campaign to push the Park Service and 
its concessionaire to reduce development in heavily congested Yosemite Valley. 
In the course of her efforts, she has frequently rankled park officials and 
executives of the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., the MCA Inc. subsidiary that 
runs the concession under a park contract and owns many of the buildings in the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Wilderness Society) believe they can get more environmental 
protection through accommodation," Schifferle said. "I believe, in this 
particular instance, we will get more protection for the park by being the 
critics, and I think that is going to take aggressive action." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Tipton, the Wilderness Society's director of field operations, said 
Schifferle was shifted from regional director to senior counsel without loss of 
pay primarily because a back injury has prevented her from traveling as much as 
the job requires. 
</P>
<P>
"Patty has her own style, and she was very effective -- a very effective 
advocate for the Wilderness Society," Tipton said. "She was the most effective 
advocate we have had in California." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, in an interview earlier this summer, said the Wilderness Society under 
Schifferle blew small matters out of proportion. He complained that she would 
ask him to investigate potential problems in the park and immediately fax her 
letters to him to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle, 39, who formerly served as principal consultant to the state 
Assembly Transportation Committee, has accused Finley of being a "puppet of the 
Curry Co." She has helped organize an effort to establish a nonprofit group to 
bid against MCA for the concession contract when it comes up for renewal in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service will decide who gets the contract. Tipton said the Wilderness 
Society will continue to pursue the contract without Schifferle. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle, who ran the Wilderness Society's California office for four years, 
will now serve as director of special projects for Clean Water Action, an 
environmental group. But she said that she will continue to be involved with 
Yosemite issues.

PHILANTHROPIST 'DOLLY' GREEN; HEIRESS OWNED THOROUGHBREDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorothy Wellborn Green -- better known as Dolly Green, the socialite, 
philanthropist and racing stable owner -- died Tuesday at her Bel-Air home 
after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said Miss Green had requested that her age not be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Green, the last surviving child of Beverly Hills founder and oil magnate 
Burton E. Green, bought into thoroughbred horse racing in an attention-getting 
way in 1980 when she spent $2.2 million for five yearlings at the Keeneland 
sale in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it was the most exciting thing," the irrepressible Miss Green later said 
of the auction. "I couldn't believe, after all these years, I was actually 
bidding on a horse. . . . Then to bid that kind of money for a horse. My, I did 
have some trepidations." 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that her only involvement with horse racing before that auction was 
attending races, Miss Green was initially considered a "mystery woman" in 
horse-racing circles. 
</P>
<P>
But she worked at her new interest, spending part of her profits from the 
$3.6-billion sale of her father's Belridge Oil Co. to Shell Oil Co. in 1979 to 
build her stable of horses and hire top trainers and jockeys. At one point, she 
owned 74 Thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Miss Green's filly, Brave Raj, won the $1-million Breeders' Cup race 
for juvenile fillies at Santa Anita and was voted the Eclipse Award as champion 
2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quick, short and wonderful, wasn't it?" was her reaction to the victory 
run. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Miss Green established the Dolly Green Equine Research Lab of the 
Southern California Equine Foundation in Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Green had served as trustee of the Burton E. Green Foundation, which was 
set up in her father's name after his death in 1965 at the age of 96. 
</P>
<P>
Her own charities included endowment of the Dolly Green Scholars Award at 
UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute. She was a former member of the Los Angeles 
Junior League and the advisory board of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild. 
</P>
<P>
A popular socialite and hostess for six decades, Miss Green reportedly startled 
her socially prominent parents in her youth by refusing to be presented at a 
formal coming-out party. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to perfect myself in several studies. I would rather study languages, 
even law, if I could do so, in preference to a life of parties and dinners and 
teas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Green was an alumna of Marlborough School. Her late sister, Liliore Green 
Rains, who had no college education, left $240 million to Pomona College, 
Stanford University, Loyola Marymount University, Caltech and two hospitals, 
when she died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Her other sister, Burton Bettingen, died in 1986. Miss Green is survived by a 
niece and a nephew.

CHILE, 'REPAIRING AN INJUSTICE,' REBURIES ALLENDE 
</P>

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chile unearthed the remains of former Marxist President Salvador Allende from a 
humble grave Tuesday and reburied his body in the capital in a solemn ceremony 
17 years after his death in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Santiago with banners, flags 
and portraits to pay homage to Allende, who 20 years ago Tuesday became the 
first Marxist president freely elected in the Western hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
His remains were placed in a marble mausoleum at Santiago's main cemetery, 
where other Chilean presidents and dignitaries are buried. The military, which 
toppled Allende in the bloody 1973 coup, was conspicuously absent from the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The event was marked by appeals to preserve Chile's newly restored democratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We express our will to favor the future of our country, which demands from us 
to unite beyond the disputes that separated us in the past," President Patricio 
Aylwin said in a speech at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin, an elected civilian who was a political foe of Allende, succeeded Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet last March, putting an end to 16 1/2 years of authoritarian 
military rule. Pinochet, who led the coup against Allende, remains commander in 
chief of the army. 
</P>
<P>
Allende died during an attack on his presidential palace on Sept. 11, 1973. The 
military said he committed suicide rather than surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Allende's remains were unearthed early in the day from a modest family tomb in 
the city of Vina del Mar. In Santiago, thousands of people lined the streets to 
view the flag-draped coffin. The procession drove past the presidential palace, 
the Catholic cathedral and, finally, the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing politicians said the ceremony was an attempt to gain political 
advantage for the government and the left. But the government said the reburial 
was "repairing an injustice toward a man who was a legitimate president of 
Chile." 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin was booed when he recalled in his speech that he had opposed the Allende 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Raising his voice, the 71-year-old president replied: "To those who are booing, 
I say: The only language that will allow us to understand each other is the 
language of truth. 
</P>
<P>
"The horror and suffering that Chile has gone through should never happen 
again," he added. "It's a task for all Chileans to prevent it, and we will be 
able to do so only if we reject hatred and violence." 
</P>
<P>
Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi, said Tuesday's ceremonies "should be seen as 
a contribution to reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Security around the ceremonies was tight. Four bombs went off overnight in 
Santiago, causing minor damage to two military monuments and two shops, but no 
injuries. A right-wing group claimed responsibility.

WOMAN FILES CLASS-ACTION SUIT OVER DIET SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Ventura woman has filed a class-action suit against Nutri-System 
Inc., claiming that her gall bladder had to be removed after she lost 34 pounds 
in 18 weeks on the company's diet program. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Alyne Kirkham's suit filed in Ventura County Superior Court claims that 
Nutri-System caused her to lose weight too quickly, which led to gall bladder 
disease. The suit accuses Nutri-System of falsely advertising itself as a safe 
way to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
It also claims that Nutri-System officials knew about a link between too-rapid 
weight loss and gall bladder disease and should have warned her and other 
customers about it. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for an injunction to force the company to put warnings on its 
product labels, and it seeks unspecified damages that could reach into the 
millions, said Kirkham's attorney, Louis M. Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Nutri-System officials and Chief Executive Officer Donald McCulloch Jr. could 
not be reached Tuesday evening for comment. In the face of earlier criticism 
alleging that the program causes overly swift weight loss, Nutri-System 
officials have said the program is medically safe. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a CBS News report last month, Marlin said more than 200 people 
nationwide have sued Nutri-System. They alleged that they contracted gall 
bladder disease while using the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Kirkham's suit is the first in the country to seek a court's 
designation as a class action against Nutri-System on behalf of an untold 
number of potential plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to include anyone who used Nutri-System since the company was 
founded July 18, 1979, and who later contracted gall bladder disease, Marlin 
said. He said he has been approached by nine people seeking to join the suit 
since it was filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin said Kirkham began using Nutri-System in December to try to trim her 
weight from 216 to 155. Kirkham spent $99 in initiation fees and more than 
$1,200 for 19 weeks' worth of Nutri-System foods and began losing weight 
rapidly as she substituted the food for her regular fare, Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
By early April, Kirkham had slimmed down to 182 pounds, losing an average of 2 
1/2 to 3 pounds per week, Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
But one night in February while watching television, Kirkham suffered stabbing 
abdominal pains, Marlin said. Believing she was just feeling stress, she took 
Tylenol and went to bed, and the pains were gone by morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In early April, Kirkham suffered another bout with abdominal pain, which again 
subsided after she took pain killers and went to bed for the night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then June 12, abdominal pains struck again, leaving Kirkham doubled over on the 
floor of her home, unable to stand, Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Kirkham was admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, 
where doctors removed her gall bladder, including a gallstone the diameter of a 
quarter, Marlin said. Although Kirkham lost eight weeks' work while recovering 
from surgery, she might not suffer any long-term damage from the removal of the 
organ, Marlin said.

JUDGE RULES AGAINST FIRM IN BIAS SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: BUT THE ATTORNEY FOR THE SATICOY LEMON ASSN. SAYS THE COURT FOUND NO 
EVIDENCE OF CURRENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FEMALE EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that a Ventura County lemon-packing 
company illegally discriminated against as many as 100 female job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Strauss, who filed the class-action suit on behalf of the women, said the 
Saticoy Lemon Assn. could be liable for damages totaling at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the decision," Strauss said. "The women are winning 
everything that they could win." 
</P>
<P>
But Saticoy's attorney disputed the estimated damages and said the company won 
a partial victory because the judge found no evidence of current discrimination 
against women. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion filed last week in U.S. District Court, Judge John G. Davies 
found that Saticoy, which operates five packinghouses in Ventura County, 
violated federal and state laws in 1986 by failing to hire women for jobs that 
were later given to male applicants. 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, Davies cited statistics gathered by the plaintiffs' expert 
witness showing that 44 of 45 people Saticoy hired that year were men. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that Saticoy was responsible for the hiring policies of the 
Seaboard Lemon Assn., an independent lemon-packing company that Saticoy 
acquired four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After the merger, many of the female workers who were laid off at the end of 
the previous growing season were never rehired by Saticoy, according to the 
lawsuit. They alleged that they were passed over for jobs in favor of less 
experienced male applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Saticoy's attorney, George Preonas, said the judge gave something to both sides 
when he found no evidence that Saticoy now practices discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made no finding that there's any continuing discrimination," Preonas 
said. "The judge agreed with us that these were all stale claims." 
</P>
<P>
The exact number of plaintiffs is unknown because some have moved or not heard 
of the suit, Strauss said. The legal dispute has already been lengthy and 
bitter, and the women might have to wait years for any monetary awards. 
</P>
<P>
He said they are entitled to the pay they would have earned had they been hired 
by Saticoy when they applied for work, with that pay ranging from $20,000 to 
$50,000 per worker. The judge still has to specify who can seek damages and the 
process for making claims. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said he plans to meet with a group of former workers later this month 
to explain the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attorneys have been asked to file arguments by Oct. 1 on whether an 
injunction should be issued barring Saticoy from further allegedly 
discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's anything in the present practices that is improper," 
Preonas said. Saticoy employs more than 400 workers at packinghouses in 
Fillmore, Oxnard, Santa Paula, Saticoy and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Preonas acknowledged that some of the women who had worked at Seaboard and 
applied at Saticoy after the 1986 merger should have been rehired. 
</P>
<P>
Preonas, however, blamed a lack of job openings after the merger, not 
discrimination.

LAWYER FIRES BACK IN FRYMAN CANYON SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for the proposed developer of Fryman Canyon said Tuesday that a 
lawsuit filed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is a bid to depress the 
value of his client's 63-acre property in the hills above Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ben Reznik said the long-expected lawsuit is "part of a pattern of 
attempts to drive down the price of Mr. (Fred) Sahadi's property." 
</P>
<P>
For several months, the conservancy has been negotiating to buy the entire 
Fryman Canyon site, a steeply sloped area covered with oak and walnut trees and 
intersected by a stream. The talks have often been tumultuous, and the two 
parties have sharply disagreed over price. The state agency says the canyon is 
worth $8.7 million, while Sahadi has had it appraised at $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston denied Reznik's charges, saying the 
agency's lawsuit and its negotiations to buy Fryman Canyon are "separate 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names the City of Los Angeles and Sahadi as defendants. It seeks to 
require Sahadi to dedicate 32 acres of the canyon to the conservancy 
immediately, which would prohibit Sahadi from building a temporary road across 
that land. The temporary road would provide construction access to 31 other 
acres of the site, on which Sahadi wants to build 26 luxury houses. 
</P>
<P>
Dedication of the 32 acres to the conservancy was one of the primary 
requirements during the city's review of Sahadi's project, the conservancy's 
lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said the conservancy had misread the city's tract map conditions. He 
said the city did not require Sahadi to deed the 32 acres to the conservancy 
until after he had finished his project, which allows the use of the 32-acre 
site for the road. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Sahadi offered the 32 acres to the conservancy in 1986 
to satisfy one of the conditions imposed in 1982 as a prerequisite to obtaining 
a major development permit, known as a final tract map. On Nov. 3, 1986, the 
conservancy board accepted the offer. On March 5, 1987, a city official agreed 
that Sahadi had lived up to the condition. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, the city granted Sahadi a final tract map. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit claims that the city Planning Department mistakenly agreed that 
Sahadi had met the open-space condition although it had "no evidence" that the 
land had been transferred to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed Friday, only days after Sahadi began minor construction work 
on the site and posted no-trespassing signs to shut down the Betty B. Dearing 
Trail, a hiking path that cuts across the property and that the suit said was 
supposed to be dedicated for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that the trail was first opened to the public in 1985, Edmiston told 
reporters Tuesday at a news conference overlooking the canyon that "it's a sad 
day when we have to file a lawsuit to regain that trail." 
</P>
<P>
Saving the canyon from development has become a cause celebre of a band of 
environmentalists and several lawmakers, including state Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who attended the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also accused of failing to notify the conservancy in 1986 that it 
was considering Sahadi's request to build a temporary road across the land that 
was to be dedicated to the conservancy. The road was needed for hauling 388,000 
cubic yards of dirt across the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the road would "permanently destroy the open space," Edmiston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to building a road on the site would be to have the trucks haul 
the dirt through the winding city streets, Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's lawsuit was supported Tuesday by the filing of a second 
lawsuit by two environmental groups, Urban Wilderness Coalition and Mulholland 
Tomorrow. That lawsuit parallels the conservancy's charges, and disputes the 
legitimacy of a city grading permit issued to Sahadi.

DISTRICT TIGHTENS EXPENSE POLICIES

<P>
In the wake of alleged financial abuses by one of its members, the board of the 
Ventura County Community College District on Tuesday tightened its rules on 
reimbursement for telephone use and related business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the stricter policy, which also outlines rules for use of 
the district's telephone credit cards and car phones. 
</P>
<P>
The board also discussed proposed new rules for use of district fax machines 
and computers. The vote was 4 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
The policies, which board members said are intended to clarify existing rules 
on how district employees and board members may be reimbursed for business 
expenses, follow allegations of double-billing practices by board member James 
(Tom) Ely. Ely was absent from the meeting Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Under the district's new policy, board members may continue to receive, upon 
request, such equipment as telephones and fax machines at district expense, but 
their use shall be "solely for the conduct of district business." 
</P>
<P>
All requests for reimbursement must be accompanied by a detailed explanation of 
why the expense was incurred and how it relates to district business. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the district's expense policies arose earlier this year after 
the district launched an investigation into Ely's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ely and his wife, Ingrid, were charged with embezzlement, 
conspiracy to commit grand theft and making a false or fraudulent claim in 
connection with more than $12,000 in questionable expenses for which they were 
reimbursed by the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Elys, who pleaded innocent, are awaiting a preliminary hearing on the 
charges. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ILLEGAL DUMPING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Port Hueneme man pleaded guilty Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court to 
charges he dumped hazardous medical waste into a dumpster at a Port Hueneme 
condominium complex in March. 
</P>
<P>
Purnell Winbush, 26, a former courier for the Buenaventura Medical Clinic, 
admitted that he dumped 80 pounds of medical waste into a trash container at 
the Villa Seville condominiums on March 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush was supposed to be driving the waste from the clinic to the Community 
Memorial Hospital of San Buenaventura for sterilization and disposal, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a woman searching the dumpster for aluminum cans found several trash bags 
full of used hypodermic needles, scalpels, vials of blood and petri dishes that 
were used to test for diseases, police said. The woman reported the dumping to 
police, and a district attorney's investigation resulted in Winbush's arrest 
May 23. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors originally charged Winbush with two counts each of unlawful 
disposal of hazardous waste and unlawful transportation of hazardous waste. But 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda S. Groberg said her office plans to ask Judge Steven 
Z. Perren to dismiss one count of each charge at Winbush's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush faces a maximum penalty of three years and eight months in prison on 
the charges, which are felonies, Groberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush remains free on $2,500 bond pending his sentencing, scheduled for Nov.

COUNCIL SEEKS WORK ON TRAIN CROSSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula will send a second plea for help to have its degenerating railroad 
crossings improved, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kay Wilson will send letters to Southern Pacific railroad and the 
California Public Utilities Commission asking that repairs be made on 14 of the 
city's 15 crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of those crossings were found to present a danger of causing pedestrians 
to trip, including one crossing whose inner rail protrudes two inches above the 
track. Other hazards include potholes and rotten planking, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The council had written to Southern Pacific in June, 1989, offering to purchase 
rubber crossing materials to upgrade several of the trouble spots, but the 
company replied it did not have the manpower to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing further has been heard from the railroad, Norman Wilkinson, director of 
public works for Santa Paula, said. 
</P>
<P>
Mick Digiacomo, company projects manager for Southern Pacific, said the 
railroad could not install the rubber crossings at that time because Santa 
Paula was not on the company's yearly track revamping schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Digiacomo said, the company had undergone significant 
internal changes which will allow it to respond to the city's needs. "Santa 
Paula can get a better deal now. At the very least, we can patch" the problem 
areas, Digiacomo said. AMELIA CHAFFEE

OXNARD SECRET MEMOS UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
CONFIDENTIALITY: COUNCILWOMAN ANN JOHS SAYS MOST OF THE REPORTS THE COUNCIL 
RECEIVES FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY SHOULD BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the city attorney's office generates too many secret memos, Oxnard 
Councilwoman Ann Johs suggested Tuesday that the council review the city's 
policy on making them public. 
</P>
<P>
Johs, who is seeking reelection in November, said about 90% of the confidential 
memos the council gets from City Atty. Gary Gillig can be released to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
She said she made the proposal because she believes the public needs to have 
more access to the inner workings of City Hall. "I think we are losing the 
confidence of the public," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Johs' request was supported by Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who said Gillig 
recently wrote a memo on campaign reform laws that she believes should never 
have been considered confidential. Gillig later released an edited version of 
the report, which said putting limits on campaign spending violates the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi and Councilman Manuel Lopez did not address the matter 
during Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig took the week off from work to prepare for an appearance before the 
state Supreme Court in connection with a previous job and could not be reached 
for comment, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Paula Kimbrell, who was sitting in for Gillig, told the 
council on Tuesday that she would study Johs' request and draft a report on the 
matter for the council's consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Kimbrell said city policy requires the consent of at 
least four of the five council members before the city can release a 
confidential memo to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under a duty to maintain the confidentiality of our client, which in 
this case is the City Council," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Johs said she disagrees with the current 
policy. "I think it stinks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Johs suggested that the city's policy follow the guidelines of the 1953 Ralph 
M. Brown Act, which requires governing bodies to meet in public except when 
discussing litigation matters and personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Brown Act, Johs said the city should make public every 
city-generated document except those that discuss litigation and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said her complaint was prompted when Gillig wrote a confidential memo to 
the council a few months ago about state and federal campaign spending laws. 
The report was in response to a request by Maron, who suggested the council 
consider voluntary limits on campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
After the council discussed the memo at a public meeting in June, Gillig agreed 
to release to the public only the portions of the memo that were discussed by 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely ridiculous," Johs said. "There was nothing in there that 
couldn't have been released." 
</P>
<P>
Gillig has been the target of criticism lately. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a Ventura County grand jury report accused the Oxnard City Council of 
violating the Brown Act by holding five or six private meetings last September 
and October to discuss budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
All five council members said at the time that they met in closed session at 
Gillig's advice or with his consent. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gillig defended his advice to the council, saying the Ventura 
district attorney's office has a much stricter interpretation of the law than 
other district attorneys in the state.

ART SHOW RIBBONS GIVE PATIENTS A BOOST

<P>
The ribbons have been awarded and now the fun begins, said Jack Cheney, the art 
therapist at Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, patients at Camarillo have been stopping in Cheney's little 
studio tucked in a corner of the hospital to pick up their works of art, a 
small cash prize and ribbons from the Ventura County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cheney, nearly 140 paintings, sketchings and pastels created by 
mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients at the hospital received 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
About 240 works were entered in the annual competition. Forty-one received blue 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
He said he encourages patients to enter their works in the fair because the 
recognition gives them a boost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real good showcase for their art," he said. TINA DAUNT

TENANTS TO LEARN TO RUN PUBLIC HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the thousands of people who live in Nickerson Gardens will start going 
to class this week for lessons in how to take over their housing project, the 
largest in Los Angeles and one of the most troubled. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Nickerson Gardens residents are expected to show up for the beginning 
of a yearlong series of training sessions intended to help them form a 
management corporation that would gradually replace the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority in running the Watts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of many being launched in public housing projects around the 
country as the Bush Administration promotes tenant management and even 
ownership as answers to the festering problems of crime and vandalism that 
riddle many public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) want to make sure that every resident of public housing in the United 
States of America from Watts to East Los Angeles to the South Bronx to East 
Harlem has the opportunity to manage their own public housing and someday to 
own it if that's their dream," Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban 
development, said Tuesday before a crowd that filled a gymnasium at Nickerson 
Gardens to mark the official start of the training program. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp shared the stage with several other dignitaries, including Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), all of whom praised 
the trend toward tenant management as the beginning of a new era in public 
housing. "Nickerson is ready," declared Waters, who described herself as a 
child of St. Louis' housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The management training -- open to all adult Nickerson residents -- is being 
paid for by a $93,000 HUD grant, one of five such grants given to Los Angeles 
public housing projects. The others will go to the Estrada Courts, Jordan 
Downs, Normont Terrace and Pico Aliso projects. 
</P>
<P>
Nickerson has hired Bertha Gilkey to run the sessions, which will be held three 
times a month for the next year. Gilkey, a seemingly irrepressible advocate of 
tenant rights, is known nationally for helping notoriously bad housing 
projects, such as Cochran Gardens in St. Louis, clean up by putting the people 
who live there in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to the 6 million people in public housing in this country . . . it is 
time to challenge the system. . . . Who can better manage us than us?" Gilkey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are now more than a dozen public housing developments around the country 
that are run at least in part by tenants, and efforts are under way to start 
similar programs at more than 100 other housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp also announced that the Los Angeles Housing Authority will get $18 million 
this fiscal year to make improvements at its housing projects. Last year the 
authority received nearly $15 million for repairs and improvements, but housing 
officials say it would take more than $200 million to do all the improvement 
work they would like to do.

PADRES WANT CLARK, BUT THIS NIGHT, UMPIRES DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padre front office might cringe each time first baseman Jack Clark opens 
his mouth and wince every time he goes down with an injury, but club Chairman 
Tom Werner made it clear Tuesday that he will make every attempt to re-sign 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who returned from his vacation in Bermuda only to read about Clark's 
admonishment of ownership Friday over their initial contract offer, said 
Tuesday the outburst will have no effect on the Padres' commitment to bring him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not our style to negotiate with players in the press," Werner said 
before the Padres' 6-4 loss to the San Francisco Giants at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, "but we very much would like to have Jack return next year." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can come to some fair resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Werner would not directly comment on Clark's verbal attack on the organization 
-- in which he criticized the Padres for their one-year, $2.5-million offer 
with a one-year club option at about $2.5 million -- but he let it be known it 
has not soured his opinion of Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is this same guy who employs Roseanne Barr. If he can tolerate 
her antics, a little criticism from a ballplayer isn't going to faze him. 
</P>
<P>
Really, the only people who seem upset are the Padre fans, who for the second 
consecutive game booed Clark each time he was announced . . . although a crowd 
of 12,162 hardly makes it a deafening sound. 
</P>
<P>
They booed him particularly after his fifth-inning strikeout, but in a matter 
of seconds, the noise was directed toward home-plate umpire Gary Darling. 
</P>
<P>
After Clark struck out, he dropped his bat and started back to the dugout. He 
then flipped his helmet, which bounced off the feet of Giant catcher Terry 
Kennedy. And when Darling turned around, Clark fired his shin-guard onto the 
field. Darling threw him out while Clark had his back to him. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had doubled and scored in the first, went back to the bench and sat 
down. First-base umpire Bruce Froemming walked over to the dugout and motioned 
to Clark to leave the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Clark said with a few choice words, he wasn't moving. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch ran out to home plate, spoke his mind to Darling in 
the most-animated discussion he's had with an umpire this season and walked 
back to the dugout. It was only then that Clark left, taking the Padre offense 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he could be fined for throwing his bat," Riddoch said, "but not 
thrown out. We've got enough problems without worrying about the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres managed just two hits after Clark's departure, and their 4-3 lead 
began to turn into another defeat when Giant third baseman Matt Williams tied 
it with a one-out, run-scoring single in the sixth. The Giants put it away in 
the seventh while perhaps justifying their Aug. 11 decision to release pitcher 
Atlee Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants lit into their former teammate when he entered the game in relief of 
Andy Benes. Shortstop Mike Benjamin greeted him with a triple to center, and 
pinch-hitter Bill Bathe homered off him two pitches later. The Giants actually 
had a chance to hit for the cycle in the inning after Mike Kingery's single, 
but Will Clark struck out, leaving them without a double. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. The Padres weren't threatening any more anyway, losing for the ninth 
time in the past 11 games and reducing their magic number for mathematical 
elimination to 13. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the Padre front-office already has their eye on next season, 
knowing that they've certainly got enough offensive woes without attempting to 
play a season without Clark's bat. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unknown just whether they'll be able to re-sign Clark, who, with 
pending collusion damages, could be a second-look free agent at the end of the 
season. They've made their first offer, but Clark said with any more offers 
like that, he'd actually feel more respected if they just gave him the maximum 
20% pay cut to $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I don't quite understand the fans' reaction," Clark said before 
Tuesday's game. "I'm sure they look at it like, 'Hey, here's another greedy 
ballplayer.' 
</P>
<P>
"But, hey, I wasn't the one who brought up money. I'm not the one asking for a 
contract. I'm not the one saying how much I'm worth. Hell, I don't even know 
what I'm worth. Maybe I'm not worth what I'm making now. Maybe nobody is. But 
they're the ones who came to me, and I just wanted to let him know that I 
didn't appreciate the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, I can get more than that in arbitration. That didn't make any sense. 
I'm not an idiot, and am not going to sign anything that just comes my way. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I sign for will affect other guys who sign behind me. If I sign 
for what they want, it will affect a lot of other guys, and other clubs will 
come in and try to sign their guys for low figures, too. That's why I have to 
be careful. 
</P>
<P>
"But I want everyone to know this is not a personal attack on the fans of San 
Diego or the city. I like it here, and I'd like to say here. It's not like I 
came out and said, 'If you don't pay me, trade me. Play me or trade me.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I tell you what, they could have had a hell of a deal if they had taken 
care of it earlier. By everyone dragging their feet, it's just going to cost 
them that much more, especially after the collusion ruling came out. 
</P>
<P>
"There shouldn't be extensions and grace periods and this or that. Hey, this is 
the market. This is the player. Get it done, or don't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, in a goodwill gesture, have called up catcher Tom Lampkin although 
he won't be able to play in any games. Lampkin was optioned Aug. 22 to triple-A 
Las Vegas and told that he'd be back when the Padres expanded their roster 
Monday. Well, in Lampkin's first game for Las Vegas, he suffered strained 
ligaments in his right thumb on a foul tip. Not only was Lampkin out for the 
season, but the injury was going to cost him 30 days of major league service 
time. In short, Lampkin was out $16,666 that he would normally receive. But the 
Padres surprised him, telephoning him and saying they were calling him up 
anyway, cast and all. Lampkin had the cast taken off Tuesday and went right to 
work in the bullpen, wearing a splint. "I really appreciate what they did for 
me," said Lampkin, who's expecting his first child in December. "I'll do 
anything they want. The biggest thing I have to watch for is trying to do too 
much." . . . Padre producer Steve Silverman was called in Tuesday by the front 
office to discuss his comment critical of Jack Clark on a private broadcast 
line that was picked by the Padre bench during Sunday's game against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. The message sent to him was loud and clear: Keep your 
thoughts and comments to yourself. . . . The broadcasting department also is 
scrambling trying to explain the fiasco of sending Tim Flannery to Philadelphia 
for Saturday's game, only to tell him he was not needed and sending him back 
home. Total cost of the miscommunication: $3,500. And you wonder why the new 
Padre ownership is evaluating every phase of the front office. . . . The Padres 
have hit just nine homers in the past 28 games, prompting outfielder Fred Lynn 
to say: "Gee, I remember one month with Baltimore (May, 1987) when we set a 
major league record with 57 homers." . . . Although Padre outfielder Joe Carter 
is just one RBI behind Matt Williams of the Giants for the league lead, he 
certainly has had plenty more opportunities. Carter has been to the plate with 
341 men on base this season, including 243 times with runners in scoring 
position; Williams has batted with 269 men on base, 180 in scoring position.

IT'S DEJA BLUE: DODGERS LET ANOTHER BIG ONE GET AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: 7-0 LEAD TURNS INTO 10-8 DEFEAT AS DANIELS' TWO HOMERS AND ANOTHER 
CHANCE TO GAIN ON REDS ARE WASTED. ASTROS KNOCK OUT MARTINEZ.

<P>
After two innings Tuesday, the Dodgers suffered an embarrassment of riches, 
leading by seven runs with their ace, Ramon Martinez, on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
But after nine innings, Martinez and the fat lead were long gone, and the 
Dodgers were suffering their second embarrassing loss in two weeks, 10-8, to 
the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 28,939, the Dodgers were swept in the two-game 
series, wasting two home runs and six runs batted in by Kal Daniels and another 
opportunity to gain on the first-place Reds, who remain 6 1/2 games ahead 
despite losing the the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The victory allowed Houston to slip past San Diego into fourth place in the 
National League West. Al Osuna (1-0), one of six Houston pitchers who saw 
action, got his first major league victory. Jim Gott, one of six Dodger 
relievers, fell to 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray hit his 21st home run for the Dodgers in the eighth inning as they 
staged rallies in both the eighth and ninth but fell short. The Dodgers had 
only one run and four hits after their early onslaught -- a pattern similar to 
their 12-11 loss to Philadelphia on Aug. 21, when they gave up nine runs in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan on seeing one like this," said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, one 
of the few on the Dodger side able to express his feelings. "I saw one worse a 
week ago. It's very important (to come back today)." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Ken Oberkfell said coming back was even more impressive against a 
pitcher such as Martinez -- who had blown the Astros away in two previous 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the type of pitcher where if he has a seven-run lead, he's usually going 
to slam the door," Oberkfell said. "It seemed like everything we did after the 
second inning was golden." 
</P>
<P>
Astro Manager Art Howe, pleased to be moving up in the standings, noted that 
his team has eight games left against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beating good clubs now, we're moving," he said. "So we can do some more 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Astro right-hander Mark Portugal was looking for his fifth consecutive victory 
Tuesday night, but with Daniels leading two rallies, the Dodgers knocked him 
out in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
The tour of Portugal started in the first when Stan Javier singled with one out 
and Daniels followed with a home run into the right-field bullpen. Murray and 
Hubie Brooks got consecutive singles, and Murray scored on a groundout for a 
quick 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers opened the second with two singles and a walk, and before Houston 
could even get a reliever warmed up, Daniels hit a grand slam into the 
left-field pavilion, giving Martinez a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was Daniels' second multiple-homer game in three days. He hit two home runs 
Sunday in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez, following the staff's recent trend, was unable to make it through 
the fifth inning, surrendering four runs in the fourth and two more in the 
sixth. It has been five days since a Dodger starter was around for the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' fourth began placidly, with Karl Rhodes singling between two 
groundouts. But Rhodes stole second and Rich Gedman hammered a hanging curve 
into right to produce the Astros' first run. Dave Rohde followed with an 
infield single, bringing up Eric Anthony, pinch-hitting in his first appearance 
since his minor league recall. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony sent Martinez's first pitch into the right-field bullpen to make it a 
7-4 game before Martinez got out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez hastened his exit the next inning by hitting Oberkfell to open the 
fifth. Franklin Stubbs reached first when Lenny Harris bobbled a potential 
double-play ball, and Glenn Davis hit a rare drive down the right-field line 
for a two-run triple to make it 7-6. Davis was out after overrunning the base, 
and when the next batter, Rhodes, doubled, Martinez was through. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' devastating comeback was completed in the sixth off an unlucky 
Gott, who gave up the tying run on two hits and an infield out but appeared to 
be out of the inning when Stubbs lined to right. However, the drive skipped off 
Brooks' glove and rolled to the wall for a three-base error and another run 
scored, giving the Astros an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros built the lead to 9-7 in the seventh with another unusual run 
against reliever Dave Walsh. Rafael Ramirez led off with a single off shortstop 
Alfredo Griffin's glove and moved to second on a balk. 
</P>
<P>
With Gedman attempting to bunt, Walsh threw the ball in the dirt for a wild 
pitch. Catcher Mike Scioscia, apparently thinking Gedman had fouled the pitch, 
stood at home plate as Ramirez scored from second. 
</P>
<P>
Murray homered in the eighth to make it 10-8, but the Dodgers left two men on 
base in the eighth and ninth innings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels' second-inning grand slam was his second of the season and second 
of his career. By hitting home runs in his first two at-bats, Daniels recorded 
the ninth multiple-home-run game of his career and third this season. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on Tim Belcher's ailing shoulder were negative Tuesday. He threw lightly 
in the outfield and will be reexamined by Dr. Frank Jobe today. . . . Reliever 
Ray Searage threw about 50 pitches off a mound Tuesday and will be examined 
today. . . . Ramon Martinez is bidding to become the first Dodger to lead the 
National League in strikeouts since Fernando Valenzuela led in the 
strike-shortened 1981 season with 180. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan is featured in a new United Way commercial, which was unveiled at 
Dodger Stadium Tuesday on Diamond Vision. . . . Two promotions have been added 
to the Dodger schedule. Monday, Oct. 1, will be fireworks night. Wednesday, 
Oct. 3, the last regular-season game, will feature a giveaway of more than 100 
airline flights. The games Oct. 1-3 are makeups of spring lockout 
postponements.

HAVE WAC TEAMS FINALLY COME TO THEIR DEFENSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No surprise: Passing should dominate the Western Athletic Conference this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Little surprise: According to a few coaches, this shapes up as one of the WAC's 
most balanced seasons. Of course, BYU is still the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Big surprise: In a pass-happy conference, the D word -- defense -- is starting 
to creep, ever so softly, into the midst of usually offensive-minded programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're making progress on defense," said Brigham Young Coach LaVell 
Edwards. "Hawaii has always been good defensively. Wyoming is good. We have 
improved -- in the last year or two we haven't been like we had (in the past), 
but we're getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorado State is going to be getting better with Earle Bruce, and San Diego 
State -- Al Luginbill is a very good defensive coach. I think successful 
programs really have to have good defense before anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wyoming's Paul Roach: "I just don't think you're going to see big scores 
anymore. Instead of the 40s and 50s, maybe we'll see scores in the 20s and 
30s." 
</P>
<P>
 We momentarily interrupt to inform the reader that this defense talk is not a 
mistake. This is still the WAC preview. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The influx of new coaches has certainly been the biggest cause of this talk, 
talk that would have seemed heresy just a few years ago. Bruce, who came to 
Colorado State two years ago, and Luginbill, entering his second season at 
SDSU, have worked hard on their defenses, and now Ron McBride, first-year Utah 
coach, is tinkering with his defense. And over at Texas El Paso, David Lee 
hired a new defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But rest easy, high rollers. The WAC will still offer its share of eye-popping 
offensive statistics. Ty Detmer is back at BYU, Dan McGwire returns to SDSU and 
Air Force is still running the wishbone. BYU, SDSU, UTEP, New Mexico and 
Wyoming run one-back sets; Hawaii uses a combination of the wishbone and 
run-and-shoot, and Colorado State and Utah use two-back formations. All 
challenge defenses week in and week out. 
</P>
<P>
"You always see a wide variety of offenses in this conference," Edwards said. 
"There is almost as much diversity in style of play as in geography." 
</P>
<P>
Experienced BYU is the favorite, although Hawaii and Wyoming are in the upper 
echelon with the Cougars. Edwards picks Colorado State and SDSU as dark horses; 
Luginbill adds Air Force and New Mexico to that list. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone in the WAC can move the ball. Whether defense is paid more than 
lip service, we'll see. A look at the WAC, excluding SDSU: 
</P>
<P>
* AIR FORCE 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 8-4-1, 5-1-1, second 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gray, a converted halfback, will replace Dee Dowis at quarterback in Air 
Force's wishbone offense this season, which is a little like asking Burt 
Reynolds to take over for Dan Marino. Dowis was the WAC's offensive player of 
the year in 1989, finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy balloting and winding up 
with six NCAA records -- including most career yards rushing for a quarterback 
(3,612) and best one-season total (1,315). He set 21 Air Force records, and 
under his direction, the Falcons finished third in the country with 356 rushing 
yards a game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Dowis' isn't the only absence that will be felt. Air Force lost eight 
starters on offense and seven on defense from last season, including all-WAC 
picks Greg Johnson (halfback), Randle Gladney (linebacker) and Scott Hollister 
(offensive lineman). Further damage: The Falcons lost both starting wide 
receivers and four of five interior linemen. 
</P>
<P>
But second team all-WAC fullback Rodney Lewis (1,063 yards and seven touchdowns 
in 1989) is back, and DeShawn Durham rushed for 90 yards during Air Force's 
35-33 loss to Colorado State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force's wishbone offense is very difficult to defend against, especially 
once the season starts and teams basically have just one week to prepare for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
* BRIGHAM YOUNG 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 10-3, 7-1, first 
</P>
<P>
In a conference loaded with offense, none will likely surpass the production of 
BYU's. Ty Detmer is back for his junior season after throwing for 4,560 yards 
and 32 touchdowns in 1989. He finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy balloting, 
and his 175.6 passing efficiency rating was the second-highest in NCAA history. 
He broke 11 NCAA records in 1989 and was second to Heisman Trophy winner Andre 
Ware in total offense (364.42 yards per game). 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars lost Outland Trophy winner Mohammed Elewonibi, but everyone else 
returns to the offensive line, including all-WAC center Robert Stephens 
(6-feet-3, 265 pounds). It is experienced -- four seniors and three community 
college transfers -- and deep. All-American tight end Chris Smith is also back, 
as are running back Matt Bellini and wide receiver Andy Boyce. The three 
combined to catch 142 passes for 2,502 yards and 13 touchdowns in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
None of this adds up to good news for BYU's WAC rivals, because the Cougars 
finished second nationally in total offense (540 yards a game) and fourth in 
scoring (40.3) in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
So what did Edwards particularly like about last week's season-opening 30-10 
victory over Texas El Paso? The defense, specifically the pass rush and the 
fact that BYU held UTEP to 88 yards rushing in 46 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
* COLORADO STATE 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 5-5-1, 4-3, tie, fifth 
</P>
<P>
The Rams found a quarterback during Saturday's 35-33 victory at Air Force: 
Kevin Verdugo. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo replaced starter Mike Gimenez with 5:29 left in the third quarter and 
Colorado State trailing, 26-14, and promptly earned the victory. He completed 
10 of his first 11 passes and finished with 14 completions in 18 attempts for 
172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
That settled, the Rams may assert themselves as contenders if they improve in 
Bruce's second year a small percentage of as much as they did in his first. 
After going 1-10 in 1988, Colorado State improved to 5-5-1 in Bruce's first 
season. With nine offensive and eight defensive starters returning, the Rams 
expect to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tony Alford is one key. He ran for 1,035 yards last year, 
including one 310-yard effort at Utah, establishing a school and WAC record. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Colorado State's front of nose guard Eric Schaller and tackles 
Robert Chirico and Paul Hanks are back, as are linebackers Ron Martin and Steve 
Rule and backs Selwyn Jones, Harlan Carroll and Craig Jersild. They were the 
nucleus of a defense that held six of 11 opponents to 20 or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
* HAWAII 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 9-3-1, 5-2-1, third 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbows should have a pretty good idea by mid-October whether they can 
duplicate the success they had in 1989, a season that ended with Hawaii making 
its first appearance in a bowl game (a 33-13 loss to Michigan State in the 
Aloha Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
After a 28-13 loss to Texas A&amp;M Saturday, Hawaii must play three of its 
next four games on the road -- at Air Force, Utah and Texas El Paso. If the 
Rainbows get through that, they should be in pretty good shape -- they close 
with six of their last seven games at home. 
</P>
<P>
Really, there is no reason why Hawaii shouldn't expect to make another bowl 
appearance. The Rainbows have another solid defense, and quarterback Garrett 
Gabriel may be the most overlooked quarterback in the WAC. He finished second 
to Detmer in pass efficiency (143.5) and set 15 school records in 1989. Against 
Texas A&amp;M Saturday, he passed for 260 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Another key returner is running back Jamal Farmer, who set an NCAA record by 
rushing for 18 touchdowns as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
The defense suffered a blow when Delmar Johnson, one of the best returning 
defensive lineman, was injured in a motorcycle accident in San Francisco this 
summer. He underwent arthroscopic surgery and will likely redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, linebacker Mark Odom, who led the team and conference in sacks with 13 
last year, returns. Hawaii's defense was sixth in the country against the rush 
(96 yards allowed a game) and led the WAC in total defense (320 yards a game) 
and scoring defense (20.7). 
</P>
<P>
* NEW MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 2-10, 0-7, ninth 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico finished last in the WAC in 1989, but it wasn't because of its 
quarterback. Jeremy Leach passed for 622 yards against Utah, second-most in a 
game in NCAA history, and finished sixth in the nation in total offense (280 
yards a game). 
</P>
<P>
He's picking up where he left off. Saturday, in New Mexico's 29-12 victory over 
New Mexico State, he completed 24 of 43 passes for 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, two-time All-American Terance Mathis, the NCAA's all-time leading 
receiver, used up his eligibility and will not be around this season. Coach 
Mike Sheppard figures to replace Mathis with a committee, notably Eric Morgan 
(56 catches for 763 yards in 1989) and Mike Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
As for protecting Leach, All-WAC center Kurt Jensen is back, but there isn't 
much depth on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
The key to New Mexico's season may hinge on how much better its defense can 
get. Eight starters are back from a team that allowed per-game averages of 12 
fewer points and 75 fewer yards in 1989 than it did in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* TEXAS EL PASO 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 2-10, 1-7, eighth 
</P>
<P>
The Miners allowed 480 yards and 34 points a game last season, causing 
second-year Coach David Lee to hire Charley Bailey, former Memphis State coach, 
as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to line up in a three-four and multiple defenses, and Lee thinks 
things will improve this season. Still, UTEP allowed 30 points in a 
season-opening loss to BYU, and Detmer blitzed the Miner secondary for 387 
yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, UTEP has a big-play receiver in Reggie Barrett, who is on the 
verge of setting several school receiving records. He caught 58 passes for 
1,042 yards in 1989, and Lee calls him the best receiver he has ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that quarterback Howard Gasser suffered a knee injury in the BYU 
game and may be sidelined for a while. Gasser passed for 2,586 yards and 16 
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gasser's injury came on a sack, which shouldn't have been too surprising. The 
offensive line is one of the biggest concerns to UTEP coaches, having allowed 
61 sacks for 363 yards in losses last year. Gasser's injury against BYU sure 
wasn't a good start in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
* UTAH 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 4-8, 2-6, seventh 
</P>
<P>
You would think that the biggest obstacle Utah will have to overcome is the 
loss of quarterback Scott Mitchell, who passed for 3,211 yards and then 
declared himself eligible for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McBride, the new coach who replaced the fired Jim Fassel, isn't taking that 
approach. Sure, Mitchell will be missed, but McBride has worked hard in two 
areas: balancing the offense and improving the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We will still lean a little more toward the pass," he said. "But I'm looking 
to balance out the offense. Our offense needs to control the tempo of the game. 
It needs to be good in sudden change areas, and great in short-yardage 
situations. Eventually, I'd like to get us to 50% running and passing." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Woods, a transfer from Lamar, nudged Mike Richmond for the starting 
quarterback's job and completed 16 of 29 passes for 210 yards in Saturday's 
opener against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
The big news in the Utah State game, though, was the score: Utah 19, Utah State 
0. Last year, Utah finished last in the nation in defense, allowing 530 yards a 
game. That added up to a total of nearly 44 points a game allowed, and McBride 
has worked hard at finding guys who can run on defense. The shutout was Utah's 
first since the first game of the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
* WYOMING 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 5-6, 5-3, fourth 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Cowboys won back-to-back WAC championships and earned 
Holiday Bowl appearances in 1987 and 1988, this year's team may be more settled 
than any of Coach Paul Roach's previous three. 
</P>
<P>
Seven offensive and eight defensive starters are back, including quarterback 
Tom Corontzos and four of five offensive linemen. Wyoming was young last year, 
and it showed early. But the Cowboys finished strong, winning four of their 
last five games, and with a year of seasoning, they could develop into a WAC 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since Roach has been at Wyoming that he has had a 
returning quarterback, and Corontzos got off to a strong start in Saturday's 
38-23 victory over Temple, passing for 222 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest area of inexperience is at running back; their top four from last 
year graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, end Mitch Donahue is probably the best lineman in the WAC. He had 
10 sacks and eight tackles for a loss last season, totaling nearly 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule is in the Cowboys' favor. They play seven home games, the most in 
school history, including Air Force, Brigham Young and SDSU.

SCHURR COUNTING ON EXPERIENCE IN PUSH TO TOP; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: HART IS A CO-FAVORITE BUT THE INDIANS ARE UNTESTED AT THE SKILL 
POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Davis likes to point out, in his slow and methodical tone, that he was the 
first football coach hired by Schurr High. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, he's still there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what that means, but it means something," he said, laughing. 
"Either they like me or they don't feel like breaking in a new guy." 
</P>
<P>
With a break or two this season, Schurr could edge co-favorite Hart and hand 
the old guy his second Foothill League title in three seasons. And the coach 
isn't the only one in the program who has been around the block a couple of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Schurr has an edge in experience over defending champion Hart -- which has won 
or shared the league title in six of the past seven years -- especially at the 
skill positions. 
</P>
<P>
For once, somebody other than Hart would seem to have the league's best 
quarterback. Over the past five seasons, behind players such as Jim Bonds, 
Darren Renfro and Rob Westervelt, Hart's air superiority was indisputable. The 
Indians have an untested skill package, however, after losing 1989 standouts 
Westervelt (2,064 yards, 24 touchdowns) and all-purpose back Howard Blackwell 
(1,994 total yards, 32 touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Schurr quarterback Jay Macias passed for 2,133 yards and 15 
touchdowns. He threw nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Macias, all-league tailback Jun Akiike returns as does receiver 
Alfred Alvarado. In eight games, Akiike rushed for 429 yards and seven 
touchdowns. Alvarado caught 17 passes for 336 yards. 
</P>
<P>
If Macias manages just 41 completions and passes for 12 touchdowns and 844 
yards, he will eclipse school records in all three categories. What's more, 
Davis said Macias is "committed" to reclaiming the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Hart handed Schurr its lone defeat in league play last year, 35-28, at College 
of the Canyons. Macias, a three-year starter and the 1989 Foothill League Back 
of the Year, completed 16 of 26 passes for 340 yards and three touchdowns, the 
best performance of his career. This season, the game will be played at 
Montebello High, Schurr's home field, on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
While Hart's skill players are untested, the Indians' offensive line should 
protect junior quarterback Ryan Connors with a blanket of security. Returning 
are center Tim DeGroote, guard Brandon Best (6-3, 215) and tackle Eric Freund 
(6-5, 225). Tight end George Kase has the size to pass block with anybody. 
</P>
<P>
With or without newcomers, throughout the years Hart continues to roll up the 
offense. The Indians have scored 997 points under three coaches over the past 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Schurr's offensive line, while not as big, is as proven as Hart's. Dan 
Cervantes (6-1, 260), Keane Misawa (5-11, 220) and Charles Newmann (5-11, 185) 
all started last year. Danny Vargas (15 receptions, 179 yards, two touchdowns) 
returns at tight end. He was an all-league selection at defensive end as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra, which finished 5-5 under first-year Coach Gil Ruedaflores last year, 
might be the only team capable of challenging Schurr and Hart. Alhambra's 
playoff chances will depend heavily on the performances of running backs 
Russell Stanley and Phil Hughes (5-11, 190), both returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, a tailback, rushed for 923 yards in 127 carries. Hughes rushed for 334 
yards and five touchdowns. Jesse Castillo (5-10, 175), Stanley's backup last 
season, gained 652 yards in 95 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Team speed might be Burroughs' strength in its quest for a playoff berth. Of 
the 40 players out for the team, Coach Butch McElwee says a dozen can run the 
40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds or less. On the downside, only four starters 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank has converted defensive lineman Eric Arciniega into a fullback and 
part-time starter Jason Chandler returns at quarterback. Only six full- or 
part-time starters return.

CSUN LOSES DAVILA FOR THE SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SOCCER: DEFENDER SUFFERS SECOND FRACTURE IN RIGHT LEG IN AS MANY YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days after celebrating his recovery from a leg fracture by scoring the 
first and only goal in Cal State Northridge's brief Division I soccer history, 
Teddy Davila is out for the season after again sustaining a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
With two minutes remaining in Monday's 2-0 loss to UC Santa Barbara, Davila, a 
sophomore defender, collided with a Gaucho player in a race for the ball. Pain 
shot through his right shin but the former Reseda High standout did not think 
it was serious. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, as a precautionary measure, Davila was taken to Kaiser 
Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills by his brother and teammate Terry, and 
his father Tony, a CSUN assistant soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays revealed a partial break that will require a walking cast once the 
swelling goes down. It is not as serious as the multiple fracture Davila 
suffered in a game last October that restricted him to a hip-to-toe cast on his 
right leg and initially bound him to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors will check Davila for a calcium deficiency, but they don't believe that 
was the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"The break had completely healed," Davila said. "They told me it would have 
happened no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked, really," Davila said. "It stinks. I hate sitting out another 
year. Last year was probably the worst time of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard watching and now they are going on these trips to Portland 
(University of Portland on Saturday and at Oregon State on Sunday) and Indiana 
(Evansville tournament Sept. 28-30)." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Marwan Ass'ad said he immediately will request a medical redshirt 
for Davila. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take it to court if I don't get it," Davila said. "That would be 
even more disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Davila should qualify because he has appeared in only 9.5% of CSUN's matches. 
An NCAA official said that players who appear in less than 20% of their matches 
are eligible for a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so badly for the kid," Ass'ad said. "He was having so much fun. . . . 
We have so much respect and sympathy and empathy for him. We will miss him."

COLLEGE REUNION; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEAMMATES BID FOR INCREASED GLORY AT VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glory days do indeed pass most athletes by. Hometown heroics become little 
more than memories long before letterman's jackets are mothballed. 
</P>
<P>
For Tim Albrent, Tran Sanders and Chris Thomas, however, the glory days are 
past and prologue. 
</P>
<P>
The trio started and played key roles on the 1987 Ventura High football team 
that finished 10-2. It's not exactly back to the future, but now, two seasons 
later, they are hoping to reignite that excitement at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
That 1987 team won its first eight games and finished with the second-highest 
win total at Ventura High since the 1951 Southern Section Northern Division 
co-championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was a senior guard, Albrent a junior tailback and Thomas a junior free 
safety on the 1987 Ventura team. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are three great kids," Ventura High Coach Harvey Kochel said. "The team 
wouldn't have been nearly as good without them." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura College Coach Dick James says as much now. 
</P>
<P>
James calls Albrent, Sanders and Thomas "certainly the backbone of the 
offensive side of the football." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a redshirt sophomore center, Albrent a sophomore quarterback and 
Thomas a sophomore wide receiver. The coming season looms large, yet the 
remembrance of games past remains emblazoned in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about it all the time, me and Timmy and a couple of my other friends," 
Sanders said. "We'll go out some night, and we'll just start talking about high 
school football." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Ventura High connection, a parallel can be drawn between 
this season and the 1988 season, in which the Cougars were stung by graduation 
losses as well as a disappointing end to the 1987 season. In 1988, when Thomas 
and Albrent were seniors -- Sanders had graduated -- the team finished 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Ventura College lost its final four games last fall and finished 
7-4. Several key contributors from that team have departed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the trio is approaching the season with optimism. Albrent, Sanders and 
Thomas are ready to put their imprint on what they believe is a young but 
talented team. 
</P>
<P>
Albrent (6-foot-2, 205 pounds) is the link between center Sanders and wide 
receiver Thomas, on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Albrent rushed for nearly 900 yards as a tailback on the 1987 Ventura High team 
and played fullback and quarterback his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until he came to our place that we said, 'There's no more switching, 
you are the quarterback,' " said James, who has put option plays and bootlegs 
into the offensive package to take advantage of Albrent's running skills. 
</P>
<P>
Albrent started the first game at quarterback last season but played sparingly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
However, he and James spent hundreds of hours this spring and summer in the 
film room and on the field, working on the mental and physical nuances of 
playing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Albrent, who averaged 37.5 yards a kick in 1989, might be a better punter than 
a passer, but he would get a kick out of playing quarterback at a four-year 
school. He completed 16 of 40 passes for 182 yards and four touchdowns last 
fall and should have even more opportunity to prove himself this season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is described by James as Ventura's most talented player; he likely will 
be the team's most highly recruited athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to feature Chris Thomas within every means possible," James 
said. "He has got to get his hands on the ball. Chris has got to catch 50 balls 
for us. He can dominate at wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
One of only four returning starters on offense, Thomas (6-2, 175) caught 18 
passes (16.0 average), four for touchdowns. He received an All-Western State 
Conference Northern Division honorable mention as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out here catching at these practices that we've been having, I'm just 
doing a lot better than I've ever done before," Thomas said. "I hope that 
continues throughout the season." 
</P>
<P>
If the explosive Thomas is the team rocket, Sanders is the spark plug, sturdy 
and dependable. 
</P>
<P>
The center often is described as the coach on the field, a role for which 
Sanders is well-suited. After starting at guard his freshman season, Sanders 
sat out his sophomore year, not wanting to risk an injury that would jeopardize 
his planned career as a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
He spent last fall working as a junior-varsity coach at Ventura High and 
eventually cooled to the idea of becoming a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time," said Sanders, who now hopes to become a coach. "Coaching 
over at the high school helped keep me in contact with football. . . what made 
me miss it so much is seeing kids having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a transistor-sized lineman at 6-0, 228 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just out having fun this year. It's for myself," said Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders likely will face some monsters during the course of a daunting schedule 
that begins Saturday with a home game against El Camino, which finished last 
season 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a good indicator of how the season is going to be," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than a test, it's the bar exam. The regular season ends with a Nov. 
17 road game against Moorpark, which was ranked ninth in the state at 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why we couldn't have the same year we had when I was a junior or 
even better," Albrent said. "I don't see why we can't have a 10- or nine-win 
season this year."

QUARTERBACK OPTION TANTALIZES KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 6-foot-5, Kennedy High quarterback Mike McMullen is a full head taller that 
teammate Tavarus Logi. In terms of ability, however, the two stand nose to 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for quarterback is so close, in fact, that Coach Bob Francola might 
alternate the pair, something he tried while coaching quarterbacks Danny Larson 
of Birmingham and Jesse Wallace of Monroe in a recent all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
"They split series, and it didn't seem to affect the team," Francola said. "But 
I know Granada (Hills) tried it last year and it didn't work out that well." 
</P>
<P>
Both McMullen and Logi are capable starters, but they are cut from different 
cloth. Logi is more mobile and is a better rollout quarterback. McMullen is a 
pocket passer and has better field vision. During summer passing-league 
competition, the two alternated, but changing the entire offensive scheme with 
each series might prove troublesome during a real game. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Mike's a little ahead," Francola said. "I'm not sure what we'll end 
up doing. We've never had two that were neck and neck before." 
</P>
<P>
Man in the middle: His name sounds like something from a detective novel, which 
as it turns out, is oddly appropriate. Those looking for information on Sam 
Hardy's performance as a junior at Taft better bring along their sleuthing 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coach Tom Stevenson, Hardy started two games at inside linebacker 
last season before he was removed from the team for disciplinary reasons. Hardy 
is back for his senior year, however, and could be one to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"He's potentially the best player we've ever had there," said Stevenson, now in 
his sixth year. "He's a great athletic kid." 
</P>
<P>
Kid? Stevenson must be kidding. Hardy stands 6-4 and weighs 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Of the eight teams in the Northwest Valley Conference, how many 
finished with winning records in 1989? (Answer below). 
</P>
<P>
Multitalented: Royal's Tim Ross is a two-time all-Marmonte League safety, yet 
Super Prep magazine considers Ross the third-best linebacker prospect in the 
Far West. According to Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt, Ross (6-4, 205) will play 
as many as seven defensive positions this season. 
</P>
<P>
Uebelhardt said he doesn't want Ross to play only in the secondary in a league 
that traditionally is run-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's the best defensive player in the western United States, which I've 
been told, then I don't want him lining up 15 yards from the ball," Uebelhardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey out: Kris Kirksey's comeback attempt at Simi Valley ended this week 
when the former Camarillo running back decided against risking further damage 
to his injured knee. 
</P>

Kirksey, who rushed for 670 yards at Camarillo before he injured the knee 
midway through the 1988 season, missed all of last season. He transferred to 
Simi Valley and reinjured the knee while playing baseball last spring.

Increasing numbers: Fred Cuccia, who took over the Poly football program last 
August, had approximately 60 players competing for positions on the varsity and 
B team squads a year ago. This season, after a full year of recruiting 
basketball and baseball players, Cuccia has nearly 100 athletes in his program. 
</P>
<P>
"The best athletes in the school are playing football now," Cuccia said during 
a conditioning workout last week. "The lettermen liked the program last year 
and told the basketball and baseball teams about it."

GULF CRISIS MAKES GOING PUBLIC HARD TO DO, FIRMS FIND; 
</P>
<P>
MARKET: OF THE 126 COMPANIES MAKING MAJOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, 85 HAVE 
SEEN THEIR STOCK FALL BELOW THE ISSUING PRICE. 
</P>

When Advanced Logic Research Inc., a rising star in the high-end personal 
computer market, made its initial public offering of stock in April at $13 a 
share, investors quickly embraced the issue. By June, the stock hit $19.25. 
</P>
<P>
But its staying power was soon tested. With Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the 
resulting oil price rise and growing recession fears, the world's stock markets 
have tumbled. So has ALR's stock price. It closed at $9.50 Tuesday, 27% below 
its issuing price and 51% below its yearly high. 
</P>
<P>
ALR is not alone. Of the 126 companies this year making major initial public 
offerings -- those seeking to raise more than $10 million -- 85 have seen their 
stock fall below the issuing price, according to IDD Information Services, a 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a very punishing market for those IPOs that disappoint 
investors," said Patrick Graham, managing director of the corporate finance 
department at PaineWebber Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While the crisis in the Gulf has hurt all stocks, those of small, growth 
companies -- particularly those with short track records -- have been hurt 
more. And some analysts say even a quick settlement of the Iraqi crisis will 
not mean a fast recovery for companies that recently went public. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see some rocky times in the IPO market even if there's a 
resolution in the Middle East crisis, because as long as investors can't see a 
clear path for our national fiscal and monetary policies, they're not going to 
want to invest in IPOs," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Brengel, managing director in charge of IPOs at Salomon Bros. in Los 
Angeles, agreed. "Investors are looking for high liquidity in an environment of 
recessionary fears brought on by higher fuel costs," he said. "They are looking 
for companies that have gone through a variety of economic cycles." 
</P>
<P>
Until the summer's political and economic developments, the number of IPOs were 
running strong. There were 126 IPOs worth $8.17 billion during the first eight 
months of this year, compared to only 77 IPOs seeking a total of $8.18 billion 
in the same period last year, Brengel said. 
</P>
<P>
But as of Tuesday, in Orange County alone, the stocks of six of the seven firms 
to go public in 1990 are trading at or below their offering prices. And for 
some, the stock price fall has come despite good financial performances. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Wet Seal Inc., the Irvine-based retailer of young women's 
clothing, two weeks ago reported strong second-quarter earnings and an 18.6% 
increase in sales at existing outlets. But after an initial run-up in price 
from $14.25 a share to $18.25, the company's stock fell to as low as $12.25. It 
closed at $14.25 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were warned by our investment bankers before we went public that the stock 
market often has a mind of its own and outside forces will influence our stock 
price," said Wet Seal President Ken Chilvers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have companies going public this year suffered, but those that were 
preparing IPOs are now being forced to find new ways to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a number of underwriters said, several companies planning to go public 
in the fall are either re-evaluating the option or have shelved their IPO until 
market conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
Technology firms, once the darling of IPO investors, had a hard time bringing 
out new issues last year and some investor nervousness has carried over to 
1990, said Dominic Liuzzi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
To restore some of IPOs appeal, companies must settle for a lower stock price, 
Brengel said. 
</P>
<P>
Energy-related companies, as well as some retail and telecommunications firms 
that have found a niche for their products or services, have held up during the 
current market downturn, Brengel said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc., a Houston-based energy services 
company, saw its stock rise from $18.25 a share in March to $20.75 at Tuesday's 
close. The stock price of Oakland-based Safeway Inc., the grocery chain, rose 
from its IPO price of $11.25 a share in April to $14. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the general market slump spells tough times for growing companies in 
need of cash. Problems among banks and savings and loans have prompted many 
institutions to tighten their credit guidelines and be more conservative in 
their lending.

CRUDE OIL, GASOLINE PRICES UP SHARPLY; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE U.S. FUTURES MARKET COMES INTO LINE WITH FOREIGN TRADING CENTERS. 
FUEL PRICES ARE SURGING IN REACTION TO THE FAILURE OF A U.N. MEDIATION MISSION 
TO IRAQ.

Crude oil and gasoline prices surged on energy markets Tuesday as traders 
reacted with disappointment to the failure of a U.N. effort to diffuse the 
Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. markets, which were closed Monday for Labor Day, played catch-up with 
trading centers in Europe and Asia that saw sharply higher prices after U.N. 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar returned from Iraq without an 
agreement to win the release of Western hostages or the withdrawal of Iraqi 
troops from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of a barrel of West Texas 
Intermediate -- the U.S. benchmark crude oil -- for delivery in October rose 
$1.80 to close at $29.12. During periods of international calm, traders said, 
oil prices on the exchange move up or down by about 25 cents a day. 
</P>
<P>
Prices shot up "pretty much on the news that Perez de Cuellar didn't have any 
more luck than anyone else in terms of working out a diplomatic solution," said 
Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Traders expect crude oil prices to remain in the $30-a-barrel range if no major 
development alters the current standoff in the Mideast. "It's just such a 
touchy market," Bentz said. "You could come in tomorrow and find that things 
have cooled a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Traders also bid up prices of gasoline and fuel oil Tuesday. October gasoline 
rose 8.34 cents to 94.52 cents a gallon, and October heating oil gained 5.83 
cents to 82.39 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The continued increase in gasoline prices surprised many in the market. The 
demand and price for gasoline usually begins to dip in September and October 
with the end of the summer travel season. 
</P>
<P>
But some traders cited industry statistics that showed a relatively tight 
supply of gasoline inventories last month. A recent survey by the American 
Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. gasoline inventories averaged about 210.9 
million barrels during the week ended Aug. 24 -- down about 8.5 million barrels 
from the beginning of August. 
</P>
<P>
"You are looking at very low inventory levels," Bentz said. "Gasoline could 
still go a lot higher." 
</P>
<P>
A shortage of sellers has also forced buyers to bid up the price of gasoline on 
the futures markets, traders said. Daniel Uslander of Hilltop Trading, a New 
York-based futures trading firm, said many sellers stayed out of the market 
"because of the uncertainty" and are "waiting for prices to move in some 
perceived pattern." 
</P>
<P>
A prolonged pattern of gasoline price hikes could push consumers toward more 
fuel-efficient autos, according to a study released Tuesday by Integrated 
Automotive Resources of Wayne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
About 12.6% of those surveyed said that if the price of fuel reaches $1.40 a 
gallon, they would trade in their car for one that gets better mileage.

GM MAY ENLARGE SCOPE OF PLANS TO USE NATURAL GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
General Motors is weighing a $40-million proposal by California and Texas 
natural gas interests to sharply expand GM's planned mass production of trucks 
that will run on natural gas, industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of natural gas producers and utilities, including Southern 
California Gas, is negotiating with GM to launch 1994 production of four types 
of truck engines and up to a dozen types of trucks, vans and buses designed to 
burn natural gas, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear how many vehicles would be involved. But if consummated, the 
plan would suggest an increase in the scope of GM's interest in compressed 
natural gas as an alternative fuel for cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
GM wouldn't comment Tuesday on any negotiations with natural gas interests, 
except to say it doesn't expect any agreements in the immediate future. But 
sources in the natural gas industry described the general plan, which was 
confirmed by an aide to Garry Mauro, Texas land commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
It calls for GM to pay $24 million and the gas industry $16 million to engineer 
the vehicles and engines to run on natural gas. It would involve all categories 
of GM vehicles weighing more than 7,000 pounds, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000 or so natural gas-powered vehicles now on U.S. roads were converted 
from gasoline-burning fuel systems and are considered inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling cars and trucks with natural gas, which burns more cleanly than 
gasoline, is regarded as one way to meet the tough new clean-air standards 
being implemented in California and debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The natural gas industry is hoping for major commitments by GM and other auto 
companies to build natural gas-ready cars in the factory. But the auto makers 
are reluctant to spend much money on such projects until they know the final 
shape of a clean-air bill now nearing completion in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, GM, the Texas General Land Office and 10 natural gas utilities in 
California, Texas and Colorado announced in July that the auto maker would 
begin producing at least 1,000 Sierra pickup trucks in early 1991 that would be 
designed to run on natural gas. They are intended for sale to fleet customers 
-- including the utilities themselves -- that have refueling facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, GM -- which has favored methanol and so-called "reformulated" 
gasoline as solutions to the auto-emissions problem -- said the Sierra project 
was a first step in a natural gas development program. The $40-million proposal 
is the first indication of what the next steps might be. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in gasoline prices that followed the invasion of Kuwait has provoked 
additional interest in natural gas as an auto fuel. GM says it has since been 
deluged with proposals from other natural gas interests. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to have a contract in place by the first of October," a natural gas 
industry executive said Tuesday. "But if it shows up in the (news)paper, it's 
very likely that GM would cancel the program. They're that sensitive about it." 
</P>
<P>
This executive said GM does not want to lock itself in to the program until it 
sees the final shape of the clean-air legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, a GM spokesman said, the clean-air bill has nothing to do with the 
company's plans. He said none of the negotiations on natural gas projects will 
be completed by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that imminent, nor would we postpone anything because of the 
clean-air bill," said Thomas Klipstine, a spokesman for GM's truck and bus 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the GM negotiations, Jack Smith, the SoCal Gas executive in charge 
of the company's effort to peddle natural gas as an auto fuel, said, "I'm 
absolutely sworn to secrecy."

<P>
Starting immediately, cigarette vending machines will be removed. In November, 
smoking will be permitted only in designated smoking rooms and lounges. By 
April 1, 1991, smoking will be prohibited. The program is the result of an

Johnson &amp; Johnson Sues Bristol-Myers: In a lawsuit filed in federal court 
in New York, the New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical giant charged that 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s ad campaign that claims aspirin-free Excedrin is a 
better pain reliever than Johnson &amp; Johnson's extra-strength Tylenol were 
false. Because both drugs contain the same dose of the pain reliever 
acetaminophen, the products are equivalent pain relievers, said Robert Kniffin, 
Johnson &amp; Johnson's director of public relations. Bristol-Myers officials 
could not be reached for comment.

MGM Grand Air Orders Planes: The Los Angeles-based airline said it ordered two 
Boeing 757-200 long range aircraft to be delivered in the mid-1990s. The 
airline said the jets would be used for transcontinental flights, replacing the 
Douglas DC-8s that now service the Los Angeles-New York market. Charles 
Demoney, MGM Grand president and chief executive, said the DC-8s might then be 
used in charter service, or possibly for a New York-London route.

MIDEAST CRISIS IS TAKING TOLL ON ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the first signs that the Persian Gulf crisis is starting to harm the 
economy, U.S. purchasing managers reported Tuesday that manufacturing declined 
in August even as inflation surged. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Commerce Department reported construction spending on new 
homes, offices and government projects rose 0.4% during July for its first gain 
in four months. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its monthly index fell to 47% 
from 47.4% in July. 
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50% indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is 
generally declining, while one above 50% suggests it is generally expanding. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' price index soared, largely as a result of the Aug. 2 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, to its highest level since April, 1989. The inflation 
index rose to 58.2% from 50.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in crude oil and related raw materials for industry, as well as 
anticipated price hikes, boosted the index. On oil markets, the price of crude 
oil rose more than 50% in the month. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp decline in new orders in July meant lower production in August, the 
first decline in seven months. Overall production fell to 48.5% from 52.1% in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest level since January and did not augur well for September, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said spending on 
residential, non-residential and government buildings totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $442.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had said the weakness in the construction industry was due to consumer 
caution, high interest rates, tight lending requirements and, in some areas, 
overbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq made things worse," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National 
Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
Construction spending had not risen since a 0.4% increase in March. It fell 
0.9% in both May and June and 1.9% in April. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest report showed spending in May and June was even weaker than 
first reported. The department initially had said spending in May was down just 
0.3% and in June was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department reported that the productivity of American 
workers rose a revised 1.5% in the second quarter instead of 1.6% as was 
previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
The department, in a second look at the data, stood by the earlier report that 
showed there had been an increase in productivity in the three months, 
reversing a steady drop during the past 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the department reported that productivity fell 1.9%.

T-Bill Rates Sag: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of new three-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 7.39%, down from 7.49% last week. 
</P>

Another $9.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.36%, down from 7.48% last week. The rates were the lowest since 
three-month bills sold for 7.23% on Aug. 6, and six-month bills averaged 7.31% 
on Aug. 13. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 
7.64% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,813.20 and 7.75% 
for a six-month bill selling for $9,627.90. The discount rate reflects the 
price discount received when government securities are purchased at less than 
face value.

Adobe Plans New Accord With Apple: Adobe Systems, a Mountain View, Calif., firm 
that provides software for high-quality electronic printing, said it signed a 
letter of intent with Apple Computer to reach a new and expanded technology 
licensing agreement. Analysts said the move is highly positive for Adobe 
because it represents something of a rapprochement between the two companies, 
who were close allies until last year.

PEOPLE: CS 1ST BOSTON PROMOTES ARCHIBALD COX JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CS First Boston Inc. named Archibald Cox Jr. as president and chief executive 
of its Wall Street subsidiary after just four months at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, 50, succeeds John M. Hennessey, who will remain as president and chief 
executive of the parent company. James Maher, 40, was named vice chairman of 
First Boston after two years as co-head of its investment banking division. The 
changes take effect Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The shift caps a series of top management moves this year at the firm, which 
has suffered some setbacks during a securities industry slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cox was chief executive of Morgan Stanley International from 1977 to 1988, 
where he started and directed the firm's London-based international operations. 
He joined First Boston as a member of senior management in May and helped 
complete a business plan for its operating companies. 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey, 54, took over the investment bank in January, after the firm shifted 
then-Chairman William Mayer to a subsidiary to monitor its investments in 
Campeau Corp.'s troubled retailing divisions. First Boston said it had $293 
million exposed in Campeau, and the retailer's problems hurt the privately held 
investment bank's 1989 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
CS First Boston owns the subsidiaries First Boston Corp., which operates in the 
Americas; Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston in Europe and the Middle East, 
and CS First Boston Pacific in the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"These appointments will allow me to spend my time running CS First Boston," 
Hennessey said in a statement. "Now I will be able to more effectively 
coordinate the strengths of our three operating units." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, son of the former Watergate prosecutor, started his career at Morgan 
Stanley in the 1960s. From 1986 to 1988 he was a member of the Securities and 
Investment Board, which regulates the securities industry in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
First Boston went private last year when it merged with its London-based sister 
company, Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston, in a $1.1-billion deal. The 
combined entity is 45% owned by Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank holding company.

BANK BUYS DEPOSITS AT COLLAPSED S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Bank paid $101,000 on Tuesday for nearly $135 million in 
insured deposits at the failed Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, 
which was seized by regulators in February. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's two branches opened Monday as offices of the Downey-based Southern 
California Bank after the transaction was approved late Friday by federal 
regulators running the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Bank will keep Western Empire's Yorba Linda branch -- the 
thrift's original headquarters and the heart of its operation -- but will close 
the Irvine branch within a month, said Norman Morales, the bank's executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate cost to taxpayers for the S&amp;L's collapse was estimated at $24 
million by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that operates and 
liquidates failed thrifts.

CHRYSLER HIKES ITS COST-CUTTING TARGET BY $1 BILLION A YEAR

<P>
Chrysler Corp., struggling with sagging sales and high incentive costs, has 
increased its target for a cost-cutting program to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca announced plans to trim $1 billion from 
the auto maker's $26-billion yearly budget by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has cut about 2,500 of its 28,700 white-collar jobs since last 
October, spokesman Steve Harris said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cost-cutting plans were announced, executives have raised the target 
twice, first to $1.5 billion by the end of this year, and now to $2.5 billion 
by next June, Iacocca said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some tentative targets ware being talked about," Harris said. "We haven't 
formalized that yet or put the program in place. That is a tentative target 
that he (Iacocca) is looking at." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said product-development plans would be exempt from any new round of 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything having to do with the product or customer satisfaction is intact," he 
said.

'MEXICAN SCHOOL' ALUMNI TO HOLD LA HABRA REUNION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: IT HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR 40 YEARS, BUT GRADUATES OF SEGREGATED WILSON 
SCHOOL STILL REMEMBER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Estella Reynoso remembers the slap. She was in the third grade with other 
Mexican-American children from a nearby migrant camp and was one of the few who 
could speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the teacher asking me to read out loud from a book in English. I 
stumbled on a difficult word and couldn't say it. The teacher got up from her 
desk, came over to me and slapped me hard in the face," Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, we couldn't speak Spanish at Wilson School in those days, and I guess 
she got mad at me because she wanted to use me as a good example of a Mexican 
who could speak English," said Reynoso, now a 50-year-old mother of two, who 
plans to attend an unusual reunion Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1920, Wilson was nothing more than a series of weathered, 
gray-colored barracks known then as the "Mexican school." Its student body, 
almost entirely Latino, consisted of the children of Mexican farm workers who 
irrigated and picked oranges and lemons. White students went to another school. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years after the closure of Wilson Grammar School, its graduates, like 
Reynoso, who was forced to attend the racially segregated school, are holding a 
reunion at the old American Legion Hall in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's alumni have become educators, homemakers, librarians, attorneys and 
elected officials. A list of Who's Who among the graduates includes Jesus 
(Jess) Flores, who pitched professionally in the old Pacific Coast League and 
became a baseball scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates; Louis H. Zuniga, who became 
the first Mexican-American to be elected to the La Habra City Council; and Cruz 
Reynoso (no relation to Estella Reynoso), who became a state Supreme Court 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely was a segregated school," recalled Candalario Mendoza, 71, from 
Pomona, who will be recognized at the reunion as the first Mexican-American 
teacher hired in La Habra. "It was 100% Mexican, and it was comprised of mostly 
Mexican-Americans. It was a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade school and it had 
about 200 kids." 
</P>
<P>
The school was nestled near the citrus groves of the Bastanchury Ranch and near 
the Orange Packing Co., one of the largest in Orange County at that time. 
Mendoza recalled that there were about 42 students to a classroom, which were 
old Army barracks brought from the Army Air Force base in Costa Mesa to the 
school site at 2nd and California streets. Condominiums have replaced the old 
school, which has since been razed. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Zuniga, 57, who attended Wilson, said the barracks school stood in 
stark contrast to Lincoln Grammar School, the new, brick schoolhouse across 
town that opened in 1920 for the district's white students. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, Wilson was for the Mexicans and Lincoln was for the whites. It 
was truly separate and unequal," said Zuniga, who is a librarian in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, the former justice who now is in private practice, said the grammar 
school had a very "important influence" in his life. He, like many of the 
others, has bittersweet memories. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to register for school at the brick school, they told us, 'No. 
You don't go here. You have to go to Wilson.' Wilson had these wooden barracks, 
it looked very second-class to us. We asked why are we being sent to this 
school. They said, 'Because you're being sent here to learn English.' To my 
older brothers and I, it sounded suspicious. We were raised in Brea and already 
knew English." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Reynoso recalled learning about art and United States geography, and 
developing a love for education that helped carry him through college and law 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said the district promoted English under the theory that if the 
children were to ever get good jobs they would have to learn it. He agreed, in 
part, but also felt "it was a shame" that the children couldn't speak Spanish 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
When Mendoza was hired in 1942, he said, "The Mexican parents thought it was 
just great to have a teacher who could speak Spanish, while the white teaching 
staff thought I was a novelty. We were so separated from the Anglo community in 
La Habra that they probably didn't even know there was a Mexican-American 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
He found a small apartment to rent in La Habra. On his days off and after 
school, he would drive his young students around town in his 1937 blue 
Chevrolet as a reward for outstanding academic work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to them, if they read this story or that book, then I would take 
them to a movie theater or a basketball game. I was strict with them, but I 
didn't have to worry about discipline. Not after the first day," Mendoza said, 
adding that they had to sit in the rear of the theater because it was also 
segregated. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said parents would show up on the first day of school to visit him. 
They brought in small tree limbs or belts, and they would tell him in Spanish: 
"There is my son Raymundo. He is the one sitting over there in the corner. 
Here's the belt that I want you to use on him if he acts out of turn." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said the children's eyes would widen at the sight of their parents in 
class. Although corporal punishment was allowed then, he didn't have to use it, 
he said. But he did put the child's name on the belt and stuck it in a closet 
"just in case." 
</P>
<P>
Decades after Mendoza left the district, he saw a newspaper story that Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. had appointed a Cruz Reynoso to the California Supreme 
Court. So he wrote to Reynoso asking if he had attended Wilson Grammar School. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso responded that he not only had attended, but that he remembered the 
time Mendoza took the basketball team to watch a basketball game at nearby 
Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when Cruz first saw the inside of that basketball gym," Mendoza 
said. "You have to understand that these boys played basketball on hard-packed 
dirt. When Cruz saw that the college players actually wore fancy uniforms, he 
couldn't believe it. All their games were played in street clothes. It was 
quite a shock." 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Brower, now 90 and living in La Verne, was the school superintendent who 
broke the color barrier by hiring Mendoza. He did it, he said last week, 
because he believed that the children and parents deserved a teacher who could 
speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an all-Mexican school and there was prejudice against the Mexicans in 
this district," Brower said. "When Mendoza started working at that school, it 
was more than anxiety, it was prejudice." Years later, however, Brower helped 
usher in integration, which led to the closure of Wilson school in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the school was later sold to a milk company, marking an end to La 
Habra's early beginnings, Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the courts wouldn't let us have schools of just one race like that, and 
I told the board that we can get in trouble having this school. They didn't 
like what I had to say, but they agreed, and we began integrating our schools," 
Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Alfredo Zuniga's younger brother, Enrique Zuniga, 51, a school 
counselor at Fullerton College, made an interesting discovery. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Zuniga visited the school district's main office and learned that 
in 1919, the residents of La Habra had passed a $90,000 school bond to build 
Wilson and Lincoln schools. Only $15,000 was used to build their school, said 
Alfredo Zuniga, while more than $75,000 was used to construct Lincoln, which 
the white children attended. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, when we were very young, we didn't think too much about it. Now 
though, as educators we can see what we were deprived of. . . . We thought we 
were going to their schools, never our schools. Even though we were American 
citizens and were born here, we always thought we were going to their schools, 
being taught by their teachers and going to their parks. As educators, we knew 
we got a second-class education," Zuniga said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Estella Reynoso, Zuniga said he also recalled being slapped at Wilson and 
paddled like other students for getting caught speaking Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the adversity in their young lives, the alumni and their teacher 
are proud of their beginnings. It's one of the reasons they've organized the 
reunion, said Enrique Zuniga. In part, it's a social gathering. Yet, it's also 
a social statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we had 13 children in our family," Zuniga said, "and we had a one-bedroom 
house in Campo Colorado, it was house No. 69. At night it would be all bodies 
in there. We were poor, but you know, you learn something from being poor. You 
learn how to be proud."

NEW NAME: Fullerton College is modernizing its programs, so say goodby to the 
home economics division. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, it's the Division of Applied Design and Human Studies. . . 
. "A name change is all it is," says its dean, Karen Titus. "It was an image 
problem." . . . Over the last 2 1/2 years, courses were aimed away from home 
skills toward vocational training, and the new name reflects that, she says.

THE DUKE'S GRITTY IMAGE RETURNS FOR COLOR SEQUEL

The tarp was gone, along with the photographers who had come to chronicle its 
departure Tuesday. The rave reviews from the VIPS were in. And the new and 
improved John Wayne statue, after a brief hiatus in Texas for a makeover, was 
back at the airport. But Roy Hill was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
After months of waiting for this moment with his fellow airport construction 
workers -- and occasionally trying to sneak a peak before the security guards 
invariably chased them off -- the 59-year-old construction inspector simply 
shook his head in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the looks of him better before -- when he had that wear-and-tear look 
to him outside," the Wayne movie buff said as he surveyed the new Duke. "His 
face, it just doesn't look right -- the color of it." 
</P>
<P>
Four days before the public gets to make up its own mind about the new Wayne 
statue -- and $20,000 in taxpayer money spent on its renovation -- the hulking, 
nine-foot, copper sculpture was unveiled in all its "colorized" glory Tuesday 
before about 100 reporters, photographers, airport officials, county 
dignitaries and several Wayne family members. 
</P>
<P>
As the tarp that had shrouded the Duke for weeks came off, a few in the crowd 
murmured that the new version -- with its colors gently fading one into the 
next -- didn't look much different from the old. 
</P>
<P>
But publicly at least, the lobby centerpiece drew nothing but raves at the new 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal, which is due to be publicly dedicated Saturday at a 
11:30 a.m. ceremony and opened for business Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
From Melinda Wayne Munoz of Newport Beach, daughter of the screen legend: "I 
don't think it's so bad. Everyone was saying the coloring was going to be so 
bad, but it's subtle. I think it's just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
From Bruce Nott, a local real estate investor who helped raise money for the 
statue before its 1982 dedication: "Fabulous, just wonderful. I love the colors 
-- that made it. I can imagine how many photographs will be taken next to that 
over the eons." 
</P>
<P>
And the terminal's namesake, county Supervisor Riley, clasping the statue's 
hand as he posed for photographers, called the renovated statue a fitting 
tribute to a "hero" who represented a patriotism that Riley said has sometimes 
been "sorely needed in this country." 
</P>
<P>
County leaders decided to rename their airport after Wayne after the longtime 
Newport Beach resident's 1979 death from cancer. Amid considerable wrangling 
over control of the memorial, they dedicated his statue in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The old Wayne statue -- left faded, worn and a bit greened by the elements 
after eight years outside the old terminal -- was shipped to Dublin, Tex., 
earlier this year for its $20,000 retouching. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the "True Grit" star's likeness is dominated by a blend of browns, beiges 
and rustic reds, interrupted only by a few glimpses of silver on the Duke's 
cowboy boots and gun, and of gold on his bullet-lined belt. 
</P>
<P>
One key player was not present Tuesday: Robert Summers, the Texas sculptor who 
created the statue and worked on its restoration, was reportedly on an 
expedition in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Of Wayne himself, his eldest son, Michael, said: "I know that he'd have been 
very, very proud."

CITY BUDGET OKD AFTER LONG DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After months of delays, study and debate, the City Council on Tuesday finally 
passed its $218-million budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, which emphasizes a beefed-up police force to battle gang activity, 
was unveiled by City Manager David N. Ream in May, but final adoption had been 
postponed six times throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's long overdue," said Councilman Daniel E. Griset. "We've had a 
city without a budget for two months." 
</P>
<P>
Unsettled contracts with the city's police and fire unions had been the biggest 
stumbling block, with a majority of the council wanting to settle the contracts 
before passing the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Acosta, who along with Councilman Richards L. Norton voted 
against passing the budget, said approving it before settling the contracts was 
a "slap in the face" to both departments. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's $40-million budget represents approximately 40% of the 
city's general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
This money will allow for the Police Department to add 15 positions to the 
force, including six investigators for the department's narcotics unit and four 
for its gang unit. Five non-sworn officers will be added to allow officers more 
time to patrol the street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a beefed-up police force, the budget also emphasizes an effort 
to clean up the city's neighborhoods, providing $3.7 million to be spent on 
such improvements as street repair and tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
A total of $34.8 million has been budgeted for capital improvements, which 
include not only the neighborhood work but also the resurfacing of major 
thoroughfares, new traffic signals, park improvements and a library renovation 
and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
These projects had to be placed on hold until the budget was passed, Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana was the only city in Orange County operating without a budget, with 
Westminster adopting one just last week. GREG HERNANDEZ

366 DRUNK-DRIVING SUSPECTS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County law enforcement authorities, armed with a tougher legal standard 
for drunkenness, arrested at least 366 people on suspicion of driving while 
under the influence of alcohol over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed on the county's freeways during the long weekend in 
two traffic accidents that the California Highway Patrol said involved drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
There were scores of minor alcohol-related traffic accidents reported 
throughout the county between 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP's three Orange County bureaus reported that 167 motorists were arrested 
for driving while under the influence of alcohol on the county's freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, CHP officers reported 59 arrests, more than double the number 
the station made last Labor Day weekend, and the most arrests over a three-day 
weekend in years, CHP Officer Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten attributed much of the increase in arrests to more vigorous enforcement 
and a new law that lowered the legal standard for drunkenness to a a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.08%. The previous standard was 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten said 9% of the Labor Day weekend arrests were of persons who met the 
lower standard. "They would have driven away last year," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten also said, however, that it appears that more people are drinking and 
driving, despite heavy advertising campaigns aimed to discourage the illegal 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Drunks are out there killing innocent people," Whitten said. "That's the 
reason we are putting so much emphasis on drunk driving. (But) you'd think DUI 
would be reduced, not increased, because of enhanced enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Angel Johnson said the Santa Ana office arrested 63 motorists 
suspected of driving under the influence, five less than last year. 
</P>
<P>
And CHP Officer Ken Daily said officers stationed in the San Juan Capistrano 
office made 45 DUI arrests, compared to 25 last Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Police in two cities -- Laguna Beach and Brea -- set up one-day sobriety 
checks, making 32 drunk-driving arrests over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great weekend," Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Raymond Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department and the Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and 
Huntington Beach police departments each reported making more than 15 DUI 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Irvine, La Habra, 
La Palma, Placentia, Seal Beach, San Clemente, Tustin and Westminster all 
reported arresting fewer than 10 drivers suspected of being drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty low considering there was special enforcement out," Garden Grove 
Police Lt. Ron Weigand said. "People were obviously acting good." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana and Orange police officials said they were unable to provide the 
number of DUI arrests made in their cities over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The only city that reported making no arrests of drunk-driving suspects was Los 
Alamitos.

SPECIAL BUS OFFERED FOR COMMUTE HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to reduce traffic congestion caused by construction on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, the Orange County Transport District on Tuesday started a special bus 
route for commute-hour travelers between San Juan Capistrano and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The first 19-seat passenger van left the Junipero Serra Road Park-and-Ride 
station in San Juan Capistrano at 5:31 a.m. It arrived in Anaheim 80 minutes 
later, after making scheduled stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The number of commuters using the service Tuesday was not immediately 
available, but OCTD officials are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope some motorists will seize this opportunity and leave their cars at 
home," OCTD spokeswoman Mona Ziada said. "Everyone benefits -- they don't have 
to drive through the congestion, and they help to free up traffic." 
</P>
<P>
To encourage commuters to use the new route, OCTD is offering free rides during 
the first two weeks of service. From Sept. 17, commuters will pay $1.80 for the 
Anaheim-San Juan Capistrano run and $1.30 for either Anaheim-Laguna Hills or 
Anaheim-Irvine. Transfers to connecting OCTD routes are free. 
</P>
<P>
Ziada said the district had signed a $82,746 contract for the Yellow Cab Co. to 
operate the new route. 
</P>
<P>
The service includes four morning trips leaving the South County station at 
30-minute intervals. The first of four return trips leave the Anaheim station 
at Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard at 4:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has agreed to pay 50% of the costs as part of an agreement between the 
state agency and OCTD. The agreement calls for the district to provide 
ride-sharing programs during the freeway reconstruction, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziada said the district is almost certain to make the route permanent, even 
after construction work on the freeway is completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Bus Route 
</P>
<P>
The first express bus linking San Juan Capistrano to Anaheim will run, with 
stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange. The buses will leave every 30 
minutes.

SCENIC HILLSIDE TO STAY AS IS, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday reassured South Laguna residents that it would not 
allow development of a scenic, 235-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they had received anonymous flyers warning that the 
council would be opening the hillside for development. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city had been unable to negotiate a 
purchase price for the land, known as the Esslinger Trust property and located 
in Hobo Canyon, and that the council had specifically decided not to take the 
issue to court. But he reassured the residents that the city would pursue 
negotiations. The council also attempted to pacify the residents by voting to 
set aside $1 million in state money for land purchases other than in Laguna 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Tuesday evening, the council agreed to spend $350,000 to repair 
a bluff in Heisler Park. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to construct a rock revetment to prevent further erosion 
of the bluff where a major landslide occurred several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council urged the staff to ensure that the revetment be built as 
close to the bluff as possible so that it will not intrude in the tidal area. 
</P>
<P>
This alternative may also allow for the construction of a bridge or the 
reconstruction of a 20-foot stretch of sidewalk overlooking the ocean near 
Jasime Street and Cliff Drive that slid two to three feet toward the ocean 
several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant and city staff members concluded that the shuffle board area near 
the sidewalk was in danger of being lost if repairs were not made. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the rock revetment, the council rejected other alternatives such as 
construction of a seawall or installing caissons to buttress the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have estimated that the bluff has eroded 5 to 10 feet during the 
last 40 years. GEBE MARTINEZ

<P>
Two men were arrested Tuesday after they led police on a chase at speeds of up 
to 120 m.p.h. that ended in Irvine in a fight with police and the destruction 
of their sports car. 
</P>
<P>
Masaaki Tachiki, 22, and Kinichi Nikashimi, 19, both of Northridge, were 
arrested at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday and booked into Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of evading arrest and assaulting two police officers, California 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the men were spotted by two CHP officers at 1:15 a.m., speeding 
southbound along the San Diego Freeway near the Euclid Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The officers gave chase. As the car neared heavy traffic, the driver veered the 
Pontiac Trans Am sports car onto the right shoulder to pass the slower-moving 
cars. The two men got off the freeway at Irvine Center Drive, and the car spun 
out of control, Johnson said. When the officers pulled up behind the stopped 
car, the men jumped out of the Trans Am and started to fight the officers but 
were subdued, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, while the four stood outside the parked cars, the Trans Am burst into 
flames.JAMES M. GOMEZ

EMBATTLED SURROGATE MOTHER ADMITS WELFARE FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: OFFICIALS SAID ANNA JOHNSON'S CASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF 'OVERSIGHT,' 
SO THE JUDGE REDUCED THE FELONY CHARGES TO MISDEMEANORS AND GAVE HER PROBATION.

<P>
Anna L. Johnson, the surrogate mother who has drawn national attention in her 
legal battle to keep the child she is carrying for another couple, pleaded 
guilty Tuesday to unrelated welfare fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
A judge reduced the charges from felonies to misdemeanors after welfare 
officials said the case could well have been one of "oversight." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in court, Johnson, 29, admitted that she collected $4,600 too much in 
food stamps and aid to families with dependent children while she was working 
at two nursing jobs last year. She pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of 
welfare fraud, was placed on probation and ordered to perform community 
service. She has repaid all the money. 
</P>
<P>
The couple who hired Johnson to bear their child for $10,000 said her skirmish 
with the law shows that she is not trustworthy and that her claim for custody 
of their son, who is due to be born in mid-October, should be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think that's the kind of environment our son should be raised 
in," Mark Calvert said. "I think it shows the true nature and personality of 
Anna Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert, said the welfare fraud case "has nothing 
to do with the custody case." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a licensed vocational nurse, contends that she should keep the baby 
because the Calverts would make unfit parents. She says the Calverts do not 
love their child and have demonstrated it by making support payments late and 
failing to adequately care for Johnson. The Calverts have countered that they 
did everything they could for Johnson, including making their payments early, 
and that her threats to keep the baby are designed to get publicity and more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
In a potentially precedent-setting lawsuit filed on Aug. 13, Johnson asks the 
court to declare her the baby's biological mother, even though she has no 
genetic link to the child, and award her custody. Most disputed surrogation 
cases involve a birth mother whose own egg was used, so she is the baby's 
biological mother. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a single mother of a 3-year-old daughter, began receiving AFDC and 
food stamps in 1988 but neglected to report to the Orange County Social 
Services Agency when she began earning more money. That information would 
probably have resulted in a reduction of her public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will not have to serve any jail time. In exchange for her guilty plea, 
Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas put Johnson on probation for three years 
and ordered her to perform 150 hours of community service. As a condition of 
her plea, he requested -- and got -- proof that Johnson had repaid the $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
The two fraud counts were originally filed as felonies, carrying a combined 
maximum prison term of three years and eight months. But Cardenas reduced them 
to misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said it is "highly unusual" to see a case that warrants a reduction 
from felony to misdemeanor charges even before a defendant completes the 
probation period. But in Johnson's case, he said, such a reduction was 
justified by three factors: Johnson's lack of a previous criminal record, her 
promise to repay the money, and indications from welfare officials that they 
considered the case one of "oversight."

COSTA MESA COUNCIL REJECTS BAN ON PUSHCARTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: STRICTER REGULATIONS AND SANCTIONS ARE NEEDED, ONE MEMBER AGREES, BUT 
SAYS REMOVING THEM FROM CITY STREETS IS 'SLIGHTLY FASCIST.'

<P>
Calling the measure overkill, the City Council on Tuesday rejected a proposed 
ordinance that would have banned pushcart vendors from city streets. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, with Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed Glasgow dissenting, the 
council directed the city attorney to prepare a substitute ordinance that would 
place more restrictions on street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have heard here is that pushcart vendors are a problem because they 
don't have the permits they are supposed to have, which makes them illegal, 
which makes them a nuisance," said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis. 
</P>
<P>
"We need proper sanctions and more regulations, but to ban them outright is 
slightly fascist." 
</P>
<P>
City officials had maintained that the vendors, mostly Latinos who sell ice 
cream, snow cones and other food items, are a threat to the public's health and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of your children bought an item from a vendor that was not approved 
from the health department and got food poisoning, you would probably have 
second feelings about this," Amburgey said. "If council members took the 
opportunity to inspect these vendors, they would be alarmed at the unsanitary 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
During one 10-day period in August, police cited 14 vendors for operating 
without a business license or health permit and eight others for soliciting 
without a permit, according to code enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have received numerous complaints from residents about 
vendors going door to door, causing children to run across busy streets, and, 
in some cases, purposely giving incorrect amounts of change to children after 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
According to a staff report, a recent investigation by the county Health Care 
Agency found that one Costa Mesa vendor was operating an ice cream business 
from an unapproved industrial warehouse in another city that was also being 
used for living quarters. The county confiscated and destroyed 850 pounds of 
food and 27 pushcarts found behind the warehouse and arrested seven employees. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Houston, assistant director of the Health Care Agency's division of 
environmental health, said unauthorized street vendors pose a growing problem 
in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
The county enforces state laws that impose some structural and operational 
requirements on food trucks and pushcarts, requiring an overall clean, healthy 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The cart has to be kept clean and in good repair and the food must be labeled 
and come from an approved source," Houston said. "It has become a difficult 
enforcement activity because of its mobile nature and has led to more and more 
cities . . . regulating or banning the activity." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at least three other communities -- Anaheim, Newport Beach and Brea -- 
already ban pushcart vendors on city streets. And a Santa Ana official said 
that city, because of complaints, is reevaluating its current vendor law, which 
requires a health permit and business license. 
</P>
<P>
Although Amburgey and other city officials maintained that the ordinance is not 
aimed at Latinos, many critics argued that it would have had a discriminatory 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, citing the 
spate of recent controversial actions undertaken by the city to deal with 
illegal immigrants, agreed that the ordinance appeared to be aimed at Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that vendors in the city are already required to obtain a city 
business license and a county health permit. 
</P>
<P>
Under new regulations to be considered by the council, pushcart vendors would 
be required to display city business licenses, health permits and photo 
identifications, and would face fines for carts found to be in violation of 
regulations. The city could also confiscate or impound illegal carts.

THE PLAYERS: WHO'S WHO AMONG THE BEST IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's batch of top high school football players in Orange County has 
plenty of quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers. You can't miss them. 
</P>
<P>
They're the guys who scramble left and right behind the line, then complete 
50-yard passes. The guys who break three, four, five tackles for that crucial 
first down. The guys who make diving catches in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But before we get to all that junk, here's the guys who do the dirty work. The 
young men down in the trenches. The fellows who block, tackle and snarl. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP FIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
Mike Burns, senior, linebacker (Esperanza) -- Big, strong and fast, which 
coaches tend to like in a linebacker. Burns is 6 feet 3, 235 pounds but runs 
4.6 in the 40-yard dash. He started five games at outside linebacker as a 
junior. He had three sacks and forced one fumble in the season opener against 
Santa Ana. Burns then moved to inside linebacker at the start of Empire League 
play, but tore ligaments in his ankle midway through the second quarter and 
missed the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hogue, senior, defensive tackle (El Toro) -- Another in a long line of 
great linemen at El Toro. He was a second-team all -- South Coast League 
selection last season and has beefed up to 255 pounds on his 6-4 frame. He also 
has the ability to play from sideline-to-sideline, according to Charger 
coaches. Hogue plays on the El Toro basketball team, a testament to his ability 
to move quickly with his size. A 4.0 student, he was elected one of the 
Chargers' captains this season. 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Olsen, senior, linebacker (Fullerton) -- A 6-1, 220-pound physical player, 
who also has good speed. He was a first-team all-Freeway League selection last 
season. Besides being a standout in football, Olsen is one of the best baseball 
players in the county. Last season, he set a county record for home runs with 
13. He also led the county in runs batted in (39), runs (42), hits (50) and 
doubles (13). Played guard last season for the Indian football team, but will 
move to fullback this season. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pearsall, senior, defensive tackle (Villa Park) -- A second-team all -- 
Orange County selection last season. A key member of a defense that held four 
teams to fewer than 10 points. Pearsall has added weight and is now 6-3, 235. 
He also has good speed, in fact Coach Pat Mahoney said he considered moving 
Pearsall to defensive end. Mahoney also calls him the key to the Spartan 
defense. Pearsall was selected as a team captain for the second consecutive 
year. He also will play offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Schroller, senior, offensive tackle (Fountain Valley) -- If nothing else, 
college recruiters are impressed with Schroller's size (6-7, 280). But he can 
also play. Schroller is strong; he power-cleans 275 pounds and bench presses 
300. He has also been clocked at 5.05 in the 40. Quiet off the field, but has a 
nasty disposition on it, according to Baron Coach Mike Milner. He didn't play 
football until his sophomore season, but has learned the game quickly. Will 
become an even better player in college, Milner says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP FIVE SKILL PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
LaQuan Beckton, senior, running back (Los Alamitos) -- Missed three games 
because of an injured ankle and played in the shadow of Erik Mitchell 
(Colorado), who gained more than 1,000 yards. However, Beckton still had his 
moments. He had one 100-yard game and finished with more than 400 yards and 
scored five touchdowns. Beckton will be the official point of the running game 
this season. At 5-9, 200, he has the size to run over would-be tacklers, but he 
is fast enough to run past them. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Cashman, senior, wide receiver (Los Alamitos) -- One of the most 
versatile players in the county. He has the speed to play wide receiver and the 
size (6-4, 205) to play tight end. He is also the team's punter. Coach John 
Barnes said Cashman can place kick and also would be a good quarterback. Last 
season, he caught 45 passes for 823 yards and seven touchdowns. Besides his 
ability as a receiver, Barnes said Cashman is a solid blocker and a team 
leader. A first-team all-Empire League selection in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson, senior, quarterback (El Toro) -- An all-Orange County selection at 
wide receiver last season. He also backed up quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who 
is at Stanford. Johnson played at quarterback on the freshman and sophomore 
teams and led the sophomore team to a 9-1 record in 1988. He is the son of El 
Toro Coach Bob Johnson and brother of Bret Johnson, who led the Chargers to two 
Southern Section championships. Johnson, who is 6-4, 205, has a strong arm and 
good speed. Last season, he caught 60 passes for 1,300 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Saunders, senior, running back (Foothill) -- The leading rusher in the 
Century League last season with 846 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. He 
isn't the biggest back (5-9, 175) or the fastest (4.75 in the 40), but he's a 
hard runner and durable. Saunders gained 153 yards against University and 131 
yards against Irvine. Coach Marty McWhinney said Saunders will carry the ball 
even more this season. Saunders worked with a running coach during the 
off-season and lowered his time in the 40 from 5.0 to 4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Solliday, senior, quarterback (Capistrano Valley) -- He already has shown 
why he is among the best. He completed 15 of 23 passes for 221 yards and three 
touchdowns in the Cougars' 29-15 victory over Honolulu Damien last week. In 
1989, Solliday completed 151 of 249 passes for 2,377 yards and 20 touchdowns. 
In the Southern Section Division III semifinals against Paramount, Solliday led 
the Cougars on a 63-yard touchdown drive that tied the game, 21-21, with 21 
seconds left. He completed six of seven passes for 53 yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT FIVE 
</P>
<P>
David Ackerman, senior, offensive tackle (Foothill) -- One of the main reasons 
Sean Saunders will gain more than 1,000 yards this season. McWhinney said 
Ackerman worked overtime in the weight room during the off-season and is now 
6-1, 240, up 10 pounds from last season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Brion, senior, defensive back/running back (Capistrano Valley) -- Might 
be the best defensive back in the county. He intercepted three passes in the 
Cougars' victory over Honolulu Damien last week, matching his season total from 
1989. Against Damien, he gained 58 rushing yards in 10 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Ford, senior, tight end/linebacker (Trabuco Hills) -- A blue-chip 
recruit at either position. He caught 34 passes for 595 yards and six 
touchdowns last season. In two years on the varsity, he has caught 17 touchdown 
passes. Ford also has the size (6-3, 215), speed and ferocity to play 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Haas, senior, linebacker/tight end (El Toro) -- A first-team all-South 
Coast League selection last season. He played mostly on defense in 1989, but 
did catch a crucial touchdown pass in the Chargers' regular-season victory over 
Mission Viejo. Haas has good speed and size (6-2, 217). 
</P>
<P>
Todd Kehrli, junior, quarterback (Corona del Mar) -- Led the Sea Kings to the 
Division VI championship as a sophomore. Even though Corona del Mar relied more 
on its defense and running attack, Kehrli still completed 122 of 254 passes for 
1,662 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000-YARD CLUB 
</P>
<P>
Visko Ancich, senior (Tustin) -- A tough, tackle-to-tackle runner. He gained 
633 yards last season and averaged 5.1 yards per carry with eight touchdowns. 
Also a good receiver, led the team in receptions the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Gerrick Emry, junior (Esperanza) -- The Aztecs traditionally have a good 
offensive line and someone has to benefit. This year it will be Emery who has 
speed (10.0 in 100 yards) and size (6-1, 200). 
</P>
<P>
Ron Goods, senior (Tustin) -- Sure, Ancich will get 1,000 yards but Goods will 
be right there too. A perfect complement to his running mate, Goods has been 
clocked at 4.55 in 40. He gained more than 338 yards last season, but had to 
share time with Kelvin Love, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Ireland, senior (Santa Margarita) -- Gained 1,080 yards and averaged 7.7 
yards per carry in 1989. With the Eagles' weak free-lance schedule, he should 
easily match those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Overby, senior (Sunny Hills) -- Gained more than 900 yards last season as 
the Lancers' No. 2 back. Good speed and a strong runner who is out of the 
shadow of Brian Pizula, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Remmel, senior (Orange) -- The focal point of the Panther offense a year 
ago. He gained more than 1,300 yards and led Orange into the Division VIII 
playoffs. May get the ball less because of the return of tailback Acen Childs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sullivan, senior (Sunny Hills) -- Same situation as Tustin, but the 
Lancers nearly had two 1,000-yard rushers last season. Sullivan played wingback 
last season, but still gained 558 yards rushing and averaged 8.5 yards per 
carry. He is faster than Overby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MR. VERSATILE 
</P>
<P>
Randy Karliner, senior, quarterback/linebacker/punter (Ocean View) -- The hopes 
of the Seahawks pretty much rest with Karliner. He led Ocean View to a 7-4 
record and the Sunset League co-championship. Karliner passed for 1,356 yards 
and 14 touchdowns, and was also the team's second-leading rusher. On defense, 
he is the team's best linebacker and averaged nearly 40 yards per punt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE BACK 
</P>
<P>
Acen Childs, senior, tailback (Orange) -- He had more than 300 yards after the 
Panthers' first two games then injured his knee. Childs isn't the biggest 
player around (5-9, 160), but has good speed. With Remmel, he should give the 
Panthers a potent running game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cunningham, senior, wide receiver/defensive back (Edison) -- He had 13 
receptions for 270 yards and five touchdowns when he broke his thumb. He missed 
four games, but still led the team in interceptions with four. A versatile 
athlete who can play quarterback if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Rooker, senior, running back (Trabuco Hills) -- When healthy, he could be 
the best running back in Orange County. But he has played only parts of two 
season because of knee, ankle and groin injuries. Rooker, who is 6-3, 225, 
gained 459 yards and averaged 7.1 yards per carry in five regular-season games 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Singletary, senior, quarterback/linebacker (Rancho Alamitos) -- He was 
considered dangerous on both sides of the ball, but broke his leg in two places 
during the first game of the season. Singletary spent six months in a cast, but 
is 100% recovered. At 6-1, 225, will likely play linebacker in college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE GONE 
</P>
<P>
Danny Maestas, senior, running back (El Toro) -- He scored 10 touchdowns last 
season and was projected as the team's starting tailback. However, he injured 
his knee during summer workouts and is out three to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Adams, senior, running back (Capistrano Valley) -- He was supposed to be 
the replacement for 1,000-yard rusher Paul Shaheen. However, Adams injured his 
back during summer workouts and is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TRANSFERS 
</P>
<P>
Casey Sullivan, senior, quarterback (Laguna Hills) -- He threw for 1,430 yards 
and 12 touchdowns last season for St. Monica. Sullivan will give the Hawks a 
strong passing attack to go with a good running game. 
</P>
<P>
Shad Vickers, senior, defensive back/running back, (Tustin) -- Gee, just what 
the Tillers needed, another good running back. Vickers gained 787 yards and 
scored six touchdowns last season for Irvine. Because of Ancich and Goods, 
Vickers will play mostly on defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SLEEPER 
</P>
<P>
Donnell Dowdy, junior, defensive back/quarterback (University) -- Last season, 
Dowdy intercepted six passes -- second-best in the county -- and returned three 
for touchdowns. He was a first-team all-Southern Section selection even though 
the Trojans had a 2-8 record. Dowdy, who is 6-3, 205, will also play at 
quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TOE 
</P>
<P>
Josh Klein, senior, (Newport Harbor) -- The best kicker in the county. He made 
12 field goals, nine of which were longer than 30 yards. Klein, who is also an 
outstanding soccer goalie, had one field goal of 45 yards and another of 44.

THE TEAMS: EL TORO IS TOPS, BUT SEVERAL OTHERS COULD SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, El Toro High School's football team took its first step toward 
an undefeated season by scoring two touchdowns in the final four minutes to 
defeat Whitehall, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
When El Toro completed its perfect season 14 weeks later by beating Santa Ana 
in the Division III championship game, Coach Bob Johnson looked back to the 
season-opening victory as the key. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a storybook trip for nine days and a storybook victory with two 
touchdowns in the last four minutes," he said. "We often referred to that game 
during the season. A certain charisma was established that carried through the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
It marked the last time a county school went 14-0 and Johnson admitted the 
prospects of going undefeated are "once in a lifetime." Is it? Could El Toro 
relive the dream four years later? 
</P>
<P>
Although predicting an undefeated season for El Toro is foolish, there are some 
similarities between this year's team and the 1986 squad that certainly point 
toward another banner season. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, El Toro has returned to Pennsylvania, where it will play Wyoming 
Valley West in its season opener Friday. The starting quarterbacks have the 
same last name. This year's starter is Rob Johnson, younger brother Bret 
Johnson, who helped the Chargers averaged 39.3 points per game in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro has moved wide receiver Bret Sanders to tailback after returning 
starter Danny Maestas suffered a knee injury in practice last week. Maestas 
will miss three to five weeks with the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, starting tailback Ron Chocklet suffered a stress fracture in 
his right leg and an unheralded substitute, Aly Diaz, stepped into the starting 
lineup and rushed for 1,525 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The '86 team featured a linebacker, Scott Ross (now at USC), and a defensive 
tackle, Scott Spalding (UCLA), who helped hold 14 opponents to an average of 
11.1 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
This year's defensive standouts are tackle Jeremy Hogue and linebacker Brian 
Haas. Both are listed in most preseason publications as can't-miss Division I 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, the county's most successful team in the '80s with three division 
titles and six league championships, opens the '90s as the top-ranked team in 
The Times' Orange County preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, just winning the South Coast League championship will be a major 
achievement. Two league members, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo, are 
ranked among the top five in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Winning a title in the revised Division II playoffs won't be easy, either. 
Seven teams in the division -- Mission Viejo, Capistrano Valley, El Toro, 
Paramount, Muir, Santa Barbara and Thousand Oaks -- advanced to the semifinals 
in postseason play last year. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a weakness at El Toro, it's at wide receiver after Johnson moved to 
quarterback and Sanders to tailback. But for openers, El Toro is clearly the 
county's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the best of the rest: 
</P>
<P>
2. CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tony Solliday was hotter than the 107-degree artificial surface in 
Aloha Stadium last week, passing for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 29-15 
victory over Honolulu Damien. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday was named to the Cal-Hi Sports all-underclassmen team after passing 
for 2,377 yards and 20 touchdowns last year. Capistrano Valley's offense 
appears to be more formidable than last year when it swept past 10 opponents to 
become the county's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver David Poltl showed in last week's game that he's bigger, stronger 
and faster; he caught five passes for 48 yards and a touchdown. Free 
safety-running back Jeremy Brion had three interceptions and 58 yards rushing 
in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The only question is the offensive line, but Solliday said he had plenty of 
time to pass and threw to six receivers in Honolulu. "I think our offense is 
going to be better than last year's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
3. ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
Keith McDonald, the best quarterback this side of the South Coast League, 
returns for his third season. "Keith will throw about 20 times a game," says 
Coach Gary Meek. 
</P>
<P>
A bold statement coming from a coach who has used an I-formation, pro set, and, 
finally, the Delaware Wing-T in three mediocre seasons. Meek has settled on the 
Wing-T and said he expects running backs Mark Parlin and Gerrick Emry to have 
big seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mike Burns has recovered from torn ligaments in his ankle and should 
develop into an all-county player. Tight end Reid Pullen was most impressive 
while catching three touchdown passes against Los Alamitos last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to score some points," Meek said. Esperanza will also be looking 
to settle the score with Los Alamitos after losing to the Griffins five 
straight years. 
</P>
<P>
4. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
Three top 10 teams -- Capistrano Valley, Edison and Tustin -- played in Hawaii 
last week, and Tustin was clearly the best prepared. The Tillers practiced for 
six days at Camp Mokuleia, a rustic church retreat on one of the northern-most 
locations in Oahu, and the Spartan lifestyle seemed to agree with the players. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin looked sharp in a 37-7 victory over Pac-5. Tailback Ron Goods is the 
quickest player Coach Marijon Ancich has coached in five years at Tustin. Goods 
averaged 10.6 yards per carry against Pac-5. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich's son, Visko, is a versatile running back who also plays linebacker and 
holds on extra points and field-goal attempts. Visko isn't flashy, but he is 
solid in every aspect of the game. The same can be said for returning 
quarterback Andy Borza. 
</P>
<P>
5. MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
<P>
Few can match Mission Viejo's streak of qualifying for the playoffs 13 straight 
years. But fewer still can match the Diablos' mark of having lost in the 
semifinals in postseason play in five of the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
One positive note from last year's semifinal loss to El Toro: Mission Viejo 
quarterback Tim Snowden outplayed the county's best quarterback, Steve 
Stenstrom. Snowden, who returns for his senior year, passed for 352 yards to 
Stenstrom's 178. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Mike Boucher, a big target at 6 feet 4, 195 pounds, teams with 
Doug Roberson to give Mission Viejo two excellent receivers. "We should have an 
explosive offense," said Mission Viejo Coach Mike Rush. 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Bill Denny, a three-year starter, is the best at his position in 
the county. Denny intercepted three passes last year and returned two of them 
for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
6. LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins have a 52-9 record over the past five years and have won 20 
consecutive Empire League games. Quarterback Todd Gragnano, running back Erik 
Mitchell and receiver Chad Millan, the heart of the team's high-octane offense, 
have graduated. But there are some equally effective weapons still in place. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback LaQuan Beckton, who played in Mitchell's shadow last year, has grown 
to 200 pounds and is anticipating a big season. Split end Tyler Cashman is on 
the shopping list of every major college. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Barnes is predicting that John Collins will be the school's next 
outstanding quarterback, following in the footsteps of J.T. Snow, Tom 
Williamson and Gragnano. "He looked awfully good this summer," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
7. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, under first-year Coach Bruce Rollinson, the Monarchs won seven of 
its last eight games after opening the year with three losses. Quarterback 
Danny O'Neil, running back Kealii Clifford and wide receiver Tino Chavez were 
among the county's best players at their respective positions. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the defense is expected to keep the Monarchs in contention for the 
Angelus League title. Nine starters, including team MVP Mike Silvey at 
linebacker, return on defense. 
</P>
<P>
8. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Josh Gingrich hasn't made anyone forget graduated quarterback Donnie Smith, and 
J.R. Schusterick will have a tough time equaling the performance of Shane 
Sherman at running back. But the Chargers' defense looked strong in a 12-0 
victory over Honolulu Iolani last week. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's typically small but quick linemen recorded five sacks and the 
secondary intercepted three passes. Danny Steinle, making his first start at 
linebacker, was particularly impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The standout of the team is wide receiver-free safety Mike Cunningham, who 
caught six passes for 77 yards and returned four punts for 55 yards last week. 
</P>
<P>
9. TROY 
</P>
<P>
After qualifying for the playoffs the past six seasons, could this be the year 
Coach John Turek wins a league title? It's likely to be a championship season 
with the pass-catch combination of quarterback Greg Windle and wide receiver 
Steve Friedrich returning. 
</P>
<P>
Windle passed for 1,475 yards as a junior and Friedrich caught 36 passes for 
633 yards. Fullback Chad Brasington, who scored nine touchdowns, also returns, 
as does 255-pound offensive tackle Jeff Dorsz. 
</P>
<P>
10. SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pizula, the league's most valuable player, has graduated but the Lancers 
return two of last year's terrific trio in the backfield. Kenny Overby and 
speedy Mike Sullivan should more than pick up the slack for Pizula. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills had won 12 consecutive games going into the Division VI semifinals, 
where it was shut out by eventual champion Corona del Mar. Quarterback Jamal 
McKenzie is listed in several scouting publications, but the future projections 
are based more on his size (6-2, 195) than his passing ability. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Corona del Mar, Orange, Pacifica, Rancho Alamitos, Santa Ana, 
Trabuco Hills, Valencia and Villa Park.

Dino Andino of San Clemente, the current leader on the Professional Surfing 
Assn. of America Tour, will be among the 256 surfers competing at the $100,000 
Body Glove competition this week at Lower Trestles at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The competition began Tuesday with trial rounds and continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Andino, who finished second overall on the tour the last two years, leads 
second-place Charlie Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., 5,350 points to 4,743 in the 
overall standings. Only three stops remain on the 11-event tour. 
</P>
<P>
Andino is coming off consecutive second-place finishes at the Laguna Sportswear 
contest at Salt Creek Beach and the Malibu competition in July. He has yet to 
win a PSAA contest this year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Andino, other Orange County surfers expected to compete include Matt 
Archbold (San Clemente), Shane Beschen (San Clemente), Vince De La Pena (Laguna 
Niguel), Pat O'Connell (Laguna Niguel) and Colby Outlaw (Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Defending Body Glove champion Christian Fletcher of San Clemente advanced to 
today's second round with a victory Tuesday. Also advancing were Craig 
Etchegoyen of Newport Beach and Nathan Fletcher of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, Fla., one of the top young surfers on the Assn. of 
Surfing Professionals world tour, also will be competing. He's scheduled to 
surf in today's third round. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stewart leads the bodyboarding standings by 668 points over fellow 
Hawaiian Ben Severson. 
</P>
<P>
The competition will begin each day at 7:30 a.m. The finals for the surfing and 
bodyboarding divisions are scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Sunday. MIKE REILLEY

FACING A FAMILY'S TRAUMA PUTS SPORT IN PERSPECTIVE

There is little swaggering among the football players at Cypress High School. 
Unlike many football teams, excess bravado seems nearly nonexistent. Egos 
remain fixed to reality. The macho-quotient runs low. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might point out the reason for this is that Cypress -- a team that is 
12-24 in the past four years under Coach John Selbe and has not had a season 
above .500 since it went 6-4 in 1981 -- has had little reason to put on airs. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not necessarily the case. Cypress finished 5-5 last year, fourth in 
the Empire League. Not a championship team, but not a pooch, either. 
</P>
<P>
But one situation has taught the team more about maturity than any late-game, 
third-and-one situation ever could. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, standout sophomore tackle Joe Toohey learned that his 
15-year-old girlfriend was pregnant with his child. Shortly after its birth, 
the baby, Alyssa, was diagnosed as having histiocytosis x, a rare disease that 
affects the immune system. In infants, the disease is similar to advanced 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
In December, after spending much of her first year in the hospital, Alyssa 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Toohey's father was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder. He 
has been hospitalized the past seven months, and has since lost his bladder to 
the disease and his right leg to complications. He will undergo more surgery 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Toohey, 18, is one of three varsity assistants at Cypress. Along with 
two other standouts from last year's team, Ramon Reid and Jayson Bern, Toohey 
helps coach the offensive and defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
Reid and Bern, also all-league selections last year, have faced disappointment 
in their athletic careers. Last fall, Reid sustained a career-ending knee 
injury and Bern suffered a broken neck vertebra that left him temporarily 
paralyzed. But each admits Toohey's problems have put theirs in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
During the season opener last September, Cypress defeated Kennedy, 7-6, with 
Toohey keying the defense on a late-game goal-line stand. 
</P>
<P>
The following Monday, Toohey was awarded the game ball. Another ball was 
presented for his daughter, who had become the team's inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
After the presentation, the players hugged Toohey. "They just wanted him to 
know they were there for him," Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
Selbe, who made frequent visits to the hospital to see Alyssa, has on his desk 
a framed photograph of himself with Toohey, his girlfriend and the baby. Alyssa 
died a month after the photo was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress players and coaches attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"You would like to believe," Selbe said, "that all this stuff that we tell the 
kids about handling adversity has helped Joey in some way. . . . This is one of 
those situations where you really hope it has." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Toohey, Joe's mother, says her son's involvement with coaching has 
given him a sense of stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Our home life is so torn up right now, at least he's got Coach Selbe and his 
friends on the team," Patricia Toohey said. "He's had his share of bad days, 
but thank God he has that team for support." 
</P>
<P>
There's no question it has had an effect on the Cypress players and on the team 
as a whole. "It made us think," said senior lineman Youssef Semaan. "And it 
bonded us together even more than we already were." 
</P>
<P>
Selbe says Toohey's tragedy gave them a sense of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a family," Selbe said. "We've been with him through all his tough times. 
. . . What happened to Joey made them realize there's more to the football 
experience -- there's more to life -- than playing games and scoring 
touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
A moving thought for the football-frenzied weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
Add Cypress: For Selbe, the only on-campus coach on his staff, hiring three of 
last year's players as assistants was an unusual but necessary means of 
replacing three assistants who took jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed coaches, and when I asked them, the kids were interested," 
Selbe said. "Right now, I'm coaching coaches, and I'm coaching kids." 
</P>
<P>
Certain adjustments had to be made by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Players cannot call Toohey, Reid or Bern by their first names, even though many 
consider the three their closest friends. And off-field socialization is to be 
kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Said Semaan, one of Reid's best buddies: "We'll go to the movies, Coach Reid 
and me, but he still wants me to call him Coach Reid. 
</P>
<P>
"During Hell Week, when it got real tough, I wanted to say 'Leave me alone! Get 
out of my face!' But Ramon -- I mean Coach Reid -- he'd push me even harder. 
That's when I knew I wasn't getting a break this year." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: Which Orange County schools return more than one all-Southern 
Section football player? 
</P>
<P>
Included in the Southern Section cross-country preview, a 15-page informative 
packet sent to all coaches, is a section titled: 
</P>
<P>
"23-Point Defensive Game Plan for Lawsuit-Conscious Coaches." 
</P>
<P>
What, no videotape edition? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Newport Harbor (kicker Josh Klein and wide receiver George 
Greenwalt) and Santa Margarita (linebacker Mike Farris and defensive back Josh 
Ireland).

ACQUISITION BY TOKOS CONCLUDED; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH STRATEGY: THE NEW SUBSIDIARY IS EXPECTED TO WIN FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A 
UTERINE-MONITORING DEVICE FOR DETECTION OF PRE-TERM LABOR. 
</P>

Tokos Medical Corp. Tuesday concluded a $31.4-million acquisition of a small 
Atlanta-based firm that it hopes will be the first to win federal approval to 
market a uterine-monitoring device to detect pre-term labor. 
</P>
<P>
The completion of the merger with Physiologic Diagnostic Service, first 
announced in June, was delayed pending completion of a Federal Trade Commission 
review of the deal's antitrust implications. Tokos said the FTC completed its 
investigation Friday without taking any action. 
</P>
<P>
Tokos officials said the combination gives Tokos a solid foundation for growth 
because the company now will be able to aggressively market a device for use by 
women with a history of pre-term labor. In addition, the company hopes to win 
other Food and Drug Administration approvals for use of the monitoring device. 
</P>
<P>
"It will . . . enable us to expand the approved FDA indications for our home 
uterine activity monitors and enhance our ability to obtain broader 
reimbursement coverage of our pre-term labor management services," Tokos 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert F. Byrnes said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted favorably to the news of the merger. Tokos' stock closed at 
$11.625, up $1.625 in heavy over-the-counter trading Tuesday. Still it is 
trading below its March initial offering price of $12 and its 1990 high of 
$16.50. 
</P>
<P>
"The rebound in the stock price is pretty much replacing the decline (in Tokos' 
stock price) that occurred when the FTC began its investigation," said Dorothy 
Ryan, senior health services analyst with Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., a San 
Francisco-based securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Tokos acquired all of PDS's 2.7 million outstanding shares. PDS, which provides 
home uterine activity monitoring for pregnant women at high risk of premature 
birth, becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokos. 
</P>
<P>
While PDS is an unprofitable company, Ryan said its acquisition by Tokos is a 
strategic coup because the deal is expected to provide Tokos access to the 
first product with federal authorization to be marketed for detecting the onset 
of pre-term labor. 
</P>
<P>
In April, PDS received a recommendation of marketing approval from the FDA's 
medical advisory panel, meaning that the clinical tests of its monitor have 
satisfied the FDA's criteria for safety and effectiveness. The panel 
recommendation makes final FDA approval of the device likely. 
</P>
<P>
For many years some physicians have prescribed similar devices for women with 
high-risk pregnancies to help them know when to use drugs and other methods to 
prevent premature deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
However, the previous inability of Tokos and other companies to obtain FDA 
approval of their devices had raised skepticism in the medical community about 
the effectiveness of the technology, and in some cases insurance companies had 
refused to pay for the service.

Rockwell Reshuffling: Rockwell International's Defense Electronics unit in 
Anaheim has reorganized its communications, avionics and command-and-control 
businesses to gain market and technical efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Tony Longo said the company will combine the headquarters of 
its command-and-control business in San Bernardino with another unit in 
Richardson, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The combined headquarters will move to Richardson. The relocation will have a 
minimal effect on employees, Longo said. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is combining its Collins Government Avionics Division and the 
communications and intelligence business segment of Collins Defense 
Communications in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The moves complete a reorganization that began in March when the company formed 
its Defense Electronics unit by combining its Autonetics unit in Anaheim with 
its Collins defense units, said John A. McLuckey, Rockwell Defense Electronics 
president.

BANK PAYS $101,000 FOR WESTERN EMPIRE'S DEPOSITS; 
</P>
<P>
BAILOUT: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BANK ACQUIRES NEARLY $135 MILLION IN FAILED 
S&amp;L'S INSURED ACCOUNTS. THE THRIFT'S TWO BRANCHES OPENED TUESDAY AS OFFICES 
OF THE BANK.

<P>
Southern California Bank paid $101,000 Tuesday for nearly $135 million in 
insured deposits at the failed Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan, which was 
seized by regulators in February. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's two branches opened Tuesday as offices of the Downey-based SCB 
after the transaction was approved late Friday by federal regulators running 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
SCB will keep Western Empire's Yorba Linda branch -- the thrift's original 
headquarters and the heart of its operation -- but will close the Irvine branch 
within a month, said Norman Morales, the bank's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate cost to taxpayers for the S&amp;L's collapse was estimated at $24 
million by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that operates and 
liquidates failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
All deposits continue to be insured to the federally guaranteed limit, but the 
bank can lower interest rates on deposits after two weeks. The bank has the 
option to return portions of about $135 million in assets and to purchase other 
assets within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire got into trouble in the mid-1980s with large commercial loans 
and other real estate properties. It was insolvent but not seized in late 1988 
when regulators approved its sale to Castle Harlan Inc., a New York merchant 
banking and investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Harlan put $15.8 million in cash into the purchase and received approval 
from regulators to revive the thrift through the purchase of junk bonds, 
high-yield, high-risk debt securities. But the federal law that restructured 
the thrift industry in August, 1989, banned such investments by S&amp;Ls, and 
the junk bond market began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire had $191.8 million, or 33.8% of its $567.8 million in assets, in 
junk bonds, and the writedowns it had to take wiped out its capital. 
</P>
<P>
SCB, which has $415 million in assets and 16 branches, was one of only two 
bidders for Western Empire. Regulators would not release the name of the other 
bidder. The RTC accepted the SCB's bid because it deemed it to be the least 
costly proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Morales said more than $100 million in Western Empire's deposits are in 
high-cost certificates of deposit -- so-called brokered deposits -- that the 
thrift had brought in from money brokers to finance its business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Those high rates will be reduced after two weeks, Morales said, and customers 
will have right to take their money out without penalty for early withdrawal. 
He said the bank expects all the brokered deposits to be withdrawn, leaving the 
bank with about $33 million in deposits from customers who live in the Yorba 
Linda area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited about the transaction," Morales said. "The Yorba Linda 
community is a natural fit with our offices in Placentia and Anaheim Hills and 
the type of business we seek. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Empire has a very tight community-oriented branch," he said. "It has a 
very good name here." 
</P>
<P>
The bank will keep the seven employees at the Yorba Linda branch, he said, and 
nearly 30 employees at the Irvine headquarters branch will work for the RTC 
only as long as it takes to wind down operations that aren't being sold to the 
bank.

ON-SITE TOXIC CONTROL APPEARS POISED TO CLEAN UP WITH NEW SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ORDERS ARE STARTING TO FLOW FOR THE SANTA ANA FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY 
FOR DECONTAMINATING WATER WITH ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As many environmental entrepreneurs have discovered, developing a technology to 
clean up waste is easier than convincing people to use it. Government and 
private officials don't like surprises and are often reluctant to try new, 
unproven techniques. 
</P>
<P>
But persistence can eventually pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Consider On-Site Toxic Control Inc. The Santa Ana-based company has developed a 
system to clean chemically contaminated water using ultraviolet light, and 
after six years in business, the orders are finally starting to flow. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Fletcher, president of the 22-person firm, said that 16 of the systems 
have been sold so far, and five more sales are expected to close this month. If 
all goes according to plan, company revenues this year will double from the 
$1.6 million reported for the fiscal year ended June 30, Fletcher said, and 
making a profit is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The company's technology, marketed through it's Ultrox International 
subsidiary, uses a combination of high-intensity ultraviolet light, ozone and 
hydrogen peroxide to break down poisonous organic compounds that are dissolved 
in water. The chemicals, including many that are found in gasoline, pesticides 
and solvents, are reduced to a harmless combination of carbon dioxide, water 
and salt. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Ultrox's sales thus far have been to companies that use the system to 
clean dirty water from industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
But the system can also be used for ground water, and the California Department 
of Health Services recently chose the Ultrox technology to clean water from a 
contaminated well in South Gate. The $500,000 unit in South Gate will purify 
1.5 million gallons of water a day in its 18-foot-long, 6-foot-high tank. 
Several established technologies for removing organic compounds from water 
already exist, but they rely on charcoal filters, which themselves become 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Carbon gets the stuff out of the water, but then you have to do something with 
the carbon," said Fletcher. "Our process gets rid of the problem, as opposed to 
concentrating it or transferring it." 
</P>
<P>
That can be especially important for certain kinds of applications, such as 
cleaning the cooling water in a nuclear reactor. Any waste generated from 
cleaning reactor water is radioactive, and thus very expensive to dispose of. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Head, principal engineer in the nuclear power division of General 
Electric Co., said his company had been evaluating the Ultrox technology for 
five years, and was now prepared to market it to nuclear utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"For this use, it's the only kind of technology worth considering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultrox also has an agreement with the Unipure Group of the Unocal Chemical Co. 
to sell a combined water treatment system to oil refineries. Unipure has a 
technology for removing heavy metals from the waste water, Fletcher explained, 
after the metals are eliminated the water flows to the Ultrox system to have 
the organic chemicals removed. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, how many systems Ultrox sells will depend on how much dirty 
water actually gets cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge market," Fletcher said, "as long as people actually do it."

'SPIRITUAL' HELP IS JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
MENTAL HEALTH: 'CRISIS' HOT LINES OFFER COUNSELING AND REFER CALLERS TO 
THERAPISTS, GURUS AND PRIESTS. MAINSTREAM PRACTITIONERS ARE SKEPTICAL.

After unsuccessful attempts to contact the President, a man with premonitions 
of a "Kadafi attack" on America wants to speak to someone who will believe him. 
</P>
<P>
A worried mother has just heard the latest psychic prediction of when the big 
earthquake will hit. Is there time to get her family out of California? 
</P>
<P>
A 60-year-old woman, convinced that a male witch is trying to ruin her life, 
needs the phone number of an exorcist. 
</P>
<P>
Whether mystical, magical, occult or just extraordinary, the dilemma has 
probably been heard at one of California's "spiritual crisis" hot lines: the 
Spiritual Emergence Network (SEN) in Menlo Park and Heartline in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The services, which together handle more than 150 calls each week, might prompt 
some to sigh and suggest anew that there are no limits to the idiosyncrasies of 
California living and thinking. There is certainly skepticism about them in the 
mental health community. 
</P>
<P>
But the hot lines, proponents argue, raise deeper, important issues about 
modern society, religious beliefs and mental health. Reduced to its simplest, 
the function of these hot lines raises the question: Should everyone who acts 
or speaks in an illogical manner, who undergoes a seemingly inexplicable 
experience, be considered mentally ill? Or should paranormal behavior and 
experiences be treated as spiritual or religious revelations? 
</P>
<P>
This is no idle query at a time when, in the search for mental, physical and 
spiritual well-being, many Americans have turned to non-Western religious and 
metaphysical practices, such as Sufism and Kundalini Yoga, as well as Christian 
mysticism. It's also a time when "New Age" ideas -- such as the healing 
properties of crystals, astral projection and channeling -- have grown in 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Those who run the hot lines assert that many mainstream mental health experts 
are too quick to label unusual behavior as psychotic. Instead, they contend, 
such conduct might simply indicate that an individual is undergoing a 
little-understood "spiritual awakening" that may lead to natural mental and 
physical healing. 
</P>
<P>
For many callers, contact with the Spiritual Emergence Network offers "the 
first time they've been listened to and haven't been called crazy," said SEN 
director Jeneane Prevatt. 
</P>
<P>
SEN, she explained, is an information and referral network with 22 regional 
offices in the United States and 21 in other countries. In Menlo Park, one 
full-time and one part-time employee answer phones with help from volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Callers fall into two categories, staffers say. Some seek guidance in their 
spiritual quests. Others relate experiences involving strange, inexplicable 
phenomena. Some callers complain of being possessed by everything from demons 
to displaced spirits to meddling acquaintances, said Daisy Spiegel, SEN's Los 
Angeles regional coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
When answering such calls, Spiegel said she first tries to determine whether 
the callers "want to look within themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Callers who want an exorcism are referred to the Healing Light Center, a 
metaphysical church in Glendale where trained healers believe they can cure 
spiritual and physical ailments by placing their hands on people. 
</P>
<P>
But if the caller seeks more immediate advice, Spiegel, a licensed clinical 
social worker and family counselor, said she will talk with "the voices" to 
help the person who hears them discover what may be causing them to be 
"possessed." 
</P>
<P>
Callers are referred to traditional religious and medical sources as well as 
alternative practitioners, Prevatt said. 
</P>
<P>
The network first directs callers to its regional coordinators. If none exists 
in their area, they are directed to specialists, such as a therapist, guru, 
Indian medicine man, nun or priest. 
</P>
<P>
SEN requires its regional coordinators to be licensed therapists who know 
psychiatrists to whom they can refer callers. But Prevatt concedes that the 
network's $80,000 annual budget prohibits the screening of specialists. She 
said callers are informed of this and advised to use their best judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SEN, Heartline, which gets half a dozen calls weekly, counsels some of 
its callers over the phone, said its director, Mark Waldman. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when someone uses the hot lines? The answer varies. 
</P>
<P>
A 28-year-old woman counseled by Heartline praised the service, saying it 
helped her come to terms with her strong affinity for God. But the woman's 
mother assailed Heartline, blaming it for her daughter's refusal to get 
psychiatric help. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said that her daughter told her last November that she was a Christ 
and that Jesus and other spirits spoke through her. The mother flew to Los 
Angeles from New York City to try to bring her daughter back East. 
</P>
<P>
But because of her mental state, the daughter had to be put in a hospital, 
where a psychiatrist tentatively diagnosed her as suffering from 
manic-depressive psychosis, the mother said, adding, "We don't really know 
what's wrong with her . . . she never avails herself of (long-term) psychiatric 
monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
While hospitalized, the daughter said a friend suggested that she try 
Heartline. She called Waldman and he helped her understand, she said, that she 
was "a person with a strong spiritual affinity for God." He helped boost her 
self-esteem and her ability to tell her doctor about what she was experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
The woman has been released from the hospital and now lives in a Los Angeles 
apartment where she spends time alone talking to "spirit guides" who, she said, 
are healing her. 
</P>
<P>
Waldman said he told the woman not to try to heal herself and recommended 
religious and spiritual workshops. "The best we can do is be there during an 
emotional crisis, give good referrals and hope that is enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman's mother is furious with Heartline because, she said, its 
counselors are "predisposed" to think her daughter is "a channeler. All they do 
is validate the illness without considering it as an illness. That's denial." 
</P>
<P>
The hot lines can be traced to the work of psychologists and medical 
researchers who, in the 1960s, began investigating out-of-the-ordinary mental 
states and how spiritual crises affect physical and mental health. Among them 
are Dr. Stanislav Grof, a psychiatrist who has spent 30 years researching 
"nonordinary states of consciousness," and Claudio Naranjo, a Chilean-born 
psychiatrist and author, said Russ Brown, SEN research coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Although their theories differed, the researchers generally agreed that 
treating people's minds and bodies but not their "spiritual well-being" could 
keep patients from getting and being healthy, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
SEN and Heartline hope to address this issue. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to influence the mental health Establishment and to establish the 
scientific validity of what it calls the spiritual awakening processes, SEN 
keeps records of its calls. These will be made available to scholars and 
researchers, although callers' identities will be kept secret, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he said, SEN organizers hope that a definition of "psycho-spiritual 
crisis" will be recognized by the mainstream psychiatric community. They hope 
it will be added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
the standard reference used by psychiatrists in diagnosing mental states. 
</P>
<P>
But many traditional mental health experts express skepticism about theories 
espoused by SEN and Heartline. 
</P>
<P>
American Psychiatric Assn. officials would not discuss SEN or Heartline but 
provided a statement repeating its position that therapists should separate 
their own beliefs from those of their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dennis J. Munjack, director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at County-USC 
Medical Center, acknowledged that experts may find it difficult to 
differentiate between psychosis and cultural and religious experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he believes that if care is taken, there is little likelihood of 
misdiagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
For those who do not want to go the route of traditional medicine, however, SEN 
and Heartline offer a service, said Waldman, Heartline's director. 
</P>
<P>
The popular suggestion that many of these ancient, complicated belief systems 
and religions can be mastered or even understood quickly promotes problems, he 
said, adding, "People are opening doors of the unconscious mind that are 
usually shut very tight and they don't know what to do next." 
</P>
<P>
This problem is compounded in Los Angeles, where seekers may turn to greedy 
spiritual guides and gurus who themselves are often lost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary Jo Meadows, a certified clinical psychologist and director of 
religious studies at Mankato State University in Minnesota, expressed doubts 
about the growing number of people who claim to have undergone spiritual 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
True spiritual growth, she said, comes from study and long, hard practice -- 
the sort of seeking, self-discipline and piety, for example, that she sees in 
serious students of Buddhism and Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she said, "spirituality nowadays means having exciting, altered 
experiences. The lifestyles of most of the people claiming to have these 
experiences are self-indulgent and not compatible with spiritual lifestyles. 
Genuine spiritual work must be built on a solid moral base."

</P>
<P>
HONORS: PAMELA POLAGI, WHO IS BLIND, HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR A CIVIC AWARD IN 
RECOGNITION OF HER DETERMINATION IN OVERCOMING OBSTACLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pamela Polagi does not give up easily. 
</P>
<P>
When Seffi, her German shepherd and companion for the past nine years, 
developed back problems, Polagi overruled the vets. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors wanted to put her to sleep, but I said no," she said. "Just 
because she could not be of service as a working dog, I still didn't want to 
give her up as a companion. She still had the will to live, and still followed 
me around." 
</P>
<P>
Polagi, who is blind, has brought the same attitude to her work as an insurance 
claims representative at the Automobile Club of Southern California office in 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she was reeling from the recent deaths of her parents, Polagi in 
1980 mastered a complicated computer system for the blind while the rest of her 
colleagues were still using typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
Then, four years ago, the insurance claims department shifted all its records 
to computers, and Polagi had to learn to use equipment compatible with other 
employees'. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a co-worker nominated Polagi for the eighth annual "Mainstream 
Milestones" awards sponsored by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce. The 
event was established to honor disabled adults in a business or professional 
occupation, said Catherine Lepone, co-project leader for the awards. Winners 
will be announced in November. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Brake, assistant manager of the Automobile Club's Los Angeles district 
office, said she nominated Polagi because of her determination. 
</P>
<P>
"She succeeded in her challenges, and I admire people that do that," Brake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Polagi, a 37-year-old Temple City resident, has worked for the Automobile Club 
for 17 years. In 1973, she took a two-week job-training program at the Braille 
Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I wanted to work with people. Back then, blind people usually were 
placed in a job taking dictation. I didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
The institute paid her a token $100 a month for her work as a receptionist in 
the sales department of the Automobile Club's Pasadena office. After seven 
years, Polagi said, she was ready for more responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
She uses an IBM personal computer that scans accident and injury forms. A voice 
synthesizer attached to the computer tells Polagi which questions to ask 
customers. She types the information into the computer, and can print it out on 
a specially constructed Braille printer. 
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, Polagi and her twin sister, who is also blind, sing at 
weddings for friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I get by," she said. "I don't think I'm great. I've never gotten over stage 
fright. I still have to convince my knees to stop shaking."

TELEVANGELIST MAKES MOVIE; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: PAUL F. CROUCH'S TUSTIN-BASED TRINITY BROADCASTING NETWORK IS PRODUCING A 
$6-MILLION FEATURE BASED ON THE LIFE OF CHINESE-AMERICAN EVANGELIST NORA LAM.

<P>
Proclaiming that he is "not willing to surrender the motion picture media to 
the devil," Orange County televangelist Paul F. Crouch is breaking into the 
movie business with a $6-million feature film, aimed at mainstream theater 
audiences and financed entirely by donations. 
</P>
<P>
The film, "China Cry," is based on the life of Chinese-American evangelist Nora 
Lam and carries the subtitle, "A True Story." Although a new ending was shot 
last week at Newhall Ranch, a rough cut is being screened for ministers and 
motion picture industry executives. The final version is scheduled to open Nov. 
2 in 25 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Packed with recognizable Asian-American and Eurasian actors and shot mostly in 
Hong Kong and Macao, the film tells the story of Lam's life in China before and 
after the 1949 Communist revolution. A critical episode, both in the book and 
film, comes when Lam refuses to denounce Christ and is led before a nighttime 
firing squad. As the courtyard is suddenly bathed in an otherworldly light, she 
feels the bullets passing near her but is miraculously spared. 
</P>
<P>
As befits the founder and president of the 200-station Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, Crouch is marketing the film in a big way -- complete with 
razzle-dazzle TV promotions, slick posters and brochures, a book tie-in and an 
innovative plan to "pre-sell" millions of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"China Cry" is presented by TBN Films -- a new, nonprofit California 
corporation -- with Crouch listed as executive producer and his son, Matt, as 
associate producer. The film was shot in color, features Dolby sound and is 
entirely a union production. 
</P>
<P>
It was written and directed by James F. Collier, a Directors Guild member and 
veteran of Billy Graham's Worldwide Pictures. Collier wrote or directed several 
other "inspirational" films aimed at mainstream audiences, including "Caught," 
"Cry From the Mountain," "Joni" and "The Hiding Place," the story of the late 
Corrie Ten Boom and her efforts to save Dutch Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The director of photography, David Worth, shot Clint Eastwood's "Bronco Billy." 
The music and orchestration is by the Oscar-winning team of Al Kasha and Joel 
Hirschhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1988, when Worldwide Pictures was closed by the Graham organization, 
has there been such a direct effort by a religious organization to produce a 
mainstream feature film with Christian content. (Sun Myung Moon's Unification 
Church produced the $45-million "Inchon" in 1982, but that box office bomb, 
dealing with Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Korean War landing, made no attempt to 
proselytize for Moon or his church.) 
</P>
<P>
Film critic Michael Medved, co-host of PBS's "Sneak Previews," attended a 
recent screening and called "China Cry" "a very professional piece of work." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that "the look of the picture is quite authentic," especially the 
Shanghai section, adding that the Christian aspects of the film are "relatively 
subtle. . . . There are very few moments where it is embarrassing or (where) 
the budget shows." 
</P>
<P>
Medved contrasted "China Cry" with some of the Billy Graham films, which while 
"fairly well done," were frankly "advertisements for God" that preached mainly 
to the converted or those ripe for conversion. Medved said he did find it 
curious that Crouch, aiming to control costs and reach a mainstream audience, 
chose for his first effort a period story set in another country and culture. 
</P>
<P>
In the rough cut at least, there are also some discreet sexual references (a 
love scene between the stars -- both clothed in pajama tops and bottoms -- 
after their wedding alludes to the fact that Lam was pregnant before her 
marriage). In addition, it includes some violence that borders on the 
gratuitous (a bloody martial arts sequence involving Lam's Red Army 
interrogator serves no discernible plot function). 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin-based Trinity network has more than a dozen TV stations outside the 
United States, concentrated in northern Italy, the Caribbean and Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of "China Cry" are so committed to reaching a worldwide audience that 
they took a 12-minute segment of the picture to this year's Cannes Film 
Festival. Accompanying the distributor -- Tim Penland of Penland Productions -- 
was the star, Julia Nickson-Soul (the wife of actor David Soul), who was 
featured with Sylvester Stallone in "Rambo II" and appeared in the TV 
miniseries "Noble House." 
</P>
<P>
The cast also includes co-star Russell Wong, who appeared in "Eat a Bowl of 
Tea" and "Tai-Pan"; France Nuyen ("The World of Suzie Wong" and "South 
Pacific"); James Shigeta ("Flower Drum Song" and "Midway"), and Philip Tan 
("Tango and Cash," "Batman" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"). 
</P>
<P>
In Trinity's August, 1990, newsletter, Crouch wrote, "I am not willing to 
surrender the motion picture media to the devil. . . . If Hollywood had 
produced ("China Cry"), you can be sure they would have cut any witness for 
Christ out of it. So we had to do it ourselves. And, partners, we have done it! 
Praise the Lord!" 
</P>
<P>
With "China Cry," Crouch said, "a whole new door is opening up to this army of 
the Lord: theater doors. And into this dark corner of our world we are going to 
shine the light of the Gospel! . . . The church let the evil one have the great 
motion picture media." 
</P>
<P>
The director's goals are considerably more modest. "I became involved (in 
'China Cry') because I thought there ought to be one show that's inspirational 
coming out of the industry each year," Collier said after one screening. 
</P>
<P>
This is not Crouch's first involvement with motion pictures. In 1961-65, he 
headed the department of TV and film production for the Assemblies of God in 
Burbank. In August, 1988, he used Trinity to help mobilize -- on extremely 
short notice -- a rally at Universal Studios in Burbank that drew 25,000 people 
to protest the release of "The Last Temptation of Christ." Crouch called on Lew 
Wasserman, Universal's chairman, to allow the outraged fundamentalists to buy 
the film and, in Crouch's words, "burn it at the stake." 
</P>
<P>
Penland, the distributor, resigned his position as Universal's liaison with the 
evangelical community to help organize opposition to "The Last Temptation of 
Christ." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview last week, Crouch acknowledged that it was the 
controversy over "The Last Temptation" that propelled him into film production. 
"That's one of things that impelled me to get involved, instead of cursing the 
darkness," Crouch said. "I saw a real need in the area of the motion-picture 
field. . . . We are not only hoping to reach the present film-going public, but 
we're also hoping to appeal to that large segment of the population that has 
stopped going to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
The producing experience provided him with an education. As "a complete 
neophyte," Crouch said, the countless details and decisions of movie-making 
"took much more of my time than I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Crouch has been using his nonprofit, tax-exempt network 
to build support for "China Cry," talking about it regularly on his prime-time 
talk show, "Praise," and reporting on its progress, both in documentary reports 
from the set in Hong Kong by Crouch's son, Matt, and in the broadcast 
ministry's newsletter. (Neither Crouch took fees for his work on the picture.) 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, clips from the film have appeared frequently during Trinity's 
24-hour-a-day Christian programming, seen locally on the network's flagship, 
KTBN-Channel 40. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Trinity's involvement in the film 
business has been in financial backing and distribution plans for "China Cry." 
Crouch simply asked viewers to give money to make the film, rather than invest. 
Any money brought in by "China Cry," Crouch said, would be put into a revolving 
fund to make more movies. (One idea, Crouch said, would be a film version of 
the biblical Battle of Armageddon, complete with special effects and climaxing 
with the Second Coming.) 
</P>
<P>
One person who responded to Crouch's appeal -- to the tune of $40,000 -- was 
John F. Long, a Phoenix home developer. Through the charitable foundation that 
bears his name, Long donated the money to Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
Long said in a telephone interview that he had seen Lam on Trinity and had read 
her book. When Crouch made his appeal to support the movie, Long simply picked 
up the phone and did so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the type of movies that are being produced that young people are 
seeing, all the crime and violence, has an adverse affect," he said. "The 
reason I made the donation is that I believe I'm making an investment in the 
future of our young people. . . . It's important for the younger generation . . 
. to understand that miracles do happen in modern times." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has asked supporters, on the air and in the network's monthly 
newsletter, to fill in reservation coupons -- a "faith promise" -- committing 
them to buy blocks of tickets to the movie when it plays in their area. The 
aim, he wrote, is "to secure the partnership of a major distributor so that the 
film will be seen by the world, and not just by Christians." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, called "Advance Purchase Discount Tickets," in exchange for 
reserving blocks of 25 to 1,000 tickets, individuals receive a 20% discount. 
Groups, Crouch wrote, "may use this as an opportunity to gain a profit for 
their own ministries." (Despite this support for "China Cry," Crouch cautioned 
that support for the film "must come from your entertainment budget and not 
from your regular TBN gifts of support.") 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the 1981 Academy Award-winning "Chariots of Fire" and "The Mission" 
were sold in a similar fashion by various religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tim Penland, the distributor, more than 75,000 of these 
reservations have been received in the Orange County-Los Angeles area alone. 
More than 40 Southern California theaters have agreed to book the film in 
November, Penland said. As part of the marketing plan, the other 24 cities 
chosen for the film's platform opening -- including Denver, Miami and Dallas -- 
were selected to coincide with the location of Trinity's owned-and-operated TV 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket reservations so far total more than $5 million, Penland said. More than 
1 million requests have been received alone from the cities where "China Cry" 
is opening, Penland said, and he expects more than 2 million by the opening. In 
exchange for a payment of 80% of the local admission price, which varies from 
city to city, Penland will soon be sending out the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Keyed to the film's release, the religious publishing house Thomas Nelson will 
be issuing a "movie edition" of Lam's autobiography. "China Cry" has already 
sold more than 100,000 copies in a previous edition. The new edition, featuring 
a still from the movie on the cover and a new co-author, will be sold through 
both the Trinity and Lam ministries, as well as in bookstores, and may have a 
first printing of 200,000 copies, a Nelson spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to separate Crouch and Trinity Broadcasting Network from Nora 
Lam, her own ministry and "China Cry." Since 1982, the San Jose-based Lam has 
been listed as one of Trinity's "Foreign Missions" in the network's literature, 
and Lam appears regularly on Crouch's prime-time talk show, "Praise," and makes 
heartfelt appeals in Trinity's twice-yearly "Praise-athon" fund-raisers. 
Trinity produces Lam's Chinese-language religious programming, which is 
broadcast in Taiwan. Lam has been boosting both the film and the book in her 
own quarterly newsletter, China Today. 
</P>
<P>
Lam and Trinity have produced a non-religious TV magazine show seen on Chinese 
state TV, and Crouch has said several times that the Chinese government has 
agreed to broadcast "China Cry" as a four-part miniseries. However, that seems 
problematic in light of a recently reported ideological crackdown on the 
Chinese film industry. At a San Joaquin Valley revival several years ago, 
Crouch predicted that "the Bamboo Curtain is coming down!" 
</P>
<P>
In the world of Christian broadcasting, Lam is not without her critics -- none 
of whom will speak on the record. They have criticized her early relationship 
with the evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman, her fund-raising techniques, her tours to 
China. Some have accused her of embellishing 
</P>
<P>
details of her life story in "China Cry." Several years ago, Lam's organization 
was refused membership in the National Assn. of Evangelicals. Officials of the 
50,000-member organization based in Wheaton, Ill., would not reveal the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has had his own share of scrapes with controversy. He and his wife, Jan, 
began their broadcast ministry 17 years ago in partnership with Jim and Tammy 
Bakker, an arrangement that ended acrimoniously with the Crouches in control of 
the Orange County-based network and the Bakkers heading to North Carolina. In a 
recent book by Austin Miles, "Don't Call Me Brother," Bakker is quoted as 
claiming that the station "was literally stolen out from under us. . . . Nobody 
will ever take a television ministry away from us again." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Crouch and Trinity left the National Religious Broadcasters following 
a yearlong investigation by the voluntary organization's ethics committee, 
which looked into complaints by former employees, partners, colleagues and 
suppliers. Crouch and Trinity have been involved in civil suits and charges 
before various governmental boards in at least half a dozen states. Crouch 
reported an annual salary of $125,000 in 1988 and drives a $70,000 BMW supplied 
by the network. Crouch's wife, son and various in-laws are on Trinity's 
payroll, and another son recently received a large loan from the network to buy 
several TV stations.

HOSANNAS HEARD FOR RICHARD THOMPSON

If Richard Thompson keeps doing shows like this, he could be in danger of 
losing his standing as a "cult hero." 
</P>
<P>
Though hailed by Rolling Stone as the creator of two of the best albums of the 
last 20 years, and heavy with the hosannas of his musical peers, the British 
singer-writer-guitarist is far from household-name status. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at Seattle's Bumbershoot Festival Friday, Thompson played to a packed 
field of hard-core fans that was augmented by several thousand Thompson 
novitiates. And by show's end you couldn't tell them apart, as, by way of a 
third encore call, they sang the chorus refrain of Thompson's "Tear Stained 
Letter" for minutes after he had left the stage. Earlier in the show, when he 
asked for a throat lozenge, he'd been inundated with a Beatle-like hail of the 
things. Can Shea Stadium gigs be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
It has been two years since Thompson's most recent, typically wonderful and 
practically unheard album, "Amnesia" was released, but he hardly has been 
taking it easy since. Along with several solo tours -- including one that 
brings him to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight -- he has: 
composed and performed the soundtrack to an upcoming Taylor Hackford film; 
assembled the soundtrack for a British TV documentary, "Hard Cash" (the album 
is available domestically on the Green Linnet label); recorded a second avant 
garde John French-Fred Frith-Henry Kaiser-Richard Thompson album (out soon on 
Windham Hill); guested on albums by Maria McKee, Crowded House and others, and 
written a musical he has since decided he doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
The Hackford film proved the most demanding. Interviewed last Friday before his 
Seattle gig, Thompson described the film as "a lovable, wacky, Australian 
romantic comedy," though the creation of it was evidently a bit less carefree. 
Indicative perhaps of the second-guessing that goes on in the high-stakes film 
world, "Sweet Persuasion" is the fifth title given the flick so far, and 
Thompson wouldn't be surprised if it changes a few more times before its 
release next March. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike director Hackford's recent music bios -- "La Bamba" and "Chuck Berry -- 
Hail! Hail! Rock and Roll!" -- this film called for an original, acoustic-based 
score, which the 41-year-old guitarist is singularly equipped to provide. Best 
known for his terrifyingly emotive and intense electric work, Thompson was also 
a founding member of Fairport Convention, the '60s band that pioneered the 
exploration of centuries-old British folk styles. On acoustic guitar -- also 
the chosen instrument for his solo gigs -- he has a command of styles ranging 
from transposed 16th-Century Scottish pipe tunes to modern jazz. For the film 
he also played mandolin, which he's none too feeble on either. 
</P>
<P>
Though he reports he's "fairly pleased" with the result, Thompson wasn't 
particularly enamored of the experience of doing a film. Whether recording for 
independent labels of the majors, he has always held control over the integrity 
of his musical visions. It was a new experience to be overruled at times on 
those musical choices. "It's very difficult, especially when you think you're 
right. It was overall a long and difficult experience, which I don't think I'd 
take on again until the next millennium, which gives me 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how the soundtrack will hold up as music. Very much with films, 
the music is determined by what's required of the picture, which is why 'It 
sounds like film music' can so often be a derogatory phrase. It's often so 
boring, unless it's (Ennio) Morricone, Sir William Walton or Prokofiev. This 
will be coming out on an album, so judge for yourself," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is due to go in the studio next month to record his next Capitol 
album, that project is still unsettled. He plans to team again with "Amnesia" 
producer Mitchell Froom and will probably draw again from the "usual unusual" 
crew of musicians who peopled that album. Beyond that, he said, it could go in 
any number of directions, one being a divergent "concept album" he is loath to 
go into much detail about. "David Byrne might read it and steal my ideas," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
If the final direction allows, he'd like to commit the new songs he's been 
performing live to disc. Those include: "I Misunderstood," another of his 
seemingly endless supply of heartbreakingly sad songs; "1952 Vincent Black 
Lightning," a tale of motorcycle romance; "Why Must I Plead," described by 
Thompson as "a kind of Celtic Aaron Neville thing," and "I Feel So Good," a 
song that sounds uncharacteristically jubilant until one realizes its narrator 
is a released convict contemplating new mayhems. 
</P>
<P>
Though he likes nothing better than to have a free month in which to write, he 
said songwriting is a non-stop process for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with anything: words, music, riffs, hooks, lines and sinkers -- 
ideas, concepts, television, telephone directories, it doesn't matter. I think 
if you're going to write, you have to keep your ears and eyes open. When you're 
hit with an idea you're always looking for other bits of that idea. You're 
walking down the street and suddenly light bulbs go off and you take out your 
little notebook. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a full-time job, but the tax man doesn't believe that. I think I should 
be allowed to write off everything in my life, because everything in my life is 
relevant to my work, but they won't have it." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that isn't particularly relevant to his work is contemporary pop 
music. He doesn't listen to much of it, both because he wants to avoid copying 
others and because: "I really like to be thrilled by music, so I try not to 
listen to too much of it. When I do hear it, then it becomes more special." 
</P>
<P>
His recent tastes run toward baritone sax-man Gerry Mulligan's older work, 
opera and Madagascarian music. Whether listening to music or playing it, he's 
looking for the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the moments where the composer, player or players somehow just take off. 
They loose themselves and the music just flies. Those are the great moments. 
Playing, I think you aim to get lost in the music. You aim for excellence, even 
if you never achieve it. But sometimes it gets that way despite you. Sometimes 
with an audience you're able to communicate something, almost without 
interfering with it. Something just flies from here to there, flies around the 
room, and it's wonderful," Thompson exclaimed, adding with a laugh, "Then it's 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
"But I think there are moments where a performer touches an audience or when 
there's a mutual raising of spirits or something. I think musicians have a 
responsibility to tell the truth, to propagate ideas, to challenge people, if 
you like, and to create beauty. Music is such an elusive thing, I think talking 
about it is incredibly difficult, as I've just proved."

MELVIN DURSLAG: TEACHING HOW DEALS ARE DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who administer college football are depressed. They aren't able to 
understand the money madness seizing the children who play the game. 
</P>
<P>
With eligibility left, the kids are going over the wall to join the pros. What 
has happened to the student-athlete? You ask one: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you interested in engineering?" 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed I am. I am dying to study the power plant of a Ferrari -- my Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that undergraduates in football don't have the healthy 
outlook of their university elders, who see the game as simple beauty, free 
from commercial pressure and general money-grubbing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, colleges today play no more than 12 games. They are playing bowl 
games before the season even starts -- things called the Kickoff Classic and 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A college distinguished for its football has set up a private television deal 
with NBC. Lesser arrangements by universities result in as many as 11 games 
being seen on TV on a single Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't the players comport themselves like those who run college football, 
detached from earthly goods, dedicated to the spirit of friendly rivalry that 
sportsmen seek? 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Day, you will see that the number of bowl games on television has 
been limited to eight. 
</P>
<P>
"You will note the restraint," university people will tell players thinking of 
jumping to the pros. "We easily could play 10 on New Year's, scheduling two 
games between midnight and 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, college football favored us with four bowls on Jan. 1 -- Rose, 
Orange, Cotton and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
It expanded to five with something known as the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. Then, 
presumably on a leveraged buyout, the Florida Citrus Bowl took over the 
Tangerine Bowl and soon bumped New Year's Day viewing to six games. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl increased it to seven, the figure now escalating to eight 
with a switching of dates of the Mazda Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Eight bowl games battling each other on the same day might appear as overkill, 
but what's a little cannibalization among educated people? 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Cotton Bowl has come to be called the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the 
Sugar Bowl the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl. The Sun Bowl became the John Hancock Sun 
Bowl, until such time as the sponsor decided such billing was a deterrent to 
direct communication. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to John Hancock Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And the universities, observing events, go along, because they are not as 
commercially oriented as today's players. 
</P>
<P>
Over in Tucson, they got a postseason game certified known as the Copper Bowl. 
Linking up with a firm that makes mouth freshener, the game became known as the 
Copper BreathLess Bowl, but that would change to Copper Bowl, presented by 
BreathLess. 
</P>
<P>
Last heard from, the game was still breathing, but without its mouth-freshening 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is watched unblinkingly by the colleges, role models for those 
student-athletes who would dump their schools for a lousy $80,000 a year from 
the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Since only one bowl game, the Rose, has fixed participants every year, the 
others must hoof it, entering into bloodlettings to beat out rivals for the 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rules prevent bowls from contacting teams before specified dates, and, of 
course, no school would fudge, accepting bids prematurely, because this would 
set a bum example for the players. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a school that lacks integrity, a player with eligibility might be 
tempted to talk to a pro team in the alley about the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Now, say, you play for Clemson where home sellouts are automatic. Why open with 
Miami when you can play Cal State Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Same financial result. 
</P>
<P>
So you wipe out Long Beach, 59-0, enhance the winning record and prepare three 
weeks down the line to entertain Appalachian State. Picturing George Allen, 
Long Beach coach, on the sideline last Saturday, you heard him mumble: "The 
future is 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But Clemson establishes standards any admiring kid will want to emulate as he 
strolls the boulevard of life.

CAL RIPKEN SR. SHOULD JOIN SONS ON FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once the Baltimore Orioles have eliminated themselves mathematically from what 
has become a ho-hum race in the Eastern Division of the American League, 
attention should be given the possibility of moving Cal Ripken Sr. to the 
active roster for the express purpose of letting him become the first father to 
join his two sons in a major-league lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was "on hold" a year ago because the Orioles were in contention 
until the second-to-last day of the season. But there's reason for giving it 
serious consideration this time around and not merely because the Seattle 
Mariners have Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. playing next to each other in 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
When the recommendation was made to Larry Lucchino, the club president, he 
smiled and said, "Why Doug Melvin, our farm director, mentioned the same thing 
in a meeting. We talked about what a fine marketing opportunity it afforded the 
Mariners to have both Griffeys as teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Melvin believes we could go the Mariners one better if we activated Cal Sr. 
and let him catch in a game. But Cal said if it happened he wanted to be 
assured of four at-bats, not just a token appearance." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken Sr. never made it to the majors but spent seven seasons in the Orioles' 
farm system before becoming a manager and giving the same organization 34 years 
of devoted service. We once saw Ripken at Wilson in the Carolina League, and 
behind the plate, he was close to mechanical perfection. He was, at the time, 
what Del Rice represented to the National League and Jim Hegan to the American 
-- just an exceptional receiver. 
</P>
<P>
An opportunity to catch in the majors was within the realm of his ability, but 
he suffered an arm injury and, unfortunately, the chance vanished. That's when 
he turned, out of necessity, to managing, coaching and scouting for the 
Orioles' minor-league department. 
</P>
<P>
Today he's a third-base coach and enjoys, through the pleasure of a parent, the 
performances of his sons, Cal Jr. and Billy. The boys realize Dad was denied a 
trial at the big-league level, through no fault of his. They'd like to see him, 
even at this late date, make a special appearance with the Orioles. Then he'd 
be both their father and teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Lucchino said that if it happened, he wouldn't want anyone to believe it was a 
"circus." Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles should feel indebted to Cal Sr. and to his family. It would be 
fitting if they encouraged it to evolve. It would be a classic moment to see 
Cal Sr. behind the bat with Cal Jr. at shortstop and Billy at second base. 
</P>
<P>
This would enable the Orioles to be literally "Ripken-strong up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the attention such a scenario would create. Much of Aberdeen, Md., and 
Harford County, where the Ripkens were born, would descend on Memorial Stadium 
to witness such an historic occasion.

A New York Yankee executive sued Fay Vincent in federal court Tuesday, accusing 
the commissioner of trying to run him and George Steinbrenner out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard L. Kleinman, executive vice president and chief operating executive of 
the Yankees, made the allegation in a $22-million suit against Vincent and John 
M. Dowd, the commissioner's special counsel who directed an investigation of 
Steinbrenner's dealings with gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman accused Vincent of framing him and Steinbrenner on charges they acted 
against the best interests of baseball and of covering up ex-Yankee outfielder 
Dave Winfield's involvement with Spira. 
</P>
<P>
The suit in Manhattan's federal court seeks to stop Vincent from holding a 
hearing Thursday to determine possible disciplinary action against Kleinman. 
U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand will hear arguments today on Kleinman's 
request for a temporary restraining order to block Vincent's hearing.

MORNING BRIEFING: HEAD OF STATE DIDN'T IMPRESS IN THIS STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
In his autobiography, "Bootlegger's Boy," former Oklahoma football coach Barry 
Switzer recounts what happened shortly before President Gerald Ford flipped the 
coin for the 1976 Texas-Oklahoma game in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer, Ford and Longhorn Coach Darrell Royal entered from the tunnel at the 
Oklahoma end of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Writes Switzer: "Darrell wasn't speaking to me and I had nothing to say to him, 
but both of us were trying to conduct a conversation with President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"As we became visible walking toward the field, there is some old redneck drunk 
Okie (obviously) who stands up several rows behind us and roars in this voice 
you can hear all the way out to the 50-yard line on both the east and west 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"'Who are those two . . . with Switzer?"' 
</P>
<P>
Add autobiography: Switzer continues: "I wanted to step in a hole from 
embarrassment. I didn't give a damn what Darrell thought, but in front of the 
President of the United States, this was . . . well, to tell the truth, it was 
funny. The whole crowd at the south half of the bowl was screaming with 
laughter. As the remark was passed from mouth to ear, the whole place started 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On opening day of the 1990 baseball season, which college 
conference had the most players on major league rosters? 
</P>
<P>
Double Spark: If Detroit's Cecil Fielder hits 50 home runs this season, he will 
have something in common with the last player to do it. 
</P>
<P>
When George Foster of Cincinnati became the 10th member of the 50-homer club in 
1977, his manager was Sparky Anderson, who now manages Fielder and the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
30-day drill: Ram quarterback Jim Everett, whose photograph appears on the 
current cover of Gentleman's Quarterly, could be working on a record even 
before the season opens. 
</P>
<P>
Said GQ Editor-in-Chief Art Cooper: "Our September issues are our biggest in 
terms of pages and circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said that the magazine's biggest seller was the September, 1985 issue, 
when the cover boy was Miami quarterback Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Roseanne trails by 25: Helen Hudson was presented with 26 long-stemmed roses by 
San Diego Padre Manager Greg Riddoch Monday night -- one for each major league 
ballpark, after Hudson completed the circuit by singing the national anthem in 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In April, her husband came up with the idea of singing the anthem in every 
park. Said Hudson, a New York singer-songwriter who knew nothing about baseball 
when her odyssey began: "It started out as a lark and turned into a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Add anthem circuit: Hudson battled the flu all day Monday but went to the mike 
fortified by a steady diet of cough drops. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't her closest call, though. After arriving at Shea Stadium in New York 
wearing culottes, she was told to find a dress to wear or management would play 
a tape of the anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hudson: "It was just before the game and I ran out to the turnstiles and 
started asking women who were about my size if I could borrow a dress. A gal 
ran into the bathroom, pulled off her dress, gave it to me, and I gave her my 
culottes." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Pacific 10, with 40.

AFC LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUT WILL IT BE SUPER?; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: BENGALS AND OILERS, WITH HIGH-TECH OFFENSES, HAVE BEST CHANCE TO 
OVERCOME SIX SUPER BOWL LOSSES IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In each of the past six years, the American Football Conference has resembled 
an express train moving smoothly through the countryside toward the end of the 
line, where it spectacularly derails. 
</P>
<P>
AFC teams have played the NFC on even terms each season since 1984, winning 
their share of the annual interconference series. Then each time, their 
champions have gotten untracked on the last afternoon, losing six consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can really explain it," Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said the 
other day, reviewing the AFC's record slump. "But I can't see it going on much 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's team, in fact, could reverse the momentum. The Bengals and Houston 
Oilers seem to be the best in their conference, and one or the other can be 
expected to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXV, Jan. 27 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Both are modern offensive teams. The Bengals play football the San Francisco 
49er way -- with a major new component, Wyche's no-huddle approach -- and the 
Oilers have converted to the run-and-shoot formation, which makes use of four 
wide receivers at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But they converted only a few weeks ago. The run and shoot is a radical 
departure from conventional football, and the Oilers may need a season of 
seasoning. The Bengals don't. 
</P>
<P>
Their time-proven offense took Wyche to the Super Bowl only 18 months ago, and 
that day, Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason led Joe Montana's team until 
the last minute, when Montana, ending a 20-16 rouser, did what he usually does. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Cincinnati's problem is the potency of its own division, the AFC's 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals are looking for big trouble from all three of their Central 
Division rivals -- the Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Oilers and Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
They also expect trouble from the evenly matched top four in the AFC West: the 
Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
These are the AFC's big eight -- of whom only five can make the 1990 playoffs 
along with an Eastern entry, the New York Jets or Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under a revised playoff system, three wild-card teams from each conference will 
compete with the six division winners, starting Jan. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches expect Denver to be one of the AFC's six. The Broncos are a more 
solid group than they seemed in Super Bowl XXIV, where Montana led the 49ers to 
a 55-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was the third of four jolts that Denver Coach Dan Reeves has taken in the 
past four years. His recent heart attack followed three Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncing back is what life is all about," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He's right about that, although this season, it will be either Cincinnati or 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1) CINCINNATI BENGALS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Boomer Esiason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Sam Wyche (51-47) 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals and 49ers are both led by Bill Walsh-trained coaches, Wyche and 
George Seifert, and their modern offenses are similar. A possibly decisive 
difference is that the 49ers spend heavily for talent. In contrast, one of 
Cincinnati's best two linemen, Max Montoya, went to the Raiders in the kind of 
Plan B exodus that San Francisco avoids by outbidding everyone else. Nor have 
the Bengals replaced injured back Ickey Woods. They can still win with Wyche's 
no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
2) HOUSTON OILERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Warren Moon 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jack Pardee (first year) 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents describe this team's talent as the best that ever lined up in 
the run-and-shoot formation, which Pardee previously brought to two other 
Houston winners: the United States Football League's Gamblers and the Southwest 
Conference's Cougars. The Oilers' unsurpassed blocking starts with Bruce 
Matthews, the receiving with Drew Hill and Ernest Givins. A defensive 
specialist, Pardee will address the problems on that side. The question is how 
fast they can adjust to a strange new offense. 
</P>
<P>
3) DENVER BRONCOS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: John Elway 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Reeves (91-55-1) 
</P>
<P>
Their Super Bowl wipeout last winter is still held against the Broncos by the 
same people who seem to forget that in Montana's three-game playoff parade, the 
49ers rolled over the Vikings and Rams the same way. Last year, when the 
Broncos' ancient weaknesses evaporated with a new defense and runner, Bobby 
Humphrey, they were 6-0 over the AFC in oxygen-thin Mile High Stadium. Nobody 
in the NFL comes close to matching Denver's home-field edge. 
</P>
<P>
4) PITTSBURGH STEELERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bubby Brister 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Chuck Noll (193-140-1) 
</P>
<P>
Having survived the winning '70s and slumping '80s, Noll hits the '90s with a 
good, young offense and improving defensive personnel. His Merrill Hoge-Tim 
Worley backfield became the NFL's best last year, and new coordinator Joe 
Walton will help the offense. The two questions: Is Brister an NFL comer? Can 
the defense hold the edge it got last year with coordinator Rod Rust, the new 
coach at New England? The defensive standout is cornerback Rod Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
5) SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Mark Vlasic, Billy Joe Tolliver 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Henning (6-10) 
</P>
<P>
With either youngster pitching for San Diego, the question is whether the 
Broncos, Chargers, Raiders or Chiefs will break out of the pack in a year when 
Denver has the only established quarterback. At most other positions, San Diego 
could be slightly ahead with runner Marion Butts, receiver Anthony Miller, 
linebacker Billy Ray Smith and the depth stored by former General Manager Steve 
Ortmayer and the incumbent, Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
6) RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jay Schroeder 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Shell (7-5) 
</P>
<P>
See paragraph above for a more exact placing of the Raiders, who, in various 
media surveys, have been ranked from first to last in their division -- and who 
have been mentioned by others for both the Super Bowl and the AFC cellar. They 
seem clearly stronger defensively and in the offensive line, and they have the 
fastest receivers in football. All they want from Schroeder is occasional 
accuracy on their favorite missile, the long, long pass to one of those 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
7) KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Steve DeBerg 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marty Schottenheimer 
</P>
<P>
(8-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
If for once DeBerg could play like Bernie Kosar or Jim Kelly, the Chiefs would 
jump to the head of the class in the AFC and even worry the NFC in the Super 
Bowl. They're sound enough elsewhere. They have a few receivers and a big 
running back, Christian Okoye, and at linebacker they line up an MVP-type in 
Derrick Thomas who would make any defense look good. When they have all their 
players, their secondary is among the finest. But it's really all up to DeBerg. 
</P>
<P>
8) CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bernie Kosar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bud Carson (10-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
Carson was 58 last year when they finally gave him an NFL team, and he won a 
division title. Then the Browns beat Buffalo in the playoffs before losing the 
AFC title game again in Denver. Although their quarterback ranks with the NFL's 
best, the Browns may otherwise be a touch short in talent. Still, some people 
say they'll win again with running backs Eric Metcalf and Kevin Mack, and with 
Clay Matthews and Michael Dean Perry on defense. 
</P>
<P>
9) BUFFALO BILLS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jim Kelly 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marv Levy (31-26) 
</P>
<P>
In a slumping division, this team hasn't taken charge as surely as its fans 
thought it would with its intellectual coach, belligerent quarterback, diligent 
general manager, Bill Polian, and its assortment of defensive stars -- Bruce 
Smith, Shane Conlan, Cornelius Bennett and others. They say in Buffalo that 
Kelly's talent has been diluted by abrasive relationships with teammates, but 
there's probably nothing wrong with the Bills that more consistency wouldn't 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
10) NEW YORK JETS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Ken O'Brien, Tony Eason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bruce Coslet (first year) 
</P>
<P>
A new general manager, Dick Steinberg, has brought in a new coach from the Bill 
Walsh school. And although the Jets in a rebuilding year might be over their 
heads in other divisions, they can make a run for it in the East if either 
passer is up to it. Some NFL club executives are predicting that in time, 
Steinberg and the AFC's other new general managers -- Beathard and Kansas 
City's Carl Peterson among them -- will end the NFC's Super Bowl dominance. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
After Denver, San Diego, the Raiders and Kansas City line up one through four, 
there is only one place left for the Seattle Seahawks. It is improbable, 
though, that they'll actually finish fifth. Their coach, Chuck Knox, has a way 
of hanging tough against any odds, and his defense will improve when he gets in 
his first draft pick, flashy lineman Cortez Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In Knox's offensive backfield, John L. Williams has the look of a run-and-shoot 
triple threat -- runner-receiver-blocker -- which is one reason the Seahawks 
may be in that formation more extensively than they now expect. 
</P>
<P>
Top to bottom, the AFC West has been called a strong division that would be one 
of the NFL's strongest if it had more quarterbacks of proven worth. The Elway 
contribution can be measured in one statistic: Of the AFC's 14 teams, the 
Broncos alone played in three 1980s Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Many scouts reason that the Chiefs and Chargers are set at most positions and, 
with Carl Peterson and Bobby Beathard rounding up talent, both soon may stand 
with the NFL's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
In this division last year, in one of the NFL's closest races of all time, 
Cleveland finished 9-6-1, Houston 9-7, Pittsburgh 9-7 and Cincinnati 8-8. It 
will come as no surprise to most in the AFC Central if the standings are the 
same this year -- or if they're just the reverse, with the Browns a half-game 
behind the others. 
</P>
<P>
Few NFL teams match the quality of the Cincinnati nucleus: blocker Anthony 
Munoz, receiver Eddie Brown, tight end Rodney Holman, runner James Brooks, 
passer Boomer Esiason, nose tackle Tim Krumrie and safety David Fulcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar will have a fourth offensive coordinator in 
four years, Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
The primary AFC Central question is how much Warren Moon will shake things up 
in Houston's run and shoot, and the mystery team is Pittsburgh, which, to many 
AFC critics, seems to be on the way up again. But Pittsburgh's Brister is the 
least experienced quarterback in a division with three giants, Moon, Esiason 
and Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Some of the NFL's most famous winners have come out of the franchises in this 
division -- the Jets with Joe Namath, the Dolphins with Bob Griese and Dan 
Marino, the Colts with John Unitas and Eric Dickerson, the Bills with O.J. 
Simpson, and, most recently, a New England Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
But to many in the AFC East, their division is in disarray -- although the 
Bills could still come back this year, and the Jets could come up. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Dan Marino keeps asking to be traded. Maybe he's saying something 
more. At 29, he's still the world's best passer. The question is whether Coach 
Don Shula, 60, has enough help besides receiver Mark Clayton and cornerback Tim 
McKyer. 
</P>
<P>
When the Colts drafted Jeff George last spring, they disclosed that they had 
the NFL's next great quarterback -- but he won't prove it this year. With Eric 
Dickerson out, Coach Ron Meyer has been left with not much but a linebacker, 
Duane Bickett, who can't run the ball or pass it. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are stocked with above-average players, none of them at 
quarterback. Though well-coached by rookie Rod Rust, 61, they are unlikely to 
overtake anyone except Indianapolis.

WALSH LEARNS IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO BE A BROADCASTER; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: BUT THE FORMER 49ER COACH IS WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE HIS TECHNIQUE 
AS AN NBC ANALYST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he was coaching, Bill Walsh was called a genius. Now, as he begins his 
second year as a broadcaster, the genius tag is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got potential," his supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't as kind. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Walsh thought it would be easy. He had worked hard and mastered coaching, 
so he would do the same thing with broadcasting, as his longtime friend, John 
Madden, did. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't worked out quite the same for Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
There have been times when he has asked himself, "What have I done? What have I 
gotten myself into?" 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Walsh has embarrassed himself as a football commentator. All 
things considered, he is doing all right. But John Madden, he's not. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 58, is proud of what he accomplished as a coach, as he should be. In his 
first year as leader of the San Francisco 49ers, they went 2-14. Two years 
later, they won the Super Bowl -- the first of three under Walsh during the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question is, can he show similar improvement in the broadcast booth? 
</P>
<P>
This is an important year for Walsh. His bosses at NBC expect improvement. They 
took a chance on him. Now they're looking for a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won't cover a Super Bowl until January of 1993. They want Walsh to be more 
polished by then. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview, Walsh seemed determined to make it. 
</P>
<P>
And if he doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
Then it's on to career No. 3, whatever it might be, or back to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think going back to the 49ers is a possibility, and I'm really too 
entrenched in the Bay Area to leave (to take a coaching job)," he said. "Maybe 
a small-college job in the area someplace, but that's really remote. I really 
don't think there is such a school. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, I'd tell myself to relax and low-key it, but I know I'd end up 
wanting to win just as bad as I did with the 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh acknowledged that he misses coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like someone who gets out of prison after 30 years and doesn't know what 
to do and has trouble adjusting to the outside world," he said. "You're a 
little lost. 
</P>
<P>
"After more than 30 years in coaching, you become accustomed to certain 
routines. At the time, you may not like a lot of things. But after you leave, 
it's hard to adjust, particularly if you've reached a certain stature, which I 
think I did." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, his mind is mostly on broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which areas he needs to work on, Walsh shook his head and said, 
"Everything." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has done its part, providing him with plenty of rehearsal time before he 
worked a game last season, and even hiring a voice teacher to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with my voice is it starts to get higher and higher as I talk," 
Walsh said. "Someone will tell me not to worry about it, to concentrate on the 
content, then someone else will tell me my voice needs work." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has been hearing more criticism from his NBC bosses this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was the coach of the Super Bowl champions, and treated with a 
certain reverence," he said. "Now I'm just another broadcaster and easier to 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh became a successful coach through hard work. Can he do the same in 
broadcasting? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "Sure, I work hard, but it takes more than that. It 
takes a certain knack. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I may have worked too hard. I'd end up with notes everywhere, too 
many notes. Now I'm learning to edit out what isn't important." 
</P>
<P>
He said putting names with numbers has been tough. 
</P>
<P>
"In coaching, I never worried about it," he said. "Either I knew a player's 
name or his number. It wasn't important to connect the two." 
</P>
<P>
It was in June of 1989 that Dick Ebersol, NBC sports' new president, and Terry 
O'Neil, the new executive producer, approached Walsh about a job. They never 
offered him anything but the No. 1 commentator's job alongside Dick Enberg. 
</P>
<P>
Five months earlier, Walsh had stepped down as coach of the 49ers and taken the 
position of executive vice president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol and O'Neil believed that they had to go to him with their best shot. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say, 'Bill, we'd like you to do four or five regional games on our 
seventh team the first two years and we'll see if you're any good,' " O'Neil 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we were fortunate to get him. If that means that he got thrown into 
the fire a little sooner than we'd like, so be it. He's been through pressure 
situations before." 
</P>
<P>
But Walsh wasn't prepared for this kind of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pressure all right," he said. "It may be a different kind of pressure 
than I was used to, but it's pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was naive. I never realized that the announcing teams were given 
numbers -- the No. 1 team, the No. 2 team and so on. That's very important to 
the people in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I used to think Madden worked a lot of our games just because he lived 
in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he was stunned by the egos and the politicking in his new 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't aware of it," he said. "There are some very nice people in this 
business, but there are some people who think they set the standards for 
broadcasting. I've been amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Are the egos bigger than in coaching? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say so, although there's some pretty big egos in coaching, too. I don't 
want to name names, but I can think of a couple of coaches who just can't 
resist drawing attention to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh is courteous and easy to like. During a two-hour interview over breakfast 
at an Anaheim hotel, a fan would occasionally come by to say hello or ask for 
an autograph. Walsh would go out of his way to make the person feel at ease, 
always saying, "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh comes to Southern California frequently. He is a native of Los Angeles. 
His mother, Ruth, lives in Huntington Beach, and he has a sister there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh attended Los Angeles Washington High, where he was the B-team quarterback 
when a senior named Hugh McElhenny was the star of the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh was the starting varsity quarterback as a junior, but his father, who was 
in the auto body repair and painting business, moved the family to Oregon with 
three games remaining in the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Walsh family moved again, this time to Hayward in the Bay Area, where Bill 
finished high school. By then, because of his 10-flat speed in the 100, he had 
been converted to a running back. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, it was on to San Mateo Junior College and then San Jose 
State, where he played both offense and defense as an end. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, his first coaching job, in 1957, was at Washington High -- but 
in Fremont, not Los Angeles. He took over a team that was 1-26, and by his 
second season had a 9-1 conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Later there were assistant coaching jobs with California, the Raiders, 
Stanford, the Cincinnati Bengals and the San Diego Chargers before he became 
head coach at Stanford in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he became coach of the 49ers, again turning a loser into a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is facing a different kind of challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I could never be another John Madden," he said. "I could never copy his 
style. I just hope that people become accustomed to the way I do a game and 
that someday my style will be the accepted style."

NFL SAYS IT WILL REVIEW SCRAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL announced Tuesday that its decision to scramble its fall telecasts is 
being "reviewed" by the league and the television networks. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of everything that's happened, we need to review the situation," said 
Greg Aiello, the NFL's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
"We're reviewing the scrambling issue with the networks, and no games will be 
scrambled until that review is completed." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Aiello said the NFL remains committed to scrambling, not only to 
preserve the relationship of the major networks to local affiliates -- whose 
advertising is not seen via satellite "feeds" -- but also to "prevent bars and 
restaurants from stealing our private signals (by using satellite dishes). 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone agrees that that is against the law, and we're just trying to 
find the proper way to enforce it."

WAIVERS BACKFIRE AS COLTS GRAB HERRMANN; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: ROBINSON WILL GO WITH TWO QUARTERBACKS. MICKEY SUTTON IS PICKED UP FROM 
THE BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, who have spent much of the summer watching their schemes scrambled by 
injuries, saw yet another plan go awry Tuesday when the Indianapolis Colts 
claimed veteran quarterback Mark Herrmann off the waiver wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did, however, use the wire to improve their situation at cornerback, 
picking up veteran Mickey Sutton from Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson had intended to keep three quarterbacks, with Herrmann and 
Chuck Long backing up starter Jim Everett. But injuries reduced his flexibility 
in trimming the roster to 47, and the Rams waived Herrmann, in the hope he 
would slip through and they could re-sign him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing to us," Robinson said. "We hated to lose Mark. He's a 
great guy and was really in tune with the timing part of our game. But we 
didn't have a lot of options available to us (because of injuries) and felt it 
was the area that would least impact our team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised, frankly, that the Colts would take him, since they have two 
quarterbacks (rookie Jeff George and veteran Jack Trudeau). So, we'll go with 
two quarterbacks and begin to look at disaster quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann wasn't exactly happy with the way things worked out, but he does live 
in Indianapolis and, as he pointed out Tuesday, "At least I still have a job." 
</P>
<P>
He said that when the Rams traded for Long, he thought he might be out of work 
and decided the best he could do was try to make cutting him a difficult 
decision. In fact, he played so well during the exhibition season -- completing 
16 of 30 passes for 212 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions -- that 
he probably hurt his chances of going unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams gave me a fair chance, and I think I played well enough to be the 
backup," Herrmann said. "I talked to Coach Robinson, and he felt the same way. 
He just felt I had a better chance of getting through waivers than Chuck did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little surprised I was picked up, but the Colts wanted a No. 3 guy with 
experience who could jump in and play." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are now without that experienced No. 3. Herrmann said he thinks they 
are taking a risk. 
</P>
<P>
"With this system, it takes a while," he said. "And we didn't even scratch the 
surface in training camp. Chuck has some ability, that's obvious, but you can't 
just jump in and feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, however, is feeling considerably more comfortable with his secondary 
and special teams, thanks to the addition of Sutton and the news that 
cornerback Alfred Jackson's injured groin should keep him out of action only 
one week, instead of a month or more as was originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
Either Sutton, who played with the Rams for three seasons, 1986-88, or safety 
Anthony Newman will start at left corner in Sunday's opener against Green Bay. 
Sutton will also return punts. 
</P>
<P>
"We know Mickey and we know what kind of a person he is," Robinson said. "He 
will help us. He will definitely play in the nickel (defense) and we'll wait 
and see who opens at left corner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' roster has 46 players, so they will be looking over the waiver wire 
for a special teams player. . . . As expected, cornerback Jerry Gray, 
linebacker Larry Kelm and cornerback Darryl Henley were put on injured reserve 
Tuesday, Gray and Kelm with knee injuries, Henley with a hip problem. They will 
be eligible to return in four weeks. . . . Tackle Jackie Slater, who dislocated 
his big toe Friday night against Washington, will be outfitted with a toe plate 
in an effort to relieve some of the stress and pain. John Robinson said Slater 
is doubtful for Sunday's game in Green Bay. . . . Guard Joe Milinichik had a 
pin inserted in his thumb, but will probably play, wearing a cast, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Cleveland Gary, who has missed most of the last month because of 
lower-back pain, has declared himself ready for the season opener. "I think 
he'll be surprised when I don't start him," Robinson said, laughing. "But he's 
got a little work to do before he's ready. We'll try to get him some action in 
the game, but that's hard to do when we don't feel he's prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's assessment of his starting wide receivers, both of whom are 
recovering from hamstring injuries: "Henry Ellard is OK and Flipper Anderson is 
almost OK." . . . Robinson was asked why he chose to protect fourth tight end 
Jim Price, a rookie from Stanford who has a hamstring injury and will probably 
go on injured reserve this week, instead of Herrmann. "We think Price is a 
prospect and unless he makes the 47, you're going to lose him," Robinson said. 
"It was decision about the future." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Greene has practiced for only one day, but says he thinks stamina will 
not be a problem Sunday. Robinson, however, said he intends to make sure Greene 
does not get too tired against the Packers. "I fear injury a little because he 
plays very hard," he said. "There's a fanaticism to his play. He's out there 
slightly over the edge."

TRUMPETING THE TROUT; 
</P>
<P>
LOCALS CLAIM CROWLEY LAKE FISHING HAS BEEN BETTER THAN MOST REALIZE

Matt Nitschke, a fishing guide based in Bishop, was recounting an experience at 
one of his favorite fishing holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I went in about 3 o'clock to experiment with some lures," he said. "I used a 
yellow and white crappie rig with a little sparkle, and by 5 o'clock I almost 
left because I was so tired and my arms were so sore from catching fish. 
</P>
<P>
"I released 20 browns in the 14- to 16-inch range and brought home a 21-inch 
rainbow that took me 15 minutes to land." 
</P>
<P>
When his spinning reel jammed, Nitschke switched to a fly rod, "and I probably 
lost another 10 or 15 because I couldn't hammer the hook in good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nitschke was float-tubing on the Crooked Creek arm at the south end of Crowley 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley Lake? In the good old days? 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Fishing has been pretty good this year," Nitschke said -- an opinion echoed by 
those who didn't give up on Crowley when the Eastern Sierra fishery fell on 
hard times in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Trout fishing was excellent, the best in 10 or 15 years (with) consistently 
big fish all the way to July 31," said Dave Griffith, who manages the 
concessions for the Los Angeles City Department of Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable locals are encouraged, with reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best fishing seasons for trout we've had in four or five years," 
said George O'Nan, who has a trailer park at Crowley and a boat business down 
the hill in Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Witters, who runs a lodge at Crowley, said: "Fishing was good all season 
-- probably because there weren't many fishermen on opening weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Crowley. Once it was regarded as the crown jewel of the Eastern Sierra, 
not for its beauty -- the banks are barren -- but for the quality of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
But when Crowley stopped producing, many fishermen went elsewhere. Griffith 
said only about 5,500 came for the traditional opening day last April, down 
from 9,500 in 1989 and a big decrease from previous years. Traffic has been 
light all summer. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Department of Fish and Game -- whenever it finds the funding -- 
continues to study the lake to see why the fishing diminished, some locals 
whose businesses depend on income from visiting anglers claimed that L.A.'s 
management of the lake was designed to drive folks away. They blamed the 
unreasonable fishing hours, high rental fees for boats, run-down facilities and 
surly employees, but mostly they blamed the seemingly poor fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen would put up with a lot for great fishing, but the word went out: The 
big fish were gone. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, the locals say. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know what you're doing, you'll catch fish there," Nitschke said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Nan published a small handbook titled: "How to Catch Fish in Lake Crowley." 
Inside, the pages are blank. 
</P>
<P>
But, O'Nan said, even 1989 "was the best year we've had on this lake in 20 
years, but you've got to be a fisherman to catch 'em." 
</P>
<P>
There are other factors as well: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOAT FEES 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Department of Water and Power owns the lake; Recreation and Parks runs 
it and sets the rates. 
</P>
<P>
Boats with motors rent for $50 a day until July 1 and $40 thereafter, the 
highest rates recorded in a survey of several lakes but not far out of line. On 
opening weekend the half-day rates have been $50 mornings and $40 afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said the afternoon rates will be eliminated next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We (started) that back in '83 when tons of fish were being caught and people 
could catch a limit in that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those with their own boats, there is a $75 inspection fee, which has caused 
a lot of U-turns at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
No other lake charges an inspection fee. Griffith said it is a misnomer and a 
misunderstanding because it is usually paid at the time a visitor has his boat 
inspected for safety. 
</P>
<P>
It's actually a lake-use fee, and it's good for the 120-day season, comparing 
with the $55 fee Big Bear Lake charges for the full year. A boat owner has the 
options of paying $10 a day or fees of $35 for April and May, then decreasing 
monthly to $20 for August. 
</P>
<P>
The real downside is that all of the revenue goes into Recreation and Parks' 
general fund, where it's used to support non-revenue programs, such as L.A. 
recreation centers, and not enough returns to Crowley for maintenance and 
capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOURS 
</P>
<P>
From opening day until Aug. 1, Crowley's gates open at 6 a.m. and close at 7 
p.m. -- well before dark. From Aug. 1 until Labor Day, the hours are 8 a.m. -- 
well after first light -- to 7 p.m., and the gates remain locked Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Most lakes don't even have gates. 
</P>
<P>
"Any fisherman knows the fish start (biting) at first light," O'Nan said. 
</P>
<P>
Nitschke: "And give 'em until 9 (p.m.). Your brown fishing is early morning and 
late. They've taken trophy trout time away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith has heard these complaints before. 
</P>
<P>
"In late July, we worked on special evenings to keep the lifeguards an hour 
longer. Maybe five people came out. Next year, we're going to try to have some 
special weekends in July and August when we could keep the lake open an extra 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
Paying lifeguards and buying lifeguard boats is expensive. Most lakes don't 
even have lifeguards, except those that also have water skiing and sailing, as 
Crowley has. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said: "It's a recreational lake with conditions that necessitate a 
lifeguard service, (especially) when winds come up on this size lake." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has seen high winds sweep Crowley into a North Sea froth would not 
question the wisdom of hiring lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had one death on this lake since the county had it, back when 
those two water skiers were killed (in the mid-1970s)," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fishing season is open until Oct. 31, boating stops on Labor Day, 
when the drive-in gates are locked -- mainly for lack of interest, Griffith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at us now. We're losing money every day in August. We're here primarily 
for the water skiers, the jet skiers and the sailors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PERCH 
</P>
<P>
The locals love the Sacramento perch that share the lake with the trout. There 
is no limit, and they are good eating. 
</P>
<P>
But the perch disappeared this year, a phenomenon signaled by a die-off of more 
than a thousand starting last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is sure why the perch died. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the ones I saw were over two pounds," Nitschke said. "I think they 
just died of old age." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Milliron, a DFG fishery biologist, thinks the perch will come back, too, 
judging by the volume of perch fry in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
With the four-year drought, Crowley is at less than half capacity, but minimal 
flows mandated recently have somewhat stabilized the level and restored the 
weeds where the perch spawn. 
</P>
<P>
That's what helped Nitschke catch all those trout last week. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fry are hanging around the algae for protection," Nitschke said. "The 
trout are cruising the edges of the weed beds and taking the ones that come out 
too far." 
</P>
<P>
So, Nitschke advises, a smart angler will toss the lure "as close to that algae 
as you can." 
</P>
<P>
The DFG regulations for Crowley change on Aug. 1, when the limit drops from the 
standard five trout to only two 18 inches or longer. The float-tubing fly 
fishermen don't mind; they release their catches, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And Nitschke says it's a good regulation because "when you start getting into 
the fall, you'd lose a lot of the smaller ones that are coming in to spawn." 
</P>
<P>
For the big ones, Nitschke and O'Nan advise trolling deep out in the lake, "and 
most people aren't fishing really deep," Nitschke said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Nan said: "If they'd let us use live bait, we'd bring in some 30-pounders. 
We'd set a California record. Our electronics (fish-finder graphs) show us 
they're in there. People that don't know the lake but have electronics claim 
there are alligators in there. That's how big they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, I think they're going to have one of the best fishing seasons ever 
at Crowley Lake, regardless of what the water level is -- probably a 
record-breaking season."

FISH REPORT: VIRGINIA LAKES ENLIVENED BY PRIVATE TROUT PLANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fishing is slow at some Eastern Sierra locations, but there are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
At Virginia Lakes in the Bridgeport area, trout plants of fish between two and 
five pounds from a private hatchery have supplemented Department of Fish and 
Game plants, making for excellent fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fishermen using black nymphs at nearby Lobdell Lake have learned 
that the grayling season has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting a fish per cast, almost," said Rick Rockel of Ken's Sporting 
Goods in Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
Lobdell Lake, west of Bridgeport in the Sweetwater Mountains, is California's 
only grayling fishery.

VICTORVILLE HATCHERY MAY GET A REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A victim of budget cuts, the Mojave River state fish hatchery was ordered 
closed last month, its 200,000 pounds of rainbow trout earmarked for premature 
release into Southland reservoirs. A new stocking schedule was drawn for future 
plants: reductions by half at some locations, elimination at others. 
</P>
<P>
It was sad news for trout fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
But now comes word that the hatchery at Victorville, the primary facility for 
Southern California waters, may not close after all. In fact, chances are good 
that it won't, thanks to the legislature's last-minute passage Saturday of two 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"If those bills are enacted (signed by the Governor before Sept. 30) and they 
restore the amount of money that we were at the time estimating -- in the 
neighborhood of $8-$8 1/2 million -- we would agree to allocate some of that 
restored money back to keeping the Mojave hatchery open," said Vern Goehring, 
legislative coordinator for the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Bill 3158, if signed into law, will set up a fee structure for 
environmental reviews performed by the DFG under the California Environmental 
Quality Act and bring to the department additional revenue from fine and user 
increases, part of which would be an increase in the price of one-day fishing 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Jan. 31, AB 3158 will raise about $4.6 million for the current fiscal 
year. In a full year, the DFG estimates this source to be worth $10.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
AB 2126 would take effect Jan. 1 and would increase commercial fish business 
license fees and fishing fees and generate an estimated $3.5 million this 
fiscal year. AB 2126 has a one-year life -- written as such to help gain its 
passage -- and Goehring said another bill must be introduced next year to 
assure this source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills were passed in the final hours of a legislative session that lasted 
into the early hours of Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Goehring said the Mojave River hatchery would receive an estimated $800,000 
annually from these added sources, representing 80% to 90% of the necessary 
operating costs, and the department would allocate the rest. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the hatchery's trout have already been dumped into various 
reservoirs as the facility was trying to empty its ponds by the Oct. 1 closing 
deadline. But now orders have changed and the hatchery is returning to "as 
normal a stocking schedule as possible," said Ken Hashagen, hatchery 
coordinator for the DFG in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Duck populations remain near all-time lows. Therefore the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service has proposed to continue restrictive hunting regulations this 
fall, and Southern California figures to be one of the more restricted areas. 
</P>
<P>
The projected fall flight index -- based on surveys of duck breeding 
populations -- of 64 million ducks, about the same as last year, is the third 
lowest since the FWS began making projections in 1969. Prolonged drought 
conditions in prairie nesting areas and destruction of wetlands throughout the 
continent are responsible for record low duck populations in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Hunters in the Southern California zone face the likelihood of a split season, 
from Oct. 13 to Nov. 7 and from Dec. 6 to Jan. 6; shooting hours from a 
half-hour before sunrise to sunset; a daily bag limit of four, including no 
more than three mallards (only one hen), one pintail, and either two 
canvasbacks, two redheads, or one of each. Hunters may have eight ducks in 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Goose season figures to run between Oct. 13 to Jan. 13, with hunters allowed 
six a day, six in possession, not more than three white or three dark, of which 
not more than two may be Canada geese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
SHARKS -- A record 328 tags from 19 species of sharks were returned in 1989 as 
part of a 27-year-old National Marine Fisheries Program. Highlights -- as 
printed in the International Game Fish Assn.'s bi-monthly newsletter -- for a 
year in which 5,623 sharks were tagged include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sand bar shark that had spent more than 24 years at liberty since being 
tagged in Delaware Bay on Dec. 29, 1965. It was recaptured by a long-line 
vessel in the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 5, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A bigeye thresher shark that had traveled 1,400 miles, and an oceanic 
whitetip shark that was recovered 1,200 miles from its tag site. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A blue shark that had traveled at a rate of 44 miles a day. About 10% of 
blue sharks recaptured had traveled more than 1,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Recreational fishermen accounted for 66% of the sharks tagged in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
SALTWATER FISHING -- Albacore are still being taken by fishermen aboard San 
Diego's overnight fleet, but the bite is anything but wide open. Those aboard 
the Pacific Dawn returned Tuesday morning with 19 of the long-fin tuna in the 
20-pound range, 30 yellowfin tuna to 30 pounds, 48 dorado and a few yellowtail. 
John Shull, the boat's owner-skipper, said some of the floating kelp paddies 
found 55 miles south of the landings are holding tremendous volumes of fish 
underneath, while others are not. "It's just a matter of finding the right 
paddy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FLY FISHING -- At Bob Marriott's store in Fullerton: Phil Eubanks teaches 1 
1/2-day introductory classes each weekend in September; Charlene Hanson, basic 
fly tying Monday nights and advanced classes Friday nights. Details: (714) 
525-1827.

SHOWS -- Newport fall boat shows at Lido Marina Yachting Center in Newport 
Beach: used boats, Thursday-Sunday; new powerboats and sailboats, Sept. 12-16.

T K'S SKIPPER TURNS IN FASTEST MILE OF YEAR BEFORE HEADING WEST TO RACE IN 
PACING CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
T K's Skipper, the leading older pacer in North America, ran a 1:49 1/5 time 
trial Saturday at Du Quoin, Ill., the fastest mile of the year in harness 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
But trainer Nick Sodano thought he could have gone faster. 
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter was a little slow and he threw a shoe at the half," Sodano 
said this week from his New Jersey headquarters. "I would have been happy to 
break 1:50, but people were talking world record." 
</P>
<P>
The record is 1:48 2/5, set by Matt's Scooter in a time trial at the Lexington 
(Ky.) Red Mile in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper, a 5-year-old son of Governor Skipper, had fractions of 28 1/5, 
55 and 1:21 4/5 with regular driver Mike Lachance. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper will arrive at Los Alamitos today from Illinois to compete in the 
American Pacing Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't race this Saturday," Sodano said. "We'll catch the second leg. He'll 
race again in the third leg and the final." 
</P>
<P>
The American Pacing Classic, restored to Southern California after a nine-year 
absence, returns Saturday with the $35,000 first leg. The series continues with 
$35,000 legs Sept. 15 and Sept. 22. Point leaders qualify for the $150,000 
final at one mile Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper has won 16 of 23 starts this year and earned $488,362. He won the 
U.S. Pacing Championship at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., Aug. 17 
in 1:50 3/5, the fastest standardbred mile this year in a race. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamitos track record is 1:53 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Guida's Keystone Raider, winner of the American-National Pace in 1:53 2/5 
Saturday at Sportsman's Park in Chicago, is also scheduled in today for Classic 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Already on the grounds are J.A. Bedford from Maryland, B. Crafty from Toronto, 
Tiger Pilot from British Columbia and Dare You To from New Jersey. Dare You To 
raced at Los Alamitos last spring. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper is probably the best standardbred to visit California since 
Forrest Skipper won the 1986 Breeders' Crown at Los Alamitos en route to 
horse-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
The $15,000 invitational pace capped a bizarre Saturday night during a 
nightmarish week at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
First, a virus hit the stable area during mid-week, resulting in wholesale 
scratches that devastated fields. There were 10 scratches on Thursday and 15 
each on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational was reduced to four horses because of three scratches, 
including co-favorites Speedy Alba and Vance Lobell. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the starters, Riviera Hanover and Winning Night, were trained by Rick 
Plano and coupled in the betting. The other starters were Power and Glory and 
Absolute Gem. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera Hanover, driven by Gene Vallandingham, led all the way. In the stretch, 
however, he veered off the rail and into the path of Power and Glory. Power and 
Glory stepped into Riviera Hanover's right wheel, stumbled, went into a break 
just before the wire and fell after the finish. Winning Night, driven by Plano, 
came up along the rail to cross the wire second. Power and Glory was third. 
</P>
<P>
Power and Glory lay motionless on the track for several moments, tangled in his 
lines, before regaining his feet. 
</P>
<P>
A furious Jim Todd, 57, the horse's driver-trainer, went after Vallandingham on 
the track when Vallandingham, 49, brought Riviera Hanover back to the winner's 
circle, but several horsemen stepped in before any punches were thrown.

<P>
After reviewing films, stewards disqualified both Riviera Hanover and Winning 
Night and moved Power and Glory up to first. The horse was taken to the 
winner's circle for a picture, minus sulky and saddlecloth. 
</P>
<P>
"Riviera Hanover drifted into Todd's horse and let the other half of the entry 
come up on the rail, thus aiding the other half of the entry," steward Jack 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't that mad in a long time, maybe years," Todd said the other day. "It 
was obvious Gene was trying to bear out from the rail to let Plano go up and 
get the stablemates 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned that my horse was hurt. Luckily, he appears to be OK. He cut 
his foot a little and got the wind knocked out of him but I walked him the day 
after the race and I hope to make the first leg of the American Pacing Classic 
Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Power and Glory, a 7-year-old gelding, was running for only the second time 
this season, having been sidelined since May because of a broken knee. 
</P>
<P>
Because Power and Glory broke stride shortly before the wire and was more than 
a length ahead of fourth-place Absolute Gem, he was not disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Later on the Saturday card, a three-horse chain-reaction spill marred the 
seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
Mighty Buster broke stride in mid-pack at the top of the stretch with Donald 
Dancer. West Side Story, with Steve Desomer, and Pasadena Phantom, handled by 
Jim Butler, were unable to avoid the breaking pacer. All escaped unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, horsemen were hopeful that their ailing horses would recover quickly 
from the virus, which primarily struck New Zealand imports. The barns of Ross 
Croghan, Bob Johnson and Bob Gordon were especially hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a new bug that hit," Gordon said. "Five of the 18 in my barn got it. 
The first two were horses that had been here a year from New Zealand. It's an 
upper respiratory problem, a cough that sounds like it's down deep. I've been 
using antibiotics to get the temperature down and an old cold remedy with honey 
and lemon to lessen the cough." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope within a week to have the barn rolling again. This is really bad for a 
horse like Speedy Alba. I wanted to race him in that $35,000 race (the first 
leg of the American Pacing Classic), but even if he makes it back Saturday, he 
won't be sharp." 
</P>

The Pacesetter yearling sale is scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. at Los Alamitos. 
A total of 66 horses are scheduled to be sold. Of particular interest will be 
So Fast, a son of Hunter's Star and Soso. He is a full brother to Supernal, who 
earned $232,000; Oso Speedy, who won $151,000, and SoSo Beach, who won a 
$16,712 California Breeders' Stake for 2-year-old filly trotters last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oso Speedy, a 9-year-old gelding, raced for the first time in three years last 
week, finishing second in a $6,000 claiming race. "I bought him for $850 at a 
2-year-old sale and he made $150,000," said owner-trainer-driver Paul Keays. 
"He's had suspensory problems, and this is the third time we've tried to bring 
him back." At least he knows he will always have a good home. "I had been 
riding him on the trails and swimming him in a lake," said Keays' wife, Joanne. 
"If he breaks down again, he will be my permanent riding horse." 
</P>
<P>
A win payoff that was worth more than the triple occurred on Friday night. 
Heavily favored Lepton won the first race and paid $2.10. Two in a Teepee won 
the second and returned $2.60. Gee Gee Gem won the third race and paid $8.20. 
The triple was worth only $7.00. . . . Donald Dancer, recently arrived from the 
East, won his first two races in California Friday.

2 KIDNAPED GIRLS SPOTTED BY TV NEWS CREW, RESCUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A 16-year-old mentally disabled girl was reunited with her mother Tuesday less 
than 24 hours after she and a 12-year-old playmate were kidnaped at a Labor Day 
church outing in a South Gate park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A television crew spotted the two girls and their alleged abductors Tuesday 
afternoon, only minutes after leaving a South Gate police press conference to 
announce the girls' disappearance, said Sgt. Russ Galbreath. 
</P>
<P>
Police freed the girls and arrested two suspects without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Sanchez of Cudahy and Emily Garcia of Paramount had been abducted at 
8:05 p.m. Monday from the parking lot at South Gate City Park as Emily's 
mother, Elizabeth Mosqueda, watched helplessly, police said. Emily has the 
mental capacity of an 8-year-old, Galbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Mosqueda had given her daughter the keys to retrieve a purse 
from the trunk of her car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosqueda "saw an unknown man backing her car out of one of the parking stalls 
and at the same time pushing her daughter into the car," Galbreath said. As the 
car sped north on Hildreth Avenue, Mosqueda briefly ran after the vehicle, 
screaming out her daughter's name. 
</P>
<P>
Mosqueda flagged down a passing South Gate police patrol car, and detectives 
began searching the neighborhood, police said. Detectives released photographs 
of the girls and descriptions of the car at the Tuesday afternoon press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
At about 4 p.m., a news crew from Spanish-language television station KVEA, 
Channel 52, spotted the car at a gas station at the corner of Atlantic Avenue 
and Firestone Boulevard, less than two blocks from the park where the girls had 
been abducted, Galbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew called 911 on their cellular phone, and police arrived at the scene a 
few minutes later, Galbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls were at the service station along with two men, who were arrested in 
connection with the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Perez, 18, and Alfredo Torres, 23, were being held Tuesday at the South 
Gate Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each. They were both charged with kidnaping, 
robbery and auto theft, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't been injured," Galbreath said of the two girls. "They're pretty 
shaken up. One girl had been crying."

City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay appeared to be "doing better" today and was 
taken off a respirator but remained hospitalized after suffering an apparent 
stroke over the weekend, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay aide Robert Gay said he expected to learn later in the day the results 
of medical tests undertaken to pinpoint Lindsay's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 89, left paralyzed on the right side, had been relaxing at his home 
late Sunday night when he was stricken, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th District councilman was placed in intensive care at Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he remains. He is still unable to speak 
but is breathing on his own.

The North and South Korean prime ministers met today to pave the road to Korean 
unity, but each side apparently rejected the other's main proposals and agreed 
to meet again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon joined his northern counterpart, 
Yon Hyong Muk, for the two-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
Kang proposed that the Koreas allow cross-border travel on major holidays, 
restore communications and travel links, reunite families and reduce armed 
forces to equal levels. 
</P>
<P>
But North Korea said "military and political confrontation" on the peninsula 
should be ended before all else. 
</P>
<P>
Yon demanded that Seoul release three dissidents jailed for illegal trips to 
North Korea, end annual joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers and share a 
single seat at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea said that was not acceptable.

BODY FOUND IN BACK SEAT OF CAR

<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a woman that was found this morning in the back seat of a car 
alongside a busy Van Nuys street went unreported for three or four days, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old woman who lived in a home nearby is believed to have died of 
natural causes, Detective James Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Her name was not released pending notification of her family. She was found by 
a passerby about 1 a.m. in the back seat of her car parked in the 6600 block of 
Hazeltine Avenue, Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
The passerby called the Fire Department and paramedics, who initially examined 
the body and notified the Police Department that the woman could have been shot 
in the head. But detectives determined that decomposition of the body led to 
the erroneous conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that the woman died sometime over the weekend. An autopsy will 
determine the cause of death.

NO CLUES YET TO WHEREABOUTS OF 90-YEAR-OLD LAGUNA HILLS MAN

<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department and the wife of a missing 90-year-old 
Laguna Hills man remained baffled today about his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Adams, who lives in Leisure World with his 87-year-old wife, Alice, was 
last seen driving his red and white 1978 Cadillac El Dorado near the 
intersection of Alicia Parkway and Jeronimo Road at 3:45 p.m. Tuesday, 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was trailing a friend driving another car when he apparently made a wrong 
turn, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, deputies have been scouring the region where he disappeared and 
have put out a missing persons bulletin to local and out-of-state agencies. 
Sheriff's investigators do not suspect foul play, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had things like this before," Olson said. "And they do show up in some 
strange places. He could have gone far and wide."

FATAL STABBING IN SUBWAY WAS INITIATION RITE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eight young men arrested in the stabbing death of a tourist from Utah in a 
subway station belonged to a gang that required would-be members to mug someone 
as an initiation rite, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Former members said the gang robbed people "for the hell of it" and to get 
money to go dancing, the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
The youth suspected of wielding the murder weapon has claimed that the victim, 
Brian Watkins, 22, ran into his knife and that the stabbing was accidental, New 
York Newsday and the New York Post quoted police as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday said the suspect, Yull Garry Morales, 18, told investigators: "There 
was fighting. I took out my knife to protect myself and the guy turned and it 
went into him." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Watkins had come to his family's defense late Sunday as they waited 
for a subway train when gang members sliced open his father's pants and punched 
his mother in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The gang took credit cards and about $200 in cash to go dancing, police said. 
After the stabbing, the gang headed to a nearby dance club, where five of the 
suspects were arrested. Three others were seized later. 
</P>
<P>
The Watkins family was in New York on an annual visit to see the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins was the 18th person slain in the subway system this year. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe gang founder Morales stabbed Watkins and imposed the 
initiation. Morales was one of two gang members who did not have a police 
record.

Nonsmokers who grew up with smoking parents face double the usual risk of lung 
cancer, according to a study that provides new evidence of the dangers of 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that 17% of all lung cancer in the United States among 
people who never smoked cigarettes results from their exposure to smokers 
during childhood and adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is another piece of evidence that smoke from other people's cigarettes is 
harmful to your health. This is the first finding that indicates that exposure 
early in life may be particularly important," said Dr. Dwight T. Janerich of 
Yale School of Medicine, who directed the study.

Police and animal shelter officials said today that they are worried that the 
disappearance of dozens of cats in Lincoln County may mean that the animals are 
being stolen either for medical research or satanic rituals. 
</P>
<P>
No one has found any evidence that the cats are being sacrificed or sold to 
medical labs, officials said. But they said the sheer number of missing cats 
indicates that something out of the ordinary is happening to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Harford, manager of the Lincoln County Animal Shelter, said more than 50 
cats have been reported missing since mid-July. Most of the cats have 
disappeared during daylight hours from porches, driveways, yards and other 
areas near their homes.

IBM INTRODUCES NEW LINE OF MAINFRAME COMPUTERS

International Business Machines Corp., aiming to tighten its grip on the 
mainframe computer market, today introduced the Enterprise System/9000 line, 
ranging from intermediate computers for office environments to its most 
powerful mainframe systems ever. 
</P>
<P>
The unveiling came one day after Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., the world's No. 2 
producer, unveiled a new series of mainframe computers it called the world's 
fastest. 
</P>
<P>
But IBM's powerful new line is expected to deliver more than sheer horsepower 
to customers who have outgrown its current 3090 J models. 
</P>
<P>
"ES/9000 has the industry's broadest single-family range of performance and 
upgrade options," said the company, based in Armonk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The new machines range in price from $70,480 to $22.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said its new top-end model will be the most powerful computer on the 
market; however, this model will not be available until the third quarter of 
1991. Many of the lower-level models will be available later this year or early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts had said making available an enhanced 3090 J soon is meant to 
keep customers in the IBM fold until the more advanced machines are ready. 
</P>
<P>
"The new generation can be customized," said Rick Martin, who tracks IBM for 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It's a total change in strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Mainframe computers, long used by large customers to store and manipulate 
massive amounts of data, have not been made to talk to each other easily. But 
IBM's new machines, in addition to providing extra power, are expected to have 
the capacity to be linked together, sharing data and programs. 
</P>
<P>
This recognizes a growing consumer demand for connectivity and compatibility, 
analysts say. But even with the souped-up mainframes, IBM faces competition as 
an increasing number of companies turn to cheaper personal computers linked in 
local area networks. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said the ES/9000 processors share advanced architectures, a compatible 
family of operating systems and many common functions. 
</P>
<P>
These would enable customers to be able to increase programmer and end-user 
productivity significantly, handle more data in less time, improve current 
applications and facilitate development of new, high-potential applications for 
competitive advantage.

Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries PLC said today that its 
profits fell 11% in the first half of the year due largely to huge insurance 
claims for storm damage last winter in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Britain's fourth largest, announced pretax profits of $1.1 billion 
for the year to June 30 against $1.3 billion for the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Operating profits from BAT's financial services, including its insurance units, 
Farmers Group in California and Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in Britain, 
plummeted to $486 million from $782 million in the first six months of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But BAT, whose initials refer to its roots as British American Tobacco, managed 
a big gain in its tobacco units, whose operating profit jumped to $896 million 
from $754 million.

Yugoslavia's financially troubled 6-year-old venture for exporting cheap-priced 
Yugo cars to the United States is unlikely to last another two years under 
current conditions, a top Yugoslav government official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be good to push this project when there is no demand in 
the U.S. market," Kazimir Zivko Pregl, the vice president of Yugoslavia's 
Federal Executive Council, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Zastava began exporting its low-priced Yugo subcompact car based on an old Fiat 
model to the United States in 1985 in a major effort to earn hard currency by 
undercutting cheaper Asian cars sold here. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an initial flurry of publicity from the novelty of a new car priced 
around $4,000 and optimistic predictions by its original principals, sales 
never reached the level projected. 
</P>
<P>
By 1989, annual sales totaled only 10,576, a 66% plunge from 1988 levels.

Mark Gastineau's comeback attempt with the British Columbia Lions ended Tuesday 
when the former NFL All-Star was released by the team and waived through the 
Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old defensive end failed to keep a morning appointment with head 
coach Lary Kuharich. 
</P>
<P>
He cleared CFL waivers after none of the other seven teams claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he is," Kuharich said after practice. "It's over, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Gastineau played 10 seasons with the New York Jets and played in five Pro Bowls 
before walking out on the NFL team during the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions signed Gastineau before the 1990 CFL season at the insistence of 
owner Murray Pezim, the Vancouver stock promoter who backed Gastineau's bid to 
become a pro boxer. Gastineau played four league games for the Lions before 
going on the injured list in early August with a rib cartilage problem.

GEORGE BRETT FINDS HIMSELF BACK AT THE TOP OF THE LIST; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE ROYALS VETERAN HAS REGAINED THE STROKE THAT WON TWO BATTING 
TITLES -- AND COULD MAKE HIM A THREE-DECADE AL CHAMP THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago, George Brett hardly could be thinking of a third American 
League batting title. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kansas City first baseman searched through the AL hitters' statistics 
for the week, he began at the bottom of the list to find his name. 
</P>
<P>
Media and fans were convinced he had become just another aging has-been trying 
to hold on in his twilight years. Even Brett had self-doubts, particularly when 
he was demoted from third to fifth in the batting order in early May by manager 
and old friend John Wathan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time in my life a manager called me into his office to say, 
'Hey, you're not really doing the job. We're going to move you back to fifth to 
take a little pressure off,' " Brett said. "I kind of walked out of there going 
'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, the mechanics started to come together. Brett says it happened on 
a couple of foul balls in Boston in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' Willie Wilson, himself an AL batting title winner and Brett's 
teammate for 13 years, says Brett finally got mad at himself, went into the 
dugout tunnel one day, rattled things around and came out recharged. 
</P>
<P>
Royals hitting coach John Mayberry says Brett's swing was there all along -- he 
just got off to a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the theory, the 37-year-old Brett has been sizzling since early July. 
</P>
<P>
He was hitting .266 at Detroit on July 8 when he went on a 16-game streak that 
raised his average to .307 by July 26 at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Now when he checks the batting leaders, he starts at the top. Only Rickey 
Henderson of Oakland (.326) is ahead of Brett's .320 average. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I cannot do is try to go out and win the batting title," Brett 
said. "If I get my hits, I can't worry about what (others) do." 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Palmeiro of Texas trails Brett at .319, followed by Alan Trammell of 
Detroit at .315. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went from .260 to .315, I was hitting .450, .480," Brett said. "I need 
another one of those to get in serious, serious contention, I think." 
</P>
<P>
He last won the batting title in 1980, when he hit .390, the highest average in 
the big leagues since 1941, when Ted Williams hit .406. 
</P>
<P>
Brett won his first title in 1976 (.333), when he collected three hits on the 
final day of the season against Minnesota. It was a showdown with teammate Hal 
McRae and the Twins' Rod Carew. 
</P>
<P>
Wathan, who said he didn't view Brett's move to the No. 5 spot in the order as 
a demotion, is as happy as anyone to see Brett's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"He had some doubts about himself, but it clicked somewhere along the line. He 
wants to prove he hasn't lost it," Wathan said. "The only thing I see 
happening, and I don't think it will, is he could lose patience." 
</P>
<P>
Should Brett win the race, he would become the first player to win three 
batting titles in three different decades. 
</P>
<P>
"To win one when you're 23 years old and turn around and win one when you're 
37, it would be a great feat to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer I'm in this thing, the more I'm going to want to win it."

DONAHUE WOULD SOONER FORGET '86 LOSS TO OKLAHOMA

Yes, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue remembers the game his team played against 
Oklahoma four years ago. No, he doesn't enjoy the memories. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a national championship season, the Sooners demolished the Bruins, 
38-3, at Norman, Okla., in the first game of the 1986 season for both teams. It 
was also the first game between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very lopsided contest, and I'm really not sure the score could have 
been worse had Oklahoma chosen to make it worse," Donahue recalled Tuesday at 
his first weekly meeting with reporters. "That game hurt our football team for 
three or four weeks; we had a lot of injuries." 
</P>
<P>
The teams will meet for the second time Saturday at the Rose Bowl in the first 
game for both this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is 1990, different teams and different coaching staffs," Donahue said. "I 
certainly hope there will be a different outcome. That game (in 1986) was not 
one I reflect back on with any pleasant memories. I'm not going to talk about 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Bruins and Sooners are coming off uncharacteristic seasons, although 
as Donahue said: "They were off the mark a little bit; we were off the mark a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
That's putting it pretty accurately. Under first-year head coach Gary Gibbs, 
Oklahoma went 7-4 last season after going 42-6 the previous four years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UCLA had a 3-7-1 record in Donahue's 14th season as the Bruins' head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
In Donahue's first 13 seasons, the Bruins were 108-38-7 and won an NCAA-record 
seven straight bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question we're going to be a better team this year," 
Donahue said. "There's no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Oklahoma enter the season with one thing in common -- they are the 
only members of the preseason Top 25 that were not ranked at the end of the 
1989 season. The Bruins are ranked 19th and the Sooners 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue responded with a frown to the first question asked of him Tuesday. It 
concerned the team's physical well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to elaborate much on the injury report," he said. "Suffice it to 
say I expect our football team to be a lot healthier four weeks from today than 
we are today." 
</P>
<P>
At least four key Bruins -- wide receiver Scott Miller, linebacker Rocen 
Keeton, cornerback Al Jordan and tight end Corwin Anthony -- definitely will 
not play against Oklahoma because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Among other players who might not go are starting tailback Kevin Williams, who 
has a sprained ankle, and starting safety Eric Turner, who has an injured toe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Lewis said he will return to Hollywood next Labor Day with his Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. telethon after raising a record amount in pledges this year. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials said the 21 1/2-hour show, which ended Monday, raised 
$44.1 million to fight 40 neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple 
thousands each year, most of them young people. Last year's tally was $42.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The telethon regularly breaks its pledge records, but ratings in recent years 
have dropped. Viewing figures are to be released in two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
Producers moved the 25th annual telethon to Los Angeles after 17 years in Las 
Vegas to reduce costs and update the show's image.

Lou Diamond Phillips of "La Bamba" and "Young Guns II" was hospitalized over 
the weekend because of bleeding from a tonsillectomy, his spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old actor was taken by paramedics to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on 
Thursday after losing blood while eating at a restaurant, Eddie Michaels said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a tonsillectomy about two weeks ago, and this was what they call 
residual bleeding," Michaels said. "He actually lost a lot of blood. But he got 
a transfusion and is doing fine right now." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was released from the hospital Monday.

MUSIC CENTER OPERA OPENS WITH A TROUBLED 'FIDELIO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Tuesday, the Music Center Opera opened 
its fifth ambitious season with the glorious pathos of "Fidelio." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Pavilion, the performance-artist Tim Miller and numerous 
colleagues, all clad in striped prison garb, staged their own ironic overture 
to Beethoven's ode to freedom. It was an agitprop demonstration protesting 
governmental interference in the arts. In many ways, the political action on 
the plaza proved more compelling than the political action on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Gotz Friedrich, the celebrated director from Berlin, wrote in a program note 
that "Fidelio" "takes place wherever and whenever terrorism and violence 
threaten mankind." He saw "no basic demand to update the piece" from the 
18th-Century Spain envisioned by the composer. If only he had the courage of 
his aesthetic convictions. 
</P>
<P>
He placed the action in a stylized prison courtyard, dominated by movable 
black-brick walls and a central, all-too-modern guard tower. The prisoners had 
to be concentration-camp inmates. Leonore, disguised as the hardy hero, sported 
blue jeans. The villainous Don Pizarro, who came equipped with de rigueur 
shades, resembled a spidery fusion of Nosferatu and a Storm Trooper. 
Marzelline, the erstwhile soubrette, underwent erotic paroxysms when she 
declared her yearning for Fidelio. Jacquino became a nasty, leather-jacketed 
thug. 
</P>
<P>
One must admire Friedrich's probing intellect. Sometimes, unfortunately, he 
seems inclined to probe too far in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
The theatrical excesses of his "Fidelio" could have been mitigated by inspired 
musical impulses. On this occasion, inspiration turned out to be painfully 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Jiri Kout, the conductor, slighted the majesty, the sweep and the poignancy of 
the score in favor of speed for its own breathless sake. The cast looked fine. 
For the most part, it sounded feeble. 
</P>
<P>
Karan Armstrong -- who happens to be married to Friedrich -- acted the title 
role with fine, muted ardor tinged with telling desperation. Her lyric soprano 
came to grief, however, in the high climaxes. Gary Bachlund sang Florestan with 
the warm, fervent tone of a bona fide junior Heldentenor, but paced himself 
badly. Michael Devlin blustered stoically as the Nazi ogre. 
</P>
<P>
Only one principal sustained world-class standards. Matti Salminen defined the 
usual paternal platitudes with booming basso amplitude, with incisive 
articulation of the German text and with hearty if not too folksy generosity of 
spirit. He towered above his colleagues, both literally and figuratively. If 
only the opera were called "Rocco." 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.

COURT REJECTS BID TO HALT EXHIBIT OF MAPPLETHORPE PHOTOS IN BOSTON

<P>
Opponents of the Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibit lost a bid in court today to 
halt the show that they say violates obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three complaints that 
would have prompted an investigation of the exhibit by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally I wouldn't pay 5 cents" for the pictures, Carr said, but she moved 
quickly to deny the request by the American Family Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The group had sought a ruling that the exhibit -- which includes nude photos of 
children -- is exploitative, constitutes dissemination of obscene materials and 
disseminates matter harmful to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Lesley Pasquini, who filed the complaints against the Institute of Contemporary 
Art, said members of her group will discuss their next step. "We're going to 
keep making people aware of what's going on and what's being pushed before the 
public," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But museum attorney Cassandra Warshowsky said the exhibit is protected. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an exemption in the obscenity statutes for exhibitions in a bona fide 
museum, school or library," Warshowsky said. "In addition to that, this exhibit 
is fully protected under the Constitution -- the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
The Mapplethorpe photos first went on display at the museum five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Cincinnati, the Contemporary Arts Center and its director were charged with 
a misdemeanor count of pandering obscenity for displaying homoerotic pictures 
in the exhibit, which also includes portraits and still lifes of flowers.
