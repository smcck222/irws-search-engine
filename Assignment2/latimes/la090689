TIRAN NERSOYAN; EX-ARMENIAN CHURCH LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan, primate of the Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic 
Church of America from 1944 to 1954, has died of cancer at the age of 85. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10 years as head of the diocese in the United States, 11 new 
churches were established and 21 priests were added. Nersoyan founded the St. 
Nersess Seminary in New Rochelle, N.Y., and served as its dean. 
</P>
<P>
Nersoyan died Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
The naturalized U.S. citizen was born Aug. 23, 1904, in Aintab, Turkey. He 
moved with his family to Syria in 1915 during the massacres of Armenians by the 
Ottoman rulers. 
</P>
<P>
Trained at the Seminary at Jerusalem, he was ordained a priest in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Nersoyan was elected Armenian patriarch of Jerusalem, but his tenure 
ended abruptly in August, 1958, when he was forcibly deported from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
He was seized by Jordan military authorities during a religious procession and 
placed immediately on a plane bound for Beirut. Nersoyan's supporters alleged 
that Jordanian authorities were influenced to deport him by the rival who 
succeeded him as patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include two sisters, Mariam Jebjian of Ft. Lee, N.J., and Teshkhouyn 
Nersoyan of Aleppo, Syria, and a brother, Hagop, of Dayton, Ohio.

ALBERT WINKLER; AUTHORITY ON VITICULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert J. Winkler, one of the nation's foremost authorities on viticulture, 
whose research contributed to the growth of California's wine industry, has 
died in a Davis convalescent hospital. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, Winkler developed a system for classifying the most desirable wine 
grape growing areas in California by using "degree days" -- calculating how 
many days in the April-October growing season each region registered the best 
temperatures for maturing vines. 
</P>
<P>
The system is still in use today. 
</P>
<P>
A Texas native who earned his doctorate in horticulture at UC Berkeley in 1921, 
Winkler spent much of his career as a specialist in wine grapes and wine 
making. 
</P>
<P>
But during the Prohibition era, 1919-33, he switched his research to table 
grapes and in the late 1920s pioneered a sulfur dioxide gassing process that 
made it possible to ship and market California grapes in the East. 
</P>
<P>
After Prohibition, Winkler returned to wine grape research. A UC Davis faculty 
member for four decades, he headed the university's department of viticulture 
from 1935 to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
In his work on degree days, Winkler identified five zones or regions throughout 
the state, with I and II the best for nurturing wine grapes. His Zone I, 
including Oakville in the Napa Valley, was considered comparable to Burgundy, a 
major wine center in France. His Zone II, including most of Napa and Sonoma 
counties, was compared to Bordeaux, another historically fine wine-producing 
section of France. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler's book "General Viticulture," published in 1962, became an 
international text on wine grapes and was translated into several languages. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler continued his research even after he retired from the UC Davis faculty. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was held Tuesday in Davis for Winkler, who died Aug. 29 of 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler is survived by two daughters, Marjorie Morris of Sacramento and Ethel 
Plocher of Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
His wife of 69 years, Pearl Buehrer Winkler, died last year.

CLIFFORD E. VARGAS, 64; KEPT CIRCUS UNDER TENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clifford E. Vargas, whose belief that circuses should be in tents led him to 
found one of the largest circuses under canvas in the world, has died of heart 
failure at his Hollywood Hills home. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
A restless, hyperactive, "hands-on" entrepreneur, Vargas involved himself in 
every aspect of Circus Vargas, taking tickets, tending animals, counseling his 
employees and serving occasionally as ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started out, they knew I was inexperienced," he told an interviewer 
several years ago. "I had my people teach me how to do almost everything, 
including driving the trucks, putting up the tent and the seats, everything. . 
. . That way I could say, 'If the boss can do it, you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
The son of Portuguese immigrants who raised him on a farm near Livermore, 
Vargas said his childhood was pleasant, but "isolated." 
</P>
<P>
"My father and I would get up every morning at 5, milk 40 cows by hand, have 
breakfast, work in the fields, eat dinner at 9 and be in bed by 10," he 
recalled. "The next day, the routine started all over again." 
</P>
<P>
At 20, Vargas left home, trying his hand at a series of odd jobs -- including a 
stint as a Fuller Brush man -- that eventually landed him, eight years later, 
in Chicago. One day, on a lark, he went to the circus. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes got big," he remembered later. "I was really excited." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas said he pestered the owner for a week until the man finally relented and 
gave him a job as an advance man, handling advertising, ticket sales and other 
arrangements. Vargas loved the work, but there was one aspect of the business 
that bothered him -- circuses were abandoning the "big top" because it was too 
expensive, relying instead on rented stadiums and auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
"The circus is a tent," Vargas said. "It was born in a tent. . . . It's not 
like an arena where you're 30 rows back, divorced from the show. In a tent, 
you're 20 feet from the performers. You can see how dangerous it is for people 
on the high wire and you can almost touch the animals. There's just no 
comparison." 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Vargas returned to California, where he worked for several small 
circuses while continuing to save his money for the day when he might own one 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad always told me, 'If you make a dollar, save 50 cents,' " he recalled. 
"I managed to put away quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Vargas used his savings to buy a controlling interest in the 
Miller-Johnson Circus. 
</P>
<P>
"All I really got was the name, some ring curbs and seating, three trucks, some 
outdated electrical equipment and contracts for the rest of the year," he said. 
"I began acquiring animals -- four elephants, some lions and ponies -- and 
bought some trailers and rented a couple of trucks. . . . I sold my house in 
San Francisco to buy the first tent and the equipment needed to put it up." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas' belief in the big top paid off. Today, when the three-ring Circus 
Vargas hits the road, the caravan can include as many as 30 tractor-trailer 
rigs and 58 mobile homes. As many as 150 trained animals appear in the shows, 
which can employ as many as 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Vargas publicists say their tent -- currently erected in Chicago -- is 
the largest circus tent in the world, covering an area the size of a football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when people come to the circus, they leave their troubles behind," 
said Vargas, who served as president of the company. "When it's over, they feel 
wonderful. It puts people in a very, very good mood. . . . There's so much 
going on that's fun. There's nothing bad about the circus, nothing depressing. 
</P>
<P>
"They say circuses are for kids, but that's not exactly true," he added. "The 
bottom line is that people, when they come to the circus, become kids." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas, who died Monday night, was married briefly more than 20 years ago. He 
leaves three brothers: Joe Marshal of Roseburg, Ore., and William Vargas and 
Melvin Vargas, both of whom live in Sonora, Calif., and are involved in the 
corporate operation of the circus. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are pending.

MORE ON CONVENT AT DEATH CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, people often refer to me as the "lucky 
one." But, just how lucky was I? 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1944, the Nazis forced me to leave Auschwitz on a death march to 
escape the Soviet army which was rapidly approaching. But I left behind the 
ashes of my beloved mother and 14-year-old sister, who were murdered there with 
3 million other Jews. Their remains are scattered on the grounds of Auschwitz, 
the largest Jewish burial ground in all the world. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago I finally mustered the courage to return to this holy cemetery. I 
was stunned to see a Catholic convent on these sacred grounds, so saturated 
with Jewish blood. 
</P>
<P>
I realized that the presence of the nuns here was the beginning of the final 
revision of the most infamous Nazi concentration camp, its gas chambers, and 
crematories. 
</P>
<P>
We, the survivors of the Holocaust, will protest!

MORE ON CONVENT AT DEATH CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Pfaff shed some much-needed light on the Polish feelings about the 
Carmelite convent near Auschwitz ("Poles Suffered Too, but Justice Seems to 
Give Jews Deciding Word on Auschwitz," Op-Ed, Aug. 28). However, he still 
misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
The convent is outside the camp fence. "The convent lawn is a former gravel pit 
where political prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 
1941" (Times, Part I, July 15). Surely, a majority of those political prisoners 
were Polish Christians. Indeed, ". . . a million Polish Catholics . . . were 
killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz." (Times, Part I, Aug. 16). Auschwitz is, 
therefore, the largest Polish, largest Catholic, largest Christian cemetery in 
the history of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Jews have no legal or moral right to have the deciding word on the convent.

INTERVENING IN ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something about Ireland that makes politicians, particularly 
Americans, take leave of their senses. Usually the results of these flights of 
fancy are harmless or merely vulgar. Occasionally they are mischievous and, 
potentially, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with the California Legislature's ill-considered passage of a 
bill that would compel the state's public employee and teachers' pension funds 
to ensure that the companies in which they invest conform to the so-called 
MacBride Principles when doing business in Northern Ireland. All that stands 
between this irresponsible and pointless gesture and the statute books is the 
veto we believe Gov. George Deukmejian should exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The measure at issue, AB 2443, was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman John 
Burton of San Francisco. If signed, it would force the two retirement funds to 
report yearly on what the companies in which they invest had done "toward the 
achievement" of the nine points in the MacBride program. 
</P>
<P>
That program takes its name from one of its authors, the late Irish statesman 
and jurist, Sean MacBride, a Nobel Laureate, co-founder of Amnesty 
International and one-time chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Some of 
its principles are inarguably anti-discriminatory, others -- including those 
that seem to demand quotas -- are illegal under British law, while at least one 
-- a requirement that employers be responsible for their workers' security as 
they travel to and from their jobs -- is patently silly. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, none of the 25 U.S. firms operating in North Ireland has 
agreed to sign the MacBride Principles, which are opposed not only by the 
governments of Great Britain and the United States, but also by the Social 
Democratic and Labor Party to which the majority of Ulster's Catholics belong. 
Unlike the promoters of the Burton bill, they understand that the American 
companies, which provide 11% of all Ulster's manufacturing jobs, are regarded 
as the province's leaders in ensuring equal opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
They also know that the burden of living up to the unworkable MacBride 
guidelines could deter the job-creating foreign investment desperately needed 
in Northern Ireland, where unemployment is more than 15%, and Catholic men are 
more than twice as likely as Protestants to be jobless. Perhaps most important, 
they know that the British government already has enacted a strict new 
equal-opportunity law. The new statute was drafted in consultation with the 
SDLP and the Irish government, and its implementation is to be monitored by 
both Dublin and London under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In Ulster itself, the only organized support for the MacBride Principles comes 
from Sinn Fein, the political voice of the murderously anti-democratic IRA. 
That is sort of company in which California will find itself unless Gov. 
Deukmejian vetoes Burton's AB 2443.

A FAN IN HIS OWN RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A. Bartlett Giamatti was a professor of comparative literature, a scholar of 
Renaissance writing and an avid baseball fan. Spectators who are bored by any 
sport that moves slowly enough to see what is happening would say he was a 
connoisseur of the quaint, old and new. For us, it says much that needs to be 
known of both the man and the game, of grace, pressure, courage, pain, 
occasional sheer joy and the irrelevance of stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, a president of Yale University at the age of 40, retired in 1986 and 
started a new career as commissioner of the National League. Last April, he 
became Major League commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball never was simply a matter of grace and courage and it is not now. It 
has had its share of mugs, but it has survived since the White Sox scandal of 
1919 because the first duty of its commissioners has been to keep it as pure as 
humanly possible. An associate described Giamatti as fan-oriented, interested 
in seating and ballpark conditions and anything that would make watching and 
enjoying easier, not harder. 
</P>
<P>
For a lot of us, the hardest part of winter is not snow or mudslides or water 
too cold for surfing but an absence of baseball, so being fan-oriented also 
means keeping the game clean. No matter how hard that was on Pete Rose and 
others whom Giamatti fined or suspended for cutting corners on the rules, 
that's what he was there for. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, a baseball game can go on forever. That has never happened, and 
nobody has a right even to expect even extra innings in real life, but 
Giamatti's death last week at age 51 cut far too short the life of a scholar, a 
baseball fan and, in the most old-fashioned sense, custodian of what baseball 
means to a lot of Americans.

MEDIA'S DIRTY LITTLE PRACTICES SPLIT SEEING FROM BELIEVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL JOSEPHSON and CHRISTOPHER L. TYNER, Michael Josephson and 
Christopher L. Tyner are editor and managing editor of the magazine Ethics: 
Easier Said Than Done, published by the nonprofit Joseph &amp; Edna Josephson 
Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, located in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
A recent TV Guide cover illustration of Oprah Winfrey, looking sensational in a 
seductive, leggy pose on a stack of money, was an eye-catcher. It was also a 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
We all know by now that we were duped, fooled, bamboozled, tricked, deceived. 
The only thing that was Oprah's was her head. The body, the dress, the pose 
were Ann-Margret's -- and almost 10 years old. The incident is by no means 
trivial. It should have responsible journalists and the entire reading public 
steaming mad and genuinely concerned about the media's commitment to truth. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, TV Guide editors, without the permission of either Winfrey or 
Ann-Margret, decided to make the composite to create an "effect." The 
magazine's 15 million readers thought they saw a photo, so realistic was the 
composite. It created a totally false impression of what Winfrey really looked, 
dressed and posed like. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the magazine indicated that the illustration was a composite. The 
hoax was revealed when the designer of Ann-Margret's dress recognized his 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of revelations that ABC News introduced a similarly 
deceptive element into network news coverage -- the photographic re-creation. 
ABC showed its viewers what appeared to be a grainy photo of spy suspect Felix 
Bloch handing something to a KGB agent. Only later was it revealed that the 
"photo" was a fabrication -- a re-enactment, the network said. ABC also said 
later that the airing of the photo was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's news media have responded with surprising calm to these shocking 
instances of journalistic deception. What happened to all that righteous 
indignation we saw when the press learned that White House spokesman Larry 
Speakes had invented quotes for Ronald Reagan? Remember all the sermonizing 
about the importance of truth and credibility? 
</P>
<P>
TV Guide's stunt and ABC's venture into artistic re-creation could be watermark 
events in journalism because they were seen by so many millions of people. This 
kind of blatant fakery should be roundly condemned and clearly disclaimed by 
serious journalists. Every news organization should develop a clear policy and 
communicate it to readers and viewers. 
</P>
<P>
A photograph, because of its capacity to reproduce an exact likeness or image, 
has always held a persuasive power that words lack. Until recently, the 
validity of photographic images has, for the most part, not been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll believe it when I see it," and "seeing is believing," are phrases that 
reflect our inherent confidence in visual evidence. TV Guide and ABC are 
unintentionally contributing to the desensitization of the public's ability to 
be moved by pictures. Our emotional reactions to photos in newspapers and 
magazines run the risk of being dulled if we doubt that the photo is real. 
</P>
<P>
The cost could be immense. What if the shocking pictures and films that made 
their way from the battlefields of Vietnam had been greeted by a skeptical 
public whose confidence had been undermined by knowledge that journalists not 
only can but will manipulate images to make or enhance a point? 
</P>
<P>
What if that photograph of Donna Rice on Gary Hart's lap had raised as many 
questions about the possible "monkey business" of the newspaper as it did about 
the senator? 
</P>
<P>
What about the remarkable picture of the lone Chinese man standing in front of 
a line of tanks outside Tian An Men Square in defiant opposition? What if we 
instinctively wondered whether it was simply the work of an imaginative 
special-effects expert? The Chinese government's denials were made ludicrous by 
pictures sent us by credible journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The instances of fakery by TV Guide and ABC are important because a wide 
audience now knows of its vulnerability to illusion-makers. But insiders know 
of other dirty little practices. 
</P>
<P>
For example, news organizations regularly use an airbrush to erase blemishes 
and unwanted images, not only to make people look better but also to advance 
the paper's agenda. The prestigious Christian Science Monitor has been known to 
delete cigarettes from the hands of photo subjects, even taking the emblematic 
cigar from Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
Where credibility is so important, there are no petty or harmless deceptions, 
no little white lies. 
</P>
<P>
The technology of digital alteration produces undetectable changes with 
lightning speed and seems to beg to be used. It can tempt even the most staid 
organizations. According to a recent Washington Journalism Review article by J. 
D. Lasica, a features editor and columnist for the Sacramento Bee, National 
Geographic editors in 1982 approved the digital moving of one of the Great 
Pyramids closer to another so both would fit on the cover. To its credit, the 
magazine has since adopted a strict policy against such alteration of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Lasica's conclusion is apt and foreboding: "Faster than you can say 'visual 
credibility gap,' the 1980s may be the last decade in which photos could be 
considered evidence of anything." 
</P>
<P>
What a terrible pity that would be.

</P>
<P>
Today, several million whites may vote in the national elections. None of the 
more than 25 million blacks even has the right to vote. Under the Group Areas 
Act, black people are still required to live in so-called "townships," 
remarkable for their squalor and dreariness and for the ease with which they 
can be sealed off militarily. 
</P>
<P>
People who demonstrate against these segregated and inferior conditions are 
gassed and arrested. Black and white leaders who oppose the system and seem to 
be effective are either detained or restricted under so-called emergency 
regulations, which the entirely white courts have declined to review. 
</P>
<P>
If it weren't for international sanctions, the government wouldn't even offer 
the pretense of change. Leaky and ineffective as they are, sanctions aggravate 
the economic decline of the country, under way since the beginning of the 
decade. Blacks know that external sanctions are now their best hope, because 
internally opposition is neutralized by an efficient security apparatus while 
externally the military arm of the African National Congress, always 
overestimated, has been deflected. 
</P>
<P>
The extra-parliamentary opposition, as it is called, presses allies abroad to 
maintain and increase sanctions. The white government is also obsessed with 
sanctions. It seeks to have them lifted by creating the illusion of change. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamics of the Pretoria government militate against real change. A 
characteristic of autocratic states is that officials seek to conserve the 
party, the system, their constituencies and their careers, even though the 
economy and the social infrastructure may be slowly disintegrating. Where even 
the enfranchised cannot dismiss rulers who have failed to perform well, there's 
no incentive to undertake initiatives that might fail. 
</P>
<P>
True, initiatives might reverse the decline, but they will hurt some 
constituents. More to the point, they can fail, which would spell the end of a 
career. Staying on course has no risk. Things will decline further, but 
imperceptibly to those who count. Meanwhile, one's career can flourish. 
</P>
<P>
This is how it works in South Africa. Like bureaucrats in the Brezhnev era, 
Pretoria's officials make the smallest concessions, just enough to get by. 
Words are changed. Apartheid is dead. (But it's not.) Many people are executed. 
(That continues.) The government is ready to negotiate. (But not with the 
enemy.) The voice is now Jacob's, the hands are still Esau's. 
</P>
<P>
They may be unaware of it, but white racists are also victims of their system. 
They were taught to hate in school, in their families and, until four years 
ago, by the church. All their information is controlled. Everything they hear 
and see validates the hatred. In an odd way, the men and women who have taken a 
stand, even if they're detained or restricted, are freer. 
</P>
<P>
In my talks with black people in the townships, I was struck by their 
understanding of the situation and their extraordinary tranquility. It comes, I 
suppose, from a sense of the human dignity of all, from courage and from the 
deep conviction that history will vindicate them. 
</P>
<P>
The saddest people in South Africa are the "in-betweeners," mostly whites, in 
business, the universities and even government, who have some moral 
consciousness and recognize the evil of the system but who accommodate it and 
are rewarded with wealth, comfort and respect. 
</P>
<P>
The in-betweeners are skilled at the double-entry bookkeeping of all moralizers 
and rationalizers. They may pay their domestic servants a wee bit more, protect 
a friend who has trekked to Dakar or Lusaka to meet with the ANC, bemoan the 
government privately and tell themselves they're working from within to change 
the system while they tolerate and benefit from it. They always tell you 
apartheid is dead and things are getting better. They are the damned of South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
So the king is dead. Long live the king. The ruling National Party, the 
government that proclaimed the death of apartheid, is campaigning on a platform 
of "group rights." That means that different groups should have their own 
facilities and the option of living separately, with no group controlling any 
other. In other words, forget "one man one vote" and majority rule. In other 
words, apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Even that change of vocabulary could cost the ruling party the election, for 
the right-wing Conservative Party claims to reject any accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
The election may be about as real as the death of apartheid. Many outsiders, 
myself included, have thought of South Africa as an imperial democracy, like 
Israel or England in the days of its empire. 
</P>
<P>
In imperial democracies, vigorous power-sharing takes place within the ruling 
group. All of those outside that group are powerless. South Africa has 
elections, campaigns and a scattering of parties, but emergency regulations, a 
self-sterilized judiciary, effective censorship and a powerful and widespread 
secret apparatus all conspire to control nonwhites and whites. 
</P>
<P>
The most astonishing thing about this police state is the effect of censorship. 
Television, the major source of information for the man in the street, is 
controlled by the government; so is radio. The press is censored, as are other 
publications and movies. People who are "banned" may not even be mentioned 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a white South African travels abroad or cultivates a taste for the 
foreign press or the British Broadcasting Corp.'s World Service, his values and 
images of the world will be the handiwork of the political elite: a rosy world 
where apartheid is dead and South Africa flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
The government in Pretoria may capture the minds of its people. It must not 
capture ours. Apartheid is not dead.

ANYONE CARE WHAT WORKS?;

<P>
DRUG PLAN HAS PREVENTIVE MEASURES, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR A DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ETHAN A. NADELMANN, Ethan A. Nadelmann is an assistant professor of politics 
and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public 
and International Affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Drug czar William J. Bennett's national drug control strategy, announced 
Tuesday night by President Bush, calls for more money for drug treatment and 
drug prevention. 
</P>
<P>
That's good. It acknowledges that illegal drugs cannot be kept out of the 
country by tougher border control and interdiction measures. It concedes that 
drug eradication efforts overseas can accomplish little in keeping cocaine and 
heroin out of the United States. And it recognizes that pursuing such efforts 
can play into the hands of communist guerrillas and anti-American forces in 
drug-producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett is not the first federal official to acknowledge these limitations. His 
willingness to concede these points -- even if he continues to throw money in 
their direction -- offers some hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett also wants to go after the casual user, particularly of marijuana, 
with an intensity not seen in two decades. This aspect of his plan represents a 
wholesale -- and costly -- rejection of the lessons of drug history. Seventeen 
years ago the Shafer Commission, appointed by President Richard M. Nixon, 
recommended that marijuana be decriminalized. That same year, the Canadian 
government's Le Dain Commission did likewise. Ten years later, a panel 
appointed by the National Academy of Science (the nation's most prestigious 
body of scientists) arrived at the same conclusion. All agreed that 
criminalizing marijuana possession did more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
Between 60 million and 70 million Americans have used marijuana. Not one has 
died from an overdose, a striking contrast not just with alcohol but even with 
aspirin. The Drug Enforcement Administration's administrative law judge, 
Francis Young, after extensive hearings on the medicinal value of marijuana, 
concluded that the drug "is one of the safest therapeutically active substances 
known to man." 
</P>
<P>
In the 11 states that decriminalized marijuana during the 1970s, rates of 
consumption have been indistinguishable from rates in those states that did not 
decriminalize. A 1988 study by Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya in the Journal 
of Psychoactive Drugs estimates that California's decriminalization law, the 
Moscone Act of 1976, has saved the state half a billion dollars in arrest 
costs. In the Netherlands, where cannabis was decriminalized in 1976, 
consumption among young people has actually decreased. 
</P>
<P>
All the evidence suggests that targeting and punishing marijuana users are not 
merely foolish but costly, counterproductive and immoral. Most marijuana users 
are not drug addicts but responsible citizens who work in the legal economy, 
pay taxes and care for their families. Yet they are the ones most likely to 
test positive in a drug test that has nothing to do with their job performance. 
And they remain susceptible to arrest by police who presumably have many more 
valuable things to do. Americans would be better served if Bennett heeded the 
lessons of science and history. No more benefits from a return to the hysteria 
of the "Reefer Madness" era. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett also seems to believe that more police and prisons are the principal 
answers to the drug problems of the inner cities. Here again, he is ignoring 
the lessons of history. During the past decade, expenditures on drug 
enforcement have roughly tripled and the number of Americans in prison has 
doubled. Paying for the construction and maintenance of prison systems now 
represents the fastest growing item in many state budgets. No other country in 
the Western world (except South Africa) has a higher percentage of its citizens 
behind bars. Yet despite this dramatic increase in punitiveness, most aspects 
of the drug problem in the inner cities are getting worse, not better. Bennett 
should consider the possibility that the heavy emphasis on criminal justice 
policies may be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of the inner cities during the 1980s suggests that tougher 
penalties and more police will not deter children from pursuing lucrative 
opportunities in drug dealing. Nor will it deter them from aspiring to emulate 
the wealthy drug dealers who are their heroes today. Getting tough will not 
reduce the turf wars between drug-dealing gangs -- indeed may increase it. More 
police will not persuade pregnant women that their crack use is doing grave 
harm to their babies. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed in the inner cities is a very different two-pronged policy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The government needs to undermine the vitality of the illicit drug market 
and to destroy the distorted incentive structures that lure so many inner city 
boys and girls into the drug world. Decades of trying to accomplish this with 
criminal-justice measures have proven the failure of such approaches. The only 
solution now is a controlled policy of drug legalization. Government must 
regulate and tax. But it must also make even the most dangerous drugs available 
to those adults who want them. There is no other way to drive the organized and 
unorganized dealers from the business. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Much greater resources, derived from taxation of the drugs that are now 
illegal and untaxed and from the billions saved by not wasting money on more 
criminal- justice measures, must be devoted to drug treatment and drug 
prevention. With the growing involvement of drug users in the spread of AIDS, 
it is all the more imperative that as many of them as possible be drawn into 
drug treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is just as important, however, that we plan for the future by investing in 
preventative measures -- not drug education so much as more Head Start programs 
and prenatal and postnatal care. All of the evidence indicates that a dollar 
invested in preventive measures such as these returns a far greater dividend 
than a dollar invested in incarcerating yet another drug dealer or user. Yet 
because they sound liberal and "welfare-ish," they are rejected by a public 
desirous of "tough" measures. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett cannot be blamed entirely for responding to the hysterical cries of a 
public whipped up to its current frenzy by the media and the politicians. But 
he is clearly an intelligent man -- intelligent enough to distinguish between 
what works and what doesn't, and intelligent enough to recognize the costs of 
pursuing popular and symbolic goals at the expense of decent, sensible, humane 
and cost-effective solutions. The United States doesn't need a war against 
drugs, or a war against drug users, or even a drug czar. Rather, it needs a 
courageous leader and teacher, one willing to eschew the rhetorical stance and 
pursue the most sensible policies.

TRACK GROUP STRIPS JOHNSON OF WORLD RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
HIS 100-METER, 60-METER MARKS ERASED BECAUSE HE ADMITTED USING STEROIDS

<P>
Ben Johnson's name will be erased from track's record books because of drugs 
that, officially, were not there. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on a chaotic vote by the sport's ruling body that, officially, 
was not taken. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation agreed Tuesday to strip Johnson 
of his world records in the 100 meters and indoor 60 meters because of his 
confession that he used steroids from 1981 on. 
</P>
<P>
The marks will go to two Americans -- Carl Lewis in the 100, his first 
individual world record, and Lee McRae in the 60. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who lost his Olympic gold medal in the 100 last year after testing 
positive for steroids, also will lose his world indoor and outdoor 
championships from 1987 and various other world, regional and national titles 
and medals, the IAAF said. Final action on those will be taken in several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
No ballot figures were available for the stripping measure, which took 3 1/2 
hours of debate and two mysterious votes to resolve. It was a raucous meeting 
that included charges of racism and ended with the opposition leader, Amadeo 
Francis, stalking out of the hall in anger. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a travesty of justice," Francis, a member of the IAAF's policy making 
council from Puerto Rico, said. 
</P>
<P>
The record changes take effect when the IAAF issues its annual world-records 
list Jan. 1, 1990. But officials and fellow athletes said Johnson had been 
stripped of much more. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, he's lost everything," Edwin Moses, the two-time Olympic hurdles 
champion from the United States, said. "Everyone knows it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if titles and medals also would fall, John Holt, the federation's general 
secretary, said the IAAF Council, its policy board, would "discuss the next 
logical step" at its next meeting this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the IAAF voted to take away world records from any athlete who 
admits under oath or in writing to drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, is the only record-holder in that position, having testified 
at a Canadian government inquiry last June that he starting using drugs in 1981 
and was taking massive doses in 1987, when he set the world records. 
</P>
<P>
Other athletes, including American javelin thrower Dianne Williams and Canadian 
hurdlers Mark McKoy and Anjela Issajenko, also have admitted drug use in sworn 
testimony and face the loss of various titles and medals. 
</P>
<P>
That Canadian hearing was called after Johnson tested positive for steroids at 
the Olympics last summer and was stripped of his gold medal and world-record 
time of 9.79 seconds. He passed doping tests after setting the remaining world 
records of 9.83 second for the 100 at the world championships in Rome in August 
1987 and 6.41 seconds in the 60 at the world indoor championships in 
Indianapolis that February. 
</P>
<P>
When the new lists come out, Carl Lewis of the United States will have the 
100-meter record at 9.92 seconds, while countryman Lee McRae will have the 
60-meter mark at 6.50. 
</P>
<P>
The world-record stripping was part of a far-reaching anti-drug program adopted 
by the IAAF, which also included worldwide out-of-competition doping tests and 
the concept that one country can challenge the drug status of another's 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Those parts passed with no negative debate. Speaker after speaker pledged 
support for ridding track and field of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But taking away records on an athlete's confession was another story. 
</P>
<P>
Arne Ljungqvist, the head of the IAAF's medical committee, said admissions such 
as Johnson's were as good as positive urine samples for finding drug cheats. 
</P>
<P>
"The real solution will be a change of attitude," Ljungqvist said. "If we 
continue and recognize results achieved by confessed drug takers, we can never 
change the attitude. . . . It's a dirty area, a back-yard area, but we must get 
rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, the IAAF president who controlled the meeting with an iron hand, 
said the sport had to adopt the revolutionary rule for its own protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We started this fight and we must keep in the vanguard of people fighting 
against doping," he said. "These are not proposals against anybody but 
proposals to reinforce our fight, to reinforce our image." 
</P>
<P>
At least three dozen delegates took the floor, with a large percentage -- led 
by Johnson's home of Canada and his native Caribbean -- speaking out strongly 
against stripping. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is to use one black individual to show the world we 
mean business," said Vera Bird, from Antiqua. "We know there are others in the 
same situation. How can we have two standards?" 
</P>
<P>
Francis said all in the room were there because of their love of track. "It is 
like motherhood and apple pie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Francis added, "I have a conscience," and said it would be wrong to strip 
Johnson because of the sprinter's statements under oath at the Canadian 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"We may effectively be putting a muzzle on the mouths of athletes who want to 
speak out about what is going on in the training rooms, in the locker rooms and 
on the little islands," he said. The last reference was to Johnson's trips to 
St. Kitts in early 1988, where he got steroid treatment for muscle injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo proposed an amendment decreasing the time that can elapse between drug 
offense and admission from six to three years and called for a vote that the 
IAAF said was on the entire drug package. There was desultory applause and 
Nebiolo declared that the package was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
An IAAF statement said the package had been accepted by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Some delegates were outraged, saying they didn't know a vote was even being 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
"That was democracy -- didn't you see it?" said Cecil Smith, head of the 
Ontario Track and Field Assn. "They must have had a clap-o-meter." 
</P>
<P>
After the break, the arguments continued. Bird called for a formal vote, 
"asking for some respect," but Nebiolo tried to put it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a proposal and the answer was positive," he said. "We were not 
different people then. We were all together." 
</P>
<P>
Finally Britain's Robert Stinson, the federation's honorary treasurer, 
commandeered the microphone and called for three formal votes -- one on all 
drug matters except the record-stripping, one on the statute of limitations and 
one on the record stripping itself. 
</P>
<P>
The first part passed unanimously in the show of hands. The second saw 99 
delegates vote to restore the doping-confession gap to six years. There was no 
final vote on stripping records but Stinson said the outcome by that time had 
been assured. 
</P>
<P>
"If you voted for six-year retroactivity, you voted for the whole thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting moved to other business, Francis stormed off the stage and out 
of the room, waving his hand in disgust in Nebiolo's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been under criticism for a long time, unjustly so, and we have to get 
tough," Francis said. "But I think he could have gotten what he wanted by 
following more normal parliamentary procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Moses said the issue "was dealing with a political position," but one that was 
necessary to take. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't deny that a problem exists," he said. "We have to convince young kids 
they don't have to load up on steroids to win." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was a suspicion that other world record-holders were on drugs at 
the time they set their marks, Moses replied: "Suspect, yes, but you can't 
prove it. And that's the big issue."

FUNDAMENTALLY, DODGER BATS TRIP UP DEFENSE IN LOSS TO ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers have known all season that bad hitting is contagious. Tuesday 
night, they learned just how contagious. 
</P>
<P>
In a defensive blunder inspired by the fear that they might not score another 
run, the Dodgers tried in vain to throw out Craig Biggio, representing the 
tying run, at home plate after an eighth inning single by Glenn Davis. In the 
process, Davis trotted from first to second base. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of pitches later, Davis scored the winning run on Glenn Wilson's 
single, capping a three-run inning and giving the Houston Astros a 3-2 victory 
in front of 11,212. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda wasn't so upset that his team has blown a 
lead in the seventh inning or later for the 10th time this season. He wasn't 
outwardly angry at Alejandro Pena for giving up the winning run, or at the 
Dodger offense for failing to put a runner on base after the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
His gripes were much more fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
"You never let the winning run go to second base," he said. "We made another 
basic mistake." 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have been that basic. Those involved gave it plenty of different 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after Biggio's one-out, run-scoring double off Pena 
pulled the Astros to within 2-1. A strikeout later, Davis lined a ball in front 
of left fielder Lenny Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Before Aug. 23, Harris had not played the outfield since high school. But he 
knew what he was going to do with this throw. He sent it flying home to catch 
the quick Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
"That man is the tying run, I've got to get him," Harris said. "I did my job." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ball was in the air, though, Biggio had rounded third and 
seemed certain to score. At this point, it was the job of third baseman Jeff 
Hamilton to decide if he should cut the ball off and throw to second to stop 
Davis from advancing into scoring position. He decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
The ball bounced to the plate after Biggio slid around catcher Mike Scioscia. 
The run scored while Davis was striding into second base. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key," Lasorda said. "The cutoff man gets the ball, throws it to 
second, we get Davis and the game is tied." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who at times has struggled in the field in his second full season, 
said he wasn't in a position to make the cutoff decision. He said he hoped to 
hear something from catcher Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing too deep, I was too busy trying to get back near the bag for the 
throw, I couldn't see the runner until it was too late," Hamilton said. 
"Sometimes Mike will shout, but I didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia said it is difficult to shout above the noise of a domed stadium, 
which would leave the decision with Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, it's hard to make that call in this place. He can't hear me," 
Scioscia said. "But even if I could yell, I would have told him to let the ball 
come through. I thought we had a chance at making the play. I like playing 
aggressive defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia shrugged and finally offered the obvious, ultimate explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are swinging the bats like we are, you can't play soft," he said. "On 
the road, you can't give a team a tie. You just can't." 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. It all goes back to the hitting which, incidentally, 
further fell apart in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' comeback bid went the way of strikeout, strikeout, strikeout -- 
all against a relief pitcher who was appearing in his first game since going 
out with a sore elbow Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no problems with the elbow," said Larry Andersen, who collected his 
third save. "I had more problems with my legs. I was so jittery. I felt like I 
was trying out for a Little League team." 
</P>
<P>
Only two innings from falling below second place for the first time since June 
6, all the Astros are on firmer ground today. After reading that they were 
finished in the morning papers Tuesday, they ended the night one game closer to 
the National League West-leading San Francisco Giants, tied with San Diego in 
second place at six games behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed a lot of character," Astro Manager Art Howe said. "Everybody is 
counting this team out, saying they can't do it. But there's something inside 
them that won't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Ramon Martinez turned Howe's statements into baloney in the 
first seven innings Tuesday, facing just four batters above the minimum 21, 
holding the Astros to just three singles. He left the game after pinch-hitter 
Eric Anthony's leadoff single in the eighth, and wound up allowing one run on 
five hits. It was his first good outing since Aug. 7, a span that included two 
losses and two no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real shame to have this happen to him; he really looked good," Lasorda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was helped by Mike Marshall's RBI single in the fourth and Billy 
Bean's RBI double in the fifth. But Bean ended that inning being thrown out at 
home plate by right fielder Wilson on a single by Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
And against starter Rick Rhoden and relievers Juan Agosto and Andersen, the 
Dodgers failed to reach base again. The final strikeout victims were the middle 
of the order -- Eddie Murray, Marshall and Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Murray was wronged (according to the replay) on a check-swing. Instead of ball 
four, it was ruled a foul-tip strike three by home plate umpire Harry 
Wendelstedt. After a brief argument with the umpire, both Lasorda and Murray 
quietly returned to the dugout. By then, the Dodgers had already blown another 
one. 
</P>

Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning Tuesday, Jeff Hamilton grounded into a double play for 
just the second time since the All-Star break. His nine double-play grounders 
are not the fewest among regulars on the team, however. Mike Scioscia and 
Alfredo Griffin have grounded into just four double plays each. . . . Houston 
left fielder Kevin Bass left the game in the sixth inning with a stained right 
elbow. The Astros were already playing without second baseman Bill Doran, who 
left Monday's game with a strained lower back.

Given a vote, my pick for the next baseball commissioner would be broadcaster 
Bob Costas. Intelligent, fair and with integrity, Costas is attuned to all 
facets of the business and sport. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure: While a vast majority of football coaches are reticent to let their 
quarterbacks call the plays, the coach at Portland State, Pokey Allen, went so 
far as to let the fans call them. The committee dictated a touchdown during 
Portland's 35-21 victory over Cameron.

Considering Pete Rose's recent activities in the marketplace, how long can it

Mike Tyson was walking along a New York street the other day when he thought to 
himself, what the heck, why not ride? Especially with a snappy red Ferrari 328 
staring out at him from a showroom. The heavyweight champ wrote a check for 
$150,000 and was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Tyson, imagine a Canadian promoter coming up with $2.5 million site 
money for his yawner against inexperienced Razor Ruddock in November. To make 
ends meet, he's hoping to drag $1,500 out of the good people in Edmonton for a 
ringside seat.

When the Washington Capitals took off for a nearly three-week swing through 
Sweden and the Soviet Union as part of training camp Tuesday, they were hauling

A letter to a Gotham sports page states, "While looking at the list of players 
drafted by the over-35 league in Florida, it occurs to me that two teams (Port 
St. Lucie and Winter Haven) could probably run away with this year's American 
League East." Darned if the guy probably isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that after all the commotion surrounding ex-Navy star Napoleon

George Steinbrenner says, "Fans love winning. If we were winning, we could get 
away with playing Adolph Hitler in right field." With no Fuhrer to play right

It's easy to see why some athletes don't bother scrutinizing the papers while 
in the midst of a competition. While wading through David Pate, Derrick

Beleaguered Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson says: "Since I've been here, 
Kirk Gibson was the only quality player that came through our minor-league

The false claim -- what about Howard Johnson, Sparky? -- reminds of Mayo 
Smith's complaint when Detroit fell on tough times after fielding a good team 
in the late '60s and early '70s: "The only guy who has made it onto the club

RIPKEN SETS HOME RUN RECORD AS ORIOLES WIN, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baltimore's Cal Ripken became the first shortstop in baseball history to hit 20 
or more home runs in eight consecutive seasons and then doubled home the 
tiebreaking run in a two-run seventh as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the 
Cleveland Indians, 3-1, Tuesday night at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken's homer was a line drive to left-center that center fielder Brad 
Komminsk caught above the wall before tumbling over the fence at the 387-foot 
sign. Komminsk had the ball as he fell over the seven-foot-high fence, but the 
ball came loose when he landed on a metal tarpaulin holder. 
</P>
<P>
"From my vantage point I was out," Ripken said. "I was happy to get a hit. I 
had no idea it would carry that far. I thought he caught it cleanly, but then I 
saw an umpire signaling home run." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken and Ernie Banks had been the only shortstops to hit 20 or more home runs 
in seven consecutive seasons. Banks hit 20 or more from 1955-61 for the Chicago 
Cubs before being shifted to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken also became the first player to hit 20 or more home runs in each of the 
last eight seasons. Boston's Dwight Evans, Detroit's Fred Lynn, Atlanta's Dale 
Murphy and Tom Brunansky of St. Louis hit 20 or more in each of the last seven 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Bob Milacki (10-12) scattered seven hits in 7 1/3 innings, including 
Cory Snyder's fourth-inning homer. In 20 games at Memorial Stadium, Snyder has 
29 hits in 73 at-bats for a .397 average with nine homers and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
By reaching the seventh inning for the 21st time in 30 starts, Milacki became 
the first rookie to pitch 200 innings this season, reaching 204. Gregg Olson 
picked up his rookie-record 24th save with 1 2/3 scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 13, Boston 1 -- Curt Young allowed one unearned run in five innings, 
and the Athletics routed Roger Clemens and the Red Sox at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The A's wrapped it up with eight runs against four Boston pitchers in the 
eighth inning. The inning included three consecutive walks with the bases 
loaded, pinch-hitter Felix Jose's two-run single and an RBI single by Mark 
McGwire and Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Young (5-9) is 3-1 with a 1.33 ERA over his last five starts and has given up 
only one home run in his last 63 innings after yielding nine in his first 38 
innings. Todd Burns pitched three innings and Dennis Eckersley worked the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's 3 1/2-game lead over Kansas City in the West is the A's biggest of 
the season. The third-place Red Sox fell six games behind Toronto in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (14-10) is 1-6 lifetime against the A's, the only team against which he 
is under .500, and has never won in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 10, Kansas City 2 -- The Tigers won their fifth consecutive game for 
the first time since June 1988, beating the Royals as rookie Kevin Ritz pitched 
seven strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers chased rookie Tom Gordon (16-6) with six runs in the first inning. 
Ritz (4-3) yielded one run and seven hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, last in the East with the worst record in baseball, continued their 
home-field domination over the Royals, winning their 12th straight, including 
five this season. The Royals' previous mark for consecutive road losses in one 
park was 11 in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Texas 4 -- Carmen Castillo hit two home runs as the Twins defeated 
the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Tapani scattered six hits over seven innings in his first major league 
start. Tapani, a 25-year-old right-hander who made three brief relief 
appearances for the New York Mets before they traded him in the Frank Viola 
deal, walked one and struck out three before giving way to Tim Drummond, who 
also came over in the Viola trade. Jeff Reardon pitched the ninth and yielded a 
two-run homer to pinch-hitter Thad Bosley. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Chicago 1 -- Dave Stieb pitched a three-hitter over seven scoreless 
innings and beat the White Sox at Chicago for the 18th time in 22 decisions at 
Toronto as the Blue Jays remained one game ahead of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lee, hitless in his previous 10 at-bats, drove in two runs with a double 
and a single off Steve Rosenberg (4-11). Mookie Wilson had a pair of singles 
and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (15-8) is 10-1 at Comiskey Park, where he has won eight in a row since 
his only loss on May 4, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
New York 12, Seattle 2 -- Deion Sanders, who was supposed to be gearing up for 
the start of the National Football League season this weekend, drove in four 
runs with a pair of doubles and a home run at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, a two-time All-American defensive back at Florida State and the 
Atlanta Falcons' No. 1 draft choice who was recalled last week from Columbus of 
the Class AAA International League, hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning 
and a two-run double in the sixth as the Yankees won their sixth consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees had 17 hits, including home runs by Roberto Kelly and Steve Sax and 
a single, two doubles and three RBIs by Steve Balboni. Meanwhile, Eric Plunk 
(6-4) held Seattle to four hits in seven innings, including Jay Buhner's 
434-foot two-run homer in the fourth.

REDSKINS GAMBLE ON OLKEWICZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HERNDON, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neal Olkewicz has cleared his last hurdle and now seems destined to finish his 
career with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year middle linebacker, who signed with Washington as a free agent out 
of Maryland and beat back several challengers over the last decade, cleared 
waivers Tuesday and will rejoin the team Wednesday when it starts practicing 
for the opener against the New York Giants Monday night. Olkewicz plans to make 
this his last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it as one more obstacle I had to overcome," Olkewicz said. "I try to 
make a positive out of everything. It worked out all right so it wasn't that 
big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Olkewicz spent the last 24 hours wondering whether he could finish his career 
with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little weird," he said as he waited to see if any other team would 
claim him, "but I wasn't on pins and needles." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins, who went two-for-three in roster gambles, won the gamble with 
Olkewicz when he wasn't claimed. They figured that no team would claim him 
because of his age (32) and salary ($350,000). He also didn't get any offers 
when he was left unprotected in February as a Plan B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
They also won their gamble when they put kick returner Joe Howard on waivers 
Monday. Because Howard cleared waivers last month when the Buffalo Bills cut 
him, the Redskins figured he'd clear again. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
But they lost their gamble when they put two defensive linemen, Curtis Maxey 
and Mark Duckens, on waivers and hoped that one of them would clear. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did. Maxey was claimed by the Atlanta Falcons and Duckens by the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
So the Redskins re-signed offensive lineman Ralph Tamm, who was one of the 13 
players waived Monday, and added him to their roster while putting two 
offensive linemen, Ray Brown (knee) and Mark Schlereth (shoulder), and 
linebacker Brian Bonner (back) on the injured reserve list. They'll be out a 
minimum of six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins will open the season with nine offensive linemen and six defensive 
linemen. Usually, they have eight linemen on offense and seven on defense. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in the last year that the Giants have claimed a 
defensive lineman from the Redskins. Late last year, they claimed Robb White. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we're going, we better hire Torgy (Redskins defensive line coach 
LaVern Torgeson)," George Young, the Giants' general manager, said. "He knows 
our players better than we do." 
</P>
<P>
When he was asked if he considered claiming Olkewicz to deprive the Redskins of 
their middle linebacker for the opener against the Giants, Young said, "We 
wouldn't do that. That's not fair to the Redskins or the player." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons claimed Maxey to back up nose tackle Tony Casillas. To make room 
for Maxey, the Falcons cut their 12th-round draft pick, nose tackle Tony 
Bowick. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he claimed Maxey, Ken Herock, the Atlanta director of college 
player personnel, said, "He's a big kid with good size and decent quickness. We 
just felt like he'd give us some decent push up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
When Dean Hamel walked out of camp, Maxey became a starter, but then he 
suffered a twisted ankle. Markus Koch will open the season as a starting 
defensive tackle, although it's likely Koch would have wound up moving inside 
even if Maxey hadn't been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one surprise, it was that running back Willard Reaves wasn't 
claimed by any other team even though he scored six touchdowns in the 
exhibition season. He's now free to sign with any team. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins also signed four players to their developmental squad -- wide 
receiver Carl Harry, offensive lineman Jim Bishop, defensive lineman Lybrant 
Robinson and safety Tim Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins were working the phones trying to fill the other two slots with 
players cut by other teams.

NEW AND USEFUL: MAKING A SPLASH WITH WINE HOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For wine connoisseurs with everything -- including a sense of humor -- consider 
the new Bottle Butler, a plexiglass holder that makes a wine bottle appear to 
be suspended in air. 
</P>
<P>
Billed by its manufacturer, Chelsie Products of Dublin, Calif., as "the perfect 
predinner party spoof" as well as "a dramatic way to display the evening's wine 
selection," Bottle Butler comes in clear acrylic, wood -- oak or ash -- for 
$20; the black acrylic version is $25, shipping and handling included. 
</P>
<P>
Bottle Butler will be distributed and available in selected wine shops, gift 
and department stores Oct. 1. To order the holder before then, contact Chelsie 
Products, 6681 Sierra Lane, Suite E, Dublin, Calif. 94568; (415) 551-8384. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bathtub Rail 
</P>
<P>
Lumex, a New York manufacturer of bathroom safety products, has introduced a 
new one-piece molded safety rail that slips over the side of the tub and 
fastens securely without the need of tools to install it. 
</P>
<P>
Tub Guard Model No. 6963 fits nearly every kind of bathtub, except the 
old-fashioned type with a lip on the top. Because it has a suction pad 
underneath, it also fits over tubs with shower doors that have either 1/4-inch 
or 1/2-inch door railings. You can attach the Tub Guard at the back of the tub 
to assist you in getting in and out. 
</P>
<P>
Tub Guard is simple to install, a Lumex representative said, and because it's 
lightweight -- just 2 1/2 pounds -- you can take it with you on a trip. It has 
a plastic lever that lifts up, so it can be secured over the top of the tub. 
Turn the lever clockwise to open, and once it is placed over the edge of the 
tub, turn it counterclockwise to close, and flip down the lever to lock. 
</P>
<P>
Tub Guard Model No. 6963 comes in white, beige or light blue and retails for 
about $50. It is available nationwide at Lumex dealers, home health-care stores 
and pharmacies. If you're unable to find it in your area, call Lumex's 
toll-free number, (800) 645-5272. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Towel Anchors 
</P>
<P>
Just out from For Shore Enterprises in Los Angeles are Towel Tacks, sturdy 
plastic anchors to keep your picnic tablecloth, beach towel or blanket secured 
to grass or sand. The anchors also come with a drink caddy to hold your soda 
can upright. 
</P>
<P>
Towel Tacks, invented by former Chippendales dancer-singer Chad Austin Powers, 
are 8-inch long stakes with a knob on top. You place a corner of a blanket or 
towel over the nob and then secure it with a locking ring, twisting it a 
quarter turn over the nob to lock into place. A company spokesman said that the 
holders will not damage the cloth. Put the anchors on all four corners of the 
cloth and push the stakes into the ground or sand. The drink caddy also can be 
secured over the stakes in a similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail price for a set of four anchors and rings, plus one bonus 
drink caddy, is $7-$9 at selected Southern California surf shops, drugstores 
and groceries. They come in pink, green, yellow, blue or black or two 
combinations of colors. You can buy additional drink caddies, sold separately 
for $2 each. If you can't find Towel Tacks in your area, they can be ordered at 
$9 a set, including shipping and handling, from For Shore Enterprises, 3718 E.

NEW LIGHT ON ROSENBERG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fatal Error: The Miscarriage of Justice That Sealed the Rosenbergs' Fate, by 
Joseph H. Sharlitt (Charles Scribner's Sons: $24.95, 274 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenberg case, to paraphrase James Joyce's epigram on history, is a 
nightmare from which I am struggling to awaken. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in the electric 
chair at Sing Sing prison for the crime of conspiracy under the Espionage Act 
of 1917. To this day, I am haunted by the poignant images of their last days -- 
the Rosenbergs, side by side, but separated by the wire mesh of a prison van; 
and their young sons, soon to be orphaned, being led away from the prison gate 
by their parents' weeping attorney. 
</P>
<P>
And, to this day, we are still haunted by the same questions that pervaded the 
Rosenberg case from the outset: Were they guilty? And even if so, were they 
fairly tried and duly executed under the law? According Joseph Sharlitt's 
"Fatal Error," the latest addition to the substantial literature of the 
Rosenberg case, the answer to the second question is a passionate and anguished 
"No." 
</P>
<P>
Like Louis Nizer, whose "The Implosion Conspiracy" was a leading work on the 
Rosenberg case for many years, Sharlitt is an attorney who has studied the 
legal record in great depth and with a sophisticated eye. But, unlike Nizer, 
Sharlitt gained access to new and shocking information about the inner workings 
of the Supreme Court in the Rosenberg case; and, unlike Nizer, he concludes 
that justice was not done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disregarded the Law' 
</P>
<P>
After studying the final appeals of the Rosenbergs in the United States Supreme 
Court, Sharlitt is convinced -- and he convinced me -- that the high court 
condemned Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to death in the face of compelling reasons 
to overturn the conviction or at least to stay the execution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court rushed the Rosenbergs to the electric chair in violation of 
their rights before that Court," Sharlitt insists. "The Supreme Court 
disregarded the law, its own traditions, and violated the rules that govern the 
conduct of the justices, in its dash to kill this couple." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the book is a fairly abstruse legal argument that was raised at 
the 11th hour by a couple of freebooting lawyers who intervened on behalf of 
the Rosenbergs. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, they argued that the Rosenbergs had been tried and convicted under 
the wrong law -- the Espionage Act of 1917, which empowered the trial judge 
alone to sentence the Rosenbergs to death, instead of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1946, which would have required a jury recommendation for the imposition of the 
death penalty. If the 1946 act applied to the alleged conduct of the 
Rosenbergs, Sharlitt concludes, "the Rosenbergs were executed illegally." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry, Elegant Treatment 
</P>
<P>
I am deeply impressed by Sharlitt's ability to write plainly and persuasively 
about some of the most obscure twists and turns of the law -- "Fatal Error" is 
a tough, blunt, angry book that never condescends to the lay reader, and never 
sacrifices the elegance or subtlety of the law for sake of a cheap rhetorical 
point. 
</P>
<P>
(Sharlitt is a seasoned international trial lawyer, and I imagine that he's a 
master when it comes to the closing argument before the jury.) 
</P>
<P>
But the real drama in "Fatal Error" is Sharlitt's intimate account of the 
day-by-day, hour-by-hour struggle of the self-appointed defense lawyers to 
bring their new arguments before the justices of the Supreme Court in the last 
week before the execution of the Rosenbergs -- and the heartbreaking antics of 
the Supreme Court justices and other federal judges in their equally frantic 
efforts to toss away a judicial hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
Sharlitt's vivid portrait of the volunteer champions of the Rosenbergs, Fyke 
Farmer of Nashville and Daniel Marshall of Los Angeles, is a healthy reminder 
that at least some lawyers are motivated by the purest idealism and a 
rough-and-ready sense of justice. 
</P>
<P>
And their skirmishes with the Rosenbergs' own lawyers -- who, at first, shared 
the opinion of the federal judiciary that Farmer and Marshall were 
"interlopers" and "intruders" -- only heightens the tragic irony of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sharlitt also reveals how the mean-spirited politics of the high court -- and 
not the sober consideration of legal issues -- sent the Rosenbergs to the 
electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
William O. Douglas, defying a gentleman's agreement among his fellow justices 
to take no further action on the Rosenberg case, unilaterally issued a stay of 
execution to permit a fuller consideration of the new issues. The other 
justices were hastily recalled from their summer recess in order to overrule 
Douglas, and thus to punish him. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a damning comment on the High Court's conduct during that week," storms 
Sharlitt, "that a legal point that had never before been raised, that should 
have spared the lives of the defendants, that was wholly correct even though 
scores of judges and lawyers had missed it entirely, was summarily brushed 
aside by the Supreme Court of the United States because of personal pique of 
judge against judge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on 'Technicalities' 
</P>
<P>
"Fatal Error" is not concerned with the ultimate question of the guilt or 
innocence of the Rosenbergs. Rather, Sharlitt focuses narrowly on the 
procedures by which the Rosenbergs were tried, convicted and executed, and he 
concludes that these proceedings were tainted by legal and ethical 
improprieties -- "a major miscarriage of justice." 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, "Fatal Error" deals with what Dirty Harry might call 
"technicalities" -- and Sharlitt concedes that his book is "the brief that the 
Rosenbergs were never allowed to write." 
</P>
<P>
But these are technicalities that go to the very heart of our system of 
justice, and Sharlitt's advocacy is simply brilliant. He has a genius for 
making the law -- and the Rosenberg case itself -- come alive in novel and 
surprising ways. And, even to the casual reader of the Rosenberg canon, "Fatal 
Error" became indispensable on the first day of publication.

ALICE KAHN: A GOURMET'S DIRGE FOR THE DEADHEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was sitting in Chez Panisse Cafe eating my grilled Hawaiian opah with olive 
tapenade and sauteed leeks when I suddenly realized the joint was jumping with 
Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
If I were to lay a plaque at the exact place where the '80s began, it would be 
at Chez Panisse, the Berkeley restaurant where California cuisine was born. 
Then why was the place filled with these ghosts of the '60s? And how did I know 
the other ladies and gentlemen shlurping down plates of baby lettuce salad and 
goat cheese calzone were Deadheads, devotees of the Grateful Dead rock band? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Dead were in Berkeley for the Greek Theater shows, the 
highest, holiest event in Deadville. Even in a town like Berkeley, renowned for 
its bizarre citizens, an added 8,000 tie-dyed freaks still don't blend in. 
</P>
<P>
I also know that Deadheads come in two varieties: those under 30, who want to 
be born again weird, and those over 30, who want to be Dead again on the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The latter were in Chez Panisse. They had left their tie-dyes in the van, but 
usually there was some little telltale sign of Deadness -- say, one nose ring 
too many. In one case, I spotted a "Jerrycise" shirt beneath a Ralph Lauren 
sport coat -- a T-shirt depicting roly-poly Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia doing 
his exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Finally I just asked. People will usually tell you more than you'd care to know 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you Deadheads?" I asked the threesome seated next to me. They were two men 
and a woman with almost a baby, all wearing striped shirts and tight white 
pants. The woman told me it was a week before her baby was due. You could see 
her "outtie" bellybutton pointing through her pants. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were they Deadheads but they were film makers, and during lunch one of 
the two men got up and started filming the others eating their salad of fresh 
pears with figs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for the Smithsonian," the woman explained. "He's doing something on slow 
food versus fast food." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you Deadheads?" I asked the couple seated on my other side as they 
finished their fresh warm mozzarella with basil leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the woman said. "We got our tickets ahead of time and left Los Angeles 
early Thursday to drive up to the show that night." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they got caught in traffic north of Los Angeles, on the Grapevine. An 
overturned big rig left them stuck in their car for 5 1/2 hours. They missed 
the show. But they were philosophical, if not downright mellow, about the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, what can you do?" she said and cocked her head so her earrings chimed. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do in Los Angeles?" I asked the woman, who had five pierced 
earrings on one ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a physician," she said and chowed down her prosciutto with melon. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, I thought, one of those weird-again older Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
"And what do you do?" I asked her companion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a developer," he said, blowing on his acorn squash soup with creme 
fraiche. 
</P>
<P>
I laughed. I've met Deadhead lawyers and Deadhead professors, but this was my 
first Deadhead developer. "What do you build?" I asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"I build mixed-use commercial/residential urbanscapes. . . ." he began. But she 
interrupted him. 
</P>
<P>
"He builds mini-malls," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not," he retorted, and they began to demellow before my very eyes. I 
thought she was going to bean him with her baguette. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to change the subject. "I'm a writer. I met Jerry once," I bragged, 
thinking that would impress them. "Interviewed him for a magazine. The whole 
thing was set up by Jerry's assistant, and then I hit his car." 
</P>
<P>
"Assistant?" the woman said. "You mean. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he's the one," I answered. "I rear-ended him." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," she said as the mocha custards arrived. "I slept with him." 
</P>
<P>
You can take an upscale Deadhead to a fancy lunch, but you can't out-hip her.

HAIG TO NARRATE COMIC 'ANIMALS' AT LEISURE VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even Alexander M. Haig Jr. is amused by the incongruity of this one. 
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state, a man who helped orchestrate the Vietnam War and 
once described himself as "just an old warrior," will appear at the Leisure 
Village Ocean Hills Music Festival in Oceanside this weekend to narrate 
Saint-Saens' comic "Carnival of the Animals." 
</P>
<P>
When reminded during a telephone interview from his Washington office that 
classical music didn't quite fit his hard-edged resume, Haig let out with a 
barking laugh: "Why, for a man of violence, you mean? Well, I guess you're 
right, it's not the usual thing I do." 
</P>
<P>
Self-irony aside, he is accustomed to a different stage, on a different scale. 
Through much of his career -- as a four-star general and later in the Reagan 
Administration as secretary of state -- Haig has played to a global audience on 
more weighty issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Haig, who now claims to be divorced from politics following his failed 
presidential bid last year, said his festival appearance actually makes some 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
His interest in classical music, especially piano pieces, began when, as a boy, 
he enjoyed listening to both his parents play. His mother was an accomplished 
pianist, as was his father, a musician good enough to give concerts. And Haig 
met his wife, Phyllis, following a piano recital she gave in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say that it's in my blood. With all of that classical music around 
you for so long, you have to develop a keen appreciation and have a natural 
leaning that way." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's his involvement with Leisure Village, an affluent senior citizens 
community in lush North San Diego County. Haig, a member of the board of 
directors since 1983, was asked by Leisure Village's developer, Michael L. 
Tenzer, to distinguish the festival by adding his name to the program. "This 
will be a valuable cultural event but, and we make no bones about it, this has 
a marketing objective as well as a cultural objective," Haig conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he was deliberate in emphasizing the event's quality. Under Henri 
Temianka's direction, the festival will begin Friday in Maurice Abravanel Hall 
with two chamber music ensemble concerts by the California Chamber Virtuosi, 
including three movements from Stravinsky's "Petrushka" and Mendelssohn's Trio 
in D minor, Opus 49. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening, Yehuda Gilad will direct the Strawberry Creek Music Festival 
Orchestra in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito Overture" and Schubert's Third 
Symphony. Earlier in the day, Steven Mayer will give a piano recital of Brahms' 
Sonata in F minor, Mozart's Sonata in F and a selection of Fats Waller songs, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning will begin with a panel discussion on contemporary classical 
music that will include Temianka, violinist Sergiu Schwartz, Mayer and Maurice 
Abravanel. 
</P>
<P>
The final Sunday offering will be "Carnival of the Animals," performed by the 
California Chamber Virtuosi under Temianka's direction. Haig will read Ogden 
Nash's wry verse accompanying this piece comprised of 14 "musical pictures of 
animals" for two pianos, string quintet, flute, clarinet and percussion. Before 
that, Schubert's "Trout" Quintet will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
In such a pristine setting, there would seem no room for controversy. But as 
controversy often found Haig in public life, it has surfaced in Oceanside. The 
Times reported in August that Leisure Village's sprawling golf course and part 
of its lavish clubhouse were financed with a $27-million loan insured by the 
San Diego office of the scandal-torn U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials are concerned because Leisure Village, a private, gated 
community, does not provide benefits for the poor. The loan was approved by HUD 
in 1981, two years before Haig became involved with Leisure Village. 
</P>
<P>
Haig said he was "surprised" by The Times' report and did not know enough about 
the specifics of the case to comment. He was concerned, however, that it might 
cast a shadow on the festival, which he hopes will be judged on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
As for his own performance, Haig conceded, a bit sheepishly, that he wasn't 
quite sure how to prepare. His wife will join him on stage, so he plans to 
rehearse the Nash sketches with her. He admires the piece, both for Nash's 
witty writing and Saint-Saens' music -- the piece has been described as the 
composer's most brilliant parody, teasing Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn and 
Rossini -- but he admitted he's a little at sea. 
</P>
<P>
To keep on course, Haig said he'll try to rely on any actorly skills he's 
gained during more than 20 years in public office. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two models, you know -- those that start in acting and go into 
politics and those that, after a bit of politics, go into acting," he said with 
a laugh. "I won't mention any names, but there's a guy out here in California 
that fits the former pretty well. I fit the latter, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Does this represent a new career direction? Haig said he's too busy running his 
own international marketing firm to consider any more time on stage. "No, no, 
if I get through this one without any problems, I'll be happy. I'm just worried 
that I'll miss a beat." 
</P>
<P>
Any interview with Haig is bound to veer toward politics, an area where he 
quickly becomes expansive. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the derisive tone he took with President Bush during the campaign 
for the Republican presidential nomination, Haig is now a loyalist all the way. 
Describing Bush's first months as even an improvement on Reagan's, Haig said he 
was particularly impressed with the President's handling of the recent European 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, areas for improvement. Haig believes the Administration 
must be more definite in its approach to international terrorism and should not 
dismiss military intervention, even when hostages may be endangered. He feels 
Israel, a country that has taken an aggressive approach to terrorists, is a 
valuable model. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to view terrorism in a new way, that this is an ongoing war between 
law-abiding nations and terrorist nations . . . we have to negotiate, but we 
can't get too hung up on the moralist issue . . . we can't make too many 
compromises." 
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that more money must be given to Poland as it reaches for 
democratic and economic reforms. However, instead of "blindly throwing cash at 
them," Bush should push for U.S.-sponsored programs that aid "debt 
restructuring and the training of managers and the labor force," Haig said. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear Haig gets his blood up while talking about the big picture, but he's 
emphatic when pressed about his re-entering politics. "No, I had my stint in 
office. I did my bit and loved it, but that part is over. In 1992 I see myself 
(campaigning) for Bush, but that's about all I see."

Thursday at noon at Culver City Studio, actress Diane Ladd of ABC's upcoming 
movie about Rock Hudson will turn over a check for $25,000 to the American 
Health Foundation to be used to treat persons with AIDS. Ladd and Hudson became 
friends when they starred in "Embryo" in 1976, and since his death she has 
worked to combat AIDS. The $25,000 represents half of her $50,000 one-week 
salary for "Rock," in which she plays Kay Fitzgerald, Hudson's mother. Thomas 
Ian Griffith plays Hudson in the film. ALEENE MacMINN

KCET Channel 28 has quietly canceled its gala 25th anniversary party at the 
Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 28. A spokesman for Los Angeles' public TV station 
cited the "inability to get the name performers that we needed on that date." A 
public announcement was not made, the spokesman added, because "the show never 
officially went on sale." It was, however, promoted in the September issue of 
KCET Magazine featuring Rita Moreno, Robert Merrill and Big Bird. Tickets 
ranged from $75-$4. "A lot of performers we hoped to get were simply not 
available," the spokesman added. So the station cancelled "rather than invite 
people to a second-class show." ALEENE MacMINN

THE SUBTLE PLEASURES OF 'THE RACHEL PAPERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Highway, the irrepressible hero of the slight, bittersweet romantic 
comedy "The Rachel Papers" (at the Westside Pavilion), is nothing if not 
tenacious. In his pursuit of girls he plans his strategies on his computer, 
which contains not only dating tips and detailed data on the objects of his 
desire but even a list of poems suitable for every occasion. 
</P>
<P>
As the nearly 20-year-old Charlie, British actor Dexter Fletcher is a 
diminutive, unhandsome guy who looks more like a debauched 13, complete with 
circles under his eyes, a cross between Mick Jagger and Oscar Levant in their 
adolescence. But Fletcher's Charlie has personality, wit and energy. He 
persuades us that when he peers into a mirror clad only in boxer shorts, he 
believes himself when he says, "Not bad, I'm telling you." Charlie, however, 
proves to be surprisingly vulnerable beneath the brash surface, especially when 
he zeroes in on the stunning Rachel (Ione Skye), a brunette American beauty 
with porcelain skin and lips that actually might be described as being like 
cherries. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1973 Martin Amis novel and written and directed by Damian Harris 
in his feature debut, "The Rachel Papers" is one of the most durable of screen 
fantasies: the physically unprepossessing guy goes after the breathtakingly 
gorgeous girl. While not especially distinctive, the film is pleasant and 
amusing. It has a brisk, well-turned-out quality that augurs well for Harris, 
the son of Richard Harris. Helping set and maintain the film's smart tone is 
Chaz Jankel and David Storrs' deft, trendy score. 
</P>
<P>
You may find yourself having to take it on faith that Rachel could possibly 
find Charlie attractive. In any event, Fletcher and Skye (well-remembered from 
"Say Anything" and "A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon") are charmingly 
adroit actors. As Rachel, Skye must confirm that age-old male belief that women 
are inevitably mysterious and unpredictable. Where she shines, however, is in 
making this goddess human, something for which Charlie is not at all prepared 
and which is really the heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Setting things in motion for Charlie and Rachel is James Spader as Rachel's 
regular fellow, another American living in London. How wonderfully sly Spader 
is and what pleasure he takes in acting! On the surface, he's quite the 
opposite kind of man he plays in "sex, lies, and videotape," yet Spader finds 
the deviousness in both characters and revels in it. Here he's like every 
superficially polished, obnoxious star fraternity man you ever met, the kind 
whose unshakable confidence is based on the firm conviction he's another Robert 
Redford. Spader's role is small but crucial, and he's a delight. So is Bill 
Paterson as Charlie's shaggy, outrageous, superannuated hippie brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rachel Papers" (rated R for some discreet sex and nudity and some 
four-letter words) is minor but it offers some genuine pleasures.

'CHAMPION' SPOTLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL WITHIN US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Champion Within," airing at 8 tonight on channels 28, 15 and 24, is an 
excellent choice to launch this season's "Infinite Voyage" series. 
</P>
<P>
A slight departure from the science series' usual fare, "Champion" -- a look at 
researchers who are using athletes as living laboratories to better understand 
the human body and make it function more efficiently -- is a well-paced show 
that will hit home with viewers who share the national passion for physical 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to this hourlong documentary than just a narrow focus on 
already exceptional athletes trying to perform better. Writer-producer Richard 
J. Wells has taken "Champion" a step further, showing how the benefits of the 
research can apply to just about everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: the segment on Dr. Peter Cavanagh. A researcher at Penn State, 
Cavanagh initially was concerned simply with improving running shoes. This led 
to efforts to design shoes for patients with severe medical problems. In 
"Champions," Cavanagh is seen working with a diabetic who is endangered by an 
ulcerated foot as a result of losing feeling in her feet. Cavanagh's custom-fit 
tennis shoe will help protect her and restore some of her lost mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Mobility is something that athletes take for granted, but the ability to get 
about can make a major difference in the quality of life of an older person. 
"One of the myths is that as we get older, our ability to respond to exercise 
is reduced," says Dr. Bill Evans of the USDA Nutrition Research Center on Aging 
in Boston. "That's simply not true." Evans' test group of octogenarians showed 
the same increases in muscle size and strength after aggressive training as did 
young people -- a happy proof that it's never too late to start exercising. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the appeal of "Champion" (which also will air Monday on KTTV Channel 
11) is its skill in imparting an understanding of our innate potential. The 
human body is capable of performing remarkable feats -- in everyday life. As 
this show amply demonstrates, we can all exceed our expectations, push the 
limits of our self-imposed boundaries. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DEL MAR, SARATOGA RACE TO NECK-TO-NECK FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a sporting controversy, it may not reach the volume of debate engendered by 
comparisons of Mantle and Mays, or Payton and Brown, or Magic and Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of which track offers the better brand of summer racing -- Del 
Mar or Saratoga -- has been known to occupy many a liquid hour among the 
horse-race set. 
</P>
<P>
Now Andrew Beyer, track writer for the Washington Post, has ventured a 
point-by-point comparison. His verdict: Saratoga, if your only concern is 
animals running counterclockwise around an oval; Del Mar, if your desires are 
somewhat broader. 
</P>
<P>
The track at Saratoga Springs in Upstate New York gets the nod for quality of 
competition and race-track facilities, but Del Mar wins for climate and 
off-track entertainment. Overall ambiance is a photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
Beyer says he enjoys Del Mar's "relaxed, unfrantic atmosphere that contrasts 
with Saratoga's intensity." But he has two gripes with the turf near the surf. 
</P>
<P>
One is the paucity of nearby drinking establishments. He finds Bully's in Del 
Mar "a dark and dreary place." Beyer's second beef is the condition of the Del 
Mar facility, which he rates as "inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
"A track that handles $7 million a day in betting should be able to afford a 
cosmetic coat of paint," he wrote, "an adequate number of television monitors 
in the grandstand and a few other amenities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spring Valley Dream 
</P>
<P>
Political notes: 
</P>
<P>
* A group in Spring Valley is planning an incorporation drive. Its cry: Better 
recreation programs and tighter zoning than under county government rule. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rev. Billy Falling, the fundamentalist minister who tried to block "Death 
of a Salesman" from being read aloud in classrooms, may run for the high school 
board of education in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
* The local chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus has backed Bob 
Trettin against Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
The caucus, which rarely backs a man against a woman candidate, endorsed 
Wolfsheimer four years ago but this year preferred Trettin's ideas on child 
care and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handoffs to Handouts 
</P>
<P>
When he went to court in San Diego, Marlin Oliver Briscoe was a common 
defendant with an uncommon history. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty last month to possession of crack cocaine and was sentenced 
to 120 days in Camp West Fork, the county's honor farm outside Ramona, where he 
will undergo drug rehabilitation. It's standard treatment for first offenders 
who admit guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Briscoe, 43, was disoriented and slurred in speech when arrested near midnight 
in a seedy part of downtown last May. He was unemployed and living in a cheap 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long time since his glory days as a star quarterback for Omaha 
University and then nine seasons with five teams in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
When he was drafted by the Denver Broncos, he received considerable media 
coverage as the only black quarterback in the NFL. Later he shifted to wide 
receiver, including part of a season with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the NFL in 1977, he was an assistant football coach at the 
University of Colorado, a car salesman, a math teacher and construction worker. 
He told a probation officer that he began using crack after his divorce in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Just how far Briscoe had tumbled became apparent when Times staff members began 
comparing notes in the wake of Briscoe's sentencing: No less than nine had been 
hit up for money by Briscoe in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The pitch, delivered in or around the downtown Imperial Bank Building where The 
Times has its office, was often the same: I'm Marlin Briscoe, down on my luck, 
I need money for gas or a car part, I've got to get my daughter back to my 
ex-wife in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the nine came across with money. The highest offering was $20. 
</P>
<P>
Briscoe also asked reporters from other newspapers for money, including one for 
a San Diego paper who was assigned to cover Briscoe the day he appeared in 
court.

HIS LIFEBLOOD IS RESTORED AFTER RARE MALADY HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks ago, John Beutlich of Escondido was the human equivalent of a finely 
tuned sports car badly in need of an oil change. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an extremely rare blood disorder, the man who nearly qualified for 
the American Olympic team in 1978 had suddenly developed blood plasma so 
clotted that every one of his major organs was in danger of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, his lungs very nearly deflated, his heart was inflamed, his 
kidneys were in danger of failing and he became so disoriented because of lack 
of blood to his brain that he couldn't even give his wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 straight days, doctors at Palomar Medical Center performed a procedure 
called a plasma pheresis, in which Beutlich's blood was drained from his body 
and replenished with fresh frozen plasma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Pints of Plasma a Day 
</P>
<P>
That's 10 pints of new blood plasma a day -- or a total of 200 pints -- the 
entire amount of frozen plasma the hospital kept in storage. 
</P>
<P>
"He emptied all the frozen plasma we had on hand," said Dr. Jerry Kolins, 
medical director of the community blood bank of North County. "There wasn't any 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Just one week ago, Beutlich came so close to death that his family was summoned 
from Chicago. On Tuesday, however, in what doctors are calling a miraculous 
recovery, Beutlich was out of the intensive care unit, talking about going home 
in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
The college runner has won the race of his life -- against a deadly disorder 
that once killed everyone who contracted it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to friends and co-workers of the U.S. Customs Service pilot, more 
than 250 new pints of blood plasma have been donated to the hospital in a 
nationwide effort to replenish the drained supply. 
</P>
<P>
How does a healthy, 32-year-old father of two strong school-age boys, a track 
star at Loyola University in Chicago who once nearly qualified to run against 
the Soviets, come so suddenly, so inexplicably, close to death? The answer is 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disease that has baffled the 
medical world since it was first diagnosed in Philadelphia 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Andromeda strain," Kolins said. "We're not sure if it's a virus, 
and we're not sure if it's a bacteria. But one thing is for sure -- as recently 
as 10 years ago, if you got it, you were dead within a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors aren't even sure what causes TTP. The only known cure is the plasma 
pheresis procedure, in which the blood plasma is continually exchanged until 
the patient begins to show signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Beutlich's was the first case of TTP treated at Palomar Hospital, according to 
Peter Hein, the Escondido man's personal physician. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very rare," he said. "It's not even known what triggers it, which 
makes a cure doubly hard to come by. Most hematologists go through their entire 
careers and never see a case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Known Sufferers 
</P>
<P>
For humans, the chances of contracting TTP are 1 in 250,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a city of 3 million, for example, it might happen to 12 people over their 
entire lifetimes. In a city the size of Los Angeles, you might not see one case 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
A recent 10-year study on TTP conducted by the University of Pennsylvania 
contained only 40 known sufferers of the disorder, Kolins said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what happened with John," he said. "One theory is that he was 
subjected to some kind of bacterial infection one week before the disease began 
to take effect." 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria can be killed by antibiotics, but not before toxins begin to do 
their damage, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some evidence that the bacteria might produce a poison that causes the 
platelets to clump together and block the circulation of blood," Kolins said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Really Scary' 
</P>
<P>
The clots occur throughout the body, affecting the brain, kidneys, heart and 
lungs, vital organs that cannot be deprived for long of adequate blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really scary," Kolins said. "It's a mystery to think how a healthy, 
32-year-old airplane pilot in the best of health could almost die just like 
that without us being able to do a thing to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
For Beutlich, the nightmare began with a shopping trip to Tijuana with his wife 
and father-in-law. After a day of browsing along the Avenida Revolucion, the 
group ate dinner at a restaurant there. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Beutlich developed cramps at work one day and his wife, Susan, 
saw blood in his stool. He was admitted to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors treated him with antibiotics and he was released a few days later. But, 
after she got her husband home, Susan Beutlich knew something was terribly 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him how he was feeling, and his response was, 'How much does a cup of 
chicken broth cost?' " she recalled. "He thought he was still in the hospital. 
He had no idea who I was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50-50 Chance at Best 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Beutlich's blood platelet level had dropped to 18,000 per cubic 
microliter of blood. Normal human levels are more than 150,000 platelets per 
cubic microliter, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Beutlich's chances of living were at best 50-50, Susan recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to go home," she said. "But I was afraid I'd never see him 
again." 
</P>
<P>
That's when doctors surmised that Beutlich may have been suffering from TTP and 
prescribed the only known cure -- plasma pheresis -- in which his body was 
continually injected with frozen plasma. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the procedure I felt chilled, like I was outside on a 20-degree 
day without a jacket on," Beutlich said. "I was so chilled no amount of 
blankets could warm me up." 
</P>
<P>
Beutlich came closest to death last Sunday when his lungs began filling with 
fluid. The harder he tried to breath, the worse it got. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Passed Out Myself' 
</P>
<P>
"I could see by his chest that his heart was pounding," Susan recalled. "He was 
trying to tell me something, but his eyes were rolling into the back of his 
head. I was so excited, I passed out myself." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Beutlichs have no idea what caused the disorder, they have all but 
ruled out their Mexico excursion as a factor. "All three of us ate the same 
meal in that restaurant," Susan said. "It had to be something else." 
</P>
<P>
The only bright side of contracting TTP, doctors say, is that recurrences are 
almost nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
And, thanks to the donations of concerned friends and colleagues nationwide, 
the hospital's plasma bank has been fully restored for the next TTP crisis. 
Palomar Hospital received plasma donations from customs and law enforcement 
donors from the Los Angeles area, as well as Atlanta and Washington. Several 
North Island military men donated help to Beutlich, a Navy reserve pilot, as 
did several Coast Guard members in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Beutlich himself received emotional support from his two sons, ages 5 and 8. On 
the wall of his hospital room hangs a poster that reads, "Please Get Well, 
Daddy -- Jonathan and Jeremy." 
</P>
<P>
Although Beutlich was the recipient of a huge amount of donated blood, doctors 
say he has little chance of contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not impossible, although every pint of blood was tested and found to be 
negative," Kolins said. "If this would have happened in 1985, I would have been 
mighty worried." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, 1 in 3,000 people who donated blood tested positive for the HIV 
virus, he said. "Then his chances would have been 1 in 15 or 20 of getting the 
disease," Kolins said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's one in several thousands. And, since the alternative was almost 
certain death, this was well worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Although he will soon go home and back to work, the athlete who was almost an 
Olympic 400-meter hurdler still worries about his future in the shadow of a 
killer blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me," he said. "I think it was a blessing in disguise that I was 
mentally out of it most of the time so I never knew how bad off I was. I just 
wish I knew what triggered it, so I could avoid that thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, I got two choices: I can either avoid everything or 
carry on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
He gave his wife's hand a squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
"That choice is pretty easy."

SCHOOLS USE VARIETY OF ANTI-DRUG TACTICS; 
</P>
<P>
S.D. EDUCATORS PRAISE BUSH SPEECH BUT STRESS NEED FOR BROAD APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A panoply of drug prevention programs are in place throughout San Diego County 
schools, and educators believe they are gradually having a cumulative effect in 
cutting student acceptance of drug and alcohol use, particularly at the 
elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators welcomed the emphasis that President Bush placed on the 
anti-drug effort Tuesday night, but stressed that their experiences show 
success depends on a variety of educational approaches and not a single 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The best "bang for the buck" comes at the elementary level, and you can never 
start too soon, Carol Pugmire, assistant superintendent for the San Diego 
County Office of Education, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county office, which offers assistance in curriculum and health for many of 
the county's 43 school districts, wants to customize its offerings this year 
and help more districts strengthen their elementary programs. It will offer to 
examine existing programs in all districts this fall and draw up stronger 
prevention plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Goal for Schools 
</P>
<P>
"I think every school in the county does something," Pugmire said. "But many 
are programs at the junior and high school levels that are taught more as 
deterrence and intervention. At the elementary level, you can integrate the 
material into the kids' feelings about themselves and about self-esteem to get 
them to say no later." 
</P>
<P>
Pugmire said the goal, both countywide and at the state level, is to show 
students that drug education is central to overall physical and mental health 
-- including nutrition, sexual activity and general habits -- as part of the 
"Healthy Kids, Healthy California" initiative of the state Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school programs represent the main thrust of those offered by the 
San Diego Unified School District, the nation's eighth largest with 118,000 of 
the county's 382,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to regular units on substance abuse at each elementary grade, the 
district now offers, in cooperation with the San Diego Police Department, a 
special program for all fifth- and sixth-graders. The DARE program (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education) has been hailed for its ability to show kids the link 
between drug use and self-esteem and peer pressure in Los Angeles-area schools, 
where it originated. 
</P>
<P>
"There never is going to be one single program you can utilize and call it a 
panacea, but the DARE has been a tremendous asset and, in a recent (outside) 
evaluation of all of our pro 
</P>
<P>
grams, it has been ranked right at the top," said Earl Krepelin Jr., the San 
Diego districts's coordinator of Social Concerns programs. 
</P>
<P>
The DARE program also operates in the San Ysidro and Poway school districts 
because much of those districts are covered by San Diego police units. 
</P>
<P>
With a budget of more than $1.5 million planned for the upcoming school year, 
San Diego also has set up Just Say No clubs at 56 elementary schools to offer 
students positive peer groupings, expanded a separate drug awareness program at 
schools in areas with significant gang activity and drawn up plans to expand a 
joint family-counseling program with San Diego State University graduate 
students in social work. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of all of these programs is directly related to the coordination 
of agencies in the community," Krepelin said, adding that many hospitals and 
drug-intervention agencies offer classroom presentations that schools now 
eagerly seek for their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Information Point 
</P>
<P>
"Schools are increasingly becoming the central information point, if you will, 
for these efforts, and not just for students but for the parents as well," 
Krepelin said. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego lags in secondary drug education, Tom Payzant, district 
superintendent, admitted Tuesday. There are now no required drug education 
programs after the eighth grade. Prodded by the Board of Education, in 
particular by member Ann Armstrong, a committee of district administrators is 
designing a required high school course. 
</P>
<P>
"We need (a course) but I believe that a high school-level course should not be 
just on drugs but deal with the whole range of decision-making, of self-esteem, 
of choices that these young people are confronting," Payzant said. Another 
sticky issue is where to place such a course, since teachers of math or English 
or history are loathe to sacrifice their time for additional social-concern 
education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Krepelin said that, despite the lack of required formal anti-drug courses, 
students at many high schools now sponsor anti-drug rallies through their 
student body organizations, at dances and through campus newspapers.

PRICE OF SUCCESS;

<P>
BALBOA PARK MUSEUMS TO RESTRICT ACCESS ON FREE TUESDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobbed by thousands of San Diegans and visitors taking advantage of 
once-a-month free admission, Balboa Park museums next month will begin asking 
visitors to line up for a chance to view the exhibits on the first Tuesday of 
the month, a park official said. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at some park museums rises twenty-fold on free Tuesdays, creating a 
fire hazard and ruining the experience for many visitors, said Chris Fontana, 
vice chairwoman of the Central Balboa Park Assn. The association has asked the 
museums to enforce waiting lines in order to limit the visitors allowed in at 
any one time. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical summer weekday, 3,188 people pay admission to the five Balboa Park 
museums surveyed by her association, Fontana said. But the numbers soar to 
24,958 when admission is waived on the first Tuesday of the month, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, visitors lined up three-deep in front of the Natural History Museum 
exhibits on the free day. "Horrendous is a good word to describe that," said 
Hal Mahan, the museum's director. 
</P>
<P>
From that August high of more than 13,000 visitors, attendance declined to 
5,000 Tuesday, Mahan said. But the record came in the summer of 1988, when 
20,000 people walked through the two-level exhibition area in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
"You put 20,000 people in the space that we have, and it becomes difficult to 
move around," Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
If a museum needed to be evacuated on a free Tuesday, "we would have had 
pandemonium," Fontana said. "I went to the Museum of Natural History last month 
and couldn't get through the door. . . . It was wall-to-wall people." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about public safety forced the change in the open-door policy, museum 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next month, museums will begin enforcing limits set by the San Diego 
Fire Department on the number of visitors allowed in at one time, Fontana said. 
And, although that may force some to wait in lines, it will allow visitors a 
better look at the exhibits once inside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools and camps, unaware that admission to their groups is free anytime at 
most of the museums, have contributed to the problem, Fontana said. "On the 
free Tuesday in August we had busloads of day-camp kids coming in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other frequent free Tuesday visitors are large families priced out of the park 
museums, officials said. "By the time you take your kids to several museums, 
you have spent $100, if you count the food," Fontana said. "So many of them 
come on the free Tuesdays."

LAW ENFORCERS APPLAUD BUSH SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local law enforcement officials Tuesday applauded President Bush's drug 
strategy, calling it "tough" and "balanced," and expressed optimism that San 
Diego will get its fair share of federal dollars to stem the flow of drugs 
coming across the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, whose street forces patrol a border area 
in San Ysidro and other older residential areas where crack cocaine and other 
illicit drugs have proliferated, said he is particularly pleased with Bush's 
call for stricter enforcement of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
"He touched on four important areas, and his first was a need to enforce the 
law. I was pleased with his tough stance on enforcing the law. I was also 
pleased with his stance on zero tolerance for casual drug users. These two 
areas are crucial for local law enforcement officers," said Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. William Braniff, the top federal law enforcement official in San 
Diego and Imperial counties, said he was pleased with Bush's plan to prosecute 
drug users, not just dealers. Braniff lauded the President's drug strategy as a 
"balanced plan to attack drugs at all levels," and, like Burgreen, supported 
Bush's call for zero tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Zero tolerance, a tough and uncompromising plan to deal with casual drug users 
and dealers alike, was pioneered by Braniff's predecessor, Peter K. Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant part of the program dealt with user accountability. . . . I 
believe that users are the ultimate source of the problem and must be the 
ultimate solution of the problem," said Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Interdiction 
</P>
<P>
But still unclear is how local law enforcement agencies will benefit from 
Bush's proposal to give local law enforcement across the nation $350 million to 
combat drugs at the street level. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we get our fair share," Burgreen said. "I don't see any way that this 
area of the country can be ignored, with our problems at the border and the 
growing drug menace in our neighborhoods. . . . I was also pleased with the 
President's comment on the need for interdiction. I would hope that would 
include doing something to make our borders secure." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Mayor Maureen O'Connor declared a "state of emergency" in San Diego and 
asked Gov. George Deukmejian for $34 million to fight street crime, most of 
which was blamed on street gangs and drugs. Deukmejian brushed aside O'Connor's 
request, but the two are scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the 
city's crime and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, O'Connor said she hopes Washington will target San Diego as a "key 
city with unique circumstances" and make available enough money to make a 
difference in the city's war against drugs. Under this approach, the federal 
government "would concentrate added resources" in San Diego, she said. 
</P>

Bush said his plan to make $350 million available to local law enforcement 
officials to battle drugs represents more than a 100% increase in the funds now 
available. According to O'Connor, San Diego received only $1 million in federal 
funds for law enforcement last year. 
</P>
<P>
"What I heard tonight, if I take it as a literal interpretation, that would 
mean we would only be getting $2 million. I hope that's not the case. . . . I 
would hope they (Washington) would have the same sense of urgency for San Diego 
that they have for other cities and Bogota, Colombia. People are also being 
killed here. . . . We also have a major drug problem," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Jail Funds 
</P>
<P>
Both O'Connor and Burgreen said they will push to get some of the $1.6 billion 
that Bush earmarked for new jails. The mayor and chief said that San Diego 
County has the most crowded jail system in the country and hope that Washington 
will take notice of this and make money available to build a new jail. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff credited "the public attitude" for Bush's new push in the drug war. 
Although, Braniff said, Bush failed when, as vice president, he was put in 
charge of the Reagan Administration's war against drugs in 1982, the new fight 
will succeed because the President appears to have public support this time. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important ingredient is the public attitude that something has to be 
done this time. The public realizes that drugs are a problem that spares no 
one. We're all at risk," said Braniff.

The Times reported incorrectly Wednesday that U.S. Atty. William Braniff said 
President Bush had failed when Bush, as vice president, was put in charge of 
the Reagan Administration's war against drugs in 1982. That evaluation of 
Bush's performance should have been attributed to critics of the Reagan 
anti-drug strategy. Braniff supports the Administration's drug program.

WOMAN CROSSING I-5 STRUCK, KILLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Mexican woman was killed early Tuesday when she was struck by a pickup truck 
as she attempted to cross the southbound lanes of Interstate 5, about 10 miles 
north of Oceanside, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Aguilar Torres, 36, died at the scene from multiple injuries, said deputy 
coroner Max Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was apparently trying to follow her two children across a stretch of the 
busy freeway, about 3 1/2 miles north of Las Pulgas Road, when she was hit at 
5:30 a.m. by a pickup driven by Kenneth Freistat, 50, of Long Beach, CHP 
officer Jerry Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bohrer said he didn't know the ages of the children or whether Torres was an 
illegal alien.

LARGE AIRLINE TO OFFER FLIGHTS IN 1990 FROM PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America West Airlines, the nation's 10th largest air carrier, will begin 
passenger flights from Palmdale Air Terminal early next year, giving Antelope 
Valley-area residents renewed access to nationwide air service, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Phoenix-based carrier, which is targeting an early January 
start-up for its flights, means that the Antelope Valley will have passenger 
air service for the first time since another carrier ceased service in 1985, 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The flights will connect Palmdale with Las Vegas, one of America West's two hub 
cities (the other hub is Phoenix). From Las Vegas, the airline flies to about 
50 cities in the United States and western Canada, including New York, Chicago 
and the Baltimore-Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Dicino, a spokeswoman for the 6-year-old airline, said the number of 
daily flights, ticket prices and schedules may not be announced for a month or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, airline officials said they were studying four daily flights 
out of Palmdale to Las Vegas using 37-seat de Havilland Dash 8 turboprop 
planes. Dicino said the starting date for service depends partly on how soon 
the airline obtains two new planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely committed to serving Palmdale," she said, adding that 
airline officials believe that the fast-growing area "has a tremendous growth 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
The airline will operate out of the now-unused Palmdale Air Terminal. The 
9,000-square-foot facility was opened by the Los Angeles Department of Airports 
in 1971 and used for limited commercial flights over the years. But airport 
officials said it has been vacant since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Moore, executive director of the airports department, predicted that 
Palmdale service will be successful because it will offer northern Los Angeles 
County residents a closer alternative than Los Angeles International Airport.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR SETS ATTENDANCE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's Antelope Valley Fair and Alfalfa Festival in Lancaster set a record 
for paid attendance and had no serious crime or injury incidents, fair 
organizers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 51st annual festival, the top public gathering of the year in the Antelope 
Valley, drew 188,212 paid visitors for concerts, contests, a carnival and other 
activities during its Aug. 25 through Labor Day run, fair officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is 13.3% higher than last year's paid attendance of 166,092, the 
previous high, said fair spokeswoman Sheila Burnette. 
</P>
<P>
Total attendance this year was 313,222, including those who received 
complimentary passes and others. 
</P>
<P>
Only minor law enforcement problems surfaced during this year's celebration at 
the fairgrounds. Burnette said the most serious incident was a fight between 
two teen-age girls that left one with a cut across her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Fair organizers attributed the relative calm to the daily force of about 100 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and security guards who patrolled the 
fairgrounds and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fair's five nights of concerts, visitors showed their preference for 
country music but still failed to fill the arena's nearly 9,500 seats. The Oak 
Ridge Boys drew the largest crowd, with 6,658 tickets sold, followed by pop 
performer Kenny Loggins with 5,639 tickets sold. 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials said it will probably take until later this month to determine 
whether this year's event made money.

DENIAL OF INTERIM HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT LIMITS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles planning official has recommended disapproval of an emergency 
measure that would restrict development on Sunland-Tujunga hillsides until the 
community district plan is rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Planning Commission, Hearing Officer Charles Rausch wrote 
that the interim control ordinance is not necessary because only three 
subdivision applications had been filed in the last 18 months for hillside 
areas. Rausch also noted that no new applications have been filed since two 
public hearings were held on the matter in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "there are adequate remedies in the current Municipal Code and in 
the community plans to regulate subdivision design," Rausch wrote in his 
report, which was issued last week. Rausch was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Arline De Sanctis, chief deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, the ordinance's 
sponsor, said existing measures do not go far enough in controlling growth in 
an area that is increasingly popular with developers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few areas in Los Angeles that has a wide expanse of 
undeveloped territory," De Sanctis said. "The councilman's chief concern is to 
limit the amount of new development in the hillsides of Sunland-Tujunga, to 
keep them from looking like Burbank and Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
De Sanctis said the proposed ordinance would limit hillside development on 
slopes with a 15% grade or more. She said the measure is needed to adequately 
control growth in the Sunland-Tujunga area until the community district plan is 
rewritten, a process that could take from six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gross, director of the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents, said she is 
disappointed with the examiner's report and plans to write a letter to each of 
the five members of the Planning Commission in protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this stinks," Gross said. "Mr. Rausch doesn't acknowledge the fact 
that over 5,000 residents signed a petition supporting" the proposed ordinance. 
Gross has maintained that increased density on the hillsides could result in 
flooding and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission will consider the examiner's report at a public hearing 
Sept. 14. The commission will submit recommendations to the City Council, which 
will make the final decision.

WOMAN DIES WHILE IN CUSTODY FOR MENTAL EVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima woman who struggled with police while being taken into custody for a 
mental evaluation collapsed at the Van Nuys Jail and died at a hospital, Los 
Angeles police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the 25-year-old woman was not released pending notification of 
relatives. An autopsy had not been performed, and the cause of death was 
unknown, Detective Ron Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were forced to subdue the woman when they were summoned to the 12700 
block of Mercer Street in Pacoima at 2:30 p.m. Monday, Karlson said. Officers 
were called by paramedics who had initially been notified by a resident who 
reported that a woman who was acting bizarre had fallen on the street, Karlson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four officers restrained the woman and handcuffed her so she could be taken 
into custody for a mental evaluation, Karlson said. He said the woman was not 
struck while being subdued. It was not known if she was under the influence of 
drugs, Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was taken by ambulance to Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for a 
psychiatric evaluation. But before she was admitted, police determined that she 
had several outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrants and took her to Van Nuys 
Jail. Karlson would not reveal why the warrants were issued. 
</P>
<P>
While being booked at the jail, the woman collapsed and stopped breathing, 
Karlson said. The jail doctor tried to revive her and paramedics took her to 
Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, where she was pronounced dead 
shortly before 4:30 p.m., Karlson said.

St. Louis Cardinal relief pitcher Todd Worrell will be examined today by Dr. 
Frank Jobe and may require surgery to repair an injured elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Worrell, 3-5 with a 2.96 earned-run average, would probably miss the remainder 
of the season if he sustained a torn ligament, team spokesman Kip Ingle said. 
If there is only muscular damage, the right-hander would be placed on a 
rehabilitation program and could return in a few weeks, Ingle said.

DRUG USE SEEN HIGHER AMONG LATCHKEY YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latchkey children, whether from rich or poor families, are twice as likely to 
use cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana as those youngsters who are cared for by 
adults after school, according to a new USC study financed by the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The study published today in the journal Pediatrics, is the largest to focus on 
adolescents who care for themselves after school, according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a survey of 5,000 eighth-graders in Los Angeles and San Diego, the 
study found that those children who do not have adults to look after them for 
at least one hour per school day -- America's so-called latchkey children -- 
are at greater risk for substance abuse regardless of their sex, race, family 
income, academic performance, involvement in sports or other extracurricular 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed we would see some differences . . . for example, that the children 
of single-parent homes would be more likely than those in stable, two-parent 
families to be at risk for substance abuse. . . . But that does not seem to be 
the case," said Jean L. Richardson, the study's principal investigator and an 
assistant professor of preventive medicine at the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters in all economic and social strata were at greater risk for drug, 
alcohol and cigarette use if they spent time on their own. And the longer they 
spent alone, the greater their risk, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Those children who spent 5 to 10 hours a week in "self care" were 1.7 times as 
likely as cared-for youngsters to use alcohol, 1.6 times as likely to smoke 
cigarettes and 1.5 times as likely to use marijuana. Those who spent 11 or more 
hours a week alone were twice as likely to use alcohol, 2.1 times as likely to 
smoke cigarettes and 1.7 times as likely to use marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Anglos Than Latinos 
</P>
<P>
The children who were left alone regularly were more likely to be Anglo, rather 
than Latino, probably because there tend to be more extended-family 
relationships among Latino groups. Surprisingly, the study found that children 
who were not being cared for by an adult were more likely to live in 
high-income areas than in low-income ones. 
</P>
<P>
There are "clearly important public policy issues" raised by this study, 
Richardson said in an interview Tuesday. But, she added, the findings should in 
no way be construed to make mothers or fathers feel guilty that they are 
working, or that they should now stay home with their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's . . . realistic," she said. "Women are working. Men are 
working. Both groups are going to continue to do so. I hope there is not a 
backlash as a result of this study. The appropriate question is how do you deal 
with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties in knowing how to solve the potential problems of 
latchkey children is that the research does not make it clear precisely why 
adolescents who are not supervised are more susceptible to drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Friends 
</P>
<P>
Some of the youngsters who participated in the study said they had friends who 
smoked or drank and who presumably influenced them. But others said their 
exposure to alcohol and cigarettes was the result of solitary experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires filled out by eighth-grade 
students in public schools in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San 
Diego. Parents were also surveyed to validate children's responses to questions 
about what arrangements, if any, had been made for the youngsters' care. 
</P>
<P>
There is no data to determine precisely the number of children who regularly 
care for themselves. But certainly the number of working mothers has grown 
dramatically -- from less than 40% in 1970 to more than 60% in 1985. The 
divorce rate also has risen among certain groups. 
</P>
<P>
With two out of three recent first marriages now ending in divorce, the 
likelihood that children will be left alone frequently continues to rise, 
experts say. Among all latchkey children, however, children of single parents 
are not necessarily more likely to use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home to Empty Houses 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, more than 40% of children under the age of 13, somewhere 
between 2 million and 6 million youngsters, go home to an empty house after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"These estimates may be low because parents may be reluctant to admit that 
their children have no adult supervision," Richardson wrote in the article. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have long recoiled from the idea of leaving children -- even those 
who were on the verge of adulthood -- unattended. During the Depression, the 
term "latchkey" children was widely used to describe the many unfortunate young 
souls who went home alone, wearing house keys around the necks. In the 1950s, 
Dr. Benjamin Spock counseled mothers to consult a social worker before taking a 
job, because of the possible dire consequences for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Whether such worries were justified is still not clear. The few studies of 
children who care for themselves have reached different conclusions concerning 
the risks and benefits involved. While one study found that children who care 
for themselves after school are more fearful and depressed, other studies have 
found no difference in measures of self-esteem or in academic performance of 
those who go home to mother or to an empty house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effective Parenting 
</P>
<P>
Parenting styles, rather than the presence or absence of an adult, may have as 
much influence on the behavior of children as has anything else, according to 
another study. That study, done by researchers at the University of Wisconsin, 
found that parents are more effective when they require children to perform 
specific chores after school, require the child to check in by telephone upon 
arriving home and set specific limits on where the child can and cannot go 
after school.

Police using whips and dogs broke up a protest march Tuesday in the sleepy 
white college town of Stellenbosch, and hundreds of thousands of voteless 
blacks nationwide began a two-day strike on the eve of elections that will be 
the most severe test of white support for the government since it came to power 
41 years ago.

South African whites will cast ballots today in parliamentary elections that

Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party is favored to extend its

Could Lose Quarter of Seats 
</P>
<P>
The National Party's own leaders predict that it could lose up to a fourth of 
its seats to the right-wing Conservative Party and the liberal Democratic 
Party. Such a swing would affect De Klerk's pledge to lead the country away 
from the "distrust, suspicion and fear" that grip white and black South 
Africans. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the elections is the pace of reform in South Africa, where 26 
million blacks are ruled by 5 million whites under the system of racial 
segregation called apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Many blacks consider the elections meaningless, and the call for workers and 
students to stay away capped a campaign of civil disobedience that has touched 
off dozens of bloody confrontations with the police, 1,600 arrests and, the 
government says, 70 unrest-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Any political activity that ignores black people is doomed," said Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been 
arrested twice in the past week. "The driving force of change in this country 
lies among the disenfranchised, not in Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police dispersed more than 500 white students and black workers who 
marched from the University of Stellenbosch, the alma mater of most of South 
Africa's white leaders, to the center of that town in the lush wine country 
near Cape Town. Demonstrators ran screaming through the streets when the police 
unleashed dogs. Some protesters were beaten with whips, and dozens were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In Pietermaritzburg, 450 college students and faculty members were arrested in 
a similar march, organized to present a petition calling for an end to police 
violence against peaceful protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predict Spread of Strike 
</P>
<P>
Black union leaders predicted that the worker strike would spread today, and 
most black, mixed-race and Indian students across the country were boycotting 
classes as well. 
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to De Klerk on Tuesday, the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose 
affiliation of most anti-apartheid groups in the country, said the elections 
"still symbolize apartheid and the perpetuation of white minority rule. We 
therefore demand that our right to peaceful protest be respected. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Mass Democratic Movement began the defiance campaign Aug. 2, when 270 
ailing blacks sought treatment at whites-only hospitals. Since then, it has 
targeted whites-only beaches and schools as well as state-of-emergency laws 
that prohibit most anti-government activity from meetings to marches. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings in churches were generally allowed by the government until Monday, 
when riot police blocked the doors of two churches in downtown Cape Town and 
arrested a dozen leading clerics, including Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, the 
mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. They were 
released after a few hours in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tutu Reconsecrates Cathedral 
</P>
<P>
Tutu reconsecrated his cathedral Tuesday, telling parishioners that the police, 
in "a scandalous breach of religious liberty . . . sank to new depths when they 
desecrated my cathedral." 
</P>
<P>
The government has attempted to justify its crackdown by contending that the 
defiance campaign is orchestrated by the outlawed African National Congress to 
violently disrupt the elections. However, defiance leaders say they are using 
nonviolent protests to highlight the plight of the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Although the escalating unrest has sullied South Africa's image overseas, many 
political analysts believe it may actually help the National Party in the 
elections by driving whites fearful of a black revolution away from the more 
liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
However, it may also slightly boost the far-right Conservative Party, which 
says the unrest is an example of the trouble the government can expect if it 
makes good on promises to dismantle apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controls 123 of 166 Seats 
</P>
<P>
The National Party now controls 123 of the 166 seats at stake in the white 
chamber of Parliament, while the Conservatives have 22 seats and the Democrats 
20. National Party leaders concede that they may lose 20 to 30 seats, reducing 
their majority from the current 74% to as low as 56%. 
</P>
<P>
Government opponents have predicted an even greater swing of seats, which would 
create a "hung Parliament" in which no party has an outright majority. In that 
case, the National Party would be forced to form an alliance with the right or 
the left, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives' platform calls for stricter enforcement of apartheid and the 
partitioning of South Africa into separate white and black states. The 
Democrats support a one-person, one-vote system that would bring blacks into 
government on an equal footing with whites. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which came to power in 1948 on a platform of strict racial 
segregation, has sought the political middle ground. While De Klerk remains 
committed to racially segregated schools, hospitals and residential areas, he 
has promised to start negotiations with black leaders and draw up a new 
constitution to share power but prevent "black domination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting for All 3 Houses 
</P>
<P>
The voting is for all three houses of Parliament, the white chamber as well as 
smaller chambers representing the country's 3 million mixed-race Coloreds and 1 
million Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders have declined to endorse any party. 
</P>
<P>
"The elections are a non-issue," said Hilda Ndude, Western Cape publicity 
secretary for the United Democratic Front, the 2-million-member anti-apartheid 
coalition banned from political activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our own program of action, election or no election," Ndude said in 
an interview. "There's no difference between the parties. Things will still be 
the same."

<P>
CLOSING IN ON THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE: LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the University of Miami laboratory of chemist Sidney Fox, tiny spheres of 
man-made protein dance a lively ballet under the microscope. "This could very 
well be what the first life looked like," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox is one of a handful of researchers who are carrying out experiments that 
many other scientists consider impractical or impossible, even heretical. 
</P>
<P>
He is pursuing the ultimate biological riddle -- nothing less than the creation 
of life in the laboratory, as most biologists believe it must have been created 
on Earth more than 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, Fox is combining simple chemical molecules that must have been 
present in the primordial soup of the Earth and subjecting them to artificial 
lightning and other energy sources. The results are primitive, cell-like 
spheres unlike anything that exists in the contemporary world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enduring Questions 
</P>
<P>
Fox insists that his and others' efforts to create life are not an attempt to 
achieve "godhood" or to demonstrate humanity's mastery over nature. Rather, 
they are an attempt to answer enduring questions that are at the very root of 
consciousness: "Where did I come from? Why am I here? What makes me unique?" 
</P>
<P>
If researchers are successful in creating life -- or some form of proto-life 
based on simpler molecules -- in the laboratory, the ramifications would be as 
vast as the universe itself. For one thing, that feat would give researchers 
new confidence that life started easily on Earth and may have started equally 
easily elsewhere, such as on other planets in this solar system and on planets 
orbiting other stars. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery may also give hints about why life required more than 3 
billion years on Earth to progress from single-celled organisms to the larger 
creatures that were the precursors of today's plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, on another level, the discovery could provide new answers about 
not only the meaning of our own lives, but also the larger purpose of life 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Fox believes that his protein spheres are a major step toward achieving his 
goal. "They meet the three classical criteria of a living system," he said. 
They carry out chemical reactions identical to many in human cells. They 
evolve. And they sometimes even seem to reproduce themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I would call them proto-cells," Fox said. "From the proto-cell, there could 
ensue evolution of modern cells. It would take an awful lot of evolution to get 
to modern cells, but the first cells must have had these same key properties." 
</P>
<P>
Fox and other researchers are trying to identify the chemical building blocks 
that must have existed in the prebiotic -- before life -- world and put them 
together in the same way that they must have been assembled in the first cells. 
</P>
<P>
Those building blocks include proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and 
ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the repository of genetic information, the 
blueprint of life. RNA serves as a working blueprint for the construction of 
proteins and other cellular components. 
</P>
<P>
Fox believes that he may be within 5 to 10 years of creating life with his 
proteinoid spheres. But other researchers consider Fox a maverick and believe 
that the problem is more difficult. They say such a leap may require another 20 
to 40 years, perhaps even more. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the quest to create life in the lab recently has cleared some 
significant, albeit preliminary, hurdles. The advances, as well as some 
illuminating failures, have generated new excitement for a number of 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intellectual Challenge 
</P>
<P>
The work is not expected, however, to produce organisms that might be of any 
practical use in medicine or science in the foreseeable future. Although life 
produced in the laboratory might, in the distant future, be genetically 
engineered for specific purposes, researchers view their work as more of an 
intellectual challenge than a practical problem. 
</P>
<P>
This is certainly the case with Stanley Miller and his colleagues at UC San 
Diego and the nearby Salk Institute, who have made some extremely primitive RNA 
molecules that, in a sense, replicate themselves, although not very well. "It's 
like the dog giving a sermon in church," Miller said. "It's not a very good 
sermon, but you're surprised that he does it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Fox are separated by more than a continent. They are worlds apart in 
their basic view of how life began. Fox favors the simplicity of proteins, 
arguing that life could have begun using only these simplest of molecules. 
Miller, in contrast, argues that only DNA or RNA can carry the genetic 
information necessary for reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Geneticists vs. Chemists' 
</P>
<P>
"The essential thing of a living organism is that it is self-replicating," 
Miller said. "And the only thing we know that self-replicates is DNA and RNA," 
molecules that store genetic information in cells. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been that way, the geneticists versus the chemists," said 
exobiologist (one who studies life off the Earth) Richard S. Young, a 
consultant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida. "The geneticists, of course, see the contemporary 
information-containing molecules as being DNA and RNA, and (they believe that) 
until one of those molecules was operating in the primitive organism or cell, 
you didn't have life." 
</P>
<P>
Chemists, however, "take a totally different view," Young said. The first 
information-carrying molecule "doesn't have to be as sophisticated as DNA. It 
could be a much simpler molecule, such as a protein. It just has to carry 
enough information for the first prototype organisms to replicate themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Though the debate over whether life was formed from proteins or RNA has few 
immediate, practical implications, it may play a crucial role in NASA's search 
for life elsewhere in the universe by showing what to look for. 
</P>
<P>
The search for life on Mars by NASA probes, for example, was biased toward 
identifying DNA. Most scientists now believe that the first life did not 
contain DNA, so that probe may have been preordained for failure. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the first life was based on DNA and RNA or on proteins, researchers 
have set themselves a tremendous task. Trying to synthesize life in the 
laboratory "is a terribly difficult problem," said biochemist Gerald Joyce of 
the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla. "Nature had a billion 
years to play with, the entire Earth to play with. We just don't have the time, 
so all we can do is try to learn something about the relevant reactions." 
</P>
<P>
"But difficulty does not mean impossibility," said chemist Cyril Ponnamperuma 
of the University of Maryland in College Park. "Just because something is 
difficult doesn't preclude it from happening in a primordial environment. We 
just have to keep going at it. I am optimistic about a solution." 
</P>
<P>
The scientific search for the origin of life began 37 years ago when Miller, 
then a young graduate student at the University of Chicago, performed an 
experiment that forever changed the way biologists viewed evolution. 
</P>
<P>
In a large flask, Miller combined methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water, which 
were believed to make up the atmosphere of the primordial earth. He then heated 
the flask and repeatedly passed an electric spark through the vapors. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks, Miller analyzed the contents of the flask and found at least 
four amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, as well as a variety of 
other compounds that play a role in life. Miller had proved what scientists had 
previously only hypothesized: that the complex chemicals on which life is based 
could be produced by essentially random processes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shed Little Light 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have since repeated Miller's experiments using a variety of starting 
materials and conditions and have shown that they can produce all 20 amino 
acids that are found in proteins, as well as the nucleotides from which DNA and 
RNA are formed. Because these experiments showed that either or both could be 
formed spontaneously, they shed little light on the DNA-versus-protein 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the chemicals have also been found in meteorites. Spectrographic 
studies in addition have shown that the chemicals are found on most asteroids, 
comets, planets and moons in the solar system, as well as in the voids between 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
The whole universe seems to be awash in organic chemicals waiting for the 
metaphorical spark that will transform them into living matter. 
</P>
<P>
Most researchers agree that the first life must have been much different than 
life today. And recently, some geneticists have begun to reach the conclusion 
that systems containing either RNA or DNA may be too complicated to represent 
the first forms of life. Some believe that simpler, as yet undiscovered, 
molecules must have played an important role, and they are trying to decipher 
what those simpler molecules may have been. 
</P>
<P>
The extremely sophisticated system by which cells function (see graphic) is 
clearly the result of millions, if not billions, of years of evolution. No one 
believes that even a rudimentary form of life containing all three components 
-- DNA, RNA and proteins -- could have sprung up as a result of random 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Essentially Unfathomable' 
</P>
<P>
"That such a complex mechanism could have been present at the beginning of 
organic evolution is, to even the most imaginative scientist, essentially 
unfathomable," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
If the first life must have been much simpler, researchers are forced to ask 
which of these macromolecular systems can be done away with and still have life 
-- a question that Fox said is the evolutionary equivalent of "which came 
first, the chicken or the egg?" The geneticists -- who include most people 
working on the origin of life -- have eliminated proteins and focused more on 
the "egg": DNA and RNA. 
</P>
<P>
Of this pair, RNA seems the more likely candidate as the first component of 
life, geneticists agree. "It's been pretty well accepted for maybe 20 years 
that life couldn't have started with DNA," Joyce noted. "There are chemical 
reasons why it is just not an appropriate molecule. So the focus has been more 
towards RNA." 
</P>
<P>
But that focus created a huge problem: RNA is fine as an information carrier, 
but if the first life were based on it, RNA would also have had to serve as a 
structural material for primitive organisms and carry out their metabolic 
functioning -- acting as a protein-like enzyme to provide cells with the energy 
necessary for life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'RNA World' 
</P>
<P>
Research in this decade revealed that RNA indeed can function as an enzyme. 
That realization has led to the conception of a primordial world, christened 
"RNA world" by Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert of Harvard University, in which 
RNA served as both genetic material and as enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists have had very little success in getting RNA to replicate itself 
and have run into a problem that makes them believe that replication probably 
could not have happened on its own (see graphic). 
</P>
<P>
That problem "really pushed us over the edge and forced us to say (RNA itself) 
just doesn't look like the first starting material." 
</P>
<P>
So now that geneticists have eliminated RNA, along with proteins and DNA, where 
does that leave them? Trying to find simpler molecules, "proto-RNA," that could 
function like RNA, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
How will they know if they've found the right thing? "There's sort of a slogan 
I have," Miller said: " 'If the results don't come easy, it's probably not 
prebiotic.' " So anything that could have been a prebiotic precursor of RNA 
will, by definition, replicate itself easily. 
</P>
<P>
And if they find several chemicals that work? "That kind of dilemma we'll worry 
about later," Miller said. "Right now, we don't have (even) one." 
</P>
<P>
But Fox is banking on proteins as the starting points of life. And ironically, 
by Miller's definition, Fox's system could well be prebiotic, for his results 
come very easy. When he heats a mixture of amino acids at a temperature that 
could be easily achieved on, say, a dry lake bed in summer, they react 
chemically to form proteins. When the proteins are immersed in water, they form 
his "proteinoid microspheres." 
</P>
<P>
These microspheres dance around under the microscope, impelled by random 
impacts with water molecules -- the same Brownian motion that causes dust motes 
to dance around in the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical of Life 
</P>
<P>
But the proteins in the microspheres carry out reactions typical of life, Fox 
said. Some catalyze the breakdown of molecules. Others do the opposite job of 
building molecules. In fact, Fox said, he and other researchers have found 
artificial proteins that carry out the same types of reactions as every class 
of enzymes found in living organisms. 
</P>
<P>
The microspheres even undergo a primitive form of "reproduction." Under the 
microscope, they can be seen to form buds on their surface, just like yeast and 
certain bacteria. These buds break off from the parent, and then grow by 
absorbing unaggregated proteins from the solution. Eventually, these "daughter" 
microspheres bud themselves, and the growth cycle is repeated. 
</P>
<P>
But these proto-cells cannot be considered alive because they cannot survive 
away from the "life-support system" provided in Fox's laboratory. Left to their 
own devices, they would simply dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
Fox first produced the proto-cells about 20 years ago and has been studying 
them ever since -- while futilely trying to persuade the geneticists that he is 
right and they are wrong. It is difficult to pin down exactly why they disagree 
with him so strongly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument Over Proteins 
</P>
<P>
One problem, said chemist James P. Farris of Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute 
in Troy, N.Y., is that "I have trouble finding anyone -- or at least very few 
people -- who would agree that proteins store information." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, however, argues that the proteins in his proto-cells do carry information, 
that the order of the amino acids in the proteins is not random. "They line up 
in quite strict order due to the interactions of the amino acids with each 
other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All that would have been necessary for life to begin, he added, was the 
appearance of a protein that could copy itself and other proteins as well. 
Evolution would then have made small changes in the order of the amino acids, 
leading to more efficient copying. Through his proto-cell research he is now 
trying to find such proteins and observe evolution. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario is supported by the fact that the amino acid order that appears 
in the proteinoid microspheres persists today in conventional proteins, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Order of Amino Acids Studied 
</P>
<P>
Chemists Orlin Ivanov of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia and 
Berthold Fortsch of the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Martinsried, 
West Germany, have studied the order of amino acids in 2,898 proteins -- all 
the proteins for which such information was available when they began their 
study in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
They concluded that all the proteins were descended from a small group of 
primitive proteins, and that those primitive proteins had amino acid sequences 
similar to those observed by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Fox remains the proverbial voice crying out in the wilderness. "I 
think it is embarrassing to them (the nucleic acid proponents) to recognize 
that there is an answer which shows that the way they have been thinking for so 
long is falsely based," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even Fox's supporters believe that he occasionally goes too far. "Every now 
and then he even implies that these things are, in a sense, alive, that he has 
demonstrated most of the characteristics of life," Young said. "I think he goes 
a bit far there, but up to that point I am inclined to agree with him." 
</P>
<P>
And some observers believe that the line between mere sophisticated chemistry 
and actual life is so fine that neither side may be able to conclusively prove 
its case. "If there had been an intelligent observer watching the Earth (during 
its first billion years), would he have been able to decide when life 
originated?" chemist Daniel Atkinson of UCLA asked. "I think he wouldn't have. 
It probably took thousands and thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SEARCH FOR FIRST LIFE 
</P>
<P>
Most scientists agree that life as it exists now is too complicated to have 
arisen spontaneously. Current life depends on an intricate interaction of DNA, 
RNA and proteins. Genetic information, the cell's blueprint, is carried in DNA 
in the order of its individual chemicals, called nucleotides, in the same way 
that information in a sentence is contained in the order of the letters that 
compose it. 
</P>
<P>
When the cell needs to synthesize a structural protein, for example, the 
protein's DNA blueprint is copied into RNA. The RNA serves as a working 
blueprint for synthesis of the protein from individual amino acids. Because 
this system is so complex, most researchers believe the first life must have 
incorporated only part of it. Many scientists believe that RNA in the first 
cells fulfilled the functions of both DNA and proteins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN NATURE 
</P>
<P>
RNA is composed of four chemicals, known as bases, called adenine (A), uridine 
(U), cytidine (C), and guanine (G) that are linked to the RNA backbone by a 
sugar called D-ribose (DR). Genetic information in RNA is encoded in the 
sequence of the four bases. When RNA is replicated, that information is 
preserved because A always pairs with U and C always pairs with G. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE LAB 
</P>
<P>
In the laboratory, researchers have been able to get RNA to replicate itself in 
only one instance, a short piece of RNA composed of only four bases -- two Gs 
and two Cs. When the molecule is placed in a test tube with two smaller 
molecules, each containing one C and one G, they bind to it and react 
chemically with each other. 
</P>
<P>
IN TROUBLE 
</P>
<P>
But researchers have run into a major problem in considering how RNA could have 
been the basis of the first Life. RNA contains only D-ribose, but when ribose 
forms in the primordial soup that must have existed on early Earth, both 
D-ribose and L-ribose, which are mirror images of each other like gloves for 
the left and right hands, are formed in equal quantities. And if L-ribose is 
incoporated into growing RNA, it brings the synthesis to an abrupt halt.

A car bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a crowded Christian 
neighborhood of Beirut, killing two people and wounding seven. Police said a 
Mercedes-Benz rigged with about 88 pounds of TNT exploded in the Mokalles 
district, on the southeastern edge of East Beirut. A pedestrian and the driver 
of a car parked near the Mercedes were reported killed. Elsewhere, Syrian and 
Christian gunners dueled across the city's dividing Green Line, and hundreds of 
Christian youths protested outside the U.S. Embassy, accusing the United States 
of supporting Syria's role in Lebanon.

Evangelist Jim Bakker suffered stress and not mental illness when he collapsed 
Thursday, his wife said. "After 2 1/2 years of sheer mental torture, he was 
just stressed out," Tammy Faye Bakker said in a taped statement telecast on the 
Jim and Tammy Show. Meanwhile, Bakker's lawyers filed a motion seeking a 
mistrial on grounds that the collapse of a witness during defense 
cross-examination last week in U.S. District Court in Charlotte, N.C., 
prejudiced the jury. The U.S. Marshal's Office said a hearing would be held 
today to determine if Bakker is competent to stand trial on fraud and 
conspiracy charges.

Former House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned from the House in June after 
being charged with ethics violations, has joined a Texas insurance firm as a 
special consultant, it was announced. Wright will work with American Income 
Life Insurance Co. of Waco, Tex. Company Chairman Bernard Rapoport said Wright 
will serve as a consultant to the firm's management and be available for 
motivational talks with the sales force and make other public appearances on a 
part-time basis. The announcement said Wright will not engage in congressional 
lobbying or in other formal contacts with government on behalf of any interest 
group. The statement did not say how much Wright would be paid.

JUSTICE DEPT. MAY PROBE RESPONSE TO RIOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department said it may investigate whether authorities used 
excessive force to quell weekend riots in Virginia Beach, Va., but local 
officials defended the actions of police and National Guard troops. "It's 
incredible that (the officers) were able to restore law and order without 
firing a single shot or using fatal force," City Manager Aubrey V. Watts Jr. 
said. Merchants spent the day cleaning up from the rioting, much of it by black 
college students attending the annual Greekfest. At least 100 businesses were 
looted, more than 1,000 people were arrested and 30 police officers or National 
Guardsmen were hurt, officials said. State civil rights leaders have said 
police overreacted, that the city and merchants made the students feel 
unwelcome and that police would have reacted differently had the crowd been 
white. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the FBI and the department's Civil 
Rights Division may probe the riot's handling after reviewing videotapes.

IRAQI DISASTER REPORTED

Up to 700 people were killed in an explosion last month at a secret defense 
establishment near Baghdad, where Iraq is believed to be developing new 
missiles, Britain's Independent newspaper reported. Quoting U.S. diplomats and 
Middle Eastern sources, the newspaper said the blast occurred Aug. 17, causing 
a blaze that firefighting planes took nearly a week to extinguish. The 
explosion at the complex near Hillah, 40 miles south of Baghdad, was apparently 
loud enough to be heard in the Iraqi capital, the newspaper said. It quoted 
U.S. diplomats as saying they had heard from Iraqi sources of a major incident 
in which casualties were "in the low hundreds."

Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) will get a seat on the House Agriculture 
Committee if he wins a Sept. 12 special election for a vacant congressional 
seat, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gebhardt (D-Mo.) said in Fresno. San 
Joaquin Valley farm interests traditionally have had a seat on the powerful 
committee. Condit is running against several Republicans and a Libertarian for 
the seat vacated last May by Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned when questions

A former San Francisco Bay Area corporation will lose its company cars -- a 
Maserati and a Jaguar -- at a public auction for failing to pay more than 
$168,000 in back taxes, officials said. The two luxury cars belonged to 
Certified Garment &amp; Linen Supply Inc. of Moss Beach, which failed to pay 
corporate income taxes from 1982 to 1988, said Jim Reber, spokesman for the 
state Franchise Tax Board. "I find it very difficult to picture these guys 
distributing towels in the back of a Maserati," Reber said. The company's 1977 
Maserati Khamsin, valued at $25,000 to $35,000, and its 1973 Jaguar XJ6 were 
seized by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department.

Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development have decided to 
revamp, rather than rescind, the troubled mortgage coinsurance program for 
multifamily housing that resulted in $700 million in defaulted mortgages and 
sparked a criminal investigation into one participant, the Washington Post 
reported. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's announcement, expected today, will follow a 
four-month review of the program. HUD will create a new Office of Coinsurance 
and set stricter eligibility requirements for lenders who want to do business 
with the government, sources said.

PROPOSAL INCLUDES FEE TO CLEAN UP OIL SPILLS 
</P>

Declaring that California has escaped a disastrous oil spill only because of 
"sheer blind luck," two state officials proposed legislation Tuesday that would 
impose a 50-cent-per-barrel fee on oil to pay for spill cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis proposed the fee as part of 
a legislative package that would make the oil industry in California subject to 
tough new fines and regulations designed to force it to take steps to prevent 
tanker spills along the state's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Both officials, who are members of the State Lands Commission, said hearings 
conducted after the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound had taught them that the industry cannot be depended upon 
to take adequate measures on its own either to prevent spills or clean up after 
one has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned was that California was spared (an oil spill) not because of 
adequate preparation, not because of appropriate caution, but out of sheer 
blind luck," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Oil Spill Program 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. disagreed, saying the 
industry has begun its own oil spill program by pledging $250 million to create 
five regional oil spill centers capable of reacting immediately to spill 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Currie said the industry is also supporting federal legislation that 
would create a $1-billion cleanup fund. 
</P>
<P>
"What the industry asks is that they (the state) work with the industry to 
ensure that everything works together on both the state and federal level," she 
said. The state legislation, to be sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) 
and Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), would: 
</P>
<P>
* Create a $500-million superfund to pay for oil spill cleanups. The superfund 
would be financed by the 50-cent fee imposed on each barrel of oil unloaded at 
a California marine terminal. 
</P>
<P>
* Promote earlier participation by the Coast Guard in cleanup operations by 
providing that money from the fund could be used to reimburse the federal 
government for Coast Guard involvement. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish tough new safety rules and make oil tanker and marine terminals 
subject to a maximum $100,000-a-day fine if they failed to comply with the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
* Impose a $10-a-gallon fine for every oil spill and a $30-a-gallon fine if the 
spill is caused by "willful misconduct or negligence." 
</P>
<P>
* Create an office of oil spill response to direct cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
* Require tanker operators moving across state waters to prove that they had 
the resources to cover their liability for any spill. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish coastal tanker control facilities to prevent collisions and 
groundings. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert, who is also chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Oil Spill 
Prevention and Response Preparedness, said he will conduct hearings on the 
proposed legislation throughout the fall and formally introduce it early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Widespread Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the public knew just how unprepared we are right now to prevent 
this nightmare there would be widespread outrage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert and Keene acknowledged that the oil companies would probably pass the 
new fees on to consumers in higher oil prices, possibly as much as half a cent 
per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they pass it on to the consumer?" Keene asked. "They'll try." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said any increases in gasoline prices would be small compared with 
the 19-cent-per-gallon average rise in prices after the Valdez incident. "If 
they (the consumers) get hit with a half-cent increase at the gas pump, at 
least they get something for it," he said.

ANGER LINGERS ON BEIJING CAMPUSES; INTELLECTUALS' ROLE NOW IN QUESTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The song is just a simple television advertising jingle about insect spray, 
probably inspired by American commercials: "We're bugs, we're bugs. Aaagghh! 
Enemy killers are coming. Run quick!" 
</P>
<P>
But when students at Beijing University banged pots and pans late one night a 
few weeks ago and sang the bug-spray jingle, "The Internationale" and China's 
national anthem, no one could mistake the message. 
</P>
<P>
"The Internationale" and the national anthem, which both call for uprising 
against oppression, had been adopted as theme songs of this spring's 
student-led pro-democracy protests. And for students to sing the bug song draws 
a not-subtle comparison to the night of June 3-4, when the Chinese army put an 
end to the demonstrations by shooting its way into Beijing, killing hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, of people who sought to block its path. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anger Continues to Smolder 
</P>
<P>
As the fall semester gets under way, anger continues to smolder on Beijing's 
campuses. In central government offices, the youngest members of China's future 
elite live in fear of being sent away from the capital. A new wave of 
anti-intellectualism threatens to undermine the nation's attempt at rapid 
economic modernization. 
</P>
<P>
"The damage already exists," commented a European diplomat. "The atmosphere is 
that people just don't want to work any more: 'Have you finished that report?' 
'Oh, I'm not feeling well -- the weather is so hot.' The role of intellectuals 
in society has been set back 10 years. Alienation has set in again." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, there is mostly silence. 
</P>
<P>
The late July outburst of pan-banging and singing at Beijing University, which 
involved a few hundred students, is the only campus protest to have broken out 
since June's martial-law crackdown. The alleged ringleader, a graduating senior 
who had not yet left campus, was quickly denied his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indoctrination Classes 
</P>
<P>
The most important student leaders of the spring demonstrations are under 
arrest, in hiding or in exile. Returning students must attend political 
indoctrination classes focusing on the thoughts of paramount leader Deng 
Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
With the apparent exception of older students who have had work experience 
before entering college, the entire freshman class of Beijing University, the 
most prestigious school in the nation, is scheduled to spend a year at a 
military camp before doing any course work. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also have announced that this spring's graduates, especially those 
in the social sciences, in most cases will not be allowed to pursue advanced 
degrees without first getting at least a year of work experience. For many, 
this could mean a move to a provincial town, with no guarantee of being able to 
return to Beijing or another big city. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are all really angry, but they don't dare speak about it," 
declared one undergraduate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of the new government policies," said another student. "I just 
hate the government. My friends at Beijing University and Qinghua University 
feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they were out there beating on plates and bowls and singing 'The 
Internationale' and the national anthem. They want to sing other songs, 
anti-government songs, but they know they will be kicked out or put in jail if 
they do. So they just go to their political study classes and pretend to agree 
with Deng's speeches. Then they leave with the same feelings of hatred and 
ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Off From World 
</P>
<P>
An attempt is also being made to cut students off from a watching world. At 
some schools, students have been warned that they will be punished if they 
speak with foreign diplomats or reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to China seems even more stark when a comparison is made with what 
might have been. When this spring's student-led wave of street protests first 
erupted, a key demand was for improved living and working conditions for 
China's educated elite, who generally draw salaries no higher than factory 
workers' wages. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the demonstrations, the government was drawing up plans for 
educational reforms aimed at raising the status of schoolteachers, especially 
those in the countryside, at increasing the independence of universities and at 
switching to a system by which college graduates find their own jobs rather 
than receiving assignments from the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Working Class 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the wake of the June crackdown that ended the demonstrations, Communist 
Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin is telling intellectuals -- meaning people 
with more than a high school education -- that they are part of the working 
class and that policy toward them will not change. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that in today's political environment, Jiang's comments are meant 
to be reassuring. What he means is there must be no return to the virulent 
anti-intellectualism of Mao Tse-tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when 
educated people were condemned as the "stinking ninth category." This was a new 
classification of evildoers added to eight previously labeled categories that 
included criminals and so-called counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's reassurances are needed because echoes of Cultural Revolution policies, 
which called for intellectuals to go to the countryside to be "re-educated" by 
the peasants, are reverberating through Beijing once again. 
</P>
<P>
The dreams of the Beijing Spring, including hopes that college graduates would 
routinely earn more than high school dropouts, that China would direct far more 
funding to education, that freewheeling discussion of how to solve China's 
immense problems would be allowed on campuses and in the press -- these dreams 
have been shattered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Chilling Order 
</P>
<P>
But beyond that, a chilling order has been transmitted through the central 
bureaucracy, demanding that all people working in government or Communist Party 
jobs at the national level who graduated from college in or after 1985 are to 
be transferred to low-level provincial jobs for at least one to two years. 
</P>
<P>
The full implications of this order are not yet clear, and it may never be 
rigorously carried out. In China, rules are bent by those who enforce them. The 
theoretical purpose of the order is to raise awareness of China's economic and 
social realities among the future elite. But there is widespread suspicion that 
the rule is meant to be selectively enforced, primarily against those who 
participated in the pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, it applies to everyone in the central government and central 
party organizations (who graduated in or after 1985)," commented a Western 
diplomat. "(But) it would be inconceivable to think this thing would be 
enforced universally and fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat first predicted flatly that the order would prove to be 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
"They need these people," he said. "They have nobody to replace them. They are 
not going to waste them." 
</P>
<P>
But after a moment's thought, he added: "That could change. It's a very 
contradictory picture." 
</P>
<P>
If the order were to be carried out, he said, "It would be devastating -- and 
Deng Xiaoping knows it would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaining 'Chinese Way' 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as the late 19th Century, and again during the past decade, some 
Chinese leaders have hoped to modernize the nation by bringing in Western 
science and technology but retaining a vaguely defined "Chinese way" of doing 
things -- basically meaning the essence of the system in place at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In the political spectrum of today's China, Premier Li Peng is often placed in 
this category, as someone who favors technical and scientific training but 
opposes the liberalizing influences of Western society. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including some of the key advisers who until recently were gathered 
around former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a reformist, have 
advocated far more fundamental changes in the structure of society and greater 
individual freedom as prerequisites for sustained economic growth. 
</P>

"You can't just import technology and expect it to do wonderful things for 
you," commented one of the diplomats. "You have to adopt a way of thinking that 
uses that technology efficiently. For example, if you don't have a free flow of 
information linking scientists to each other, that slows down the bouncing of 
ideas off other people and it slows down results." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severity Unknown 
</P>
<P>
It is still too early to know how harsh the treatment of educated young people 
and of intellectuals in general may be in the months and years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
China's top political leadership remains delicately balanced between those who 
wish to slow the pace of reform and those who wish to accelerate it. Deng, at 
85, is unlikely to last for very many more years as China's paramount leader, 
and the succession struggle is already unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
"The best of China's elite is now alienated," said the European diplomat. 
"These people were not anti-Communist. They had a chance to be part of the 
game, and now they are excluded from the game. But they can be put back in 
again if things change quickly."

ISRAELI SOLDIERS URGED TO DEFY IMMORAL ORDERS

<P>
A left-wing kibbutz movement has called on Israeli soldiers to refuse to carry 
out illegal or immoral orders when serving in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Elisha Shapira, a reserve lieutenant colonel and head of the Kibbutz Artzi 
movement, a group of 84 collective farms, said there has been an increase in 
incidents in which soldiers are ordered to beat Palestinians until their limbs 
break or to commit other excessive acts. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that in the field many irregular incidents are going on and 
soldiers are carrying out dozens and dozens of illegal orders," said Shapira, 
who performed his reserve duty near the West Bank town of Nablus earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Shapira said he learned of the excesses from his reserve service and through 
reports from members of the Kibbutz Artzi movement, which has 40,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Israel's collective farms have produced a disproportionate 
number of combat soldiers and pilots, including several chiefs of staff. 
</P>
<P>
The call to disregard illegal orders, first made on Israel Television on 
Monday, follows Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's announcement that new orders 
are being issued to soldiers, loosening restrictions on when they can use live 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers will now be allowed to use live rounds, day or night, against any 
masked suspect who disregards orders to halt. In the past, only plastic bullets 
could be used, and masked activists were subject to arrest primarily at night. 
</P>
<P>
Shapira said the call was not directly connected to Rabin's directive. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, Rabin issued an order saying soldiers should use "force, 
power and blows," as an alternative to gunfire, to quell Palestinian violence. 
</P>
<P>
The order was widely interpreted to mean that soldiers could beat Palestinian 
suspects as punishment, and Arab hospitals reported treating hundreds of broken 
bones. Orders were later clarified to say that soldiers could use only 
sufficient force to arrest suspects. 
</P>
<P>
More than 550 Palestinians have been killed and thousands more injured during 
the nearly 21-month intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Most have died as a 
result of gunshot wounds, although some deaths have been attributed to 
beatings. Thirty-five Israelis also have died in the violence.

Israel's security forces are hunting 700 Palestinians who they believe are the 
hard core of the uprising in the occupied territories, the army's chief of 
staff said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The wanted men are known in army slang as "bingos" because their identity card 
numbers are issued in long lists to troops in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff Dan Shomron told Parliament's foreign affairs and defense 
committee at a closed hearing that the army and secret police are concentrating 
on rounding up those who enforce the 20-month-old revolt against Israeli rule, 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
The wanted men are members of so-called strike forces that attack Arabs accused 
of collaborating with Israel, distribute leaflets and write graffiti to spread 
the orders of the uprising's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments Tuesday, Palestinian sources said that masked Arab youths 
beat to death a Gaza Strip resident accused of working with Israeli 
authorities, and Israeli media reported that the government has begun using 
helicopters to track down wanted Palestinians in remote villages and mountain 
hide-outs in the occupied West Bank.

THE PRESIDENT'S DRUG PLAN;

<P>
'TAKE DOWN' SECURITY GUARD;

L.A. OFFICERS FORGO SPEECH FOR THE STREETS 
</P>

<P>
Half an hour before President Bush began his speech, a Los Angeles Police 
undercover team arrested two crack dealers at a mini-mall a mile north of 
downtown, along with a third suspect, who surprised even veteran officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We took down a security guard," detective J. R. Thomas said. "The guy was 
watching the dope" -- serving as a lookout for the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The police radio squawked. Two plainclothes policewomen had made a buy at 
another mini-mall at 6th and Bonnie Brae streets. Thomas rushed off to check it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Bush started talking about "the greatest domestic threat facing our 
nation," a black woman in a straw hat was handcuffed and sprawled against a 
detectives' car at the second mini-mall and a Latino man about 30 was being led 
out of a pool hall by officers in blue L.A.P.D. Windbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Soon two young white men would be under arrest as well -- for trying to buy $8 
worth of crack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Reason for Optimism 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush was outlining his $7.9-billion "National Drug Control 
Strategy," the team of about two dozen police officers was at work among the 
realities of the crack problem in one of the nation's hardest hit cities. The 
evening on the streets would provide ample evidence of a problem cutting across 
racial and ethnic lines and give them little reason for optimism in any 
"comprehensive strategy" from the highest levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we can do anything with these people -- the adults," Thomas 
said as his officers drove off with three carloads of accused dealers and 
users. "Maybe if we start with the young ones. But it will take a considerable 
amount of time. Years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, throughout the Los Angeles area, it had been a busy day in the drug 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Glendale police announced the arrests of eight suspected 
Colombian traffickers, including a 71-year-old woman, and the seizure of more 
than 1,200 pounds of cocaine, most of it hidden in vaults under a false living 
room floor in a Monterey Park house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyer's Car Seized 
</P>
<P>
And in a news conference on the roof of Parker Center police headquarters 
downtown, Mayor Tom Bradley showed off a late-model Mercedes-Benz that was 
seized from a lawyer who allegedly tried to buy $50 in rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bradley had both praise and criticism for the Bush speech. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take anything we can get," he said. "The fact that the President has 
offered what appears to be a comprehensive attack is heartwarming." 
</P>
<P>
But, "clearly, it is not enough," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp similarly credited Bush with being "right 
on target," but he added that the President's strategy "doesn't go far enough 
to help us in California." 
</P>
<P>
He likened California to a man whose house is burning down and Bush to the 
neighbor who offers help with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobby for More U.S. Aid 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year, Los Angeles area officials have lobbied for more 
federal aid, chiefly by spotlighting the city's growing role as a 
drug-trafficking center. 
</P>
<P>
In January, federal and local narcotics agents in Los Angeles announced that 
they had seized more than $100 million in cash in 1988. It was the first time 
more cash was seized here than in Miami, although police in Miami had 
confiscated a greater quantity of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the heads of the Los Angeles offices of the FBI, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, U.S. Customs Service and other agencies joined county officials 
in complaining of an East Coast bias in allocation of federal drug-fighting 
funds. They said that it was the creation of a federally sponsored South 
Florida task force in 1982 that had prompted Colombian drug kingpins to bring 
much of their cocaine directly into California. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles campaign got a boost early last month, when a report by U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh described an alliance between the Colombian drug 
cartels and Los Angeles street gangs, which were said to be distributing crack 
cocaine to every corner of the nation. Southern California was also portrayed 
as home to clandestine labs producing 80% of the country's PCP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Bush Plan Inadequate 
</P>
<P>
Even before Bush's speech, local officials were calling the federal plan 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in recent weeks, Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate in the 1990 
gubernatorial race, has promoted his own operation CrackDown to add more than 
200 state drug agents and analysts, saying that "we can no longer wait for 
federal action." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was told that California will receive $40 million to $60 million 
through the Bush program, which he called "a drop in the bucket." No 
allocations of funds for local jurisdictions were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and Bradley came in for criticism themselves from Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who was among a group of officials briefed 
in the White House by Bush and William J. Bennett, the director of the White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"One is running for governor," Antonovich noted, adding that Bradley and the 
Los Angeles City Council have shown "a lack of leadership in addressing the 
crime needs of the citizens" by failing to increase the size of the Los Angeles 
police force since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praises President 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich lauded Bush, however, for recognizing that "police can't do 
everything" and for indicating that the drug fight "is going to require in our 
schools that values are taught and that our families and religious communities 
have a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Thomas' crew on the streets missed the speech. 
</P>
<P>
They had made 14 arrests on the shift, starting at MacArthur Park, then moving 
to surrounding areas when word spread of the police presence. First they would 
arrest the crack dealers at a spot, then station undercover officers there to 
wait for customers to approach them to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush was saying, "if you're a parent, talk to your kids," the officers were 
questioning the two final suspects of the shift, the two young white men, one 
23, the other 20. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you know to come here?" one of the officers asked the 23-year-old, a 
construction worker from Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend in Echo Park showed us this place, sir," he said. "We were going to 
get just $8 worth, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"How long you been smoking?" 
</P>
<P>
"Half a dozen times." 
</P>
<P>
"Half a dozen times too many," said a policewoman as the men were led off. 
</P>
<P>
Said detective Bob Freet: "Now that we've totally eliminated narcotics from the 
Free World, let's go home."

<P>
Here is a partial text of President Bush's speech announcing a $7.9-billion war 
on drugs: 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time since taking the oath of office that I felt an issue 
was so important, so threatening, that it warranted talking directly with you, 
the American people. All of us agree that the gravest domestic threat facing 
our nation today is drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice. Our courts, our 
prisons, our legal system are stretched to the breaking point. The social costs 
of drugs are mounting. In short, drugs are sapping our strength as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Most Serious Problem 
</P>
<P>
Turn on the evening news, or pick up the morning paper and you'll see what some 
Americans know just by stepping out their front door: Our most serious problem 
today is cocaine, and in particular, crack. 
</P>
<P>
Who's responsible? Let me tell you straight out. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who uses drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who sells drugs. 
</P>
<P>
And everyone who looks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, I will tell you how many Americans are using illegal drugs. I will 
present to you our national strategy to deal with every aspect of this threat. 
And I will ask you to get involved in what promises to be a very difficult 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
This is crack cocaine seized a few days ago by Drug Enforcement Administration 
agents in a park just across the street from the White House. It could easily 
have been heroin or PCP. It's as innocent looking as candy, but it is turning 
our cities into battle zones, and it is murdering our children. 
</P>
<P>
Let there be no mistake: This stuff is poison. Some used to call drugs harmless 
recreation. They're not. Drugs are a real and terribly dangerous threat to our 
neighborhoods, our friends and our families. 
</P>
<P>
No one among us is out of harm's way. When 4-year-olds play in playgrounds 
strewn with discarded hypodermic needles and crack vials -- it breaks my heart. 
When cocaine -- one of the most deadly and addictive illegal drugs -- is 
available to school kids -- school kids -- it's an outrage. And when hundreds 
of thousands of babies are born each year to mothers who use drugs -- premature 
babies born desperately sick -- then even the most defenseless among us are at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
These are the tragedies behind the statistics. But the numbers also have quite 
a story to tell. Let me share with you the results of the recently completed 
Household Survey of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It compares recent 
drug use to three years ago. It tells us some good news and, some very bad 
news. 
</P>
<P>
First, the good. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see in the chart, in 1985, the government estimated that 23 million 
Americans were using drugs on a "current" basis -- that is, at least once in 
the preceding month. Last year, that number fell by more than a third. That 
means almost 9 million fewer Americans are casual drug users. Good news. 
</P>
<P>
Because we changed our national attitude toward drugs, casual drug use has 
declined. We have many to thank: our brave law-enforcement officers, religious 
leaders, teachers, community activists, and leaders of business and labor. 
</P>
<P>
We should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and editorial coverage 
and, for the air time and space for anti-drug messages. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I want to thank President and Mrs. Reagan for their leadership. All of 
these good people told the truth -- that drug use is wrong and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Also Bad News 
</P>
<P>
But as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic reductions, there is 
also bad news -- very bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 8 million people have used cocaine in the past year, almost 1 million 
of them used it frequently once a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that, in spite of the fact that over-all cocaine use is 
down, frequent use has almost doubled in the last few years. And that's why 
habitual cocaine users -- especially crack users -- are the most pressing, 
immediate drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, is our plan? 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, I trust the lesson of experience: No single policy will cut it, 
no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound. To win that war against 
addictive drugs like crack will take more than just a federal strategy. It will 
take a national strategy, one that reaches into every school, every workplace, 
involving every family. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, I sent this document, our first such national strategy to the 
Congress. It was developed with the hard work of our nation's first drug policy 
director, Bill Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing this plan, we talked with state, local and community leaders, law 
enforcement officials and experts in education, drug prevention and 
rehabilitation. We talked with parents and kids. We took a long hard look at 
all that the federal government has done about drugs in the past. What's 
worked, and -- let's be honest -- what hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, people in government acted as if their part of the problem -- 
whether fighting drug production, or drug smuggling, or drug demand -- was the 
only problem. But turf battles won't win this war. Teamwork will. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, I'm announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated, cooperative 
commitment of all federal agencies. In short, this plan is as comprehensive as 
the problem. With this strategy, we now finally have a plan that coordinates 
our resources, our programs and the people who run them. 
</P>
<P>
Our weapons in this strategy are: the law and criminal justice system, our 
foreign policy, our treatment systems, and our schools and drug prevention 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
So the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have. What has been 
lacking is a strategy to effectively use them. 
</P>
<P>
Let me address four of the major elements of our strategy. 
</P>
<P>
First, we are determined to enforce the law, to make our streets and 
neighborhoods safe. So to start, I'm proposing that we more than double federal 
assistance to state and local law enforcement. Americans have a right to safety 
in and around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
And we won't have safe neighborhoods unless we are tough on drug criminals -- 
much tougher then we are now. Sometimes that means tougher penalties. But more 
often it just means punishment that is swift and certain. 
</P>
<P>
Rules Have Changed 
</P>
<P>
We've all heard stories about drug dealers who are caught and arrested -- again 
and again -- but never punished. Well, here the rules have changed: If you sell 
drugs, you will be caught. And when you are caught, you will be prosecuted. And 
once you're convicted, you will do time. 
</P>
<P>
Caught. Prosecuted. Punished.

LONG-TERM STUDY SHOWS FIBER MAY REDUCE COLON CANCER RISK

A diet high in grain fiber appears to inhibit the growth of rectal polyps, 
according to a four-year study of 58 patients reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This finding could mean good news for people at risk of colorectal cancer, the 
second leading cause of deaths from cancer, said government scientists. 
</P>
<P>
A team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Cornell 
University Medical College selected study subjects from patients with familial 
adenomatous polyposis, an inherited disorder characterized by a large number of 
polyps in the colon that almost always will progress to cancer without 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The patients had had the colon -- the large bowel -- removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Correlation Found 
</P>
<P>
The report of the team appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute used complex statistical techniques to show that "the ratio of rectal 
polyps to baseline was uniformly negatively correlated with high fiber" -- that 
is, the higher the fiber, the fewer the polyps. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the high fiber-group consumed an average of 22 grams of fiber a day, 
about twice what is contained in an average diet, through the inclusion of 
special cereals in their diet. Only about 10% of the population normally 
includes this much fiber. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies have suggested that high-fiber, low-fat diets might protect

prescribed diet for a long period -- four years for the NCI group -- are rare, 
however.

Encouraging Results

<P>
"The results reported by these investigators are encouraging for the management 
not only of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, but also others at 
risk of developing colorectal cancer, the second most frequent cause of cancer 
mortality in the Unite States," said an editorial in the journal. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers said it was not known whether the protective effect of grain 
fiber might also work in patients at risk for non-inherited polyps. "Enough 
correspondences exist between the two conditions to warrant active inquiry," 
their report said.

A Trans World Airlines jet with 151 people aboard had to dive suddenly to avoid 
another plane directly in its path at 37,000 feet, and five passengers were 
injured, an airline spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers in Chicago apparently steered the plane onto the 
collision course, TWA spokesman Don Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the Boeing 767 was forced to take the evasive action about 40 
minutes into the Paris-bound flight, Morrison said. The plane returned to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said five people suffered minor injuries when they were tossed about 
in the cabin. They were taken to hospitals after the plane returned to St. 
Louis.

NIXON BIRTHDAY MAY BE HOLIDAY IN YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yorba Linda, which once fought to be designated as the official birthplace of 
former President Richard M. Nixon, now wants to declare his birthday a city 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"President Nixon is definitely in fashion again," declared Yorba Linda Mayor 
Henry W. Wedaa, who proposed the Jan. 9 holiday for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to request a resolution designating 
the holiday. In two weeks, the council will decide whether to create a new 
holiday or substitute Nixon's birthday for an existing city holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a fine idea," said Councilman Mark Schwing. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels, Wedaa said, he finds that people rarely bring up the Watergate 
scandal that forced Nixon's resignation in 1974. Rather, he said, people often 
recognize Yorba Linda as Nixon's birthplace and the home of the Richard M. 
Nixon Presidential Library, which is scheduled to be completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This often leads to many positive comments about what a great President 
history is showing him to be," Wedaa said, adding that he hopes the Nixon 
Library will schedule special events to coincide with the new Nixon holiday.

COUNTY ORDERS KING HOSPITAL INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday ordered a health department 
investigation of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in response to what 
they described as "serious charges of substandard health care" at the 430-bed, 
county-operated hospital in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
The motion ordering an investigation followed a series of articles in The Times 
about King, which the supervisors said pointed out problems of "poor 
administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of 
space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing 
patient load." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who pushed hard for construction of the hospital after 
the Watts riots in 1965, said he was so distressed by charges of poor health 
care at King that he called top county health and administrative officials at 
home over the Labor Day weekend and ordered them to begin immediately looking 
into problems and drafting recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Hahn said he wants to "tighten down the ship" at King, 
especially with respect to doctors who may be working fewer hours than they are 
paid for. 
</P>
<P>
The other supervisors who were at Tuesday's meeting -- Deane Dana and Ed 
Edelman -- backed Hahn by approving a motion to make the investigation of King 
a "high priority." 
</P>
<P>
Shaking his finger and raising his voice, Hahn told Richard Dixon, the county's 
chief administrative officer: "Take this story as a positive thing. Do a good, 
thorough review of our system." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon pledged to do so and added, "While the article makes a number of 
allegations -- and there is no doubt in my mind, I'm sorry to say, that a 
number of problems have foundation in truth -- I think it is important to point 
out there are many dedicated employees, physicians and nurses at King that do a 
very good job for very needy people." 
</P>
<P>
William Delgardo, King's veteran administrator, said after the board meeting 
that he has "no qualms" about an investigation of the allegations by any 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll see we're doing a good job," he said. "Nobody ever said we 
didn't have problems. But they've been blown out of proportion and taken out of 
context." 
</P>
<P>
In a series of articles, The Times documented that a disproportionate number of 
patients are dying at King, compared to the county's two other major acute-care 
public hospitals. One recent study of hospital deaths among elderly patients 
throughout the nation ranked King in the worst 50 of 5,577 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Systemic Failures 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts who were asked by The Times to review a dozen cases of patient 
care concluded that there are systemic failures within the hospital, including 
lack of good management and supervision by qualified senior attending 
physicians. Hospital officials acknowledged that many full-time senior doctors 
at King have off-site private practices. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, director of health services for Los Angeles County, which 
oversees and operates King, was not available for comment Tuesday because he 
was in Sacramento on county business. But he sent supervisors a memorandum 
saying that he had already ordered the inspection and audit division of the 
health department to begin a full investigation of King. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said he has directed a top aide, Carl Williams, to "personally 
take charge" of exploring avenues for relief of problems at King. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility, Gates stated in a memorandum, would be to divert some of the 
patients now seeking care at King to other county or private hospitals. He said 
he will also explore "whether or not the hospital should continue, for the 
present, as a trauma center." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, assistant director for hospitals, testified at the board meeting that 
he was "mad" about reported problems at King. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Emergency Meeting' 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Butler, a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital Financial 
Authority, said in an interview that he was "shocked and also very enlightened" 
by the disclosures in The Times. He said he is seeking to convene an "emergency 
meeting" of the community-based authority -- which is trying to float bonds to 
build a new trauma center at King -- to explore "quality of care issues . . . 
and supervision." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dealing with the hospital from the fiscal standpoint," Butler said. 
"But there's a human factor here that we have not been exposed to. . . . A 
number of people are losing their lives."

'MIRACLE' ON 135TH ST.: 14 IN AUTO ESCAPE DEATH IN PLUNGE INTO PIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what authorities describe as "a miracle," 14 people jammed into a car 
survived a 70-foot plunge into a gravel pit, with most suffering only minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A 1971 Oldsmobile carrying three adults and 11 children careened off a Compton 
road and down into the 70-foot-deep rock quarry Monday night about 9:20 after 
the driver swerved to avoid hitting another car that had darted in front of 
her, Detective Michael Markey of the Compton Police Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Markey said no one in the Oldsmobile Delta 98 was wearing a seat belt when it 
went off the road on 135th Street, near McKinley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle that nobody was seriously hurt," Markey said. "I'm really 
surprised. The car didn't roll over either. It just went down and landed on all 
four wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Markey said he was also surprised that no one was thrown from the car. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone had been thrown from the car, there might be somebody dead," he 
said. "They might not have been thrown clear of the car, and it could have 
crushed them." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the victims were hospitalized in stable to fair condition at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Burns, a 34-year-old passenger from Compton, suffered the worst 
injuries -- ankle and jaw fractures -- according to King spokeswoman Paula 
Wauls. Burns was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone we have is doing pretty well," Wauls said. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-year-old girl was treated at King and released. 
</P>
<P>
Another five victims, including the driver, Geneva White, were taken to 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
White, 32, of Lynwood, suffered scratches and minor back injuries, Markey said. 
She was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
The third adult, Deborah Gatson, 34, also of Compton, was listed in fair 
condition at Harbor-UCLA with minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The other victims were also listed in stable to fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Three other victims were treated at Dominguez Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the hospitals would not release the identities of the children, 
who ranged in age from 9 months to 16 years. The relationship of the children 
to the adults was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not release information on where White and her passengers were 
going at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that the accident occurred when a red Mercury Capri cut 
in front of White's car and forced her off the road, Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
"No alcohol came into play in this," he said. "At least not from the victims' 
side." 
</P>
<P>
The detective said the skid marks left as White tried to stop her car showed 
that she was driving about 39 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Markey said the car skidded through the chain-link fence at the rock quarry, 
which belongs to the Atkinson Brickyard Co., and rolled down the slope of the 
quarry. 
</P>
<P>
"The car knocked down about 80 feet of the fence," said John Norwood, an 
Atkinson spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Markey said the Oldsmobile plummeted into the pit but never overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"It just stayed stable, and the front end hit the bottom of the pit," he said. 
"But it didn't flip over or roll over like other cars might. That was really 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
He linked the size of the Oldsmobile, a long, luxury sedan, to the fact that no 
one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty sturdy car," he said. "That's probably what saved them. The car 
is so big." 
</P>
<P>
He said police are investigating the incident, although tracking down the Capri 
will be nearly impossible.

SUSPENSIONS SEEN NO RISK TO DRUG CASES; 
</P>
<P>
PROSECUTOR REVIEWS ARRESTS BY NARCOTICS UNIT UNDER SUSPICION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA and DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top Los Angeles County prosecutor said Tuesday that the suspensions of nine 
members of a Sheriff's Department narcotics team in an alleged money-skimming 
scheme are not likely to jeopardize any major narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Schirn, head of the district attorney's major narcotics division, 
said his office still is searching for court cases involving the officers. 
</P>
<P>
Schirn said that a weekend review of nearly 200 pending drug cases had 
uncovered five that probably will require testimony from one or more of the 
suspended officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken Off Job 
</P>
<P>
The eight deputies and a sergeant -- most of them senior members of a major 
narcotics investigative unit -- were taken off the job last Friday as Sheriff 
Sherman Block announced that team members were suspected of stealing money 
seized in drug raids. Block called the case potentially the worst corruption 
case in his seven-year tenure as head of the nation's largest Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, who made up one of a handful of teams based in the department's 
narcotics bureau in Whittier, were placed on administrative leave as federal 
and county investigators look into allegations that they misappropriated tens 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
One federal law enforcement source said that at least $200,000 might have been 
taken over the last year. There was no indication that narcotics were also 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Friday's announcement, Schirn spent the Labor Day weekend 
reviewing pending cases in his office and identified those involving members of 
the narcotics team. He said in at least five cases, the officers were included 
as possible witnesses for the prosecution. Schirn said Tuesday that the cases 
have not been jeopardized by the alleged misappropriation of cash and that 
officers from other agencies also participating in the drug raids could provide 
the needed evidence. But he cautioned that prosecutors can only wait to see how 
the investigation unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
"All it means is that members of that team were involved in these cases," 
Schirn said. "Until we receive some definitive word that they are unable to 
testify or that their credibility is damaged, we will continue to prosecute 
these cases." 
</P>
<P>
Schirn would not elaborate on the specifics of the cases he had singled out but 
said one involved the seizure of as much as 800 pounds of cocaine which had a 
wholesale value of $8 million to $12 million. Several other cases involved the 
confiscation of drugs in the 10-kilo range, he said. Schirn, however, declined 
to say how many of the five cases involved drug money found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing the case against the deputies, Lawrence Lawler, FBI agent-in-charge 
of the Los Angeles office, said Friday that investigators had found that some 
of the money seized in drug raids had never made it to the evidence locker. 
</P>
<P>
Both the FBI and the Sheriff's Department refused comment Tuesday on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The officers placed on administrative leave are Sgt. Robert Sobel, a 19-year 
department veteran who once headed the narcotics unit at the Lennox sheriff's 
station, and Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, 
Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel R. Garner and 
Michael J. Kaliterna. All were relieved of duty, but they will continue to be 
paid and will be allowed to carry a badge and gun. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the suspected officers said Tuesday that they have braced 
themselves for arrest, but there is no indication that such action appears 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, several Sheriff Department sources suggested that in suspending the 
entire narcotics team -- including two members who reportedly joined the unit a 
few months ago -- authorities appear to be unsure who is responsible for the 
allegedly misappropriated funds. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said federal agents, including investigators from the Internal 
Revenue Service, are now busy trying to determine whether any officers may be 
living beyond their means -- an indication that they may have been involved in 
misappropriation. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, an attorney for the deputies' union, however, said he had 
spoken to most of those named in the case and said they were upset at the 
allegations and at being publicly targeted by Block. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes as a shock to them," said Shinee, who added that he is still 
collecting information. "These are serious allegations they face."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-DEPUTY FILES $400-MILLION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross Tuesday filed a 
$400-million suit against the city of Los Angeles and Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates for alleged civil rights violations stemming from his arrest on murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was held for 82 days earlier this year on suspicion of killing three 
South-Central Los Angeles prostitutes, largely due to Los Angeles Police 
Department ballistics tests linking his gun to the murders. But the charges 
were dropped May 15 when outside ballistics experts concluded that the evidence 
was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was arrested by Los Angeles police in late February with an alleged 
prostitute in his car in South-Central Los Angeles. According to the lawsuit, 
the woman told Ross she was stranded, had no money and needed a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which includes Ross's wife Sylvia as a plaintiff, claims that the 
former deputy was beaten during his arrest, that he was not allowed to call a 
lawyer during questioning, that his wife was kept in their home for hours after 
his arrest and that their home was searched without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the 41-page suit charges the city, Gates and 11 LAPD 
officers and detectives with false arrest and imprisonment, unlawful search and 
seizure, filing false arrest reports, battery and malicious prosecution.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOUGHNUT VENDOR SLAIN IN HOLD-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vendor known as the "doughnut man" to his customers in Watts was shot to 
death Tuesday during an apparent robbery attempt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Ayala, 28, who was familiar to residents around the Imperial Courts 
housing project for selling doughnuts and candy from his white van, was shot 
across the street from the project, said Los Angeles Police Officer Jim Farris. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Ayala had stopped at the intersection of 113th Street and Gorman 
Avenue along his regular route when a 14-year-old boy and another teen-ager 
approached the van and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
Before the victim responded, the 14-year-old fired a single shot, striking 
Ayala in the chest as he sat in the driver's seat, Farris said. Ayala was taken 
to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
"The doughnut man was nice," said a neighbor who asked that her name not be 
used. "When the kids didn't have enough money, he would let them go with 
whatever they did have. I think some of the little ones had credit with him."

LEGAL GROUPS ASSAIL COUNTY WELFARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daylong waits for assistance, lack of attention paid to the mentally ill and 
cutoff of benefits without warning are just some of the problems in Los Angeles 
County's welfare system that keep homeless people on the streets, a group of 
prominent attorneys told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, along with recommendations to correct the problems, grew out of 
visits to welfare offices made by hundreds of law clerks and attorneys who 
volunteered to provide free legal assistance to welfare recipients. The clerks 
and attorneys came from a cross section of Los Angeles law firms, including 
some of the city's biggest and most prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hundreds of Instances' 
</P>
<P>
They found "hundreds of instances in which the county Department of Public 
Social Services erroneously denied homeless and other impoverished Los Angeles 
residents basic, subsistence-level benefits," representatives of the County Bar 
Assn. and Public Counsel, the public interest law office of the county Bar and 
the Beverly Hills Bar Assn., told supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela A. Mohr, director of the Homeless Project for Public Counsel, said that 
when the law students go to welfare offices, "often times, as they walked down 
the street, they hear shouts of 'The lawyers are coming! The lawyers are 
coming! ' " 
</P>
<P>
"The students are mobbed with clients the minute they walk into the office," 
she said. Gail Ruderman Feuer, chairwoman of the county Bar Assn.'s individual 
rights section, said the project showed "just how pervasive are the flaws" in 
the county's welfare delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the board, the lawyers accused the county of failing to assist 
the homeless mentally ill in filling out complicated forms to qualify for 
welfare in apparent violation of a court order. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations are contained in a lawsuit filed by the city charging 
that the county has been derelict in carrying for the homeless and seeking to 
force the county to provide more housing and relief for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one client in the Echo Park office who was huddled in a corner for 
about seven hours, who was being totally ignored by everyone, started crying, 
was still ignored, and there was no one there to provide him with any kind of 
assistance," Mohr told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people give up," Mohr said. "They leave the office and won't get the 
assistance they need. It seems like it's set up to encourage that." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Loder, co-chair of the Committee on the Homeless for the county Bar 
Assn.'s individual rights section, told supervisors that the county's failure 
to provide special assistance "prevents hundreds of mentally ill and disabled 
people from receiving essential benefits that could forestall homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers accused the county of wrongfully cutting of benefits to recipients. 
County rules impose a 60-day cutoff of benefits to healthy recipients who fail 
to try to find work. But the lawyers claimed that benefits were cut off to some 
recipients who were physically unable to work. They also contended that the 
penalty can be too severe, citing the case of a man who lost his benefits 
because he arrived late for work. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also complained about average waits of eight hours at welfare 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not uncommon to find people who had waited an entire day to receive the 
relief they desired," the report said. "And, it was not unusual for a client to 
have waited an entire day in the DPSS office only to be told at the end of the 
day to return the following day." 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations made by the lawyers was elimination of the 60-day 
penalty "for all but the most severe violations," adding staff to assist the 
mentally ill and people who cannot read or write, and staggering of 
appointments to reduce waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors ordered welfare officials to respond to the lawyers' report in 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
County Welfare Director Eddy S. Tanaka told supervisors: "We'll take a look to 
see if, in fact, these allegations are accurate and take appropriate action." 
He insisted, however, that his office does not cut off benefits without 
warning. He also said his office assists the mentally ill in qualifying for 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that funding cuts have made it more difficult for his 
department to serve the 925,000 people on public assistance in Los Angeles 
County.

TORRANCE POLICE ACTION CALLED A 'PERVERSION' IN TRIAL ON TEEN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for a San Pedro father told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury Tuesday 
that Torrance police committed an "unspeakable perversion" by covering up a 
colleague's drunk driving in an accident that killed the man's teen-age son. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments at the end of a six-week civil trial, attorney Browne 
Greene asked jurors to hold the Torrance Police Department liable for the 
cover-up to "send a message that nobody in this city, in this state or in this 
community is above the law." 
</P>
<P>
Greene represents John Rastello of San Pedro, who sued five years ago alleging 
that his son, Kelly, was killed in an accident caused by off-duty Torrance 
Police Sgt. Rollo Green. The lawsuit claims that Green was driving drunk and 
made an illegal left turn, causing the accident, but that his police "buddies" 
covered up for him as part of a pattern of concealing police abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers conceded that Green had been drinking, but said he was not 
drunk. They said Rastello, 19, caused his own death by speeding on his 
motorcycle and failing to apply both of his brakes. They also argued that an 
unprecedented review of internal police files proved that Torrance investigates 
and disciplines its officers properly. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has has been closely watched for the unprecedented review that it has 
provided of internal affairs files and discipline in the county's third-largest 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rastello, his seven surviving children and supporters filled one 
side of the cramped courtroom. Rastello's wife, Geraldine, died of cancer last 
December. Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash, Sgt. Green and seven other 
officers -- all defendants in the case -- sat across the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
They heard attorney Greene focus on 14 acts of alleged misconduct for which he 
said Torrance police received little or no discipline. "What this department 
did . . . encouraged more violence and more misconduct," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges were filed in only one of the cases and in that instance, 
Greene said, the policeman was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Would that have happened to you or I?" Greene asked. "If you are a police 
officer in Torrance and you drink and drive, that's OK. You're going to get 
away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the permissive attitude began when Chief Nash discontinued his 
predecessor's policy of asking the California Highway Patrol to investigate 
accidents involving Torrance police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's policy led the department to cover up Sgt. Green's culpability on the 
night of the accident, Greene said. To prove that, Greene pointed out: Sgt. 
Green was not given a blood-alcohol test despite the fact that several 
witnesses smelled alcohol on his breath; a field supervisor used one of the 
department's few untaped phone lines to report in from the scene; Green wasn't 
arrested but was driven home by police, and Green did not seek medical care 
because he knew emergency room personnel would take a blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
Greene asked the jury to award Rastello more than $12 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued that Torrance police conducted a thorough and 
impartial investigation on the night of the crash. Casey Yim, the city's lead 
attorney, pointed out the department called two supervising sergeants, an 
accident investigation team and a drunk-driving specialist to investigate the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The specialist, Officer Daniel Metzger, used an eye-gaze test to conclude Sgt. 
Green was not driving under the influence, Yim said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Phantom Witness' 
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the crash cannot be held liable because the law provides 
that they are protected from civil claims if they act in good faith, Yim said. 
He said Rastello failed to prove the officers acted with malice. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Green's lawyer, Will Pirkey, said that only Tony Andrie of San Pedro 
testified that Green was unsteady on his feet and clearly intoxicated just 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
But Pirkey called Andrie a "phantom witness," who no one else saw at the scene 
of the crash, or at the hospital, where Andrie testified that he went to check 
on the crash victim. 
</P>
<P>
Pirkey said Andrie should not be trusted because he was a high school 
acquaintance of Kelly Rastello and because he did not come forward until four 
years after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
As to the allegation that Torrance police routinely conceal misconduct, Yim 
argued that the Police Department had thoroughly investigated its own officers, 
creating the mass of files on which the plaintiffs based their case.

PARK REBOUNDS WITH A KEY ASSIST BY MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At East Compton Park, where loitering gang members and drug dealers often 
outnumber children at play, things started falling into place Tuesday like 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Laker star Earvin (Magic) Johnson and three other National 
Basketball Assn. players dropped in at the Atlantic Avenue playground to teach 
youngsters about dribbling, slam-dunking and free-throwing. By the end of the 
day, the park itself was learning about rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the enthusiastic turnout, recreation officials began making plans 
for the playground's first-ever after-school reading program. Leaders of a 
community sports league talked of introducing new teams at the park. And 
mothers who had escorted their children to the playground without fear for the 
first time in years were thinking about coming back. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of it all was the 6-foot, 9-inch Magic. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Laker guard brought along teammates Larry Drew and Michael 
Cooper and the Los Angeles Clippers' Gary Grant for a free basketball clinic 
for neighborhood youngsters. Johnson arranged for free T-shirts, tennis shoes 
and lunches for the 300 children who signed up in advance for the two-hour 
sports tutorial. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of others, including adults, turned out to listen to the basketball 
tips and admire the sports stars up close. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I wouldn't let my kids come to the park because it's too rough," 
said Lawana Stephen, a Compton mother of three. "But this kind of activity is 
nice. It gives kids who would probably just be hanging out something good to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The expanded after-school park program was proposed Tuesday to Johnson by Mary 
Lee Gray, senior deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana. She told 
Johnson marketing manager Lon Rosen that the basketball star had brought "kids, 
adults, senior citizens, ex-gang members" and others together to East Compton 
Park for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen said Johnson readily agreed to back the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things that Magic wants to try here," Rosen said. "He knows the 
importance of role models to children." 
</P>
<P>
Details about the after-school program will be worked out in coming days, Rosen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Backers hope that Johnson -- either with his own funds or sponsors -- will 
provide some of the money necessary to run the program, while the county and 
local groups and such clinic participants as the Community Youth Sports and 
Arts Foundation and the Brotherhood Crusade contribute matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
The new athletic program was promised by Los Angeles County sheriff's officials 
who run a growing sports league program from the sheriff's Lynwood station, 
said Bob McCall, a county recreation supervisor in charge of East Compton Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It took something like this to get things going," McCall said, watching lines 
of children practicing their free-throws under Johnson's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Manny Anaya, a coordinator of the program and one of those 
helping at Tuesday's basketball clinic, said sheriff's sports programs already 
established at other parks include karate, baseball, soccer, baseball and 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Working with groups of 50 youngsters between the ages of 6 and 18, Johnson and 
the other professional players managed to offer each child some personalized 
instruction during the two-hour clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"You just open your arms and say, 'I care, I love you,' " Johnson explained 
during a break. "The motivation is to let people know that other people care 
about them and they don't have to turn to crime or drugs." 
</P>
<P>
From the background, Lynwood resident Charlie Edwards watched as Johnson put 
his own two sons, Rance, 11, and Christopher, 13, through their paces. "Things 
like this can give kids incentive," said Edwards, a pipe fitter. "It puts 
something other than gang things on their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Jason Keith of Los Angeles was enthralled when Johnson put his 
hands on his shoulders. Magic reached down to steady the boy when his shot 
toward the hoop fell about five feet short. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was his son," Jason grinned afterward. "It felt good."

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS WON'T HELP FAN THE FLAMES FOR ANY TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
Who, what and where is the Los Angeles football fan? 
</P>
<P>
Is the Los Angeles football fan someone who roots for the Anaheim team that 
used to play in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Is the Los Angeles football fan someone who roots for the former Oakland team 
that currently plays in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Did the Rams, who from 1937-45 played in Cleveland, take their L.A. football 
fans with them in 1980 when they moved to Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Did the football fans of Los Angeles abandon the Rams the exact minute they 
changed addresses, or was it two years later, when another National Football 
League team, the Raiders, hit town? 
</P>
<P>
Or, did they stay true to the Rams, no matter where the team went? 
</P>
<P>
Would a Raider football fan give or return his or her love to the Rams if the 
Raiders moved away, leaving the nation's second-largest city without an NFL 
franchise? 
</P>
<P>
(If such a prospect seems unfair, what is fair about Los Angeles having two pro 
basketball franchises and Orange County none?) 
</P>
<P>
And hey, what about the Orange County football fan? Does he or she resent the 
fact that the Anaheim-based team continues to call itself the Los Angeles Rams? 
Or, is it best that the Rams stay true to the same name they have used proudly 
for 43 years? 
</P>
<P>
We can tell you one thing, at least: 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing anymore as a "Los Angeles" football fan. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles isn't Los Angeles anymore. There are Dallas fans, Miami fans, New 
England fans, Chicago fans, but no L.A. fans. The species, long endangered, is 
extinct. 
</P>
<P>
At least New Yorkers have had both of their teams, the Giants and Jets, pretty 
much from scratch, no matter which New York or Jersey stadium they called home. 
But imagine if the Washington Redskins moved to Baltimore, and later the New 
York Jets to Washington. Which team would the "Washington fan" then support? 
</P>
<P>
That is what has happened to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
A person must decide what matters most -- geography, tradition, personnel, 
success, color of uniform, whatever -- before choosing a favorite pro football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
One factor that hasn't helped the Rams much is that they have not won an NFL 
championship in 38 years, and only one since leaving Cleveland in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they should be flattered that they have retained any followers at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are no longer Hollywood's football team, even though their advisory 
board includes everyone from comedian Bob Hope and composer Henry Mancini to 
one of Ronald Reagan's daughters and one of John Wayne's sons. Owner and 
president Georgia Frontiere has a surprisingly low profile for someone with 
such a colorful resume, and gets little of the publicity or notoriety that Al 
Davis of the Raiders receives. Ram second-in-command John Shaw remains one of 
the most publicly invisible top executives in pro sports, more anonymous than 
an offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders, the widely known Davis is referred to in the media guide as 
"president of the general partner," whatever that means. There also are 10 
limited partners, ranging from Eugene and Rita Boscacci to Wilfred Winkenbach, 
whoever they are. The average Raider football fan probably assumes that Davis 
is the team's sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to Los Angeles, the Raiders have swung Hollywood's spotlight from 
the Rams. While Howie Long has had soup commercials and Lyle Alzado and the 
late John Matuszak have had leading roles in action films, Ram players, former 
or current, have gone virtually unnoticed by advertisers and film makers. This 
was one of Eric Dickerson's many gripes before being traded to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their successes and reputations on and off the field, a Raider 
player might be more appealing to a new NFL fan -- say, a child -- no matter 
where in Southern California this individual resides. There now are younger 
fans who still don't know that the Rams ever played anywhere but Anaheim, just 
as there are Oakland children who like the San Francisco 49ers because there is 
nobody else nearby to like. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, in a more conservative, clean-cut, Michael J. Fox-influenced 
generation, maybe the Rams are becoming more popular with young people. It 
hasn't hurt the Rams any that they have had winning records in every season 
except one since 1982, while the Raiders have not had any winning seasons since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance-wise, the Rams on three occasions topped the 100,000 mark at the 
Coliseum, including 102,368 for a 1957 game against the 49ers. They will never 
know how many they could draw in Orange County, because the 67,037 they pulled 
in for a 1984 game against the Giants had people standing in aisles and 
practically sitting on one another's laps. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have attracted three crowds of 90,000-plus at the Coliseum, and had 
86,027 for last year's visit by the Rams. Only three other Raider home games 
last season, however, drew crowds larger than 49,000, and 1989 exhibition-game 
attendance has dropped into the lower 30s. We can't be sure how someone in the 
Southland decides which team to support, presuming he or she was born and 
reared here. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is even a rebel or two with an unusual cause -- a Los Angeles 
football fan who remains loyal to the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
How many people have forgotten, or never knew, that the Los Angeles Chargers 
belonged to the American Football League in 1960? Their owner was Barron 
Hilton, the hotel king, and the league's commissioner was Joe Foss, the former 
South Dakota governor. 
</P>
<P>
On the day they defeated Denver for the AFL title, the L.A. Chargers drew 9,928 
fans. Hilton took a $900,000 bath in his first year, and immediately moved the 
team to San Diego's 34,000-seat Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Had Los Angeles people given these guys the time of day, maybe the Chargers 
would be Hollywood's team today. Maybe Al Davis would have moved the Oakland 
Raiders someplace else -- Salt Lake City, perhaps, or Las Vegas, or North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland actually was an 11th-hour replacement for Minneapolis as the eighth 
club in the AFL. Had there been no Oakland, there might have been no Raiders. 
The Rams today could have owned all of L.A.'s hearts and minds, as they did 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams may be thought of as a conservative organization, but this was a team 
that 30 years ago acquired running back Ollie Matson from the Chicago Cardinals 
for nine players. The Rams were on everybody's lips that day, much as they were 
two decades later, when they acquired Joe Namath, or three decades later, when 
the wild, three-team Dickerson trade came down. 
</P>
<P>
Also, never forget the history-making move of 1972, when two owners, Carroll 
Rosenbloom of the Baltimore Colts and Robert Irsay of the Rams, traded their 
franchises to one another. In contrast, his acquisition of Dickerson 15 years 
later must have seemed to Irsay like small potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot help but sense that football lovers, in Los Angeles and elsewhere, 
generally talk about the Raiders more than they do the Rams. Raider merchandise 
is seen far and wide, the world over, and during the last two decades they have 
had far more readily identifiable players. 
</P>
<P>
The typical L.A. football fan need not support a losing team, as there is 
plenty else to do on Sundays in an area known for its weather and beaches and 
entertainment outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the population of the greater Los Angeles and Orange County region 
is so huge, even a lousy team figures to attract something of a crowd. And, if 
the Raiders leave, a Ram ticket could become a lot more difficult to come by 
than it is today. Within a few years, circumstances permitting, the Rams could 
become one hot property. 
</P>
<P>
And the L.A. Coliseum, in turn, could start bidding to bring the Rams back 
inside the city limits, which then would really turn the typical Los Angeles 
football fan into one confused individual. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of scenarios to consider, including this one: 
</P>
<P>
What if the Raiders elect to stay in Los Angeles, and Sacramento makes a bid 
for the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
If you think it can't happen, remember that there are still thousands of people 
in Ohio who thought they would never be abandoned by their beloved Cleveland 
Rams.

<P>
OK, class, open your textbooks to the chapter on how to win the Super Bowl. And 
no more spitwads! 
</P>
<P>
Last season it was lectures on the nutritional hazards of eating cold pizza for 
breakfast. This year, maybe Ram Coach John Robinson pulls out the slides on 
dental hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
The Eric Dickerson trade has turned the Indianapolis Colts around and the Ram 
roster inside out. Fresh from a 4-1 exhibition season, the Rams steam toward 
Sunday's opener against the Atlanta Falcons with 27 players 26 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains: Is this team old enough to win big? The Rams nearly 
pulled it off last year, finishing in a three-way tie in the NFC West at 10-6. 
But 12 veterans are gone from that team. 
</P>
<P>
The Dickerson trade left the Rams young and restless. And now the scrutiny 
begins in earnest. The team is through shopping with Dickerson draft picks and 
received for him the following seven players: Greg Bell, Gaston Green, 
Cleveland Gary, Frank Stams, Fred Strickland, Aaron Cox and Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a haul, sure, but who won? 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be years before you can fully determine that," football analyst 
Joel Buchsbaum said. "I think the bottom line on the deal is that, since the 
trade, all three teams (Rams, Colts and Buffalo Bills), have been to the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
One team, though, came out ahead in the numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are the team you have to wait on," Buchsbaum said. "They have so many 
guys . . . they could be terrific." 
</P>
<P>
But when? This year? 1993? No one knows for sure. Some experts are picking the 
Rams to supplant the San Francisco 49ers in the division despite some serious 
questions, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inside linebacker: The Rams opened training camp with two new starters, 
Strickland and Larry Kelm, but they've been hurt most of the summer, leaving 
free agent Richard Brown and a cast of dozens to plug up the middle. Wait till 
Dickerson gets the scouting report. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back: Gaston Green is much improved from last season, averaging 
four yards a carry as the main back this summer, but he also fumbled four 
times. Green seems destined for a role of spot runner and big-play back. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell proved he could carry the load last season, finishing as the NFL's 
fourth-leading rusher with 1,212 yards. But he spent the summer in a blue funk 
trying to settle a contact dispute. Bell finally signed last week, but he 
wasn't happy about it, which isn't the best of signs from a back whose attitude 
has sometimes been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bell ran hard in his brief appearance last Saturday night and opens the season 
as the starter, which tells you that Green isn't there yet. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Gary is the man Robinson was hoping could win games in the fourth 
quarter with a time-consuming, inside running game. But the first-round pick 
finally agreed to contract terms Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to see the run dominate somebody," Robinson said. "That's my wish 
always. But we're not going to like I would like because we don't get enough 
chances because we're throwing the ball. But I think it's something we always 
have to strive for." 
</P>
<P>
Some league have-nots might dismiss such talk as high-brow nit-picking: Gee, I 
could sure use a third Mercedes for the weekend. Let's face it, the Rams are 
loaded with talent. Their summer pass offense, with quarterback Jim Everett 
directing, was at times devastating, dicing up secondaries with uncommon ease. 
</P>
<P>
"We can move the ball," Robinson said. "When we're clicking, boy, that ball 
goes down the field." 
</P>
<P>
The defense, for so long staid and calculated with trusted veterans, has taken 
on the free-wheeling personality of Kevin Greene, outside linebacker and sack 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary, an interesting mixture of young and old, had 10 interceptions in 
five exhibition games, including five last week against the Detroit Lions. And 
that was without veteran right cornerback LeRoy Irvin, who is out of the lineup 
for three more weeks for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
For Robinson though, youth remains the telling variable. 
</P>
<P>
"We could be 6-10 or 12-4, I really believe that, depending how well we do, and 
what happens injury-wise," he said. "So that's pretty damn exciting, sitting 
with that kind of swing." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have turned over quickly, but are relying on experience in key places 
to get them through the rough spots. Everett gives them stability at 
quarterback. The offensive line features three all-pro performers. And although 
tackles Irv Pankey, 31, and Jackie Slater, 35, are kids no longer, they've 
showed no signs of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Until Irvin was suspended, the Rams had all-pro-caliber players at both with 
Irvin and Jerry Gray. Cliff Hicks steps in until Irvin returns in October. 
</P>
<P>
There's reason for optimism. The Rams won their only NFC West title under 
Robinson in 1985, the year after the 49ers won the Super Bowl. If there's a 
post-title letdown again, the Rams are primed and ready. But the road to the 
top still leads north. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our sense is to win the division, therefore we have to be successful 
against San Francisco," Robinson said. "Now, if something happens to San 
Francisco, we have to be prepared to be successful against New Orleans and 
Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are counting on a quick start out of the blocks. They probably need a 
4-1 start against Atlanta, Indianapolis, Green Bay, San Francisco and Atlanta 
to make a run for the division title. After that, the Rams hit the meat of 
their schedule: Buffalo, New Orleans, Chicago, Minnesota and the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the game of the year should be the home opener Sept. 17, when 
Dickerson returns to Anaheim Stadium with Indianapolis for the first time since 
his trade in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In some places, they'd be camping out to get tickets. In Anaheim, as of this 
week, the Colt game wasn't even a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
After they cleared waivers, quarterback Steve Dils and linebacker Richard Brown 
were re-signed Tuesday by the Rams. Things didn't work out as well for the 
offensive linemen. Eighth-round guard Warren Wheat was claimed by Seattle and 
third-round tackle Kevin Robbins by Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The team also put linebackers Mark Jerue (knee) and Brian Smith (wrist) on 
six-week injured reserve. Smith was a second-round draft choice from Auburn, 
but his progress has been slow. Under new rules, players on injured reserve 
cannot practice with the team for four weeks.

IT JUST CAN'T BE FOREVER FOR EVERT AS GARRISON WINS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chris Evert era in women's tennis officially ended a 19-year run Tuesday, 
far off Broadway in a place appropriately called Queens. 
</P>
<P>
On an unseasonably cool and windy day, Evert played her 113th and final match 
at the U.S. Open. And unlike the first one she played in 1971, she lost. 
</P>
<P>
As a 16-year-old, Evert defeated Eda Budding. Her last match was a straight-set 
quarterfinal defeat at the hands of fifth-seeded Zina Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a long goodby. Evert blew a 5-2 lead in the first set and fell, 7-6 
(7-1), 6-2, in 1 hour 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
On her last match point at the U.S. Open, she stood there at the baseline to 
return serve, shifting her feet together as she always does, then sent a ball 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
She shook her head gently and ran to the net to shake hands with Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," Evert told Garrison. "You played well." 
</P>
<P>
Evert packed her rackets, turned and gave a shy wave to the crowd. As she 
walked off the court with Garrison, they put their arms around one another for 
an instant and hugged. 
</P>
<P>
Evert looked around one last time, then disappeared into a tunnel beneath the 
stands and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the sun has truly set," said Ted Tinling, a historian of tennis for more 
than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a moment that truly represents a passing of an era in women's 
tennis, this was it. But Evert's leave-taking was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of 1,304 matches, 157 tournaments, 18 Grand Slam singles titles and six 
times the U.S. Open champion, Evert has not won a tournament this year and her 
ranking has fallen to an all-time low of No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Evert said she is no longer willing to put in the time to play at the 
level she wished. The outcome of her match against Garrison only reinforced her 
intention to make this year's Open her final major event. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm retiring," Evert said. 
</P>
<P>
Evert turned back the challenge of 15-year-old Monica Seles in a fourth-round 
match two days earlier, but Evert was unable to come back with another such 
match at the same level. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of players that can cause upsets and then, two days later, 
lose to someone ranked 100 in the world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why players like Steffi (Graf) and myself in the past, Martina 
(Navratilova), that's why we have been great, because we have been able to 
never have a letdown in a two-week tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I have had letdowns and that puts me right in with the average 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Evert isn't exactly through playing tennis. She is scheduled to play Federation 
Cup for the United States in Tokyo and she will probably play in a tournament 
in Boca Raton, Fla., next spring. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a series of exhibitions scheduled in various series with 
Navratilova, sort of a Chris Across America tour. 
</P>
<P>
But as far as competing seriously is concerned, Evert says she will never do 
that again. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, who was 15 when she got Evert's autograph at a tournament in Houston, 
felt slightly uncomfortable with her role in Evert's career. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the hardest match I've ever played in my life," Garrison said. "It 
was so emotional. To be the villain, to have to take her out of this tournament 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Garrison has a chance to take out Navratilova. Navratilova, seeded 
second, won her quarterfinal over Manuela Maleeva, 6-0, 6-0, in only 47 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was relieved that she avoided the task of playing Evert one last 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, emotionally, it'll be easier," Navratilova said. "It would have 
been the most emotional match of my life. I could do without it." 
</P>
<P>
After Evert took a commanding early lead, Garrison vowed to run down every ball 
on the court. She took a lead in the tiebreaker when Evert double-faulted and 
was never challenged the rest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
The key game in the second set occurred with Evert serving at 2-2, 30-30. She 
engaged Garrison in a 24-shot rally, the kind of points on which she used to 
excel, but this one ended when she took a short ball and dumped a backhand into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
On break point, Garrison finessed a forehand slice cross-court for a winner and 
a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Evert won only five more points the rest of the way. She was broken to 5-2 when 
Garrison hit a backhand passing shot down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Now Garrison was serving for the match. 
</P>
<P>
Evert held a break point, but Garrison hit another forehand slice winner for 
deuce then set up match point with a deft cross-court backhand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
One serve later, it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew no matter what match I played, win or lose, it would be sad for me 
because my career really started here back when I was 16 years old," Evert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, I think that as I got older, the victories meant more to me because I 
was feeling more." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was not glad it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking that I would be relieved when the tournament was over for me, 
but after you lose a match like today, I'm really not relieved because of what 
I did two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was just starting to play the kind of tennis and I did have high 
hopes for myself." 
</P>
<P>
She sounded sad, wistful, just like a champion accustomed to perfection and 
unable to find it. This was not the way she wanted it to end, but her 
expectations had been raised from the Seles match, so the eventual fall was 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Evert maintained her composure right after the match and in the interview room 
when she met the press. But on the way out, she reached for the arms of her 
husband, Andy Mill, and she cried. 
</P>
<P>
It ended that way and women's tennis may never be the same, as they say. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way, though: The sun might have set, but it was a long and 
marvelous day.

TROJAN DEFENSE WENT INTO THE TANK, SMITH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks, USC Coach Larry Smith has been saying his football team might not be 
as good as everyone thought. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody listened. 
</P>
<P>
Not either of the news services, both of whom picked the Trojans to finish 
among the top five schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Not the national magazines, in which USC was picked anywhere from first to 
sixth in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Not the odds makers, who made the Trojans a 14 1/2-point favorite over Illinois 
in Monday's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Now Smith has their attention. 
</P>
<P>
His premonitions of trouble proved to be more than a case of a coach trying to 
keep his team hyped up. USC, leading 13-0 through three quarters Monday night 
at the Coliseum, lost to Illinois, 14-13, on two fourth-quarter touchdown 
passes by quarterback Jeff George. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense went in the tank," said Smith after reviewing the films. "We 
played well for 3 1/2 quarters and controlled their offense. We had a chance 
for three or four interceptions, a chance for maybe six sacks, but we didn't 
get them. 
</P>
<P>
"But once they scored on that tipped play (a pass from George went through the 
hands of linebacker Scott Ross to receiver Shawn Wax for a 53-yard touchdown 
play), it was like we crashed. We never recovered. Then on that last drive for 
the winning touchdown, we just did not put pressure on them." 
</P>
<P>
While the USC defense stumbled at the end, the offense never got out of the 
starting blocks, but Smith refused to point a finger at his redshirt freshman 
quarterback, Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a whole lot positive about our offense, but our quarterback 
graded over 90% on his performance," Smith said. "(Fullback Leroy) Holt and 
(tailback Ricky) Ervins played pretty well. Other than that, there's not a 
whole lot to shout about. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Illinois has a fine defense, but we didn't even dent them. I was 
shocked and disappointed. They didn't do anything different than we've seen, 
but man for man, they whipped us. There was no movement on our line, no 
sustainment of blocks, not very many creases to run through for the backs. And 
when they had them, the backs didn't run well. They just basically stuffed our 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was Marinovich's failure to balance the offense with deep 
throws. He didn't go long until the final two plays. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coached to take what the defense gives," Smith said of his quarterback. 
"He was so geared into that. We are just going to have to say to him, 'Hey, 
throw deep. The outside people will go catch it.' 
</P>
<P>
"But because we were not controlling the line, the defense was causing us to 
hurry and go to the short stuff. We were calling the deeper stuff, but they 
were taking it away and forcing us to go underneath." 
</P>
<P>
Smith indicated there may well be changes in his starting lineup for the 
Trojans' next game, Sept. 16 against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
His uneasiness with his team began with the two crushing injuries the club 
suffered in camp. At the end of the first week, starting nose guard Don Gibson 
went down with a knee injury that will keep him out at least another four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last week in the final preseason scrimmage, starting quarterback Pat 
O'Hara suffered a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
"That all dulled us," Smith said. "It had a mental effect on the team. You 
could see it in practice. You could see it off the field. You could tell them, 
'Hey, go for broke. Have fun on the football field,' but it just wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
X-rays revealed no break in the dislocated right thumb of tailback Scott 
Lockwood. He suffered the injury returning a punt late in the first quarter and 
never got an opportunity to rush from scrimmage. Lockwood is expected to be out 
about three weeks.

PAUL OLDEN WILL ANNOUNCE UCLA FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radio station KMPC has hired Cleveland Indians announcer Paul Olden to become 
the new voice of UCLA football and basketball, beginning with the basketball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Olden also will serve as the host of the station's weeknight "Sportsline" talk 
show, beginning Monday, Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Olden is replacing Joel Meyers, who left the station to join NBC-TV as a pro 
football announcer. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced earlier that Bob Starr, who does the Ram radio broadcasts, 
will also do UCLA football this season. 
</P>
<P>
Olden has signed a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
Olden, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended Dorsey High School and Los 
Angeles City College, was hired by the Indians before the current baseball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Olden, who attended LACC at the same time as new USC announcer Pete Arbogast, 
may be best known in Los Angeles for a question he asked Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda on May 14, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had just lost to the Chicago Cubs, 10-7, in a 15-inning game in 
which the Cubs' Dave Kingman had three home runs and eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Olden, working as a news assistant at KLAC, asked Lasorda: "What was your 
opinion of Kingman's performance?" 
</P>
<P>
Jim Healy, then at KLAC, used Lasorda's expletive-filled response on his show 
the next day, and has used it many times since.

JOHNSON IS POSITIVE HE'LL DO THE JOB FOR BRUINS 
</P>

UCLA's new starting quarterback is not easily vexed. 
</P>
<P>
Fret? 
</P>
<P>
Not Bret. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Johnson, in fact, brings to Westwood a trait that some say the Bruins have 
not always carried in abundant supply: Self-assurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cockiness? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe that, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not lack for self-confidence," Bruin lineman Scott Spalding said of 
Johnson, his teammate at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro, Johnson was so confident that occasionally he would stand over 
center, stare down the defenders and tell them what was coming next. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guy would be popping off and he'd say, 'We're coming right over you, 
buddy,' " said Spalding, an offensive guard. "And there we'd go. And we'd 
probably get five yards out of it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Shut them right up. 
</P>
<P>
"He's what you want in a quarterback," said Bob Johnson, Bret's father and high 
school coach. "He loves that position and he loves what comes with it -- the 
pressure. He thrives on those all-or-nothing situations. He thrives on Saturday 
night. And he always has." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, to this point, Johnson has thrived on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Named last week to start at quarterback in the Bruins' opener against Tennessee 
Saturday night in the Rose Bowl, Johnson, 19, has yet to take a snap at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Is he concerned that he might not be able to cut it? 
</P>
<P>
Be serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any doubts that I'm going to perform well Saturday night," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Why so sure? 
</P>
<P>
"The position that I play, you've got to be confident," Johnson said. "You 
can't be a second-guesser and hope you'll do something right. You've got to 
feel that you're going to play well." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy served Johnson well at El Toro, where two years ago he was 
named the state's high school player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 188-pound Johnson led El Toro to two consecutive Southern 
Conference championships, passing for 6,538 yards and 63 touchdowns in a 
three-year varsity career. His last-second, 51-yard heave against Santa Ana two 
years ago, giving El Toro a 13-12 victory in the conference semifinals, is 
still one of the most talked-about plays in Orange County prep football 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
Though high school rival Todd Marinovich set an all-time national high school 
passing record, many believed that Johnson was a better prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Milner of Fountain Valley, whose teams played against both 
Marinovich -- now at USC -- and Johnson, called Johnson the best high school 
quarterback he'd ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an unbelievable talent, unbelievable competitor, throws the ball better 
than anyone I've ever seen at the high school level in terms of accuracy, 
velocity, quick feet, quarterback mechanics," said Milner, who is a friend of 
the Johnsons. "I've seen (Vince) Ferragamo and I've seen (Pat) Haden and I've 
even seen (John) Elway. And he compares at the high school level with any of 
those." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made recruiting trips to USC, Penn State and Notre Dame, ultimately 
choosing UCLA over Notre Dame despite his mother's fondness for the campus and 
the atmosphere at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a California kid," Johnson said of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Said his father: "He loves the beach and he loves shorts and thongs and 
shades." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the curly-haired, brown-eyed Johnson also loves competition. 
His teams were 24-0 in games he started in his last two seasons at El Toro. He 
also was an honors student and a two-time All-Southern Section selection as a 
point guard in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite athlete, in fact, is Magic Johnson of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like he just gets the job done," Johnson said of Magic. "He's not too 
concerned about how many points he gets. If he needs to get some rebounds, he 
gets some rebounds. He just wins. I kind of like that about him." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and teammates like that about Bret Johnson, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a ton of charisma and self-confidence and that carries over into the 
huddle," Spalding said. "I think in high school he was viewed as cocky. He's 
not cocky. He's good and he knows it. And when you're around him, you can't 
help but be confident, too." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue announced after spring practice that sophomore Jim 
Bonds had a slight edge over Johnson in their bid to replace Troy Aikman as the 
Bruins' starting quarterback, but Johnson put together a strong fall camp to 
overtake his strong-armed rival from Hart High in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson "improved considerably from where he was in the spring," Donahue said. 
"He's stronger, has gained weight. He's better in the pocket. He's not as 
jittery. He's more comfortable and he has a more complete understanding of the 
offensive system than he did in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has added 18 pounds since last season, when he ran the scout team as a 
redshirt. He beat out Bonds with his consistency in practice, ultimately 
forcing Donahue's hand last Thursday, when he completed seven of nine passes 
for 83 yards and led the offense to a pair of touchdowns in an intra-squad 
scrimmage at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bonds completed only two of seven passes and had three passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
And so, for the first time since 1965, when sophomore Gary Beban started for 
the Bruins in a 13-3 loss against Michigan State, UCLA will open the season 
with a starting quarterback who has never played in a college game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited," Johnson said. "I have a quote up in my room that I've 
kind of saved from about three years ago, when I played in the (Southern 
Section) finals with El Toro. Scott Ross (a former teammate who now plays for 
USC) said about three days before the game that he felt like a 4-year-old 
waiting for Christmas. I can relate to that. I feel like that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Bret fret? 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance.

RULING PUTS DIANE WILLIAMS' MEDAL IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Whether U.S. sprinter Diane Williams will be required to forfeit the bronze 
medal she won in the 1983 world championships at Helsinki because of a rule 
adopted Tuesday by the International Amateur Athletic Federation will not be 
determined until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, which governs track and field, voted to withdraw recognition of 
records, titles and results earned by athletes who subsequently admit use of 
banned substances before those performances. 
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF also established a statute of limitations of six years. Williams 
admitted in a televised interview last February with ABC's Donna de Varona that 
she used drugs while competing for the L.A. Naturite Track Club between 
January, 1982, and March, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has repeated the confession several times, most recently in June 
before a Congressional panel chaired by Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-Del). 
</P>
<P>
Based on her admission, the IAAF has been empowered to recall her bronze medal 
from Helsinki if it determines that the statute of limitations dates back six 
years from the day in February when she first confessed. 
</P>
<P>
But IAAF Vice President Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden said that the IAAF might 
determine that the statute of limitations dates back six years from the day 
when the rule was passed. 
</P>
<P>
The first interpretation would include William's Helsinki performance because 
it would cover the period from February, 1983, to February, 1989. The second 
interpretation, however, would not affect her because it would cover the period 
from Sept. 5, 1983, to Sept. 5, 1989. The 1983 World Championships were held in 
early August. 
</P>
<P>
Ljungqvist said that the IAAF executive council will issue a ruling before Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was raised in Chicago, attended Michigan State. She failed a drug 
test after qualifying for a berth on the U.S. sprint relay team in the 1984 
Olympic trials, but she was not disqualified because of an error in the testing 
period. She did not compete for the sprint relay team at the Summer Olympics 
because of a decision by the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' national championship and second-place finish in the Pan American 
Games in the 100 meters in 1987 will not be affected by the rule because she 
said that she has not used drugs since 1984.

THOUSAND OAKS' BUSHART BACK FROM TOUR TO PROMOTE GOOD-WILL AND HELP SOVIETS' 
FLEDGLING BASEBALL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's with all these weapons we have pointed at the Soviet Union? Billions of 
dollars are spent and, as it turns out, only one arm was needed to defeat the 
Red Army -- the lean left arm of John Bushart. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart, a pitcher from Thousand Oaks, turned back the Red Army baseball team, 
7-3, during a recent two-week barnstorming tour of the Soviet Union, Finland 
and Sweden with a team called the Baseball Ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
The secret? 
</P>
<P>
 Pssst. The Reds can't touch the deuce. 
</P>
<P>
Can't do much with a country fastball, either. It didn't take a KGB defector to 
figure that out after the first couple of days. "They were big and they were 
great athletes, but they had absolutely no baseball skill," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet what the Soviets lack in fundamentals they make up for in curiosity and 
enthusiasm for the U. S. national pastime. "One of their coaches said they like 
the game because it reminds them of chess," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals will come, Soviet officials are certain, as long as American 
teams continue to share the game's nuances in the spirit of glasnost. A stream 
of teams from the United States have toured this summer and a collection of 
minor leaguers, including former Simi Valley High infielder David Milstien, is 
set to go this month. For additional pointers, and for equipment, the Soviets 
turn to their Cuban comrades. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of their gloves were stamped, "Hecho (made) en Cuba," said John Meiers, 
Arcadia High baseball coach and coach of the Ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been playing baseball seriously for three years and their goal 
is to build a team capable of winning an Olympic medal by the turn of the 
century. Baseball has been a demonstration sport in the past two Olympics and 
will make its debut as a medal sport in Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Americans stay champions in this century," Soviet sports specialist 
Irakly Kutateladze told the New York Times two weeks ago. "In the next century, 
we shall see." 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors, who instructed neophyte Soviet players at clinics in 
debris-strewn warehouses on rainy days and weathered questionable cuisine and 
primitive playing facilities, heard the same boast. 
</P>
<P>
" 'We shall see,' " Bushart said, imitating the pet Soviet phrase. "That was 
their low-key way of popping off. We heard that before our game with the Red 
Army. 'You are good players, but we shall see.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets got to see firsthand the array of pitches Bushart, 18, will bring 
to Cal State Northridge next year as a freshman. In 5 2/3 innings against the 
Red Army, he struck out 10 and allowed only two hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
That Aug. 8 victory was the Ambassadors' third in as many games against teams 
from Moscow, first stop on the tour. The team then took a train to Leningrad -- 
defeated the team there, 12-0 -- a bus to Helsinki, Finland, and a cruise ship 
across the Baltic Sea to Stockholm. The only game the Ambassadors lost was a 
5-2 decision to the Swedes the day after the all-night cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the tour was to promote peace and good-will," said Meiers, who 
has compiled a record of 270-96 during 14 seasons as coach at Arcadia. Over the 
past eight years, Meiers has taken Ambassador teams to several European 
countries, China, Japan, Fiji and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I only invite players who are interested in teaching the game to people who 
have little proficiency," he said. "The players have to be talented, so we can 
demonstrate quality baseball, but possessing quality character is foremost." 
</P>
<P>
Bushart, who was recommended to Meiers by Thousand Oaks High Coach Jim Hansen, 
fit the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a left-handed pitcher and I'd heard from scouts that John was real 
good," Meiers said. "His coach assured me that he was the type of person we 
were looking for. John was a class act all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Bushart and his teammates, for example, kept their complaints to a minimum when 
they were served hot dogs, peas and warm cola for breakfast their first morning 
in Moscow. And while their hosts at the People's Friendship University were 
"very friendly, they really worked hard to make our trip the best," according 
to Bushart, daily Soviet life could best be described as drab. 
</P>
<P>
The players stayed five to a room in student dorms at the university. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe students lived in those rooms. They were like jail 
cells," Bushart said. "There was a radio in our room that could get only one 
station. Every morning it came on and the same voice spoke in a monotone. It 
reminded me of Big Brother in (George Orwell's novel) 1984." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, clearly, the Soviets are trying to catch up on the diamond, most of 
which are rough cuts. The nation's first baseball stadium, at Moscow State 
University, is under construction and the Ambassadors played their games on 
soccer and archery fields at state-run Olympic training facilities. Pitcher's 
mounds were nothing more than rubber mats and baselines were drawn with masking 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players were men in their mid-20s who were slightly less than world 
class in another sport. They'd been farmed out to the fledgling baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy ran 10.2 in the 100 meters but was only sixth or seventh best in the 
country, so he was made the center fielder of the Leningrad team," Meiers said. 
"Another guy was a 7-4 high jumper. The third baseman was a world-class javelin 
thrower past his prime. They were athletes, real studs." 
</P>
<P>
And they were humbled by a bunch of American kids just out of high school who 
had grown up with the game. The Ambassadors defeated the People's Friendship 
University team, 18-2, and the Moscow University Aeronautics team, 30-3, before 
beating the Red Army -- the best Soviet team -- and Leningrad. The Ambassadors, 
composed mainly of players from Arcadia and San Marino, hit 13 home runs in the 
first two games. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the outfielders on the Aeronautics team started playing behind the 
fence," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when the Ambassadors began to ease up late in the game, an irate Soviet 
official complained to Meiers. 
</P>
<P>
"From a good-will standpoint we didn't want to embarrass them," the coach said. 
"But they insisted that the game was not interesting if we stopped playing 
hard. They wanted to see double plays, running catches, hard swings, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets obviously considered the spankings administered by the Ambassadors 
a necessary part of learning a complex game. "It blew me away how much they 
know already," Meiers said. "I was unbelievably impressed. Their skills just 
need to catch up with their knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
As baseball fever firms its grip, the government is firming its resolve to 
produce a strong national team. The Soviet Baseball Federation has more than 
tripled to 50 teams and 1,500 players in the three years it has fielded teams. 
This fall, two of the nation's 28 special youth academies for sports prodigies 
will be staffed with baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The players now will never be the Olympians," Meiers noted. "These guys are 
being groomed to be the first crop of coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Alternate sources of baseball knowledge are available. A pitcher in Leningrad 
asked Bushart to help him develop a forkball and the Ambassador obliged. It 
wasn't the Soviet's first trick pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw me a knuckleball and it dropped off the table," Bushart recalled. "I 
asked him where he learned it and he said from reading Jim Bouton's book, 'Ball 
Four.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sharing culture came as easily as exchanging pitching tips. Bushart handed out 
a shoe box full of baseball cards to opposing players and had ample opportunity 
to barter off the field as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Black market traders who spoke English sort of forced their way into our 
rooms," he said. "They didn't seem trustworthy; we were kind of scared." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bushart exchanged T-shirts and a pair of old shorts for an 
authentic soldier's cap, a Soviet flag, a fur hat and assorted souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
But the memory of defeating the Red Army team will endure longer than any 
memento. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two games we had no intensity, but for the Red Army game we were 
amped. We came out like it was a championship game," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, he struck out the leadoff batter, got the next on a 
comebacker and struck out the No. 3 batter, an enormous man with a thick beard. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the most hellacious cut I've ever seen on strike three, a curve down 
and in," Bushart said. "I K'd him three times." 
</P>
<P>
 Psssst. The Reds can't touch the deuce.

SURGERY SIDELINES CHRIS PEERY;

CANYON TAILBACK OUT INDEFINITELY

<P>
Canyon High tailback Chris Peery underwent emergency urological surgery Tuesday 
night and will miss at least the first month of the season, according to Coach 
Harry Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Peery (6-foot-1, 210 pounds), who rushed for 1,418 yards and 22 touchdowns as a 
junior last season, was recovering at Valley Presbyterian Hospital on Tuesday 
evening after undergoing surgery for a non-football injury in the groin area, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. Peery was hospitalized Tuesday afternoon after 
complaining of pain since early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He woke up at three in the morning in intense pain," Welch said. "He rested 
all day Saturday. He came to school today to register and was worse." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said that Peery will be lost for "a minimum of a month," possibly the 
entire season. "I don't know," he said. "Obviously, we're in shock."

SIZE OF ROSTER AT OAK PARK IN QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the high school football season started today, Oak Park High would not be 
able to field a team, according to Coach Ron Veres. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles have only eight healthy and eligible players on their roster, 
according to Veres, and have three days to rectify the situation. They are 
scheduled to open the season Friday at home against Boron. 
</P>
<P>
Veres' contention is news to school Athletic Director Fred Yamano. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unaware that there is a problem," Yamano said. "According to the roster I 
have, there should be 19 players. I've only received one accident report." 
</P>
<P>
If Oak Park can't suit up at least 11 players, it will be forced to forfeit its 
first game, and possibly the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible. It's a terrible situation," Veres said. "We're trying to be 
positive to maintain team morale. We'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Veres, who is a walk-on coach, and his seven-man staff were scheduled to meet 
with Yamano on Tuesday afternoon, but Veres was late leaving his teaching 
position at Simi Valley High so the meeting was postponed a day. 
</P>
<P>
Veres said that he has talked to school administrators about the problem since 
the first day of practice. Only 12 eligible players showed up when practice 
began Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The roster had increased to 19, but one player was declared academically 
ineligible and 10 others suffered an assortment of minor injuries, Veres said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Eagles suited up 14 players in a 24-0 loss to Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Veres could try to coax the remaining six sophomores on the junior varsity team 
who are eligible to play varsity football, eliminate the JV team and form a 
freshman team with the remaining 21 JV players.

YOUNG TROUPERS OF 'TOSCA' READY FOR A NIGHT TO REMEMBER

For the 16 youngsters who will appear in "Tosca," opening tonight at the Music 
Center, it will be just another night at the opera. The 8-to-12-year-olds will 
be dressed up and wearing makeup, but for a different reason: as seasoned 
performers trained by the Los Angeles Children's Choir and Polytechnic School 
in Pasadena. They've appeared in past Music Center Opera productions such as 
"Otello" and "Wozzeck." 
</P>
<P>
"Tosca," written by Puccini 90 years ago, is tragic opera with all the R-rated 
ingredients of love, betrayal, murder and suicide. But these kids will be home 
and safe in bed by the time the action in Act III begins. The children's choir 
appears early in the first act, and they are sent home 30 minutes after the 
curtain rises. 
</P>
<P>
They know the full story line of intrigue and violence, but they say they are 
unaffected because they know the opera is all an act. "It doesn't bother me 
because it's fake and I know it isn't real," explained 11-year-old Daniel 
Mauer, who attends Polytechnic. 
</P>
<P>
"And with the killing and stuff, we are never in any part when something bad is 
happening. We are in the happy part," Daniel said. When asked if he would 
rather be in the "bad part," he said, "I kind of like it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
The young performers -- either members of the Los Angeles Children's Choir, 
based in Pasadena, or students at Polytechnic -- are being paid $4.25 an hour 
for rehearsals and $15 per show. "They are chosen because they have 
experience," said Rebecca Thompson, who is director of the four-year-old LACC 
and a music teacher at Polytechnic. The youngsters, who will sing in Italian, 
have been working with Placido Domingo, who conducts the new production, and 
director Ian Judge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first opera, and I like it because we are not in straight lines. We 
get to act like kids, run around and get on people's shoulders and have pillow 
fights," said 10-year-old Nathan Nouskajian, who also attends Polytechnic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having performed on stage numerous times, they still suffer from some 
nervousness. "Sometimes I just try to believe that the audience is not there 
and go on with my act as if it was a rehearsal," said Allegra Echeverria, 8. 
But for Sarah Harkins, 11, there is no time to be nervous: "Usually you are too 
busy thinking about the pitch. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Patrick Dougall said: "I get more nervous doing things in front 
of kids than adults because usually kids talk more openly about it than adults 
will." 
</P>
<P>
"Usually there's this one part that you are always scared of messing up," said 
10-year-old Clayton Woodhall. "For me it is getting Nathan up on my shoulders 
and I am scared of us falling, but it has not happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
Falling flat in showbiz is something they've already learned to think about, 
but they still retain aspirations to become performers or actors when they get 
older. "As for growing up and being an actor, I would like to be in shows but 
would not want to make a career out of it because it's too risky," Daniel said. 
"You may not always be in a show, and you won't survive very well without any 
money." 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be in a couple of shows, but I don't think I would make a 
career out of it," said Nathan. "Some people are really rich from it but some 
just don't make it."

HAIG TO NARRATE COMIC 'ANIMALS' AT LEISURE VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even Alexander M. Haig Jr. is amused by the incongruity of this one. 
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state, a man who helped orchestrate the Vietnam War and 
once described himself as "just an old warrior," will appear at the Leisure 
Village Ocean Hills Music Festival in Oceanside this weekend to narrate 
Saint-Saens' comic "Carnival of the Animals." 
</P>
<P>
When reminded during a telephone interview from his Washington office that 
classical music didn't quite fit his hard-edged resume, Haig let out with a 
barking laugh: "Why, for a man of violence, you mean? Well, I guess you're 
right, it's not the usual thing I do." 
</P>
<P>
Self-irony aside, he is accustomed to a different stage, on a different scale. 
Through much of his career -- as a four-star general and later in the Reagan 
Administration as secretary of state -- Haig has played to a global audience on 
more weighty issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Haig, who now claims to be divorced from politics following his failed 
presidential bid last year, said his festival appearance actually makes some 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
His interest in classical music, especially piano pieces, began when, as a boy, 
he enjoyed listening to both his parents play. His mother was an accomplished 
pianist, as was his father, a musician good enough to give concerts. And Haig 
met his wife, Phyllis, following a piano recital she gave in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say that it's in my blood. With all of that classical music around 
you for so long, you have to develop a keen appreciation and have a natural 
leaning that way." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's his involvement with Leisure Village, an affluent senior citizens 
community in lush North San Diego County. Haig, a member of the board of 
directors since 1983, was asked by Leisure Village's developer, Michael L. 
Tenzer, to distinguish the festival by adding his name to the program. "This 
will be a valuable cultural event but, and we make no bones about it, this has 
a marketing objective as well as a cultural objective," Haig conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he was deliberate in emphasizing the event's quality. Under Henri 
Temianka's direction, the festival will begin Friday in Maurice Abravanel Hall 
with two chamber music ensemble concerts by the California Chamber Virtuosi, 
including three movements from Stravinsky's "Petrushka" and Mendelssohn's Trio 
in D minor, Opus 49. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening, Yehuda Gilad will direct the Strawberry Creek Music Festival 
Orchestra in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito Overture" and Schubert's Third 
Symphony. Earlier in the day, Steven Mayer will give a piano recital of Brahms' 
Sonata in F minor, Mozart's Sonata in F and a selection of Fats Waller songs, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning will begin with a panel discussion on contemporary classical 
music that will include Temianka, violinist Sergiu Schwartz, Mayer and Maurice 
Abravanel. 
</P>
<P>
The final Sunday offering will be "Carnival of the Animals," performed by the 
California Chamber Virtuosi under Temianka's direction. Haig will read Ogden 
Nash's wry verse accompanying this piece comprised of 14 "musical pictures of 
animals" for two pianos, string quintet, flute, clarinet and percussion. Before 
that, Schubert's "Trout" Quintet will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
In such a pristine setting, there would seem no room for controversy. But as 
controversy often found Haig in public life, it has surfaced in Oceanside. The 
Times reported in August that Leisure Village's sprawling golf course and part 
of its lavish clubhouse were financed with a $27-million loan insured by the 
San Diego office of the scandal-torn U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials are concerned because Leisure Village, a private, gated 
community, does not provide benefits for the poor. The loan was approved by HUD 
in 1981, two years before Haig became involved with Leisure Village. 
</P>
<P>
Haig said he was "surprised" by The Times' report and did not know enough about 
the specifics of the case to comment. He was concerned, however, that it might 
cast a shadow on the festival, which he hopes will be judged on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
As for his own performance, Haig conceded, a bit sheepishly, that he wasn't 
quite sure how to prepare. His wife will join him on stage, so he plans to 
rehearse the Nash sketches with her. He admires the piece, both for Nash's 
witty writing and Saint-Saens' music -- the piece has been described as the 
composer's most brilliant parody, teasing Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn and 
Rossini -- but he admitted he's a little at sea. 
</P>
<P>
To keep on course, Haig said he'll try to rely on any actorly skills he's 
gained during more than 20 years in public office. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two models, you know -- those that start in acting and go into 
politics and those that, after a bit of politics, go into acting," he said with 
a laugh. "I won't mention any names, but there's a guy out here in California 
that fits the former pretty well. I fit the latter, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my stint in office. I did my bit and loved it, but that part is over. In 
1992 I see myself (campaigning) for Bush, but that's about all I see."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'DAYS OF RAGE' DESERVES ALL THE ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rarely has a television program been as bitterly savaged before it aired. Yet 
rarely has there been a program with a topic as volatile as this one. 
</P>
<P>
The rage directed at Jo Franklin-Trout and her heavily tilted, but 
still-valuable and intensely powerful documentary about the Palestinian 
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has almost obscured 
the program itself. 
</P>
<P>
That should end tonight when, at last, after delays and months of fiery 
controversy, "Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians" is presented to the nation. 
It arrives on PBS as the hot-potato centerpiece of a 2 1/2-hour spread (at 9 
p.m. on Channels 28, 15 and 24) titled "Intifada: The Palestinians and Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Framing the Palestinian-favoring "Days of Rage" are separately produced taped 
pieces tilted toward Israel, the last of which is followed by a useful 
40-minute panel discussion examining Franklin-Trout's program and the issues it 
raises -- and doesn't raise. Costing almost as much as the 90-minute "Days of 
Rage," these appendages appear to have been added as a sort of spin control, at 
least in partial response to enormous advance criticism of the program from 
mostly Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism has swelled into a crusade to discredit both Franklin-Trout and 
her program, at times approaching an ugly smear campaign. The lobbyists have 
ranged from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith (calling the program 
"factual manipulations") to the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles, which phoned 
at least one TV critic with an offer to send him material critical of "Days of 
Rage." 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Days of Rage" is important and -- despite what its harshest critics say -- 
very much deserves this TV stage. 
</P>
<P>
It offers faces you seldom see in closeup, and sounds you seldom hear. A 
Palestinian girl: "I am 7 years old. My father was killed in front of my house 
during the month of Ramadan." 
</P>
<P>
It offers fresh voices, mostly from Palestinians usually omitted from the 
slender sound bites of American TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Days of Rage" is never more shocking than when chronicling the wretched 
squalor and hopelessness in camps inhabited by many Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. Or more indicting than when touring the rubble of a 
Palestinian villager's house that was demolished as part of Israel's 
controversial policy of collective punishment. Or more appalling than when 
showing the terrible back wounds of a young boy said to have been beaten by 
Israeli soldiers. Or more moving than when a schoolgirl says what she hopes to 
gain from the intifada, the Arabic word for uprising: "an identity." Or more 
fascinating than when letting Palestinians explain their strategies for the 
intifada. 
</P>
<P>
Her purpose, Franklin-Trout states tonight, is to show "who they (the young 
Palestinians) are, what they are, what they want and how they intend to get it, 
and what end for the crisis now seems possible." Bravo to that. 
</P>
<P>
But not to all of "Days of Rage," which, unfortunately, is not only a trial of 
Israeli policy in the occupied territories, but also one in which, almost 
always, only the prosecution's case is presented. 
</P>
<P>
Documentaries with strong points of view only strengthen a society that 
purports to cherish freedom of expression. Moreover, some of the charges here 
are echoed by some human rights groups. Michael H. Posner, executive director 
of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, says in "Days of Rage": 
</P>
<P>
"From a human rights point of view, there are some particularly disturbing 
problems (in) the use of live ammunition (and) the ongoing practice of beatings 
(by Israeli troops), which seem excessive in some situations." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the charges are so strong that granting Israelis the opportunity to 
respond, at least generically, should have been a given, a sliver of fairness 
that "Days of Rage" could have accommodated without softening its case. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, "Days of Rage" is a succession of horror stories from 
Palestinians accusing Israelis of heinous acts in trying to put down the 
intifada. Typical: "They burst into our house, the occupation army. They beat 
my father, my mother, my sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin-Trout, who is also the reporter and narrator for her program, is an 
excellent documentary storyteller. What "Days of Rage" lacks most, however, is 
context. 
</P>
<P>
Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Israel gained statehood, the Arabs "were enraged" and "war broke out," 
says Franklin-Trout, making "war" sound as blameless as a case of measles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also omitted in Franklin-Trout's shorthand history is any mention of 
Palestinians also being victimized by Jordan and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Palestinian relief worker finds Israelis "obsessed by security," as if 
there is no history of Arab terrorism directed against Jews. And on this 
program, moreover, there isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We hear about the Palestinian Liberation Organization's "alleged dark and 
bloody history," the "alleged" being a softening word excluded from charges 
against Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outside a facility where Palestinians are held by Israelis for months 
without being charged, Franklin-Trout hears stories of abuse from Palestinians. 
"They would put him in jail, a small kid?" she asks, incredulously. Small kids 
are casualties of the intifada. You wish that just once, however, 
Franklin-Trout would play devil's advocate and ask Palestinians about 
provocation, as with the man who tells her that Israeli soldiers shoot 
Palestinians "for simply walking in the street." 
</P>
<P>
The shorter taped pieces that precede and follow "Days of Rage" were prepared 
by New York's WNET-TV, the PBS "presenting" station for "Intifada: The 
Palestinians and Israel." Mostly, they are an Israeli's-eye-view that attempts 
to justify Israeli policies and actions in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Also produced by WNET, and ably and fairly moderated by Hodding Carter, the 
panel discussion is a spirited debate whose participants are Alan L. Keyes, an 
assistant secretary of State and ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social 
Council in the Reagan Administration; Seymour D. Reich, international president 
of B'nai B'rith; Richard W. Murphy, who was assistant secretary of State for 
Near East and East Asian Affairs from 1983 until recently; Jerusalem Post 
correspondent Walter Ruby, and James J. Zogby, executive director of the Arab 
American Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the acrimony surrounding "Days of Rage" is sure to linger. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Washington, Franklin-Trout dismissed an article to appear in the 
Sept. 18 edition of The New Republic as the "final salvo" in the offensive to 
undercut her program. Written by Steven Emerson, a senior editor at U.S. News 
&amp; World Report, the article charges that "Days of Rage" was made "in close 
cooperation" with the Arab American Cultural Foundation, on whose board 
Franklin-Trout sits. 
</P>
<P>
Denying the charge, Franklin-Trout said that she joined the foundation's board 
"a year after I finished the film." She also rejected the article's assertion 
that she had sold the foundation rights for her program's "international 
distributuion and national distribution after it had been aired by PBS." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin-Trout has said she financed "Days of Rage" entirely from sales of 
cassettes of her previous documentaries to various organizations, including the 
foundation. PBS has confirmed that it rejected Franklin-Trout's suggestion to 
include the names of those organizations in the "Days of Rage" credits because 
such a listing would have gone against PBS policy. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more injurious to "Days of Rage" was last month's public criticism 
of the program by Posner of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "I've 
disassociated myself from it," said Posner, who added that he stood by his 
comments made to Franklin-Trout in "Days of Rage," but faulted the program for 
being "highly simplistic" and excluding "present Israeli mainstream views." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin-Trout labeled Posner's criticism "disingenuous." It's a word that 
somehow fits much of the controversy shrouding "Days of Rage."

MORNING REPORT: 'BUCK' STILL NO. 1 AFTER QUIET LABOR DAY

Labor Day weekend -- summer's final box-office fling -- did not build up much 
steam as ticket sales continued their gradual downward swing, with the Top 10 
films falling an average of almost 13%. With no major studio releases, 
Universal led the way for the third week in a row with its family duo of "Uncle 
Buck" ($7.8 million) and "Parenthood" ($7.5 million). Miramax's "sex, lies and 
videotape" expanded from 94 to 347 screens and jumped to No. 8, grossing $3.4 
million for a per-screen average of $9,847. The summer films will be challenged 
when the first of the fall offerings arrive Friday with Universal's "Sea of 
Love" starring Al Pacino and Warner Bros.' "In Country," directed by Norman 
Jewison and co-starring Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
* Paramount's "Shirley Valentine" -- despite being a hard-to-market English 
film starring an unknown actress -- opened smashingly on only eight screens for 
$245,422. Although it received mixed reviews, the comedy starring Pauline 
Collins, who created the part on stage, grossed $30,678 per screen.

STATE PANEL OPENS 2ND INVESTIGATION OF TOP CAMPBELL AIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether the top aide 
to state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) improperly disclosed a 
$20,000 loan -- apparently made at a below-market interest rate -- from a City 
of Industry firm that has been a political contributor to his boss. 
</P>
<P>
The state political watchdog agency investigation of Campbell aide Jerome M. 
Haleva comes less than a month after The Times disclosed that Haleva intervened 
on behalf of the firm, United Packaging Corp., with state contract officials 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue was raised, and we will review something if it appears to merit 
review," commission spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Tuesday in confirming the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva placed a telephone call to John S. Babich, deputy director of the state 
Office of Procurement, in June, 1988, as United Packaging faced 
disqualification on a highly competitive $1.6-million contract to supply 
garbage bags to state agencies, public records show. United Packaging was the 
lowest bidder, but it would have been unable to provide the bags within six 
weeks of each order, as contract officials had specified. 
</P>
<P>
After the call, procurement officials rewrote the bid specifications to allow 
for a 12-week delivery time, and United Packaging won the state's business, 
public records show. 
</P>
<P>
The call from Haleva came 16 months after the company and its president, Frank 
Eugene Raper, had given Haleva a $20,000 loan at 8% interest -- 2% to 3% lower 
than what banks were offering the general public at the time. The loan, secured 
by a second trust deed against Haleva's home, was granted in February, 1987, 
and was either repaid or forgiven in early June, 1987, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discount on a loan is generally considered a gift that therefore would 
be required to be disclosed on the yearly statements of economic interest 
required of politicians and their staff members. Haleva did disclose the loan 
in 1987, but he did not report having received a benefit in the below-market 
interest rate, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussing specifics, commission spokeswoman Michioku said the agency 
has the authority to investigate the possibility of a conflict of interest and 
failure to disclose financial dealings by legislative staff members such as 
Haleva. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku also said the loan inquiry is the second FPPC one to involve Haleva, 
whose annual salary is more than $90,000 and who is widely known for his 
political acumen. 
</P>
<P>
The first investigation, which is continuing, began earlier this summer after 
newspaper reports disclosed that both Haleva and Campbell had failed to report 
receiving free use of a car and driver during the Republican National 
Convention in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The car, a Lincoln Continental, was provided by Asbestos Environmental 
Controls, a New Orleans firm that had sought Haleva's help when it encountered 
difficulties on a state contract last year. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had donated $27,000 to Campbell campaign funds during 1987 and 1988. 
It faced disqualification as an asbestos consulting firm because it had failed 
to properly submit certification papers to state officials. Haleva called the 
state architect's office and got a delay that allowed the company to file its 
certification and therefore retain more than $800,000 in state business. 
</P>
<P>
After the newspaper articles on the matter appeared, Haleva and Campbell 
amended their disclosure forms to report receiving $761 in "transportation" 
from the company. 
</P>
<P>
State records show that Raper has contributed $3,500 to Campbell since 1985 and 
that United Packaging gave Campbell a $100,000 campaign loan in October, 1986. 
The loan was made on Oct. 7 and repaid two weeks later with $349 in interest, 
documents show.

YORBA LINDA MOVES TO DECLARE NIXON HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yorba Linda, which once fought to be designated as the official birthplace of 
former President Richard M. Nixon, now wants to declare his birthday a city 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"President Nixon is definitely in fashion again," declared Yorba Linda Mayor 
Henry W. Wedaa, who proposed the Jan. 9 holiday for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night to request a resolution designating 
the holiday. In two weeks, the council will decide whether to create a new 
holiday or substitute Nixon's birthday for an existing city holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a fine idea," said Councilman Mark Schwing. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels, Wedaa said, he finds that people rarely bring up the Watergate 
scandal that forced Nixon's resignation in 1974. Rather, people often recognize 
Yorba Linda as Nixon's birthplace and the home of the Richard M. Nixon 
Presidential Library, which is scheduled to be completed next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This often leads to many positive comments about what a great president 
history is showing him to be," Wedaa said, adding that he hopes that the Nixon 
Library will schedule special events to coincide with the new Nixon holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda has aggressively staked out its Nixon turf, but the road hasn't 
always been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Yorba Linda and Whittier, where Nixon grew up, argued over 
which city could claim him as a native son. It was agreed that Yorba Linda 
would be Nixon's birthplace, and Whittier would be Nixon's hometown.

THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN RETURN TO CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiggling and vibrating like a tiny engine, 6-year-old Jessica Brunner was a 
giddy mix of excitement and jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
With hardly a wink of sleep the night before to calm her, Jessica could hardly 
sit still in the back seat of her family's van. She scissored the air with her 
legs and clutched her bright yellow lunch box, hoping for the best on a big day 
-- her first day of first grade. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can think about is school!" Jessica said, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica had chattered happily most of the morning as she put on her new 
blue-and-white striped outfit, gathered her school supplies and let her mom tie 
a pink lace ribbon into her long, blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smile Faded Suddenly 
</P>
<P>
But as the Fountain Valley youngster joined her class on the playground of 
James H. Cox Elementary School, her smile faded and she fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
The brown-eyed girl clung to the hands of her mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
Her grave expression vanished within seconds, however, as friends rushed up to 
greet her. Jessica's mother, Jo Brunner, watched with a smile as the girls 
oohed and aahed over new clothes and haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene repeated over and over Tuesday, as thousands of county children 
surrendered their summer vacations and returned to school. Many more will start 
class in coming days. Although some were reluctant to trade swimsuits for 
schoolbooks, they were also eager to see old friends, make new ones and face 
the challenges of a new grade. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's first thought Tuesday morning was: "School!" She was especially 
excited that she is getting her own desk and chair this year, the floor-sitting 
of kindergarten behind her. 
</P>
<P>
She and 29 classmates got right to work with their new pencils and crayons, 
writing their names and drawing pictures of themselves in yellow workbooks. 
When their teacher, Ruth Ann Stark, asked what they would like to learn this 
year, they called out: Science! Math! Reading! Animals! Insects! Planets! 
Dinosaurs! Nature! The Civil War! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote Story to Take Home 
</P>
<P>
Between recesses outside, the children worked diligently, memorizing a short 
poem, "September Morning," and writing a little story to take home to their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
As she waited for her mother to pick her up in the afternoon, Jessica declared 
her first day of school a success. "It was neat," she said, her hair a little 
windblown from playing outside. 
</P>
<P>
The lazy pace of summer had picked up dramatically in the last few weeks as 
back-to-school fever gripped parents, students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
While the campuses were still quiet, teachers filed back into their classrooms 
and flung themselves into a cutting-and-pasting frenzy, transforming bare walls 
into a cozy, colorful home away from home. 
</P>
<P>
A warm, soft-spoken woman with a blond pageboy hair style, Stark recruited her 
own two youngsters to help her pin up bright new calendars and cartoon figures 
on bulletin boards and to cut out huge paper leaves in autumn colors. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk into a room that is completely devoid of anything," she said a few days 
before school started. "There's only furniture and filing cabinets. There's a 
lot to do to make this room feel warm and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Her preparations did not end there. She got her own sixth-grader and 
eighth-grader ready for school. She squeezed in a few shopping expeditions to 
"spruce up" her own wardrobe. And night after night, she made detailed outlines 
of her lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
Stark, 42 and beginning her 19th teaching season, said she shares her students' 
mixed feelings about returning to school. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always exciting new little faces to see," she said. "They're so 
lovely and so anxious to come to school. I kind of hate to see my summer end, 
but it's inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
In the waning days of summer, enthusiastic youngsters dragged their parents up 
and down store aisles, filling shopping carts with school necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Powell, 6, of El Toro, a first-grader at La Madera Elementary School, 
assembled a new set of colored pencils and markers. Eager to try buying lunch 
at school, Tyler hoped that the cafeteria would have nachos, one of his 
favorite foods. 
</P>
<P>
Each night, Tyler had been practicing his alphabet, carefully drawing the 
letters on big sheets of white paper. First grade is exciting because, he said: 
"You stay there longer. It's more grown up." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ford, 6, who started first grade at Roch Courreges Elementary School in 
Fountain Valley, pushed a cart through the local Target store with his mom the 
week before school. 
</P>
<P>
He picked a Trapper Keeper -- an all-in-one notebook and folder with pockets -- 
decorated with colorful hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza slices. He stacked up 
scissors, glue, washable markers. Darting in and out of the dressing rooms in 
Robinson's, he picked shorts, pants and T-shirts for school. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Belmonte, 6, readied himself for school by practicing his math -- he 
can already add two-digit numbers -- and spelling his last name out loud, over 
and over. On Friday afternoon, he positioned himself in the office of Fountain 
Valley Elementary School so he could learn who his teacher and classmates were 
as soon as the list was posted. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Brunner prowled a Target store in search of the perfect backpack. She 
picked a sky-blue model, trimmed with pink hearts. Just as a grown-up kicks the 
tires of a used car, she scrutinized her choice, probing every compartment, 
zipping every zipper. Satisfied, she swung the paper-stuffed backpack onto her 
back and wore it for the rest of the shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a crucial selection: the all-important lunch box. Again, she was the 
careful shopper, testing the lock of each brightly colored plastic box, opening 
it and examining the design on the thermos. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanna make sure I like this," she said. "I'm gonna see it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Declining to put her chosen box into the shopping cart, she toted it up and 
down the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, she listed the ways first grade differs from kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
"You get out later. You don't get to play outside as much," she said. Prompted 
by her sister, Janelle, 9, she added: "Oh, yeah, you eat lunch there." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was "a little" excited and nervous about her first day, but added, 
"It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, however, she squealed, "Only five more days until school! I 
can't wait!" 
</P>
<P>
For most children, the excitement of the new school year is mixed with sadness 
that another summer has come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have a little more time on vacation," Patrick Ford said. "I wish I 
never had to go to school. I wish I knew everything myself." 
</P>
<P>
But he faced the new year on an upbeat, helpful note: "I think the first day 
will be fun," he said. "I hardly ever cry on the first day of school. I see 
other kids crying because they don't want to leave their mom. When I see that, 
I try to play with them to cheer them up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

3 SUSPECTS IN PARKING LOT ROBBERIES ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim police have arrested three suspects in connection with armed robberies 
in parking lots along Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Sidney DuBois, 24, a transient; William Marvin Bailey, 21, of 
Los Angeles; and Audraca Coleman, 31, of Anaheim. The three are suspected of 
robbing two men and a woman at about 9:20 p.m. Monday at an auto dealership at 
16742 Beach Blvd. The suspects pulled up in a red vehicle, pointed two guns -- 
possibly a handgun and automatic weapon -- and demanded their money, said 
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Ed McErlain. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, two men and a woman in the parking lot of a restaurant 
at 16160 Beach Blvd. reported a similar robbery. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the second holdup, a Huntington Beach police officer 
returning home from work spotted a red vehicle in Buena Park with three people 
matching the descriptions of the robbers. The officer called for local police, 
and Fullerton, Anaheim and Buena Park officers chased the suspects until they 
were caught at the intersection of Northgate Lane and Citron Street in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
All three are being held in Huntington Beach Jail.

LAW BLOCKING DEVELOPMENT ON SAN JUAN HILLSIDE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Echoing a growing sentiment for preserving South County's shrinking natural 
landscape, the San Juan Capistrano City Council on Tuesday night tentatively 
approved a new city law aimed at protecting hills and ridgelines from future 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The ridgeline preservation law, passed unanimously by the five-member council, 
makes it illegal to build on 3,000 acres of steep hilltops and ridges that wind 
through the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is tightening up or making stronger the (longtime city) 
policy that you shouldn't develop on ridgelines," Councilman Anthony L. Bland 
said before the council vote. "I support this measure." 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of the ordinance, which bars construction within 200 feet of a 
ridgeline's peak, is expected at the council's Sept. 19 meeting. But it may be 
challenged in court by one local developer, who has accused city officials of 
breaking a 10-year-old development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which includes an exemption process, replaces a temporary 
measure that was passed July 18. 
</P>
<P>
That emergency ordinance was adopted to prevent a flood of last-minute 
development applications while city staff drafted the permanent statute, Mayor 
Gary L. Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ordinance is the first to block development on ridgelines, 
Hausdorfer said that since 1974, the city's hills and ridges have been marked 
for preservation by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, San Juan Capistrano officials prevented the destruction of 
ridgelines by rejecting hillside development projects as they were submitted to 
the city, the mayor said. However, City Atty. John R. Shaw recommended that the 
ordinance be drafted to ensure that the ridgelines remain untouched for years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
The city's General Plan, a document outlining development goals for the city, 
says, "It is of prime importance to the city to preserve ridgelines." But there 
was no law to back the preservation philosophy, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make the policy of the General Plan clear," City Manager Stephen B. 
Julian said. "This ordinance does that." 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer agreed that a law banning ridgeline development was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"This strengthens our own resolve to preserve ridgelines," Julian said. "It 
simply is a more formal way, a more prudent way, of implementing the wishes of 
San Juan Capistrano citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was opposed by local developer Robert Maurer, who said that he 
has planned to build a million-dollar estate on top of a ridgeline that cuts 
through property he owns. The home, located on a one-third-acre parcel, would 
offer a 360-degree view. 
</P>
<P>
Maurer's attorney, Roger A. Grable, said after the council vote that city 
officials were aware of his client's intentions to build the estate as part of 
an agreement reached in 1979. That agreement allowed Maurer's company, Coral 
Properties, to build 63 homes on a lower portion of his land. 
</P>
<P>
Grable said the ordinance will cause his client undue financial hardship, 
adding that he will seek an exemption to the ordinance before its final 
passage. If that waiver is not granted, Grable said, he will file a lawsuit to 
recoup money Maurer expects to lose by not building the estate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work out a compromise," Grable said. "We don't want to have to 
go that route (to court). But unfortunately, it looks like we may have to." 
</P>
<P>
An exemption could be granted if the development does not change the appearance 
of the ridgeline and is compatible with all other zoning laws. However, City 
Atty. Shaw said the proposed estate would not fall under the criteria of the 
exemption clause. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw told the council that he does not believe the city is violating any 
agreement Maurer made with the city, adding that he does not believe Maurer 
will suffer economically. 
</P>
<P>
Community Planning Director Thomas G. Merrell said in a staff report that 
public concerns over "urbanization of southeast Orange County" outweigh private 
interests in preserving the rural skyline. 
</P>
<P>
With large-scale development occurring in unincorporated areas to the north of 
the city, Merrell wrote, slow-growth measures such as the ridgeline 
preservation ordinance will ensure "a separate physical identity for the city 
and prevent it from becoming a continuous part of adjacent urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle in Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at our (undeveloped) ridgelines," Hausdorfer said before the council 
vote. "You can tell where Capistrano ends and Laguna Niguel begins. The 
ridgelines are a sacred thing to the citizens of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"Without that (longtime) commitment, San Juan Capistrano would not have those 
ridgelines preserved today." 
</P>
<P>
The city's push to preserve ridgelines comes at a time when officials in 
neighboring Laguna Beach are struggling to halt the destruction of that city's 
rural system of canyons, ridges and rocky hilltops through what they called an 
Open Space Program. 
</P>
<P>
Under that plan, Laguna Beach officials have begun buying private property in 
Laguna Canyon as a way to form a permanent natural barrier between the 
62-year-old beach community and developments in Laguna Niguel and Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the council has reopened negotiations with John E. DeWitt to buy 
195 acres of land he owns on Laguna Canyon Road near El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
The council was considering using the power of eminent domain to acquire the 
land, but backed down at the urging of the city's Open Space Commission, which 
recommended that city officials use land-taking powers only as "a last resort."

NANCY REAGAN OPENS WOMEN'S CONFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TALK FOCUSES ON ANTI-DRUG DRIVE, WHITE HOUSE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE and LILY ENG, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan opened the annual Southern California Conference 
on Women on Tuesday with a half-hour talk that highlighted her anti-drug 
campaign and her tumultuous eight years in the White House as "wife of the most 
powerful man on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Anaheim conference had barred the media from covering the 
first day of events, including Mrs. Reagan's speech, citing security reasons 
and the former First Lady's wishes to keep reporters out. However, Mark 
Weinberg, a spokesman for Nancy Reagan, disputed that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole organization (sponsoring the conference) is not desirous of 
the press. Mrs. Reagan had no objections whatsoever," Weinberg told several 
reporters who simply paid the $35 conference fee and observed Mrs. Reagan's 
talk with 3,500 others. 
</P>
<P>
Chief conference organizer Karen L. Smith, approached after the talk, declined 
to comment on the barring of the media. 
</P>
<P>
The annual conference has been bathed in controversy recently because its 
original sponsor, state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), paid about 
$200,000 in fees to his wife, Margene, and conference organizer Smith, who is 
his Orange County field coordinator. Campbell has disassociated himself from 
the conference, although Smith is still its primary organizer. Feminists had, 
in the past, protested the conference, charging that Campbell has frequently 
voted against women's issues in the Legislature. Campbell is a staunch opponent 
of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But the former First Lady's talk Tuesday was anything but controversial. 
Basically, she covered the same material she had mentioned in several 
post-White House interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Peppered with self-deprecating humor and references to "Ronnie," Mrs. Reagan 
talked about the "highs" and "lows" of her eight-year stint in the nation's 
capital, from the bad publicity she received over replacing the White House 
china to the media scrutiny her husband's surgeries attracted. 
</P>
<P>
Those years, she said, "probably changed me forever." 
</P>
<P>
A First Family doesn't "just move in to the White House," she said. "You learn 
to live there. . . . But I really came to love that house." 
</P>
<P>
Among the high points: "In one week, I was in the Kremlin (with the 
Gorbachevs), Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth and Disney World with 
foster grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
She said the lowest point in her White House years came with the attempted 
assassination on Ronald Reagan, "when the bullet came within an inch of my 
husband's heart. Actually," she added, "I think the bullet got closer to my 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Although her spokesman said Mrs. Reagan had no objection to press coverage of 
her talk, and she stressed to the audience that she "would not trade our time 
in the White House for anything, the tremendous scrutiny of the media" had both 
"hurt" and frustrated her. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is like nothing you've ever imagined," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the china?" she asked, then paused. The crowd laughed. She sighed 
again. "Well, believe me, there was a time when I never wanted to hear the word 
china again." Mrs. Reagan explained that the new replacement china cost 
taxpayers nothing; it was donated. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember my sprucing up some rooms in the White House," she asked 
rhetorically. "And remember the flap over the designer dresses?" 
</P>
<P>
Each question was answered with laughter and applause by the crowd, which gave 
her two standing ovations and clearly admired her. 
</P>
<P>
Especially difficult, Mrs. Reagan said, were the media accounts -- quoting 
former Cabinet officials -- of her alleged influence on the President. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine how surprised I was to read I was calling the shots on the 
nuclear arms race," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a pink floral dress and appearing relaxed, Mrs. Reagan used humorous 
anecdotes to charm the audience. There was the story of how her husband 
accidentally pinned an important dignitary to the woman's chair when the 
President accidentally "planted (his feet) on the back of her dress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And there was the time when I was wooing a wealthy woman to contribute to the 
White House Historical Fund. And my wrap-around skirt unwrapped, and fell 
around my ankles," she said to more laughs. "And there I was." 
</P>
<P>
She also discussed her highly publicized campaign against drug abuse whose 
watchword is "Just Say No," calling it a five-year battle to convince America 
that drugs are indeed a national problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although she stopped short of criticizing President Bush's efforts, Mrs. Reagan 
did say that the country's attention should be shifted from foreign countries 
that export drugs, like Colombia, to education and the consumer. Her drug 
comments were particularly popular with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to share a few details of her upcoming book, "My Turn," Mrs. Reagan 
declined, saying her publisher has adamantly ordered her not to. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expressed concern over security, Mrs. Reagan arrived in a limousine 
at the front of the hotel, and guests who entered the ballroom to hear her 
underwent no special security measures. Secret Service agents stood discreetly 
at each side of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
However, several reporters, photographers and television crews were turned away 
from the registration desk Tuesday morning by three different organizers who 
refused to identify themselves. They claimed that there were "security 
problems" with Nancy Reagan, the day's keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizers claimed that they were following the her wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is mass confusion," said one harried organizer. "We invited everybody in 
the press, and now they can't come to hear her." 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old conference has attracted a bevy of Hollywood personalities, as 
well as women leaders in business and politics. Keynote speakers have included 
television personality Oprah Winfrey and exercise guru Richard Simmons, 
astronaut Sally Ride and Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole, who previously 
served as secretary of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
It has grown from a one-day conference that attracted only 500 participants to 
a three-day stint at the Anaheim Marriott with 75 seminars and an expected 
attendance of more than 10,000 women.

AMNESTY PROVISION PROMPTS NEW CAUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a little-known provision of the landmark amnesty program for illegal 
aliens now taking effect, law enforcement authorities and immigrant rights 
groups are warning applicants hoping for a last chance at legal status to watch 
for unscrupulous consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply so important that the immigrant community be educated so that 
they can be responsible consumers," said Father Jaime Soto, the Diocese of 
Orange episcopal vicar for Latinos, at a news conference Tuesday in Santa Ana. 
"Please, inform yourselves well." 
</P>
<P>
What has Soto and other members of the Orange County Immigration Fraud Task 
Force worried is the Replenishment Agricultural Worker program, or RAW, which 
over the next three years could legalize thousands more agricultural workers -- 
or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
The RAW program is part of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which 
has legalized 184,000 immigrants in Orange County. The program specifies that 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service can grant temporary resident 
status to agricultural workers, should federal officials determine that there 
is a shortage of such workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Due on Oct. 1 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, the U.S. secretaries of labor and of agriculture will decide whether 
there is such a shortage, said Bill King, director for legalization for the INS 
Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
If the officials decide that there is a shortage, RAW applicants selected at 
random by a computer will be invited to participate in the program, which could 
lead them to permanent residency status at the program's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The INS began accepting applications for the drawing Sept. 1, and more than 
6,000 in California were turned in on the program's first day. The registration 
period ends Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
A worker selected through the program must pay a $175 fee and be interviewed by 
an immigration official, who will determine whether he or she is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
The registration form is a simple card that requests basic information such as 
name, address and birth date. No supporting documentation is required, but 
applicants must attest that they have performed at least 20 days of 
agricultural labor during a 12-month period between May 1, 1985, and Nov. 30, 
1988, and be otherwise admissible as legal residents. Applicants must also 
agree to do seasonal agricultural work for at least 90 days during each of the 
next three years if selected as part of the RAW program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priority Consideration 
</P>
<P>
Illegal aliens already in the United States and those with immediate family 
members who qualified for amnesty under other provisions of the law would be 
considered first should there be a computer drawing, King said. 
</P>
<P>
King said, however, that some self-proclaimed "immigration consultants" are 
charging hundreds of dollars to help applicants fill out the simple cards, 
often with the promise that the consultant can improve the applicant's chances 
of being selected. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one outfit in Paterson, N.J., charging $6,000," King said. So far, 
there have been no reports of fraud in Orange County, but authorities expect 
that the same businesses that tried to cash in on other amnesty programs will 
seek to capitalize on this one as well. 
</P>
<P>
"For anyone outside now to be saying that 'We can guarantee for X number of 
dollars you can be chosen,' that's an out-and-out lie," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Balcer, a U.S. Department of Labor regional administrator in San Francisco, 
said the agency has "not detected any major shortages in California" so far. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Shortages Possible 
</P>
<P>
"There might be some spot shortages," Balcer said, "but up to now, there have 
not been any major shortages anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Such shortages could occur in future years, however, as agricultural workers 
who have been legalized under other provisions of the amnesty law leave 
agriculture for easier, more lucrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know . . . until we've had a few years under our belt" with the 
program, Balcer said. 
</P>
<P>
If a shortage develops anytime during the next three years, King said, 
immigration officials will draw upon the pool of registrants to be created in 
the next three months to fill the void.

ANOTHER CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER COMING OH-SO-CLOSE TWICE, LOS ALAMITOS, GRAGNANO POISED TO CONTEND AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are disappointments, and then there is Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two seasons, Los Alamitos has won 24 games, shutting out 12 
opponents and averaging 25.9 points a game. Two times, Los Alamitos advanced to 
championship games in the Southern Section playoffs, only to lose to a 
quarterback with a hot hand. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was a 36-6 loss to El Toro in the 1987 Southern Conference title 
game in which El Toro's Bret Johnson threw four first-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jack Manu of Paramount ran for 84 yards and passed for 159 in a 
30-20 victory over Los Alamitos in the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Los Alamitos is getting closer to that elusive title as 
veteran Coach John Barnes begins his 11th season with the Griffins, Orange 
County's top-ranked team in The Times' preseason football poll. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran quarterback, speedy backfield, strong offensive line and three 
talented defenders could finally help erase the disappointments of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gragnano, a very accurate left-hander, begins his third season at 
quarterback with more than 2,800 yards, and has an opportunity to become the 
first quarterback in county history to play in three championship games. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano has also shown that he's adept at running with the ball, rushing for 
two touchdowns in a semifinal victory over El Modena last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins' backfield of La Quan Beckton and Erik Mitchell is the county's 
best. Beckton, a 195-pound junior, combines speed with power. Mitchell, a 
transfer from Mayfair, looked sensational in the team's intrasquad scrimmage 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, probably the fastest player in the county since Kerwin Bell, averaged 
9.1 yards a carry for a mediocre team at Mayfair that won only three games. 
</P>
<P>
Center Jason Garrido anchors an offensive line that Barnes calls the school's 
best ever, and Brian Havens appears to be the next outstanding linebacker, 
following Roger Roadstrom and Eric Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Once again this preseason, The Times' Top 10 of Orange County is dominated by 
members of the South Coast League, with two-time defending champion Mission 
Viejo ranked second, El Toro third and Capistrano Valley 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The top four teams compete in Division III with fifth-ranked Edison and 
sixth-ranked Mater Dei the only Division I schools in the poll in what is 
generally considered a down year for the county's big schools. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the best of the rest: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
<P>
The county's best team last year lost the leading scorer in the state, slotback 
Eric Ekdahl, and the top-rated quarterback in the county, Troy Kopp, to 
graduation. But some are wondering if anyone will score against Mission Viejo 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven returning defenders, including all-league players Mark Slymen, Gregg 
Clapper and Chris Wild, form the nucleus of the best defense in the area. This 
is a big, physical team with 13 starters bench-pressing more than 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Ekdahl and Kopp will be difficult. Mission Viejo has only two 
returning offensive starters, but Coach Mike Rush thinks his skill-position 
players have the potential to be as explosive as last season, when the Diablos 
averaged 28.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
A 6-5 record and a third-place finish in the South Coast League last season was 
considered a down year at El Toro because the Chargers won 35 games in the 
three previous seasons. It should be a return to the norm in '89. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom passed for 1,774 yards and completed 56% of his 
attempts as a junior. He has improved strength, weighs 192 pounds and could 
give more publicized quarterbacks Gragnano and Danny O'Neil of Mater Dei some 
competition as the county's top quarterback before the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro potentially has its best ground game in years with a healthy Jerome 
Oakman returning after suffering a broken ankle in the third game last season. 
Coach Bob Johnson thinks Oakman is the best open-field runner to play at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. SANTA ANA 
</P>
<P>
Four league titles in a row and 40 victories in four years under veteran Coach 
Dick Hill have established Santa Ana as one of the premier programs in the 
county, and all the ingredients for another banner year are here. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Wilson, the best defensive player in the county for the past two years, 
is back. Wilson, Herb Prawl and Oswaldo Guerra, all-league selections as 
juniors, are the team's strength on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Santa Ana will be led by quarterback Jesse Rosas, who joined the 
team midway through last season. Danny Tuioti 
</P>
<P>
should shine at linebacker and tailback Garner Hicks will be among the area's 
best backs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
If Fontana is the best team in Division I -- according to the coaches' poll -- 
then Edison can't be too far behind, considering the Chargers outplayed Fontana 
in the opening round of the playoffs last season before losing, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Donnie Smith, who replaced injured Greg Angelovic in the seventh 
week of last season, completed 60% of his passes, threw for four touchdowns and 
won three of the four games he started as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
The receivers, led by Rocky Balch, are solid, and running back Shane Sherman 
gained 434 yards as a junior. The offensive line is one of the biggest in the 
county with guards Kip Winkler (6-3, 243) and Jeff Aseline (6-2, 221), center 
David Ryder (5-11, 188) and tackles Greg Schnabel (6-3, 224) and Lawson Mollica 
(6-4, 242). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rollinson, following Wayne Cochrun and Chuck Gallo, inherits the county's 
most demanding prep coaching position, one in which a coach is expected to win 
and look good in the process. Rollinson was a proven winner as a player at 
Mater Dei, losing one game in two seasons from 1966-67. 
</P>
<P>
He inherits one of the county's best quarterbacks, O'Neil, and a top running 
back, Kealii Clifford. O'Neil passed for 1,728 yards following a 
much-publicized transfer from Corona del Mar. Among the schools recruiting 
O'Neil are USC, Brigham Young, Stanford and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford rushed for 818 yards and 12 touchdowns as a junior and might be the 
county's most versatile runner when his pass-catching skills are considered. 
Look for Mater Dei to be a more run-oriented team under Rollinson than it was 
under pass-happy Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7. SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
<P>
No team in the county can boast a better trio of running backs than Sunny 
Hills, with Brian Pizula, Ken Overby and Mike Sullivan. Pizula averaged 9.1 
yards a carry and was second to Steve DePhillips of Fullerton in voting for the 
league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Overby, the bruiser of the group, is a strong, slashing runner. Sullivan, a 
transfer from Servite, is the speedster with agile moves and quick 
acceleration. Sunny Hills' offensive line is also formidable with center Robert 
Sung, right guard Darren Correll and right tackle Pat Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
There is a subtle hint that Sunny Hills is expecting big things when one looks 
at the Lancers' traditionally weak schedule and finds Esperanza and El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8. CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
<P>
What does Corona del Mar do for an encore after winning the Division VI title 
and going undefeated last season? How about continuing the county's longest 
unbeaten streak (14), beginning with a season-opener against Huntington Beach 
on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar lost the heart of a fine defense, linebackers John Katovsich and 
Chris Deuchar, to graduation, but 10 starters return, including twins Warren 
and Weston Johnson. Each of the Johnsons intercepted six passes as juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Ty Price, who played an instrumental role in the Sea Kings' drive 
to the championship, has graduated. Newcomer Jeff Kehrli will start. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9. TRABUCO HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Tim Manning, who has made life miserable for opposing quarterbacks the past two 
seasons with 20 interceptions, is now on the other side of the ball as a 
quarterback. Manning has the imposing task of replacing David Lowery, the 
Division VIII player of the year, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The transition from a passing game under Lowery to a more run-oriented attack 
under Manning shouldn't be a problem with junior fullback Ben Rooker, a 
Division I college prospect. Rooker scored 11 touchdowns as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Julian Ford and lineman Jim Farbaniec are among the best players at 
their positions in the county, and returning defensive back Rick Sparks tied 
Manning as the county's interception leader last season with 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10. CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley was a surprise in 1988. The Cougars' key players -- 
quarterback Tony Solliday, running back Chris Adams, wide receiver David Poltl, 
linebacker Ward Patton and free safety Jeremy Brion -- were underclassmen, but 
the team finished tied for second in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Brion has emerged as one of the county's best defensive backs. Adams scored six 
touchdowns after being promoted from the sophomore team midway through the 
season, but he will miss the team's opening two games with a muscle pull in his 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
Nose guard Damon Psaros, the most impressive player on the team for two years, 
returns for his third season.

<P>
This year's group of Orange County's top football players includes a few 
athletes who seem to have been around forever -- and some who are ready to 
burst onto the scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STILL GOOD AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gragnano, quarterback, Los Alamitos: Gragnano's form and function -- 
left-handed, soft passing touch, quick mind -- is similiar to that of former 
Fountain Valley quarterback David Henigan, last season's Division I co-player 
of the year. Gragnano sometimes gets overlooked because of an exceptional Los 
Alamitos defense that had five shutouts in 10 regular-season games last season. 
But he has thrown for more than 2,000 yards in each of the past two seasons, 
and doesn't often make mistakes. He threw only four interceptions last year. 
Gragnano (6-foot-2, 185) has the poise of a quarterback who has started 28 
games -- including two Southern Section finals -- in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Manning, quarterback/defensive back, Trabuco Hills: He has played 
cornerback, he has played safety, wide receiver, wingback and running back. He 
caught 37 passes last season for an average of 20.5 yards and scored 10 
touchdowns. Manning's strength goes beyond his athletic abilities and comes 
from simply being a tough kid. It's a tribute to Manning (5-11, 177) that no 
one questions whether he will do well at quarterback. "The kid is a player and 
now he'll have his hands on the ball on every down," said Gene Noji, Woodbridge 
coach. "That creates a problem for every team right away." Manning has 20 
career interceptions, leaving him just four short of setting the county record 
held by Mission Viejo's David Hill, who had 23. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Psaros, defensive lineman, Capistrano Valley: As aggressive a player to 
be found, he once said, "If nobody is looking, I'll step on you," and he means 
it. Coaches admit they're afraid of him, and they're from Capistrano Valley. 
Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton has gone about building the Capistrano 
Valley defense around Psaros, who is not big (6-0, 210) for a big-time player. 
Psaros makes up for his relative lack of size with speed and tenacity. In fact, 
it would seem his biggest challenge this season will not be beating the 
offensive lineman in front of him but convincing college scouts that he can 
play Division I ball. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Wilson, defensive lineman, Santa Ana: He literally broke onto the scene 
as an overgrown freshman who fractured the clavicle of an opponent in his first 
high school game. Over the past three years, he's left a wreckage pile of 
blocking schemes, blockers and coaches. "He's one gentleman I'll be glad to see 
go," said Bill Backstrom, El Modena coach. "He's been a man among children for 
the last two years. When he wants to do something, there's nothing you can do 
about it. You just hope he doesn't want to do it on every play." He is the most 
physically gifted football player in the county. Wilson was so dominating in a 
game against Loyola -- at one point, throwing an offensive lineman out of the 
way, then simultaneously tackling both running back and quarterback in 
mid-handoff -- that Loyola Coach Steve Grady said he was the best linemen his 
team had seen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP UNDERCLASSMEN 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Brion, free safety, Capistrano Valley: An all-league selection as a 
sophomore, Brion is a good athlete with a good mind -- reminiscent of El Toro's 
Adam Brass. Brion had three interceptions last season. 
</P>
<P>
Matt McCready, tight end, Los Amigos: College scouts have already taken notice 
of this big guy (6-3, 220) with good hands, who was an all-Garden Grove League 
selection as a sophomore. He had 24 receptions, and doubles as a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Karliner, quarterback, Ocean View: Operating in Ocean View's option 
offense, Karliner actually ran for more touchdowns (nine) than he threw (two). 
Has a strong arm, throwing for 1,400 yards last season, and was also selected 
an all-league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Rooker, running back, Trabuco Hills: With Trabuco Hills shuffling its 
lineup and Manning moving to quarterback, Rooker will be the team's main 
running back. A power runner, he scored eight touchdowns last season, and was 
the Mustangs' main man in goal-line situations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUYS WITH SOMETHING TO PROVE 
</P>
<P>
Coy Collins, running back, Loara: After gaining 799 yards as a sophomore in 
only eight games, hopes were high for Collins. But a slow start and a nagging 
ankle injury limited him to 532 yards and just two plays in league play last 
season. Loara Coach Herb Hill says Collins is healthy, which means he may 
fulfill the promise of his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Singletary, quarterback/defensive end, Rancho Alamitos: Singletary, as a 
tight end, was a favorite target of Rancho Alamitos quarterback Rod McCall last 
season. Now he's taking over for McCall, though he has no experience at the 
position. Rancho Alamitos hopes that Singletary's athletic skills and size 
(6-1, 195) will overcome his inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Hoover, running back, Costa Mesa: Hoover was just another 270-offensive 
lineman last year when he went to his coach, Tom Baldwin, and asked him to be 
allowed to play fullback. Baldwin told him if he lost 20 pounds he'd give him a 
chance. Hoover is at 238 pounds and could be a main cog in Costa Mesa's 
wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TWO TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sullivan, running back, Sunny Hills: Because he transferred from Servite, 
Sullivan, a junior, was forced to play on the sophomore team where he rushed 
for more than 1,200 yards. Look out for him this season. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Stewart, running back, El Toro: A sophomore transfer from North Carolina, 
Stewart has great speed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE VERY BEST OF THE REST 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: 
</P>
<P>
Danny O'Neil (Mater Dei) -- In his first varsity season, O'Neil ranked fourth 
in the county for total passing yardage with 1,728 yards and fifth for passing 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Smith (Edison) -- Filling in for the injured starter Greg Angelovic late 
last season, Smith led the Chargers to three league wins and performed well in 
the playoffs against Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Stenstrom (El Toro) -- Replacing Bret Johnson, Stenstrom responded by 
throwing for more than 1,600 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Bobby Anderson (Pacifica), Adam Garcia (El Modena), Trent 
Juilian (La Quinta), Chad Marlow (Brea-Olinda), Jesse Rosas (Santa Ana). 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK: 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brown (La Habra) -- Emerged from under the shadows of his older brother, 
Derek Brown, by rushing for 629 yards and 11 touchdowns in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Kealli Clifford (Mater Dei) -- He's perhaps the most versatile back in the 
county, adept at running inside and catching balls in the flat. Clifford, who 
started as a sophomore, rushed for 818 yards and scored 12 touchdowns last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Garner Hicks (Santa Ana) -- Averaged close to six yards a carry, he totaled 645 
yards even though his carries were limited by the fact that he had to share the 
ball with Estrus Crayton. With Crayton gone, Hicks will carry the brunt of the 
Santa Ana offense. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Mitchell (Los Alamitos) -- A transfer from Mayfair High, Mitchell is the 
fastest football player in the county, maybe the state. The 2-A champion at 200 
meters (21.35) as a sophomore, Mitchell, a senior, rushed for 1,129 yards and 
10 touchdowns on a Mayfair team that won just three games. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Papazian (Whittier Christian) -- He's a small school player whom big 
colleges are taking very seriously -- USC, UCLA, Nebraska, for example. It's 
not so much his stats -- 1,051 yards and 22 touchdowns last season -- it's his 
size and speed. Papazian is 6-2, 220. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Seymour (Woodbridge) -- Another versatile player, Seymour rushed for more 
than 700 yards and caught 42 passes for more than 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Shockley (Pacifica) -- Has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in the 
previous two seasons. Shockley is small (5-8) but stocky (170) and uses a 
slashing style to elude tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Wojtkiewicz (Estancia) -- Tough to tackle and tougher to pronounce -- Josh 
says it's Why-Cabbage. A 1,000-yard rusher, Wojtkiewicz is a big reason for 
Estancia's resurgence as a football power. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: LaQuan Beckton (Los Alamitos), Lance Brown (Esperanza), Tony 
Colthirst (Saddleback), Gil Greene (Orange Lutheran), Brian Lucas (Corona del 
Mar), Brian Pizula (Sunny Hills), Kenison PoChing (Savanna), Alex Ripley 
(Garden Grove), Ed Williams (Kennedy). 
</P>
<P>
WIDE RECEIVER: 
</P>
<P>
Matt Franklin (Santa Ana) -- On a predominantly running team, Franklin didn't 
get much of a chance to show what he could do. At 6-3, he's a good target for 
Jesse Rosas and has good hands. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Johnson (Corona del Mar) -- Had 28 catches for 330 yards last season. An 
exceptional athlete, as is his twin brother Weston, he had 14 receptions for 
229 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Milan (Los Alamitos) -- Likely to be Gragnano's favorite target and 
therefore figures to catch a lot of passes. He caught 23 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Weaver (Fountain Valley) -- Perhaps boasting the best hands in the county, 
Weaver caught 33 passes for 528 yards, an average of 16 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Mike Aulet (Estancia), Greg Hauser (Esperanza), Wes Kollar (La 
Quinta), Marcus Mitchell (Canyon), Tony Robinson (San Clemente), Joe Squyres 
(Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
TIGHT END: 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gibson (Woodbridge) -- At 6-3, 220-pounds, Gibson is a definite college 
prospect. In a diverse offense, Gibson caught 15 passes for 233 yards last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Haley (El Toro) -- A three-year starter, Haley has good speed, good hands 
and was a first-team all-league selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Rodarmel (Capistrano Valley Christian) -- Led Orange County in receptions 
last season with 66. Tall at 6-4, Rodarmel is relatively thin at 190. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Julian Ford (Trabuco Hills), Scott Sander (Sonora), Chad Smith 
(Tustin). 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE: 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Alo (Santa Ana Valley) -- A three-year starter, Alo anchors a huge Santa 
Ana Valley line that averages close to 240-pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Garrido (Los Alamitos) -- Perhaps the county's best center, Garrido is 
relatively light at 225 but may be the team's strongest player. 
</P>
<P>
Jason James (Buena Park) -- He'll play at 6-5, 295 pounds this season. That's 
down 30 pounds from last season, but coaches say he's stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Motherway (Mater Dei) -- The only remaining member of last season's 
giganto-line, which averaged 260 pounds. Motherway is not only big, but has the 
speed and intelligence to be exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Myers (Costa Mesa) -- At 290 pounds, Myers can straight out knock people 
over. Costa Mesa ran behind him last season to get to the playoffs for the 
first time in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Duensing (Esperanza) -- He's another in a long line of big and good 
linemen from this school. Gary Meek, Esperanza coach, has gone so far to say 
that Duensing (5-11, 245) may be one of the best guards in school history, and 
that's saying something. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: David Cuttrell (El Toro), Jeff Dorsz (Troy), Jim Farbaniec 
(Trabuco Hills), Ian Long (Newport Harbor), Loren Ragland (Santa Ana Valley), 
Brenden Stai (Esperanza), Scott Wohrman (Fountain Valley). 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE: 
</P>
<P>
Hartwell Brown (Los Alamitos) -- He's heavily recruited because of his size 
(6-4, 235), his versatility -- he can also play tight end and linebacker -- and 
his intelligence -- he scored 1,400 on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jaramillo (Valencia) -- One of the Southern Section's top heavyweight 
wrestlers last year, Jaramillo is another in a long line of exceptional 
Valencia linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Navidi (Esperanza) -- At 6-6, 255, Navidi was one of the main reasons 
Esperanza held seven opponents to 14 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Salazar (Servite) -- The lone returning starter off last season's Division 
I semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Seiu (Westminster) -- His relentless rushing and solid stature (6-0, 265) 
anchor the Lions' line. Along with teammate Vince Tauanuu, Seiu makes up the 
best line tandem to play both ways in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Slymen (Mission Viejo) -- Slymen (6-4, 245) is big and aggressive and was 
a first-team all-South Coast League selection as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Santiago Avalos (Santa Ana Valley), John Kockendorfer (Dana 
Hills), Brian Pearsall (Villa Park), Herb Prawl (Santa Ana), Aric Roman (Laguna 
Hills), Vince Tauanuu (Westminster), Danny Todd (Foothill). 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER: 
</P>
<P>
Greg Clapper (Mission Viejo) -- A main cog in what figures to be one of the 
county's top defenses. Clapper (6-1, 215) and teammate Chris Wild (6-2, 236) 
are as good a linebacking duo to be found in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Duff (Foothill) -- Enormous potential to go with enormous size, Duff is 
6-7, 230. He'll also play some at tight end this season. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Havens (Los Alamitos) -- He's the third solid Los Alamitos linebacker to 
emerge in the past three seasons. He's part of a defense that held 10 of 14 
opponents to single digits in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Olsen (Fullerton) -- Only a junior, Olsen (6-0, 215) is the strongest 
player on the Fullerton team and a big hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Tibbetts (Sonora) -- Tibbetts, who also doubles as a fullback, 
bench-presses more than 300 pounds and was an all-league selection as a junior. 
He's 6-0, 210. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Tuioti (Santa Ana) -- With Rosas taking over as quarterback, Tuioti is free 
to concentrate on his natural position. If he's anything like his older brother 
George, he'll be something to see. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch -- David Cloer (El Modena), Jason Gold (Anaheim), Jason 
Hairston (Foothill), Geoff Meek (Esperanza), Chris Wild (Mission Viejo). 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACK: 
</P>
<P>
Doug Cunningham (Huntington Beach) -- A three-year starter, Cunningham (6-2, 
195) is perhaps the best athlete in the Sunset League. He will also play 
running back this season. He has caught 52 passes over the past two seasons as 
a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Weston Johnson (Corona del Mar) -- He and twin brother Warren combined for 12 
interceptions last season -- six each -- to help lead one of the county's top 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm King (Buena Park) -- An all-league selection as a junior, King has 
excellent speed and hands. He had four interceptions last year. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sparks (Trabuco Hills) -- Along with teammate Manning, Sparks led the 
county in interceptions with 10. A good sense for the ball, Sparks will play a 
lot at wide receiver this season. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Gary Bladow (Villa Park), Trent Comer (Magnolia), Greg Ramsey 
(Loara), Kevin Smith (Cypress).

VALENCIA GIRLS' COACH WOELKE NAMED UC RIVERSIDE ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debi Woelke, who coached the Valencia High School girls' basketball team to the 
4-AA Southern Section championship last year, has resigned to become a women's 
basketball assistant at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Woelke, 32, compiled a record of 59-22 over the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I'll be as an assistant, but my ultimate dream is to be a 
head coach at a college," Woelke said. "So far as I've seen, you have to be an 
assistant first. Use it as a steppingstone." 
</P>
<P>
Woelke is a Valencia graduate. She played basketball for two years at Fullerton 
College, then went to Cal State Fullerton but did not play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A replacement for Woelke is expected to be named later this month.

NEW FACES JOIN OLD POWERS EDISON, FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Edison and Fountain Valley high schools are in the race for the 
Sunset League football championship, but a new team, Huntington Beach, may have 
the inside track this season. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of new faces, there are a couple of new coaches. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach John Seeley will try to end Marina's losing streak of 15 games 
-- the longest losing streak in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View, former Huntington Beach assistant Howard Isom replaces Guy 
Carrozzo, who is now head coach at Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster opted for a single coach instead of co-coaches. Jack Bowman was 
asked to step down, leaving Stan Clark as the head coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
What might all this mean for the league? 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't know, when there are coaching changes, how drastically the 
(teams) are going to change," Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner said. "We have 
been playing the same schools for a number of years but now, all the sudden, 
there are going to be changes." 
</P>
<P>
Two schools that had no coaching changes, Huntington Beach and Edison, are the 
class of the league this season. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe, in his sixth season, has 13 starters 
returning, and three promising transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Edison is ranked second in the Southern Section Division I preseason coaches' 
poll, behind Fontana. Coach Dave White has five starters back. 
</P>
<P>
Milner is still running the show at Fountain Valley, the defending league and 
Division I champion, but only two starters return. That does not mean the rest 
of the league is taking Fountain Valley lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who would overlook Fountain Valley would be foolish," Westminster's 
Clark said. "These guys were CIF champs. A lot of the kids who are coming back, 
and while they may not have been starters, they were the ones playing against 
the CIF championship guys in practice." 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EDISON 
</P>
<P>
"The key for us this year is that we have no great players, just a lot of good 
hard-working players, and if we stay healthy, we will be a good football team," 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers don't have a lot of depth so injuries could be key. They also lack 
experience. Only five starters return from last season's 9-2 team. Of those, 
only one, Donnie Smith, was an all-league selection. Smith made it as a punter 
though he filled in for Greg Angelovic at quarterback late last season when 
Angelovic missed four games with a broken thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Smith did well, completing 37 of 59 passes for 522 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Returning guards Kip Winkler (6-3, 249) and Jeff Aselin (6-2, 225) hold down an 
offensive line that averages about 230 pounds. Four players could see action at 
running back. But Shane Sherman, who rushed for 450 yards and scored five 
touchdowns last season as a backup to 1,000-yard rusher Gus Miranda, will do 
the bulk of the ball-carrying. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, returning starters Dan McCown, the strong safety, and cornerback 
Chad Ponegalek will give Edison strength and experience against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
One of the big questions at Fountain Valley: How do you replace David Henigan, 
the Southern Section Division I co-player of the year who completed 199 of 345 
passes for 2,944 yards and 23 touchdowns en route to a Division I championship? 
</P>
<P>
"He is an irreplaceable type of player," Milner said. "You enjoy the last three 
years and victories he has been responsible for, and start a new chapter in 
your life. It is kind of like trying to replace your son." 
</P>
<P>
Two candidates, seniors Jason Hassay (6-2, 185) and Willy Puga (6-1, 185) are 
competing for the starting job. They alternated as junior varsity quarterbacks 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
The major weakness is inexperience -- at quarterback and elsewhere. Only two 
starters return. 
</P>
<P>
"With the CIF championship team last year and the team that went to the CIF 
finals the year before, our juniors who are seniors this year got virtually no 
playing time at all," Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
The only offensive starter who returns is a good one. Wide receiver Doug 
Weaver, all-league last season, is the best in the county at his position. 
Strong safety Pat Tokeshi, a part-time starter last season, is the only 
experienced defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley will be tested early. Four of the Barons' preseason games are 
against ranked teams. "It is a very physical and thunderous preseason we play, 
meaning one right after another," Milner said. "We play Mater Dei, El Toro, 
Mission Viejo, El Modena and Long Beach Poly -- more commonly referred to as 
murderer's row. So if we can get through there and still remain intact 
health-wise, we can be a representative team in the Sunset League." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a windfall. Three quality players, two of whom are definite 
starters, transferred into the district and will play for Pascoe. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Dave Lacy, a wide receiver and defensive back, transferred from an 
Alabama school and will start. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Cotton, a 6-1, 215-pound senior who will start at outside linebacker and 
share time at tailback, transferred from Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Roman, a 6-1, 200-pound junior from Maryland, is not in the starting 
lineup yet, but is pushing for linebacker and offensive line spots, Pascoe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Oilers weren't hurting for players. Thirteen starters are back, more 
than any team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Without (the transfers), we would be very good anyway. But those guys can't do 
anything but help you," Pascoe said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' impact player is Doug Cunningham -- arguably the league's best 
athlete. Cunningham (6-2, 195) was all-league his junior year as a defensive 
back and wide receiver, catching more than 20 passes for more than 300 yards. 
He moves to fullback this season. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Jeff Gibson will replace graduated quarterback Eric Pettinato. Gibson 
was the quarterback of the junior varsity, taking the team to a 6-2 record last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARINA 
</P>
<P>
Seeley predicts the Vikings will be much more competitive than they have been 
the past two seasons. If the Vikings win just one game, that will be an 
improvement on the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Marina has has not won since it beat Long Beach Millikan in the last nonleague 
game of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Seeley, an assistant at Marina from 1976-80, says the attitude of the players, 
the students and the staff has been very positive. 
</P>
<P>
The players showed their enthusiasm by heeding Seeley's request to recruit for 
their team. Fifty-two players, many from other sports, came out for varsity 
football this season, significantly more than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kids wanting to improve," Seeley said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeley's expertise is defense. He spent six years as a defensive coordinator 
under Mike Marrujo at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
He inherits seven defensive starters, led by senior Dave McLeod, an all-league 
linebacker his sophomore and junior years, and all-league defensive tackle Matt 
Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Dave Schultz, a two-year starter at quarterback, heads a young offense. 
</P>
<P>
His main target figures to be senior Darren Fields, who started as a sophomore 
but did not play last year. Junior Kristen McLemore, a transfer from Torrance, 
will start at tailback. A slashing-style runner, McLemore (5-10, 175) started 
as a sophomore at Torrance. He has 4.6 speed and is a good pass-catcher and 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
Isom, who spent four years as the defensive coordinator, has six starters and 
seven part-time starters back from a team that finished fourth, one spot out of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks will run the run-and-shoot -- a one-back offense with four 
receivers. "It is an air offense, but it sets up your running game very well," 
Isom said. They will try for a balanced attack by using the wing-T. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has strength in the skill positions. Junior Randy Karliner (6-1, 
208) will be the quarterback. He started as a sophomore and passed for more 
than 1,400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The backs will be senior Quincy Bennett (5-9, 170) a part-time starter at 
fullback last season, and Sean Rogers (6-0, 175), a transfer from South Dakota 
who will play fullback and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has a speedy secondary. Senior Scott Caringella returns. He may have 
something to prove, having been overlooked for all-league honors last season 
though he led the league in interceptions with seven. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker is the big question mark due to the loss of Todd Norman, now at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WESTMINSTER 
</P>
<P>
The Lions have been to the playoffs the past four seasons, but they are going 
to have to grow up in a hurry if they want to make it this season. 
</P>
<P>
Only three starters return to play a very tough nonleague schedule. All five of 
Westminster's nonleague opponents -- La Quinta, Millikan, Esperanza, Capistrano 
Valley and Valencia -- are rated in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Seui (6-0, 265) is an impact player. He was all-league at offensive guard 
and defensive tackle last season, and will anchor the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Tauanuu (6-3, 225) moves to tight end from offensive tackle this season 
and will also play defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
Up from the sophomore team to start at quarterback is Vance Senteno. 
</P>
<P>
The squad is very young and has only 43 players, down from 52 last year.

Gregory Sanchez sometimes apologizes for the inadequacies of a collection that 
includes 800 football cards, 2,000 basketball cards and about 400,000 trading 
cards of the baseball variety. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a lot more basketball cards, but they've been hard to find at 
times," explained Sanchez, a 36-year-old manager of a resort near Frazier Park. 
"Basketball and football cards haven't been distributed as well as baseball 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of potential customers such as Sanchez, professional athletic leagues 
and a number of companies are entering the trading card business. The new 
players in this business hope to score in the wide-open field for basketball 
and football trading cards, estimated to have a combined sales value of only 
about $13 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of hobbyists trade or sell or save sports trading cards, 
collectibles that tend to appreciate in value with age. Sanchez, a sports fan 
who prefers basketball, is part of a burgeoning customer base that is rapidly 
convincing sports marketing firms that profits -- big profits -- are in the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League kicked things off earlier this month when it 
introduced a product called "The Official NFL Card," a package containing 14 
player cards and bonuses -- a card commemorating Super Bowls and a scratch-off 
card for prizes. The NFL, which manufactures its cards, will butt heads with 
Score Inc., a Dallas-area firm that began to distribute NFL-licensed cards this 
summer. The NFL and Score are lining up their gridiron collectibles against a 
version produced by Topps, the established producer of NFL-licensed cards. 
</P>
<P>
The competition will expand again when the National Basketball Assn. takes a 
shot by introducing NBA Hoops Cards through the Durham, N.C.-based Liggett 
Group, a candy- and tobacco-making firm that will produce and distribute cards 
bearing photographs of professional round-ballers. The Hoops cards will go 
one-on-one against the Philadelphia-based Fleer Corp., the veteran producer of 
NBA basketball cards. While Fleer's product is licensed by the NBA, the Liggett 
Group's entry will carry the official endorsement of the league. 
</P>
<P>
The new competitors in the card market hope to challenge baseball card 
producers, firms that have long dominated the sports collectibles industry. The 
baseball card business was once dominated by New York-based Topps Co., the sole 
maker of the major league collectibles until 1980. The industry is now highly 
competitive, accommodating a Chicago-area firm called Donruss and two other 
major producers. In fact, industry observers say the new players helped 
generate the boom in the sale of new baseball cards, boosting it from a 
$25-million business in 1980 to a $350-million enterprise in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotional Campaign 
</P>
<P>
"The basketball and football card market is taking the same course that 
baseball took when competitors entered the market," observed Jeffrey Kurowski, 
an editor at Sports Collectors Digest, an Iola, Wis., publication that assesses 
the value of vintage trading cards and other sports collectibles. "Baseball has 
a gigantic (card) market. By making its own card, the NFL is stimulating more 
interest in football cards . . . and the NBA is generating more interest in 
(basketball) cards by officially backing a product." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA and the Liggett Group are now gearing up for an advertising and 
promotional program for the Hoops card, which will debut in stores in 
mid-November, according to Don Fish, the NBA's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a mania for all sports trading cards now," Fish said. "A lot of things 
were put together real quickly to put this deal together. There are 100,000 to 
150,000 new collectors each year. We wanted to be prepared to take advantage of 
this (interest)." 
</P>
<P>
Liggett also arranged to market and distribute the NFL's official football 
cards in conjunction with Pro-Set, a Dallas-based firm. Tony Dale, publishing 
director for NFL Properties, said the NFL will spend about $1.5 million this 
year and $3 million to $5 million in 1990 to tout the cards. Media vehicles 
will include cable television's Nickelodeon, publications such as Boys' Life 
and sports magazines such as Sports Illustrated and Street &amp; Smith. "With 
the astounding growth of trading card sales the past few years, it seemed 
appropriate to get involved in cards," Dale said. "We're interested in the 
collector market, which is primarily adults. But we're also interested in 
youngsters because kids are more enthusiastic about baseball cards and we hope 
to tap into that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Faces Create Identity' 
</P>
<P>
The NFL hopes to stimulate youthful interest in the cards and the sport through 
its promotional campaign. Dale said football card sales have traditionally 
lagged far behind the baseball collectibles partly because younger sports fans 
-- ages 6 to 15 -- find it more difficult to identify with the game's players. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal with the unfortunate obstacle of player helmets," Dale explained. 
"Young fans don't see (player) faces and faces create identity for players." 
</P>
<P>
To compensate, the NFL produced a card that shows two sides of its athletes. 
One side shows a player in action -- sprinting, throwing or poised to make a 
block or tackle. The same player appears sans helmet on the flip side. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL and other new competitors are already generating new interest in the 
football and basketball card market, according to James Echeandria, head of 
American Consulting Corp., Orlando, a Florida-based consultant to the 
confectionary food and trading card industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The common wisdom was that football cards don't sell," Echeandria said. "(NFL) 
Pro-Set and Score are proving that thinking is wrong. Football card sales could 
more than quadruple . . . and easily reach $50 million by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
NFL and NBA executives hope to generate some new sales by promoting their cards 
at card trading shows, marketplaces that have been dominated by baseball 
collectibles. While a 1984 Michael Jordan basketball card fetches about $50 and 
a 1976 Walter Payton football card might sell for $100, those classic cards 
cannot compare to the valued collectibles in baseball. Buoyed by the heavy 
demand for all baseball cards, a 1952 Mickey Mantle sells for $6,500 and a 1909 
Honus Wagner nets a whopping $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Sanchez, who has trudged through card shows in a disappointing search for 
football and basketball cards, hopes the NBA and the NFL successfully cultivate 
the trade show market. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball and football need more of a presence at shows because people who 
collect cards as an investment are a big part of the market," Sanchez said. 
"Collectors are like athletes. Some are in it for the love of the sport, and 
some are in it for the money."

JAMES FLANIGAN: A BRAVE NEW WORLD IN BID BY UAL PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilots and other employees of United Airlines seem about to win the bidding 
contest for UAL Inc. in a buyout worth at least $6.5 billion, and make it the 
largest employee-owned company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wow, you say, are the employees getting a good deal? Have working people 
discovered a get-rich-quick scheme of their own? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes, it's probably a good deal, but get rich quick it isn't. If 
the employees get rich at all it will be slowly -- a payoff is at least several 
years away -- and meanwhile there is risk, and cuts in pay and changes in the 
way they work. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. Ownership will change profoundly the employees' 
understanding of job security, union membership and collective bargaining. Who 
represents the workers, after all, when the workers are the bosses? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Davis Could Bid Higher 
</P>
<P>
Before United's people enter that brave new world, of course, they first must 
lock up the deal. But there's not much uncertainty. Investor Marvin Davis still 
could bid higher than the $300 a share that the Airline Pilots Assn.'s group 
offered last week. But even if Davis offers more, says analyst Daniel Hersh of 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, it's unlikely he can buy the airline without 
the promise of wage and work-rule concessions from United's employees and the 
tax advantages of their proposed employee stock ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
So in the near future, presuming that other details are worked out, the airline 
is likely to be 75% owned by its pilots, machinists and flight attendants, with 
British Airways owning 15% and UAL's current management owning 10%. The 
managers will continue to manage, but under the supervision of an 
employee-controlled board. 
</P>
<P>
But then will come years of pay-back and change. To pay their share of the 
buyout, the pilots are going to put up some of their pension money and give 
wage and work rule concessions worth $250 million a year for an undisclosed 
number of years. That means they will fly more hours per month at the same or 
lower pay and accept labor-saving advances such as new planes that fly with two 
men in the cockpit instead of three. United's other unions will give $120 
million a year in concessions producing a total of $370 million a year in cost 
reductions to help United repay the borrowings that finance the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The really subtle changes, however, will come when air travel hits one of its 
periodic downturns. Normal practice in the industry is to furlough employees -- 
airline jargon for lay off. But in the new United how will furloughs be 
decided? Can union seniority rules -- layoffs for younger pilots, flight time 
for older ones -- apply when all are owners? Or will the solution be shared 
misery: Short weeks to stretch the work, collective wage cuts to meet the 
payroll. It's all part of owning a business, after all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security an Issue 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder that labor expert Brian Freeman, an investment banker who is 
currently representing United's machinists, says traditional collective 
bargaining agreements that protected workers and left the headaches to 
management are preferable to employee ownership plans. "Unions should be 
concerned with long-term job stability, not ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman may be right, but so what? In today's world of rapid economic change, 
takeovers and mass layoffs, the security of traditional labor-management 
contracts has been taking a beating -- especially in the deregulated airline 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most secure employment in the industry has been offered by mostly 
non-union Delta Airlines, which has not laid off an employee since the late 
1950s and could serve as a lesson plan for United Airlines employee 
owners-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
How does Delta do it? Often with common sense. In the 1970s, when air travel 
fell due to the energy crisis, now-retired Chairman David C. Garrett asked 
shareholders to take a lower dividend so loyal employees could keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the recession of the early 1980s, Delta employees worked at whatever 
was available rather than be laid off. Unionized pilots loaded baggage, others 
did extra duty in the marketing department. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that Delta has more than its share of long-term employees, and 
that means higher labor costs. But it also has a high reputation for service -- 
and that is paying off in all its markets today. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Delta's a throwback, an example of paternalistic, if intelligent, 
management, and different from an employee-owned or even a heavily unionized 
company. But if United's new owners can borrow some of that intelligence -- as 
well as the flexibility and quality of service -- they can do even better than 
Delta's people. Because their success can produce a real pot of gold. 
</P>
<P>
When the UAL buyout debt has been paid down -- perhaps five or six years from 
now -- United Airlines will sell stock to the public again. And then the 
employees who today are pledging their pension and wages and work rules will be 
able to reap the rewards of ownership. And they'll have earned them.

Sara Lee to Drop 'Light' Claim: Sara Lee Corp. will drop the words "light 
classics" from the packages and advertising of some whipped dessert products 
under an agreement it signed with the attorneys general of nine states. 
Although the company said the complaint has no merit, it said it settled the 
suit to save legal expenses and will pay $80,000 for the costs of the 
government investigation. A Sara Lee spokesman said the attorneys general 
objected on the grounds that light implied fewer calories. The nine states 
involved are California, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, 
New York, Texas and Wisconsin.

T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.88%, down from 7.94% last week. Another 
$7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
7.87%, down from 7.88% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 8.15% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,800.80, and 8.31% for a six-month bill selling for $9,602.10. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.

TAX-DEFERRED SAVINGS PLANS A 'CRUEL HOAX,' STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Tax-deferred savings plans such as IRAs have become a "cruel hoax" for many 
retirees who find themselves subject to higher income tax rates than when they 
were young, according to a private study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A report from the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit research 
group based in Dallas, said tax-deferred savings programs were designed to help 
working people postpone taxes until retirement, when they traditionally moved 
to lower tax brackets. 
</P>
<P>
But because some Social Security benefits now are taxed and some elderly people 
pay a new surtax for Medicare coverage against catastrophic illnesses, many 
middle-income retirees "are discovering their marginal tax rate is up to four 
times higher than the rate they paid while working," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Cited 
</P>
<P>
"These two taxes combined can raise the marginal tax rates of elderly retirees 
as much as 37 percentage points," said Aldona Robbins, a former Treasury 
Department economist and a co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"For many people, the promise of tax-deferred savings is a cruel hoax," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an elderly widow with $24,000 of income from interest, dividends 
and a pension in addition to her Social Security benefits faces a 1989 marginal 
tax rate of 48.3%, the study said. Without the Social Security and Medicare 
taxes, she would be in the 15% federal income tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that in addition to today's retirees, many younger people also 
would be better off avoiding tax-deferred savings programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Incentive 
</P>
<P>
"Many workers today are avoiding a 15% income tax rate when they put money into 
IRAs," Robbins said. "When they withdraw the funds during retirement, they may 
be taxed at a rate that is three to four times higher." 
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the higher tax rates for the elderly jeopardize the 
nation's ability to stimulate the personal savings needed to fuel investment in 
the U.S. economy and increase productivity. 
</P>
<P>
"To the degree that government confiscates income from savings, the incentive 
to save is reduced for everyone -- old and young," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The study recommended abolishing both the Social Security and Medicare taxes or 
at least changing the tax treatment of retirement savings, perhaps by allowing 
people to pay taxes on deposits to savings programs at the point when their 
marginal tax rates are lower. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1983 Social Security revisions, half of Social Security benefits are 
subject to federal income tax if half the benefits plus all non-Social Security 
income exceed $25,000 for an individual or $32,000 for a couple. For these 
people, 50 cents of Social Security benefits is taxed for each dollar of 
additional income. 
</P>
<P>
The Medicare surcharge for the elderly was approved by Congress last year to 
help finance coverage of catastrophic illnesses. In 1989, a 15% surtax is 
imposed on federal income tax liabilities over $150, affecting about 40% of 
those 65 and older, with the surtax rising to 28% by 1993. The maximum surtax 
payment is capped at $800 per person in 1989 and rises to $1,050 in 1993.

WORKERS' COMP JUDGE RIPS NEW PLAN FOR L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The top judge of Los Angeles' busiest workers' compensation court charged 
Tuesday that state plans to staff a new court in Pasadena by shifting workers 
from neighboring jurisdictions stands to "cripple" an already overwhelmed 
system and dramatically lengthen the process of resolving injured workers' 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Bettina A. Bate of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board in 
Los Angeles said the current 8- to 10-week wait for a trial in cases which both 
workers and employers say are ready for hearing could expand to as long as a 
year in a restructuring planned by the state Division of Industrial Accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Division of Industrial Accidents say the opening of the 
new office is intended to streamline the Los Angeles court and improve service 
to injured workers in northeast Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and 
portions of the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More People Added to the System' 
</P>
<P>
The change is part of an overhaul of jurisdictional boundaries in the workers' 
compensation court system that will add 10 judges in Southern California, said 
John A. Merrill, statewide assistant chief of the appeals board, 
</P>
<P>
"More people are being added to the system, we're rearranging the workload to 
fit, and we're moving some of the offices to better serve the area," Merrill 
explained. "She thinks bigger is better," he said of Bate's objections. "We 
think smaller is easier to manage." 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half the geographic territory now served by the Los Angeles board will 
become the responsibility of the new Pasadena board under the state's plan, 
scheduled to go into effect Nov. 15. The Los Angeles court will lose four of 
its 10 judges in the process. Two judgeships, now vacant, will be shifted to 
Pasadena from Van Nuys, and two more judges will move to Pasadena from the 
Norwalk court. 
</P>
<P>
But Bate said she doubted that a corresponding portion of the 127,000 cases 
pending in the Los Angeles court would be shifted to Pasadena. She also 
questioned the efficacy of Merrill's plan to bring in clerks from around the 
state to go through the backlogged cases, one by one, to identify those to be 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Bate said workers and employers in areas far from Pasadena will be 
inconvenienced by having to travel there to complete cases in which hearings 
have already been opened by judges who will be moving to the new court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Agenda Denied 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys also have objected to the state's plans, charging they are part of a 
larger effort by the administration of Gov. George Deukmejian to force drastic 
reform of the workers' compensation system by miring it in backlogs and 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's compounding a terrible, terrible problem," said Gerald C. Benezra, a Los 
Angeles attorney who is chairman of the workers' compensation legislation 
committee of the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill said there was no hidden agenda to the overhaul. "We want delays to 
decrease," he said. "That's why the whole thing is being done." 
</P>
<P>
A proposal in Sacramento to drastically revamp the state's workers' 
compensation system remains bogged down in legislative back rooms, with 
negotiations between business, labor, lawyers, physicians and insurers stalled.

OPEC OIL OUTPUT UP IN AUGUST, AGENCY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
OPEC nations opened their oil taps a bit more in August to boost their crude 
production to one of the highest levels so far this year, according to 
estimates released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil market report that the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped about 21.6 million barrels 
of oil a day last month -- up 200,000 barrels from a revised July figure of 
21.4 million and 2.6 million barrels a day higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
The IEA estimate also is about 2 million barrels more than the 
19.5-million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources have put OPEC's August production at between 21.5 million and 
21.7 million barrels. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a respected trade 
newsletter, estimated OPEC's July output at 21.8 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 in West Texas 
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, from $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the 
year's low of $12.60 on Oct. 5. While higher demand has kept prices from 
falling as dramatically this year, prices have weakened, and analysts say they 
could continue to do so before they recover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$18-a-Barrel Target 
</P>
<P>
By October, consumers could see a slight decline in retail gasoline prices -- 
about 2 to 3 cents a gallon, said William Veno, director of oil market analysis 
for Data Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the higher output came from Iran, which had experienced a 
decline in July," the IEA report said. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 OPEC nations agreed in June to try to keep output under control and 
prices near a target of $18 a barrel. But despite the promises, the cartel's 
supply has remained strong, depressing prices from their highs of last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a basket of the seven OPEC-monitored crudes registered 
$16.44 a barrel at the end of August, compared to $18 last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for West Texas Intermediate have been running in the range of $18 to $19 
a barrel, but other U.S. crudes have been weaker. The benchmark crude, which a 
growing number of analysts say does not represent the market, had been up to 
$24 a barrel in April. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York, 
said OPEC's production seems to have stabilized. "They've kind of found their 
level and the market is pretty much absorbing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Higher demand this year -- about 1 million barrels a day more -- is one reason 
prices haven't fallen further, Veno said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Raise Supply Cap 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, lower U.S. production and oil rig accidents in the North Sea and 
elsewhere have lowered world oil output and enabled OPEC to pump more oil 
without serious repercussions, Veno said. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for them not to undermine prices further and precipitate a collapse, 
OPEC will have to hold production at about 21.6 million barrels," Veno said. 
While fourth-quarter demand is expected to grow, North Sea and other non-OPEC 
production also is expected to grow as repairs are completed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An OPEC monitoring panel will meet in Geneva on Sept. 23 to analyze the market 
and decide whether to raise the supply cap to around 20 million barrels a day 
in the last quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates produced 1.8 million barrels a day in August, well 
above its OPEC-set ceiling of about 1 million barrels, the IEA reported. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's output last month was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day, up from 
its target of 1 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Nigeria pumped about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, higher than its 
1.4-million-barrel quota. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, produced 4.8 million barrels a 
day, about the same as its target. 
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq both pumped at their quota levels of 2.8 million barrels a day, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Iraq was nearing completion of a pipeline through Saudi 
Arabia that would increase its capacity to export oil to about 3 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The output of other cartel members in August was at or near their targets: 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels a day; Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels; Algeria, 
700,000 barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; Qatar, 
400,000 barrels, and Gabon, 200,000 barrels.

TAKEOVER TALK SENDS CONRAIL STOCK SOARING

Shares of Conrail, created in the 1970s as the holding company for several 
bankrupt Northeastern railroads including Penn Central, closed at a new high 
for the year Tuesday on speculation that the freight carrier may be a takeover 
target, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail stock closed at $45.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 87.5 cents. 
Its previous 52-week high was $44.375. The stock has risen almost 15% in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail, formally known as Consolidated Rail Corp., declined to comment on its 
stock activity. 
</P>
<P>
Provident National Bank analyst Andrew Geller tied Conrail's gain to the 
potential for a buyout or restructuring after Conrail's statutory takeover 
protection ends next April. 
</P>
<P>
The government, which had taken over the struggling railroad companies, sold 
shares to the public in 1987 at $28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Since then it has been solidly profitable, earning $142 million or $2.07 a 
share in this year's first half on revenue of $1.75 billion. In 1988, the 
freight railroad, whose market extends from the Northeast to Chicago, earned 
$306 million or $4.44 per share on revenue of $3.49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the spinoff plan, non-rail buyers are blocked until April 3, 1990, from 
acquiring more than 10% of Conrail, while other railroads can buy more than 
10%, but not vote their shares before then. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the spinoff also restrict until Oct. 21, 1991, the amount of net 
income Conrail can use for dividends and stock buybacks. Under the restriction, 
Conrail currently has $107 million available for such uses, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert rail analyst Linda Dunn said she has been recommending 
Conrail as the most attractive restructuring candidate among rail stocks due to 
its strong balance sheet and its upcoming loss of takeover protection. She 
estimated Conrail's break-up value at $70 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Geller said there was also speculation "Conrail will try to do something to 
forestall (a takeover) by trying to get its stock price up." He said it might 
pursue a large cash dividend or stock buyback. 
</P>
<P>
Although Conrail has recently raised its dividend and may do so again in the 
future, it is limited in the amount it can distribute to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Dividend Needed 
</P>
<P>
Geller said Conrail may ask Congress by the end of the year to remove the 
dividend restriction in order to take steps to boost the price of the stock. 
Conrail stated previously that it would not seek favors from Washington until 
it completed a "strategic process" to enhance share value. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon Bros. analyst Michael Lloyd said the dividend restriction made takeover 
speculation premature. 
</P>
<P>
If an acquirer could not pay itself a large dividend before October, 1991, the 
purchase would be less attractive, he said. "I can't believe anybody would be 
getting excited about it right now," he added.

A federal judge Tuesday approved a settlement of a 6-year-old racial 
discrimination suit against General Motors Corp. that requires the auto maker 
to pay up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that GM discriminated against nearly 10,000 salaried black 
employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana in its promotion, wage, transfer and 
layoff policies. Of those, about 7,000 still work for GM. 
</P>
<P>
After years of legal wrangling, attorneys for GM and the employees reached an 
agreement last Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The decree calls on GM to pay between $1 million and $1.6 million to about 
2,800 former employees, depending on the number of claims filed. GM also will 
pay about $1 million in salary increases immediately to about 1,000 current 
employees. Eighty-eight individual plaintiffs and witnesses will split about 
$322,500 in one-time payments. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also establishes a system to monitor discretionary pay raises 
and promotions for five years based on computer models. That portion of the 
agreement has the potential of being the most beneficial, said attorney Dennis 
James, who represented the employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that's where the vast benefit comes in," he said. "It will affect a 
substantial increase in black salaried promotions compared to the past 
patterns." 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman John Mueller said company officials had not seen the order. 
However, he said the agreement "provides the opportunity to redress some 
perceived inequities and strengthens GM's existing systems to ensure all 
employees receive equitable treatment."

Six years after opening in a trailer in San Clemente, Mission Valley Bank 
finally has managed to see construction of its headquarters begin next door in 
what will become the Mission Valley Bank Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The bank will occupy 12,000 square feet of the 14,000-square-foot structure at 
the corner of Avenida Palizada and El Camino Real. Construction is expected to 
be completed next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza is a joint venture between Steve Samuelian of Emerald Development in 
San Juan Capistrano and four bank directors -- Stewart S. Mortensen, Jack R. 
Barnes, Fred Debs and John Gorny. Mortensen is the bank's chairman and Barnes 
is president. Each group owns 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The bank sold the land to the joint venture for $1.4 million, making a gain of 
$500,000. The joint venture borrowed $2 million from competitor Mariner's Bank 
for construction and will lease the structure back to Mission Valley Bank for a 
long term at market value. The joint venture would not reveal the monthly lease 
payment because it intends to rent the remaining space to other firms. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of August, Mission Valley Bank had earned $574,000 for the year, 
more than the once-sleepy bank had made in any previous year. It has about $34 
million in assets.

The Bicentennial of the signing of the U.S. Constitution was toasted two years 
ago nationwide, but part of that celebration is just now arriving at three 
Orange County branches of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
A special exhibit of 14 works by artist Norman Rockwell, which has been on tour 
for two years, arrived at the S&amp;L's Laguna Beach branch last month and now 
is at the Newport Beach branch until Friday. The lithographs, signed by 
Rockwell, will be displayed in GlenFed's Anaheim branch starting Monday before 
they leave the county. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit was put together by GlenFed as its part in celebrating the 
Bicentennial. The exhibit includes some of Rockwell's best-known paintings for 
the Saturday Evening Post, including the "Four Freedoms," which are entitled, 
"Freedom of Speech," "Freedom of Religion," "Freedom From Want" and Freedom 
From Fear." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Federal first set up the exhibit at its main office in Glendale and 
then sent it on a trip to 42 of its 208 branches in California and Florida. 
Meantime, the S&amp;L also picked up University Savings in Washington, but the 
exhibit is not scheduled to go there.

CODERCARD INC. FILES FOR PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Codercard Inc., a Santa Ana maker of computer security devices, has filed for 
protection from its creditors in federal bankruptcy court and a top executive 
said Tuesday that he expects the firm to pay off its debts in two to four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The filing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act on Friday was 
precipitated by a petition that sought to force Codercard into liquidation 
proceedings. Three former employees filed that involuntary bankruptcy petition 
last month in claiming about $54,000 in back wages. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Officer Ronald Hofer said Codercard will file a reorganization 
plan with the court within 14 days "which will set out in detail how and who 
will get paid. This allows us to get control of the situation so we can pay off 
the creditors." 
</P>
<P>
Hofer said Codercard has "sufficient resources" to pay its debts, which he said 
total $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana company has developed and is trying to market a computer security 
device that uses a plastic card with an embedded microchip that prevents 
unauthorized access to computers. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1983 the company has spent more than $5 million on 
research and development, but sales have been nominal. In fiscal 1988, the 
company posted total revenue of only $300,000. In the third quarter ended March 
31 the company lost $478,379 and posted no sales. 
</P>
<P>
"They have excellent products but no financing," said Lee Bergquist, formerly 
vice president for engineering and one of the three ex-employees who filed the 
bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
One bright spot for Codercard was a contract valued at $475,000 signed in May 
with the Australian national telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the company has concentrated on trying to sell its device to 
federal government agencies, like the super-secret National Security Agency and 
the Defense Department but has been unable to land any government contracts. 
The company fired its chief of governmental business operations two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hofer remained optimistic about the company's future saying: "Actually this 
will help strengthen the company because it is an opportunity to pay off 
creditors with a combination of cash and shares of Codercard common stock."

KNOTT'S HEIR TO CORKSCREW IS SURE TO BOOMERANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A roller coaster that turns riders upside down six times will replace Knott's 
Berry Farm's 14-year-old Corkscrew, which turns them upside down just twice. 
</P>
<P>
The new ride, as yet unnamed but known generically as "the boomerang," is 
scheduled to open in 1990, according to Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville. It 
will be built in the same area as the pioneering Corkscrew, which was the first 
modern coaster to perform upside-down revolutions. The Corkscrew is scheduled 
to close Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by Vekoma International of Holland, boomerangs have been built in 
at least four other amusements parks in the United States and Canada and in 
other countries around the world, according to such roller coaster authorities 
as Paul L. Ruben, editor of RollerCoaster! magazine. 
</P>
<P>
As described by Ruben, the ride begins when a train is pulled backward up to 
the top of a 45-degree slope. The train is then catapulted through a 
heart-shaped "double barrel roll," in which riders are turned upside down 
twice. They then enter a separate upside-down loop and ascend a second slope. 
From that point, a height of more than 100 feet, riders are shot through the 
whole sequence again -- backward. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the boomerang very much but can't ride it more than about three times 
in a row without feeling a little nauseous," Ruben said. "The double barrel 
backwards is particularly harrowing and disorienting." 
</P>
<P>
The ride is comparable to but bigger than Knott's Montezooma's Revenge, a more 
jolting coaster than the Corkscrew, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Zanville, who has not ridden a boomerang but confirmed Ruben's description, 
said: "Vekoma tells us (the boomerang) has the tightest loops and turns of any 
roller coaster, so there are very, very rapid changes in direction, which are 
supposed to be extremely exciting." 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the new ride, including installation, has not been 
determined, Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Wonderland -- an amusement park near Toronto that opened a boomerang 
called the Bat in May, 1987 -- paid $3.7 million, a Wonderland spokesman said. 
The Corkscrew, opened in May, 1975, cost Knott's $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Bat lasts about two minutes and packs a top speed of 50 m.p.h., Wonderland 
officials said. The Corkscrew lasts one minute and 15 seconds and hits up to 32 
m.p.h., Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way to sell the Corkscrew, Zanville added, though a buyer has 
not been named.

MILSAP INSERTS SOME SOLID, AFFECTING MOMENTS IN GLIB, FORMULAIC SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronnie Milsap's compromised country music practically epitomizes everything the 
"new traditionalist" movement sought to overturn: His crossover style crossed 
so far over that his records often sounded closer to Lionel Richie than to 
Jimmie Rodgers, and, like Richie's, his songs could be so slick as to have no 
hold on reality. 
</P>
<P>
But in an odd way, the success of the traditionalists might make it easier for 
some to appreciate Milsap's music. Now that country purists don't have to be 
outraged by Milsap and other main-streamers squeezing the grittier country off 
the airwaves, they might relax a bit and find that he can be a solid and 
affecting performer. 
</P>
<P>
He proved to be just that several times in his late show Monday evening at 
Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House and Saloon -- although those moments were 
packed into a show that was largely glib and formulaic. 
</P>
<P>
The blind singer/pianist and his eight-piece band opened with serviceable 
versions of the wan hits "Don't You Know How Much I Love You," "Don't You Ever 
Get Tired of Hurting Me" and "What a Difference You've Made in My Life." 
</P>
<P>
He then crammed seven of his early hits into a medley where the truncated 
versions were scarcely longer than their cumbersome titles. While such medleys 
might be the only way Milsap could fit his many hits into the show, the 
bite-size renditions were too brief to build any emotional effect. And some, 
such as the tragic "It Was Almost Like a Song" and the novelty-item "I'm a 
Stand by My Woman Man," were horribly juxtaposed. 
</P>
<P>
A medley of songs by rock piano greats fared better, particularly when he 
mimicked Ray Charles on "What'd I Say" and "Georgia." He even climbed atop his 
piano and jumped off at the end of Little Richard's "Lucille." 
</P>
<P>
Milsap had joked throughout the show about his blindness and his ability to get 
around on stage. Although most of the humor and his patter with band members 
seemed rehearsed, there was at least one unexpected moment: When he joked about 
falling into the audience, commenting, "At 200 pounds, I'd ruin someone's 
evening," an undaunted female fan shouted: "You can fall on my table!" 
</P>
<P>
Milsap's gravity as a performer best came across, oddly enough, on his most 
overtly crossover numbers. Although pumped by a disco beat and warbling 
synthesizers, Milsap sang "Button Off My Shirt" and the encore "Stranger in My 
House" with exuberance and spirit. It might not have been country, by any 
hard-line definition, but it worked.

3-PERSON SHOW RUNS FROM COMPLEX TO SITCOM SUPERFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the ninth installment of its New! Improved! annual juried show which 
closed last month, the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art seems to be on 
a roll. In a three-person show (through Sept. 16), work by recent CalArts 
master of fine arts graduate Thaddeus Strode yields a level of wit and 
brain-teasing complexity seldom seen at this low-profile artists' cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
In his huge "Hexamethalynetetramine" painting, Strode plots big gray-white 
globs in varying shapes and sizes, black spirals and a couple of old-fashioned 
funnies characters atop a loose grid of fat gold and pink stripes. 
</P>
<P>
The reference, of course, is to one of those unpronounceable ingredients of 
modern-day foodstuffs. Strode compresses various tasks in the painting: 
imagining what the molecular components of the chemical would look like under a 
microscope, tacitly comparing this dismal age of over-processed food to the 
never-never land of the funnies pages, and turning the whole thing into a 
purely visual joke on such art-world subjects as pattern painting and 
appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
Another highly involved piece by Strode is "Shangri-la: Self-Portrait, Los 
Angeles Times, New York Times, London Time, Tokyo Time," in which he juxtaposes 
photographs of himself with photos of the Abstract Expressionist painters Mark 
Rothko and Theodore Stamos, and top personnel at Marlborough Gallery in New 
York, adding corny or teasingly allusive "incorrect" captions such as "one of 
TV drama's arch-conspirators." 
</P>
<P>
The viewer needs to know that the execution of Rothko's will (1972-82) provoked 
one of the protracted court cases in modern art. Rothko's daughter Kate brought 
a successful suit against Stamos (one of the estate's executors), Marlborough 
Gallery owner Frank Lloyd and former gallery secretary-treasurer Bernard Reis 
(another executor), accusing them of conspiracy and conflict of interest in 
selling Rothko's works. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Strode's piece, clock hands point to four times, a painting mimics 
the style of Joan Miro and the OCCCA gallery is pinpointed on a Thomas Brothers 
map. The hard-to-decipher ideas here seem to circle around the global nature of 
the contemporary art market, the status of art as an "original" object and the 
artist as media pawn. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is work by Chris Gallup and guest artist Laurie Pincus. In "The 
Notion of Framing Expanded," Gallup creates a fly-by-night sales lot with 
strings of pennants a la car dealership, an array of empty frames in various 
ersatz materials (mock leopard skin to faux marble), and a bunch of slogans 
("One Size Fits All," "Your Art Here"). Unfortunately, the spoof on 
art-as-commodity wears thin long before the viewer has examined all the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Pincus' "Lessons in Life" is a series of paper doll-like figures standing on 
separate little platforms with phrases chalked on little blackboards explaining 
the psychological block each one faces. "Afraid of Her Life" reads the sign 
next to the cut-out woman in the long print dress with her forearm plastered in 
front of her face; the man in a fedora clutching a briefcase is "Leaving His 
Mother for the First Time." This is l-i-t-e stuff, as perky and harmless as a 
TV sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
Other pieces by Pincus chirp about such phenomena as wallflowers at a party, 
personal taste and reactions to art. As conversation pieces for the yuppie set, 
these brightly colored little wooden tableaux are just the ticket. 
</P>

HONDURAN BILLIONAIRE MATTA GUILTY OF RUNNING CALIFORNIA COCAINE RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles jury found Honduran billionaire Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros 
guilty today of operating a California cocaine ring in a decision hailed as a 
powerful message of support for the Colombian government's war on drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending the right message that we want to send to the Colombian 
government, that if they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the 
full extent of the law," said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jimmy 
Gurule. 
</P>
<P>
Matta, 45, was accused of overseeing a network that distributed $72-million 
worth of cocaine in Los Angeles. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
claimed he controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court jury found Matta guilty of one count of conspiracy, one 
count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of possession with 
intent to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Matta's attorney sought to portray the Honduran as a legitimate businessman who 
was the single largest employer in Honduras before his arrest there in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The government argued that Matta was a kingpin of the powerful cocaine cartel 
based in Cali, Colombia, that distributed thousands of kilograms of cocaine to 
Arizona and Southern California through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stemmed from a September, 1981, raid on a Van Nuys apartment 
complex that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine -- at that 
time the largest seizure of the drug in California history.

Los Angeles police are investigating a man suspected of using a razor to slash 
clothing valued at more than $20,000 at several San Fernando Valley department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Augusto Guzman, 38, whose address is unknown, was arrested Saturday on 
suspicion of felony vandalism after security guards at Robinson's department 
store in the Northridge Fashion Center saw him cut several men's suits with a 
razor, Detective Cecil Mixson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mixson said 42 items, including dresses, jackets, shirts and suits worth 
$8,400, were damaged by slashing at the store. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway department store in the same mall reported the same day that 29 
men's suits and 18 leather jackets worth $16,622 were slashed with razors. 
Mixson said he was investigating Guzman's possible involvement in that case and 
similar incidents a few days earlier at the Broadway at the Topanga Plaza 
shopping center in Woodland Hills and other clothing stores in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Mixson said Guzman refused to talk to police and was released after posting 
$5,000 bail. Mixson said he will take evidence in the case to the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office later this week.

A suspect described by police as an "elderly man" was taken into custody 
shortly after the shooting. Initial reports from the scene said the suspect may 
have been a disgruntled retiree. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the man entered the union's offices in downtown 
Detroit shortly after 9 a.m. and argued with a receptionist. Firestone, 54, 
intervened and asked the man to come into his private office.

VAN NUYS MAN SERIOUSLY BURNED IN ACID ATTACK, MOTIVE UNKNOWN

<P>
A man was seriously burned when an assailant threw acid in his face on a street 
in Van Nuys and then stole his car, Los Angeles police said today. No suspect 
has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Chaidez, 22, of Van Nuys suffered chemical burns over his face and 40% 
of his body, police said. He was taken to an undisclosed hospital after being 
found at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday lying on a driveway in the 6900 block of Gloria 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the chemical was unknown but, according to police reports, 
paramedics who treated the victim said he had suffered severe acid burns. 
Police obtained samples for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dennis Dunn said the motive for the attack was unclear. He said a witness 
told police that he thought he saw Chaidez and the assailant arguing shortly 
before the attack. But Chaidez said he did not know his assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Chaidez told police he was sitting in his parked car on Vanowen Avenue near 
Haskell Street when a man carrying a plastic container walked up and asked for 
money so he could buy gasoline for his car, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim said, 'I don't have any money,' and this guy threw a white liquid 
from the container in his face," Dunn said.

BAKKER RULED 'SANE'; TRIAL GOES ON; 
</P>
<P>
HAD PANIC ATTACK ON REALIZATION OF SITUATION, DOCTOR SAYS 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge today ruled Jim Bakker competent to stand trial after a 
psychiatrist testified that the TV evangelist was not mentally ill but merely 
had a panic attack when he finally grasped his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said the fallen evangelist's trial on charges 
of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry will resume later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after a hearing for which Bakker was brought to court from a 
prison psychiatric unit in leg irons and handcuffs. He was committed for a 
psychiatric evaluation there Thursday after his personal psychiatrist reported 
he was hallucinating and cowering in a fetal position under a couch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Competent 
</P>
<P>
During today's hearing, Dr. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist at the Federal 
Correctional Institution at Butner, testified Bakker is competent to stand 
trial and "has the capacity to get through it." 
</P>
<P>
She said Bakker suffered a panic attack last week after a witness collapsed 
during defense cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in three years, the whole situation came home to him, and 
he began to cry," she testified. "The weight of all these things began to 
coalesce, and he began crying. It was a powerful emotional reaction and 
release." 
</P>
<P>
Potter asked Bakker to rise and answer questions before he released him from 
the custody of U.S. marshals. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you understand what you are on trial here for?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," Bakker responded quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, "I'm very tired, but I 
believe I can." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Tammy Faye, said as she left court, "This should not be allowed in 
the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
Potter did not immediately rule on a defense request for a mistrial but said he 
expected the trial to resume later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in a sex and money scandal, 
went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraud charges. Prosecutors said he used 
nearly $4 million in ministry funds to live in high style. 
</P>
<P>
He could receive 120 years in prison and be fined more than $5 million if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker showed little emotion during today's hearing, which was attended by his 
wife and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Faye Bakker arrived with defense attorney George T. Savis shortly after 
her husband this morning and brought him a suit, shirt, tie and shoes. He was 
wearing gray pants and a sport shirt as he entered the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mistrial Request 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Harold Bender filed the mistrial request Tuesday, maintaining 
the jury might blame the defense for the collapse of government witness Steve 
Nelson last week during grilling by Bakker's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she did not detect any signs of mental disease. "It's not abnormal 
for someone to be experiencing those symptoms in a trial situation, especially 
if it comes on the heels of a major disruption in a person's life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She described Bakker's symptoms as "moderate depression" and "situational 
anxiety" and detected "dependent features in his personality" and narcissism.

COLOMBIA DRUG KINGPIN CONVICTED;

A Los Angeles jury found Honduran billionaire Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros 
guilty today of being the absentee overseer of a Van Nuys-based cocaine ring in 
a decision hailed as a powerful message of support for the Colombian 
government's war on drug traffickers.

Matta, 45, was accused of overseeing from Colombia a network that distributed 
$72-million worth of cocaine in Southern California. The U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration claimed he controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court jury found Matta guilty of one count of conspiracy, one

have an extradition treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Police and troops arrested Matta in a predawn raid on his Tegucigalpa home in 
1988 and deported him to the United States by way of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged over the extradition, about 2,000 demonstrators burned the U.S. Embassy 
annex. Five Hondurans died in a week of disturbances.

BUSH DEFENDS DRUG PLAN AGAINST CARPING

<P>
President Bush, embarking on a campaign to sell his $7.9-billion drug program, 
today visited a public hospital to view babies abandoned by addicted mothers 
and defended his plan against "carping" from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"My response is, they're wrong," Bush said of the Democrats' complaints that 
the plan does not go far enough and is inadequately funded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good plan. If people would stop just criticizing for partisan reasons 
and get behind the program, and then if there's something additional we should 
do, then let's do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abandoned Babies 
</P>
<P>
The President met with reporters after paying a visit to D.C. General Hospital, 
where he stopped by a ward of babies abandoned by their crack and cocaine-using 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, wearing a blue smock, quieted one 4 1/2-month-old baby boy by cradling 
him against his shoulder. The infant, one of 13 boarder babies at the hospital, 
beamed at Bush and his health secretary, Dr. Louis Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would take full responsibility for the drug war, Bush replied, 
"I'll take all the responsibility in the world. You see these kids and you want 
to try harder." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the President argued to reporters that his program is $2 billion 
more than the amount being considered by the House. "They're carping," he said 
of his critics, dismissing their objections as "those partisan comments." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he singled out Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the 
House Select Committee on Narcotics, who emerged from a White House briefing on 
drugs Tuesday and declared that Bush would have to raise taxes. The President 
said Rangel "couldn't wait to get out on the lawn of the White House and say, 
'Raise taxes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bush's program calls for tougher penalties on drug users and more money for law 
enforcement, prisons, drug treatment and education. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is criticizing the strategy, no one is coming at us and saying, 'You've 
left this out' or 'Left that out' . . . the country's fed up," Bush said. "They 
don't want it to be a Republican answer or a Democratic answer or a liberal or 
a conservative answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard any real substantive attack on the strategy itself." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was noncommittal when asked about the possibility of establishing an 
international military strike force to combat drug lords, as proposed by Sen. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr.(D-Del.). However, Bush said there was "a lot of interest" 
in such an idea and noted that he had made such a proposal himself during his 
presidential campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he was open-minded about the possibility of sending American 
troops to Colombia, if asked, to help battle the country's drug barons. 
However, he said Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas has made it clear 
that he does not want American troops and that the deployment of U.S. forces 
might anger the population there.

At least 30 East Germans tired of awaiting permission for a mass exodus to the 
West made a risky overnight dash across the Hungarian border into Austria, the 
Red Cross said today. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, West German officials acknowledged they were making little progress in 
changing the minds of Communist East German leaders who intervened with 
Hungarian authorities to block the departure of about 5,500 refugees. As many 
as 20,000 are said to be waiting to leave. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials on Tuesday set up camp outside a tent community in 
Budapest sheltering many of the would-be emigres and began trying to persuade 
them to return to East Germany, only to meet with derision.

The government held a general election today that measured white attitudes 
toward apartheid, specifically a proposal by the governing party to share 
limited power with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised blacks staged a general strike capping 
nationwide protests of the parliamentary election. Factories, businesses, 
schools and transportation services closed down in major cities, where more 
than 90% of black workers and most students stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
Acting President F. W. de Klerk smiled, shook hands and enjoyed a champagne 
breakfast at his Pretoria-area polling booth. Officials say the vote is the 
most crucial since the governing National Party came to power on promises of 
strict race segregation in 1948.

Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, planned to arrive today for 
routine physical examinations at the Mayo Clinic, said Reagan spokesman Mark 
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans have a longstanding relationship with Mayo physicians. Nancy 
Reagan's stepfather, who was a doctor, was a friend of Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a 
retired clinic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, a team of Mayo physicians examined Reagan for any recurrence 
of an earlier colon cancer and they performed surgery to correct an enlarged 
prostate. In October, 1987, two Mayo physicians were part of a team that 
treated Nancy Reagan's breast cancer.

TRUMP NAME WON'T ADORN TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Trump, whose name already adorns two casinos, a Manhattan skyscraper, an 
air shuttle, a bicycle race and a board game, scrapped plans to go video today 
due to a contractural snag, a publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
The billionaire developer was to join Thursday with executives from Lorimar 
Television and Warner Brothers to announce plans for "Trump Card," a new 
television series, but the deal fell through, said Barry Stagg, spokesman for 
Warner Bros. Television. 
</P>
<P>
Stagg said the negotiations would continue, although there would be no 
announcement on the show's status until next week at the earliest.

FACTORY WORKERS LEAD WAY AS U.S. PRODUCTIVITY RISES

<P>
American workers posted a modest productivity improvement in the second quarter 
of the year, with significant gains by factory workers leading the way, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion of the economy 
increased at an annual rate of 0.7% in the April-June period, up from the 0.2% 
gain reported in preliminary data last month and much better than the 1.3% 
decline in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The department said unit labor costs -- a key inflation indicator -- increased 
at an annual rate of 4.9% in the quarter, down from the 6.2% jump reported for 
the first quarter but nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the small productivity gain is consistent with the recent slowing 
of the economy's growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
They also said, however, that poor performance in the non-financial corporate 
sector -- a category, including most service industries, in which productivity 
fell and labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1% annual rate -- suggests that 
inflation was still around. 
</P>
<P>
"The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging" because the 
service-producing sector makes up roughly 80% of the economy, said Allen Sinai, 
chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter improvement occurred because output grew at an annual rate 
of 2.4% and hours worked expanded by 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 
5.6% in the quarter but that consumer inflation continued to more than erase 
the wage gains. Real hourly compensation -- hourly compensation minus consumer 
inflation -- fell 0.7%, the department said.

TRUSTEE APPOINTED TO RUN ALADDIN HOTEL AND CASINO

<P>
The Nevada Gaming Commission appointed a trustee to operate the bankrupt 
Aladdin Hotel and Casino on Tuesday night, three hours before the resort's 
gambling license was due to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency action by the commission allowed the casino at the 1,100-room Las 
Vegas Strip hotel to remain open and continue operations without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member commission named certified public accountant Jack Fidelman as 
trustee, and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Linda Riegle issued the necessary court 
orders after a late-night, cross-town conference call. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dougall, the former president of Del Webb Hotels, and his WDT Co. will 
operate the resort for the trustee. Fidelman and Dougall once worked jointly in 
a similar situation during an 18-month bankruptcy at the Marina Hotel on the 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaming Commission's 9 p.m. vote followed an 11-hour, back-to-back meeting 
of the three-member Gaming Control Board and the commission. Many Aladdin Hotel 
employees attended the all-day meeting. Many were there to protest the actions 
of Robert Brooker, a newly appointed general manager who has cut wages and 
announced layoffs for 400 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The commission action, in effect, ousted Brooker from the $125,000-a-year job 
which he had held only eight days. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning, Brooker admitted that he had been named general manager by 
Ginji Yasuda, after the Japanese businessman no longer held a Nevada gambling 
license at the Aladdin. Yasuda lost his Nevada gambling license by a commission 
vote Aug. 24. Both the commission and the Gaming Control Board unanimously 
agreed at Tuesday's meeting not to extend the license of Yoko Katsumata Yasuda, 
the wife of Ginji Yasuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Yasudas were the first foreign nationals to be licensed by Nevada to 
operate a major gambling resort. The state refused to renew their gambling 
licenses on the grounds that licensing conditions were ignored and that 
financial loans were obtained from questionable sources.

DOW TAKES A 24.89 DIVE AMID QUESTIONS ABOUT FED'S POLICIES

<P>
Stock prices declined broadly today in an atmosphere of uncertainty about the 
outlook for Federal Reserve policy and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.89 points to 2,719.79. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 414 up, 1085 down and 462 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 161.80 million shares, against 145.18 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.66 to 194.18. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a belief is spreading among investors that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to relax its credit policy further any time soon, given a 
stronger-than-expected economy. 
</P>
<P>
"At a minimum, the Fed is not going to provide the fuel to drive the market 
further," said Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said portfolio managers at investing institutions seemed to be in 
a wary mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Institutional money managers have had an exceptionally good year, and they're 
all trying to figure out how to protect their gains. Most of them don't have 
many alternatives other than to sell stocks," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices edged downward in listless early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 
face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased 
to 8.14% from 8.13% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said there was little activity in the absence of market-moving economic 
news. They predicted that prices would continue to drift lower through next 
week, when several pieces of new economic data are to be released. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, bond prices also fell slightly in a post-Labor Day market without 
major influences. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no news to give any direction, and I think things are just weighing 
on the market," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital 
Markets Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said data on August retail sales, inflation and merchandise trade are the 
next major economic barometers scheduled for release, toward the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/4%, up from 8 15/16% late Tuesday.

A federal appeals court today opened the gates to logging of 500 million board 
feet of timber on Bureau of Land Management land in western Oregon despite a 
desperate fight by environmentalists claiming spotted owls would be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had barred logging within two miles of 
known nesting sites of the northern spotted owl while the appeal was pending. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous three-judge panel ruled today that a congressional rider attached 
to an appropriations bill by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) in 1987 precluded 
environmentalists from challenging authorized timber sales on the basis of 
claims that new information showed impacts to wildlife.

Vladimir Krutov will be joining Central Red Army teammate Igor Lirianov in the 
National Hockey League with Vancouver this season, Canucks President Pat Quinn 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Canadian Embassy, Quinn said that the 29-year-old leftwing had 
signed a three-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The signings of Krutov and Lirianov, who agreed to terms earlier this summer, 
give the Canucks two-thirds of the famous KLM line, one of the strongest Soviet 
offensive units. The line, named from the initials of its members, also 
included Sergei Makarov, who will be playing this season with the Stanley 
Cup-champion Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Krutov will leave for Canada as soon as his travel papers are ready, and Quinn 
said he could be in Vancouver before the season begins.

Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini, last year's finalists, took divergent routes 
into the U.S. Open semifinals today. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the top seed and defending champion, needed only 44 minutes to rout No. 8 
Helena Sukova, 6-1, 6-1. It was the 11th straight victory over Sukova for Graf, 
winner of six of the last seven Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, seeded third, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario went more than 44 minutes 
in the first set alone. The baseliners played extended points throughout their 
2-hour, 17-minute match, won by Sabatini 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Graf and Sabatini, who are doubles partners and have reached the semifinals 
here, will meet in Friday's singles semis. No. 2 Martina Navratilova and her 
conqueror in last year's Open, No. 5 Zina Garrison, are in the other semifinal. 
Garrison ended Chris Evert's Grand Slam career on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Am a Machine' 
</P>
<P>
For Graf, it was business as usual. The West German star has lost only 14 games 
in five matches, and she never allowed Sukova to get into their match. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a machine, you know," she joked. "I tried to do my best. If this is the 
outcome against Helena Sukova, 6-1, 6-1, then I should do all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy about the way that I was playing. That's more important than any 
score or time." 
</P>
<P>
Sukova said she was looking for perfection, which was the wrong approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have to play the perfect shot, as I tried to do all of the 
time," she said. "It puts so much pressure on your serve to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it doesn't have to be on the line, it can be a meter from the line, 
and I was certainly pushing it too much, to be a perfect shot, and it didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini had to work hard against Sanchez, the 17-year-old French Open champion 
from Spain. Sabatini's serve was broken four times in the first set. She also 
broke Sanchez twice in the sloppy set. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I started playing a little slow," said Sabatini, who lost to Sanchez 
in their last meeting, at the Canadian Open in August. "I was not moving my 
legs very much. I knew I had to keep in the match with a better forehand and 
attack a little more." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini had 34 unforced errors and only 22 winners.

Police arrested approximately 100 British soccer fans who rampaged through 
downtown Stockholm today before England tied Sweden 0-0 in a World Cup 
qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
The hooligans, many drunk, ran through Stockholm's shopping district shouting, 
slapping passers-by and ripping clothing off sales racks outside stores. Police 
with riot shields gave chase and scuffled with them. 
</P>
<P>
England fans caused riots in Belgium in 1985 and West Germany last year. 
Following the 1985 European Cup final, when Liverpool fans rioting resulted in 
the deaths of 39 fans of the Italian club Juventus of Turin, England's teams 
were banned from playing in European club competitions. The ban did not affect 
the national team and it's due to expire in September 1990. 
</P>
<P>
England moved closer to qualifying for the World Cup with the tie. England, 
which lead Europe Group Two, is 3-0-2 for eight points with one game left. 
Sweden is 2-0-2 for six points followed by Poland, 1-2, and Albania, 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
England has not scored against Sweden in four matches since 1979.

Former world junior welterweight boxing champion Aaron T. Pryor, 34, has 
pleaded innocent to drug charges, saying a cocaine pipe police found in his car 
belongs to a friend who borrowed the vehicle recently. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Pryor late Monday and charged him under a city drug 
paraphernalia ordinance after finding the pipe in the car's seat. Pryor pleaded 
innocent to the charge Tuesday in Hamilton County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, who has a career record of 37-1 with 33 knockouts, was world champion 
from 1980 until 1985. Officials took him off the boxing card Jan. 26 after 
doctors said his left eye was too badly injured to let him fight. Before 
undergoing eye surgery in January, Pryor said he had overcome a cocaine 
addiction that crippled comeback attempts in 1986 and 1987.
