Milton Kagen was tired of dogs relieving themselves in his front yard in the 
Hollywood Hills while the mutts' masters watched placidly. So he posted a sign 
warning that his plants are sprayed with "dioxinleucomaine." And since then, he 
adds, dog owners seem "to be getting the message." 
</P>
<P>
Hold on a minute. Dioxinleucomaine? What's that? (Our computer spell-checker 
nearly burst into flames.) "I made up the word," Kagen proudly admitted.

On 1st Street, not far from the Kosher Burrito stand, a handwritten menu in the 
window of a Japanese restaurant bears the Star of David.

<P>
In our eternal search for truth we came upon an edition of Whole Life Times, a 
sort of New Age magazine. An editorial directed toward men begins: "Dear Male 
Energy Beings . . . " It carries accounts about such feats as accomplishing 
"astral travel while your physical body sleeps" (no more worrying about airline 
rates!). There's also a long profile of a local realtor. That's L.A.: astral 
travel and property values.

Didn't do motorists any good to look back over their shoulders at this freeway

The surfer as artiste: 
</P>
<P>
You may have noticed the article in Wednesday's Calendar section about the 
surfboard art festival that invades Santa Monica later this month. Artists, 
many of whom ride the waves themselves, are decorating the boards to be sold at 
a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be noted that surfers are also sailing into other cultural 
waters. Just the other day, Waveslider Productions released "In a Blue Room," 
billed as the first recording made only by surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope it doesn't give new meaning to the term wipe-out. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would love to experience some of the thrills of surfing without 
leaving their cars, there's always the old carwash-drive-through maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Festival-goers who fork over $15 to the Bonus Carwash in Santa Monica on 
Sept. 15 will receive a cassette of pianist Sandra Tsing Loh's "Music for the 
Bonus Carwash," which they can play while their car is being bathed. 
</P>
<P>
Loh, who once serenaded rush-hour traffic on a piano in a parking lot off the 
Harbor Freeway, terms her carwash recording "exhilarating, abysmal and 
baptismal."

Hot wax is not included.

FINALLY, A DIGNIFIED BURIAL; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 17 YEARS, ALLENDE TAKES HIS PLACE NEXT TO OTHER CHILEAN PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to the military coup that ushered in the rigid rule of Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet, Chile was widely admired in Latin America for its political 
tolerance. That honorable tradition was revived Tuesday when Chileans finally 
gave a dignified burial to Salvador Allende, the democratically elected 
president Pinochet overthrew in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
That was no easy, symbolic gesture for the new government of President Patricio 
Aylwin. For Allende is a controversial figure even in death, and many of the 
men who overthrew him are still alive and still powerful enough to cause 
political problems. Not least among them is Pinochet himself, still the chief 
of Chile's armed forces and publicly unhappy at the decision to hold a formal 
funeral for the late Marxist president. 
</P>
<P>
Allende died in the final hours of fighting around Chile's presidential palace 
in Santiago 17 years ago next week. It is generally believed that he committed 
suicide rather than surrender to Pinochet's forces. He was quietly buried in an 
unmarked grave and his family sent into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Allende's survivors were present when his body was disinterred. They were 
joined by Aylwin and most of his Cabinet for a funeral procession along 
Santiago's widest thoroughfare to a funeral mass in the national cathedral and 
burial in the cemetery where other Chilean presidents are buried. Even the date 
chosen for Allende's funeral was a symbol of reconciliation. Allende's family 
did not choose the anniversary of the coup, but instead the date Allende was 
elected president, Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, admitted with candor and grace 
that he would still oppose Allende's policies if the circumstances were the 
same today as they were 17 years ago. "But the drama lived by Chile since 1973 
has taught us that those circumstances should never repeat themselves," he 
added. "It is the duty of all Chileans to avoid them." It was a fitting tribute 
to a man who -- whatever his faults or mistakes -- devoted his life to 
peaceful, democratic politics.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
LUNGREN'S MURKY AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican candidate Dan Lungren kicked off the race for state attorney general 
with a controversial ad campaign that is murky and exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
The radio and TV commercials accuse Lungren's Democratic opponent, San 
Francisco Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Arlo Smith, of going soft on crime by accepting a plea bargain in a rape and 
drug case involving wealthy businessman Donald E. Werby. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials, which on radio sound like a news report, are misleading in 
their omission of some key facts. Werby was indicted by a grand jury for having 
sex with teen-age prostitutes, dispensing cocaine to minors and attempted 
bribery. The real estate tycoon pleaded guilty to reduced charges and was 
sentenced to three years probation, nine months of community service and 
ordered to pay a $300,000 fine to a program for runaway youths. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's TV ads say, "This, after Werby and his brother had given thousands to 
Smith's political campaign." The implication is the money bought Werby a better 
deal. In fact, Smith returned the money before the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not embarrassed by the ad, but I am sorry there is some 
misinterpretation," Lungren said. The ads now read, "Although Smith returned 
Werby's political contribution, he should have turned the case over to the 
state attorney general because of potential conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's record of plea bargaining and convictions is a legitimate and serious 
issue. Lungren's commercial only trivialized it.

TURNABOUT FOR THE TENANT; 
</P>
<P>
TRAINING TENANTS TO RUN PUBLIC HOUSING MAKES DEBUT IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp returned this week to the Nickerson Gardens housing 
project in Watts to make good on a promise -- tenant management. Kemp, a 
staunch advocate of teaching poor people how to help themselves, kicked off a 
federally funded program that will train tenants to run the public complex like 
a business. 
</P>
<P>
If tenant management works in Los Angeles as in other cities, it can reduce 
vacancies, increase rent collections, provide jobs and save government hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
That certainly was the case at a housing project in Washington, D.C. The 
Kenilworth-Parkside Resident Management Corp. -- led by a charismatic and 
forceful tenants activist, Kimi Gray -- took over the housing project in 1982. 
After three years, an audit reported rent collections had risen by 77%, and the 
vacancy rate had dropped to a mere 5%. By the fourth year of tenant management, 
the government had saved $785,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bertha Gilkey started another tenant management success story at Cochran 
Gardens in St. Louis. Her family moved there 30 years ago when public housing 
was a way out of a slum and an attractive step up for poor families. But public 
housing took on a stigma as the working poor fled drugs, bullets, fear and 
filth. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Gilkey, the Cochran Tenant Management Corp. imposes strict rules: No 
littering, loitering, spitting, walking on the grass or hosting guests longer 
than one month. Infractions produce eviction. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants collect the rent, sweep the hallways, hire maintenance workers -- 
and provide 250 jobs through their catering firm, five day-care centers and 
cable television installation service for poor neighborhoods avoided by the 
traditional cable franchises. Those successes can be duplicated in other 
cities, Gilkey insists. To prove her point, she will run the training program 
at Nickerson Gardens herself. 
</P>
<P>
Public housing is not beyond redemption. Strong tenant management coupled with 
adequate funds can again make it a source of pride.

CONTROVERSY OVER HAYDEN AND 'BIG GREEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am one voter who will try to keep my prejudices from coloring my vote on 
Proposition 128. 
</P>
<P>
What remains of our environment is too precious to allow my personal bias to 
bleach Big Green into Grungy Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I am always suspicious of writers of anonymous letters or of anonymous 
radio advertisements. Are the writers of the advertisements too ashamed to 
acknowledge authorship and to obey the law which requires identification of the 
sponsors of political ads?

CONTROVERSY OVER HAYDEN AND 'BIG GREEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hayden's Proposition 128 is more than 16,000 words long and contains 39 pages 
of mandates, prohibitions, restrictions and new laws that would be forced on 
every Californian. 
</P>
<P>
One section of Proposition 128 reads that "No later than January 1, 1995: Any 
person shall be prohibited from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale or 
use any new motor vehicle . . . if such vehicle contains a vehicular air 
conditioner which uses a Group 1 chemical." 
</P>
<P>
Since Hayden's "Group 1" chemical list includes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) -- 
the primary chemical used in automobile air-conditioning systems -- the 
proposition would result in a substantial portion of new automobiles not being 
equipped with air conditioners. And there's nothing -- not even on the drawing 
board -- that could replace CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 128 passes and you plan on buying a new car five years from now, 
be prepared to sweat a lot!

<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the Hayden initiative, Proposition 128, I have come to the 
conclusion that too many complex and important subjects are thrown together in 
this one measure. 
</P>
<P>
Once the thoughtful voter sifts through the 16,000-word document, it becomes 
painfully clear that matters such as saving our redwood trees, food safety, the 
greenhouse effect on the entire planet, carbon dioxide emissions, car and home 
air-conditioning systems, water-quality standards and energy supplies cannot be 
addressed in a single initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when one realizes that the $3-billion price tag attached to Hayden's 
initiative will be placed on the backs of the taxpayers of California, the 
voter really has to be alarmed.

After only a month as chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, William F. 
O'Connor is not sure whether he wants to remain at the helm of the world's 
largest futures exchange. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, 55, said he hasn't decided whether he wants to serve beyond January, 
when his term expires. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was appointed chairman July 31 when Karsten (Cash) Mahlmann resigned 
amid financial woes at Stotler Group Inc., a futures brokerage firm of which he 
was also chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran for election for vice chairman, and I became chairman by a means which I 
didn't want to become chairman," O'Connor said. "I still don't know if I want 
to be chairman."

An Arizona businessman received almost $2 billion in government subsidies, 
through the lobbying efforts of a former aide to President Bush, to invest in a 
savings and loan institution. 
</P>
<P>
The same businessman was also able to buy a bank in Oklahoma, despite his 
failure to meet federal standards. He did this with a personal investment of 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure the question you're asking is, how does anyone manage to get a deal 
like that? 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, a lot of it involves friendship -- or one man's love for 
another. I'm not talking about homosexual love, but rather the love someone has 
for a person who attended the same school, or who served in the same outfit in 
the armed services, or who belongs to the same country club. 
</P>
<P>
It is this bonding that's responsible for billions of dollars flying out the 
window and ending up on the taxpayers' floor. 
</P>
<P>
Let me give you an illustration: Winterbottom has always had his heart set on 
buying an S&amp;L. So he calls up Duquesne, his old roommate from Dancy Tech, 
who happens to be a consultant in Washington with reputed connections to the 
Lincoln Room in the White House. Winterbottom says: "I'd like to strike it rich 
by purchasing an S&amp;L, and I thought that for old times' sake, you could 
help me out. I am willing to put up $14.50 of my own money so the government 
regulators know I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
Duquesne replies: "I'd be happy to help you acquire an S&amp;L. You are a good 
friend of mine, and the people I'll be talking to are also good friends of 
mine. That's the beauty of the consulting business -- you only deal with 
friends. Of course, if you get the bank, I hope that I can borrow a few bucks 
when I need them." 
</P>
<P>
Winterbottom asks: "How much?" 
</P>
<P>
"Eight or $9 million. I'll put up my tennis racquet as collateral." 
</P>
<P>
Winterbottom responds: "I don't see any problem with that kind of loan. How are 
you going to arrange for me to get my bank?" 
</P>
<P>
"First, I'll go to the FDIC and talk to Scooter. You remember Scooter. He 
played halfback at Dancy the year we went there. I'll tell him that one of our 
boys needs an S&amp;L in the worst way, and if he doesn't come up with a bank, 
he has made a mockery of our friendship." 
</P>
<P>
"Will that be persuasive enough?" Winterbottom wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
Duquesne assures him it will. "Scooter owes me one. I treated him and his wife 
to a trip to Paris on the Concorde. What's more, I'm taking him duck shooting 
for Thanksgiving. When it comes to S&amp;Ls, Scooter is like my brother." 
</P>
<P>
"When do you think Scooter will give me an S&amp;L?" 
</P>
<P>
"He can't give you one. He can only recommend that you get one from Hogarth, 
who also happens to be a good friend of mine. Hogarth and I are in the same 
PTA, so he trusts me. He can't actually give you one, either, but he can make 
sure that no one sits on your application." 
</P>
<P>
Winterbottom declares: "I didn't know that acquiring one lousy S&amp;L involved 
so much work." 
</P>
<P>
Duquesne says: "It's not a lot of work, but you have to touch a lot of bases. 
That's what consultants do. Washington hates dealing with people it doesn't 
know."

Again, and violently: the contemporary literary style of subordinating reality 
to the words used in presenting. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy, narrator of "The Lives of the Dead," is a filmmaker whose sadistic noir 
spectacles depict such atrocities as a man hanging a woman by piano wire or 
burning his children to death in a field. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy tells us about these films. Mostly, though, he tells us about a new film 
for which he is trying to raise money. Its protagonist is D'Nel, a figure of 
pure evil, who goes around the country killing families with the help of Molly, 
a zombielike beauty, and Banty, a pallid character who trains dolphins and is 
dragged in because he hopes to rescue Molly. 
</P>
<P>
These films are Buddy's fictions. When he tells us about making them, when he 
tells us about his money troubles, his ex-wife Bess, his second (and future 
ex-) wife Celest, he seems to be telling us about his life. Except that he 
isn't. Is a first-person narrative an account of reality, or is it, itself, a 
more or less arbitrary fiction? Arbitrarily, for example, Celest lacks her 
final "e." 
</P>
<P>
In his garish, gory and chokingly overwrought novel, Charlie Smith melts down 
the distinctions to create an airless world of helpless evil. It is the oddly 
theological evil that consists of absence -- traditionally, an absence of good; 
here, an absence of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is evoking the oozy, phantasmagoric mentality that some believe is 
created by constant high-powered doses of television and pop culture -- 
children who feel that killing is no more or less real than what happens in the 
movies, and just might act accordingly. His filmmaker fuses bit by bit with his 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lives of the Dead" starts out more or less conventionally, with Buddy 
telling us about scouting sites for his film along the Gulf Coast. But the 
narration is oddly fevered and hyped-up. "You're going to love this," he tells 
his producer over the phone, and proceeds to relate the entirely unlovable 
story of how D'Nel and his party massacre an old couple. 
</P>
<P>
And his own encounters along the way seem to take place in a gangrenous 
lighting worthy of David Lynch. Stopping at a diner, he gets whacked in the 
face by a spatula; he drops the whacker -- the cook -- with a blow to his 
chest. On the road, he sees one man beat another with an ax handle, possibly to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
He delivers a lofty, posturing tirade about his love for ordinary people: "I 
have never been offended by the antics and enthusiasm of tourists; on the 
contrary, I enjoy their dumb questions, their amazed or worn-out faces, their 
relentless adventurism. They are a comfort to one who has felt always, outside 
of the studio or the movie house, that the world was a baffling, glorious, 
terrifying place." 
</P>
<P>
Music-video speech; speech used not to say something but to strike an attitude 
that sabotages itself as soon as struck. Already, Buddy is fabricating himself 
as he fabricates one of his movies. He is turning into his horror-film hero. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy is on his way to try to raise money from Bess, who runs a flourishing 
vegetable and tobacco farm. She is an Earth-mother figure -- forthright, 
energetic, real. Except that her reality is excessive; the family dinner she 
gives, with uncles, cousins, lots of gristly down-home talk, and acres of pork 
chops and banana pudding, is as overdone as a Deep South movie scene. 
</P>
<P>
Reality and film bleed into each other. When Buddy recalls caressing his 
daughter, he thinks of himself as a camera scanning her face. He is so 
de-natured that instead of having sex with Celest, they conduct detailed 
masturbatory talks over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
And bit by bit, the awful adventures of D'Nel, Molly and Banty become Buddy's 
own life. When Bess left him years before, he had slashed her arm in an attempt 
to kill her; later, the scar on her arm serves to excite him and draw him back. 
And as D'Nel begins a climactic orgy of murder -- he even kills Banty's 
dolphins, the symbols of innocence -- Buddy himself turns into a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
It was not, he tells us at the end, "to press the silly point that the 
possibility of D'Nel Boyd lives in all of us that I had thrown my life away for 
a movie, it was simply to make it possible, or to show it possible, that such a 
one could exist, that such a one -- this frank murderer -- does breathe, here 
on earth . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Film and fiction do not exist to distill the reality of life, in other words. 
Life exists to distill fictions. Buddy's film is not there to show us how to 
believe in evil. Buddy becomes evil to make us believe his film. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, "The Lives of the Dead" does provide in the traditional way a 
vivid statement about contemporary reality: We have sacrificed it to our pop 
images. But with its sabotaged characters impaled upon Smith's symbolic 
exclamation points, it manages to do more or less what Buddy does. It throws 
away its life to make its fictional statement.

LEGAL VIEW: AVOIDING A CONTEST OF WILLS WITHIN THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN and LOUIS M. BROWN, Klein is an attorney and assistant to 
the publisher of The Times. Brown is professor of law emeritus at USC and 
chairman of the board for the National Center for Preventive Law.

<P>
What happens when your inheritance is not what you expected? If it is 
surprisingly large, you have nothing to complain about, presumably. But what if 
another person, perhaps a relative, inherits what you thought you deserved? 
</P>
<P>
If the slight is serious, you may be in for a will contest. And it won't be 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when a will is contested? The person contesting the will must 
prove that the decedent -- the dead person -- was under "duress, menace, fraud 
or undue influence" when the will was signed. That's not easy to do. 
</P>
<P>
A court will determine the state of mind of the decedent and other 
circumstances surrounding the signing of the will. 
</P>
<P>
But there are ways to maintain family harmony and minimize the risk that 
someone will contest your will. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers who prepare wills usually include a "no contest" clause. It provides 
that if a beneficiary challenges the will and loses, he is given nothing or a 
small amount. In other words, if you believe someone may challenge the will, 
you leave that person a sum of money to "buy them off," an amount they will 
lose if they contest the will. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, contestants usually think twice (or more times) 
before seeking to defeat a will. Of course, it works as a deterrent only if the 
amount set aside is large enough to persuade the person not to risk a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to protect your will is to plan for a contest before you die. In a 
will contest, psychiatrists, psychologists and other experts usually testify 
about undue influence, duress, fraud and mental stability. 
</P>
<P>
If you consult such a professional about the time you sign the will, and he or 
she is satisfied with your mental capacity, then you have an expert witness if 
the will is contested. 
</P>
<P>
Another but not fail-safe technique involves making a videotape of the signing 
of the will. It may be difficult to have the videotape introduced into 
evidence, and the tape may be suspect if it seems too artificial. 
</P>
<P>
One legal procedure, known as declaratory relief, allows parties to a current 
dispute to have a court rule on future obligations or rights under a written 
contract. Three states -- North Dakota, Ohio and Arkansas -- have broadened the 
concept to allow for a court declaration of the validity of a will during one's 
lifetime. But the procedure is rare, according to a recent law review article. 
</P>
<P>
Another recommendation is to sign successive wills. Say, for example, a will is 
signed in 1988 and another in 1989. If the 1989 will is successfully attacked, 
the 1988 will becomes the operational one. And so on. The process of successive 
wills does not require that any new law be passed. It should, however, be used 
with some discretion and upon the advice of personal legal counsel.

YOUR WHEELS: FLUID WON'T CURE WHAT AILS CLUTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently had to replace the master cylinder for the clutch on my 
1987 Toyota Corolla FX. At the time, the car had only 15,000 miles on it, since 
I live only four blocks from my job. The problem was that I could not put the 
transmission in gear. How do I know that I really needed a $100 master cylinder 
rather than just the addition of some more fluid? -- D.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Since the system is a closed loop, any loss of fluid means that you 
have a leak and therefore a malfunction. Adding fluid may have temporarily 
fixed the problem, but fluid would continue to leak and, probably, at an 
accelerated rate. 
</P>
<P>
The entire hydraulic system is what connects your clutch pedal to the clutch, 
replacing older systems that used a simple cable. The hydraulic system has some 
mechanical advantages over a cable, but they can be quite a bit more expensive 
to repair, as you have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The failure in your system occurred much too soon to be the result of normal 
wear on the part. It most likely occurred because the fluid became contaminated 
with a substance that ruined the rubber seals and allowed a leak to occur. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent culprit in such cases is motor oil that is added to brake fluid. 
This may have occurred in the factory, but it more likely happened during 
servicing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently paid several hundred dollars to replace the struts on my 1988 
Nissan Sentra. What exactly are struts? Why did they fail with only 40,000 
miles on the car? -- A.T. 
</P>
<P>
A: Struts perform the same job as shock absorbers, but they are called struts 
because they are integrated into the springs and suspension system on either 
the front or rear of the car. 
</P>
<P>
The struts dampen road shocks. The strut's main part is a piston that is 
restricted in its movement by oil that must be displaced by the piston, similar 
to the action of an old-fashioned butter churn. 
</P>
<P>
The piston is connected to a rod that runs outside the strut through a rubber 
O-ring. This is typically where the strut fails, because once the O-ring allows 
oil to leak, the strut will no longer be capable of dampening road shocks. 
</P>
<P>
When a mechanic inspects a strut, he often looks for signs of leaking oil, but 
the simple existence of some oil on the strut does not warrant its replacement. 
Rather, enough oil must have leaked to degrade the performance of the strut. 
There might, for example, be signs of wear on your tires. The car will bounce 
excessively in driving. 
</P>
<P>
Struts often deteriorate slowly over a long period of time. When a mechanic 
advises replacement, ask him why he is making his recommendation. Ask if there 
are signs of uneven tire wear. 
</P>
<P>
Struts often fail prematurely if they are exposed to harsh driving conditions, 
such as dusty roads, extreme cold and harsh surfaces. If you drive in a warm 
climate with good roads, struts can last quite long, even more than 100,000 
miles.

Mapplethorpe Complaints Denied: Opponents of a Robert Mapplethorpe photo 
exhibit lost a bid Wednesday in a Boston court to halt the show they say 
violates obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three complaints against the 
exhibit by the American Family Assn., which would have prompted an 
investigation by the district attorney. The group had sought a ruling that the 
exhibit -- which includes nude photographs of children -- is exploitative, 
constitutes dissemination of obscene materials and matter harmful to minors. 
The complaints had been filed against the Institute of Contemporary Art, which 
opened the Mapplethorpe exhibit five weeks ago. BETH KLEID

Two Jobs for Dutoit: Charles Dutoit, the artistic director of the Montreal 
Symphony Orchestra, said Tuesday in Montreal that he has accepted an invitation 
to lead l'Orchestre National de France at the same time. When he extended his 
contract in May with the Montreal symphony until 1993, Dutoit said he wanted to 
conduct a European orchestra concurrently. The Swiss-born conductor will be in 
charge of the French orchestra's musical programming beginning this month and 
will conduct it for 12 weeks a year from 1992-95. BETH KLEID

'NATIVE DANCE' AT SUNSET CANYON CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By staging "Native Dance of North America" in two separated outdoor areas of 
the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Festival denied 
its audience a fixed, passive perspective. Some parts of the program were 
sequential, others simultaneous -- so you had to choose, to keep moving, to get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The program emphasized the diversity of Native American dance, ranging from the 
surging spatial freedom of the Ikooc from Southern Mexico to the weighty 
rootedness of the King Island Inupiat from Alaska. Sometimes the focus narrowed 
to a simple two-step, such as the one taught the audience by the Cahuilla Bird 
Singers from California. Elsewhere, it expanded to encompass the intricate, 
buoyant footwork executed by the Jemez Pueblo Turquoise clan from New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Accompaniments varied, too: violin and guitar in the Jemez Matachina ritual, 
large tambourine-like drums and voice for the Inupiat, gourds for the Cahuilla 
singers, flute and bells (plus percussion) for the Ikooc. 
</P>
<P>
Such differences eventually helped you appreciate issues drawing the groups 
together: performance as a family matter, for example. Celebrating the natural 
world (especially animals). Using song and dance to safeguard the continuity of 
a culture. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying life-size wooden replicas of swordfish, the Ikooc swooped across open 
lawn looking joyously connected to their environment -- and perfectly placed 
against a backdrop of pines and a full moon. In the same space later on, the 
Jemez Matachina ceremony made a statement about nurturing innocence and 
neutralizing savagery -- but lightly, within vivacious group dances revealing 
stylistic links to both Spain and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In a more conventional setting (amphitheater seating, a slab stage backed with 
banners), the six Cahuilla men shared the creation and migration lore of their 
people through excerpts from song cycles that can last the whole night. Later, 
the Inupiat offered a survey of their traditions -- games, crafts, performance 
-- with women prominent for the first time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the sight of Inupiat women patting the air with gloved hands and 
bobbing in place, while their men did a punching, stamping version of the same 
movement, provided one of the most telling contrasts in an evening teeming with 
them.

Sure, there are plenty of reggae-style Led Zeppelin tribute bands fronted by 
Elvis impersonators, but there's a reason why Dread Zeppelin is the one with a 
recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace on Tuesday, the six-man band (plus singer Tortelvis' omnipresent 
towel- and water-boy) stretched one joke into more than an hour of fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Zeppelin songs that make up most of Dread Zeppelin's live repertoire (as 
well as its new album "Un-Led-Ed") retain their name, but they sure don't 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
From a medley of "Black Dog" and "Hound Dog" -- complete with canned barks -- 
to an elaborate, toasted "Stairway to Heaven," the group twisted the sacred 
classics into laugh-inducing caricatures, placing heavy emphasis on guitar 
excess and Tortelvis' Vegas song stylings. 
</P>
<P>
But for all their cleverness, such parodies might grow tiresome if it weren't 
for the group's visual appeal. 
</P>
<P>
A "Gilligan's Island"-meets-"Blue Hawaii" stage set provided a suitably skewed 
backdrop for the wildly attired band, whose members range from the dreadlocked, 
caftan-clad Ed Zeppelin on percussion to bassist Put-Mon, who on Tuesday 
sported a barely-there bathing suit. Tortelvis himself was resplendent in an 
electric blue jumpsuit anchored by a freeway-wide white belt. Funniest of all 
was the interplay between Tortelvis and his surly valet, who never failed to 
interrupt a performance in order to comb the ersatz King's hair. 
</P>
<P>
Dread Zeppelin is a labor of a whole lotta love, but you don't have to work 
hard to appreciate the results. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

S.D. SHIP HEADS FOR GULF AMID SEA OF ANXIETY

"When they push the ship away from the pier, it's like they cut the world in 
half. And they did -- they cut my world in half," said Karen Powell, her tears 
falling onto the 6-month-old baby in her arms as the destroyer tender Acadia 
set out Wednesday for the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia's departure from the 32nd Street Naval Station was a painful one for 
the families left behind on the dock. Its crew is the first on a San 
Diego-based vessel to sail knowing it would join Operation Desert Shield 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, a 30-year-old substitute teacher and mother of two, stood on Pier 7 
waving to her husband, Norman, who clutched his binoculars and stood sandwiched 
between rows of sailors. As the 20,000-ton repair ship moved away from the 
dock, Powell held her infant up above her head. 
</P>
<P>
"When they remove the brow, you feel so helpless," said Powell, whose husband 
has served 12 years in the Navy. "There's nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Acadia's 10 a.m. departure, the pier was crowded with couples 
clutching one another and children crying. When the lumbering ship began to 
move, a hush fell over the dock. 
</P>
<P>
One lone sailor ran toward the vessel -- sea bag in hand -- with his wife, 
three small children, and a supervising officer in tow. Too late to stop the 
ship, officers hurriedly summoned a tug boat, dubbed "Mister Randy," to ferry 
Petty Officer 1st Class Crescenio Corotan to the Acadia. 
</P>
<P>
Corotan, a laboratory technician, was not initially scheduled to be on the crew 
for this deployment. But, because his replacement failed to report for duty, 
Corotan was informed Tuesday that he would have to ship out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy because he wasn't going. Now it's all this rush and he didn't 
have time to pack," said his wife as she cried quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos erupted on the dock behind her. Husbands and wives of crew members 
yelled; some waved signs. As Barrie Leonard clutched her 6-month-old baby, her 
other son, Kenneth, 6, bawled: "Daddy! Daddy! Don't leave me!" 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia will not be deployed to an area where heavy fighting is anticipated, 
since it is a repair vessel with little ability to defend itself. For the 
families gathered on the pier, this fact proved some consolation. 
</P>
<P>
While many were accustomed to routine six-month deployments, this departure was 
different and the possible dangers seemed very real. 
</P>
<P>
"I get this fear -- I am afraid I won't be seeing my husband anymore, that this 
is the last time I see anybody," said April Adamson, 19, a sailor whose husband 
stayed ashore. "If anyone wants to get me, they better get me fast because I 
don't want to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Adamson is one of the 300 women in the Acadia's crew; there are 900 men. Though 
law prohibits women from participating in combat, they can serve out of the 
line of fire. Currently, 460 women sailors are deployed aboard vessels 
participating in Operation Desert Shield. And so, the pier was crowded both men 
and women who were left behind to take care of the children. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be done," shrugged Chris Faith, a shipping clerk who bid goodby to 
his wife and walked hand-in-hand with his 7-year-old son and 4-year-old 
daughter. Faith, like others, figures his wife will probably be gone for six 
months but every family realizes it could be longer. 
</P>
<P>
Six San Diego-based vessels are currently participating in Operation Desert 
Shield, but these ships were already in the region when Iraq invaded Kuwait, 
precipitating the U.S. military buildup. The Acadia is the first to leave the 
city, sailing toward the Persian Gulf. Sending the Acadia, which should take 
several weeks to arrive in the region, suggests that the United States is 
hunkering down for the long haul, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure signals that we intend to keep our destroyers in the Persian Gulf a 
long time," said retired Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, director of the Center 
for Defense Information in Washington. "The indication is clear that ships 
there intend to stay at least five months otherwise they wouldn't need the 
services of a tender." 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia, commissioned in 1981, has been to the Persian Gulf before. The ship 
assisted the frigate Stark when it was hit by an Iraqi missile in 1987 during 
the Iraq-Iran war. 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia was originally expected to leave port in January. But because of 
escalating tension in the Mideast, that departure was moved up to September. 
And many families, though they learned the schedule change a month ago, felt 
the crunch of preparing for a six-month departure with relatively short notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am still in shock," said Kaye Hunter, ombudsman for the ship, who 
clutched the hand of her husband, John, minutes before he boarded the vessel. 
But the Hunters' 13-year-old son was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to see my grandparents in New Mexico, this was going to be our 
second Christmas together -- everything is shot," said John William Hunt, 
gazing at his father. "Every time something good is happening, my dad is always 
leaving."

PLAN TO WIDEN I-5 NEAR DEL MAR HITS A ROADBLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission's staff, fearing environmental damage, has 
recommended that the full commission reject proposals to widen Interstate 5 
near Del Mar and build an east-west freeway linking Del Mar and Rancho 
Penasquitos. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation drew an angry response Wednesday from Jack Grasberger, chief 
deputy district director of the state Department of Transportation, who said 
the $160 million in highway projects are "vital to future transportation needs 
in the region." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Caltrans will fight the recommendation when the commission meets 
Sept. 13 to hear the issue. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Caltrans planners proposed widening Interstate 5 north of its 
junction with Interstate 805 to beyond Del Mar Heights Road and building a 
portion of Route 56, which eventually would link inland Interstate 15 with I-5 
at Carmel Valley. The projects must win commission approval to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lee, regional coastal program manager for the commission, said the 
staff's recommendation to reject both projects was based on Caltrans' "failure 
to consider all alternatives" for the major freeways, including ones that would 
not intrude on Penasquitos Lagoon, the Carmel Valley wetlands and other 
sensitive coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just not convinced that they (the City of San Diego and Caltrans) have 
explored all feasible alternatives to these routes," Lee said. "And, if there 
is to be destruction of sensitive wetlands and riparian habitat, we want a 
great deal more than they are proposing in mitigation," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Grasberger said he was "very disappointed" with the recommendation and called 
Caltrans' proposal to create a 110-acre open space in Carmel Valley east of I-5 
a factor that far outweighs any environmental damage from the highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the money, and we have the approval from (the state Department of) 
Fish and Game and a number of other agencies," the Caltrans official said, 
lamenting the commission staff's sudden action. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for widening I-5 north of the I-5/I-805 junction from its existing 
eight lanes to 17 to 19 lanes in a dual freeway system that would include an 
interchange with Route 56, which eventually will provide a six-lane freeway 
link east from the coast to I-15. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.5-mile I-5 widening project would extend into about 35 to 50 acres of 
river and coastal habitat. The commission staff recommends that that loss be 
offset by requiring 150 to 200 acres of replacement habitat, plus "aesthetic 
and environmental amenities" to make the freeways and the areas around them 
"much more pleasing to the eye," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer said she stands firmly in favor of 
the Route 56 east-west linkage, but opposed to the I-5 widening, which, she 
said, "simply is not needed and would just create a traffic jam somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
She said she will appear at the commission meeting in Marina del Rey to ask 
commissioners to sever the two projects, approving Route 56 and turning down 
the I-5 widening. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected at the hearing are groups from inland communities of Poway, 
Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Penasquitos and Carmel Mountain Ranch that favor 
construction of the cross-county link to the coast, and Carmel Valley Coalition 
members from North City West and Del Mar Heights who seek to have Route 56 
detoured to the south to avoid their coastal communities and the Penasquitos 
Lagoon area.

ARSON BLAMED FOR 5-ACRE BRUSH FIRE NEAR I-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire investigators said a 5-acre brush fire near the on-ramp of Interstate 8 
near Mission Gorge Road Tuesday was arson and started by a incendiary device 
found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators would not release any details about what kind of fire-setting 
device was used. 
</P>
<P>
"If I tell you, then everybody will dream up the same device," said Detective 
John Buono, a fire investigator with the Metro Arson Strike Team. 
</P>
<P>
No homes were damaged in the fire, which firefighters contained in about 90 
minutes. Investigators believe the blaze may be related to a slew of other 
brush fires that have been set around the city and the county over the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of other fires in the past five or six years adjacent to 
freeways," Buono said. 
</P>
<P>
Buono did not have figures on exactly how many fires have been set, referring 
to the incidents as the roadside series. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that they are related to the same person, but it's hard to determine 
that," Buono said. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The fires are similar in that an incendiary device is usually used, they are 
usually set near a freeway and usually in an area where there are homes that 
might be threatened, Buono said. 
</P>
<P>
About four years ago, Buono said, there was a fire near I-8 about a block from 
where Tuesday's fire was set. 
</P>
<P>
No incendiary device was found at the time, but Buono said that is not uncommon 
for arson-set brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be devices, (we) just couldn't find them," Buono said.

YOUTH DENIES ROLE IN BORDER ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old arrested last week on suspicion of robbing undocumented 
immigrants near the border denied the allegations at a hearing Wednesday in 
Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Napoleon A. Jones Jr. ordered Jason MacAllister to remain in custody 
pending further court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Trial is scheduled Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney has petitioned the court to try him as an adult because 
of the seriousness of the offense and his age," said Carlos Armour, a deputy 
district attorney and chief of that office's juvenile division. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister and three adult males were arrested by San Diego police and U.S. 
Border Patrol agents just north of the U.S.-Mexico border last Thursday. Eleven 
people, 10 of them illegal aliens, told officials they were robbed by four 
males with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister's attorney, Leif Tessem, denied the charges against his client: 
eight counts of robbery and three counts of attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The three other suspects have already pleaded not guilty in Municipal Court to 
seven counts of armed robbery and four counts of attempted robbery. They are 
being held in County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
The three are William Eugene Barnes, 24; Donald Tyrone Young, 22, and Ruben 
Augustine Saucedo, 20. A preliminary hearing has been set for Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
All four suspects are students at the San Diego Job Corps Center on Iris Avenue 
in Imperial Beach.

BURBANK TO LIMIT GROWTH IN MEDIA AREA; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SOME CALL THE HIGH-RISE PLAN ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WHILE OTHERS SAY IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After five years of study and debate, Burbank city officials Wednesday outlined 
a plan to control growth in the city's Media District, fast emerging as one of 
the country's largest centers of entertainment-oriented industries. 
</P>
<P>
Although city and studio officials called the Media District Specific Plan one 
of the most restrictive in Southern California, homeowners complained that it 
does not do enough to control the encroachment of commercial and industrial 
development into their neighborhoods -- resurrecting the disagreements that 
have kept the plan tied up in hearings since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Home to such studios as Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC, the Media District 
grew largely uncontrolled during the early 1980s, transforming the often 
joked-about but virtually non-existent "Beautiful Downtown Burbank" into an 
attractive commercial strip. The district's glass-and-steel high-rise office 
buildings each day attract about 20,000 people employed by the studios and 
other entertainment businesses that straddle the Ventura Freeway in southwest 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth has been felt by residents of nearby neighborhoods. Their quiet, 
tree-lined streets have become virtual freeways during rush hour, and tall 
buildings have decimated the country-like atmosphere of upper-middle-class 
neighborhoods such as Toluca Lake and the Burbank Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
"During the early 1980s, there was a tremendous influx of high-density, 
high-rise office buildings," City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom said. "Quite 
frankly, not enough thought was given to the cumulative effects of all those 
buildings combined." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council later this fall, the Media District Specific 
Plan will become the blueprint for future development on the 557 acres in the 
southwest corner of Burbank. The plan would impose height limits, density 
restrictions and design standards on new construction and would seek to protect 
nearby residential neighborhoods from commercial and industrial intrusion. It 
would encourage the use of alternative transportation and would require 
companies to reduce by 38% the auto traffic they generate over the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the plan would encourage enough growth to keep the 
district an attractive location for the studios and other 
entertainment-oriented industries that are its largest tenants. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, faced with the departure of Lockheed Corp., have taken an 
active role in making the city attractive to business, a sore point with some 
homeowners who claim that they are being sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents interviewed Wednesday complained that the plan is not 
restrictive enough. They said the city's plans for the Media District pay lip 
service to controlling development, but actually will increase traffic to 
gridlock levels and destroy the surrounding neighborhoods of single-family 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really a placebo to make everyone feel good," homeowner Robert Olson 
said of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
City and studio officials acknowledged that the plan, hammered out during five 
years of hearings, is less than perfect. It is the best compromise between the 
needs of business looking to expand and the concerns of homeowners wanting to 
protect their quiet streets, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best plan we could hope for because no one is ecstatic about it," 
said Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate and facilities planning for 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The plan seeks to unite the different elements of the district, which is 
dissected by the Ventura Freeway and lies roughly between Buena Vista Street 
and Clybourn Avenue. Commercial construction would line Olive Avenue from the 
middle of the district -- known as Media Center and located between Hollywood 
Way, Alameda and Olive avenues, California Street and the Ventura Freeway. 
Industrial uses would be reserved for the studio lots. Peppered throughout are 
several apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian traffic would be encouraged throughout the district with the 
construction of plazas. City planners especially want to maintain heavy 
pedestrian use of Riverside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would impose a height limit of 205 feet on new construction that 
receives a conditional-use permit. Buildings without a conditional-use permit 
would be under 35 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan would limit the floor area ratio of new construction. For 
example, an 11,000-square-foot building could be built on a 10,000-square-foot 
lot. However, denser projects would be allowed near Media Center. Even so, a 
building similar to the Tower-Burbank, which has a floor area seven times 
larger than the property on which it sits, would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Studios would also be impacted, but some officials said Wednesday that the 
plan's publication will allow them to proceed with projects that have been put 
on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Epstein, vice president of Disney Development Co., said all Disney 
projects in Burbank have been delayed for five years as the company waited to 
find out what restrictions the plan would impose. O'Neill said NBC has delayed 
development of its 800,000-square-foot NBC Plaza for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strike a balance between the needs of business and the concerns 
of residents, the plan includes a neighborhood protection plan intended to 
preserve nearby residential streets that are not formally within the boundaries 
of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Several would be barricaded to create cul-de-sacs that would divert drivers 
looking for shortcuts to Olive and Alameda avenues and Riverside Drive. Traffic 
on some residential streets has increased threefold in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Council meeting last month, about 50 residents applauded the plan to 
barricade their streets. Many said they have been afraid to let pets and 
children play outside for fear that they would be hit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, office buildings within the Media District would be required to 
stairstep away from residential neighborhoods. For instance, buildings within 
50 feet of a single-family house must be under 25 feet high, while buildings 
150 feet away could be up to 35 feet.

COUNCIL OKS 8-MONTH TRIAL WITH PRIVATE AMBULANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to cut costs and improve emergency response time, the Los Angeles City 
Council on Wednesday approved a pilot program under which private ambulance 
firms would supplement city paramedic services in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-month program, about 4,000 patients in the Valley whose lives 
are not in danger will be transported to hospitals by private ambulances, city 
Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department dispatchers will continue to send a paramedic van, ambulance or 
fire truck on all emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene, crews will decide whether the patient should be transported to a 
hospital by city paramedics or private ambulance, which would be used if the 
injury or malady is not considered serious. 
</P>
<P>
For example, people with broken limbs or cuts and bruises would be candidates 
for transport by private ambulance, Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Dean Cathey said if the pilot program works in the Valley, the 
department will seek council permission to expand it citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Cathey said emergency calls are increasing about 6% a year in Los Angeles, 
forcing the department to add about three new paramedic teams each year. 
</P>
<P>
The department is hoping that transferring some of the work to private 
ambulance firms will lower costs and simultaneously improve emergency response 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Average response time on emergency calls is 4 1/2 minutes citywide and 5 
minutes in the Valley, Cathey said, adding that crews have to travel farther in 
the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Private ambulance firms will bill patients directly, using rates approved by 
the city that are virtually identical to those charged by the department, 
Cathey said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical five-mile trip to a hospital costs about $150, varying slightly 
depending upon the time of day and waiting time, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program met with an enthusiastic response from the council members, 
who considered it a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time I was an ardent advocate of having paramedics do everything," 
Councilman Marvin Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
But with the level of service threatened by rising costs, Braude said he 
commended the department for the "judicious manner" in which the pilot program 
was developed. 
</P>
<P>
The idea arose during a city administrative office audit of the department, 
fire officials said. That audit showed that paramedics were busy handling less 
urgent calls, which slowed their response to life-threatening calls. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be open to all city-licensed ambulance companies willing to 
operate in the Valley.

EX-DEPUTY WHO KILLED WIFE GETS 13-YEAR TERM; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: ANTHONY MICHAEL SCALZO RECEIVES THE MAXIMUM PRISON SENTENCE. HE BLAMED 
THE 1989 SHOOTING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HE HAD BEEN TAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who claimed he was under the 
influence of a sleeping pill when he shot and killed his wife was sentenced 
Wednesday to 13 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Michael Scalzo, 51, said he was under the influence of a prescription 
drug called Halcion when he shot his wife, Joan, 44, in the right cheek. After 
hearing her scream for help, he shot her again in the right ear, according to 
testimony. She died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred on Feb. 20, 1989, as the couple was in the process of 
divorcing after 23 years of marriage, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzo's attorney, Howard R. Price of Beverly Hills, argued that Scalzo was a 
gentle person with no criminal record and no history of wife abuse before the 
shooting. Price attributed the shooting to an organic brain disorder caused by 
Scalzo's use of Halcion and several other central nervous system depressants 
and muscle relaxants. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs were prescribed for Scalzo, an 11-year sheriff's veteran, after he 
suffered a back injury during an inmate disturbance at a county jail facility 
where he worked, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzo's injuries forced him to retire from the force in 1984, Price said, and 
he continued to suffer from pain and depression. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert S. Nishinaka successfully argued that Scalzo 
should receive 13 years in prison -- the maximum sentence -- for voluntary 
manslaughter. Nishinaka argued there is no proof that Scalzo was taking Halcion 
or other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzo was originally charged with murder but was allowed to plead guilty last 
May to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they permitted the plea bargain in part because of Scalzo's 
claim that he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the killing. It 
would be difficult to prove malice required for a murder conviction, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Barshop, who helped prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
During the four-day sentencing hearing, Scalzo himself took the witness stand 
to tell San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major he was sorry. "If I 
could change places with my wife, I would do it without hesitation," Scalzo 
said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
But Scalzo's 16-year-old daughter, Claudia, told the judge drugs had nothing to 
do with the killing. "He's manipulative. He's mean. He's cruel," said Claudia 
Scalzo, adding that Scalzo possessed those traits before taking the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, which is manufactured by Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., is the most 
widely used prescription sleeping pill in the world, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Price said the federal Food and Drug Administration has received reports from 
doctors and patients linking the drug Halcion to 39 homicides or attempted 
homicides and 261 intentional overdoses since 1984. 
</P>

LUMBERYARD'S PERMITS IN JEOPARDY; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN PACIFIC: LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS SAY THE CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT DOESN'T 
CONFORM TO ZONING AND POSES A DANGER TO PUPILS AT A NEARBY SCHOOL. 
</P>

City officials intend to revoke Southern Pacific's permits to build a 
controversial lumberyard in Chatsworth that critics claim would pose a traffic 
hazard to students at a nearby elementary school, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Hal Bernson announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city Building and Safety Department's plan to revoke the permits is the 
third obstacle to the project to emanate from City Hall in recent weeks. "If 
they were smart, they'd go find another site," Bernson, who represents the 
area, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Aug. 31, the building department warned Southern Pacific that 
it intended to revoke its permits in 30 days on the grounds that the project 
doesn't conform with the zoning for the site. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Southern Pacific received permits to build a lumber transfer 
station at its property at 21510 Devonshire St. The plan was to ship lumber by 
rail to the site and then transport the material by truck to its final 
destination. A Southern Pacific track runs into the property. 
</P>
<P>
But local residents fought the project, claiming up to 70, heavily laden trucks 
per day driving past Chatsworth Park Elementary School would pose a hazard to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bernson, chairman of the city's planning committee, joined the fray, 
Southern Pacific has found itself facing three major obstacles. In two prior 
actions instigated by Bernson, the City Council voted to enact an ordinance 
temporarily prohibiting industrial projects in an area that included the 
Southern Pacific property, and the city's Building and Safety Commission voted 
to require the railroad to undergo an environmental review before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
But the zoning consistency issue was the "basic number-one challenge" to the 
project, Bernson said. "It should be a done deal now." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific executive Joseph Ellebracht said in an interview, "we haven't 
changed our mind about the project, but we have to take into account the 
reality of the current situation." 
</P>
<P>
He said his company has not decided to appeal the planned revocation. But he 
said the proposed project is "a different kind of animal" that may not be 
precisely covered by existing city zoning laws.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREEWAY'S TRUCK LANES TO BE CLOSED FOR REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The truck lanes of the northbound Golden State Freeway will be closed this 
weekend while workers repair a collapsed drainage pipe five feet below the 
pavement, the state Department of Transportation announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The lanes will close about 10 p.m. Friday, and trucks will be routed onto the 
regular traffic lanes. The truck route, a quarter of a mile north of the 
Foothill Freeway interchange, should be reopened by 1 p.m. Monday, Caltrans 
officials said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
POINT LOMA'S REASON TO REJOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next to efforts to move Lindbergh Field, the nasty controversy over the fate of 
shuttered Dana Junior High School may be the longest- running public affairs 
saga on Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
But that may soon change. Dana's fate appears almost settled -- to just about 
everyone's satisfaction. That would be a coup for the school system and a 
significant improvement for a community that has lived with this eyesore since 
Dana closed in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan endorsed by San Diego city school trustees Tuesday, Dana will be 
rehabilitated at a cost of $6 million and converted to offices for school 
personnel scattered throughout the city. Dana's auditorium would be made 
available to the community and its fields improved for use by Point Loma High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The school system would float bonds to fund the project, paying them off by 
leasing at least three other former school sites, probably to public or private 
educational institutions in search of classroom space. Administrators now 
working in those schools would be moved to Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, this idea is vastly preferable to the district's original plan 
to lease the 13-acre Dana site to condominium developers for 99 years. This 
way, Dana will remain a public facility, its ball fields doubling as play 
areas. High-density housing will not be shoehorned in among single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Years of vandalism and the school district's own cannibalizing of the facility 
are prime causes of the $6-million rehabilitation price tag. Hindsight is easy, 
but if the district had moved more slowly with plans to demolish the school for 
developers, more of the building might have been preserved. There's a lesson 
here in the value of listening more closely to community members who, from the 
beginning, opposed transfer of a school building out of public hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Point Lomans who rallied to save the site can savor the fruits of their 
activism. By 1993, they may have a refurbished public building that the 
community can use -- not resent. These days, few development battles end that 
way.

DRIVERS USE OF SHORTCUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on cut-through traffic ("Drivers Seeking Shortcuts Raise Hackles 
in Suburbia," Aug. 20) was certainly timely. This problem threatens to destroy 
neighborhoods as we have known them by replacing quiet, relatively safe streets 
with de facto thoroughfares for commuting drivers who are insensitive to the 
unfair burden they place on fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In our large Santa Monica neighborhood we have spent over two years building 
support for a "neighborhood protection plan" consisting of physical measures 
such as stop signs, restricted turning during rush hours and attractive 
planters at the end of some residential streets. Plaqued by unacceptable levels 
of cut-through traffic currently, and faced with 70,000 additional car trips 
per day that will be generated in the near future by three adjacent projects, 
residents are willing to accept some inconvenience for themselves if they can 
enjoy the benefits of reduced traffic, and be assured that emergency vehicles 
can still reach our homes. 
</P>
<P>
But such plans pose some problems for city governments. They can no longer 
surreptitiously use residential neighborhoods to absorb commercial traffic. 
They must confront the problem of excess traffic directly with street 
improvements, signal synchronization and ride-share programs. 
</P>
<P>
Your article doesn't mention the most important tool in neighborhoods' 
anti-traffic arsenal -- insisting that new projects not be built until 
developers and governments protect neighborhoods from the additional traffic 
that the projects will generate. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Santa Monicans and residents of Mar Visa joined together to oppose 
approval of the "Airport Project," more than 1 million square feet of 
commercial space which spelled disaster for Centinela and all the streets 
around it. Our success in defeating the project was the result of hundreds of 
volunteer hours: analyzing environmental impact reports to debunk faulty 
traffic analyses; demonstrating that the financial projections were overly 
optimistic and misleading; distributing lawn signs to raise public 
consciousness; collecting signatures on petitions, etc.

PEOPLE: CAREER ANSWER FOUND IN WHODUNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All the clues suggest that Dick Hart, 43, knew his new career would be a 
mystery. Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be 54 and say I should have," said the Laguna Hills man who 
has become what may be Orange County's sole mystery book specialty store owner. 
</P>
<P>
The store has a Sherlock Holmes-type magnifying glass hanging above the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the decision was based partly on midlife crisis, and in part was the 
fulfillment of what he called his "great American Dream." 
</P>
<P>
"I succeeded in what I had been doing and while I hadn't conquered everything, 
it was good," the Colgate University graduate said. 
</P>
<P>
Opening his own store has always been in his thoughts, said the transplanted 
New Yorker, who spent most of his working life in the wholesale furniture 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I wanted to merchandise something and mystery books seemed like a good 
idea. And I knew it would be in California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been to California several times, contending "I spent the equivalent of 
one year visiting Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Although he claims to have read every Perry Mason book and parts of most of 
what he carries in his store, he's not in it for a literary adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a businessman who owns a bookstore that has to make money," he said. 
"While I enjoy reading mysteries, at the end of the day I can put it down and 
go home." 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he was a voracious reader while growing up and had a particular 
liking for mystery novels. 
</P>
<P>
But Hart's late father, also a furniture wholesaler, had told him: "Never go 
into a retail business. The hours are long, long and longer." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hart went ahead and opened the Green Door Mystery Book Store in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Its hours are 10:30 a.m. to 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m. on alternating days, and it's 
open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"He was right," said Hart, who nevertheless is having a good time with his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
While Hart acknowledges that his work schedule is fatiguing, he says it is 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that "more money is coming in than going out" of his one-man 
shop helps ease the long hours and time away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if the business continues its moneymaking pace, he plans to open other 
stores to take advantage of what he considers a broadening market of mystery 
readers, most of them 24 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the store, The Green Door, was based on a trip Hart took to 
Scotland, where he rented a room with a creaky green door during a night of 
thunder and lightning. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me the room was haunted and I didn't sleep that night," he 
remembers. "I always said if I opened a business it would be called Green Door 
something." 
</P>
<P>
But he had some second thoughts because of an X-rated adult movie with green 
door in its title. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want people to think I was an adult bookstore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart feels mystery books will always be popular. 
</P>
<P>
"They (mystery books) are sort of real life, once removed," he said. "I think a 
new wave is coming in for mystery books and I have a head start."

The 1951 St. Louis Browns used 3-foot-7 midget Eddie Gaedel as a pinch-hitter. 
The 1980 Chicago White Sox played 58-year-old Minnie Minoso in right field. 
</P>
<P>
John Steadman of the Baltimore Evening Sun wants the Orioles to activate Cal 
Ripken Sr., 54. 
</P>
<P>
With Ripken Sr. behind the plate, Cal Ripken Jr. at shortstop and Billy Ripken 
at second, the Orioles could go Seattle one better, now that the Mariners have 
Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. in their outfield. 
</P>
<P>
An injured arm kept Ripken Sr. from playing in the majors, but he caught for 
seven seasons in the Orioles' farm system before becoming a minor league 
manager and later an Oriole coach. 
</P>
<P>
Add Ripken Sr.: Cal Ripken Jr. told Steadman: "That really sounds neat. I never 
thought about it. It would be an all-time thrill for brother Billy and me if 
Dad got a chance to be in the same game -- even if it was only for an inning or 
so." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ripken Sr.: "I don't know if I'd do it or not. . . . I wouldn't want to 
make a farce of anything. When I answered (Oriole farm director) Doug Melvin 
the other day and told him I wanted four at-bats, I wasn't serious in any way. 
I don't know it's all that important just to get my name included in the record 
book." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Ripkens are the fourth pair of brothers to play shortstop and 
second base for the same major league team. Who were the other three? 
</P>

Madden might return: From Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post: "Has it 
occurred to Al (Davis) to make the Raiders a permanently floating franchise, 
and play his eight home games in eight different cities? Select cities starving

Birmingham and, of course, Irwindale. An "Al Across America" tour. Have Sky

She tried to enroll in a basic English class at the University of Buffalo, but 
it was filled. 
</P>
<P>
"I began watching a lot of children's television shows, especially 'Sesame 
Street,' " she told Buffalo reporter Randy Schultz. "Then I went to a local 
bookstore and asked for children's books. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I basically learned how to speak English from 'Sesame Street' and Laura 
Ingalls Wilder books. And I've never gone back to the university to take that 
English course."

Chance of two lifetimes: In the second inning of the Oakland-Boston game at 
Fenway Park Tuesday night, Rickey Henderson fouled a pitch from Roger Clemens. 
The ball caromed off a luxury box and came right to Ron Vachon, 38. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon got a wrist on it, but the ball dropped into the box seats below. Tough 
chance, but in keeping with tradition, the fans booed. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson fouled the next pitch off the same luxury box. It sailed down lazily 
. . . to Vachon, who bobbled it, lost it and was booed again.

Add foul balls: Said Vachon, who attended the game with colleagues from Boston

TUCSON POWER SUES EDISON FOR LOSSES IN DERAILED MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financially ailing Tucson Electric Power filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
Wednesday against Southern California Edison in connection with Edison's 1988 
proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a move that eventually 
derailed Tucson Electric's previously proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks damages, interest payments and attorneys' fees that could total 
"hundreds of millions of dollars," Tucson Electric spokesman Roger Yohem said. 
Although Tucson Electric is seeking mone tary damages, the suit that was filed 
in San Diego Superior Court does not attempt to block Edison's pending merger 
with SDG&amp;E, Yohem said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit is totally groundless and without merit," Edison spokesman Lew Phelps 
said. "Tucson Electric Power at the time that it agreed to terminate its merger 
agreement with SDG&amp;E indicated that it wasn't damaged as a consequence of 
the termination of the (Tucson-San Diego) merger." 
</P>
<P>
"TEP by its own admission is in dire financial health, and they're apparently 
grasping at straws" with the lawsuit, Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
However, utility-industry observers said the unexpected suit could further 
complicate the already complex and controversial $2.4-billion stock swap merger 
between SDG&amp;E and Edison that is being reviewed by federal and state 
regulators. If completed, the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger would create the nation's 
largest investor-owned utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the Tucson utility was weakened financially after 
SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, proposed merging Edison with 
SDG&amp;E. Edison's intervention dashed Tucson Electric's hope of spreading its 
excess power generation among the broadened customer base that a merger with 
SDG&amp;E would have created. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot thickens with this lawsuit," said Michael Shames, executive director 
of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group that is 
opposing Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. "If the (Tucson 
Electric-SDG&amp;E) merger had gone through, Tucson would be in a lot better 
position than it is now. . . . The damages could be substantial. The 'hundreds 
of millions' figure is probably not an exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its initial merger agreement with Tucson Electric, SDG&amp;E agreed 
to pay the Arizona utility $25 million if the merger were not completed. Tucson 
Electric still expects to collect that $25 million, which is not connected to 
the Wednesday lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric's claim that Edison's uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E weakened the 
Arizona utility financially "is accurate to a degree," according to Doug 
Brooks, director of the Arizona Corporate Commission's Residential Utility 
Consumers Office, which represents Arizonans in utility matters before the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, "a lot has gone on with Tucson Electric Power other than the failure 
of the merger agreement," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tucson-based utility "took some significant hits last October" when the 
Arizona Corporations Commission ordered the utility's shareholders to absorb a 
significant portion of costs associated with new coal-fired electrical 
generating units, Brooks said. With the new units now on line, Tucson Electric 
has a surplus of relatively high-priced electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of those expensive and under-utilized power plants, Tucson 
Electric reported a $87.4-million net loss and $233 million in revenue for the 
six-month period that ended June 30. The utility reported a $41.4-million net 
profit and $260 million in revenue for the corresponding period the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric's stock, which closed at $53 a share July 26, 1988, the day 
that Edison unveiled its uninvited stock swap merger with SDG&amp;E, has traded 
in recent weeks at about $10 a share, Yohem said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit "seeks . . . (damages) for what's been lost to the company and its 
shareholders," since Edison made its bid for SDG&amp;E, Yohem said. "If the 
merger had been completed as originally planned, there would have been initial 
benefits to shareholders, but the company's ratepayers would also have 
benefitted down the line" through economies of scale that would have produced 
lower-priced electricity, Yohem said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in San Diego Wednesday afternoon charges that Edison and SCE 
engaged in "malicious, outrageous and oppressive" conduct and "willful, wanton, 
reckless and conscious disregard of the rights and interests of TEP" when it 
interfered with Tucson Electric's now-abandoned merger bid with SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's intervention caused TEP to suffer a "loss of substantial economic 
benefits and other damages," Yohem said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's lawsuit was the latest chapter in an already lengthy story 
involving Tucson Electric, SDG&amp;E and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The saga began on June 13, 1988, when SDG&amp;E and Tucson Electric announced a 
planned merger valued at $1.9 billion that would have produced a utility 
company with excess electrical generating capacity and an extensive electrical 
transmission grid. The utility, which was to have been headquartered in San 
Diego, would have had $5.6 billion in assets, 3.8 million customers and 5,681 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
But that merger fell apart on Nov. 3, 1988, just months after Edison made its 
uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E. Tucson Electricd's board of directors abandoned 
the merger rather than join SDG&amp;E in what the Tucson company believed would 
be a lengthy, costly and unsuccessful attempt to fight off Edison's merger 
offer.

COMPUTER FILE: USING OFFICE MACHINES AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Enkelis is a Redwood City, Calif., attorney who owns three 
IBM-compatible PCs. One is in his office, another is on his secretary's desk 
and the third is at home. 
</P>
<P>
He does most of his work at the office, but sometimes needs to take work home. 
Instead of stuffing floppy disks into his briefcase, he enters a single command 
on his office computer, leaves it running and heads for the parking lot. When 
he gets home, he continues working at his office machine, using his home PC as 
a remote terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Both Enkelis' home and office machines are equipped with modems and are running 
copies of Co-Session, a remote access program from Triton Technologies of 
Iselin, N.J. With Co-Session, Enkelis's home machine has access to all the 
resources of his office system, including his files, software, local area 
network and laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
Enkelis, like many attorneys, uses WordPerfect to write his briefs and legal 
pleadings. He has copies of WordPerfect on his office and home machine, but 
some of his files reside only on the office system. Co-Session allows him to 
access or transfer those files by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Once he has transferred the files he needs, he disconnects the modem and 
finishes the work using WordPerfect on his home PC. When finished, he logs back 
on to the office machine and, using his office's local area network, prints the 
document on the laser printer on his secretary's desk. It's ready when she 
arrives in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Enkelis also uses Co-Session to provide computer support to the Human Awareness 
Institute, a nonprofit group in San Mateo, about 15 miles from his office. 
Sometimes the institute staff needs help generating reports with PC-File, its 
database program. When that happens, they issue a command that puts their 
machine into host mode. That way, Enkelis can take over the machine from his 
home or office to format and print the report. 
</P>
<P>
Co-Session is one of several remote access programs. Others include Carbon Copy 
from Microcom Software of Norwood, Mass., and pcAnywhere from Dynamic 
Microprocessor Associates (DMA) of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Timbuktu from Farallon Computing of Emeryville, Calif., and Carbon Copy Mac 
from Microcom provide similar benefits to Macintosh users. Like their IBM PC 
counterparts, these programs give you access to all the commands and resources 
of a remote Macintosh, even if you're thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Timbuktu and Carbon Copy Mac can also be used to transfer files between Macs 
that are connected via modem. If the Mac on the other end is connected to a 
network, the remote user gets access to all of the network's services, 
including printers, hard disks and gateways to other computer systems. For all 
practical purposes, it's the same as being in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Another DMA program, pcMacterm, allows Mac users to control remote IBM 
PC-compatibles via a network or phone line. The IBM-compatible programs run in 
a window on the Mac, while Mac programs run in other windows. It's possible to 
copy and paste data between the PC and Mac and use the Mac to access resources 
on the PC's network, such as laser printers or hard disks. 
</P>
<P>
Remote control programs are ideal for training. A trainer, for example, could 
temporarily take over the screens of remote users to demonstrate a particular 
task. The trainer could use the same software to look over the users' 
shoulders, electronically speaking, as they perform a task. The local area 
network version of Timbuktu allows a teacher to view the screens of several 
remote machines at a time, each in its own window. 
</P>
<P>
Such software can be valuable for people who provide technical support services 
to other users. I have a San Francisco-based colleague who uses one of these 
remote access products to maintain a local area network for a bank in the 
Philippines. He is able to trouble-shoot problems and make software 
modifications without having to board an airplane. He has even used the dial-up 
system to install software on one of the hard disks on the bank's network. 
</P>
<P>
Software companies could use such programs to help their customers 
trouble-shoot problems. A technician, for example, could take over the screen 
of a customer's computer to try to locate a problem or demonstrate proper use 
of the software. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the programs come with separate host and remote packages. In 
others, you need to buy a separate copy for each machine. 
</P>
<P>
The only downside to these programs is that they can be slow. A typical 1,200- 
or 2,400-bit-per-second modem will allow you to connect the two machines, but 
running software via a modem can be noticeably sluggish, especially if the 
software uses graphics -- as is always the case with Mac software. A speed of 
2,400 bits per second may be adequate if you're using the remote program just 
to transfer files or issue a few commands to the host system. But if you plan 
to run software from afar, you're much better off with 9,600 bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
I'm now using a Courier HST 9,600 modem from U.S. Robotics and have been 
impressed with its speed and performance. If you get a 9,600-bits-per-second 
modem, be sure it offers MNP-5 or V.32 error correction and data compression. 
These protocols allow the modems to compress data at both ends, increasing the 
effective speed -- an important plus if you're trying to control a remote 
computer. Both the host and remote computer must be equipped with such modems 
to take advantage of their speed. 
</P>
<P>
Farallon offers a $1,295 Timbuktu Remote Access Pack, which has a 
9,600-bits-per-second modem, along with a copy of Timbuktu and a Remote-WakeUp 
Cable. The cable allows a remote user to turn on a Macintosh II via a phone 
line.

WELLS FARGO MAY RESCIND FREE ATM USE; 
</P>
<P>
BANKS: SERVICE FEE OF $1 COULD BE LEVIED FOR WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM ANOTHER 
BANK OR SAVINGS-AND-LOAN MACHINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the last two years, Wells Fargo has not charged customers its standard $1 
service fee when they withdraw money from other banks' automated teller 
machines in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells Fargo may be changing that policy soon, reflecting financial 
institutions' need for new ways to produce non-interest-generated revenue, 
industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrne, Wells Fargo's vice president for marketing in Southern California, 
says his bank's service-free policy for ATM use in San Diego may be terminated 
later this year, after the San Francisco-based institution makes final its 
acquisition of Great American Bank's California branches, including 64 in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"That has been discussed. . . . No specific decision has been reached," but 
free use of competitors' ATMs is not going to continue forever, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
The profit squeeze being felt by many banks has changed their attitude toward 
some of the free services offered up to now, said Gerry Findley, a Brea-based 
banking consultant and editor of the Findley Report. "Their bottom lines are 
under pressure (so) they're all looking at the charges for services they 
provide in all areas." 
</P>
<P>
Most banks in California already charge service fees of 75 cents to $1 when 
their bank card customers use a competitor's ATM. They make the charges mainly 
because the service is not free to the bank. "It's actually a very expensive 
process going through other banks," said Chris Chenoweth, general counsel for 
the California Bankers Assn. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, for example, belongs to the San Diego-based STAR System network of 
ATMs, which charges the bank a fee when its customers use another bank's ATM 
for a transaction. A certain part of the fee then goes to the bank whose ATM 
was used. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a cost to Wells Fargo (and waiving service fees) could wind up being 
very expensive to the bank," Chenoweth said. 
</P>
<P>
But acquiring the Great American branches will eliminate Wells Fargo's primary 
motive for the San Diego ATM policy, which was to compensate for the lack of 
"locational convenience" the bank offered its San Diego customers. 
</P>
<P>
Before the acquisition, Wells Fargo had so few branches that "we elected to 
provide this (service), at least on a temporary basis. . . . We just didn't 
offer the same convenience" in terms of branches or ATMs as other banks in the 
county, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Great American branch acquisition is complete, "you probably won't be 
able to drive six blocks without finding a Wells Fargo Bank in San Diego," he 
added. There will be at least two or three Wells Fargo ATMs at every bank 
location in the county, including the branches acquired from Great American. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a temporary kind of thing, (and) we did it for a very specific reason," 
Byrne said. "It probably would make some sense to make some modifications to it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo operated 18 branches in San Diego County two years ago, when it 
introduced the service-free transaction program. Now the bank has 24 branches 
in the county with an estimated $1.6 billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of customers from the 64 Great American branches, whose local 
deposits amount to an estimated $5.5 billion, will give Wells Fargo a combined 
deposit base of $7.1 billion, more than any other financial institution in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo officials would not disclose how many individual accounts or 
depositors the bank has at its San Diego County branches, nor how many it is 
gaining through the Great American deal. Historically, the 
savings-and-loan-dominated San Diego market has been a tough one for banks like 
Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
One bank that does impose service fees for transactions done on non-proprietary 
machines is Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a hard dollar cost to the institution," said Michael Occhino, a first 
vice president who manages Security Pacific's Electronic Delivery Division. 
"Customers don't have a problem with reasonable prices for services." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some banks have been willing to provide service-free transactions 
as a way to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
Banks "love to be able to use (free ATM use) for marketing," Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne emphasized that Wells Fargo's policy in the county was aimed strictly at 
satisfying existing customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We never advertised it," Byrne said. "We didn't use it as an offensive tool. 
And the reason we didn't was that we didn't intend for it to last forever and 
ever and ever." 
</P>
<P>
Some banks have been willing to absorb the expenses because it would cost too 
much for them to purchase and maintain enough ATMs to satisfy their customers, 
said STAR Systems president Ronald Congemi. "It's a strategic pricing 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
But Congemi said he thinks many of the West Coast banks that have not charged 
service fees will soon be following the practice of most U.S. banks, which is 
to charge fees for such transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend was actually quite late in hitting the West Coast," he said, 
attributing the delay to the sluggish development of local and regional ATM 
networks in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Even if banks that have not charged transaction fees do reconsider their 
policies, as Wells Fargo has in San Diego, some customers may continue to have 
access to conditional service-free ATM use. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Great American does not charge its customers to use other banks' 
ATMs if the customers maintain a balance of more than $20,000 in their combined 
personal accounts. Great American has also waived fees for customers who live 
in areas where their local branches do not have Great American ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
However, these policies may change after Great American's California branches 
are acquired by Wells Fargo, Great American spokesman Brian Luscomb said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a Great American policy. . . . The branches will be Wells Fargo 
branches and subject to their practices and procedures" after the acquisition, 
Luscomb said.

JENNY CRAIG DENIES CLOSING BRITISH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jenny Craig Inc., the Del Mar-based operator and franchiser of weight-loss 
centers, Wednesday disputed a British newspaper report that 33 of its centers 
in the United Kingdom had closed down because of financial problems of the 
British franchisee running them. 
</P>
<P>
In its Tuesday Editions, the Today newspaper reported that 33 Jenny Craig 
clinics, all situated in the greater London area, "went bust" this week because 
of "massive debts." 
</P>
<P>
Weight-loss clients -- the newspaper described them as "shocked slimmers" -- 
were informed of the closings in telephone calls Sept. 3. Many had already paid 
the $335 annual fee that the centers charge, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Craig Inc. spokesman Phillip Myers denied Wednesday that the centers had 
closed, but said closures are "being contemplated." He acknowledged that the 
company's British franchisee, Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres (U.K.) Ltd., and 
its managing director, Jeremy Beloff, were having financial problems. The U.K. 
centers have been open about three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's undecided whether (the centers) are going to stay open or close. The 
franchisee is reviewing his operations," Myers said. "There have been some 
market challenges in the U.K. . . . This is an unusual situation for Jenny." 
</P>
<P>
Myers declined to discuss what the company's options are if the United Kingdom 
operation was too fail. 
</P>
<P>
The Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres chain has grown rapidly since its founding 
in 1982 by wife and husband, Jenny and Sid Craig. System-wide revenues will 
reach $500 million in 1990, or double last year's sales, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
The centers, which offer weekly weight-watching classes and sell low-calorie 
packaged diet foods, now total 570 in the U.S., Australia and the United 
Kingdom. The number of U.S outlets has grown to 433 from just 14 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which owns 70% of its centers, has been rapidly gaining on 
industry leaders Nutri/System and Diet Centers, each of which have more than 
1,000 storefronts. Company officials have said they expect 1,000 Jenny Craig 
Weight Loss Centres to be open in the United States alone by the end of 1993.

MAGAZINES: TWO GRIM, INSIGHTFUL LOOKS AT LIFE BEHIND BARS

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Dunne and Wilbert Rideau are scheduled to spend the rest of their lives in 
prison but under radically different conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne is an inmate at the U. S. Penitentiary at Marion, Ill., "America's 
toughest prison," according to the September WigWag. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau, a celebrated prison journalist, is housed in the Louisiana State 
Penitentiary and profiled in the October Details. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the articles, and the prisoners' lives, provide interesting insight 
into the existence of the 700,000 men and women incarcerated in the nation's 
prisons, and into the penal system itself. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau has been imprisoned for almost 30 years for the cold-blooded murder of a 
Louisiana woman. In that time he has become editor and publisher of The 
Angolite, a prison publication nominated for two National Magazine Awards last 
spring. His reputation as a muckraker has afforded him the chance to leave the 
prison on lecture tours and appear four times on ABC's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Rideau would seem the model of rehabilitation. Even behind bars, his good 
behavior and political clout provide him with considerable leeway. He dresses 
as he likes and calls the warden at home. There is considerable pressure in 
Louisiana for the governor to grant Rideau clemency. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Details piece hints that Rideau has not changed completely after all. 
As a 19-year-old murderer, Rideau had the power of life and death, Peter 
Wilkinson writes. As a prison journalist, he discovered "the power to bring 
change as well as the power to intimidate and manipulate through what one said 
-- with the right documentation -- in the press." 
</P>
<P>
The most privileged prisoners at the U.S. Penitentiary at Marion probably 
cannot imagine the sort of freedom Rideau is allowed. Marion is the "last stop" 
in the nation's system of 711 prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Housed at Marion are criminals so vicious that even the guards at San Quentin 
and Attica don't want to deal with them. Also housed here, Susan Lehman 
reports, are those whose crimes dictate that they receive special protection, 
such as convicted spies John Walker and Jonathan Pollard. But Lehman also 
suggests that some prisoners at Marion are there for political reasons -- are, 
in fact, political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of 50 or so prisoners who are allowed to dine together and 
work in the prison factory, most Marion inmates are locked in their cells at 
least 22 1/2 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Alone in their cells, inmates can take a step in one direction and two steps 
in the other," Lehman writes. "Meals arrive through a slot in the door. 
Prisoners dine on the floor; they have no chairs or tables. Most . . . live in 
cells without windows." 
</P>
<P>
These conditions do not make the prisoners happy. Inmate Dunne wrote to WigWag: 
"There are indications that the hall screaming and cell talking (talking and 
singing in the isolation of a cell, particularly when it is dark and quiet and 
psycho demons have free reign to roam the mindscape) are evidence of 
psychological trauma." 
</P>
<P>
As Lehman points out, Marion seems to reflect the future of prisons in America. 
This disturbs her. She and others want reforms at Marion. Her conclusion is 
that society, as well as these inmates, would be better served by a program of 
productive activity. 
</P>
<P>
She makes her case well, although she does not iron out the finer points, such 
as what to do with the folks such as Matthew Granger, who came to Marion 
because he killed a guard in another prison, smashing his skull, shoving his 
keys down his throat, then cutting off his head with a piece of glass. 
</P>

* Just starting to sleep soundly again now that the threat of global 
thermonuclear war no longer seems quite so acute? Well, wake up! There's a 
whole universe of potential apocalypses in the form of asteroids. If one of 
those puppies beans the Earth it could be curtains for Homo sapiens. The 
September California magazine presents an entertaining, informative look at the 
people who track asteroids and at plans to fend off an asteroid in the 
relatively unlikely event that one gets us in its sights sometime soon. 
</P>
<P>
* Girl Scouts can now attend a "High Tech Computer Whiz Camp." Kids go hunting 
or fishing or mountain climbing in a video game, unconcerned about mosquitoes 
or sunburn or the other annoyances of the great outdoors. Have these visual 
temptations divorced children from nature? In an evocative, sometimes nostalgic 
and finally optimistic essay in the September-October Sierra, Richard Louv 
examines how children of this generation and others feel about the wilds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINE VS. MAGAZINE 
</P>
<P>
* Anyone who thinks of Cosmopolitan as a sort of Penthouse for women had best 
turn to Kathryn McMahon's article, "The Cosmopolitan Ideology and the 
Management of Desire," in the August issue of UCLA's Journal of Sex Research. 
"The immense popularity of Cosmopolitan," McMahon found, "may be attributed to 
the powerful contradictions the magazine represents and contains through 
strategies of self-management. . . . The text offers the fantasy of revenge for 
class and gender subordination through images of women's sexuality used to 
dominate and control men on their own turf."

* From the moment it arrived in the United States, AIDS was a disease destined 
to inflame the worst impulses of conspiracy theorists. Now one of the theories 
concocted about AIDS appears on the cover of a national magazine. The question 
mark in the headline -- "AIDS: Is It Genocide?" -- does nothing to mitigate the 
story's sensational, irresponsible tone. 
</P>
<P>
The article, in the September Essence, takes a through-the-looking-glass 
approach to reportage. Credentialed, reasonable scientists are allowed to 
dispute the notion that AIDS was somehow introduced by someone to do something. 
</P>
<P>
But the piece makes no distinctions about the credibility of its sources. It 
allows conspiracy theorists to espouse half-baked ideas, backed up with only 
such flimsy, alleged evidence as a 1969 issue of the Congressional Record and 
newspaper stories. 
</P>
<P>
And while the scientific community, the piece asserts, remains "unclear" about 
where the disease came from, some "experts" -- physicians trained in 
pharmacology, gastroenterology and dermatology, a black studies professor -- 
"claim to have a concrete theory about exactly where the virus began . . . ." 
As one of the alleged experts claims: "There is a possibility that the virus 
was produced to limit the number of African people and people of color in the 
world . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that Elvis is circling the Earth in a spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS remains a tough enemy. To defeat it, it will require clear thinking and a 
unified effort. Mushy tabloidism only hurts the cause.

Well, it could have been worse. Our 9-foot-tall bronze pal John Wayne -- the 
chunky gunslinger in spurs and rolled-up pants at John Wayne Airport -- could 
have been spiffed up with a bright red bandanna or ruby lips, or pink cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the "colorized" version of the sculpture that greets visitors inside the 
glass entryway of the new Thomas F. Riley Terminal just got a more . . . well, 
a more leathery look. His jacket is now a caramel color, his shirt is a darker 
brown, his Stetson is gray and his yellow-brown pants now look as though 
they've bit the Western dust from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
Why did artist Robert Summers garnish his 1982 handiwork with a new patina? 
Because he felt that once the piece was moved indoors and subjected to 
artificial lighting, its old oxidized glow wasn't quite the thing. 
</P>
<P>
But the real question is: Why did the powers that be have to give our bronze 
friend such a prominent place in the new terminal? Yeah, I know, I know, the 
airport was named after the actor -- who lived in Newport Beach -- because he 
was the embodiment of "a true American patriot" and "traditional American 
values," according to the 1979 resolution of the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the many recent reports of artistic censorship in these parts -- 
including charges by artist Jim Morphesis that his "Winged Figure" painting was 
not used for the official airport poster because it included male nudity -- 
suggest that the county's attitudes remain ultraconservative. So what else 
could we expect but a plodding, representational sculpture of a "patriot" in a 
new structure that is the county's proud commercial equivalent of the 
Performing Arts Center? 
</P>
<P>
It was probably too much to hope that county superpatriots could be appeased by 
looking at Wayne's bronze embodiment in the parking lot somewhere, and allow 
the airport to acquire a work of artistic distinction for the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, what with the budget problems that have plagued the building 
project -- resulting in such disappointments as the lack of interior finish on 
the metal panels in the barrel-vaulted ceiling -- it's all too easy to imagine 
the sort of dismal, cut-rate piece that might have taken the Duke's place. 
</P>
<P>
There is art elsewhere in the airport, in the inaugural exhibition, "Urban 
Landscapes and Transportation Images," organized by Community Arts Inc. of San 
Francisco. The Airport Arts Commission selected this nonprofit organization 
primarily because of its experience in organizing exhibitions at San Francisco 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to site a monumental permanent sculpture to play off the 
architectural details of a public space, and quite another to pull together a 
temporary airport art show. While the Thomas F. Riley Terminal really missed 
the boat in not commissioning a commanding and significant work of art for its 
entryway, it can't be expected to mount the same kind of temporary art exhibit 
under its roof that you would expect to see at a distinguished museum. 
</P>
<P>
When 10,000 people a day and their luggage are jostling past the works on view, 
safety and security issues become paramount. People tend to be either 
frantically rushing about or aimlessly killing time. Many are nervous about 
flying, or preoccupied about the places they've just left or the places they 
will be in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, works of art are obliged to serve the "airport experience" in a way 
not dissimilar to a paperback book, a cigarette or a martini -- to divert, give 
pleasure and anesthetize against the numbing rigors of getting from one place 
to another with too much luggage, too little time and the constant 
companionship of a horde of other people you normally would never wish to meet. 
</P>
<P>
The current exhibit -- on view through Nov. 28 -- consists of paintings, prints 
and works of sculpture, displayed along the north and south concourses on the 
departure level (Level 2) of the terminal, as well as in the second story of 
the lobby. (To get to these areas, you have to pass through the airport 
security system.) 
</P>
<P>
According to the Airport Arts Program, 16 of the 41 California artists are from 
Orange County -- meaning that they have lived here, were educated here or 
worked here at some point in their careers. The labels don't indicate which 
artists are, or were, "locals," but that's probably a touch of provincialism we 
can live without. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work -- which incorporates plane, car, boat and other vehicle 
imagery -- is brightly colored, lighthearted and full of detail or loose, busy 
brushwork. Cartoon-like figures abound, and the exhibit as a whole has a daffy, 
"Look Ma, I'm so cute" air. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the sort of attitude that generally gets high marks in the art 
world. Even the concept of lumping together works of art based purely on shared 
imagery and a cheerily upbeat outlook would seem trite in a museum context. 
</P>
<P>
But an airport is not a museum. Some of the work, at least, seems sufficiently 
complex or striking to attract an idle traveler's attention, even if the show 
as a whole is lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
During a briskly escorted pre-opening tour on Tuesday, I was able to see only 
the pieces in the north concourse and the small sculptures, displayed in museum 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sculptures, Scott Schoenherr's "Immigration" -- a large ceramic boat 
peopled with identical figures of hatted men clutching briefcases -- seems to 
be offering a wry commentary on the colonization of distant places with 
executives of multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin Shuler's "Spindle Plane" -- a polka-dotted model mounted on a spindle 
and accompanied by miniature toy workmen, each of a different (racial?) color 
-- is a reworking of the Orange County artist's familiar images of impaled 
cars. David Gale's "Tropic of Cargo" is an elegant metal crossbow construction, 
with an airplane in place of the arrow. The accompanying small metal sculpture 
head in a generic "African" style smacks of the chi-chi simple-mindedness of 
decorator art, however. 
</P>
<P>
In the north concourse, Roy de Forest's dotty (literally and figuratively) and 
gently subversive style shows itself to good effect in a large painting, 
"Sailing With the Couple Tough and Mr. Rauty." The oddball passengers in the 
boats include a silhouetted red nude with an exotic headdress, a fellow in a 
green Afro, a huge, sad white dog, a big bird and a white man covered with the 
artist's trademark little dots. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Houston's "Stella Truck" is something of an insider art joke -- the 
three-dimensional piece consists of a geometric painting, in the "protractor" 
style of artist Frank Stella, mounted on wheels and attached to a truck cab. 
Mildred Kouzel offers her familiar Greek vase images updated with freeway 
scenes (in one piece, the handles of the vase neatly serve as overpasses). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bullwinkle's "White Star Airlines" is a giant painted steel construction, 
a flattened plane with toothy, red-lipped passengers visible through oversize 
windows. Oddly, considering the context, the pilot in this piece looks like 
he's having a fright attack. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also includes a number of small wall cards with quotes about travel 
by such famous literary figures of the past as novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, 
playwright George Bernard Shaw, poet Robert Frost and critic William Hazlitt. 
(A sample, from naturalist Henry David Thoreau: "The man who goes alone can 
start today, but he who travels with others must must wait until that other is 
ready.") 
</P>
<P>
Good stuff, this -- food for thought in a frantic world. May we hope for a 
bigger pool of quotes from women, people of color and famous folks of our own 
generation in the future? 
</P>
<P>
After all, what better place to show an awareness of the immense diversity of 
this planet than at an airport?

SIX NEW WORKS TO HIGHLIGHT GLOBE SEASON;

<P>
The West Coast premiere of a new play bR Gurney and a California premiere by 
two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson will highlight San Diego's Old 
Globe Theatre's 1991 winter season of six new works, theater officials 
announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
All of the plays are by contemporary authors. 
</P>
<P>
The season marks a departure for the Old Globe, which is known for balancing a 
handful of new plays with more familiar, classical works. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of season we would not have deemed possible eight years ago. 
It would have seemed foolhardy," Old Globe Artistic Director Jack O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The familiarity of the authors to San Diego audiences made a season of all new 
plays possible this year, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
"People trust these writers. They want to see the new work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of Wilson's "Two Trains Running" will mark the playwright's 
third West Coast premiere in four years at the Old Globe, and Gurney's "The 
Snow Ball" will be his third world premiere here in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Two additional world premieres on the schedule, Lillian Garrett's "The White 
Rose" and Larry Ketron's "Sun Bearing Down," have already been presented in 
staged readings here earlier this year as part of the Old Globe's Play 
Discovery Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe is co-producing Wilson's "Two Trains Running" with the Yale Repertory 
Theatre where the play debuted earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson's two earlier Pulitzer Prize-winning plays, "Fences" and "The Piano 
Lesson," "Two Trains Running" looks at another decade of African-American life 
in the 20th Century; it takes place in a Pittsburgh diner in 1968 after the 
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Tony-award winning director Lloyd 
Richards, who directed all of Wilson's previous works in this series, will 
direct the play which runs from March 14 to April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe will co-produce A. R. Gurney's "The Snow Ball" with the Hartford 
Stage Company in Hartford, Conn., where O'Brien will stage the world premiere 
in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"The Snow Ball," running here May 9 though June 16, is a 15-character play 
adapted from Gurney's novel of the same name. It focuses on the author's 
familiar world of genteel but disenfranchised American WASPs. Graciela Daniele 
will choreograph the story of a couple who, 40 years after the fact, try to 
recreate the romance of their first meeting a dance called the Snow Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney's last world premiere at the Old Globe, "The Cocktail Hour," went on to 
a successful off-Broadway run under O'Brien's direction. 
</P>
<P>
The season at the Globe's two indoor theaters kicks off with two world 
premieres, "The White Rose" on the Old Globe main stage Jan. 17 to Feb. 24, and 
"Sun Bearing Down" at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage Jan. 12 to Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Rose," directed by Old Globe executive director Craig Noel, will run 
Jan. 17 through Feb. 24. It is based on the true story of a band of German 
students who were martyred fighting against Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
"Sun Bearing Down," a story about life in a seafood restaurant along the South 
Carolina coast, will be followed by the San Diego premiere of "Other People's 
Money," Jerry Sterner's Off-Broadway comedy hit about a sleazy corporate raider 
who tries to take over a New England town, running March 9 to April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Cassius Carter season concludes with "La Fiaca," May 9 though June 16, the 
latest offering by the Old Globe's Teatro Meta project. The director of the 
theater's Teatro Meta arm, Raul Moncada, provides the new translation of 
Ricardo Talesnik's black comedy about what happens when a man wakes up one 
morning to find that he simply can't face another day at the office -- and just 
stays home. 
</P>
<P>
Directors for the plays at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage have yet to be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien called the season "the year of the writer" and referred to it as "a 
season about brand new work with a lot of old friends." 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe previously produced Wilson's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and 
"The Piano Lesson," both of which went on to Broadway, where "The Piano Lesson 
is still playing. The theater previously produced Gurney's "Another Antigone" 
as well as "The Cocktail Hour." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, author of "The White Rose," has appeared at the Old Globe both as an 
actress, in "Love's Labor's Lost" and "The Fanlights," and worked as a 
director, in a successful run of "The Granny" this January. 
</P>
<P>
And the Old Globe produced "La Fiaca" in a small-scale workshop production at 
the Marquis Public Theatre in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien cautioned against seeing the season of all-new work as a trend. 
</P>
<P>
"I just go down to the market and see what's fresh. Then I say come on over," 
he said.

You may think of a used-book store as bookshelves jam-packed and rising to the 
rafters of a small, rather dingy space. Stacks and boxes full of musty, dusty 
books and magazines covering every square inch of the store give the feel of 
rummaging through an attic for a true find. Then the feeling you get as you 
leave with your new acquisitions -- arms full of literary treasures for just a 
few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
To every rule there is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Works &amp; Music, with its airy openness and black-and-white tile floors, 
looks more like a spacious gallery than an antiquarian's shop. Well-tended 
shelves of dust-free books share space with works by local artists throughout 
the store. A grand piano holds court in the middle of the store in the arts and 
architecture section. 
</P>
<P>
If you stay long enough on a Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evening, you will 
see this bookstore turn into a performance space. Sometimes it becomes a 
concert hall for a jazz guitarist or a lecture hall for a poet or scholar. Even 
-- as it will this weekend -- an opera house for an evening of comic opera. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got it down to a pretty good system," Words &amp; Music owner Dorothy 
Gripke said of their rapid transformation. It's just a matter of rolling out 
some chairs that are stored in the back room and creating an intimate setting 
for performer and audience, she said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not your normal bookstore. And Gripke is not your normal bookseller. 
Since she took ownership of Words &amp; Music a year ago, Gripke has worn many 
hats for many roles. With a background in finance, Gripke is the first to admit 
that she "knew nothing about bookstores." She did know, however, that she 
wanted to leave the corporate world, where she worked for an insurance and 
investment company. 
</P>
<P>
Gripke is the acquisitions librarian, gallery director and concert presenter -- 
but only for a few more weeks. She is moving out of state and has put the 
business up for sale. But, despite the impending changing of the guard, Gripke 
has scheduled music and art events well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
September is well booked with an eclectic mix of events, including poetry 
readings, several jazz concerts (including the Art Johnson Trio and Peter 
Sprague) and, the month's opener tomorrow night, an evening of P.D.Q. Bach 
performed by Discount Comic Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
The company is "a real fly-by-night operation," according to producer-director 
and resident "Off-Coloratura Soprano" Kellie Evans-O'Connor. Discount Comic 
Opera tends to poke a lot of fun at classical opera and the company itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to know that opera is a cheap thrill. Underline the word 
cheap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap is definitely the way they go. To streamline production and cut costs, 
this five-member group does everything itself, from making sets and costumes to 
acting as orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is all of us are accomplished musicians," said Evans-O'Connor. 
Indeed, most of the members come from day jobs with the San Diego Opera or 
Comic Opera. Musical Director and "Piano Very Forte" Christopher Allen spends 
his days working with the Opera Theater at San Diego State University, as well 
as acting as assistant director of the San Diego Men's Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is comic opera, the orchestra must have a twist. Shunning more 
traditional instruments, Discount Comic Opera opts for "kazoos, slide whistles 
-- interesting instruments like that," Evans-O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the antics, these performances appeal to serious music lovers as well 
as the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
"The music is well-written and well grounded," Evans-O'Connor said, but the 
humor takes off. Most of the jokes and puns of these satires are in the names 
of the pieces and musicians themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulwark of Discount Comic Opera's repertoire is the work of the fictitious 
P.D.Q. Bach, "the least known and oddest son" of musical genius J.S. Bach. (The 
P.D.Q. alludes to J.S. Bach's prolificacy as a father; he had about 20 
children.) The character was created by musician and humorist Peter Schickele, 
a composer of note with many motion picture scores to his name, including 
"2001: A Space Odyssey." P.D.Q. Bach flourished -- his "history" and his works 
-- in the late 1960s and '70s, and a cult following developed. 
</P>
<P>
Discount Comic Opera's hub piece (or "hubcap" piece, as Evans-O'Connor refers 
to it), "The Stoned Guest," a "half-act, tour de farce" that throws together 
"Carmen" and "Don Giovanni," will be performed Friday evening along with the 
oratorio "The Seasonings" and two madrigals, "The Queen to Me a Royal Pain Doth 
Give" and "My Bonnie Lass She Smelleth." 
</P>
<P>
"We do our best to explain everything," Evans-O'Connor said of the gag-oriented 
performances. This ensures that audience members who might be musically 
illiterate will get as much a kick out of the comedy as would an opera 
aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this art and music, one might forget that Words &amp; Music is 
actually a bookstore. But, with most books discounted at least 50% off their 
cover price, a bookstore spelunker can still walk out with his arms full of 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
With his ears full of music and his eyes full of aesthetic pleasures, his nose, 
fortunately, will not be full of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Words &amp; Music, 3806 4th Ave. in Hillcrest, is open from 11 a.m to 7 p.m. 
Monday through Saturday. Performances are Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. 
Tickets are generally $9 each. For schedule information, call 298-4011.

POLICE DEFEND TREATMENT OF MAN WHO DIED IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula police on Wednesday defended their treatment of a 23-year-old man 
who died in their jail of a suspected drug overdose and said they could not 
rule out the possibility that the man smuggled cocaine in with him. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Walter H. Adair said Daniel Guajardo, who was found dead about 10 
hours after he was arrested, may have entered the jail cell with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know if officers had done a body cavity search. 
</P>
<P>
However, Adair said it was his opinion that the man had simply had a delayed 
reaction to the cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicology reports that may explain whether Guajardo died of a cocaine overdose 
might not be finished for eight to 12 weeks, coroner's investigator Mitchael 
Breese said. An autopsy on Guajardo revealed no apparent cause of death such as 
disease or injury, he said. The body did have "marks from a fight he had with 
his wife," Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police said there were no indications when Guajardo was booked that 
he was at risk of suffering an overdose. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no indication of a medical emergency, so there was no need to take 
him to the hospital," Adair said. "We arrest hundreds of people every year who 
are under the influence who don't need to be taken to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo was arrested about 5 p.m. Monday at an apartment complex in downtown 
Santa Paula after a heated argument with his wife, his relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo was highly emotional and agitated when officers arrived, Adair said. 
Guajardo was exhibiting symptoms that signal someone is on cocaine, such as 
dilated pupils and a high pulse rate, said Commander Bob Gonzales of the Santa 
Paula Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
One officer used a restraint hold to put handcuffs on Guajardo but did not 
cause any injuries, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession, being under the 
influence of cocaine and interfering with a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
Three folded paper containers holding cocaine were discovered in the police car 
that was used to take Guajardo to the station, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo admitted that the drugs belonged to him, Gonzales said. The officer 
said squad cars are routinely checked when officers change shifts in case a 
suspect has stashed drugs under the seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after Guajardo was arrested, he was able to remember phone numbers, 
Adair said. He called his family and complained of chest and leg pains, his 
estranged wife said. 
</P>
<P>
A sergeant who has worked as a narcotics officer checked on Guajardo, Adair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo, who was last seen alive at 1:30 a.m., was pronounced dead when he was 
found between 3 and 3:15 a.m., Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said Sgt. Wes Easley found Guajardo's body. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very stressful for everyone concerned, the department and the family," 
Adair said. "It's very disconcerting to have something like this happen." 
</P>
<P>
The family said Guajardo, who is survived by his wife and four children, was 
not a violent man. 
</P>
<P>
He had been arrested in the past 10 years by the Santa Paula Police Department 
on suspicion of possessing switchblades, on suspicion of grand theft and twice 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Adair said. He said he had no 
further information on the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Adair said the department would have more comments about the case when the 
toxicology report is completed. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was possible to develop an arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat, after 
taking cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his heart did fine until afterward when he was coming down off of it and 
developed an arrhythmia," Breese said.

OJAI SCHOOLS LEADING LIST OF WATER WASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Meiners Oaks County Water District has begun fining customers who have not 
reduced their water consumption, and the Ojai Unified School District drew the 
largest penalty, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The school district was billed $173 for using 943% more water at Meiners Oaks 
Elementary School from July 19 to Aug. 19 than it did in the same period last 
year, said Ron Singleton, water district general manager. In addition, the 
school district was fined $191 on the July bill for overuse although other 
customers were not fined at that time. "They were so blatantly overusing, we 
couldn't let them get away with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The water company billed 349 of its 1,200 customers who have not voluntarily 
reduced water consumption by 20% as they were asked to earlier this year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't seem to be getting through to the people," Singleton said. "The 
usage increased last month so we decided to implement the charge to make people 
more aware they need to get with the program." 
</P>
<P>
The fines for August range from 19 cents to $173, Singleton said. They 
represent a 25% increase in the normal billing rate for any water consumption 
beyond 80% of the amount used during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Leo T. Molitor said the school used more water because the 
playground was reseeded and a new sprinkler system was installed to replace 
lines cracked during construction of a portable classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we used an awful lot of water, but we are doing everything possible to 
reduce our overall consumption by 20%," Molitor said. "We have reduced our 
water use in the district by 19% over last year. However, our highest use was 
at Meiners Oaks Elementary School." 
</P>
<P>
The water company has received about 20 customer inquiries about the additional 
charges, Singleton said, but most callers are also asking what they can do to 
reduce their consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The company is buying water this summer from the Casitas Municipal Water 
District to supplement the firm's well water from the dwindling Ventura River 
basin. Singleton said it is the first time that the company has used Lake 
Casitas water in more than a decade, except during a brief stint in 1985 when a 
forest fire swept into Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to be mean or vindictive," Singleton said. "We have to prove 
to Casitas that we're cutting back 20%, and we're starting to get into our 
heaviest cycle with big demand." 
</P>
<P>
Water consumption all summer drains the wells, Singleton said, and because 
lawns and orchards are dry, they need more water in September, he said. The 
Casitas water district has asked all water companies that rely on its water to 
reduce consumption by 20% but has stopped short of rationing or levying fines. 
The district supplies water to 14 other water companies in Ventura and the Ojai 
Valley.

OXNARD POLICE USE TATTOO COLLECTION TO TRACK CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAJA RADEVICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oscar Rivera was a marked man from the start. 
</P>
<P>
After the recent robbery of an Oxnard home, a witness remembered that the 
robber had a tattoo of a teardrop underneath one eye and tattooed writing on 
the left side of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police ran the information through their computer and eventually 
identified Rivera as a suspect. He later pleaded guilty to felony charges and 
is now in Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have that information about the tattoos this would have been just 
another unsolved case," said Detective Daniel Christian of the Oxnard Police 
Department. "The rest of the description was too generic to be of help." 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, the department has kept a computer file and photo 
collection of all the tattoos they see on people booked at the station and on 
suspicious characters they stop on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Port Hueneme Police Department is the only other police department in the 
county with a comparable program, but it is newer and much less extensive. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people have their tattoos on file in the Oxnard police 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the computer file, the station has eight large photo books 
stuffed with pictures of offenders and their colorful body designs. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police said they do not have records of how many cases have been solved 
through the use of their tattoo information. But they said it has been a 
significant aid in identifying criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most popular tattoos include peacocks, with 503 renditions on file; 
roses, which are represented 238 times; and teardrops, of which there are 117 
decorating faces around town. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, one teardrop tattoo was put on for each person the wearer killed," 
Christian said. "But since that time, it's lost its significance. I mean, if 
there was a murder for every teardrop tattoo we see, the hallways here would be 
filled with dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Jane LeMond of the Oxnard police crime analysis department estimated that more 
than 50% of area convicts have tattoos. And she said about 95% of those on file 
are men. 
</P>
<P>
Among the women, roses and names of boyfriends are the favorites. "Women are a 
bit more dainty with their tattoos than men," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
With the younger set, gang affiliations and nicknames are popular. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this 16-year-old who had his name tattooed across the right side of 
his chest," said Linda Gray, a department clerk who works with juvenile 
offenders. "One time when he was arrested he lied to the officer about his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the policeman spotted it on his chest and gave him an additional charge 
of giving false information to an officer."

STATE GRANT TO FUND ARTS ORGANIZATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County endowment foundation will receive more than $34,000 from a 
state agency to help finance local art projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Community Foundation, which receives money from private and 
public donors and redistributes them to other organizations, accepted the grant 
from the California Arts Council last month. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will hold fund-raisers throughout the fall and winter to match 
that amount with local money before distributing it to other arts organizations 
in the spring, said Sonya Tower, who works with the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance will use $12,500 for administrative costs, foundation President 
Kate McLean said. The remaining $21,888 will be distributed among arts 
organizations to help fund projects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's grants assisted about 14 organizations -- including the Ventura 
County Symphony, Tower said. The grants enabled the Plexus Dance Theatre to 
hold free performances and helped staff the Conejo Valley Art Museum, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Groups that apply for grants are judged on a project's artistic quality, she 
said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

VOGEL NAMED AS INTERIM SCHOOLS' HEAD

<P>
The chief financial officer of the Simi Valley Unified School District has been 
appointed interim superintendent to run the county's largest school district 
after Supt. John Duncan leaves later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Supt. Cathi Vogel will assume the top position Sept. 17, the day 
after Duncan leaves his $98,900-a-year position to become head of the San Ramon 
School District in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited and was honored to be chosen," Vogel said after the school board 
made the appointment Tuesday night. She will serve for about 50 days until a 
permanent superintendent is hired. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel, 46, has worked in administration for the 18,300-student school district 
since 1980. She holds a bachelor's degree in business management from Cal 
Lutheran University and a master's degree in public administration from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Under district policy, Vogel cannot compete for the top position since she will 
serve as interim superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant was hired in July to recruit a new superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Helen Beebe said the board will probably interview the top six 
to 10 candidates in closed sessions, then have a second private interview with 
the top two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Supt. Allan W. Jacobs, who has been with the district for 18 years, 
said Wednesday that he plans to apply. 
</P>
<P>
Applications are due Sept. 17. A superintendent is expected to be named by 
mid-October, Beebe said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials also voted to use state money to hire six teachers to reduce 
the size of 10th-grade English classes at the district's three high schools. 
The district expects to receive between $179,500 and $215,700, which will be 
applied toward an estimated $228,000 in teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The classes would shrink from 36 students to 20 under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Substitute teachers will cover the extra classes for two weeks until the 
district can hire temporary teachers. STEPHANIE STASSEL

<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department wrapped up its case Wednesday before 
the county Civil Service Commission in defense of its decision to fire an 
officer for alleged incompetence and inefficiency, using testimony from three 
of his training officers and his supervising sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Duron, 28, who appealed his firing to the commission, is scheduled to 
present his case today. 
</P>
<P>
Duron's attorney, Paul Goyette, said he will call on Duron's supervisors at the 
Ventura County Jail, where Duron served for two years before failing to 
complete a two-month patrol officer's training course in 21 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Sheriffs Department brought three of Duron's patrol training 
officers to the witness stand, all of whom testified that Duron had trouble 
reading maps, writing reports, picking up radio signals and locating the 
appropriate sections of the vehicle code while writing traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Goyette said Duron was never given a chance to succeed after he fell behind 
during the first weeks of his training program and that his client had proven 
himself while working at the jail. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

SCHOOLS DESIGN NEW PROFICIENCY TESTS

<P>
Seeking better ways to evaluate student achievement, the Fillmore Unified 
School District is designing its own testing program for reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Davis said at a school board meeting Tuesday that standardized tests 
such as the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills evaluate individual skills but 
do not give teachers a full picture of student progress. 
</P>
<P>
The board heard a presentation by members of a language arts committee that has 
spent two years on the project. They explained educational goals and an 
assessment process that will target grades two, five, seven and 10. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members said teachers would require some training to adapt to new 
methods of instruction and testing but were enthusiastic about the potential 
improvements in education. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the district will continue to use the California Assessment Program 
and District Proficiency tests when necessary to determine which students 
require remedial help. JANET BERGAMO

<P>
A high-speed chase along the Ventura Freeway through Ventura ended early 
Wednesday with the arrest of two men and a woman from the Sacramento area 
suspected of shooting at a passing motorist, a California Highway Patrol 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, a driver called 911 by cellular phone at 2:38 a.m. to 
report a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the driver nor the car was hit. The tip was relayed to a CHP officer 
who was pursuing a speeding Nissan matching the description of the car involved 
in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A radio check on the fleeing car's license plate number showed that it had been 
stolen, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended near Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff T. Wisdom, 23, of Carmichael; Charles R. Turner, 30, of Citrus Heights; 
and Janice M. Hershey, 24, of Citrus Heights were being held in lieu of 
$750,000 bail Wednesday night on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, 
brandishing a weapon at a vehicle, and other weapons and theft charges.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOUNDRY IN TORRANCE REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance foundry, which closed temporarily last week because of excessive 
emissions of airborne lead, has reopened after a judge's decision to relax an 
earlier court restriction on its release of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The Martin Brass Foundry, at 2341 Jefferson St., started up Tuesday after Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski ordered it to keep its lead 
emissions below 3 micrograms per liter of air. 
</P>
<P>
The federal standard for lead particles in ambient air is 1.5 micrograms per 
liter. But foundry attorney Charles Ivie successfully argued in a court hearing 
Tuesday that the threshold is meant to gauge airborne lead levels in large 
geographical areas, not at individual plants. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 16, Zebrowski ordered Martin Brass to keep its lead emissions within 
the 1.5-microgram range, after the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
detected airborne lead concentrations near the plant of up to 20 times the 
federal standard. 
</P>
<P>
The foundry has shut down twice in the last month to repair the vacuum system 
it uses to control lead dust. The most recent AQMD samples, taken Aug. 21, 
showed that the plant was emitting airborne lead in concentrations of 3 
micrograms per liter, officials with the air quality agency say.

Dr. James H. Garrity of Torrance has been appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley to the Los Angeles Task Force on Ethical Standards for Charities. The 
members of the task force are top executives and volunteers from a broad range 
of charities and nonprofit organizations. Garrity is executive director of the

DAVE DISTEL: HERE'S HOW THIS FALL'S REPORT CARDS WILL LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, class, it's time for the fall semester to start. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the football season. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of Ds and Fs in the fall around here lately, but this one 
may be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what to expect . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will be 2-3 in early October, but they will actually be in pretty 
good shape. Playing Cincinnati, Cleveland, Houston and Pittsburgh on successive 
weekends is a lot like vacationing in those cities on successive weekends. Not 
much fun. 
</P>
<P>
Opening in Dallas is like a vacation. This is, to be sure, not the first year 
the NFL has had byes. Anyone playing the Cowboys last year had one. 
</P>
<P>
Opening in Oregon will not be a vacation for San Diego State. The Ducks' tie 
for second in the Pac-10 was one of the best-kept secrets in college football 
last year. Eugene is a pleasant place to visit, but no place to play. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McGwire will pass for 400 yards against Cal State Long Beach, Wyoming, 
Utah, New Mexico and UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will be lucky to pass for 300 yards against anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista and Morse, which open the season against each other Friday 
night, will close the season on the same field when they play for the 3-A 
championship in December. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Curran will criticize a penalty against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Chargers will switch their center to left tackle, their left 
tackle to right guard, their right guard to left guard, their left guard to 
right tackle and their right tackle to center. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Aztecs will switch their center to left tackle, their left 
tackle to right guard, their right guard to left guard, their left guard to 
right tackle and their right tackle to center. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Booker will run 95 yards for a touchdown against UCLA, but it will be 
called back. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Billy Joe Tolliver nor Mark Vlasic will start more than two games in a 
row for the Chargers. A guy can only take so many mandatory eight-counts before 
he needs a break. 
</P>
<P>
After playing in the Orange Bowl last year and the Rose Bowl this year, the 
Aztecs need only play in the Sugar Bowl and Cotton Bowl for a Grand Slam of 
sorts. Of course, they have never been near any of those places on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will not lose on Sunday, Dec. 9. Bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't the Chargers used to make two or three Monday night appearances a year? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State will score 35 points . . . and lose. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will give up 14 points . . . and lose. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 halves will end with the Chargers in possession with timeouts 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard will win a 10K in the 50-54 age group, also finishing ahead of 
the 40-44 and 45-49 winners. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State will announce it has scheduled a home-and-home series with the 
Dallas Cowboys beginning in 1996. Dallas, meanwhile, will be hoping for an 
expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will disband their cheerleaders when it is discovered three of 
them posed for Popular Mechanics Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Curran will defend the play selection when the Chargers call a quarterback 
sneak on third and 12. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding high schools, the most successful San Diego football team will be 
USD. Playing for fun rather than for real can be real fun. 
</P>
<P>
Would someone please assure Jerry Coleman that Pio Sagapolutele and Steve 
Matuszewicz are defensive linemen at SDSU and not an up-and-coming second base 
combination? 
</P>
<P>
Rod Bernstine will play every offensive position but quarterback for the 
Chargers, unless, of course, they get to the point where they have to put out a 
call for volunteers to take that beating. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU and Brigham Young will be on CBS Sept. 22. The telecast will not be 
scrambled, but the secondaries might. With McGwire and Ty Detmer throwing the 
football, the combined score will be in the 80s . . . at least. 
</P>
<P>
If all three AFC wild cards don't come from the Central Division, the Chargers 
might actually have a chance. But this is a crazy year in which they could 
finish anywhere from second to last in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Key Charger Game: Dec. 30 at Raiders. Win, and they finish 10-6 and make 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's bowl hopes may be hopeless. It won't win the Western Athletic 
Conference, thus eliminating the Holiday Bowl. Should it have a "bowl quality" 
record, its chances would hinge entirely on community support as measured by 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Key Aztec Game: Oct. 6 at Wyoming. Win, and they finish 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the best game of the year hereabouts won't happen. The 
University of Miami will be here Dec. 1. It would be a great game . . . if the 
Hurricanes were playing the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, students, there will be no As around here this fall . . . but high 
Cs and Bs are a definite improvement.

USD MEN RELISH COMEBACK THAT TIES THIRD-RANKED UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 90 minutes of regulation and two 15-minute overtimes, the USD and UCLA 
soccer teams finished with a 3-3 tie Wednesday night at Torero Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But as far as USD (2-0-1) was concerned, this was a little like kissing Julia 
Roberts, and not just because UCLA (3-0-1) is ranked No. 3 nationally. The 
Toreros came back after UCLA also took an early, 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm happy with the tie," said Seamus McFadden, USD coach. "Actually it 
would have been a shame if either team lost, because both teams played so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
After an initial 10 minutes during which neither team could control the ball, 
UCLA changed tactics and began firing from long range. The result was what 
McFadden termed "two magical goals. UCLA won't score two goals prettier than 
that all year." 
</P>
<P>
Both were unassisted. In the 11th minute, freshman midfielder Jorge Salcido put 
one into the upper-right corner from 40 yards past freshman goalie Tom Tate 
from USDHS. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th minute, sophomore midfielder Chris Henderson took a shot from an 
improbable angle, along the left sideline some 30 yards from the end line. 
That, too, found the upper-right corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to be in for a long night at that point," McFadden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said those two quick goals actually led to his team's 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those two quick goals really hurt us," he said. "I think our players 
thought the game was going to be a little easier than it was." 
</P>
<P>
If they weren't thinking that, they at least seemed to be thinking about the 
bus trip home. Suddenly, UCLA's midfield disappeared, and USD was able to work 
the ball upfield and connect on passes in their attacking zone. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gelvezon put USD on the scoreboard in the 19th minute when he collected a 
centering pass from Leo Ronces, who was dribbling the ball along the right 
sideline. When Gelvezon got the pass from Ronces, he sidestepped one defender 
before letting go with a right-footer that got past freshman goalie Brad 
Friedel and into the left side. 
</P>
<P>
In the 31st minute, the Toreros tied it when Paul Adair took a shot from atop 
the penalty box. It wasn't a hard shot, and Friedel was moving slowly to his 
right to collect it when Phillip Button, a sophomore midfielder out of The 
Bishop's School, redirected it to the left of Friedel and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
With seven minutes left in the half, USD went ahead, 3-2, when Adair beat two 
defenders and centered to Gelvezon 10 yards in front of a wide-open goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA tied it 22 minutes into the second half on a counter-attack. Coby Jones, 
dribbling down the left side, sent a centering pass to Henderson, who banged it 
in.

A REPORT CARD ON SCHOOL LUNCHES; 
</P>
<P>
ON PAPER MOST SCHOOL LUNCHES LOOK THE SAME; ON THE PLATE THEY DON'T 
</P>

When canned purple plums recently appeared on the government's surplus 
commodities list, most school district food service managers weren't pleased. 
School-age children don't like canned purple plums. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton the plums were chilled, scooped straight from the can onto serving 
trays and set before the student body. 
</P>
<P>
The children promptly threw them away. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different in Stockton. There the plums were mixed with apples, 
cherries and spices, then sprinkled with a crunchy topping. Students loved it. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley Unified School District in Thousand Oaks developed a recipe for 
Plum Nutty Fruit Cake. It was a hit too. 
</P>
<P>
"If the kids knew (purple plums) were in the cake they wouldn't eat it," says 
Ruth Roberts, director of child nutrition services at Conejo. She says there 
are lots of commodities that children don't like -- sweet potatoes and frozen 
green peas, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Directors, Roberts says, have to "come up with some clever but nutritious ways 
of using them." Her staff puts peas through a food processor and adds them to 
Ranch Dressing -- it's called "green goddess." Mashed sweet potatoes go into 
tomato-based recipes, such as spaghetti or pizza sauce, to give the food added 
nutrition. Her staff even developed a recipe for a chocolate cake with pureed 
surplus green beans; the children loved it. "It's totally hidden," Roberts 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Every day more than 2 million school lunches are served in California. On paper 
most of them look the same. According to the federal Minimum Meal Pattern 
Requirements (formerly known as the Type A lunch), defined under the 1946 
National School Lunch Act, meals must contain two ounces of meat or a meat 
alternate, a cup of vegetables and fruit, eight servings per week of ead or a 
bread alternate and eight ounces of milk daily. Schools that meet these 
standards and participate in the National School Lunch Program receive federal 
assistance -- cash subsidies and donated commodities from USDA. 
</P>
<P>
But things have changed since 1946. Gone are the days when little old ladies in 
hair nets labored over hot stoves in school kitchens. The kitchens themselves 
have changed; they've turned into "food preparation areas." And, of course, 
lunch has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of today's standard menus are pizza, salad, fruit and an ice cream bar; a 
corn dog, fries or Tater Tots, apple wedges and trail mix; taco, fiesta rice, 
vegetable sticks and dip, a cookie; spaghetti, garlic bread, salad, gelatin; 
hamburger, potato rounds and a fruit cup; turkey and gravy, whipped or mashed 
potatoes, fresh fruit and roll. Cooking these lunches is an awesome task 
complicated by competition from fast-food restaurants, peer pressure, 
variations in ethnic eating habits and restrictive food services budgets. 
</P>
<P>
There are still a handful of schools in California with on-site kitchens, but 
most of this food is trucked in from a central kitchen where it has been 
squirted, dropped, pressed and sealed into pre-plated hot or cold packages. At 
the school, corn dogs, pizzas, burritos, chalupas (little taco boats) and other 
hot items are simply baked in convection ovens before serving. The cold 
component (fresh fruit, salad, gelatin), is kept refrigerated until serving 
time. Or, the trucks deliver food in ready-to-serve bulk trays prepared in a 
central kitchen. At the school a cafeteria worker, frequently assisted by upper 
grade students, simply scoops, slices and serves. 
</P>
<P>
The question is -- does anybody actually eat this food? It's an important 
question. Funds are allocated to food service departments according to the 
number of students who eat in the cafeterias; a drop in participation can make 
a big difference. "Food service departments," says Marilyn Wells, director of 
food services in the Alhambra Unified School District, "are forced to operate 
as a business, similar to McDonald's." To improve her business, Wells added 
grilled hamburgers and cola to her district's menu in 1984; participation 
increased from 27% to 34%. "Our goal," she says, "is to get in as many students 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
That is every food director's goal. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, The Times spoke with directors throughout the state about 
their school lunch programs. The differences were astonishing. Based on 
interviews with nutrition experts and food service directors, we chose some of 
the most representative districts in the state. Some food service directors 
show exceptional creativity in enticing students into the cafeteria, especially 
given the problems of working within the restrictions of the government feeding 
program. Others, faced with some particularly difficult circumstance, such as 
size of the district, manage to personalize their programs and make food that 
is appealing to children. Still, some school food services directors admit that 
what they are serving is "like airplane food," and others feel that 
standardization must be their major goal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONEJO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
"The better the director/manager," says Conejo's Roberts, "the higher the 
participation." Roberts has lured 70% of the students in her district into the 
cafeteria through an innovative program that includes monthly meetings with 
cafeteria managers and regular meetings with a student menu-planning board. 
</P>
<P>
"By giving the students a part in the decision making -- by having 
participative management -- that's how I ensure that what I want takes place at 
the schools." 
</P>
<P>
At her menu planning board sessions students learn about commodities, then 
develop ways to incorporate them into the school menu. "They seem to like fresh 
fruits and vegetables more than cooked or canned," says Roberts. She feels that 
the process allows her to strike a balance between what is good for the 
students and what they like. "Acceptability is a factor: You just can't shove 
food down their throats." 
</P>
<P>
Like the other districts in the state, Conejo must adhere to guidelines from 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Roberts doesn't think this is a problem; 
she says that there is a tremendous amount of flexibility in what can actually 
be served to children. 
</P>
<P>
For Mother's and Father's Day she invites parents to have lunch with their 
children and serves a special cookie with the meal. She assigns the name of a 
different principal each month to menu items, such as "Mr. Coyle's soft or 
regular taco." A list of children's birthdays appears in the "happy birthday" 
column on each month's menu. And, capitalizing on the craze for subterranean 
turtles, she named a new item on the menu, teriyaki-flavored chicken bites, 
"Ninja Nuggets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STOCKTON 
</P>
<P>
Lavada Esters of Stockton Unified School District also has an excellent 
program. Like Conejo's Roberts, she entices students into the cafeteria by 
involving them in menu planning. She holds a major food tasting, which includes 
the students. She also takes advantage of seasonal and special food prices, 
purchasing large quantities and storing them for future use. 
</P>
<P>
Although the schools in her district are on the pre-plate system, Esters has 
added flair and personality to her menus at Stockton. She takes advantage of 
government commodities. "Labor wise, it's more cost effective for us to make 
some of the products that we make: pizza and spaghetti sauce, multigrain pizza 
dough made with commodity whole wheat, bulgur, rolled wheat and all purpose 
flour." Cookies are also made with this multigrain flour mix as is a peanut 
butter-applesauce cake and a rolled wheat peanut butter brownie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little frustrating at first. People don't like a lot of changes. But we 
have expanded to include a lot of new things and we solicit input from the 
students. It's a challenge to find things that all of them will like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified is the largest school district west of the Mississippi; it 
serves more than 60,000 lunches each day. Because of its size, individuality is 
a near impossibility -- pre-plated lunches sold at Westside schools are the 
same as those in Eastside schools. Still it deserves a B for effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all controlled centrally because the managers don't have time to get 
involved in purchasing," says Anita King, chief nutritionist. Her eight 
nutrition specialists and six registered dietitians review all new products the 
district is considering for purchase; they are then evaluated in the district 
test kitchen, tested at the schools, and worked into the school menu. "We write 
all the specifications in the test kitchen, and reduce the fat and sodium in 
products we buy. That's important -- it makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
King and her staff have developed a set of nutrition practices to ensure that 
the district complies with the U.S. Dietary Goals. These include: increasing 
the amount of wheat bread products served to 70%; reducing certain additives in 
all food products; eliminating canned fruit in heavy syrup and using those in 
juice; decreasing the use of chocolate milk; maintaining nutrition levels -- 
particularly fat -- so they are consistent with U.S. Dietary Goals; promoting 
use of fresh fruits and vegetables; and developing desserts to include peanut 
butter, whole grains, and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with these goals, meat sauces are cooked from scratch in the 
manufacturing kitchen. So are batter breads, coffee cakes and cookies. The dry 
mixes are then sent to the central kitchen where workers add eggs, butter, etc. 
Cookies are then pressed into rounds and sent to the schools where they are 
baked. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard menu recipes, the district has established recipes 
for using unusual commodities. For example, prunes, a fruit few kids could 
love, are baked into fruit bagels. Butter isn't added to vegetables or breads. 
Meat sauces contain both ground turkey and ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
LAUSD does use some outside vendors. Sandwich breads, hamburger buns, hot dog 
rolls and dinner rolls are purchased from an outside bakery, then delivered 
fresh daily to schools. King says that the district once made pizzas from 
scratch in the central kitchen, "but it became expensive because it took quite 
a long time." She says that foods such as frozen pizzas can be processed more 
cost efficiently by a manufacturer who is already geared up for production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UKIAH 
</P>
<P>
Most school districts pre-plate their foods, but in Ukiah, the food is 
delivered in bulk. Although this would seem to have advantages, Les Ridgway, 
food services director of the Ukiah Unified School District, says the system 
isn't perfect. The food is cooked early in the day, then stored hot in a warm 
transport cart where it is held for serving. "Vegetables and especially 
hamburgers and hot dogs lose their heat rapidly. With the pre-plate system, the 
food might stand 20 to 30 minutes before serving time; in the bulk system it 
could sit as long as four hours." Another problem: Because the food is 
precooked and shipped out in large quantities, only one menu item can be 
offered to all schools. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Ridgway goes to great lengths to provide food that the 
students will eat -- and to compensate for nutritional losses during transport. 
The central kitchen makes its own sauces and chili beans from scratch (about 80 
gallons a week), roasts all turkeys and chickens, and tosses a fresh pasta 
salad using commodity pasta, garbanzo beans, parsley, a little onion and 
Italian dressing. The kitchen even adds a few olives. "It costs a little bit," 
Ridgway says, "but the kids love them and it looks pretty." Ukiah serves a 
fruit bar that is actually made of commodity prunes; surplus sweet potatoes go 
into a Cinderella cake. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway does buy a prepared pizza crust, potato rounds, cheese sauce for nachos 
and frozen burritos, but meat processed into steaks or "Rib-B-Ques" are not on 
the menu. "We prefer to use our own recipes . . . that way we know what is in 
it," he says. "And I don't think anyone can make chili better than ours. 
</P>

"I ask the kids what they like -- if they want (a dish) made differently. Would 
they rather have tomatoes on their hamburgers? Do they want more oranges? Then 
I adjust around the federal requirements and set up menus based on what they 
want. I'd rather have something the kids are going to eat," says Ridgway. 
"Calories in stomach are better that something nutritious that sits on a plate 
and ends up going in the trash. Some districts put (a commodity item) on the 
menu just because they don't have to pay for it. I want to make sure the kids 
are going to eat it."

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
Pre-plating eliminates the need for employees at schools in the San Francisco 
Unified district. This makes it possible for district director of school 
nutrition, Richard Farrar to maintain control of expenses. It also makes for 
more rigid menus. "It's like getting an airplane meal," Farrar complains, "but 
we're forced into doing it because of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Farrar does have a nutrition education specialist who helps develop a single 
menu for all schools based upon the likes of the children. They have reduced 
the amount of fat, sugar and salt in most recipes -- but not so much that the 
students won't eat the food. Ground turkey and ground beef are combined in meat 
dishes; pizza dough is made with part whole-wheat, part all-purpose flour. "We 
tried (an all) whole-wheat pizza (crust) . . . and the sale of pizza went down. 
But it came right back up again and it's been steady ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to put food inside the children. We certainly don't want to serve 
certain items that will go in the garbage can. Kids have to take arithmetic and 
social studies and they don't have to take cafeteria," he says, then adds, "if 
we don't have any business, we reduce (labor) hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMPTON 
</P>
<P>
This district has one of the highest participation rates in the state -- but 
not because of the director's ingenuity. About 93% of the students receive free 
or reduced price meals. The district is also one of the few remaining districts 
with on-site kitchens, allowing it the flexibility to develop recipes tailored 
to student preferences. 
</P>
<P>
But because of past problems with individual school workers who inadvertently 
eliminated parts of the lunch (a violation of the federal Minimum Meal Pattern 
Requirements, and one that prevents reimbursement), Compton now follows a 
standardized program. Consistency has become the main goal; choice is 
sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
The program is coordinated by an outside food service management company; 
managers at all school kitchens prepare lunches according to USDA recipes that 
are designed to make the best use of commodity items. Compton purchases most 
baked goods, which are supplied by a bakery company (corn bread is made on-site 
according to USDA specifications). 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a school may offer a "managers' choice" day, in order to use 
excess items stored in the freezer. But in general, "The schools follow a 
standardized cycle one Type A menu," says Frank Day, food service 
administrator. "We wanted things more standardized to make sure we stay within 
the guidelines of the National School Lunch Program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND * In California, a school is reimbursed $1.60 for every free lunch 
it provides, $1.21 for each reduced-price lunch and 16 cents for each lunch a 
student pays full price for. These figures are adjusted 2 cents when 60% of the 
school receives free and reduced price lunches. As part of the reimbursement, 
schools also receive surplus food items such as ground beef, turkey, chicken, 
canned fruits, fruit juices, beans, raisins, vegetable shortening, bulk butter, 
peanut products, grain products and flour.

NEWS BITES : RAT DEATHS FUEL PEPPER FEARS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lab rats die of respiratory failure if fed large enough doses of Louisiana hot 
sauce, reports the scientific journal Toxicon. The lethal dose works out to 
half a cup of sauce per 10 pounds of body weight, so play it safe, OK? If you 
weigh 140 pounds, don't drink more than a quart and a half of straight Tabasco 
at one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
You should probably stay away from those chug-a-lug contests altogether. Note, 
however, that these figures are for drinking hot sauce. It would take less -- 
maybe as little as four cups of Tabasco -- to kill a 140-pound individual if it 
was injected with a hypodermic needle. If anybody suggests "shooting up a quart 
of red" . . . Just Say No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unloaded Garlic 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kotaro Sakai, a Japanese soil researcher, has patented a way of pickling 
garlic said to leave all the flavor while preventing "garlic breath." The Wall 
Street Journal reports that a company in Strausstown, Penn., markets Dr. Sakai 
Garlic made according to his recipe at $1.50 per two-bulb package. There is 
debate, however, as to how effective the pickling process is, both from the 
flavor and the breath angles. 
</P>
<P>
But here's one question nobody's been asking: How do we know odorless garlic is 
any good against vampires? Do we want to wake up some night to the sound of 
scratching at our windowpanes and reach for a clove of garlic, only to find 
it's unloaded? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparkling Moo 
</P>
<P>
Ranjit S. Kadan, an Agriculture Department food researcher, claims to have 
perfected carbonated milk. "One reason people don't like milk," he says, "is 
that it has a very bland taste and the milk protein coats your tongue and 
leaves a blah taste." His solution involves adding not only the perky 
refreshment of bubbles but the allure of fruit flavors to make a sort of canned 
soda. A year from now, he predicts, carbonated milk could be in the markets on 
the same shelves as Coke and Pepsi. 
</P>

<P>
Sprays to Savor 
</P>
<P>
Now there are flavored Pam-type frying pan sprays. Creative's Naturally Light 
sprays, which contain only 6% saturated fat (as against 52% for rendered beef 
tallow), come in the following flavors: Real Butter Flavor with canola oil, 
Real Garlic with olive oil, and Canola with canola oil, which might be going 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Paws That Refresh 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola has been called the American vin de pays, and many people cook with 
it just as if it were wine -- there are Coke-spiked recipes for gingerbread, 
sweet and sour cabbage, meatloaf and so on. Add one more to the list. From 
Taiwan comes a recipe for Fried Frog Legs with Sweet Bean Paste that includes a 
teaspoon of Coke per pair of legs.

Frozen Breakfast News

is trying out a microwavable breakfast in New England; Aunt Jemima Lite 
Breakfast consists of four lite pancakes and two lite sausage links.

MENUS: THE LITTLEST FOOD CRITICS -- CATERERS COME UP WITH NEW TWISTS ON OLD 
FAVORITES IN AN ATTEMPT TO PLEASE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having a hard time figuring out what to pack in your child's lunch box? You're 
not alone. When we asked some of the best caterers in town to come up with 
interesting new ideas for school lunches, the repetition was amazing. There 
were lots of peanut butter sandwiches, chicken or turkey in abundance, and more 
celery than you can shake a stick at. For dessert -- cookies, of course. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson here; these caterers understand the aesthetics of eating. They 
know that no food critic is more exacting (or more of a traditionalist) than a 
child, and that the last thing any kid wants is to show up at school with Mom's 
latest experiment. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to kids, caterers know enough to stick with the tried and true. 
And we know that if you try these recipes, your kids will be very happy when 
lunchtime rolls around.

BACK TO BASICS: IF IT'S NOT A SLUMP OR A GRUNT: IT MUST BE A COBBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Recipes that have been around a long time have a tendency to spawn variations 
or even become a blend of similar dishes. Fruit cobbler is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
This all-American dessert is a first cousin to both the deep-dish pie and 
pandowdy. In all three, sugared fruit is covered with a rich biscuit crust, 
then baked. Other similar desserts include grunt, slump, buckle and flummery. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation shortcuts are another typical evolution of classic recipes. Often 
these changes save time and effort without adversely affecting the end product. 
But not always. 
</P>
<P>
Recently we discovered that modern cobbler recipes often omit the step of 
precooking the fruit. Placing the biscuit dough over hot fruit, however, cooks 
it faster and the crust is less likely to become soggy. So in this instance, 
the few extra minutes of preparation are worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Peeling the fruit for a cobbler is optional. Combine it in a saucepan with 
sugar and a tablespoon of flour and cook over low heat until the fruit is hot 
and tender. The exact amount of sugar and length of cooking will vary depending 
on the sweetness and ripeness of the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The mixture should be brought to a boil so there will be no raw flour flavor. 
Then reduce the heat to a simmer. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the hot fruit into a baking dish (Step 1), sprinkle with cinnamon to taste 
and dot with small pats of butter (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
A variety of crust styles are used for cobblers. Thinner batter can be spooned 
(Step 3) over the fruit and left rough (or cobbled). 
</P>
<P>
More dense dough may be cut into biscuits and placed on top (Step 4) or small 
pieces of dough may be pinched off, pressed between your fingers, then placed 
over the fruit like cobblestones (Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
The most traditional method is to roll out the biscuit dough and place it over 
the fruit (Step 6), then pinch the dough to the rim of the pan. Whatever crust 
style is preferred, cobbler is best served warm from the oven with cream, 
whipped cream or ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH PEACH COBBLER 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup milk, about 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 cups sliced peaches 
</P>
<P>
Ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder and salt in bowl. Cut in 3 tablespoons 
butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in enough milk to make soft dough. Transfer to lightly floured surface and 
knead 4 or 5 times. Roll dough out to 11x8-inch rectangle. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon flour in saucepan. Add peach slices 
and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, 5 minutes or until fruit is hot 
and tender. 
</P>
<P>
Pour hot fruit into 10x7-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Dot with 
remaining 1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Place rolled dough over fruit, pinching dough to rim of pan. Bake at 425 
degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until browned. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To drop dough by spoonfuls, increase milk to 3/4 cup and omit kneading.

YOU ASKED ABOUT . . . : THE PAVLOVA PREDICAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Every time I bake Pavlova in my springform pan I have sugar syrup 
leak out onto the bottom of my oven. Would appreciate learning how I might 
alleviate this problem. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Are you lining the pan with wax paper? First cut a circle to fit the 
bottom, then cut a strip about two inches wider than the pan is deep and use it 
to line the sides of the pan. Grease the wax paper well, dip your hand into 
cold water and shake over the prepared pan. 
</P>
<P>
Another cause could be improper beating of the egg whites. The mixture must be 
glossy and stand in stiff peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Oven temperature is a third critical factor in making Pavlova. It should puff 
up by the end of the first 15 minutes of baking at 350 degrees. If it doesn't, 
bake 10 to 15 minutes longer and then, if your oven holds heat well, turn it 
off and let the Pavlova stand in the oven for an hour. If your oven doesn't 
hold the heat, lower the temperature to 175 degrees and let the Pavlova bake 
another hour. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I attended a church social where the punch bowl literally "smoked." One of 
the women told me it was done with "hot ice," but she could not tell me how. 
Can you? 
</P>
<P>
A: We suspect the trick was done with "dry," rather than "hot" ice. Dry ice is 
carbon dioxide that is solidified and compressed into snowlike cakes and used 
primarily as a refrigerant. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dee Gramlich, a spokesperson for the Union Ice Company, dry ice 
should not be placed directly in a punch bowl. If a piece breaks off and is 
accidentally swallowed along with the punch, it might become lodged and freeze 
the throat or can cause a severe burn to the throat or stomach. 
</P>
<P>
You may, however, produce the smoke effect by placing the punch bowl in a 
larger bowl containing dry ice, then pour hot water over the dry ice. The 
hotter the water the better, said Gramlich, and add water as frequently as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Two other precautions to keep in mind when using dry ice: handle it with gloves 
or protective paper, not bare hands, and never use it to chill punch in a 
closed container; it could cause an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm making a mid-life career change -- from financial accountant to 
(hopefully) chef. Have been unable to find addresses for culinary schools. 
Would appreciate your assistance in locating some directories with listings. 
Location is no barrier, but English speaking is preferred. 
</P>
<P>
A: Two sources may be of assistance: "The Food Yellow Pages," 1988 Los Angeles 
Edition, and "The Guide to Cooking Schools," 1990 Edition. Both are available 
at Cook's Library, 8373 W. 3rd Street, Los Angeles, (213) 655-3141. The store

FIRST MAYOR APPOINTED FOR MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SOME SEE THE CHOICE OF WALT KELLER AS A BID TO MEND COUNCIL RIFTS, 
BUT CITYHOOD LIMBO MAKES LENGTH OF TERM UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, Malibu's unofficial City Council has selected Walt Keller 
to be mayor-elect of the seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Keller, the top vote-getter in June's incorporation election, was 
viewed by some observers as a conciliatory gesture aimed at healing a rift 
between quarrelsome factions of the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the political paralysis we've experienced is due to a certain amount 
of personal tension over (who was to be appointed mayor), and I wanted to 
remove that obstacle and hope to get the council more united," said 
Councilman-elect Larry Wan, who offered the motion to appoint Keller at 
Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Wan and council members Mike Caggiano and Missy Zeitsoff, long associated with 
the Malibu Township Council, have frequently been at odds with Keller and 
Carolyn Van Horn, who, before being elected to the council, co-chaired the 
Malibu Committee for Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Since they began to hold informal council meetings after voters overwhelmingly 
approved cityhood, they have split 3 to 2 so often that their votes have become 
almost predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said Wednesday that he was "surprised and pleased" by the appointment, 
saying he was "hopeful that it is a sign that we are coming together." 
</P>
<P>
However, in the excitement over Wan's unexpected motion and the panel's 
unanimous approval, confusion remained Wednesday about the specifics of the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
As approved by the council, the mostly honorary title of mayor will be rotated 
among the council members each year, commencing with municipal elections held 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
But Malibu is not yet a city, and the council members, although they have 
continued to meet since the election, are unable to take office until cityhood 
occurs. Despite efforts by cityhood backers to speed incorporation, Los Angeles 
County has thus far prevailed in court in its bid to block the actual 
incorporation until next March 28, hoping to start work on an unpopular sewer 
system there before the new city government has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
If the county succeeds in forcing the delay, the new mayor-elect may only be 
mayor for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said Wednesday that he understood the council's action to mean that he 
will be mayor until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I assumed I would be mayor for a year from the time we're actually a city," he 
said. "I think that would be the appropriate thing. If it turns out that 
they're suggesting something different, I would hope we can work something 
out." 
</P>
<P>
However, Wan, who was appointed mayor pro tem on Tuesday, said Keller's term 
will expire next April, regardless of when Malibu becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt has always wanted to be Malibu's first mayor, and the action we took 
fulfills that," he said. "Unfortunately, we're in a strange situation where, 
because of the uncertainty of cityhood, everyone's term on the council stands 
to be shortened, and his term as mayor is one of those things that may be 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
Keller's supporters have long insisted that since he won the most votes, he 
should be appointed mayor, and have noted that in all but one of the last dozen 
cities to incorporate in Los Angeles County, the highest vote-getter became 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
They were upset in June after the Township Council faction said they preferred 
to wait until after incorporation to choose a mayor. Since then, the five 
council members have taken turns chairing their weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Besides choosing a mayor-elect, the council also made progress on several other 
issues Tuesday over which they have long been divided. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the council approved a lease for City Hall space in 
Malibu's main commercial area, a two-story office building at 23805 Stewart 
Ranch Road that Keller and Van Horn had previously opposed in hopes of working 
out a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
After renegotiating the five-year lease for 1,275 square feet of office space 
to allow the future city to end the lease after two years if it chooses, Keller 
and Van Horn gave their support. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council also voted to begin negotiating a contract with former 
Southgate City Manager Bruce Spragg as interim city manager. The vote was 4 to 
1, with Keller dissenting.

SMALL WONDERS;

<P>
IT MAY BE THE LITTLE MISS OF AMERICA PAGEANT, BUT THE PRESSURE, LEVEL OF 
COMPETITION AND STAKES ARE ENORMOUS.

Austin Sponsel strode across the stage with the practiced moves of a 
professional runway model, the one-piece white bathing suit contrasting sharply 
with her black sunglasses. After a few spins, she turned her back to the crowd 
and shot the judges her favorite pose -- her face tilted rakishly downward, her 
long blond curls swept smartly to one side. 
</P>
<P>
It was the work of a pro. Her mother stood in the wings, smiling approvingly. 
They both knew the routine so well -- after all, the reigning Mrs. Minnesota 
and her daughter practiced it so often together. But Sheila Sponsel already had 
her crown. Her daughter was still shooting for hers. 
</P>
<P>
Not that a pedigree makes life any easier on the national beauty pageant 
circuit. Future fame exacts a price, even if, like Austin, you are only 6 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Austin was one of nearly two hundred girls and boys competing for fame, cash 
and prizes at the annual Little Miss of America Pageant at the Century Plaza 
Hotel last weekend. The pageant showcases some of the nation's most talented 
tykes and teens and offers casting agents a veritable pastry cart filled with 
fresh-faced clients. 
</P>
<P>
But the ages are about all that separate this spectacle from the grown-up 
beauty pageants. The pressure is great, the rivalries real, the stage mothers 
abundant. When the room contains enough Shirley Temple look-alikes to sink the 
Good Ship Lollipop, sometimes you've got to push a little harder to take your 
moppet to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not necessarily working on winning each of these pageants," Sheila 
Sponsel said. "You're looking at developing poise and the ability to perform. 
But I'm a businesswoman, and I know that you can't wish for things to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous amount of work. You have to train hard and practice so much 
that it looks natural. But when you get to this level, there's a lot of 
pressure. There always is when you're competing." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Regan, whose daughter Chelsea has been competing against Austin Sponsel 
for years, said she quit her job in order to devote herself to the pageant 
circuit full time. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm investing in her future," the Minnesota resident said. 
"Ultimately, the goal is to land a career in modeling or commercials, but it's 
hard work. You have to decide which audition to take her out of school for, 
make sure that she gets to all the pageants on time and try and make sure that 
it's still fun for them." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Gibson, a former Miss Oklahoma, started the national pageant in 1979, and 
the event has grown so much that this year they had to move to a larger hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The pageant, based in Beverly Hills (where else?), offers titles for Tiny Miss, 
Little Miss, Master, Young Miss, and Miss Teen, as well as prizes ranging from 
a Burbank apartment (six months' free rent) to an interview with a top 
Hollywood casting agency. Although all the divisions are competitive, most of 
the entrants and casting agents eye the Tiny Miss talents, the mostly adorable 
3- to 6-year-olds who might might someday exchange wisecracks with Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the kids have yet to become household names, it's not for lack 
of trying. Many of the contestants already have agents, have done commercials 
and some have done films. Beverly Hills resident Tina Brosius, a three-year 
veteran of the circuit, recently completed a movie called "Kindergarten Cop" 
with Arnold Schwarzenegger. And when most children are watching "Winnie the 
Pooh," these children are perfecting the lyrics to songs like "Top Hat" with 
their voice coaches. 
</P>
<P>
For most of their parents, it's a large business expense. In lieu of an entry 
fee, pageant contestants pay up to $350 to have their photo included in the 
pageant catalogue. Throw in air fare, hotel expenses, clothes and other 
essentials, and each stop on the multi-legged tour costs about $4,000. Tina's 
wardrobe alone is worth about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids have aspirations to break into the industry," Gibson said. 
"They see it as a stepping stone to the business. We try not to stress winning 
as much as provide a forum in which they can perform for people already working 
in entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
That's why, following the swimwear competition, Austin Sponsel spent several 
hours rehearsing two routines for the talent segment of the pageant. She was 
competing against a lineup featuring industry professionals, girls who have 
been modeling, tap dancing, singing and acting for years -- or in this case, 
for more than half of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in sequined tuxedos, elaborate party dresses and all manner of ruffled 
outfits, these kids belted out Broadway melodies and tap-danced up and down 
stairs. Some tap-danced up and down stairs while belting out Broadway melodies. 
Austin did the only stand-up comedy routine, which focused on her future 
presidential candidacy. ("I must be the only presidential candidate in history 
who has to wait for her Cabinet to be born.") 
</P>
<P>
The pageants sometimes take their toll. Deborah Hansen's daughter, Amber, was 
so tired she nearly fell asleep in the hotel ballroom while the other kids were 
on stage. Another girl broke down in tears right on center stage as she was 
scheduled to begin her routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exhausting schedule," Hansen said. "These kids really work hard and it 
shows because there is some fabulous talent here. But it's tough. There's so 
much pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen decided to escape and took her daughter to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila and Austin Sponsel stuck it out. The 6-year-old impressed the judges, 
but against a lineup of professionals, she fell back into the pack. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, it was Tina Brosius' turn to shine. With dozens of pageants under 
her belt, more than 300 national awards and numerous television and print 
commercials to her credit, Tina can cry on cue and belt out "Ain't He Sweet" at 
the first casting director's call. 
</P>
<P>
Her version of "The Tennessee Waltz" was such a knockout that even the judges, 
most of them professional casting agents, were motionless. 
</P>
<P>
And when she finished, it was clear that all those years of voice and acting 
lessons, auditions and rehearsals had finally paid off. Tina took home the 
talent trophy and was named 1990 Tiny Miss of America. 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Tina's mom, Beverly, announced that Tina would now retire from 
the circuit -- at least until she's eligible for the Miss America Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it for the experience of performing on stage," she said. "Whatever you 
want to say about the pageants, the kids learn a lot from them, and they learn 
it fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's time for Tina to get out because it's not fair, Tina is a 
professional now. She's already got her SAG (Screen Actors Guild) card. It's 
time to let the other kids compete."

NONPARTISAN COUNCIL RACE GETS PARTISAN; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: AN AIDE TO REPUBLICAN SUPERVISOR DEANE DANA IS CHALLENGING RUTH 
GALANTER. BUT MARY LEE GRAY'S DEVELOPMENT STAND REMAINS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little more than three years ago, a neighborhood activist named Ruth Galanter 
rode a wave of public anger about rampant development onto the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Since Galanter took office, the development pressure has, if anything, 
intensified. The Westside councilwoman, conceding that a certain amount of 
development is inevitable, has traded in her initial hostility toward 
developers in favor of a more conciliatory approach. In recent months, her 
focus has been on making certain big projects more palatable to the community 
through negotiations with developers on issues of size, traffic and housing. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not surprising that the first-term councilwoman would face a 
reelection challenge from a critic of her handling of development issues. What 
is surprising is where the first serious challenge is coming from: not from the 
ranks of neighborhood activists charging betrayal, but from the office of a 
Republican, pro-development county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months before voters go to the polls in April, Mary Lee Gray, a senior 
deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, made it official last week 
that she will take on Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Gray, a Republican, sets the stage for a partisan race in 
the heavily Democratic district that runs from the beaches of Venice and Playa 
del Rey inland through Mar Vista, Del Rey and Westchester, and over the Baldwin 
Hills into to Crenshaw area. The district also includes Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the Ballona Creek bicycle trail, Gray accused Galanter 
of a lack of leadership in failing to solve problems ranging from traffic 
congestion to crime, air pollution to aircraft noise, graffiti to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list was what Gray called "the 'G' word." 
</P>
<P>
"Growth and development split the 6th District in the last campaign," she said. 
"It may well do it again." 
</P>
<P>
But just where Gray stands on the growth issue is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by two dozen supporters, some carrying hand-lettered campaign signs, 
Gray sounded alarm at the prospects of massive building along heavily-congested 
Lincoln Boulevard corridor. She was sharply critical of Galanter for 
negotiating privately with developers of the Channel Gateway and Playa Vista 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Her possible 'deals' with developers and special interests and non-public 
negotiations on projects that adversely affect the public is a breach of public 
trust," Gray said. "Wasn't it Ruth Galanter that promised to slow development 
when she ran for office?" 
</P>
<P>
Gray praised Channel Gateway's plan to include 109 affordable apartment units. 
But unlike Galanter, Gray said she would have voted against the high-rise 
residential and office project because of its size. She also was critical of a 
$1.25-million agreement between Galanter's office and developer Jerome Snyder. 
The money is to be distributed to area groups for community improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Gray agreed with Galanter's opposition to the Marina Place shopping mall in 
Culver City, but she said Los Angeles' lawsuit against the project might have 
been avoided had there been better communication between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
As sailboats glided by in the Marina del Rey Channel, Gray, 49, spoke of the 
need to protect the quality of life. But she took no position on the 
multibillion-dollar Playa Vista project. Instead, she offered only questions 
about potential effects of the city-within-a-city planned for more than 600 
acres between Marina del Rey and the Westchester Bluffs. "Before I could 
approve of such a project, these issues would have to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, no longer the outsider, said she will defend her record. "I intend to 
win reelection by doing my job and doing it well," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
With growth and development looming as a dominant issue, the incumbent issued a 
challenge to the challenger. "I'm prepared to talk about any of the 
developments in the district," Galanter said. "I'm willing to talk about it 
anywhere . . . as long as I can fit it in my schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said that if growth is going to be the issue, Gray must take a 
position. And if crime, gangs and graffiti are issues, she said, the challenger 
must offer solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Although City Council races are supposed to be nonpartisan, Galanter served 
notice that she will attempt to draw the political connection between Gray and 
Dana. "She works for him. How much more of a tie can you get?" Galanter asked. 
"Mary Lee Gray is about as independent as Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Galanter and Dana have been strained over a variety of 
issues, many of them related to county plans for development in and near Marina 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing that the race could be clouded by party labels, Gray sought to distance 
herself from her boss of the last 10 years. "I am an independent person," she 
told reporters. "I am not Deane Dana. I am Mary Lee Gray." 
</P>
<P>
Gray criticized Galanter for indulging in guilt by association, and she warned 
against such negative campaigning. Gray noted that she has worked for three 
county supervisors during the last 17 years, including Republicans James Hayes 
and Dana, and Democrat Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
But the race could take on a heavily partisan flavor if Gray taps traditional 
Republican sources for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Dana spokesman Dennis Morefield said he did not know what role the supervisor 
will play in Gray's campaign. "I'm sure he will be supportive of her," 
Morefield said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray formed a campaign committee Tuesday to begin raising money for the coming 
campaign. She hopes to raise between $100,000 and $200,000 for her battle 
against the councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has a substantial head start in fund raising, having held a 
$500-a-person reception early this year at a posh club atop the Wells Fargo 
Center in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The event, the biggest of the 49-year-old councilwoman's political career, 
attracted scores of well-heeled developers and City Hall lobbyists. In her 
latest campaign contribution report, Galanter reported raising $84,285 in the 
first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a strong sign of Democratic support, she received $500 contributions from 
Reps. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and Mel 
Levine of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter returned $3,200 in campaign contributions collected from attorneys by 
Nelson C. Rising, senior partner in Maguire Thomas Partners, developers of 
Playa Vista. Galanter has said she will not accept contributions from 
developers of controversial projects in her district. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign committee spent $24,914 in the first half of the year and had 
$70,899 in cash on hand at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
The race is expected to attract other candidates, including Salvatore 
Grammatico, a neighborhood activist who heads the Coalition of Concerned 
Communities. Grammatico said, however, that he is still working to pay off the 
debt from the 1987 council race, when he was in the field of candidates beaten 
by Galanter.

A SUMMER IN THE PITS; 
</P>
<P>
FOSSILS: EACH YEAR AT HANCOCK PARK, VOLUNTEERS DIG UP MORE CLUES ABOUT LIFE ON 
PREHISTORIC EARTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The stirring sounds of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" filled the air as the 
fossil-hunters climbed one last time out of Pit 91, the nation's only regularly 
excavated tar pit. 
</P>
<P>
Every summer since 1984 volunteers have pulled Ice Age fossils from the bowels 
of Hancock Park. As chief excavator Eric Scott explained, it's traditional to 
end each successful season by playing the music associated with Indiana Jones, 
the movie hero who makes the hot, tedious work of excavation look glamorous. A 
wrap party with pizza and beer is also planned. 
</P>
<P>
The haul from this summer's dig, which ended Sunday, was 552 specimens, 
including thefossilized bones of long-extinct saber-toothed cats, dire wolves 
and Ice Age condors, caught in the gooey asphalt that has been trapping animals 
for at least 40,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
That was considerably fewer than last season's total of 746 animal and plant 
specimens, Scott said. But it included an unusually large number of big bones. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, volunteer Gary Takeuchi, a geology student at Cal State Los Angeles, 
removed the season's prize, a finely preserved dire wolf skull. Its worn teeth 
indicated an animal that had managed to beat the ancient odds and survive until 
old age. "Spectacular," Scott called the find. 
</P>
<P>
Originally excavated almost a century ago, the tar pits constitute one of the 
richest caches of Ice Age fossils in the world. Preserved by the asphalt that 
ensnared them, 550 species of plants and animals have been recovered from more 
than 100 sites in the Hancock Park area. 
</P>
<P>
The summer dig has been an annual event since it began in 1984 to coincide with 
the Olympics. A $6,000 budget only allows for a nine-week dig. Summer is the 
preferred time, Scott explained, because the asphalt softens in the heat and 
more volunteers are available. 
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher A. Shaw, who coordinates the summer dig for the George 
C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, one reason Pit 91 was reopened in 1969 
was to redress the bias of early paleontologists toward large remains, called 
macrofossils. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 1 million specimens removed from the tar pits by early 
excavators, less than 1% were of plants or animals smaller than a rabbit, Shaw 
said. Unlike the pits' first excavators, today's scientists treasure insect 
parts and other microfossils. These small remains often reveal more about the 
ancient environment than large finds do, in part because small creatures tend 
to stay closer to home than large ones. 
</P>
<P>
Although fossilized pollen may be a boon to science, it typically doesn't get 
the adrenaline pumping like coming upon a mastodon bone. 
</P>
<P>
"We were taking out saber-toothed cat bones that were bigger than the bones in 
my body," said Scott, 28. "It was a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing rubber boots, hard hats and their grubbiest clothes, the first pair of 
18 volunteers began digging July 5, 13 feet down in a 28-by-28-foot pit 
redolent of asphalt. A tarp protected them from the sun but allowed the public 
a clear view from the observation station at ground level. As each fossil was 
painstakingly removed, some with dental picks, Scott made careful field notes, 
including a record of exactly how each specimen was positioned when found. The 
note-taking isn't sexy but it's crucial, he indicated. The excavator has to 
preserve information, such as a bone's orientation, that the dig itself 
destroys, preserving data to answer questions that may not have been asked yet. 
</P>
<P>
Sabertooth bones were especially plentiful this year, Scott said. Evidence of 
four different individuals was uncovered, including one whose water-worn bones 
suggest that the animal may have died somewhere else and been swept to the site 
by an ancient stream. 
</P>
<P>
The saber-toothed cat, whose skull appears on T-shirts that only volunteer 
excavators are allowed to buy and wear, has been extinct for 10,000 years and 
is especially interesting because nothing quite like it now exists. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said this summer's finds included four sabertooth atlases, the top 
vertebra of the neck. The boomerang shape of the neck bones bolsters the theory 
that the ferocious sabertooth had a much more powerfully muscled neck than such 
contemporaries as the North American lion, whose atlas was smaller and more 
compact. 
</P>
<P>
Information about the 552 newly found specimens will end up in the Page 
Museum's growing data base on Pit 91, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Data on 48,000 specimens already taken from Pit 91 are now being computerized. 
The project will give scientists instant access to information that, in the 
past, was sometimes buried again in the museum's files.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
'DRUNK BUMPS' URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of an area bicycle safety organization on Wednesday called for the 
placement of safety bumps along the side of Pacific Coast Highway to help 
prevent accidents, such as the one that killed Malibu triathlete Tracy Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
The small divider bumps, also called "drunk bumps," are designed to separate 
car and bicycle traffic along the shoulder of a road by alerting drivers that 
they are passing into bike lanes, said Pat Hines, executive director of the 
nonprofit group, Safe Moves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bet you Tracy would be alive today if those bumps were there," Hines said 
at a news conference. Hines said the bumps could be installed cheaply along the 
coastal highway from Santa Monica to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke was killed July 29 by a car driven by a motorist who was later arrested 
on suspicion of drunk driving. She and friends were riding bicycles along the 
northbound shoulder of the coastal highway. 
</P>
<P>
Hines said she became involved in bicycle safety programs after the death of 
her friend, Sue Latham, in a similar accident in 1981 on Pacific Coast Highway. 
Since then, she said, her repeated efforts to get the California Department of 
Transportation to post warning signs or take other precautions have failed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no warning signs or any indications at all that cyclists use that 
shoulder," Hines said. "This is the second time a woman has been killed there, 
and Caltrans has done nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Bork, chief of traffic operations for Caltrans in Los Angeles, said he was 
not aware of any request from Hines' organization concerning warning signs or 
safety bumps, but he said the agency would look into the issue.

FUND-RAISER FOR EXODUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home meetings in the Beverly Hills-West Los Angeles area have raised more than 
$2 million toward Operation Exodus, the Jewish community's fund-raising drive 
to help emigrants from the Soviet Union, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gunther, co-chair of the local campaign, said Los Angeles-area donors 
have come up with almost $22 million toward a goal of $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The home parlor meetings have been so successful because individual 
contributors recognize the peril of the Soviet Jews and are responding in a 
heartfelt way," Gunther said. 
</P>
<P>
Funds raised help pay for transportation from the Soviet Union, housing, job 
training, language classes and other relocation expenses.

SCHOOL BUDGET APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Unified School District board approved a tight $16.8-million 
budget for the coming school year, which includes increases for campus security 
and books and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The budget compares to last year's budget of $16.9 million, which included a 
reserve of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district's $65,000 security program, which includes two full-time night 
guards and several part-time campus supervision aides, was increased by $42,200 
to add a security manager and two full-time day security guards, chief 
financial officer James Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes $7.7 million for the salaries of the district's 240 
teachers, librarians, counselors and nurses. That figure does not provide for 
any pay increases, Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
A part-time education technologist and two part-time special education slots 
were cut from last year, Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources of funds include about $15 million from the state, including $760,000 
from the lottery. The district is also getting $2.35 million from the Culver 
City Redevelopment Agency, most of it in a one-time payment. 
</P>
<P>
He said there may be more money coming from the state. It is not yet clear 
whether school districts will receive the 4.75% cost-of-living increase for 
schools approved by the Legislature, or the 3% allowance approved by Gov. 
George Deukmejian in the final version of the state's fiscal 1990-91 budget.

PIPELINE WORK EXPECTED TO TIE UP TRAFFIC; 
</P>
<P>
MOBIL OIL: IMPACT REPORT SUGGESTS SUSPENDING WORK DURING RUSH HOURS, 
UNDERGROUND TUNNELING AND NIGHT WORK IN NON-RESIDENTIAL AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From A Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of Mobil Oil Corp.'s proposed new pipeline would create 
bumper-to-bumper traffic -- and in some instances gridlock -- in the San 
Fernando Valley and on the Westside, according to an environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends mitigation measures, such as suspending construction work 
during rush hours, tunneling underground where utility lines allow, and working 
at night in industrial and commercial neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But those suggestions offered little assurance to some traffic-weary activists, 
who predicted that commuting during work on the $88-million project will go 
from bad to worse -- particularly because at least one lane in roadways and 
intersections will have to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't do that in already gridlocked streets," said Don Schultz, 
president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. "I don't understand how they can do 
this work, regardless of the hours, without impacting the traffic flow." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz and others also said they remain deeply skeptical of Mobil's motives in 
replacing an existing, deteriorating, pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh in the minds of opponents is the failed attempt two years ago by a group 
of oil companies to build the so-called Angeles Pipeline, which would have 
brought 330,000 barrels of crude oil a day 135 miles south from Bakersfield to 
the Los Angeles Basin. The plan failed because of community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil was not part of the Angeles Pipeline consortium and its proposed, 92-mile 
pipeline would be narrower than the L.A. project. However, the new Mobil 
pipeline still would increase by a third the current pipeline's capacity, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
The existing pipeline, which ranges in size from 10 to 16 inches wide, carries 
about 60,000 barrels of crude oil a day. The new pipeline, which would be a 
standard 16 inches in diameter, would carry more than 90,000 barrels a day, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the project said they not only fear breaks and leaks in their 
neighborhoods but that the larger pipeline could be used by Mobil later to 
justify an expansion of its Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand it needs to be replaced," said Mary Edwards, secretary of the 
North Valley Coalition, "but we hope it's not enlarged, because there is 
certainly no need to bring in more crude oil into this basin, which is already 
the most polluted place in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really frightened they'll be given license to expand under the guise of 
making it safer," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Hargis, who directed the environmental study for the consulting firm Dames 
&amp; Moore, said his staff was told by Mobil in a "very clear statement" that 
there is "no proposed expansion of the refinery in connection with this." 
</P>
<P>
Hargis said the firm's research shows that Mobil's pipeline capacity into 
Torrance exceeds its refinery's production capacity. That means Mobil would 
have to modify the refinery itself to increase output, according to Hargis, who 
said that process would require a separate set of permits and full review. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the new Mobil pipeline would run south from Kern County to 
Torrance, passing through the Westside for about 12 miles, following Sepulveda 
Boulevard most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The report says at least one travel lane in roads and intersections will have 
to be closed to accommodate construction. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the report predicts extensive congestion "during most periods of 
the day" along Sepulveda Boulevard from the San Fernando Valley through 
Sepulveda Pass all the way to the Marina Freeway interchange in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that many Sepulveda Boulevard intersections already suffer 
"overcapacity conditions" at rush hour. During construction, vehicles traveling 
on Sepulveda toward the following intersections can expect to wait through 
several light changes before getting through Wilshire, Olympic, Pico, National, 
Venice, Washington and Santa Monica boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will also aggravate congestion at Slauson and Jefferson 
boulevards, and will restrict access to the nearby Fox Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
The interruptions at a given site would last from about a week to three weeks, 
Hargis said, and the entire project, from Kern County to Torrance, would take 
about 18 months.

GET SMART: PLAYER OF '90S MUST MAKE THE GRADES; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: AS ACADEMIC STANDARDS INCREASE, POTENTIAL RECRUITS' CLASSROOM 
PERFORMANCE WILL BE AS IMPORTANT AS THEIR PLAY ON THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
It's a foregone conclusion that the prep football player of the 1990s will be 
bigger, faster and stronger, but the biggest difference of all, according to 
coaches, is that he will have to be a lot smarter if he wants to move on to the 
big-time college level. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for certain what the collegiate academic minimum will be for 
incoming football players in 1999, but the guess is that it will be well above 
the current 700 minimum Scholastic Aptitude Test score and 2.0 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas S. Hobbs, a political science professor at UCLA and chairman of the 
NCAA's Academic Requirements Committee, said increasing standards are a sign of 
the times. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's not get anybody worried," Hobbs said. "Any change would allow for 
plenty of lead time." 
</P>
<P>
Lead time or not, USC football Coach Larry Smith said that increased academic 
standards are already having a pronounced effect. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is no longer able to recruit borderline student-athletes, and there 
is growing pressure from his peers to recruit players with higher grade-point 
averages and SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all the Prop. 48 casualties in California, I've been forced to do a 
lot of my recruiting out of state," Smith said. "With all the talent here, I 
should never have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the concern comes from college coaches as the focus shifts from an 
athlete-student to a student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"I monitor how all of my players perform in the classroom," said Harry Welch, 
the coach at Canyon High. "If there's a problem, I make them come into my 
classroom for tutoring before school and on their lunch breaks. As a teacher, 
you have to be concerned about their progress. And as a coach, it's a 
necessity." 
</P>
<P>
Welch learned the hard way. In 1982, his first year at Canyon, nearly half of 
his starters were declared ineligible before a playoff game. The Cowboys went 
on to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The situation infuriated Welch and he decided to take an active role in 
players' academic affairs. He hasn't had an eligibility problem since. 
</P>
<P>
Even at traditionally strong academic private schools, such as Loyola and 
Crespi, athletes are increasingly taking advantage of counselors and tutors who 
help them balance sports and college preparatory courses. 
</P>
<P>
Although most school districts have long followed eligibility standards that 
require athletes to achieve a C average, it was the NCAA's adoption of 
Proposition 48 in 1986 that helped increase academic awareness among high 
school athletes. Under Proposition 48, incoming student-athletes must score at 
least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 18 
</P>
<P>
points on the American College Test and maintain a 2.0 GPA in 11 core courses 
to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, athletes who didn't meet those standards could receive a 
scholarship as freshmen, but they lost a year of eligibility. That rule changed 
last month with the adoption of bylaw 14.3, which does away with partial 
qualifiers. Now, unless a student-athlete meets Proposition 48 requirements, he 
or she won't be able to receive an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Although GPAs, SAT and ACT scores haven't improved for incoming college 
freshman since Proposition 48 took effect, athletes appear to be more 
academically aware. They're fulfilling their core requirements in English, 
math, natural science and social science and taking the college entrance exams 
earlier and more often, according to high school coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the day of the 'dumb jock' stereotype is over," said Fred Strock, 
associate athletic director of academics and social services at UCLA. "It's 
becoming harder and harder to be a dumb jock and maintain eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have become much more involved in the whole process. Parents want to 
make sure their kids get into college, and I see them taking a much more active 
role in their child's education." 
</P>
<P>
Local recruiting specialist Dick Lascola said academics is one of the first 
criteria he evaluates when judging potential recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"There's legislation this year in the NCAA to cut the amount of football 
scholarships," Lascola said. "With increasing competition for scholarships, 
grades become even more important to the college coach. Grades have always been 
a criteria, but now it's more important for a larger majority of the schools." 
</P>
<P>
While academics might be the chief difference in the player of the '90s, 
increased size, speed and a broader knowledge of the game will also be 
trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
Size is a noticeable difference. When Lascola started evaluating football 
recruits in 1976, he said he would look at linemen that were 6-feet-2 and 
bigger. Now he rarely bothers unless they're at least 6-4. Two of the top 
linemen prospects in Southern California this season are Montclair Prep's 
Donovan Roy, who is 6-6, 280 pounds, and Temple City's Matt Gilmour, who is 
6-5, 220. 
</P>
<P>
Other positions have been affected, too. El Toro's Rob Johnson is generally 
regarded as the top quarterback this season, and he is 6-4, 210. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward "bigger is better" is expected to continue as coaches 
emphasize weight training. Weightlifting took off in the 1980s, and there is 
hardly a football program around that doesn't have all of its players on a 
rigorous training schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana Coach Dick Bruich has his players in the weight room year-round, and if 
they don't lift, they don't play. Loyola Coach Steve Grady puts his best 
players in a special weightlifting club, which meets at 6 a.m. three days a 
week in the summer. Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle used to drive his players to a 
gym in Long Beach to lift weights in the 1950s, but now the school has one of 
the biggest weight rooms in the area and a strength coach to monitor the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're stronger you can do more things," Vollnogle said. "You have less 
injuries and you can use more force. Weightlifting really changed a lot of 
elements of the game. We'll continue to look for new lifting techniques to keep 
getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Getting bigger does not mean that players are getting slower, however. Coaches 
have been careful to mix speed workouts with weight-training sessions. Lascola 
said a defensive lineman who is 6-7, 250, won't get many scholarship offers if 
he runs a 40-yard dash in 5.6 seconds. This year's top defensive line recruit, 
Pat Riley of Marrero Shaw High in Louisiana, runs the 40 in 4.4. Most of the 
top prospects run under 5.0. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's top running back, Napolean Kaufman of Lompoc, is the 
defending state champion in the 100 and 200-meter dashes and runs the 40 in 
4.4. He long jumps 24 feet and has great hands. Although he is only 5-9, he can 
dunk a basketball. Kaufman also returns punts and kickoffs and plays defensive 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes knows athletes like Kaufman are the difference 
between a mediocre team and a contender. That is why Los Alamitos' players 
spend plenty of time working on agility drills. A program consisting of 
long-distance runs, sprints and jumping drills is religiously followed. It is 
not uncommon to see Los Alamitos' players running backwards up a hill near the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid comes to Los Alamitos as a freshman and he's 5-11, 165, he'll be 
5-11, 190, as a senior if he sticks with football the whole time," Barnes said. 
"He'll leave here a much better all-around athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes also happens to have one of the most wide-open offenses in the area, 
utilizing a sophisticated passing attack. He built it around former quarterback 
Todd Gragnano, who graduated last year after a banner career. Barnes said his 
players learned the system quickly and he expects them to handle even more 
knowledge in the future as the game becomes more complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is getting better because the coaching is getting better," Barnes 
said. "We also can do more things because the staffs are bigger and the players 
are smarter. They're watching more football on television than they used to, so 
they've seen more things done. By the time we get them, they're better prepared 
than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson has some of the most talented players in 
Southern California. Since many of the school's students come from affluent 
families, they often are able to afford first-class training. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei freshman quarterback Justin Vedder is no physical giant at 5-6, 140, 
but after three years of intense training at the Performance Institute in 
Anaheim, Vedder is receiving a lot of attention from the coaching staff. He 
will start on the freshmen team this season and Rollinson said he has a chance 
to make the varsity next year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a bullet for an arm," Rollinson said. "He's also very mature for his 
age." 
</P>
<P>
At the Performance Institute, Vedder was put on a special training schedule 
catered to his physical abilities and desires. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute is owned and operated by Marv Marinovich, the father of USC 
quarterback Todd Marinovich. Todd often has been referred to as "Robo QB" 
because his athletic career has been so well planned by his father. 
</P>
<P>
Vedder, 15, did not lift weights and run up mountains at the Institute, but 
instead worked on things like developing peripheral vision, flexibility, muscle 
balance and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are is a school that teaches people how to do things like eat, run and 
coordinate their busy schedules," Marinovich said. "We also do psychological 
testing. Our center is not for the everyday average guy who wants to 
participate. We're geared toward the serious athlete who wants to be tops in 
all areas." 
</P>
<P>
Increased competition is forcing the player of the '90s to take advantage of 
new training techniques, such as the one Marinovich uses. Although the 
Performance Institute is the only one of its type in Southern California, 
Marinovich said he expects several more to open in the area in the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Players already are spending more time practicing and preparing for games. 
Major programs demand that players train year-round, taking advantage of 
intense conditioning programs, spring drills and summer passing leagues. Many 
top players limit their athletic participation only to football. The demands 
probably will increase with time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times that to excel past the high school level, you have to 
spend 12 months training for a sport," USC's Smith said. "The competition is 
fierce."

PARENTS' SMOKING LINKED TO CHILDREN'S LUNG CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: EARLY EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE APPEARS TO CAUSE 1 IN 6 CASES IN 
NONSMOKERS, STUDY FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About one in six cases of lung cancer in nonsmokers appears to be caused by 
long-term exposure to secondhand smoke at home during childhood, according to a 
study that for the first time suggests that parents' smoking habits can 
eventually kill their children. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that 
growing up in a household in which two parents regularly smoked could double a 
person's risk of developing the lethal form of cancer later in life. 
</P>
<P>
The finding, which remains to be confirmed in additional studies, adds a new 
dimension to the contentious public debate over the health effects of 
involuntary, or passive, smoking and over the desirability of banning tobacco 
smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it just strengthens the case for limiting environmental tobacco 
smoke," said Dr. Peter Greenwald of the National Cancer Institute, a co-author 
of the paper. "It strengthens the case for policies that protect the freedom of 
people to breathe clean air." 
</P>
<P>
There has long been evidence, though controversial, that some nonsmokers may 
develop lung cancer from living with a smoking spouse. And it is known that 
smokers' children, when young, are especially susceptible to respiratory 
infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
But the new study is the first to find a link between growing up with smokers 
and developing lung cancer decades later, researchers said. If the finding is 
confirmed, they said, it may create a new impetus for people to limit or 
abandon smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in the field said the findings underline the importance of parents not 
smoking in the presence of their children, especially in cars and unventilated 
spaces. They also said physicians must continue to educate parents about how 
they may be harming their children. 
</P>
<P>
"Adults may be more sensitive to an appeal to stop smoking not for their own 
sake but for the sake of protecting their children," said Dr. Ronald M. Davis, 
director of the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dwight T. Janerich, the Yale University epidemiologist who headed the 
study, said about 22,000 nonsmokers develop lung cancer in the United States 
each year, including about 7,000 who never smoked. Of those, 1,500 cases may 
stem from childhood exposure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some earlier studies, Janerich's study did not find any increased 
risk of lung cancer among the nonsmoking spouses of smokers. Nor did it find 
any increased risk from exposure to secondhand smoke in workplaces or social 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the tobacco industry on Wednesday chose to emphasize those 
findings rather than the finding of cancer risk in the children of smokers. 
Like the researchers, they stressed the need for additional studies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tentative finding because they qualified it, I think, very much," 
said Steve Parrish, a vice president at Philip Morris Cos. He contended that 
most studies on the effects of involuntary smoking have turned up "no 
significant increase" in cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
The new study, by researchers from seven institutions, compared 191 nonsmokers 
with lung cancer to 191 healthy nonsmokers who served as controls. The 
researchers collected information on the participants' secondhand-smoke 
exposure at home, at work and in social settings. 
</P>
<P>
They concluded that household exposure to 25 or more "smoker years" -- the 
equivalent of two parents smoking for 12 1/2 years -- during a person's 
childhood and adolescence doubled his or her long-term lung cancer risk. 
Exposure of less than 25 smoker years did not increase the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"This amount of exposure is equivalent to living with more than one smoker 
throughout childhood and adolescence -- a high but not uncommon level of 
exposure," the researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The group concluded that about 17% of all lung cancers in nonsmokers "can be 
attributed to exposure to passive smoke in the household during childhood and 
adolescence." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers do not know the mechanism by which exposure in childhood might 
raise one's cancer risk, but they suggested that the susceptibility of smokers' 
children to respiratory infections might trigger changes in the lungs that lead 
eventually to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
(A 1986 report by the U.S. surgeon general found that infants of parents who 
smoke are more likely than other infants to be hospitalized with bronchitis and 
pneumonia. They also have more frequent respiratory symptoms and a slower rate 
of growth in lung function.) 
</P>
<P>
Specialists in the field said they were not surprised by the finding. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes eminent sense that this is true," said Joseph W. Cullen, director of 
the AMC Cancer Research Center in Denver. "The earlier the exposure and the 
greater the exposure, the greater the probability of disease. So from a 
biological point of view, it makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard J. Jackson, chairman of the committee on environmental hazards for 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: "We've sort of long suspected this 
was going on. . . . I'm glad someone's actually gotten down and done the 
study." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the researchers noted that such studies rely on people's 
recollections and are vulnerable to bias and error. For example, people who 
develop lung cancer may be more likely than healthy people to remember their 
parents' heavy smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the new findings, Dr. David Burns, an associate professor of 
medicine at UC San Diego who served as senior scientific editor for the surgeon 
general's 1986 report on involuntary smoking, suggested that there is "a 
societal responsibility" to limit smoking in schools and day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Forty states now have laws restricting smoking in public places, up from 20 
states in the mid-1970s. More than half of all large companies have policies 
restricting smoking. Smoking has also been banned from 99% of all domestic 
airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
At least two states -- New Jersey and Kansas -- have banned smoking on school 
premises, according to Davis of the Office on Smoking and Health. He called 
day-care centers "an important setting for banning smoking," but said little is 
known on where it is done. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District prohibits students from smoking on 
school grounds, but allows adults to smoke in designated areas, such as faculty 
lounges. 
</P>
<P>
But the Board of Education is considering extending that ban to adults. Board 
members will vote this month on a measure that would forbid smoking by anyone 
on district property -- including campuses, cars and outdoor athletic fields.

LOOTERS SPREAD FEAR IN KUWAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the month they spent in hiding in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, Catherine 
Byiers and her husband, Marshall, took long naps, played Trivial Pursuit and 
built a bomb shelter in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
"We all got organized for the Americans to come," she said in an interview 
Wednesday, the morning after she and more than 300 other British women and 
children arrived in Baghdad by bus from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"If we knew this would only go on a week," she said, "we could cope with the 
idea of a bomb falling on us at the end of it. It's the not knowing that wears 
you away, the endlessness of it." 
</P>
<P>
But not even that was enough to make Byiers leave her husband behind and take 
advantage of President Saddam Hussein's offer of freedom for all foreign women 
and children in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the looters who really convinced me it was time to go," she said. 
"They're 18-to-20-year-old Palestinian kids roaming around in gangs of six or 
eight, scavenging for anything they can find. They're breaking down doors of 
houses and flats they think are abandoned, and they're stealing everything. I 
was nervous all the time, and my husband and I thought, well, I'd better get 
out while I had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
There were similarly chilling accounts from other women who were trapped when 
the Iraqi army swept into Kuwait on Aug. 2 and secured the country within a 
matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with more than a dozen of the women -- most of whom asked not to be 
identified by name to protect the men they left behind -- produced a detailed 
picture of life in occupied Kuwait and of Iraq's plans for the land it has 
annexed. 
</P>
<P>
The women spoke of a growing underground resistance movement among the 
Kuwaitis, men who shoot Iraqi soldiers on the street and organize vocal rooftop 
protests on behalf of their former ruler, the ousted emir. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops reportedly are trying to stop the looting, but the women made it 
clear that there is little left to be looted. And they said that in the first 
days of the occupation there was a good bit of what they called "official 
looting." 
</P>
<P>
Entire government ministries, office buildings, apartment blocks, supermarkets, 
auto showrooms and military camps were stripped of every appliance and 
commodity, anything of use. The loot was loaded on Iraqi army trucks and moved 
north, the women said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, who lived next door to the Ministry of Water and Electricity, said 
the Iraqi troops cleaned out the building in a coordinated operation. 
</P>
<P>
"They worked all through the night," she said. "They came with trucks and 
filled them with typewriters, carpets, computers, desks, chairs, everything." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, who lived in southern Kuwait, said the troops "cleaned out the 
office where my husband works," taking "fax machines, photocopiers, freezers, 
filing cabinets, even a frying pan." 
</P>
<P>
Filipinos, who said they were paid by the Iraqi army to drive trucks from 
Kuwait to Iraq, said their cargoes have included entire stocks from department 
stores: clothing, toiletries and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the Iraqis don't intend to stay," said a British woman who had to 
leave her Kuwaiti husband behind. "They know they won't be staying . . . . 
"They've been taking big army trucks and filling them to the brim and taking 
them to Iraq. Today, as we saw, many truckloads were going with us to Iraq with 
office furniture, house furniture, everything you can think of. Everything has 
gone. Honestly. Everything has gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has denied any widespread looting by Iraqi troops. But 
technically, some Iraqis will argue, one cannot steal what one already owns. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is and has always been a part of Iraq," government spokesman Naji 
Hadithi has said. "It is only the British colonial scissors that cut this line 
between us and what is us and what is ours." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the impressions of the fleeing women, Hadithi and other officials 
insist that there will be no withdrawal, that the presence of Iraqi troops is 
"non-negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
The government has not commented directly on the widespread allegations of 
Kuwaiti goods and property moving into Iraq, but Iraqis who now are trading 
these goods in the bazaars of Baghdad expressed disbelief when questioned on 
the propriety of it. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqis raised on the teachings of Saddam Hussein's Arab Socialist Baath Party 
deeply resent the royal family that ruled over oil-rich Kuwait. Ahmed Abdallah, 
a customer in a bazaar in Baghdad's Mansour district, spoke for many others 
when he told a reporter that the Kuwaitis "treated other Arabs like 
foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
Madria Nasser Mishadani, 40, a schoolteacher, said that "for 20 years we've 
tried to get Kuwait, and now it's ours, and we should keep it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, according to some of the people fleeing Kuwait, there are indications 
that Iraq may be leaving some negotiating room on the question of who owns 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Byiers, who had lived for seven years in Fahaheel, an oil center near the 
border with Saudi Arabia, said there had been no attempt to establish local 
government there or to change any of the official signs. 
</P>
<P>
"But on our way up to the (Iraqi) border," she said, "I noticed they'd taken 
the signs down and were repainting them with new names." 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts here said this suggests that Iraq is consolidating its 
position only in northern Kuwait, along a strip that would give Iraq the rich 
Rumaila oil fields and the two islands in the gulf that would allow it access 
to the shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the fleeing women, whose husbands have continued to work in Kuwait 
city, said the Iraqis appear to be making no real effort to keep the Kuwaiti 
infrastructure intact, except for water, power and communications for the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis appear to be just playing at it," one woman said. "In the 
hospitals, for example, they've turned some sections into military areas for 
their soldiers. The rest of the hospitals are down to bare, skeleton staff." 
</P>
<P>
All the women talked about the resistance movement, which they said appears to 
be gaining strength. They said the sound of gunfire is heard every night, and 
that the Iraqis are carrying out door-to-door searches in much of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, asked if she thought the Iraqis were looking for foreigners to add 
to the "human shield" at key installations around the country, replied: "No. 
They've been looking for arms." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of resistance," said a woman who had lived in the Jahra district 
of the capital, a Bedouin area. She said a nighttime curfew had been imposed 
because of the growing number of sniper and firebomb incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"They're piling up bodies at hospitals every day," she said. "A lot of soldiers 
are getting killed. But in other areas there doesn't seem to be as much." 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent type of resistance attack, she said, is the "drive-by": The 
Kuwaitis open fire on an Iraqi soldier or two from a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
Such incidents are more often heard than seen, and even then only through a 
curtain crack or from a rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
"They're stuck in their flats," Byiers said of the Westerners still in Kuwait. 
"They keep the curtains closed, and they're not going out." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women said they had been given food and other basics by Kuwaiti 
neighbors, who would dart in, drop off the supplies and leave with a minimum of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
They said their only contact with the outside world was by radio and television 
from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. Food is running low in the shops, they 
said, but many Kuwaitis and foreigners have enough stockpiled to last for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Byiers said her husband can probably hold out for another month or two, if the 
Iraqi troops don't find him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've left him plenty of food, plenty of liquor, plenty of water and plenty of 
cigarettes," she said. "But he's nervous. He's decided that when the doorbell 
rings and the soldiers come for him, he'll just go quietly."

OIL COMPANIES EXPAND PLAN TO RESPOND TO MAJOR SPILLS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: FIRMS WILL SPEND $800 MILLION TO ESTABLISH FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS 
CAPABLE OF REACTING AROUND THE CLOCK TO DISASTERS IN U.S. COASTAL WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leading oil companies have agreed to spend $800 million -- more than three 
times their earlier estimate -- to staff and equip five around-the-clock teams 
capable of quickly responding to a major oil spill anywhere in U.S. coastal 
waters, industry sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The regional response centers, to be announced by oil industry executives today 
in Washington, D.C., are at Port Hueneme, Seattle, Lake Charles, La., the New 
York-New Jersey area and Port Everglades, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In California, satellite staging areas are planned in San Diego, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. The centers will be staffed by 64 full-time personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The response centers are expected to be operational within 2 1/2 years, and 
will augment existing cooperatives that are not equipped to deal with a major 
oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The chief executive officers of 14 major oil companies organized a task force 
after the disastrous March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez spill that dumped 11 million 
gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. The task force quickly 
concluded that the petroleum industry had "neither the equipment or the 
personnel" to handle a catastrophic tanker spill. 
</P>
<P>
"If oil is spilled close to a shoreline and if the drift of the oil caused by 
wind and current is onshore, it is unlikely that anyone can prevent shoreline 
contamination, no matter how ideal the conditions," the task force warned. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, two environmental groups completed a yearlong study that found 
that oil tanker traffic to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York harbors is 
so heavy -- at least 1,000 tanker visits to each port annually -- that a major 
oil spill was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
This study came weeks after the 394,000-gallon spill off Huntington Beach from 
the tanker Pacific Trader. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 petroleum companies had pledged to spend $250 million over five years to 
fund the "Petroleum Industry Response Organization" (PIRO). By comparison, 
Exxon spent more than $2 billion to clean up the Alaska spill. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will be renamed the Marine Spill Response Corporation and will 
be headed by retired Coast Guard Vice Adm. John D. Costello. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $60 million will be spent to set up the Port Hueneme response 
center. The Seattle center will cost $46 million, with staging areas planned 
for Astoria, Ore., Bellingham, Wash., Port Angeles, Wash., and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Each center, industry sources said, will be able to respond to a spill of 
216,000 barrels, or about 9 million gallons. If there is a larger spill, 
regional centers would join forces to respond, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the effort by the industry, critics have been skeptical that even a 
small spill can be satisfactorily cleaned up, not to speak of a Valdez-size 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Oil spill cleanup technology is considered fairly primitive, involving the 
skimming of surface waters, the use of chemical dispersants to break up the 
oil, or cleaning up beaches after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Skimmer boats lose their effectiveness in seas that are any higher than 2 1/2 
feet. While dispersants in use today are less toxic than earlier formulas, 
their use continues to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, major oil companies have been under pressure, both within and 
outside the industry, to improve their ability to respond to spills. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Exxon Valdez spill, the petroleum industry has paid a heavy political 
price. Congress has delayed any consideration of drilling in the Alaska 
National Wildlife Refuge. In California, the state Lands Commission has 
prohibited any new leases in state waters. 
</P>
<P>
Under Congressional pressure, President Bush was forced delay new oil leases 
off California.Last week, the California Legislature approved a bill by Sen. 
Barry Keene (D-Benicia) that would slap a 25-cent-a-barrel tax on oil companies 
to raise $100 million to establish an oil spill cleanup fund. Gov. George 
Deukmejian is expected to sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"After what happened in California, they realize every other coastal state may 
pursue similar legislation. I suspect they are trying to head off piecemeal 
approaches," California Energy Commission Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved legislation requiring that oil tankers be double hulled. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major oil companies participating in the regional response centers 
are ARCO, Unocal, Texaco, Sun, Shell, Phillips, Mobil, Exxon, Conoco, Chevron,

FOR FAMILY LEFT BEHIND, 'IT'S LIKE THEY CUT THE WORLD IN HALF'

"When they push the ship away from the pier, it's like they cut the world in 
half -- and they did. They cut my world in half," said Karen Powell, whose 
tears fell onto the 6-month-old baby in her arms as the destroyer-tender Acadia 
pulled out of the 32nd Street Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
The first San Diego-based vessel leaving from the West Coast to join Operation 
Desert Shield sailed Wednesday, marking a painful separation for the families 
watching the ship depart. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, a 30-year-old substitute teacher and mother of two, stood on Pier 7, 
waving to her husband, Norman, who clutched his binoculars and stood sandwiched 
between rows of sailors. As the 20,000-ton repair ship pulled away from shore, 
Powell held her infant above her head. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel so helpless," said Powell, whose husband has served 12 years in the 
Navy. "There's nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Acadia's 10 a.m. departure, the pier was crowded with couples 
clutching one another and children crying. When the lumbering ship began to 
draw away from the pier, a hush fell over the dock. One lone sailor ran toward 
the vessel, clutching his bag, with his wife, three small children and a 
supervising officer in tow. Too late to stop the ship, officers hurriedly 
summoned a tugboat, dubbed Mister Randy, to relay Petty Officer 1st Class 
Crescenio Corotan to the departing Acadia. 
</P>
<P>
Corotan, a laboratory technician, was not initially scheduled to join the ship 
on this deployment. But because his replacement never showed up, Corotan was 
informed Tuesday that he would have to ship out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy because he wasn't going. Now it's all this rush and he didn't 
have time to pack," said his wife, crying quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos erupted on the dock behind her. Husbands and wives yelled, some waved 
signs. As Barrie Leonard clutched her 6-month-old baby, her other son, Kenneth, 
6, bawled: "Daddy! Daddy! Don't leave me!" 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia will not be deployed to an area where heavy fighting is anticipated, 
since it is a repair vessel with little ability to defend itself. For the 
families gathered on the pier, this fact provided some consolation. 
</P>
<P>
While many were accustomed to routine six-month deployments, this departure was 
different and the possible dangers seemed very real. 
</P>
<P>
"I get this fear -- I am afraid I won't be seeing my husband anymore, that this 
is the last time I see anybody," said April Adamson, 19, a sailor whose husband 
stayed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson is one of 300 female crew members aboard the Acadia, which also has 900 
men. Though law prohibits women from participating in combat, they can serve 
out of the line of fire. Currently, 460 women are deployed aboard vessels 
participating in Operation Desert Shield. And so the pier was crowded with men 
as well as women, left behind to take care of the children. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be done," shrugged Chris Faith, a shipping clerk who bid goodby to 
his wife and walked hand-in- hand with his 7-year-old son and 4-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Six San Diego-based vessels are participating in Operation Desert Shield, but 
those ships were already in the region. The Acadia is the first to leave the 
city, sailing toward the Persian Gulf. Sending the Acadia, which could take 
several weeks to arrive, suggests that the United States is hunkering down for 
the long haul, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure signals that we intend to keep our destroyers in the Persian Gulf a 
long time," said retired Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, director of the Center 
for Defense Information in Washington. "The indication is clear that ships 
there intend to stay at least five months; otherwise they wouldn't need the 
services of a tender." 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia, commissioned in 1981, has been in the Persian Gulf before. The ship 
assisted the Navy frigate Stark that was hit by an Iraqi missile in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Acadia was originally expected to leave port in January. But because of 
escalating tension in the Mideast, that departure was moved up to September. 
And many families, though they learned of the schedule change a month ago, felt 
the crunch of preparing for a six-month departure with relatively short notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am still in shock," said Kaye Hunter, ombudsman for the ship, who 
clutched the hand of her husband, John, minutes before he boarded the vessel. 
But the Hunters' 13-year-old son was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to see my grandparents in New Mexico. This was going to be our 
second Christmas together -- everything is shot," said John William Hunter, 
gazing at his father. "Every time something good is happening, my dad is always 
leaving."

SINGLE CAUSE SUSPECTED FOR MANY WOES OF MAGELLAN; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: SCIENTISTS THINK THEY CAN WORK AROUND THE PROBLEM. THEY HOPE TO START 
MAPPING VENUS BY THE END OF THE MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who are trying to nurse the 
Magellan spacecraft back to good health believe both of the failures that hit 
the Venus orbiter last month may have resulted from a single cause rather than 
multiple problems. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it may not be necessary to fully understand the cause of the twin 
communications blackouts in order to work around the problem, said JPL 
scientist Stephen Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best news yet," Wall said in a briefing televised to space centers 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Since its last blackout on Aug. 21, Magellan had been operating on a small 
backup computer to lessen the chance of engineers losing control of the craft 
as it orbits Venus 153 million miles from Earth. On Saturday, the craft's main 
computer was switched on and has worked well since. 
</P>
<P>
"We carefully watched the spacecraft for eight hours," Wall said. "Everything 
went fine." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are studying data from that eight-hour period with the expectation 
that it will help them narrow the problem down to the "root cause," Wall added. 
</P>
<P>
That progress has encouraged scientists to put the craft through a series of 
maneuvers next week, and they hope to begin mapping the surface of Venus by the 
end of the month. On Tuesday, they will switch to a "medium gain antenna" used 
to transmit commands to the craft at a higher rate than is now possible. 
Wednesday they will try out the "high gain antenna," which will be used to 
transmit huge amounts of data from the craft to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, they will examine the results, plus data sent back before the 
problems occurred, "to see if it will tell us anything more about what happened 
during the first anomaly," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scientists continued to study the single strip of images that 
Magellan transmitted back to Earth before the problems began. The images are 
about 10 times sharper than photos from previous spacecraft, and they are 
giving scientists a tantalizing preview of what to expect during the two years 
that Magellan is to photograph nearly the entire surface of Earth's sister 
planet. The craft uses a radar camera that penetrates through the dense layer 
of Venusian clouds. 
</P>
<P>
So far, everything seen by the scientists supports long-held theories that the 
surface of Venus has been very active in the recent geological past. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of areas in which the surface is deformed, pulled apart or pushed 
together," much like the tectonic processes on Earth, said Jim Head of Brown 
University, a member of the Magellan science team. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the features appear to be quite young, geologically speaking, Head 
said. They seem to have been created by processes that have occurred within the 
last few tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years, "and maybe even 
today."

BRITAIN AGREES TO HELP FOOT THE BILL; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. AID FUND: THATCHER, AFTER MEETING WITH TREASURY SECRETARY BRADY, SAYS HER 
NATION 'WOULD CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE' TO THE GULF CAMPAIGN AND RELIEF EFFORT.

<P>
The Bush Administration's efforts to persuade major U.S. allies to help foot 
the bill for the Persian Gulf campaign against Iraq reaped its first modest 
results Wednesday as Britain agreed to contribute to a U.S. fund to aid Middle 
East countries hurt by the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, a spokeswoman for Thatcher said the prime 
minister had declared that Britain "would certainly contribute" and would 
announce the amount as soon as it could. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials also said that French officials had told them earlier that they 
would bring up the U.S. request for funds at a meeting of top officials of the 
12-nation European Community on Friday. They said the EC also is expected to 
react favorably to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as Brady, accompanied by a delegation of high-level 
Treasury officials, left Britain and flew to Anchorage, Alaska, en route to 
appointments Friday with leaders of South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush ordered Brady and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to 
approach America's major allies for financial help, both in underwriting the 
U.S. deployment and in helping Middle East countries that were hurt by the 
economic squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
Baker left Washington late Wednesday evening for trips to Saudi Arabia and 
Egypt before meeting Bush at Helsinki, Finland, for the superpower summit with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday. He later will visit Moscow, 
Rome and Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Treasury officials clarified figures given to reporters on Tuesday 
on what the Administration wants the allies to pay for the U.S. military 
buildup in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official defined those costs as those that go beyond what it 
ordinarily would cost to maintain those same American forces at their home 
bases in the United States. They estimate that these would total $6 billion 
this year and $12 billion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate that the Treasury provided Tuesday said the United States was 
seeking $15 billion by the end of 1990. The Treasury officials also said then 
that Washington was seeking $10 billion to aid other hard-hit gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official said Wednesday that Washington will continue to seek 
help for gulf states, other than Iraq, that had been hurt by the global 
economic embargo imposed against Baghdad and will ask the allies to pay all the 
costs of deploying U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick up all of it," the 
senior official said. "After all, they couldn't buy this (military) capability 
anywhere else in the world, and we have paid for it" with America's investment 
in a strong military. 
</P>
<P>
"We Americans have a right to expect the (financial) burden to be shared more 
appropriately," added another senior official. "This is an exercise in which 
the whole industrialized world is going to benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Top Administration officials indicated that such comprehensive allied financial 
support could thus ease the budget pressures that are building on the federal 
government as a result of the massive deployment of American troops in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
They said if the allies do agree to pick up the entire military bill, the 
Pentagon will be better able to forecast its spending needs for the next year. 
"This burden-sharing will have an impact on the budget," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday said Washington believes 
that the gulf states that have been hurt by the embargo against Iraq -- 
primarily Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- will need a minimum of $3.5 billion in 
aid this year and $7 billion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
They said the United States is pushing other nations -- notably France -- to 
forgive the military debts owed to them by Egypt, as a sign of support for 
Egypt's decision to oppose Iraq. Bush already has agreed to write off about 
$7.1 billion in debt for arms shipments to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials also provided the first detailed list of nations that they plan 
to ask for financial assistance either for the military buildup or for the 
so-callled front-line states. 
</P>
<P>
Besides France, Britain, South Korea and Japan, that list includes Taiwan, 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, West Germany, Italy and the European 
Community as a group. They also will ask the exiled former government of Kuwait 
to contribute. Kuwait still has large sums in banks. 
</P>
<P>
Because both Britain and France have committed naval forces in the Persian 
Gulf, Brady did not ask them to help in paying for America's military buildup. 
Instead, he said, he sought -- and won -- their cooperation in providing 
financial assistance for the other gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
But senior Administration officials traveling with Brady said they do expect 
big financial commitments to cover the military costs from both South Korea and 
Japan, two of America's most successful economic competitors. Both are heavily 
dependent on oil from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Brady plans to meet with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo in Seoul on Friday 
morning and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu later in the day in Tokyo 
before returning to Washington early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, the richest of the nations on Brady's itinerary, last week became the 
first ally to make a specific pledge of financial assistance, when it said it 
would provide at least $1 billion in aid in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Still, senior American officials indicated they think Japan should provide more 
help than that. 
</P>
<P>
One official said that the $1-billion figure only represented "a good start" on 
Japan's part. "We are in a changing world. . . . We have been talking about 
burden-sharing with Japan and with Europe for a long time," one official said.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz met with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev on Wednesday amid suggestions that Baghdad wants Moscow to mediate 
the crisis in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet Union appeared increasingly angered by Iraq's refusal to obey 
the U.N. Security Council's call for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Aziz's discussion of the situation with Gorbachev was described as frank by the 
official Soviet news agency Tass, which had earlier reported Moscow's acute 
frustration that its diplomacy and that of other countries had failed to bring 
about an Iraqi withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tass provided no details of Aziz's meeting with Gorbachev, the Iraqi 
ambassador to Moscow, Ghafil Jassim Hussein, told the newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda that Baghdad hopes the Soviet Union can help mediate the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"We have common viewpoints directed at the peaceful solution of the conflict," 
the ambassador said. "We still hope that the Soviet Union will be able to 
perform the role of peacemaker and remain the loyal friend of the Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
Noting the Soviet commitment to resolve the crisis through political rather 
than military means, Tass quoted senior Foreign Ministry officials as 
emphasizing, before the Aziz-Gorbachev meeting, Moscow's desire "for the 
moment, at least, to maintain permanent diplomatic contact with Iraqi leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, these contacts, including a visit to Moscow in mid-August by Iraq's 
deputy prime minister, Saddoun Hamadi, have not produced "the desired result -- 
the immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the restoration of 
that country's independence and sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
Aziz was sent to Moscow by President Saddam Hussein in advance of the meeting 
this weekend in Helsinki of Gorbachev and President Bush, who will discuss the 
Persian Gulf crisis and other international issues. Aziz will address a press 
conference here today. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is the best pipeline to Bush that Saddam Hussein could have," a 
senior European diplomat commented. "He not only is authoritative as a 
messenger, but his comments as the leader of the other superpower will have to 
be listened to and weighed carefully. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the Iraqis are misjudging Gorbachev if they expect his sympathy, 
let alone his support. This is a crisis that the Soviet Union wants no more 
than the West, for it destroys the 'peaceful international environment,' as 
they put it, for their domestic reforms." 
</P>
<P>
A commentator in the government newspaper Izvestia, Leonid Koryavin, said 
Wednesday that Hussein, misjudging the fundamental changes in international 
relations, had probably expected to force a split between the Soviet Union, 
long an ally, and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Had all this happened several years ago, we certainly would have taken a 
different stand," Koryavin said. "Baghdad apparently assumed that we would 
declare as aggression not its attack on Kuwait but the landing of U.S. troops 
in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis, in fact, has strengthened trust between the two superpowers, 
Koryavin continued, noting that neither Moscow nor Washington tried to take 
advantage of it and that both were cooperating to find a peaceful solution 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials said earlier that Gorbachev will press Bush in Helsinki to 
undertake new efforts through the United Nations to secure Iraq's withdrawal 
from Kuwait and will renew Moscow's longstanding proposal for a Middle East 
peace conference that could address all the problems of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a congressional delegation led by the Senate minority leader, Bob 
Dole of Kansas, Gorbachev said he will report on his discussions with Aziz, but 
he reaffirmed the Soviet commitment to ensuring the Iraqi withdrawal from 
Kuwait through U.N. sanctions and other political means.

A ship carrying 800 Japanese four-wheel-drive vehicles for the U.S.-led 
multinational force, delayed for a day until the Japanese government agreed to 
guarantee the crew's safety, sailed for the Persian Gulf today, the shipping 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
The $11 million in cargo, Japan's first installment of the $1 billion it has 
promised in aid for the effort against Iraq, also included an unspecified 
number of water trucks and air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Departure of the Sea Venus from the port of Nagoya was delayed when the 
All-Japan Seamen's Union insisted that the government guarantee the safety of 
the Panamanian-registered car carrier's 16 Filipino and four Japanese crew 
members. The union said its members should not be forced to sail into the tense 
gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian-registered ship, owned by Kawasaki Kisen Co. Ltd., will take 
about three weeks to get to the area, the ship's agent said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles are expected to be used by military staffs in the multinational 
forces assembled in Saudi Arabia, according to a Foreign Ministry official.

<TEXT>
<P>
At this weekend's summit in Helsinki, President Bush will offer to arrange 
international financial aid for the Soviet Union if Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev agrees to withdraw advisers from Iraq and possibly send troops to the 
region, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared that the international trade embargo 
could kill Iraqi children and urged Arabs to overthrow the leaders of Saudi 
Arabia and Egypt for backing the international effort to expel his forces from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III departed for the Persian Gulf, the Soviet 
Union and Europe to encourage international support for the campaign against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said it will help finance the cost of the Middle East campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
An independent analyst predicted that the United States and Saudi Arabia would 
prevail in a military offensive against Iraq but would lose five to six armored 
divisions, which some government analysts said implied casualties of 32,000 to 
48,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
The United States moved missiles and troops closer to Saudi Arabia's border 
with Kuwait in nighttime operations and airlifts. Meanwhile, an estimated 2,000 
Egyptian special forces troops and Kuwaitis were deployed at the front below 
the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of goods are reaching Iraq by air despite the international trade

GULF CRISIS COULD PUSH U.S. DEFICIT TO RECORD; 
</P>

ECONOMICS: MILITARY EXPENSES AND HIGHER OIL PRICES COULD ADD $18 BILLION TO THE 
DEBT, BUDGET DIRECTOR SAYS.

Military expenses and oil-price boosts associated with the Persian Gulf crisis 
could push next year's federal budget deficit to a record $250 billion -- $18 
billion more than the last official estimate, White House Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Darman's unofficial projection, Republicans and Democrats who emerged 
from separate budget strategy sessions said they are sticking to the so-called 
50-500 plan -- a goal of lopping $50 billion off the fiscal 1991 deficit and 
$500 billion off cumulative deficits over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd ask a guess of what the . . . (deficit) tendency is at the moment, I 
would say it's probably closer to $250 billion" than the last official estimate 
of $232 billion, Darman told reporters. The highest federal deficit ever 
recorded was $221 billion in fiscal 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Before Darman's remarks, some in Congress had suggested that both parties might 
lower their sights and seek smaller cuts in the deficit because of increased 
military costs resulting from the deployment of troops in Saudi Arabia 
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
However, both House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and White House 
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, who met with House Republicans along with 
Darman, said they remain committed to the "50-500" plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been at '50-500,' and that's where we remain," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gephardt nor House Republicans would disclose details of the 
deficit-reducing plans that they discussed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional budget negotiators Friday will begin a new round of 
deficit-reduction talks, sequestered at Andrews Air Force Base in nearby 
Maryland. The negotiators are facing a self-imposed deadline of Sept. 10 to 
reach an agreement on deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Congress must agree on a debt-reduction package by Oct. 1 to forestall 
across-the-board budget cuts of $100 billion that would be imposed 
automatically under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Gramm-Rudman law would require Congress to trim the deficit by $64 
billion to avoid the automatic cuts, there is widespread expectation that the 
target will be lowered as part of any deficit-reduction pact. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Sununu said they hope the 
negotiators can reach a budget accord before President Bush addresses a joint 
session of Congress next Tuesday, following his weekend summit meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Although the direct costs of the military buildup in the Persian Gulf are 
significant, Darman told reporters that "the potentially more significant costs 
are if the economy slows" in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"If the effect of the oil prices and if the psychological uncertainty . . . 
slows (economic) growth to, let's say, the 0% to 1% range, then that would 
translate into a $250 billion base-line deficit," Darman said. That figure 
includes next year's share of the cost of the bailout of the troubled savings 
and loan industry, he said.

HUSSEIN'S BUZZWORDS TAP INTO ARAB SENSE OF INJUSTICE; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: HIS CALL FOR A JIHAD AGAINST THE WEST EVOKES DEEP FEELINGS. BUT THE 
SOCIALIST, SECULAR IRAQI IS THE WRONG MAN TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE.

President Saddam Hussein of Iraq evoked one of the most emotionally loaded of 
Middle East buzzwords Wednesday when he called on fellow Arabs to wage a jihad, 
or holy war, against the multinational force in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
To many Westerners, the word jihad conjures up images of swirling crowds in the 
streets of Tehran chanting "God is great!" and "Death to America!" It brings on 
nightmares of hijackings and airport massacres and Iranian boys going to do 
battle against the Iraqis with wooden keys to heaven hanging from their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The word has no less an emotional impact on the Arab masses. It speaks of Arabs 
standing together to fight outsiders, of Islam's strength in uniting true 
believers, of all the injustices the Arabs believe they suffered during 2,000 
years of foreign rule at the hands of the Greeks, Romans, Ottoman Turks and 
European colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hussein's call for jihad is not likely to have any real impact, many 
Arabs still find the notion worth cheering. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Hussein has relied on slogans in the hope of acquiring support 
for his invasion of Kuwait, a move that has been condemned even by Arab 
countries that had been his allies. He has offered to withdraw, but only if 
Israel withdraws from its own occupied territories. He has said he is trying to 
redistribute the Arab world's wealth among the poorer nations. And at least 
twice he has called for a holy war against the infidels. 
</P>
<P>
"We call upon all Arabs, within the teachings of Allah and according to the 
Muslim holy war of jihad," Hussein said Wednesday, according to his 
government's English translation of the speech, "to fight this U.S. presence of 
nonbelievers and to fight the stance taken by Arab agents who have followed 
these foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
His slogans are compelling to those who still believe in such a thing as an 
"Arab nation." How, after all, could an Arab argue against freeing Palestine, 
driving out the foreigners and safeguarding the holy places of Islam? 
</P>
<P>
But Hussein is the wrong man to deliver the message, and his attempt to 
capitalize on the growing religious fervor in the Middle East will strike some 
as less than creditable. 
</P>
<P>
First, Hussein, a Sunni Muslim ruling a Shiite Muslim majority, runs a secular, 
socialistic country. He has bought peace with the mullahs, or holy men, by 
building mosques for them, but he does not permit them to meddle in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it was Hussein who in 1980 went to war with the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's Iran, a country with a rigid interpretation of Islam and its holy 
book, the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
What Hussein has done with his buzzwords is what many other Arab leaders have 
done: manipulate religion for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
When, for example, Egypt's Anwar Sadat needed support after negotiating an 
unpopular peace treaty with Israel, he called in loyalist sheiks and asked for 
a favorable religious ruling. They said there was nothing unholy about the 
alliance because the Prophet Mohammed himself had once struck an agreement with 
the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In this century, religious fervor as a factor in Middle East politics is a 
relatively new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arabs' 1967 war against Israel, the battle cry was "land, sea and air," 
reflecting a faith in modern equipment and technology. But they were defeated 
in six days, and many Arabs believe they lost because they had not been pious 
enough and had angered God. The mosques started filling up, and women started 
putting back on the veils that their mothers had discarded as symbols of sexual 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
By 1973, with fundamentalism taking hold in the region, the Arabs went to war 
with Israel again, and this time the war was carried out under the banner of 
Islam. The Arab offensive was code-named "Badr," after Mohammed's first victory 
in AD 623, and on the battlefields the cry "Allahu akbar!" (God is great) was 
raised by a people who believed they were fighting for a holy cause. 
</P>
<P>
To the true believer, Islam is as much a way of life as it is a religion. It 
demands five obligations, or pillars, of its followers: accepting one God and 
Mohammed as his prophet, praying five times a day, giving a specified amount of 
one's income to the needy, fasting from dawn to dusk during the holy month of 
Ramadan, and making the hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca at least once in one's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a sixth obligation is included: the jihad. In the West, the word is 
generally translated as "holy war," although its real definition is much wider. 
In Arabic it means, literally, "utmost effort," or to protect and strive for 
Islam. Some Muslims say an internal spiritual struggle can also be called a 
jihad. 
</P>
<P>
In one of its meanings, it could include armed conflict, but it does not 
connote irrational militancy. Nor, in its proper context, is jihad used to mean 
waging war for political or personal ends, as some argue that Saddam Hussein 
has used the word.

HYDROGEN LEAK DELAYS COLUMBIA LIFTOFF; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: IT'S THE THIRD TIME SINCE MAY THAT SUCH A PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED. 
OFFICIALS SAY A LAUNCHING IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IS POSSIBLE BUT NOT 
'REALISTIC.'

<P>
For the snake-bitten officials of NASA, the third time was not the charm. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time since May, NASA engineers attempted to load liquid hydrogen 
fuel into a shuttle's fuel tanks. And, for the third time, technicians 
discovered a hydrogen leak, forcing them to scrub the oft-delayed launching of 
the shuttle Columbia and the star-crossed Astro observatory. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:38 p.m. PDT, less than an hour after fuel loading had begun and less than 
eight hours before Columbia's scheduled launching at 10:20 p.m., launch 
director Robert Sieck decided that levels of potentially explosive hydrogen gas 
in the aft compartment of Columbia were too high for safety and ordered the 
launching aborted for the second time within a week. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the mission was scrubbed, the level of hydrogen in the compartment 
was about 6,000 parts per million, about 10 times higher than the maximum level 
permissible for a launching. 
</P>
<P>
By late evening Wednesday, engineers still had not identified the source of the 
leak, but space shuttle director Robert L. Crippen said it would be at least 
three or four days before another attempt at launching could be made. "But I 
don't believe that's realistic," he added, indicating that such an attempt may 
be much further in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said also that because of the leak he would probably order a fueling 
test of the shuttle Discovery, which is now on pad 39B awaiting its Oct. 5 
launching with the Ulysses probe, which is to slingshot past Jupiter to go into 
a polar orbit around the sun. NASA has only an 18-day window in October during 
which to launch Ulysses. If it is not launched then, the agency must wait an 
additional 13 months before the planets are in the proper alignment once more. 
</P>
<P>
Such a test would add at least five days to Discovery's already tight 
prelaunching schedule, placing the flight in jeopardy. NASA officials had 
previously been worried by a loss of Freon coolant in Discovery, and the need 
for a test will further compound their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was originally scheduled for launching on May 29, but officials 
scrubbed the liftoff when potentially explosive hydrogen gas was detected 
outside the shuttle and in its aft compartment. Officials ordered a test 
fueling of the shuttle Atlantis in July and found that it also was leaking. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of that leak caused NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly to ground the 
shuttle fleet until the cause of the leaks could be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the 17-inch valve removed from Columbia after the first leak 
indicated it had been contaminated with submicroscopic glass beads that had 
prevented gaskets in the valve from making a tight seal. Although technicians 
have not yet disassembled the valve from Atlantis, it was from the same batch 
as the Columbia valve and Crippen had said earlier Wednesday that it most 
likely was also contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
The newly installed 17-inch valve on Columbia was from a different batch and 
had shown a much lower leak rate during preliminary testing. Crippen said NASA 
was "very confident" that the leak problem had been solved. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were so confidant, in fact, that they canceled a fueling test of 
Columbia because it would have added five days to their already tight schedule. 
That was a gamble that now appears not to have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen noted Wednesday evening that engineers had run leak tests in Columbia's 
aft compartment after the aborted May launching and had not found any leaks. 
Because of that, they assumed that the excess hydrogen in the aft compartment 
was a result of the leak on the 17-inch valve. That assumption, he conceded, 
was apparently wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Because engineers have already unsuccessfully searched for a leak in the aft 
compartment, the probability of finding it quickly now seems small, he 
admitted. "That's going to be tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's failure to find the leak in the previous tests, as well as 
Crippen's decision not to run a fueling test on Columbia, is certain to bring 
fresh criticism to an agency that is already shell-shocked. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the summer-long grounding of the shuttle fleet, NASA suffered 
acute embarrassment from the discovery that the mirror on its showpiece Hubble 
Space Telescope has an imperfection that will greatly reduce the orbiting 
observatory's scientific usefulness until it can be repaired by a shuttle 
mission in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have twice lost 
contact with the Magellan space probe, which is orbiting Venus.

Bonn and Moscow have hit a number of snags in the rush to clear up their 
complicated relations before Germany unites next month, diplomats said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in East Berlin said that six-nation talks on the international 
aspects of unification had run into difficulty over the withdrawal of the 
nearly 370,000 Soviet troops from East Germany over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of East and West Germany and the four World War II allies -- the 
United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France -- are drafting an accord to be 
signed by their foreign ministers at so-called "two-plus-four" talks in Moscow 
next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats could not say what the precise areas of disagreement were, but they 
speculated that Moscow might be delaying matters until Bonn indicates how 
generous it will be in helping to pay for the troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The Berliner Morgenpost, a West German newspaper, reported Wednesday that Bonn 
has agreed to pay half the cost of withdrawing the Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement apparently was reached in advance of a meeting taking place in 
Bonn between West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Soviet Deputy Prime 
Minister Stephan A. Sitaryan. Officials in Bonn said the talks, which began 
Wednesday, might continue for several days. 
</P>
<P>
East and West Germany are to unite on Oct. 3.

EIGHT PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO MURDER IN N.Y. SUBWAY

Eight young men said to belong to a gang whose members must commit a mugging to 
be admitted were arraigned Wednesday on murder charges in the slaying of a Utah 
tourist who was stabbed during a robbery in a subway station. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the men pleaded not guilty and all were remanded to jail without bail 
by state Supreme Court Justice Judith Levitt. They were scheduled to appear in 
court Friday to hear the conclusions of a grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The eight suspects, ages 17 to 20, were charged with murder, robbery and 
assault in the death of Brian Watkins, 22, a tennis buff from Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, visiting New York with his family to attend the U.S. Open, was slain 
Sunday night while trying to defend his mother and father against a gang of 
muggers in the Manhattan subway station. 
</P>
<P>
All eight suspects in the Watkins slaying were said to be part of the 
Queens-based FTS gang, a graffiti crew whose members are required to mug 
someone in order to join, according to a report in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were unaware of the FTS gang, even though the group's name can 
be seen scrawled on the walls of subway stations and other buildings in the 
Flushing neighborhood of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not come to the attention of the Police Department as a group that 
has committed an illegal act," said John Galea, a retired sergeant and former 
head of a police gang intelligence unit. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents and friends of the suspects told the newspaper that Yull 
Morales, 19, who police believe did the stabbing, was the founder of the FTS 
gang and the one who imposed the mugging initiation rule. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak several years ago, FTS had a membership of about 250 youths who 
pursued dancing and spray-painting graffiti as hobbies, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives have said they believe the suspects took $200 from Watkins' father 
to pay for a party at Roseland, a popular dance hall near the subway stop.

The small Havasupai Indian tribe, which makes its home at the bottom of the 
Grand Canyon, was struggling to save its remote village Wednesday after a 
rainstorm sent a 12-foot wall of water through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The flood, which hit late Monday, destroyed two homes, damaged a dozen others 
and killed an undetermined number of horses, the only means of transportation 
for food, goods and mail, Bureau of Indian Affairs officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, but 60 tourists were flown out by helicopter Tuesday 
and 107 elderly Havasupai were flown to the Hualapai Indian Reservation 80 
miles away on the south rim of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to people who've lived there all their lives, and they say this is 
the worst they've seen it," said George Keller, Bureau of Indian Affairs 
superintendent at Valentine, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Supai, the Havasupai people's only village, is considered the most remote 
Indian town in the continental United States. The only way in and out is an 
eight-mile-long pack horse trail or by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The village is 69 winding Colorado River miles west of the Phantom Ranch, a 
popular tourist stop below the South Rim, and 12 miles into Havasu Canyon, 
south of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Supai, home to about 800 Havasupai Indians, is considered one of the more 
picturesque spots in Arizona, with its world-renowned blue-green water flowing 
over three waterfalls hundreds of feet high and all contained within the depths 
of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said more rain was expected, raising concerns that three nearby dams on 
the plateau above could overflow and send more water cascading into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Coconino Country Board of Supervisors declared the flood site a 
disaster area, opening the way to call in Arizona National Guard helicopters.

OIL CRISIS' TIMING COULDN'T BE WORSE FOR EASTERN EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: RISING CRUDE PRICES DEAL A SEVERE SETBACK TO THE NATIONS' MOVES TOWARD 
MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIES. THREE OF THE COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY ASKED THE U.N.

<P>
Czechoslovakian Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus didn't need any more grief, but 
he got it when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Middle East crisis, Klaus, a former dissident economist, was 
already the butt of jokes in Prague for his sweeping new moves to impose 
discipline on the Czechoslovakian economy during its shift from Communism to a 
market-oriented system. 
</P>
<P>
Many Czechs were blaming Klaus, rather than his Communist predecessors, for the 
rapid deterioration in their living standard. 
</P>
<P>
Then the oil shock hit just as Klaus was trying to prepare the country for his 
most unpopular plan of all: a program aimed at lifting controls on prices and 
ending many government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"This oil crisis has come at the worst possible moment for us," Klaus said in 
an interview at an economic seminar in Wyoming late last week. "Now, we (the 
reform government) will be blamed for this." 
</P>
<P>
Klaus is hardly the only East European economic official to despair over the 
Middle East crisis and the resulting oil price shock. 
</P>
<P>
Already, three Eastern European countries -- Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania 
-- have filed documents with the United Nations declaring that their economies 
are starting to suffer as a result of the crisis and the worldwide oil and 
trade embargoes imposed on Iraq and Kuwait. They have asked the international 
community for relief. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the surge in oil prices has come just when Eastern Europe's economic 
reformation may be at its most vulnerable point -- when many of the countries 
in the region are facing both recession and inflation resulting from their 
efforts to rapidly embrace free-market economics. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the oil shock is bound to intensify Eastern Europe's pain. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is aggravated still more, because the (oil shock) coincides with 
a deepening economic crisis in our country, coupled with a course of thorough 
economic and political transformations," the Bulgarian government wrote in its 
plea to the United Nations for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I can definitely say that next to the victim of the aggression, Kuwait . . . 
Bulgaria is the most affected country," a senior Bulgarian official said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil price pressures on the region have been complicated by the fact that 
the Soviet Union, which traditionally has provided the Eastern Europeans with 
subsidized oil, has already announced that it will begin charging them world 
prices -- and demanding payment in hard currency instead of bartered goods. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the world prices themselves have been pushed higher, making the transition 
all the more precarious. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger of a serious recession in Eastern Europe has been increased by the 
oil shock," said John Williamson, an economist at the Institute for 
International Economics, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also a danger that the people will see this external shock as the 
fault of the reform movements in their countries," Williamson said. "It 
obviously makes life much more difficult for Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The earlier willingness of the Soviet Union to accept barter deals in return 
for oil effectively meant that the Soviets were subsidizing their satellites 
with cheap energy, partly to keep them in line politically. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts say that earlier this year the Eastern European nations were 
paying the equivalent of $12 a barrel in the barter goods that they shipped to 
the Soviets -- at a time when world oil prices were at $18 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Moscow's old trading system with Eastern Europe is breaking down, 
however, the Soviet shift in policy represents "a double whammy for Eastern 
Europe," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. 
</P>
<P>
To top that off, the region's emerging democracies have also been hurt by the 
worldwide embargo on trade with Iraq, which had been a significant source of 
crude oil for the entire area. One oil refinery in Romania has already been 
forced to shut down because its crude oil supplies from Iraq have been cut off, 
Foreign Ministry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, the Eastern European countries paid for their Iraqi oil by shipping 
weapons and other manufactured products to Baghdad. But with the embargo in 
effect, their long-term contracts have been frozen, leaving them with massive 
bills left unpaid by the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Romania, for instance, said the trade sanctions have jeopardized the repayment 
of $1.7 billion in debts it is owed by Iraq, while Bulgaria said it still is 
out $1.2 billion, which it had hoped would be repaid with Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, declining investment in the region's own oil industry -- 
particularly in Romania, the largest oil producer in Eastern Europe -- has 
resulted in a steep plunge in oil production within the former Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern European oil production declined from 359,000 barrels a day in 1985 to 
just 301,000 barrels a day in 1989 -- making the region all the more vulnerable 
to price hikes for imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Western economists estimate that the surge in oil prices will cost 
each Eastern European nation between $1 billion and $2 billion during the next 
year. By contrast, the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, should 
reap a $10-billion windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Those added energy costs will come just as inflation is mounting in much of 
Eastern Europe as a result of the lifting of price controls on a wide range of 
consumer goods. Much of the region's plethora of shortages had stemmed from the 
fact that prices had been kept so low. 
</P>
<P>
At the onset, such reform packages tend to be highly controversial, since they 
allow prices to surge at a time when wages are being held down by the 
anti-inflation policies of the central government. 
</P>
<P>
As Klaus is finding in Czechoslovakia, the oil shock thus makes it harder to 
sell economic reform to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Hormats, who consults for Western corporations studying investments in the 
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, pointed out that almost all of the Eastern 
European nations, with the possible exception of Hungary, are already in 
recession and will need more assistance from the West as a result of the oil 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that Western companies will become more wary of investing 
there as higher oil prices push up the trade deficits and inflation rates of 
the nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of the Paris office of Cambridge Energy 
Research, an energy consulting firm, agreed. "This makes a difficult situation 
all the more difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, few analysts believe that Eastern Europe's economic reforms will be 
permanently sidetracked by higher oil prices -- if only because the urge for 
Western-style standards of living is too strong.

JAPANESE DEVELOPER TO BUY ALL OF PEBBLE BEACH CO.; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE CONTROVERSIAL GOLF COURSE MAGNATE ORIGINALLY WANTED A 49% 
STAKE IN THE RESORT FIRM. THE TOTAL PRICE MAY TOP $800 MILLION.

<P>
A firm controlled by controversial Japanese developer Minoru Isutani has agreed 
to buy Pebble Beach Co., which owns some of the most prestigious golf courses 
in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Hogan Properties of Ft. Worth, owned by Isutani's Cosmo World Co., 
initially had agreed to purchase a 49% stake in Pebble Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
But in a brief announcement released late Wednesday, Pebble Beach officials 
said Ben Hogan Properties had purchased the entire company. The 49% share was 
previously valued at up to $400 million, suggesting the total price may 
approach or exceed $800 million. Ben Hogan Properties was acquired by privately 
held Cosmo World in 1988 for $52 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale thus adds Pebble Beach to a growing list of U.S. trophy resort 
properties acquired in recent years by the Japanese, whose interest in golf has 
grown phenomenally. Another Japanese investment firm recently purchased the 
Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Pebble Beach Co., based in Pebble Beach on the Monterey Peninsula, is currently 
owned by a real estate partnership known as Miller, Klutznick, Davis &amp; 
Gray. Los Angeles business tycoon Marvin Davis is the best-known partner. 
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about this new alliance," Pebble Beach Co. President Tom Oliver 
said in a statement. "Our combined decades of experience will assure that 
Pebble Beach will remain among the world's finest golfing resorts." 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman who identified herself as a consultant to Pebble Beach 
Co. offered no explanation for the Japanese firm's decision to purchase the 
entire company. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no changes in personnel or management anticipated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Solter, a spokesman for Davis, also could not explain the change in the 
deal. "I know nothing about it," Solter said, adding that he didn't have "the 
slightest idea" why Isutani decided to purchase the entire Pebble Beach Co. 
rather than the 49% previously discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no surprises any more," said Solter, declining to elaborate on the 
specifics of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Pebble Beach owns four golf courses, two resort hotels and hundreds of acres of 
undeveloped property on the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmo World's fiercely private principal, Isutani, recently made headlines in 
Japan and the United States. The Japanese press has been covering his 
relationship with former NTT Corp. Chairman Hisashi Shinto, who is being tried 
for political bribery in a stock scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Las Vegas Sun newspaper reported that Isutani's application for 
a Nevada gaming license may be rejected because of his association with Shinto. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Cosmo-owned country clubs in Japan have also complained that the 
company has oversold memberships and has reneged on pledges to allow members to 
resell their memberships. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Honda, executive vice president of Cosmo World in Los Angeles, could not be 
reached for comment late Wednesday. However in a previous interview, he called 
the allegations against Isutani "a cheap shot and erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
Isutani serves as president of six companies. They include Cosmo World Co., 
which produces software in Japan; Olympic Staff Co., which makes sporting 
equipment, and four land development firms. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani is also planning to build the Los Angeles International Golf Course in 
the Tujunga Wash area of the San Fernando Valley. Homeowners in the area have 
questioned the environmental impact of the course, although the local chamber 
of commerce supports the project.

IBM UNVEILS ITS NEW GENERATION OF MAINFRAMES; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH TECH: ANALYSTS SAID THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE BIG BLUE 
HAS MADE IN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.

<P>
In what was termed its most important announcement in 25 years, International 
Business Machines on Wednesday unveiled its new generation of mainframe 
computers, machines the company said will set its tone in this all-important 
market for the rest of the century. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the company announced 140 new products, including 18 new computers, 
that on average will double the computing power of the current models, which 
are used to handle such complex tasks as automated banking transactions, 
airline reservations, insurance policy tracking and inventory controls. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising many analysts, the company said 11 of the 18 new computers are 
immediately available and that all but three will be available within nine 
months. However, many other remaining products, including a wide range of IBM 
software that will give the machines their additional power and speed, won't be 
available until mid- or late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Still, IBM's announcement, coming a day after rival Japanese mainframe maker 
Fujitsu unveiled a competing model, was generally viewed as among IBM's most 
aggressive moves in a year marked by uncharacteristically bold IBM product 
launches. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM's objective is to regenerate mainframe demand and I believe they can 
achieve this," said Bob Djurdjevic, a Phoenix technology analyst. "I think they 
are uncorking mainframe demand." 
</P>
<P>
Although the new generation of mainframes had been dubbed "Summit" by financial 
analysts and computer industry observers during its seven-year-long 
development, IBM officials said the new family never had that code name and is 
known only as system 390 at Big Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," laughed George Conrades, IBM's senior vice president for 
marketing services when asked about Summit at Wednesday's press conference 
here. "This is what we have all been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some early praise for IBM's moves, analysts remained divided over 
whether the company can achieve one of its key objectives for its new mainframe 
family: quickly reversing its sagging performance of the last few years. 
Several Wall Street analysts had been predicting a rocky transition and 
possibly sagging profits for the company as it attempts this sweeping product 
launch, its most ambitious since it introduced its first mainframe 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike its previous product rollouts, this year IBM faces a weak U.S. economy 
and softening demand even in Europe, which has been a strong source of sales, 
noted Ulrich Weil, a Washington analyst. Further, competition is intensifying 
from such Japanese rivals as Fujitsu and Hitachi. 
</P>
<P>
Mainframes are big business for IBM, accounting for more than 50% of its $62.7 
billion in sales last year and perhaps as much as 60% of its $3.7 billion in 
profit. But IBM's share of the market is slipping, from 95% of U.S. sales in 
1987 to 87% this year, according to estimates from Computer Intelligence, a San 
Jose market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Further, there are increasing signs that growth of the overall mainframe market 
is slowing as smaller systems become more powerful and take over tasks once 
reserved for the giant machines. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has made it clear that it wants to disprove the conventional wisdom that 
huge mainframe computers -- often disparagingly referred to as dinosaurs -- are 
things of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe strongly in the future of large systems," said Carl J. Conti, 
general manager of IBM's Enterprise Systems Unit. "The role of these large 
systems is continuing to expand." IBM executives said the new systems contain a 
variety of new technology and design approaches. Among the more notable 
advances they cited are: 
</P>
<P>
* New software to connect IBM mainframe to a wider variety of computers from 
other manufacturers; 
</P>
<P>
* High-speed fiber optic lines that can connect machines up to 5.6 miles away, 
without any loss of power or speed; 
</P>
<P>
* Increased use of so-called parallel processing designs that will allow 
customers to string together as many as eight separate mainframe systems, each 
with six individual information processing units, to create a 48-processor 
system; 
</P>
<P>
* An attention to security concerns with a new cryptographic system to include 
sensitive data being sent over networks, a development said already to have 
aroused the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives said 50 of the new systems will be delivered before the end 
of the month and by next year the system 390 will account for more than 50% of 
IBM's mainframe sales. 
</P>
<P>
Again executives said sales throughout this year and into next will be aided by 
aggressive incentives to customers, including generous trade-in allowances on 
their existing IBM mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
Early comparisons to Fujitsu's new mainframe are difficult, analysts said, 
because little is known about the Japanese maker's system. However, Djurdjevic, 
who has tested the Fujitsu machine, said it appears to have faster processors, 
capable of handling about 50 million instructions per second, a common 
measurement of computer speed. IBM's new models can handle about 41 million 
instructions per second, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless Djurdjevic said that by other measurements, including software, 
ability to connect a variety of machines and other features, the IBM systems 
are superior.

Pineapple Era Ending in Lanai: Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said it will phase out 
commercial production of pineapple on the island of Lanai because it no longer 
pays to grow, handle, and ship pineapple in Hawaii. Castle &amp; Cooke, based 
in Los Angeles, owns 98% of Lanai and is the parent of Dole Foods Inc. The 
phase-out should be complete by 1993. Castle &amp; Cooke stock jumped $2.625 to 
close at $35.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Charles H. Keating Jr., a key 
figure in the savings and loan crisis, had agreed to live by limitations a 
federal judge had temporarily imposed on his finances. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Keating has to give the federal Office of Thrift 
Supervision 48 hours notice of any transactions exceeding $5,000 and is barred 
from transferring any assets out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Those terms, plus a financial disclosure to the OTS that he has already 
provided, had previously been imposed on Keating by a temporary restraining 
order issued by a federal judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department reached the agreement, which was filed in the Los 
Angeles court, on behalf of the OTS, an agency of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS had previously ordered Keating to prove his assertion that he is broke. 
The thrift agency partially froze his assets in connection with its efforts to 
recover $41 million from Keating and five associates. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Keating on behalf of OTS on Aug. 
17. Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued a temporary restraining order on Aug. 22 
requiring Keating to abide by OTS' financial restrictions for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The government's enforcement efforts stem from the collapse of Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, which Keating controlled and has been accused of 
looting. Regulators estimate the failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion, ranking 
with Miami's CenTrust Bank as the costliest S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
Keating earned huge salaries, lived lavishly and contributed heavily to 
politicians while he headed American Continental Corp., a development company 
based in Phoenix that owned Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
His case has attracted particular attention because of his $1.3 million in 
contributions to the campaigns of five senators.

TUCSON ELECTRIC SUES EDISON OVER MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: THE AILING ARIZONA POWER COMPANY HOPED TO MERGE WITH SDG&amp;E 
ITSELF. IT SEEKS DAMAGES BUT DOESN'T ASK TO BAR THE OTHER MARRIAGE. 
</P>

Financially ailing Tucson Electric Power Co. on Wednesday filed a 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Southern California Edison Co. in 
connection with Edison's 1988 proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., a move that eventually derailed Tucson Electric's previously proposed 
merger with SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks damages, interest payments and attorneys' fees that could total 
"hundreds of millions of dollars," Tucson Electric spokesman Roger Yohem said. 
But he said the suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, does not attempt to 
block Edison's pending merger with SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit is totally groundless and without merit," Edison spokesman Lew Phelps 
said. "Tucson Electric Power, at the time that it agreed to terminate its 
merger agreement with SDG&amp;E, indicated that it wasn't damaged as a 
consequence of the termination." 
</P>
<P>
Phelps added that Tucson Electric, "by its own admission, is in dire financial 
health and they're apparently grasping at straws." 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers said the unexpected suit could further complicate the 
already complex and controversial $2.4-billion stock swap merger between 
SDG&amp;E and Edison that is being reviewed by federal and state regulators. If 
completed, the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger would create the nation's largest 
investor-owned utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the Tucson utility was weakened financially by 
Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. Edison's intervention dashed Tucson 
Electric's hope of spreading its excess power generation among the broadened 
customer base that a merger with SDG&amp;E would have created. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot thickens with this lawsuit," said Michael Shames, executive director 
of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group that is 
opposing Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. "If the (Tucson 
Electric-SDG&amp;E) merger had gone through, Tucson would be in a lot better 
position that it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric's claim that Edison's uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E weakened the 
Arizona utility financially "is accurate to a degree," according to Doug 
Brooks, director of the Arizona Corporate Commission's Residential Utility 
Consumers Office. However, "a lot has gone on with Tucson Electric Power other 
than the failure of the merger agreement," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tucson-based utility "took some significant hits last October" when the 
Arizona Corporations Commission ordered the utility's shareholders to absorb a 
significant portion of costs associated with new coal-fired electrical 
generating units, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric reported an $87.4-million net loss on $233 million in revenue 
for the six-month period ended June 30. The utility reported a $41.4-million 
net profit and $260 million in revenue for the like period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric's stock, which closed at $53 per share on July 26, 1988, the 
day that Edison unveiled its uninvited merger with SDG&amp;E, has traded in 
recent weeks at about $10 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson Electric's suit names both Edison and SCEcorp, its Rosemead-based 
parent. SCEcorp hopes to merge SDG&amp;E into its Edison subsidiary.

Junk Bond Index Plunges: Reflecting what appears to be the worst month ever for 
the volatile junk bond market, the Salomon Bros. high-yield market index fell 
3.87% in August. The index's decline, its biggest on record, came amid weakness 
in the overall bond and stock markets after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
In the junk bond market, some of the hardest hit securities were those of 
companies in cyclical business such as National Gypsum Co., a building 
materials firm, and Burlington Holdings, a textile maker.

Car, Truck Sales Plunge: Car and truck sales tumbled 21% in the last 10 selling 
days of August, the nation's auto makers reported. They attributed the decline 
more to a weak economy than higher gasoline prices stemming from Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 major car and truck makers in the United States said they sold vehicles 
at an average daily rate of 38,943, compared to 49,276 during the same period 
last year, when incentives lured buyers to showrooms. Car sales during the Aug. 
21-31 period dropped 18.8% and truck sales were off 24.9%. Sales of cars made 
by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. were down 27% during 
the period while sales of cars made by Japanese companies in North America rose 
26.5%. For the entire month, with import sales included, combined car and truck 
sales in the United States fell 17% from last August.

Deposit Insurance Reforms Urged: The chairman of the House Banking Committee 
called for a broad range of steps to bolster the nation's deposit insurance 
system, with closer regulation and the creation of a new agency. The proposals 
by Democrat Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas -- the first comprehensive proposals to 
overhaul deposit insurance -- would boost the costs for depositors at banks, 
thrifts and credit unions as well as the institutions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez essentially called for limitations on insurance coverage to amounts 
authorized by law, arguing that nearly all deposits today are effectively 
insured -- notwithstanding the limit of $100,000. The plan would require 
regulators to take quick action when an institution loses capital, and make 
holding companies responsible for losses suffered by affiliates.

PRODIGY TO HIKE ITS RATES, OFFER MORE SERVICES 
</P>

<P>
The Prodigy electronic information service today will announce price increases 
and a host of new features. The moves are meant to draw more computer users to 
the fast-growing service while providing much-needed financial help. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy, introduced nearly two years ago, also will trumpet its "nationwide 
rollout." Starting today, more than 90% of U.S. households will have access to 
Prodigy with a local, toll-free phone call, company officials say. Previously, 
Prodigy was available toll free to 65% of the nation's homes, including most of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by IBM and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Prodigy is the nation's No. 2 
"on-line" service for home computer users. It claims 465,000 subscribers in 
267,000 households, second only to Compuserve, which serves 580,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy has made an unprecedented effort to hook a broad cross-section of 
consumers on computerized shopping, stock trading and other electronic 
publishing features. 
</P>
<P>
But the venture has yet to turn a profit and by one account has produced $750 
million in losses -- a figure called a "gross overestimate" by Prodigy. Critics 
have questioned whether Prodigy charges subscribers enough and also fault it 
for limited features and technical shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Prodigy officials confirm that today they will announce new 
features including an encyclopedia and an expanded Consumer Reports library. 
</P>
<P>
The price for Prodigy services, however, will rise for some subscribers. Until 
now, subscribers have paid $9.95 a month. Now, if they continue to pay on a 
monthly basis, the charge will rise to $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
But subscribers now also can buy a one- or two-year subscription: a one-year 
subscription would cost $119, the equivalent of $9.95 a month, and the two-year 
deal is $200, which equals $8.33 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Prodigy will scrap its policy of unlimited free electronic mail 
messaging. Instead, it will let users send, free of charge, up to 30 messages a 
month that go directly to other subscribers. Beyond that, it will charge 25 
cents a message.

VIOLENCE: WHEN FOUR CHILDREN DIED OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN NEW YORK CITY, THE

<P>
The image of 9-year-old Veronica Corales peered from New York newsstands with 
large dark eyes and a smile so innocent that she could subdue even the most 
shrill tabloid's front page. Still, the headlines screamed: 
</P>
<P>
STRAY SHOT HITS GIRL . . . HER GREAT ADVENTURE ENDS IN TRAGEDY . . . SLEEPING 
GIRL SHOT IN HEAD. 
</P>
<P>
So began a wave of tragedy this summer, heightened by media attention, that 
baffled even those New Yorkers accustomed to living with violence. Little 
children shot and killed by random gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
By August, the city was wrapped up in a collective outrage, shouted in the 
tabloid headlines: 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN IN THE WAR ZONE . . . IT'S NOT DODGE CITY, BUT . . .. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was just a slow news period that slotted little Veronica as the first 
victim of what Newsday later called the "slaughter of innocents." 
</P>
<P>
But more deaths came, one after the other. The ages of the victims became 
impossibly young: A 3-year-old shot as he slept on a fold-out bed; a 
9-month-old killed as he sat in a walker in his grandmother's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The city cried out, to the police, to Mayor David Dinkins: Do something! 
</P>
<P>
But while New York anguished over its "littlest victims," the summer has been 
almost as grisly in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
* A 6-year-old girl was shot by an angry 17-year-old gang member at a birthday 
party in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old Wilmington boy was shot accidentally while he played with a gun 
belonging to his gang-member uncle. 
</P>
<P>
* A 12-year-old boy was shot on a Santa Ana street after a drug deal soured; 
the boy had nothing to do with that deal. 
</P>
<P>
Where, then, is Southern California's outrage -- the headlines, the grief, the 
uproar? Except for the tears of families and friends -- and a few tightly 
written or produced newspaper and TV stories -- Los Angeles and Orange County 
have not reacted with the collective intensity that New Yorkers have. 
</P>
<P>
The anguish is here, as sure as the increase in gang-related crime, police and 
media watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
But, they add, how New York and Los Angeles deal with children's shootings is 
as different as the cities themselves. The reaction, experts say, has been 
affected by such factors as: 
</P>
<P>
* Communities in New York are not separated by miles of interstate. 
</P>
<P>
* Competing tabloid newspapers there sell fast and furious, mostly on 
pedestrian rush-hour streets. 
</P>
<P>
* And, most importantly, although at least four Southern California children 
were fatally shot in one month, the area has not recorded the consecutive tally 
of child shootings -- four dead in nine days -- that sparked New Yorkers' fury. 
</P>
<P>
Where neighborhood violence -- particularly gang violence -- is concerned, it's 
becoming a banner year in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence, according to figures released last month by the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, increased 69% in the first eight months of 1990 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Overall violent crime, the report says, is up 20%. 
</P>
<P>
And, as always, shootings often involve innocent bystanders -- families who 
learn duck-and-cover techniques the way most Southern Californians practice 
earthquake drills. Marie Felix, of the Gang Violence Reduction Project in East 
Los Angeles, reports that as many as 60% of victims of gang-related crime are 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
In New York so far this year, six of the 16 innocent bystanders killed by 
random bullets were children under 16. In 1988, homicide was the fifth cause of 
death of youngsters 14 and younger in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Although the New York Police Department has no statistics distinguishing 
children intentionally slain and those killed by stray bullets, one police 
spokeswoman suggested that misdirected gunfire accounted for only a handful of 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Los Angeles County, cases of children struck down by gunfire are 
not filed under the circumstances of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all homicides," said a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
Still, according to coroners in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 91 children 
under 13 were homicide victims in 1989; of these, 30 were killed by gunfire. 
Authorities do not tally how many were gang- or drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
The counting occurs when newspapers and television reporters add up homicide 
totals -- and fuel public outcry by portraying related events as crime waves. 
</P>
<P>
Police here maintain that residents get angry -- and often call their offices 
seeking solutions to violence, whether the crime occurs in their neighborhood 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some apathy (in the public) towards crime, but to what degree, I 
think, depends on the community and the circumstances," said Lt. Robert Helton 
of the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
With the killing of an innocent child, like Pedro Sanchez Hernandez, 12, in 
Santa Ana Aug. 14,the outcry increases, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, struck down by gunfire stemming from an unsuccessful drug deal, was 
simply walking down his neighborhood street with his brother, Gus, 16. 
</P>
<P>
Gus said he heard someone yell "drive-by" and "I ducked behind a car and I 
yelled for my brother to follow. I saw this car go by and then I heard four 
shots. I looked for my brother and there he was, dead." 
</P>
<P>
"There, the (public's) outcry was obvious to us," Helton said. "As the age of 
the victim decreases, the public speaks louder." 
</P>
<P>
And, it seems, nowhere was it louder this summer than in New York, where the 
killings began to overlap. Hardly was one child buried before the media told of 
another shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To firebrand columnists like Jim Dwyer of Newsday, the children are "a defining 
issue" for New York. "If you're dead to this issue, you're dead to all 
existence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the New York press agree that the wave of public outrage over 
crime was picking up momentum far before Veronica was killed. The succession of 
child killings was "like a tornado touching down," Dwyer said. 
</P>
<P>
New York's three tabloids -- the New York Post, the New York Daily News and 
Newsday -- each repeatedly ran stories about the killings on their front pages. 
As papers that rely heavily on street sales to pedestrians in transit, the 
tabloids are often accused of pulling no stops to sell papers. 
</P>
<P>
But as the killings progressed, even the staid New York Times ran front-page 
stories on the public outrage surrounding the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasters also joined in the coverage. Where the tabloids were "expectedly 
sensational," said Dr. Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Media Studies 
Center at Columbia University, "television has been breathlessly sensational" 
in covering the same story. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the media may have treated the young victims in so spectacular a 
fashion because other big stories seemed to have run their course, Dennis said. 
There was not much more to report at the time on the Central Park Jogger case; 
Donald Trump's financial woes had become old news; at the same time, the media 
had a heightened interest in the plight of urban children because of the Lisa 
Steinberg child abuse case. 
</P>
<P>
The journalistic gridlock broke with this summer's consecutive killings of 
children, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, particularly Dinkins, became the media's prime targets. Dwyer, the 
first to ask Dinkins what he would do to protect New York's children from such 
senseless killings as Veronica Corales', said he was frustrated by the mayor's 
"tepid response." 
</P>
<P>
But while columnists made stinging commentaries about the city administration 
and Dinkins took steps -- such as hiring 1,058 new police officers -- the 
violence continued. 
</P>
<P>
While crime -- random drive-by shootings, in particular -- has become a big, 
poignant even topic of news coverage in Los Angeles, there are major 
differences between this market and New York, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief differences is geographic sprawl. Southern Californians do not 
live shoulder-to-shoulder and are not confronted with competing tabloid 
newspapers; when reading about crime in other neighborhoods, they may feel as 
if it is happening in someplace far removed. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of outcry here does not reflect a lack of media attention to 
children's shooting deaths, said Edwin Guthman, a USC journalism professor. 
"We're dealing with two different cities," he said. "My impression is that Los 
Angeles has been given a lot of local media coverage to these shootings, 
especially when drive-bys involve innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
While the amount of public outcry can be related to the amount of media 
coverage given gang warfare, Guthman said, "I don't think Los Angeles feels as 
if it has been slighted. I'm certainly quite conscious of a lot of sad stories 
in this area. . . . I don't think we care any less about it than New York." 
</P>
<P>
Said Santa Ana police Lt. Helton: "What's played up in the news can bring the 
problem to the forefront, be the igniter of public outcry. After some of our 
recent violence, I wouldn't be surprised to see outcry escalate, with the right 
kind of rallying point. Here though, that particular case -- or cases -- hasn't 
come forward. We're fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
The random shootings that so often claim the lives of children are on the 
increase largely because the gangs have demonstrated that they no longer care 
about who gets in their way, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
What Helton and other law enforcement officials, see as a growing danger is an 
increasing lack of remorse in gang members and drug dealers, who rarely stop to 
decide who should and should not be shot. 
</P>
<P>
"From my experience, they (gang members) have very little if any remorse for 
innocent victims. When they are looking for somebody and an innocent bystander 
happens to wander in their path, there is no concern," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, neighborhood gangs once followed a time-honored tradition 
of not involving innocent lives in their street wars. But at the Gang Violence 
Reduction Project, activists are noticing that (and other traditions) are 
beginning to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, from her work counseling current and former gang members in East Los 
Angeles, has noticed that "things are evolving," in traditional neighborhood 
gangs. "Meaning, that we didn't used to shoot in an area where innocents would 
be shot," she said. "Now things are at the point where gang members say 'I'm 
going to take care of it -- if someone else gets in the way, too bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Garry Adams, also of the Santa Ana police, said that even with the outcry 
surrounding Hernandez's death, the public -- and police -- may be overwhelmed 
by helplessness: "There's a certain amount of outrage, but how do you deal with 
it when you have random shootings such as these . . . when the gangs apparently 
aren't caring about who is on the other side of the wall they are shooting at? 
These are our questions to answer first, before anything can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Jones, of the Youth and Family Center in Inglewood, has watched news 
from New York with interest -- and sees parallels between New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a disease, starting with drugs, but certainly including 
everything else -- gangs, guns, violence," she said. "We are in need of new 
healing." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, a new Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment made 
up of community action groups from all across Los Angeles, along with USC, UCLA 
and the Department of Justice, has formed to reduce violence in crime-ridden 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid. I don't think anybody learns to live with this or accept it 
as part of life," Jones said. "There are many community programs around. But 
they become so fragmented after awhile, and far apart -- we are trying to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
"These bullets, coming through the walls and hitting innocent people . . . 
people are really afraid of guns," Jones said. "We as a people -- and I as a 
mother -- are enraged at what's going on in our community. We are going to have 
to find a way to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"And we are going to have to do it for ourselves. In that way, we're no 
different from New York or anywhere else."

CHINESE MUSLIMS STRUGGLE TO FORGE DISTINCT IDENTITY; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: IN THE U.S., MIDDLE EASTERN CUSTOMS OFTEN DOMINATE THE PRACTICE OF 
ISLAM. BUT ASIANS HAVE THEIR OWN RITUALS.

Sophia and Jamillah Ma steal a minute to sit with a visitor at an 
out-of-the-way table in the China Islamic restaurant their family owns in 
Rosemead. They help run the business with four other siblings and in-laws. It 
is a bright, bustling place with a communal spirit and "halal -- in English 
that means Kosher -- food," says Jamillah Ma, her head covered with the hijab, 
or scarf, that many Muslim women wear. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Taiwan to a family that has been Muslim "so far back" she can't 
remember how long and married to a Libyan Muslim, Jamillah Ma believes the 
hijab is an essential expression of her faith. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sign of a strong believer, but it doesn't mean that a woman who 
does not wear the hijab is bad or not practicing her faith," says Ma, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister's head is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
She used to wear the hijab, says Sophia Ma, who came to the United States in 
1979 with the rest of her family. But the 25-year-old Cal State Los Angeles 
student couldn't stand the reaction of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I would participate in computer lab -- two people are supposed to share a 
computer terminal -- but no one wanted to share with me," she says softly. 
"They would all look at me very strangely, so I decided to go with the American 
way. But I still keep my belief in my heart." 
</P>
<P>
One day, says her sister Jamillah, "I wish she will be covered all the time," 
but that is a personal jihad, or struggle, that Sophia must resolve for 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Persecuted throughout their history in China and dispersed after the rise to 
power of Mao Zedong, Chinese Muslims who have come to America are struggling to 
establish a distinct identity for themselves and a network of support for this 
"minority of minorities" among Asian followers of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam is a world religion. It covers not only the people who are speaking 
Arabic, which is the misunderstanding most people have. It covers all kinds of 
nationalities," says Ali Jiang, the general secretary of Chinese Muslims 
International, a year-old association of Muslims of Chinese descent based in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs, in fact, compose only 10% of the Muslim world. Indonesia is the nation 
with the largest Islamic population. 
</P>
<P>
"Each national community has its own cultural background, language, rituals. 
Though we have the same religion with other nationalities, we feel very 
uncomfortable when we are with other groups," Jiang says in a phone 
conversation from his home in the Jackson Heights section of Queens, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in Brooklyn close to a Turkish mosque," he says. "A lot of 
Pakistani people went there too. The service was conducted in Turkish, and the 
people treated me there as a friend. The Pakistani people treated us (Chinese) 
as brothers and they invited us to all kinds of parties. But when they came 
together, they were talking in Urdu and we felt very isolated." 
</P>
<P>
There are no Chinese mosques in his community, Jiang says, but he would like to 
see one established there -- wherever there are large numbers of Muslims of 
Chinese descent or other Asian Muslims who share cultural traditions with the 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for certain how many Muslims of Chinese descent live in the United 
States; one of the goals of the embryonic Chinese Muslims International is to 
find out. The group has been distributing membership applications throughout 
the United States, usually leaving them in Chinese restaurants for customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We Chinese Muslims are scattered in this nation everywhere. There are lots of 
Muslim centers in the United States where we can pray together," says Iliyas 
Ting, 58, founder of Chinese Muslims International, but there is no group that 
can address the specific needs of Chinese Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
When a baby is born to a Chinese Muslim, "they have to be circumcised and they 
have to be given a name. The mother may have to write home to a 
great-grandfather in Hong Kong or Taiwan to be given the name for the baby. It 
is very difficult for the Chinese lady who does not know Arabic or English to 
communicate" this ritual to an "imam who is a Middle Eastern Muslim," Ting says 
from his home in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"We Chinese Muslims are a minority of a minority, scattered in this nation," 
Ting adds. "If you don't have an association, which is like a beehive, you have 
no place to go, no place to ask for explanations, for mutual support. In the 
long run, what will happen is that we will be disunited." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for certain how many Muslims are in China, either, where Islam was 
introduced more than a 1,000 years ago by Arab and Iranian warriors and 
merchants. Chinese Muslims International literature estimates that there are 
more than 30 million followers of the Prophet Mohammed in China and that they 
are concentrated in most major cities and in the vast northwest regions of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Encyclopedia Americana offers much smaller estimates, saying that the 
mostly Muslim Hui -- China's second largest minority -- total 7.2 million. The 
Uygurs, another minority group, total 6 million and are Turkic-speaking Sunni 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese communist revolution brought Mao Zedong to power in 1949, 
"lots of Chinese Muslims ran away," says Pat H. Zaw, the Los Angeles 
representative for Chinese Muslims International. "They are scattered all over 
the world. There are a lot in Saudi Arabia, a lot still in Taiwan, Korea, a 
whole bunch in Canada and in America, and even in Africa. On top of that, many 
families were separated" while fleeing communist rule, she says. "I myself come 
from Burma, which is right on the border of China." Many Chinese Muslims fled 
the country, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Zaw, 43, came to the United States in 1976 with her husband, Rick, and their 
9-month-old son, Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
The niece of Chinese Muslim International founder Ting, Zaw and other Asian 
Muslims note that their cultural traditions allow for an expression of Islam 
that is far less restrictive than Arab and Middle Eastern expressions of the 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
Further, they assert that Islam as they practice it is truer to the spirit of 
the teaching of the Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
Implicitly, they are challenging the cultural hegemony of Arabs over Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very sad," says Zaw, "that Arab culture has become confused with Islam." 
</P>
<P>
It is "100% true that Arabs, Middle Eastern culture in general and Pakistani 
culture," have come to dominate Islam, says Dr. Fathi Osman, an Egyptian-born 
former professor of intellectual history at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Osman, 60, now the resident scholar at the Islamic Center of Southern 
California in Los Angeles, says that it is not only Chinese Muslims who cannot 
identify with the cultural traditions of these other nationalities: "There are 
differences between the Arabs and Pakistanis, between Western Arabs and Eastern 
Arabs, between the Moroccans and the Jordanians and the Iraqis." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Muslims are attempting to bridge these differences by 
forging a distinct identity as American Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Maher Hathout, spokesman for the Islamic Center in Los Angeles, which Zaw 
and the Mas attend, says he "sympathizes very much with the needs of Chinese 
Muslims to express their own ethnicity and culture within Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do at the center is advocate that we have all the pieces 
of the mosaic in one place. Then let us come together and shine with an 
American Muslim identity. Under that, we can find Muslims of Chinese 
background, Indian background, Arabic background, each in harmony with the 
other. That is being done successfully at the Islamic Center. We have Chinese 
members, and we are de-emphasizing the Arab nature of the center. We are trying 
to make it as pluralistic as America and as Islam meant things to be." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Jamillah Ma, Zaw does not wear the hijab outside of the the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she says, firmly shaking her head in the dining room of her Downey home. 
"We Chinese Muslim women don't wear that." And the veils that many Middle 
Eastern Muslim women wear is simply a "fashion" started by "Persian ladies in 
high society," she says. "It became a fad and people began to say that all 
Muslim women must cover their faces. This is a misinterpretation of Islam." 
</P>
<P>
Many aspects of Islam are misunderstood by non-Muslims and Muslims alike, say 
many American Muslims. But for all the misinterpretations and stereotypes that 
many claim pervade Western thinking, America is the best place to be a Muslim, 
say Marayati, Hathout and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy my religion so much in this country," says Jamillah Ma. "I really feel 
I can practice my religion here more than in my country. In Taiwan, if I wear 
the hijab, people would laugh, give me a hard time. Here I can cover myself and 
go anywhere. Here -- because Muslims pray five times a day -- I can go into a 
parking lot for privacy when I travel and make my prayers. American people 
might see me, they may feel something since they are not Muslim, but they never 
bother me. I never feel scared or shy. People have their own beliefs, but they 
have respect for other religions." 
</P>
<P>
The chatter of lunchtime patrons and the clatter of heavy dishes are the only 
sounds competing with Jamillah Ma's words as she sits with her sister. Sophia 
Ma listens to the older woman attentively, deferring to her, occasionally 
translating the English questions of an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about her home life, Sophia Ma says, "my parents are very 
restrictive, very conservative." She is not allowed to date. All her friends 
are female. "I am happy with my social life," she says. "It is very plain. I go 
to school, I come back and work, go home and study, talk with my friends about 
school and sometimes we go shopping, to the mall." What her life will be like 
later depends on the man she marries. 
</P>
<P>
"When she marries, " Jamillah Ma says, "my parents will have to arrange it. But 
they cannot force her to marry a man. She can talk to the man as long as she 
feels satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone been picked for her yet? 
</P>
<P>
Sophia Ma's large brown eyes widen and she smiles slightly. "Somebody told my 
parents about this man from Saudi Arabia. My parents mentioned him to me, but I 
think he is too old for me, so I refused him." 
</P>
<P>
Because Jamillah Ma's husband, Adel Elashegh, 31, is Libyan, "my social life is 
. . . just like Middle Eastern culture," she says. 
</P>
<P>
They met in the restaurant where Elashegh was a frequent customer, always 
leaving Jamillah a big tip, she says, "though I hardly gave him any service." 
The auto mechanic offered to fix her 1981 Datsun 210, always in need of oil or 
a tuneup, she says. Those frequent meetings led to long talks about Islam and, 
eventually, marriage. They have a daughter, 9. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Jamillah says, she stays in the kitchen or bedroom when male guests 
come to her house. When female guests come, her husband leaves the room, she 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
"No," says Pat Zaw, shaking her head again, that's not the Chinese Muslim 
woman's way. "When my husband and I have company, I sit and talk with them 
because they are my friends. I don't feel ashamed to come out. I am used to 
this kind of life, just like any American woman when her husband brings home 
friends, we talk and we socialize. Of course, when I say we socialize, there is 
no liquor, no beer, no wine, that is part of our religion. 
</P>
<P>
The social segregation of men and women in the home "has nothing to do with 
Islam itself," says Hathout of the Islamic center. These social taboos are 
"ancient tribal customs, not only the tribes of the Middle East but tribal 
structures in general try to overprotect -- to use a nice term for it -- women. 
But this has nothing to do with religion." 
</P>
<P>
Hathout adds: "Islam in Chinese and other Asian cultures are generally less 
adherent to tribal habits. When I see a Chinese woman expressing herself more 
freely, I consider her closer to the Islamic spirit, departing from tribal 
practices and moving toward the fairer nature of relationships," espoused by 
Islam.

A HUE AND CRY OVER LEGAL PADS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE RECYCLING MOVEMENT HAS MADE THE OFFICE FAVORITE A BIT OF AN 
ENDANGERED SPECIES. IT SEEMS WHITE IS THE COLOR OF CHOICE -- AND VALUE -- FOR 
RECYCLERS.

<P>
For writers, lawyers, business executives and anyone who has ever coaxed their 
gray cells into action by doodling, the yellow legal pad provides an almost 
mystical link to the muses. 
</P>
<P>
But the yellow pad's popularity is being threatened. In some offices, it is 
becoming a white yellow legal pad because white recycled paper brings more 
money than color scrap; in others, the legal pad is showing up in ecological 
designer shades, from sage green to soft mauve. 
</P>
<P>
Prompting the color debate is the national recycling trend. In guidelines 
published last February, the Environmental Protection Agency set a goal of 25% 
reduction in waste by municipalities by 1992. California law requires 
municipalities to achieve a 25% recycling rate for all waste products by 1995 
and 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Paper Institute, a national trade group, one-third of 
the country's 600 paper mills are already producing only recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
In California, corporations like Hewlett-Packard, Wells Fargo Bank and Intel 
Corp., as well as government workers from Orange County to San Francisco, have 
started tossing their paper trash into office recycling bins. 
</P>
<P>
But by saving scratch pads and memos from becoming landfill, environmentalists 
are raising the issue of what color paper their offices will use. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is a matter of ecological economics, paper industry experts say. 
Colored paper is a lower grade than white and, while some paper recyclers 
handle all kinds of paper, others want only white, which brings more money. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that throw all their paper -- regardless of color -- into one bin may 
not get the same returns on their efforts as those firms that separate white 
from colored paper. 
</P>
<P>
"If white paper gets you the highest price, why buy paper that's yellow or 
blue?" says Joan Edwards, head of the Los Angeles city government's recycling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, Edwards says, the city plans "to purge" its yellow pads. Rather 
than earning nothing for recycling mixed paper, the city expects to make 
anywhere from about $50 to $80 a ton from its all-white paper program. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be like getting rid of your security blanket," Edwards admits of the 
switch. "People will say, 'Oh, no, we can't do that.' But after it's done, 
they'll realize it doesn't make a lot of difference whether the paper was 
yellow or white." (Some manufacturers, however, say yellow is easier on the 
eyes than white, although they are similarly priced.) 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing magical about yellow paper," insists Tony Massaro, director of 
the Denver Mayor's Office of Environmental Affairs, which began buying 
all-white office paper last fall, earning about $60 a ton for recycling it. 
</P>
<P>
Massaro reports no withdrawal symptoms, even among the city's attorneys. "We 
haven't had a single complaint," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, however, a recycling 
program begun a month ago allows the 225 attorneys to continue note-making on 
yellow legal pads. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawyer with the yellow legal pad is etched into everyone's mind as the 
appropriate way to do business, and I think there would have been a reluctance 
to give that up," says Christopher Crain, a lawyer with the firm who helped 
spearhead the recycling effort. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which belongs to a building-wide recycling program, chose "the 
convenience of using any kind of paper we want" over profit-making, explains 
Crain, saying that by recycling, the company gets reduced trash-hauling rates. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, Crain hopes, will be getting lawyers to separate colored and 
white paper into two recycling bins. "We're trying to raise consciousness 
slowly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The American Paper Institute reports a drop in colored paper products -- from 
16% in 1974 to 10% in 1988. "We're seeing a big movement toward white office 
paper," says Marshall Friedman, President of U.S. Recycling Inc. in Denver, 
which operates 50 collection sites across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"They're finding it brings them some money," says Virgil Horton, the paper 
institute's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The yellow legal pad has also been victimized by the claim that it is more 
difficult to strip yellow than other colors from paper, says Bill Moore, head 
of recycling for Waste Management Inc. in Oak Brook, Ill., the country's 
largest firm handling waste. Moore, who writes on a yellow legal pad, calls 
that claim "a myth." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any problem (with recycling yellow paper)," says Harold Bergman, 
president of Riverside Paper Corporation in Wisconsin, which recycles 
7,000-pound loads of paper in Mixmaster-like pulpers that strip off the ink. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the year, the company introduced an ecology line of paper in 
colors such as mauve and sage green, and since then, Bergman says, sales of 
legal pads have doubled. Focus groups preferred ecology colors, he says, saying 
they were easier on their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, when it comes to sales, white is still the company's biggest 
seller in writing tablets. But, says Bergman, "we're selling as many yellow 
pads as ever."

ARCHITECTURE: INPUT PUT A BETTER FACE ON 2 COASTAL HOTELS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some architects would rather face a school of hungry sharks than the layers of 
design review most projects go through these days. In particular, designing 
buildings along the coast, where local sentiments run especially deep, can be a 
touchy process. 
</P>
<P>
Yet two elegant new oceanfront hotels -- the Sheraton Grande at Torrey Pines in 
La Jolla and L'Auberge Del Mar -- prove that extensive design review can 
produce better buildings. Feedback from local government and community factions 
helped, in both cases, to produce thoughtfully designed hotels with minimal 
impact on San Diego's precious coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, L'Auberge Del Mar is the more successful design. Inside and out, it 
conveys a low-key, homey warmth through intimate scale and materials such as 
brick and wood shingles and beams. The Sheraton, by contrast, is a sound, 
modern building that suffers from a few lapses in detailing. Rooftop vents and 
air-conditioning equipment, for example, are eyesores to motorists on North 
Torrey Pines Road. An exterior of white stucco and reflective glass makes the 
place about as inviting as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A significant portion of L'Auberge's sensitive design is directly attributable 
to concerned Del Mar citizens and politicians. Architects Jim Galvin and Joe 
Cristilli of Galvin Cristilli Architects spent four years refining the project 
to meet the community's desires. The $30-million, 123-room hotel, which opened 
in July of last year, was subject to voter approval. It didn't pass until its 
second time on the ballot in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The city had good reason to proceed with caution. The hotel site is a key 
downtown corner at 15th Street and Camino Del Mar, where other corners are 
occupied by a bank, the new Del Mar Plaza retail complex and Stratford Square, 
a 1927 Tudor-style building. Strong traditions came with the location. Many 
locals fondly remember the 1909 Tudor-style Inn at Del Mar that was torn down 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
But Galvin and Cristilli's new hotel suits downtown Del Mar well, even though 
its Tudor-based design has a contemporary flair. 
</P>
<P>
L'Auberge takes many of its cues from Stratford Square, which houses the 
popular Carlos &amp; Annie's Cafe. Steep, gabled roofs and tan stucco walls 
make the two buildings cousins. But the architects did not imitate Stratford 
Square's Tudor half-timbering with its vertical, horizontal and diagonal boards 
applied to exterior walls that give an appearance dating back to 16th-Century 
England. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and citizens were as concerned about the new hotel's siting and 
size as they were about its style. Set back generously from the street, with 
parking well concealed underground, the hotel is a gentle presence. Wood 
trellises shade public areas and soften the hotel's visual impact. Lots of 
brick adds to the Old World atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
A retail annex and the hotel's main restaurant are both near the street. These 
public attractions also make the hotel an especially good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The key corner of the project -- at 15th and Camino Del Mar -- is essentially 
an offering to the citizens of the city, and comes complete with a small 
concrete amphitheater. A park-like pedestrian entrance is enhanced by a 
man-made stream and waterfall, which mask the din of nearby traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cars reach the project via driveways slightly removed from the corner, thereby 
keeping the pedestrian entrance clear. And hotel rooms are arranged in three 
wings, which are aligned with neighboring blocks of condominiums to the west in 
order to save view corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the hotel's main entry off Camino Del Mar a gabled, glassed roof floods 
the lobby with natural light. Overstuffed chairs, a Citizen Kane-sized brick 
fireplace and big ceiling beams painted with a delicate floral pattern give the 
place a country-style charm. 
</P>
<P>
The $60-million, 400-room Sheraton, which opened in November at the edge of 
Torrey Pines Golf Course near UC San Diego, could use more of L'Auberge Del 
Mar's careful detailing, especially on the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Architects Welton Becket Associates of Santa Monica gave the building a stark 
front of white stucco and copper-colored reflective-glass windows with green 
mullions. With its wide concrete driveways, the Sheraton looks more like an 
office building than a place you'd want to spend a relaxing weekend. By 
contrast, the pocket decks, patios and outdoor public dining areas visible 
around the edges of L'Auberge Del Mar make it immediately inviting. 
</P>
<P>
In its favor, however, the Sheraton makes only a minimal impact on its coastal 
bluff site. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of the crash danger posed by ocean-borne fighter jets leaving Miramar 
Naval Air Station a few miles inland, the Navy played a key role in dictating 
the hotel's low profile. Designed for maximum safety, the structure is partly 
embedded in the bluff, with several key meeting rooms and a main restaurant on 
lower floors. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the University City Planning Group served as a watchdog during the 
design process, making sure the hotel would suit its site and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Architecturally, the Sheraton borrows from its neighbor, Scripps Clinic, which 
was designed by Edward Durell Stone in the 1970s, as well as the Salk 
Institute, architect Louis Kahn's 1960s concrete masterpiece. The hotel's 
pattern of square windows vaguely echoes the squares of Scripps Clinic's 
exterior. Rooms in the hotel's wings are angled to capture fantastic views of 
the golf course and ocean, in the same way that the Salk Institute's labs and 
offices gain their views. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is laid out with four wings strung behind the long front building, 
which houses the lobby and main hallways. Between the wings, three large 
terraces provide great ocean views. A pool in the middle courtyard is 
surrounded by classical stone railings with large concrete posts topped with 
flower-filled urns. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the Sheraton is a mixed bag. A high-beamed ceiling over the grand lobby 
makes the space as comfortable as a Rocky Mountain ski lodge. At the back of 
this impressive space, wide stairs descend to the Torreyana Grille restaurant. 
Nearby, a curving wall of glass provides light and great views of a pool and 
formal terrace outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton is decorated in a vaguely Southwestern style with expensive 
materials and furnishings, including slate floors, marble-topped counters and 
odd metal lighting fixtures in the form of gnarled shrubs. A provocative art 
collection ranges from abstract and figurative pieces to wiry metal coyotes 
poised in niches. Sometimes the materials get too glitzy, as with the the 
gigantic, copper-trimmed fireplace and the mirrors behind overhead planters. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of San Diego's new hotels downtown, 
as well as in the Golden Triangle near University Towne Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of the new hotels downtown and in 
the Golden Triangle area, near University Towne Center. And both prove that 
when architects lend an ear to outside opinions, they can create buildings that 
please both their users and their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Canceled: Because of limited audience response, a symposium on Frank Lloyd 
Wright scheduled for Sept. 15 has been canceled. The program, organized by the 
San Diego Architectural Foundation and sponsored by the foundation and the San 
Diego Museum of Art, will not be rescheduled. Tickets can be refunded through 
Ticketmaster.

City meetings, including City Council and Planning Commission meetings, will be 
held in the board room of the Monrovia Unified School District for the next 
month and a half while the City Hall Council Chamber is remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
The $114,000 remodeling project will include new carpeting, drapes, seating and 
a redesigned dais for the council members. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday also approved a $66,525 plan to upgrade audiovisual 
equipment for the council meetings, which are broadcast on KGEM cable 
television. City Hall was built in 1954 and has never been completely remodeled 
before. Meetings through the month of October will be held at school district 
headquarters at 325 E. Huntington Drive.

VOTE ON NEW POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to schedule a special election Feb. 26, 1991, 
for a vote on the proposed construction of an $8.85-million police station. 
</P>
<P>
A special citywide election will cost the city about $18,000, City Clerk 
Phyllis McCarville said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members decided against placing the measure on the November ballot 
because they said there was not enough time to campaign effectively for the new 
building. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens commission has recommended replacing the current police station, 
built in 1961, because it is overcrowded and does not meet earthquake safety 
standards. The new, 30,000-square-foot station would be built at Ivy and Lime 
avenues and would be financed by an annual assessment of $49 from each 
residence for 27 years.

11 ARRESTED IN DRUG BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police last Friday arrested 11 people at a suspected cocaine "rock house" on 
West Montana Avenue, three weeks after city officials threw a block party aimed 
at reclaiming the crime-plagued street from cocaine dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, ranging in age from 23 to 47 and charged with mostly drug-related 
violations, were taken into custody after police served a search warrant at an 
apartment located on the street's 100 block. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they seized 19 rocks of cocaine, one rifle, two handguns and more 
than $400 cash. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 9, lollipops, cookies and punch were served to more than 100 of the 
street's residents, who cheered when Police Chief Joseph Santoro warned drug 
dealers to pack up and get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, they weren't listening," Santoro this week said of the dealers. 
"(But) this is just the beginning. We won't give up until we've made Montana 
Avenue a place where people can feel safe and raise their children."

BEST BETS: DIG ARCHEOLOGY AT ALBINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The archeological history of the Ventura area will unfold Sunday at an open 
house at the Albinger Archeological Museum in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will have the opportunity to discover what archeology says about 
the area's past and how its research techniques work. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a simulated dig where people can actually sift for buried genuine 
artifacts," said Skip Robinson, a recreation coordinator of historic sites 
around Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"The Albinger Museum is an urban archeological site that basically traces the 
five different cultures which have occupied the area the past 3,500 years," he 
said. They are prehistoric inhabitants, Chinese, Spaniards, Chumash Indians and 
Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
Along with tours and slide presentations, exercises in rebuilding broken 
pottery will be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"Two hands-on artifacts tables will be set up for folks to examine, also," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The open house will be held noon to 4 p.m. and there is no charge. The museum 
is located at 113 E. Main St., Ventura. Call 648-5823.

THE U.A. THOUSAND OAKS HAS BEEFY HOT DOGS, GOOD POPCORN AND CLEAN -- BUT GREEN 
-- RESTROOMS.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Here it is, the third in a series of reviews of Ventura County movie theaters. 
This time we visited the five-screeA. Thousand Oaks in the Oaks Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Not bad at all. The hot dog tasted like a top-flight ballpark dog. It's 
all beef and not too salty. On the down side, the bun seemed stale. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn: Good. Actually tasted like popcorn. It's the kind of popcorn that you 
find yourself munching on long after you think you've had enough. A lot of 
butter, but it turned out to be pretty well-dispersed. Caution: A small popcorn 
is pretty large -- at $2.50, it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Large, clean and green. Yes, it's truly frog-colored, from the floor 
to the walls to the deodorizing liquid they use. Plenty of mirrors -- two 
full-length and three smaller. Evidently the teens want to look goooooood. Nice 
fake wood paneling on the stall doors. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: No music, just the sound of the concession stand cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Line of the Day: "Oh my God . . . I'm so grossed" -- a teen-age girl's response 
to a teen-age boy's story about drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas Adobe's recent silent film night, featuring Rudolph Valentino's "The 
Sheik," attracted an audience of about 140, twice the number that had been 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Adobe historian Richard Senate said that because of the success, a silent film 
series featuring "The Mark of Zorro" and "The Shriek of Arabi" is being planned 
next summer. "Shriek" is a short parody of "The Sheik" and, as for the 
original, the sand dune scenes were filmed in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "The Sheik," the National Park Service will conclude its summer 
series of silent movies Sept. 15 and 16 with presentations of the sequel, "Son 
of the Sheik." It was Valentino's last film before he died at 31 from 
complications from appendicitis surgery. The film will be shown both days at 
the Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area

The big-budget sequel was not filmed in Oxnard, the producers opting for the 
larger dunes of the Mojave Desert, Senate said. 
</P>
<P>
How does Senate know so much about the movie world? It helps that his father 
and grandfather worked at MGM -- his father as a painter (one of many, he said, 
who worked on "The Wizard of Oz" sets) and his grandfather as a carpenter. "We 
like to say the family built MGM Studios, which literally my grandfather did," 
he said. LEO SMITH

THEATER REVIEW: 'JERRY'S GIRLS'; 
</P>
<P>
ONE-MAN SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S LOTS OF ACTION AND AMBITIOUS COSTUMES, BUT LITTLE CONTINUITY, WHICH MAY 
BE AN ADVANTAGE.

No, "Jerry's Girls" isn't a Labor Day weekend telethon. Rather, it's a revue of 
songs composed by Jerry Herman for several Broadway plays, among them "Hello, 
Dolly!," "Mame" and "La Cage aux Folles." A local production of the show 
debuted over the Labor Day weekend -- just coincidence, we're sure -- and can 
be seen at the Conejo Players Theater in Thousand Oaks, Sunday afternoons 
through Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
In the Conejo Players version of the show, a cast of 12 women perform just 
under 40 numbers gathered from each of Herman's Broadway plays (except "The 
Grand Tour"). The players also perform a number that was added to "Hello, 
Dolly!" for the film version, a number contributed to the Tommy Tune revue "A 
Day in Hollywood," and two songs ("Two a Day" and "A Show Tune") from "Parade," 
an off-Broadway revue predating his first Broadway production, 1960's "Milk and 
Honey." 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of singing, lots of dancing, ambitious costumes and precious 
little continuity, which may be an advantage, since instead of a plot, even 
more songs can be packed into a show that comes in at two hours, including 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The show is so much an ensemble production that only two of the women are not 
spotlighted in solo or duet numbers, and everybody gets to step out for at 
least a couple of lines. Some of the performers are stronger singers and/or 
dancers than others, but even with its occasional clumsiness ("Tap Your 
Troubles Away" from "Mack and Mabel" comes to mind), the music and the 
performers' undeniable enthusiasm compensate for the lack of spectacle. And 
some of the amateurism is deliberate: "The Man in the Moon" (from "Mame") is a 
much more successful Busby Berkeley parody than anything in "Dames at Sea." 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight is Devery Holmes' reading of "Nelson," the number from "A Day 
in Hollywood" purportedly sung by Jeanette McDonald to Nelson Eddy -- when she 
isn't too pleased with him. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Jan (that's evidently her name, not a title) Faulkner captures low comedy 
honors with two numbers from "Mame." In "Put It Back On" she portrays a 
none-too-desirable burlesque dancer, wearing a feather boa that looks as if 
someone had ripped the tail off Selsdon, the Conejo Players' house cat. In 
"Gooch's Song," she is the pregnant secretary. 
</P>
<P>
A section of songs from "La Cage aux Folles" seems tacked onto the show, as 
indeed it was -- "Jerry's Girls" was conceived (by Herman and Larry Alford) and 
originally produced before Herman's most recent success. Still, the numbers are 
imaginatively performed. As it would be odd to have women portraying female 
impersonators, Anne Evans and the other singers in three of the four numbers 
are dressed as men. The fourth song, "I Am What I Am," is sung by Irene 
Strickland, in a dress. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes range from rather demure swimsuits to elegant cocktail dresses, 
with the singers also dressed as waiters, burlesque dancers and so forth, as 
the numbers demand. No individual costume credit is given, but Betsy Henke is 
listed as coordinator and Ruth Swain credited with hat design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Matheson, Darren Franks and Jim Holmes are the director, choreographer 
and musical director; their work shows ingenuity and skill. A live band -- 
Holmes on piano, plus drummer Ken Dayton and bassist Steve Bringleton -- 
accompany all of the numbers save one, which was inexplicably danced to a 
prerecorded track. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the singer-dancers already mentioned, the cast includes Jennifer 
Beall, Melinda Bridges, Susan Goodman, Trish Hallier, Kathleen Hobson, Shelley 
Saxer and K. Jill Sorgen. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Jerry's Girls" is performed Sunday afternoons at 2:30 only, 
through Sept. 23. The Conejo Players Theater is at 351 S. Moorpark Road in 
Thousand Oaks. Admission is $5. No reservations are accepted, so you're advised 
to arrive early. For further information, call (805) 495-3715.

THE COMPOSER SEES MUSICALS LIKE JIGSAW PUZZLES. THE CONEJO PLAYERS ARE 
PRODUCING TWO OF THEM.

<P>
"Two shows?" Jerry Herman said on learning that the Conejo Players of Thousand 
Oaks are producing two of his musicals. "I'm always pleased when I hear that my 
shows are being done. You lose track." 
</P>
<P>
If Herman's name is not as familiar to casual theater fans as, say, Stephen 
Sondheim's, his work certainly is. He's the only composer-lyricist in history 
to have had three musicals running more than 1,500 consecutive performances 
each on Broadway: "Mame," "Hello, Dolly!" and the 1983 show that will be the 
Conejo Players' November-December production, "La Cage aux Folles." 
</P>
<P>
All three are constantly performed around the world. No wonder Herman loses 
track. 
</P>
<P>
He's one of the few Broadway figures to write both words and music for his 
shows (Sondheim is another). So, when asked which comes first, Herman doesn't 
have to admit to either. 
</P>
<P>
"I do both simultaneously," he said in an interview in Los Angeles. "I don't 
think of lyrics as poetry. I think of them as being permanently attached to 
those notes of music. Writing for me is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. 
I might come up with a first line and part of a melody, then write the end and 
then go back and put in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that there is any one right way to do it, though. When Richard 
Rodgers was collaborating with Lorenz Hart, Rodgers would compose the music 
first. When he wrote with Oscar Hammerstein, the lyrics would come first. It's 
just a matter of how you can get the work done." 
</P>
<P>
Now in his mid-50s, he had become Broadway's youngest composer-lyricist when 
"Milk and Honey" was produced in 1961. The musical was subsequently nominated 
for a Tony and a Grammy. Herman's works also include 1969's "Dear World" and 
1974's "Mack and Mabel." 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry's Girls," which the Conejo Players are currently performing for four 
Sunday matinees, is a selection of songs from all of Herman's Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980 a director named Larry Alford came to me and suggested that it was 
time for a retrospective of my work," he said. "I replied that I was interested 
only if I could come up with something special instead of just another 
and-then-I-wrote kind of show. 
</P>
<P>
"I put the notion aside but then woke up one morning with the idea: an 
all-female revue that salutes the female characters I have worked with, because 
the main characters in my shows are usually larger-than-life ladies. Although I 
hadn't written it when I first put 'Jerry's Girls' together, even Albin of 'La 
Cage aux Folles' is a gay man who performs in a female impersonator show." 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry's Girls" was conceived as a three-woman show with a female pianist ("I 
wanted everybody the audience saw to be female") and was first performed at a 
cabaret in New York's theater district. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out beautifully, both as a different kind of evening and as a 
showcase for my stuff," Herman said. "For the first month I came out at the end 
of each show and did 10 minutes myself, which probably helped bring in people 
who wouldn't have come to see a cast of unknown performers." 
</P>
<P>
While the show was still running in the cabaret, which it did for nearly a 
year, community theaters across the country began to perform it. Before long, 
producer Zev Bufman suggested that a larger, touring production be mounted, 
with star performers and a chorus. Leslie Uggams was the first to be cast, 
followed by Andrea McArdle, Broadway's first "Annie," by then an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The third star was a surprise even to Herman: Carol Channing, who had created 
the role of Dolly on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never dare to ask a great star like Carol to do something like that 
tour, but she said yes," he said. "The tour was a huge success, selling out 
everywhere. That was 1983, and we'd added some songs from 'La Cage,' which gave 
audiences on the tour an opportunity to hear material that hadn't been heard on 
Broadway yet." 
</P>
<P>
When Herman saw the French film comedy "La Cage aux Folles," he said, he fell 
in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It had every element I look for -- glamour, humor -- and elements that an 
audience can identify with. I also look for stories that sing to me, where I 
don't have to fight to find places to put songs in. 'La Cage' also had that 
extra crazy element that had never been on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Allan Carr had already obtained the film's stage rights and had signed 
composer-lyricist Maury Yestin and librettist Jay Presson Allen to write the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept reading other things, looking for something that would inspire me," 
Herman said. "But everything paled for me after seeing the 'La Cage' material. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost a year later I got a call from the producers, who told me that they 
were discarding what they had done and asking if I would be interested. They 
had no idea that I had been wanting to do the show since I saw the movie. The 
fact that it all came together signaled to me that I was destined to do the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
"La Cage aux Folles" broke the Palace Theater's box-office record, won Tony, 
Drama Desk and Outer Critics' Circle awards and launched productions 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still playing in Munich, and it's still playing in Brazil," Herman said. 
"Major productions, both of them. I don't think there's a country, other than 
some of the Middle Eastern countries and the Soviet Union, where it hasn't 
played successfully." 
</P>
<P>
The show has also been embraced by many members of the gay community, 
especially the song "I Am What I Am." 
</P>
<P>
"It's become almost an anthem," Herman said, "although I didn't have that in 
mind when I wrote it. I wrote it for a specific moment in the show." 
</P>
<P>
But then Herman also swears he hardly expected "Hello, Dolly!" to become a hit 
single. "I thought 'Moment by Moment' was going to be the hit from the show, 
because it was a traditional ballad," he said. "I conceived 'Hello, Dolly!' as 
an 1890s-style production number, based on a scene in an old Alice Faye movie, 
'Lillian Russell.' Louis Armstrong had the vision to turn it into a jazz song." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's version of the number, of course, became one of the biggest hits of 
1964 and doubtless contributed to the musical's lasting popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said his favorite of all his scores is the music and lyrics he wrote for 
"Mack and Mabel," his 1974 evocation of the silent movie era. 
</P>
<P>
"It's consistently my best score, and I think the show's never really found 
itself," he said. "I've been working on problems with the book for 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
Next summer Herman plans to relaunch the show in London, where it's never 
played, with a new script and British star Robert Lindsay in the part of 
producer Mack Sennett. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just about to start a new Broadway play that I can't talk about," he said, 
and there's a film in the works for the Walt Disney Co. "I see 1991 as a very 
busy year."

There's a nice little back-to-school battle heating up inside the Target store 
in Ventura . . . between sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle lunch boxes and 
sales of Chipmunk lunch boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ninja Turtles seem to be the runaway leader, but we're also having a 
revival here," store manager Kerry Baichtal said. "Alvin, Theodore and Simon -- 
they're back." 
</P>
<P>
Who or what is in third place at Target? The New Kids on the Block. But they 
are doing much better at the Oxnard K mart. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe how many kids come in here asking for them," said Tijuana 
Wade, an assistant manager. "On lunch boxes, telephones, sheets, comforters, 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Henry Fayter, the manager of the Thrifty store in Santa Paula, would 
like to be able to report any leader whatsoever in the lunch box race, but no 
such luck so far. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't selling at all," he said. "It seems over the years lunch boxes are 
selling less and less. Either children are brown-bagging it or they are buying 
lunch. It depends where you are." 
</P>
<P>
According to some guy in Michigan, Monday is officially National Boss/Employee 
Exchange Day. It's a day set aside each year for the two parties "to share each 
others' points of view." We were going to write more about this, but we were 
afraid our bosses would say no. 
</P>
<P>
Folks planning to attend the Buckwheat Zydeco performance at the Ventura 
Theater on Wednesday would be well-advised not to make the mistake of using the 
terms zydeco and Cajun interchangeably. 
</P>
<P>
"When people start saying 'Cajun' you can see Buckwheat start cringing," said 
Sandy Sawotka, the national marketing director for Island Records. "Cajun is a 
different culture. It's different music. It's different food, and Cajuns are 
white descendants of the French settlers of Nova Scotia. Buckwheat points out 
that his roots are Creole. He's proud of being Creole, proud of being black and 
proud of being French Canadian." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the musician is so concerned about this misunderstanding that his 
contract with promoters, producers and club owners states that using the word 
Cajun in promotional material is "strictly prohibited and will void" the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Buckwheat had to cancel a couple of shows at the end of last month 
because his wife was sick. She is recovering and he is expected to make the 
Ventura engagement. 
</P>
<P>
What's the most requested song on radio station KXBS these days? An updated 
version of the 1950 Don and Juan hit "What's Your Name?" with a Middle Eastern 
slant to it: 
</P>
<P>
What's your name? 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true that you're certifiably insane? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope it's been worth it 
</P>
<P>
 For your 15 minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 What's your name? 
</P>
<P>
 What's your name? 
</P>
<P>
 The song was performed by a group of Ventura County musicians, with the idea 
coming from KXBS General Manager Ed Kramph. 
</P>
<P>
"The response has been that it is very patriotic," Kramph said. "It echoes the 
feelings that county residents have. Hussein is wearing thin. I think people 
think he is basically holding the world, holding the county, hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Number two on the most-requested chart? "Unchained Melody" by the Righteous 
Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Charles and Yvonne Miles, directors of a 3-month-old organization called 
Concerned People for Animals, are trying to round up members. They've held 
introductory meetings in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, and a week from today 
will hold another meeting at the Camarillo Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many good, committed animal activists in Ventura County," Yvonne 
Miles said. "But as a county we're not seen as too active because most of the 
actual activity is in Los Angeles or Santa Barbara." LEO SMITH

WHEN IT COMES TO VALLEY PREP FOOTBALL, MUIR IS MERRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent seasons, there has been little movement at the top of the high school 
football ranks in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two seasons, perennial powers Bishop Amat High and Muir were rated 
the best teams in preseason polls. The same schools are favored again. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that, unlike the past two seasons, Muir appears to be 
leading the pack. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams might be able to settle the issue of who is the area's top team 
when they meet in a nonleague game Sept. 28 at La Canada High. For the moment, 
the Mustangs, who tied Santa Barbara for the CIF Southern Section Division II 
title last season, are favored over the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition-rich Mustangs were one of only two valley schools to win Southern 
Section titles last season. The other was Glendora, which tied Ramona for the 
Division IV championship. 
</P>
<P>
After Muir and Bishop Amat, Damien of La Verne could be the next-best area 
team. Other teams that should rank among the Valley's best include Nogales, Los 
Altos, Claremont, Wilson, Temple City, Glendora and Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at the top 10 teams: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Muir (Pacific League; Division II) -- The Mustangs were supposed to have 
one of their most talented teams ever last season, and the end result was a 
share of the Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
But as successful as last season's 11-1-2 squad was, Coach John Tyree insists 
that this team could be even better. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much more disciplined and we have a better grasp of what we're doing," 
the second-year coach said. "We've got some problems, but there's a lot more 
purpose and unity than last year." 
</P>
<P>
They might even have more talent than last year. Tyree said he expects at least 
seven players to receive major-college scholarships. "We know we have a good 
football team," he said. "We just don't know how good." 
</P>
<P>
The most heavily recruited player of the group could be defensive back Reggie 
Reser, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's defense will also include linemen Fred Sayegh (6-foot-2, 263 pounds) and 
Hank Curtis (6-1, 251), linebackers Sedrick Thomas (6-1, 215) and Jelani 
Pulliam (6-2, 210), and fleet-footed defensive backs Demetrice Martin, Hasan 
McCullough and Thad Culpepper. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs also have plenty of talent on offense, where either Martin or 
Thomas -- both run the 40 in 4.5 seconds -- will start at quarterback. Muir 
will also count on Shelton Malone (6-3, 210) at tight end, Curtis and Sayegh on 
the line, and Reser at running back. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Bishop Amat (Angelus; Division I) -- Unlike recent teams at Bishop Amat, 
there are no marquee names playing for the Lancers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the graduates from last year's team that went 8-3 were tight end Jason 
Green, who is a freshman at UCLA, and wide receiver Jeremy Smith, a freshman at 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 underclassmen expected to start, this will be one of the youngest teams 
ever at Bishop Amat. Despite the inexperience, Coach Mark Paredes has a good 
feeling about the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny thing, because on paper this team couldn't stand up to any of the 
past Bishop Amat teams," Paredes said. "But I just have a feeling that this 
team has the heart and desire to have a real good season." 
</P>
<P>
With Smith and Green gone, the offense might not have as much big-play 
potential as usual. But the Lancers have two outstanding players returning in 
quarterback Zack Zertuche and fullback Jason Patterson (6-0, 215). 
</P>
<P>
Zertuche passed for 1,675 yards and 19 touchdowns last season. Two other key 
offensive players are tackle John Ludwiczak (6-3, 230) and tight end Ealar 
Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the team might be the defense. Headliners include linebackers 
Miregi Huma, Peter Gomez, Scott Fields and Patterson -- the only senior in the 
group. "I think our linebacker corps is as good as you get," Paredes said. "A 
lot of pressure will be placed on them." 
</P>
<P>
Several other starters on defense will be tackle Nick Hanamaikai (6-0, 220) and 
defensive backs Jason Hernandez and Mike Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Damien (Baseline; Division IV) -- With 15 starters and 57 lettermen 
returning from a 7-5 squad that reached the Division IV quarterfinals, the 
Spartans have the look of a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Dick Larson is not about to be presumptuous about his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a papier-mache team," Larson said. "We think we have some good 
(players) here and we're going to do quite well. But there are still some 
things we have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
Larson shouldn't have to worry about is his defense, which has nine starters 
returning. Topping the list is All-Southern Section nose guard Mike Balian 
(6-4, 250), one of the valley's top linemen. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also returns Larry Oliver (6-2, 225) at tackle and twin brother 
Kurt (6-1, 220), at linebacker, and lineman Mark Freis, linebackers Steve 
Esquibel and Ian Moreno, and defensive backs Roman DeLeon, Angelo Antonelli, 
Nate Hernandez and Brian Roche. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few more positions to fill on offense, but the core is solid with 
the return of massive tackles Dan Holland (6-5, 250) and Cliff Sennett (6-8, 
260), center John Lewis (6-2, 215), wide receiver Jamie Gutierrez, tight end 
Basil Acree, and running backs Travis Castaldi and Jody Napuunoa. Gutierrez 
caught 27 passes for 401 yards and Acree 17 for 221 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
About the only question is who will play quarterback. Competing for the 
starting spot are seniors Tom Keller and Frank Czizinik and junior Matt 
Bechtel. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Nogales (Sierra; Division IV) -- As debuts go, Brian Beveridge's first 
year as coach of the Nobles couldn't have been more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a playoff game for the first time in school history, Nogales 
advanced to the semifinals before losing to Glendora to finish 7-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that they return 10 starters, mostly in the skill positions, there 
is cause for high expectations this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much farther ahead than we were last year," Beveridge said. "We've had a 
more complete spring (practice) and a more complete summer. I just feel much 
better about things this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Nobles could have one of the most explosive offenses in the valley with the 
return of highly regarded running back Tyrone Edwards, a senior who rushed for 
1,100 yards last season, and running back Lawrence Lanham, a junior who rushed 
for more than 1,400 yards on the junior varsity team last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two good running backs but we have to find people to block for them," 
Beveridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The line will be anchored by guard Todd Wild (5-9, 180), a three-year starter. 
Two other key offensive performers are wide receiver Fred Thompson and 
quarterback Fred Holquin. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales is more experienced on defense, particularly at linebacker with the 
return of Louis Cuevas, Marcos Alatorre and Dalyn Utley. Other starters include 
linemen Tony Verran and Joel Delgado and Edwards in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Los Altos (Sierra; Division IV) -- When it comes to producing a winning 
program, there is no team in the valley that can match the success of the 
Conquerors since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquerors have reached the playoffs 18 consecutive seasons -- the longest 
streak of any school in the Southern Section. Los Altos was 9-3 last season and 
advanced to the Division IV quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The streak does not figure to end this season, although it could be put to a 
test. With only three starters and six lettermen returning, Los Altos will have 
its most inexperienced team in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, one of the players returning is senior quarterback Mike Allen 
(6-4, 210). As a starter the last two seasons, Allen has completed 226 of 413 
passes -- a completion rate of 55.6% -- for 2,822 yards and 29 touchdowns with 
only 11 interceptions. More important, with Allen in the lineup, Los Altos is 
22-4. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Coach Dwayne DeSpain, who is closing in on the 200-win plateau with 
196-64-7 record in 23 seasons, likes what what he has seen. "We don't have 
anyone that jumps out at you except Mike," he said. "But they're hard workers 
and they're not afraid of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Allen, the offense has several players with experience, including 
tackles Joon Shin (5-9, 215) and Joe Brown (6-3, 210), wide receiver Ryan 
Lauper, tight end Ben Hernandez, and running back Brian Martinez. The defense 
will be led by lineman Steve Merchant and a strong secondary that includes 
Jason Barron, Adan Salcedo and John Yeu. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Claremont (Baseline; Division IV) -- Last season started out with great 
promise but ended in disappointment for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the season with six consecutive victories, then lost their last 
four to miss the playoffs for only the second time in the 11 seasons in which 
Bob Baiz has been coach. 
</P>
<P>
But with 12 starters returning, Claremont figures to have a happier ending this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in better shape than we were last year . . . a lot better shape," Baiz 
said. "We're a lot more experienced and we're looking for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont is particularly strong on offense, where most of its top skill 
players and linemen return. Leading the way are quarterback Adam Metwalli (6-1, 
200), running back Ryan Williams (6-1, 195), and wide receivers Ryan Wall, 
Brandy Braxton and Bill Battin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best group of receivers we've ever had," Baiz said. "We may have had 
better receivers before, but never as many." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack also has considerable experience on the offensive line with the 
return of tackle Brian Jones (6-0, 215), center Bill Lerette (6-0, 205), and 
guards Chad Ventriglia (6-3, 240) and Paul Holstrom (6-1, 225). 
</P>
<P>
There is less experience on defense, but Claremont should have an outstanding 
secondary that includes Wall, Darren Miller and Nick Baiz -- the coach's 
youngest son. The defense will also include linemen Mark Brandel and Brandon 
Griffin and linebacker Mike Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Wilson (Sierra; Division IV) -- Judging strictly by numbers, the odds 
would appear to be against the Wildcats repeating as champions of the rugged 
Sierra League. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Wildcats return only six lettermen from last season's team that 
finished 10-2 and reached the division quarterfinals. But after watching his 
team practice during the summer, Coach David Merrill is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you looked at what we had coming back, it looked dismal," he said. "But our 
kids have worked very hard all summer because they knew the challenge that was 
waiting for them." 
</P>
<P>
One of Merrill's most difficult tasks was to find a quarterback to replace his 
son, Ryan, who starred for the team last season. He might have solved that 
dilemma when his nephew, senior Tommy Merrill, transferred to Wilson from 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, who will also play safety, has an outstanding target in flanker Chris 
Hansen and an offensive line that returns tackle Ed Quesada (6-3, 250), center 
Steve Chiasson (6-4, 240), and guards Jesus Lara (5-11, 225) and Ryan Sokoda 
(6-0, 190). 
</P>
<P>
Chiasson, regarded as a major-college prospect, also anchors the defensive line 
at tackle. Among other two-way players for the Wildcats are Lara and Sokoda at 
linebacker and Hansen at safety. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Temple City (Rio Hondo; Division VII) -- Here's a quick trivia quiz: Name 
the only 11-man football program in the valley to reach the division semifinals 
in each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, of course, is Temple City. The Rams have gone 19-6-1 the last two 
years, including 9-4 in 1989, and Coach Jim Walker thinks they have an even 
better squad this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best team I've ever coached," Walker said. "It has the best 
potential. If we measure up to that potential, we can be a pretty good football 
team." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Rams could be their offense, which will feature senior 
quarterback Terry Fesler. As a junior, Fesler passed for 1,650 yards and 17 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Fesler will also have two capable passing targets in wide receiver Chris 
Gonzalez and tight end Sean Dublin (6-2, 235) and a reliable ball-carrier in 
fullback Brian Sulpizio (6-0, 205). 
</P>
<P>
The Temple City defense should also be strong as usual. The unit is paced by 
All-Division VII defensive end Matt Gilmour, a 6-5 and 220-pound senior who is 
regarded as one of the top college prospects in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also returns defensive end Greg Tandolini and all-league selections 
Bill Woodard and Joe Stampfel in the secondary. Two top newcomers are linemen 
Robert Buccola (6-3, 200) and Rocky Foltz (6-2, 195). 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Glendora (Baseline; Division IV) -- It was a dream season for the Tartans 
in 1989, when they were 12-1-1 and shared their first football championship 
with a 28-28 tie with Ramona in the Division IV final. 
</P>
<P>
It was a feat that Coach Dean Karnoski realizes will be difficult to duplicate 
this season. So he merely wants this season's squad to stand on its own 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we try to emphasize is that each team is its own team and 
each team is a separate entity," Karnoski said. "This team is an entirely 
different group, and they can be as strong as they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not entirely different. The Tartans do have nine starters returning, 
which should help Glendora remain among the best teams in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way is All-Southern Section running back Bill Zernickow, who was 
the second-leading rusher in the valley last season with 1,761 yards and 17 
touchdowns. He also caught 11 passes for 169 yards. Add fullback Bobby Baeza 
and wingback Jesse Fernandez, and Glendora has the potential of another solid 
rushing attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartans will also have one of their biggest offensive lines ever headed by 
juniors Kirk Bowman (6-4, 225) and Don Lydell (6-1, 265). The quarterback will 
be either senior Craig Palmer or junior Tracy Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora also expects to have one of its most talented defensive backfields 
ever, including all-league selection Tim Flynn and Josh Romero at safety and 
Scott Jacobsen and Fernandez at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Covina (Valle Vista; Division IV) -- In his first season as coach of the 
Colts, Dick Sheehan will have the unenviable challenge of trying to live up to 
what the team accomplished last season. 
</P>
<P>
Covina won its first Valle Vista League title and first league title of any 
kind since 1953. It also went 9-1 in the regular season before losing in the 
first round of the Division IV playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, an assistant at Charter Oak last year, is hoping that the success will 
carry over to this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very positive group of kids here," he said. "It's been a good group to 
work with. I think winning last year was a big help because winning breeds 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the top players from last season have graduated, but there are a few 
holdovers remaining who should help keep the Colts successful. Covina will 
build its offense around junior quarterback Brian Kearns, who was an all-league 
selection at wide receiver, and junior fullback Marcus Aldridge, a top middle 
linebacker as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
The offense will also feature junior tackle Keith Pollock (6-2, 205), another 
all-league selection last season, lineman Brian Linden (6-2, 220), running back 
Eddie Howard and tight end Mike Mulree. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts should be sparked on defense by linebackers Craig Pound, Mark Maybury 
and Mulree. Two other starters returning are defensive backs Tim O'Leary and 
John Suh. 
</P>
<P>
Others teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo (Mission Valley; Division V) -- Since the mid-1980s, Arroyo has had a 
firm grip on first place in the Mission Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights have won five of six league titles, including last season when they 
went 8-2 before losing in first round of the Division V playoffs to eventual 
champion Corona. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo is considered the team to beat for the league title again, although the 
position might be a little more tenuous this time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most inexperienced team I've had in a few years," Coach 
Don MacKinnon said. "Two-thirds of our roster has never played a down of 
varsity football." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for MacKinnon, Arroyo does return 10 starters from its league 
championship squad. Early in the season, the Knights will probably rely on 
their defense, which includes all-league selections Chris Jacobson (6-4, 220) 
at tackle and linebackers Keith MacLellan, Dominic Martinez and Danny Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's quarterback in its veer offense will be either Hines or MacLellan, 
whose brother, Darren, was a standout a running back at the school the last 
three seasons. Romero and Hoyt will see considerable playing time at running 
back. Jacobsen, Martinez and tackle Phillip Cruz (5-11, 230) will anchor the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park (Sierra; Division IV) -- Baldwin Park has established a winning 
tradition with its wide-open passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
But with a new quarterback and an inexperienced corps of receivers, Coach Tony 
Zane said the Braves might emphasize the run more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to play a little more grind-it-out football than we're used to," 
he said. "We'll still throw (a lot) but probably not as much as we usually do." 
</P>
<P>
The Braves, who were 6-3-1 last season, also have their biggest offensive line 
in recent years, which should make running the football easier. The line will 
include all-league tackle Peter Medrano (6-3, 245) and David Valentine (6-4, 
265), a transfer from Azusa High. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be a very big team," Zane said. "We're probably bigger than we've been 
the in the last 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the pass will cease to be a weapon for the Braves. Baldwin Park has a 
highly regarded junior quarterback, junior varsity standout Mark Ruiz, and a 
steady receiver, all-league selection Petey Limon. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the rushing chores will fall on fullback Jay Sims and tailback Chad 
Simko. The defense is headed by all-league nose guard Fernando Arredondo and 
tackles Tony Duran (6-2, 250) and Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett (Montview; Division VI) -- After the graduation of All-Southern Section 
running back Marshawn Thompson and linebacker Richard Parham, two of the top 
players in the school's history, some observers are anticipating a decline in 
success for the Olympians this season. 
</P>
<P>
That is evident in the preseason CIF Southern Section rankings, where Bassett 
is nowhere to be found. Only Coach Mark Pettengill thinks people might be 
underestimating his program. 
</P>
<P>
With a surplus of talented players from the freshman team that won back-to-back 
league titles and an excellent group of returning interior linemen, Pettengill 
thinks this squad could be better last season's 7-5 team that reached the 
Division V quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it could be our best team ever," he said. "We're excited about it. 
People still don't look our way when it comes to the CIF rankings, so we still 
have a lot to prove but we think we can prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Bassett's run-oriented offense is led by junior quarterback Tony Garcia, 
sophomore tailback Greg Moore and senior fullback Dwayne Gillison. The line 
includes center Simon Martinez (6-1, 255), guard Gus Gutierrez (5-8, 225), and 
tackles Guy Muniz (6-1, 240) and Bernie Ray (6-1, 230). 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Olympians will rely on linebackers Michael Parham, Ed Trejo and 
Abel Gutierrez, and linemen Sean Gonzalez (5-11, 200) and Benny Ramos (5-10, 
200). Parhman, a junior, is Richard's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (Pacific; Division II) -- With only one starter returning at the start 
of last season, Coach Gary Griffiths was bracing for the worst. The results 
from a 2-7-1 season were predictable. 
</P>
<P>
But with more experience returning this season, Pasadena has cause for 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have 15 to 20 kids now who have quite a lot of experience," 
Griffiths said. "It's a major difference when you have kids who have 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list is senior fullback Jhayson Hall (6-1, 230), who was the team's 
offensive leader with 934 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 123 carries. 
"He's probably as good of a running back as there is around," Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's option offense will also feature returning halfback Mario Gulley. 
Kris Kohler is expected to be the quarterback. The offense includes tackles 
Garo Dourenian (5-10, 240) and Seth Braithwaite (6-3, 250) and wide receiver 
Kevin South. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldog defense includes linebackers Curtis Banks and Thad Johnson, 
defensive end Tyrone Robinson, and LaRon Bond and South in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead (Mission Valley; Division V) -- Under Coach Jim Hall, the Panthers 
have been a regular participant in the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They finished 6-5 and reached the Southern Section playoffs last season. Hall 
said this might be his most talented squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real experienced in the skill positions," he said. "We're probably 
better off in the skill positions than we've been in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead should have one of the most potent passing attacks in the valley with 
senior receivers Chang Weisberg and Jesus Huerta. Weisberg was one of the 
leading receivers in the Southern Section with 80 catches for 811 yards, and 
Huerta was an all-league receiver as a sophomore before playing quarterback 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers also have an all-league tight end in Clint Kerr (6-2, 220) and 
junior quarterback Matt Koffler. The presence of returning running backs John 
Vigil and Pat AhHing (6-3, 255) will also help to balance the offensive attack. 
</P>
<P>
The line includes center Ray Hernandez (5-11, 175) and guard Dante Gallindo 
(6-1, 195). Rosemead will count on several two-way players on defense, 
including Hernandez and AhHing on the line, Kerr and Weisberg at linebacker, 
and Huerta at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland (Sierra; Division IV) -- The Raiders went away from their typical 
grind-it-out rushing attack and the results were disappointing. They finished 
3-7. 
</P>
<P>
So Coach Harry Robinson said his team is going back to basics this year, and 
the early prognosis for Rowland appears favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel good about it," Robinson said. "We're probably a little more 
optimistic than we've been in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
More important, the Raiders appear to have the running backs and linemen to do 
the job. Big, swift running backs David Ferguson and Damon Washington return. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland also has ample size on the line. Tackle Ronald Green (6-4, 275), a 
junior transfer from Locke High, guard Kwon Park (6-0, 205), and returning 
tight ends Casey Shaw and Ted Schell return. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders expect to be led on defense by a talented secondary that includes 
cornerbacks Frankie Rodriguez, who intercepted seven passes, and Jason Torres. 
Other defensive standouts include linebackers Clint Brunyer and Shaw and 
lineman Kurt Compton. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino (Rio Hondo; Division VII) -- Coach Bill Maloney said this will not 
be the deepest or most-experienced team the Titans have ever fielded. 
</P>
<P>
However, the results might be the same -- a challenger for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're going to be pretty good," he said. "How good depends on if we 
get the right people in the right spots. But I think we have the people." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who were 8-3 and reached the Division VII quarterfinals, have 10 
starters returning. Leading the offense will be tailback Alfonso Montoya, a 
senior who rushed for 679 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino's offense will also include quarterback Eric Walcha, tackle Greg 
Ames (6-4, 235), tight end Craig Chamberlain, and wide receivers Jeff LeSage 
and D. R. Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
With more inexperience on offense, Maloney said the team will count on its 
defense. The leaders are tackles Nate Olsen and Mark Detar, both 6-3 and 225, 
linebackers Chamberlain and Shannon Ching, and secondary standouts Montoya and 
LeSage. Olsen's father, Merlin, is an NFL Hall of Fame lineman who starred for 
the Rams.

<P>
Flip through a Thomas Guide and you will be struck by the white space between 
cities. All that land, intersected by asphalt, is a bicyclist's dream: acres of 
flower farms, rolling citrus orchards dotted with windmills and just plain, 
wide-open space. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from the experience of bicycle club members, shop owners and the county's 
Transportation Commission, here are four routes that encompass ocean, country, 
mountain and lakeside views. A considerable portion of the routes are flat or 
downhill, so there's no excuse for not dusting off your garaged bicycle. We've 
even thrown in a few rest stops. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the following route descriptions include bike paths detailed in a 
bikeway map, a first for the county, recently issued by the Transportation 
Commission. Call 642-1591 for a copy. 
</P>
<P>
Mileage for the following looped routes is given in round-trip figures. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rancho Run: 22 miles 
</P>
<P>
Rolling farmlands and citrus groves are the main attraction along this country 
loop that begins at Dos Caminos Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Park at Senan Street and Vincente Avenue in the Dos Caminos parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Vincente, left on Antonio Avenue and right on Las Posas Road, 
which will lead you to Lewis Road. As you take a left, the road immediately 
becomes Somis Road, a nice line of black asphalt that parallels the old 
Southern Pacific railroad line. You'll spot several rail yards and lumberyards 
to your right and fields of bluish-gray kale on the left. 
</P>
<P>
Within one mile on the right is Kitty's Produce, should you care to grab a 
bagful of peaches or plums. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Kitty's, turn left on North Street, which takes you through a 
residential stretch packed with front yards sprouting roses, gladioli and 
wildflower sprays. Within one mile the road curves to the right and dead-ends 
in a tractor yard at California 118. Turn left on 118, then right on Bradley 
Road for views of an idyllic countryside -- rows of orange trees stretch across 
distant, tan hills and oleander bushes hug the narrow road with bursts of red 
and white. Cars are scarce, so enjoy the quiet and don't forget to breathe in 
the sage and fennel. 
</P>
<P>
After one mile, take a left on Berylwood Road, a right on Aggen Road and a left 
on La Loma Avenue. This rolling, four-mile expanse intersects Rancho Las Posas, 
Rancho Santa Clara del Norte and Rancho Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Tired? Prop your bike against some willow trees and watch the lazy windmills 
sprouting from the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
La Loma curves left into La Vista Avenue and dead-ends at California 118. Turn 
right on 118 and follow the winding, downhill road for two miles to Wright Road 
where a lemon-yellow house smothered with hollyhocks stands on the southeast 
corner. Take a left on Wright and travel for one mile beneath a windbreak of 
ash trees, just to the left of acres of fledgling pepper plants. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Beardsley Road, which dead-ends at Central Avenue, where you'll 
take a left and ride one mile before passing over the Ventura Freeway. Take a 
left on Ventura Boulevard and a left on Las Posas Road. Pass back across the 
freeway and veer right within one-half mile (still on Las Posas) for a two-mile 
ride back to Antonio Avenue. Turn right on Antonio and right on Vincente Avenue 
and you're back at Dos Caminos Park. 
</P>
<P>
* The Inter-City Improvise: 44 miles 
</P>
<P>
If it's Monday afternoon, you must be in Montalvo. This challenging intercity 
route with excellent ocean views also takes you in or near El Rio, Camarillo, 
Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
From Camarillo's Freedom Park, head west on Pleasant Valley Road four miles 
past a lima bean farm. When Pleasant Valley intersects Pacific Coast Highway, 
jog left along Rice Avenue, then right, to pick up Pleasant Valley Road once 
again. Turn right on Rose Avenue and left on Channel Islands Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Within one-half mile on your right is Jonsons Farms (1111 E. Channel Islands 
Blvd.), a mammoth red barn packed to the rafters with crates of exotic fruit, 
local vegetables and cold drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Cycle four more miles to Channel Islands Harbor and take a right on Harbor 
Boulevard, following it along the ocean for six miles. Take a left on Peninsula 
Street (near the Ventura Freeway) and a right on Pierpont Boulevard, which will 
take you to a two-mile length of Class I bikeway that begins at San Pedro 
Street. Now may be a good time to have lunch at one of several restaurants 
along the route. The view will never be better. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the path as it turns inland for half a mile. Turn right on Main Street 
and right on Thompson Boulevard (just before Ventura Boulevard). Thompson 
curves to the left and travels for nearly three miles before veering right and 
turning into Main Street. Follow Main Steet under the Ventura Freeway and turn 
right on Arundell Avenue, which turns into a Class I bikeway for nearly one 
mile until it dead-ends at Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Harbor, left on Gonzales Road for four miles and then left on Rose 
Avenue. Pass over the Ventura Freeway and turn right on Central Avenue. Cross 
over the Ventura Freeway again, turn left on Ventura Blvd., right on Las Posas 
Road and right on Pleasant Valley Road, taking you back to Freedom Park. 
</P>
<P>
* Foster's Favorite: 27 miles 
</P>
<P>
Begin at Foster Park, just south of Ojai, for this mountain valley loop, half 
of it along a Class I bikeway and most of it with expansive views of Sulphur 
and Black mountains. 
</P>
<P>
From the park, head north along the bikeway, which skirts the Ventura River. 
Look closely, you may spot red-tailed hawks gliding just above hundreds of oak 
trees on the surrounding hills. The path ends at the eastern edge of Ojai at 
California 150, also called Ojai Avenue. Head west on Ojai Avenue toward town 
where you'll be sharing the road with Ojai's emerald-green trolley car. 
</P>
<P>
If you're ready for lunch, try the O-Hi Frostie, Home of the Hi-Burger, just 
past Blanche Street on the north side of Ojai Avenue. Don't worry, there's 
plenty of road ahead to cycle off any cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Rest your legs at the clean, aqua-colored picnic benches where a sign reads: 
"Ladies and Gentlemen do not sit or put their feet on tables." Do as you're 
told. 
</P>
<P>
Saddle up and follow Ojai Avenue west as it becomes Paseo Road. (Don't veer 
left). Turn right on Foothill Road and left on Fairview Road where miles of 
white, split-rail fences stripe the hills. The narrow road dips and rises, then 
takes a three-quarter-mile spiral plunge through the hills -- an exhilarating 
descent. Take care as you cross Maricopa Highway -- a blind curve to your left 
conceals oncoming speeding cars. 
</P>
<P>
Continue straight ahead along Fairview and turn left on Rice Road for two miles 
to California 150, also called Baldwin Road in these parts. Take a right on 150 
and a left on Burnham Road, following a curved descent among horse farms with 
such names as Rancho del Rey and God's Little Acre. Burnham turns into Santa 
Ana Road -- another downhill stretch to Casitas Vista Road. Turn left on 
Casitas Vista, which becomes Foster Park Drive, taking you back to Foster Park. 
</P>
<P>
* The Chumash Challenge: 26 miles 
</P>
<P>
This route intersects Ventura and Los Angeles counties and rounds serene Lake 
Sherwood, following the path of the Chumash Indians who lived in the area about 
700 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Begin at the Landing Shopping Center on Lindero Canyon Road in Westlake 
Village. Head south on Lindero and turn right on Triunfo Canyon Road, which 
skirts the Westlake Marina. Turn left on Westlake Boulevard, and right on 
Potrero Road into the foothills for some roller-coaster cycling past Lake 
Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
Past the lake, Potrero Road offers some expansive views on your right, and, on 
your left, sprawling country manors with such names as Boxfield Riding Stables, 
Brookfield Farms and Howlett's Valley Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Look for an Arabian horse ranch on your left (formerly owned by Sylvester 
Stallone) as you round a wide right curve eight miles into the ride. Turn right 
on Wendy Drive in Thousand Oaks and right on Lynn Road, a wide ribbon of 
asphalt that will take you four miles past more horse ranches and country 
vistas. Pass over the Ventura Freeway, take a right on Hillcrest Drive and look 
for the Class I bikeway that curves around The Oaks and Janss Mall. The bikeway 
will lead you to Moorpark Road. Turn right on Moorpark and left on Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
About three miles up on the left, just before Duesenberg Drive, drop into 
Pancho's Mexican Restaurant for food prepared by Kim Pancho -- the Chinese chef 
and owner. He recommends the chile relleno for $5.29 and a glass of cold Tecate 
enjoyed on the shaded patio. 
</P>
<P>
Saddle your mechanical steed and continue down Thousand Oaks Boulevard to 
Lindero Canyon Road. Take a right and continue south to the Landing Shopping 
Center.

TELLING A TALL FAIRY TALE; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE VENTURA COUNTY REPERTORY THEATRE VERSION, THE MAGIC WAND IS A BANANA IN 
A HOLSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cinderella's fairy godmother lifts her magic wand to transform the wretched 
maiden's broom into six white horses. 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- that's not a wand. It's a banana she's drawn from a holster at her 
side. With her cowgirl hat and leather fringed vest, this fairy godmother looks 
like Annie Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
"Now bring me a pumpkin," the frontier fairy drawls, opening her little black 
book. "And some salt, cinnamon and chocolate. Oh no, no. That's my recipe for 
magic cake." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the Cinderella children have been fed for years. This one has a 
no-nonsense fairy godmother who says things like "hogwash." But the Ventura 
County Repertory Theatre had promised a Cinderella "as you've never seen it 
before." 
</P>
<P>
The spoof is the group's current offering for children at its new home, 
Theatre-By-The-Sea at Ventura Harbor Village. 
</P>
<P>
It's an intimate theater, with 65 seats facing the stage on three sides. Don't 
look for elaborate sets. There are none, and few props. Yet nearly every seat 
was taken on a recent Saturday by parents, grandparents and young children. 
</P>
<P>
The children were swept into the play by the all-adult cast. 
</P>
<P>
When Cinderella needs a dress for the ball, the children close their eyes, make 
a wish and count to 20. Like magic, Cinderella appears dressed to the hilt. 
But, hold it, she's barefoot. So they count to three, and in a sleight of foot, 
Cinderella lifts her dress and shows off her satin pumps. 
</P>
<P>
The children are invited to dance at the ball. When the stepsisters are vainly 
trying on the shoe, they try it on as well. 
</P>
<P>
The stepsisters aren't just mean and ugly. One of them, Stacy, is a gum-popping 
space case with one missing high-top sneaker. She says things like, "I'm so 
like excited." 
</P>
<P>
Another, named Heather, scratches herself and snorts like a pig when she 
laughs. And the third, Tracy, dressed in orange cowboy boots and a black boa, 
does little but stare vacantly with her mouth open. 
</P>
<P>
The wicked stepmother roars at Cinderella with such malice that one child burst 
into tears. "Here, fix this!" she says, yanking off her ill-fitting wig. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is more tangled than shoe meets foot. Cinderella falls for the 
footman, the prince in disguise. He tests her genuineness with some not so 
tricky questions, and it all ends happily. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Ann Mackenzie of Santa Barbara, the show is sometimes over the heads 
of the children. That's deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been looking for something that appeals to children and adults," said 
Helen Jordan, who plays a stepsister. "If it's just for kids, the parents are 
there going ho-hum." 
</P>
<P>
The group was formed 10 years ago by Elizabeth Harris. It moved into the 
theater in February with its first adult production. In July it began staging 
"Cinderella." 
</P>
<P>
The cast is all volunteer. Some are rookies, like K.C. Marie, a Ventura College 
student who plays the stepmother with wit and wickedness. Roger Berry, the 
prince, and Susan Wiltfang, another stepsister, also are students there. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been in local drama for 10 years. She teaches eighth-graders U.S. 
history, English and drama. Joanne Goertz, the fairy godmother, is a secretary 
by day, as is another stepsister, Denise Lee. Karl Thomas, who plays the Duke, 
is a retired entertainer who performed in "The Drunkard" for 18 years in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Maxwell, a professional magician, does a Cinderella sweeter than a 
Twinkie. After the show, children crowded around her for hugs. 
</P>
<P>
The theater offers another children's show for free at 10 a.m. on Saturdays. 
Jimmy D sings songs with some help from the children in the audience. He also 
brings along Miss Pinky, a pink hippopotamus outfitted in a blue tutu, ballet 
slippers and a bikini top. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Cinderella" is having an indefinite run Saturdays at 11:30 
a.m. and 1:30 p.m. at Theatre-By-The-Sea, Ventura Harbor Village, 1559 
Spinnaker Drive, Ventura. Tickets are $4. Advance tickets, 655-7688. Jimmy D 
sings children's songs at 10 a.m. Saturdays in the theater. There is no charge.

ANGLERS FIND THAT BONITO ACTION IS HEATING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big bonito provided anglers aboard Redondo Sportfishing's fleet plenty of 
action over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Dan Armstrong said that schools of bait fish at rocky point helped 
lure bonito into the area. The bonito weighed up to eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the yellowtail bite slowed due to the heavy holiday traffic. 
Bonito have accounted for the daily 10-fish limit. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun returned Monday from a two-day albacore trip. 
Only 10 albacore were landed along with 15 skipjack and four dorado. Steve Oba 
of West Los Angeles won the jackpot with his 20-pound albacore. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Johnson of Torrance caught a 22-pound yellowtail and lost one of the 
jackpots to a dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The half-day boat Matt Walsh from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing was fishing outside 
the horseshoe kelp area when a marlin jumped near the stern of the 65-foot 
sportfisher. Felix Cowall of San Pedro had a small mackerel on his hook and 
made a cast toward the area where the marlin had jumped. 
</P>
<P>
Cowall had a strike and a marlin peeled all his 30-pound test line. Capt. Ray 
Duane moved the boat with fighting fish. 
</P>
<P>
Cowall was unable to gain any line, and after 15 minutes, his line snapped. 
Duane estimated the fish to be in excess of 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Giant squid have invaded an area three miles out from Point Fermin. The live 
bait boat Chovey Clipper, which supplies anchovies to the South Bay 
Sportfishing fleet, was preparing to make a set for bait when giant squid came 
up to the boat's floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Bill Verner and his crew were able to scoop up four squid, which were 
placed in the bait well. 
</P>
<P>
A call was made to Larry Fukuhara at the Cabrillo Museum who had the squid 
transferred to the museum's holding tanks. Fukuhara said that one squid on 
display is 15 pounds and 14 1/2 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Information: Cabrillo Museum (213) 548-7562 
</P>
<P>
Benny Marsh of Wilmington was fishing for bonito from his 20-foot skiff near 
Portugese Bend and snagged a giant squid. He said it was about eight-feet long 
and weighed 11 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven marlin were weighed in during the weekend at Avalon's scale. Brian Rapf, 
7, of Malibu caught his first marlin and it took him only 25 minutes to land 
it. It weighed 139 pounds. 
</P>
<P>

tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week, a 48-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Rubinson of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina aboard the Toronado, caught 
a 30-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Torres of Torrance, fishing aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 26-pound

</P>
<P>
Tom Moon of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Aquaris, caught a 25-pound white

FAMILY CAR POOL AFFORDS A LESSON IN MODERN SOCIAL STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maureen Brown, Maureen Brown is a writer and mother of four. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hello," says the gentle voice on the phone, "I'm calling to see whether you'd 
be interested in organizing transportation for school, choir practice, 
orchestra, football and/or soccer practice." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than approach the forthcoming school year and its related driving with 
disdain and trepidation, I am fortified. The van's brakes have been recently 
checked, the oil has been changed, and a good portion of last year's grime has 
been cleaned off the seats. 
</P>
<P>
And I expect another season of examining the social phenomenon called the car 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
My introduction to sociology was through the semester study of a tribal group 
in Timbuktu (of which my college freshman professor had written a complete 
text). I spent hours reading of this tribal group's behavior patterns and 
paralleling them to theories of sociology. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, I have conducted an informal study of the family car pool based 
on a postulate that the car pool is a social structure in itself. 
</P>
<P>
My analysis is based on years of interacting with numerous same-sex and 
coeducational groups of children that I have transported. Whereas some social 
groups are brought together because of geography, employment or other 
demographics, the family car pool is initiated by primary contact of two or 
more adults to "share the burden." 
</P>
<P>
I cultivate my car pools selectively. I once received a phone call from an 
individual that commenced as a breathless run-on sentence. "Hello, I've been 
told that you aren't anxious to be in another car pool, but, I can assure you 
that I am extremely organized, my son Jeffrey is very cooperative, I am always 
always prompt, a very cautious driver who always insists that seat belts be 
worn, moreover, I'm pregnant and would even drive more than my share for the 
opportunity of having someone to share the driving in the coming months." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in car pools are not always diligent. I have, at times, lamented 
the general lack of references available on the other drivers with whom I am 
about to enter into this cooperative effort. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone can relate to the car pool nightmare of your child calling the office 
or home and reporting that "the ride is not here." It takes only one time of 
comforting a frightened eight-year old clutching her cello on a dark corner at 
7 o'clock in the evening to know that Mrs. X needs to inform you, and your 
Child E, that Mr. Y will be the designated driver at Point Q rather than Ms. Z. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of a car pool is organization. 
</P>
<P>
If one can overcome the scheduling obstacles of the car pool, a most 
pleasurable adventure can be gained in the unobtrusive observation of the 
social nature of the young group. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, one can scrutinize an immediate identifiable characteristic of the 
social order or stratification of the assembly. In some circles, this is 
commonly known as the pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
Show me a car pool for 10 minutes and I will classify the leader, the 
followers, and the weakest member. I have attempted to negate this hierarchy 
from every car pool I have driven, and yet, it surfaces with predictability. 
Noticeable attributes of the so-called leaders are their snide remarks 
following comments by other riders, their need to always sit by a window or a 
certain individual and a basic desire to control. 
</P>
<P>
In sports car pools, the dominant role normally is assumed by the most 
promising player. Unfortunately, the weakest player has a tendency to delegate 
himself to whatever seat is left. Occasionally, the social structure can shift 
when the weaker player has a tremendous game and his placement within the group 
is modified for that period. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestral car pools, regardless of the musical ability of individual members, 
are invariably dominated by the string players. Woodwinds, brass, and 
percussionists take a passive role. 
</P>
<P>
Other variables alter the social pattern of the car pool. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the major mathematic examination, that student who has excelled 
throughout the term is most revered. He usurps this authoritative guise while 
being sought for answers to unsolved arithmetic problems. Thus, the status of 
members is temporarily shifted when individuals of the car pool distinguish 
themselves with information of necessity for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Manners of dress, or conformity, such as found in tribal groups, also can be 
noted in car pools. 
</P>
<P>
If you question the mode of dress of your child, you are most likely to detect 
similar fashion on other constituents of the car pool. If the baggy, 
ill-fitting outfit is received by a compliment from any member of the car pool, 
it is an omen that the look will reappear with frequency. 
</P>
<P>
As with clan behavior, language has a definite role in the behavior patterns of 
the group. Should one child adopt a new phrase or term, i.e. "Don't have a cow, 
man," "gnarly," or "bogus," this terminology begins to be repeated with 
frequency on subsequent trips. One car pool of memory embraced the usage of 
"like" to launch most sentences for a period of an entire year. 
</P>
<P>
As noted in all social interaction, two other cultural and basic needs 
influence a car pool -- food and music. 
</P>
<P>
If one is tolerant of the consumption of food in the automobile, you will 
observe that most children under 8 years of age perform odd maneuvers with 
fruit rolls, straws, and bananas and that diet drinks and chips are a staple of 
most adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the need for music is paramount in any social interaction, I confess 
that I cannot abide this craving. Ten minutes in rush-hour traffic with music 
with a resounding low-bass cadence and unintelligible words has a negative 
effect on me. I, therefore, select the music. 
</P>
<P>
The last identifiable cultural feature of the car pool relates to the subtle 
interval when the driver's proficiency is critiqued by the constituents of the 
car pool. References to "incomplete stop," "should have made that light," and 
"shifts poorly" indicate that the members of the group are embarking on a new 
frontier in their cultural maturation -- driver's education. 
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable feature of this rite de passage is that it signals that the 
group will soon no longer be dependent on you. Your primary function with the 
clique will be terminated when one of them receives a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's up to them to drive this social phenomenon.

A VERITABLE FEAST OF ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS;

<P>
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL PRODUCE

<P>
One sells ostrich eggs while another tantalizes passers-by with live Maine 
lobster. 
</P>
<P>
One hawks gourmet vegetables to the rich and famous throughout Southern 
California, while another practically gives away whatever produce its owner, a 
happy retiree, feels like picking that day -- if he feels like picking at all. 
</P>
<P>
Still another offers to repair your shoes while you browse among the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the, well, unusual, these are North County's roadside 
stands. Where the countryside beckons from ubiquitous orange and green signs. 
Where freshness can sometimes be measured in hours, not days or weeks. Where 
you can get to know the people behind the produce. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the roadside stand thing is getting popular because it's good for both 
the farmer and the customer," says Mike Hillebrecht, who, with his sisters and 
parents, runs and supplies The Farm Stand off San Pasqual Valley Road on the 
way to the Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers get better quality -- at least fresher than grocery stores. Plus, 
people like to get a little drive out in the country. But you gotta sell good 
stuff or they won't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Produce stands run the gamut, from open-air shacks that loyal customers have 
frequented for decades to corn-filled trucks you flag down. Some stands attract 
their clientele with exotic arrays of Mother Earth's bounty. Things like purple 
"green beans," golden or striped beets, yellow cherry tomatoes, countless 
varieties of squash and lettuce and Israeli breakfast melons. 
</P>
<P>
Others rely on good locations, such as the stands on the way to the Wild Animal 
Park. Echigo Farms, at California 78 and San Pasqual Road, relies on that 
traffic for its consistent crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Still other stands count on that one scrumptious product to inspire such fierce 
loyalty among its tasters that they will drive miles to buy it. Every stand 
wants a customer like Ray Anderson, 60, who drives from Escondido to Fallbrook 
nearly twice a week. His wife, it seems, has a hankering for strawberries from 
Uchimura Farms, known as the "Airport Strawberry Stand," for its proximity to 
the Fallbrook Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place we'll buy strawberries," says Anderson, an equipment 
operator who worked in Fallbrook years ago. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, freshness is the biggest draw to roadside stands, customers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to have fresh vegetables," says You Young, who helps his father 
with the family farm in Fallbrook while on summer break from college. 
</P>
<P>
You's commitment to freshness is so strong that when friends and customers 
suggested putting a stand in front of their Oriental vegetable farm on Mission 
Road, he nixed the idea. Instead, he put a sign up notifying customers what 
produce is available. They drive in, tell You or his father what they want, and 
wait while the two men pull the vegetables from the ground, wash and bag them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I (put in a stand) and pick it all in the morning, it's not that fresh," 
You says. "So why don't you come in and wait 15 minutes?" 
</P>
<P>
La Costa resident Tricia Cerda says freshness, whether the produce is picked 
that moment or that day, makes a world of difference to the taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's picked when it's ready to eat, so it tastes so much better," says Cerda, 
who stops at Gourmet Gardens in San Marcos whenever she visits a friend in 
Fallbrook. "In the supermarkets, who knows how long it's been in storage. With 
this, you know it's fresh, and that's the No. 1 thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet Gardens picks daily from the family-operated farm directly behind the 
stand on Sycamore Drive, says Mary Borevitz, who runs the family stand. When 
they sell out, that's it for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Borevitzes don't sell anything they don't grow, and that's the way it's 
supposed to work for those with "free farmer" permits from the Consumer Food 
Protection division of the county Department of Health Services, Environmental 
Health Services. That's the designation of most roadside stands, says Tim 
Tillyer, North County district supervisor. Others buy permits from the county 
that allow them to sell goods grown by other farmers. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of stands with "free farmer" designation (meaning their permits 
cost nothing) sell more than their own produce, Tillyer says. The clerk at one 
stand, for example, boasted about the asparagus from Walla Walla, Wash., while 
others offer bananas with stickers from Latin America and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"The public health concern is we don't have an idea of where the produce has 
come from, and we don't know who has handled it or how," Tillyer says. 
</P>
<P>
The produce could come from back yards sprayed with excessive doses of 
pesticides; it could come from Mexico or Arizona and carry fruit flies; it 
could have been handled in an unclean way or near sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be good, or it might not be," he says. "We don't have a way of 
knowing. And that's our biggest problem." 
</P>
<P>
On their inspection rounds, Tillyer and his inspectors have discovered some of 
the more unusual offerings at North County's roadside stands. For example, 
you'll find Girl Scout cookies out of season at Valley Produce in the 3400 
block of East Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Perrydise Farms, 1920 S. El Camino Real, used to offer live Maine lobster every 
weekend to go with its assortment of vegetables and fruits. But proprietor Dave 
Perry said the arrangement became too burdensome and took away from the farm 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what we were doing," he says. "We're farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Once, overestimating his market, he ordered 200 lobsters. Only half of them 
sold. "We got tired of eating them," he says. "We had to throw a party just to 
get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
But Perrydise Farms still will special order from Maine for customers who 
request it. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're the efficient type who likes one-stop shopping, take a trip to 
Veltri Shoe Repair and Fruit Stand in Valley Center. You can even get keys made 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad retired from (the shoe repair business in) Orange County 20 years ago," 
says Carmine Veltri. It just so happened that the land onto which he moved his 
house and all his shoe repair equipment came with 11 acres of orange trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 20 years, we've planted all kinds of trees. So it basically evolved into 
a fruit stand." 
</P>
<P>
The prize for most unusual roadside stand would have to go to the San Diego 
Ostrich Farm's stand off San Pasqual Road on the way to the Wild Animal Park. 
As you drive into the stand, ostriches on either side of the road gather to 
look at you curiously. Don't get too friendly with these birds, though. Signs 
all around warn: "Beware, we bite." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, you'll find, among other things, arrays of plain and painted ostrich 
eggshells. They're about 7 inches high with exteriors as tough and brittle as 
ceramic. Owners Margaret and Phil Sargent enjoy plying their customers with fun 
facts about the huge birds. 
</P>
<P>
For example: one ostrich egg is equivalent to two dozen chicken eggs, though at 
$30, it costs 10 times as much; an ostrich will lay about 100 eggs a year, with 
about a 50 % survival rate; males and females take turns sitting on the egg; 
and, soft boiling one ostrich egg would take an hour, plus you need an ax to 
open it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sargents also will tell you that before too long, ostrich meat will rival 
beef. Ostriches, the largest birds in the world, aren't endangered, and they 
breed rapidly, Margaret says. The meat is soft, tender and red like a filet, 
and it's low in cholesterol and fat. "They're going to be farmed like cattle," 
she predicts. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not ready for ostrich omelets or bird beef, you can always purchase 
ostrich plume pens, feather dusters, $300 ostrich skin purses or feather boas. 
</P>
<P>
Then you can wear them to the swankest roadside stand in the county: The 
Vegetable Shop, known simply as "Chino's." 
</P>
<P>
Located in an unassuming mustard-colored shed outside of Rancho Santa Fe (at 
Via de Santa Fe and Calzada del Bosque), Chino's has been a household name 
among the well to do since 1969. On any given morning, a consistent flow of 
Mercedes, Jaguars and the occasional Rolls Royce line up to select from gourmet 
vegetables plucked that very morning from the fields beyond the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gourmet Gardens in San Marcos, Chino's is constantly trying new varieties 
of vegetables. This year, for example, the farm will produce more than 20 
varieties of lettuce. Customers sometimes even bring seeds for the farm to try 
out. Gil Smith, a 68-year-old designer from Rancho Santa Fe, once brought a 
seed from a large Italian pepper that he tasted and loved in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a lot of special stuff once in a while that you can't find anywhere 
else," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants such as the star-studded Spago's in Los Angeles and others also buy 
from Chino's. 
</P>
<P>
Success, however, has forced the family to cut back on some of its intimacy. 
One Rancho Santa Fe regular remembered a time when he and other longtime 
customers received a Christmas gift package with homemade jams, pickles and 
other goodies. There's just no time for that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Time is one commodity (Grandpa) Bob Edwards has aplenty. And the 63-year-old 
proprietor of Grandpa's Organic Grown roadside stand in Vista is not about to 
let go of it. 
</P>
<P>
He raises crops on the 2 acres surrounding his Vista home, selling only what he 
and his wife don't eat. There's no telling what you'll find on any given day. 
Could be rhubarb, or okra, or lima beans or giant sweet onions. 
</P>
<P>
To "make math easy" and get around the need for a government-certified scale, 
Edwards packages his vegetables into $1 bags. The bags go out onto a small, 
shaded cart outside his house on Monte Vista Road. He trusts his customers to 
abide by the honor system and deposit their money into the slot marked "Pay 
here. Thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edwards enjoys his retirement from a tattered chair in his cluttered 
garage within eyesight of the stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I put it out when I feel like it, and I take it in when I feel like it," says 
Edwards, who sports ragged red suspenders and a belt with a huge buckle made of 
buffalo nickels. "Sometimes I leave it out all night when I forget." 
</P>
<P>
Those nights are the only times Edwards has been stiffed. Of course, he does 
get a few IOUs and other strange forms of payment. Like food stamps, or the 
note last year from someone who signed "Love, Stacey." 
</P>
<P>
"Here is 5,000 pesos," Edwards reads from the note, which he has tacked to the 
bulletin board in his garage. "It's all that I have, but it's worth a little 
over $2.50 in American dollars. Here is also a cartoon for your refrigerator. 
Thank you!" Business certainly isn't brisk at Grandpa's Organic Grown. Nor is 
it at the majority of North County vegetable stands. Edwards has pondered the 
reasons and thinks he knows why more people don't take advantage of the 
freshness available at stands. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace is too fast," he says. "It's more convenient to go to a (grocery 
store) produce counter. This is a little more trouble for some to drive around 
and get what they're after." 
</P>
<P>
But if freshness, down-home hospitality and perhaps a drive in the country is 
what you're after, North County's roadside stands are waiting for you.

VISTA SCHOOLS SCRAMBLE TO HOUSE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in four years, the doors of a new school will not be opening 
in the Vista Unified School District this September. 
</P>
<P>
However, Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Townsend says the district does hope to have an elementary school open 
next fall to accommodate Vista's growing school-age population. 
</P>
<P>
The district opened five schools in the last four years -- two in 1987, two in 
1988 and one in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to the San Diego County Office of Education, district enrollment has 
grown 40% in that time, from 12,512 in 1986-1987 to 17,520 last year. 
</P>
<P>
This year's break from school openings "wasn't a total breather," Townsend 
said. "We changed our whole calendar to accommodate growth." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only reason the district is not opening a new school this year is 
that it did not have the money to do so, Townsend says. As a result, Vista kids 
now attend school in one of three, year-round calendar tracks.

organized broadly and encompass kindergarten through 12th grade. Some 
communities maintain separate elementary and high school districts. 
Additionally, some districts have combined at the high school level.

PUTTING DOWN ROOTS AROUND A RESORT 
</P>

Nestled behind tranquil Batiquitos Lagoon, the community of La Costa fills the 
valley floor of San Marcos Creek and clings to its lush canyon walls. Newer 
sections perch atop the rolling hills that surround the canyon, 38 miles north 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Born as a vacation condo development that merely accompanied the glamorous, 
occasionally-notorious La Costa Hotel and Spa of 1970, the 
'nice-place-to-visit-but' has bloomed into a nice place to put down roots for 
more than 16,000 permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
Stretched white limousines bearing beautiful, tanned people are yawningly 
common sights at the corner of El Camino Real and Costa del Mar Road. But along 
La Costa's twining, manicured byways, you'll see more yard sales, dog walkers 
and station wagons packed with Little Leaguers than ever before. The La Costa 
Avenue exit off Interstate 5 leads not only to the fabled spa, but also to the 
fastest growing "Park and Ride" commuter station in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"La Costa is actually part of Carlsbad," said Anne Kulchin, a La Costa resident 
and Carlsbad city council member. "But we can have it either way. If we want to 
impress people in big cities back East, we say we live at La Costa, and they 
'know' about the spa. It's the San Diegans who have to ask, 'Where is that in 
relation to Carlsbad?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's south. La Costa became the southwest corner of Carlsbad's city limit (see 
map) when it annexed itself to Carlsbad in 1972. Olivenhain Road and El Camino 
Real loosely mark the community's south and west sides, and much of the land 
accessible off both sides of Rancho Santa Fe Road between Olivenhain and San 
Marcos is also part of La Costa. But its northern boundary runs somewhere north 
of and parallel to Alga Road, but not as far north as Palomar Airport Road. 
</P>
<P>
Driving by on I-5, visitors first notice Batiquitos Lagoon. If the ocean tide 
is high, the lagoon shimmers. If it's low, marshy cat tails appear to shrink 
the shallow shoreline. When fog lays heavy on the tranquil waters, you might 
imagine Indians of the Luiseno tribes who lived here and gathered shellfish 
from the lagoon. Although Batiquitos Lagoon was mentioned in early Spanish land 
grants, it never was part of the original La Costa Hotel and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood celebrities of the late '60s favored this European-style spa over the 
many desert resorts, perhaps because it was just down the coast. Wealthy guests 
soon wanted vacation bungalows of their own, and as the number of spa employees 
grew, they needed housing too. So the Las Vegas-based La Costa Land company 
began offering residences with vacation flavor. All that glamour and profit 
soon attracted bigger bucks and swifter development. In the '80s, local 
headlines hinted of mob financing and high-rollers, but ironically, what 
emerged was an image of La Costa as a lifestyle: flashy yet attainable. 
</P>
<P>
And attain they do. Today, the average La Costa resident is 35 years old and 
earns more than $50,000 per year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments. "We think of the spa as a good neighbor," says 
Sandra Gilkin, buying flowers from a corner vendor. "We eat there quite often, 
and my husband likes their golf course. But the resort isn't the only thing 
there is in La Costa," Gilkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Within their locale, La Costans support a dozen restaurants, four shopping 
centers, two public schools, a public library, four public parks with ambitious 
cultural and recreational programs, and a church. Developers promise another 
church site, two more schools, and another recreation center complete with a 
day-care facility and swimming pool. La Costans already enjoy their own 
historic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Just off Rancho Santa Fe Road, visitors can see five crumbling adobe walls 
protected from the elements (and from souvenir-hungry tourists) beneath a 
sturdy shelter. This humble ruin is all that remains of a "way station" on the 
J.S. Mannasse ranch, part of the Butterfield Stagecoach Line of the 1860s. 
Adventurous travelers sought comfort here from their two-day horse-drawn coach 
ride between San Diego's Franklin Hotel and points in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Stagecoach Park, built around the ruin, offers a lavish array of comforts 
for young and older La Costans: summer jazz and pop music concerts, jazzy 
aerobic workouts, self-guided bicycle tours of art exhibits in the park, 
volleyball, ballet and, of course, Little League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
A modern sculptural rendition of the historic walls flanks the park's grassy 
slopes. These newer walls invite La Costa's children to scramble up their 
gentle sides, to sit on top awhile and ponder a nearby sliver of riparian 
wilderness preserve that borders Stagecoach Park. 
</P>
<P>
Limousine-drawn guests of the La Costa Resort roll by the yard sales and dog 
walkers, each attaining comfort in their own way. And along I-5, when the fog 
rolls in over the lagoon, the spirits of Indians reaffirm that La Costa is a 
nice place to live, and to visit.

</P>
<P>
Because of the natural arena-like characteristics of the La Jolla Cove, 
spectators have a good view of all the events. An awards ceremony follows the 
competition.

DEL MAR'S SOCIAL CLIMATE HEATS UP; 
</P>
<P>
UNCOOL IN MIDST OF NEW HOT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS, Kevin Brass writes about media issues for The Times and is a 
former associate editor of the Del Mar Citizen. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing can make a person feel less cool and less hip these days than a 
conversation with someone from Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you been to Johnny Rockets yet?" a friend asked me recently, obviously 
attempting to gauge my hipness. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to appear unsophisticated, I replied, "Uh, no." 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" he said, barely disguising his contempt. "Look, ya gotta go. As I 
understand it, they opened one in Beverly Hills and it was a smash, and now 
they've opened one here." 
</P>
<P>
Already having shown myself to be one step above the sea slug in hipness, I saw 
no reason not to press on. 
</P>
<P>
"What exactly is Johnny Rockets?" I asked, forever dooming myself to a 
purgatory of the uncool in the eyes of my friend. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the tone of a teacher instructing a 4-year-old, he revealed that 
Johnny Rockets is THE place to be these days. The way he described it, it 
sounded like a very chic hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in Del Mar. And it is HOT, in the same way Hula Hoops were once hot. 
</P>
<P>
Having found out long ago that I was not high on the hipness scale -- I think 
it first occurred to me the day I wore my basketball shoes and shorts to the 
opening of an art gallery -- I was not too bothered by my unawareness of the 
latest hot spot. It hurt, though, to learn it was in Del Mar, and I knew 
nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Del Mar, or at least I spent what Dr. Ruth likes to refer to as my 
"formative years" in Del Mar. I consider it my home, even though I traitorously 
moved to Ocean Beach recently. 
</P>
<P>
I still visit often enough, though, to think I know what's happening in my 
hometown. Apparently I don't. 
</P>
<P>
A few nights after my conversation about Johnny Rockets, I was once again 
confronted with my clear lack of awareness of the hip Del Mar scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the crowd at the J. J. Maguire's," a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Once again I had to admit that I knew nothing about the place. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's where the G.R.B. used to be," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, now we're talking local talk. The G.R.B. used to be a restaurant on 15th 
Street. It was there that, in 1976, I drank too much wine and made up large 
portions of the Declaration of Independence while posing as Thomas Jefferson in 
a presentation to the Del Mar Bicentennial Committee. Although it has been many 
restaurants since then, many locals still refer to it as the G.R.B. (which I 
believe stood for Golden Rolling Belly). 
</P>
<P>
But I had never heard of J.J. Maguire's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the totally young and hip college crowd," my friend said. "They have one 
of those singing machines. All the well-dressed college dudes and babes go 
there. It's always packed." 
</P>
<P>
This was something of a shock to me. The cool dudes and babes never hung out in 
Del Mar before. Del Mar is where they bought beer and later went to a cool club 
somewhere else (usually in Palm Springs). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this whole concept of Del Mar being the hot spot of North County is a 
little unsettling for me. I know Del Mar has changed. I've walked the streets 
enough to see the difference. Since the new "European-style" Del Mar Plaza and 
the Del Mar Inn across the street opened, it seems the sidewalks are always 
crowded with tourists and shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
This shouldn't be a big surprise. No one believed the developers of the Plaza 
and the Inn when they stressed over and over again that their facilities would 
be geared only toward the residents of Del Mar. (Well, most people didn't 
believe them.) 
</P>
<P>
But nobody told us Del Mar was going to be HOT. As much as I can understand and 
accept the new Del Mar, it's hard to fathom it as a happening spot, a bastion 
of the gold and Gucci crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But it's undeniable. There is a buzz in this little village, a chic aura that 
didn't exist before. Everyone is always talking about this restaurant or that 
cool new shop. At night, I've discovered, the restaurants and bars are full of 
the society people described in Tom Wolfe's "Bonfires of the Vanities," the 
skinny women in skin-tight outfits he labeled "X-rays" and the well-dressed men 
who represent the style-conscious side of society, the folks who might open a 
conversation with, "Excuse me, what kind of mousse do you use?" 
</P>
<P>
This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely new and different for 
Del Mar, which always had a far funkier aura, at least in my mind. The 
community met over coffee at Del Mar Danish at 9 a.m., not over Champagne 
cocktails at Il Fornaio. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it's only fair to note that, in many ways, the essence of 
the village -- the laid-back nature of the people who live there -- hasn't 
changed much. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everything important (about Del Mar) has remained the same," Herb 
Benham, an annual visitor to Del Mar, wrote in a recent column for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
He's right, and it's an important point. The heart and soul of the community, 
its status as a special part of the world, has remained unharmed, primarily 
because of the beaches and the people -- the folks at the library, the young 
girls working at Carlos and Annie's, the bartenders at Bully's. 
</P>
<P>
But the trappings of the community have gone through a drastic transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar has always been a hangout for the rich and carefree, but until recently 
it was never compared to Rodeo Drive. The Hollywood crowd has been part of the 
fabric of the community, but they came to Del Mar to escape, not to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Being seen in Del Mar is extremely cool these days -- as long as you're wearing 
the right sunglasses.

FOR OPENERS, ROLLING HILLS WILL BATTLE MARY STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 South Bay high school football season opens tonight when Rolling Hills 
High plays Mary Star at 7:30 at Daniels Field in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills senior quarterback Bill DeMucci, who started the 1989 season 
opener, will try to keep the job longer this time around. 
</P>
<P>
DeMucci was injured in practice after the Titans' fourth game and replaced by 
Greg Schwartz, who finished the 6-3-1 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, coached by Gary Kimbrell, feature highly touted running back with 
Robert Coulter, who was ranked 15th in state rushing last season with 1,545 
yards. He averaged 7.6 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Only two returning players in the state had more yards than Coulter, who 
presents a big challenge for the Mary Star defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars are led by four two-way veterans who earned All-Santa Fe League 
honors as juniors: tight end-defensive lineman Brian Bologna, wide 
receiver-defensive back J. R. Javier, lineman Mark Ponce De Leon and running 
back-defensive back Matt Redlew. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of Coach Mike Marinkovich's team is its secondary. Javier, Redlew 
and David Bozanich combined for 21 interceptions last season, helping Mary Star 
to a 7-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of Mary Star's 24 players are seniors. Several of the players have 
competed together since elementary school DAVID RAATZ

KOH ADDED TO BASEBALL STAFF AT PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Koh has resigned as baseball coach at L. A. Baptist after one season and 
will join the Pierce College staff as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement at L. A. Baptist is Mark Bates, the school's football coach and 
last season's junior varsity baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Koh, an L. A. Baptist graduate, led the Knights to a 2-15 record and a 
last-place, 1-9 finish in the Alpha League. He will be reunited with Pierce 
co-Coach Bob Lofrano. Koh assisted Lofrano when the two coached at Chatsworth 
High. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew when Joe took the job that he wanted to move to the college level," L. 
A. Baptist Athletic Director Maury Neville said Wednesday. "We thought we'd 
have him longer and we wish we could still have him, but this is a step up for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Bates, 24, is in his third year at L. A. Baptist and his second as the football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
He also served for two years as the junior varsity baseball coach and teaches 
math at the private school in Sepulveda, which has an enrollment of 460.

DIGEST: EAST L.A. HIRES LOHR-CRUZ TO COACH CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gretchen Lohr-Cruz, an All-American in track and cross-country at Cal State Los 
Angeles and a former Valley College standout, has been named women's 
cross-country coach at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Cruz, 30, placed fourth in the 1989 Los Angeles Marathon and finished 
sixth in the 10,000 meters for CSLA in the 1988 NCAA Division I track and field 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
While competing for Valley College in 1986, Lohr-Cruz placed second in the 
3,000 meters and third in the 5,000 meters in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Cruz succeeds Louis Ramirez, who resigned to accept the head track and 
cross-country position at L.A. Trade Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Five former Valley-area high school football standouts have had their NFL 
careers delayed by injuries and roster sleight of hand, finding themselves on 
injured reserve lists as the regular season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pringle, who played at Kennedy High and Glendale College and was the 
Atlanta Falcons' sixth-round draft choice in April, has injured ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Affholter, a record-setting wide receiver and kicker while at Oak Park 
High and USC, finds himself on the Green Bay Packers' injured reserve list for 
the second consecutive season, this time because of a hamstring injury. An 
ankle injury sidelined Affholter last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Parkinson, an offensive tackle from Canyon High and USC hoping to stick 
with the Denver Broncos as a free agent, fell victim to a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Kors, a free-agent safety from El Camino Real High and Cal State Long 
Beach who was trying to earn a position with the Seattle Seahawks for the 
second consecutive year, also has a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Former Pierce College and Burroughs High quarterback Erik Kramer, 25, has been 
placed on the injured reserve list by the Detroit Lions. He sustained a bruised 
right shoulder in Detroit's 35-21 exhibition win over Kansas City on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Under NFL rules, all five must sit out a minimum of four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Former Westlake High catcher Mike Lieberthal, the third pick in the June 
amateur draft, will play in the Philadelphia Phillies' young-timers' game 
Tuesday at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal's appearance in the game, which precedes a Philadelphia-Pittsburgh 
game, is part of a seven-week Instructional League assignment that he will 
begin Friday in Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, who this summer hit .228 for Martinsville, the Phillies' Rookie 
League team in the Appalachian League, will be among 30 of the Phillies' top 
prospects who have been assigned to the league. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunlap, Cal Lutheran basketball coach, has completed recruiting with a 
class of 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
Among his previously unannounced recruits are Paul Tapp, a 6-foot-2 guard from 
Burbank High; Chris Johnson, a 6-4 junior forward from Los Angeles Trade Tech; 
Simon O'Donnell, a 6-6 junior forward from Lassen Junior College; Russell 
White, a 6-4 forward from Camelback High in Phoenix; and Tom Sglav, a 6-5 
junior forward from Cabrillo Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
Two other recruits will redshirt this season. Shaunte Barnes, a 5-11 guard from 
Cathedral High in San Francisco, will sit out because he failed to meet 
Proposition 48 academic requirements, and Aaron Mensey, a 6-5 forward, will sit 
out the year after transferring from Missouri Baptist. He has one year of 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Hill, Cal Lutheran baseball coach, said he has added 29 recruits to his 
NAIA District 3 championship team and junior-varsity squad. 
</P>
<P>
Area players among the recruits include Darin Furlong, an infielder from 
Moorpark College; Bryan Leiser, a pitcher from Ventura College; Rich Mendez, a 
pitcher from Ventura College; Jim Doushgounian, an infielder from Pierce; Steve 
Dempsey, a pitcher from Glendale College; David Brownfield, a 
catcher-outfielder from Montclair Prep; and Andre Matalon, a catcher from 
Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Shwartzer, a former Reseda High and Pierce College catcher, will sign a 
scholarship agreement with San Diego State when he visits the school this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Shwartzer, who is eligible to transfer immediately, nonetheless will take 
classes at College of the Canyons this semester, then transfer to San Diego 
State in January, his father Howie said. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Gibson (6-4, 210 pounds), a right-hander from College of the Canyons and 
El Camino Real High, has orally committed to play baseball next season on 
scholarship at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore last season at Canyons, Gibson was 4-5 with an earned-run 
average of 3.68 in 15 appearances as both a starter and a reliever. Two summers 
ago, Gibson was the No. 1 starter for the Woodland Hills West American Legion 
team that won the World Series title in Millington, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 19, was 7-2 this summer for the Valley Rangers, a National Baseball 
Congress team.

<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach City College officials said late Wednesday that Oxnard College Coach 
Lindsay Meggs has been hired as the school's baseball coach, filling a vacancy 
created when Ken Gaylord resigned earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Meggs, who was an assistant at Cal Lutheran in 1989, led the Condors to a 14-22 
record last season, his first at Oxnard. Oxnard finished 10th among 11 teams in 
the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord, who coached at Long Beach City College for six seasons, accepted a 
similar position at Cerritos College. Oxnard officials were unavailable for 
comment regarding a replacement for Meggs. JEFF RILEY

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday reluctantly settled a $4-million lawsuit, clearing 
the way for construction of a 216-unit apartment complex on Holt Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Council members agreed to the settlement after the city attorney and city 
administrator urged them to live up to commitments made to the developer and 
warned them that the suit put the city in financial peril. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Ventures Corp. filed the lawsuit in December against the city and its 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the city agreed to sell the corporation four acres on Holt 
Avenue, between Palomares and Towne avenues, for an apartment project but 
reneged on the deal by changing the zoning in the General Plan to block the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning was changed from high-density mixed use to commercial and 
single-family residential. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the city must approve zone changes to clear the way for 
the apartment project and pay Urban Ventures $16,000 to cover its legal 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The city must also sell the property to Urban Ventures for $900,000, the price 
that was established in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto complained that city staff members in 1987 had led 
council members to believe they were voting simply to sell the property to 
Urban Ventures, not to approve any future development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith on Tuesday night suggested that the council reject the 
proposed settlement, but City Atty. Arnold M. Glasman immediately asked for a 
closed-door session to discuss the legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, when the council resumed its meeting in public, Glasman said the 
city must live up to its contracts. "If we don't approve this settlement," he 
said, "the city is exposing itself to substantial financial impact upon the 
redevelopment and city budgets." 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes promised the council that the city will 
require Urban Ventures to meet all building standards and other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Then, without further comment, the council voted 3 to 0 to approve the 
settlement, with Smith abstaining.

MINER WINS REPRIEVE TO STAY ON LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Joe Bagwell, the last gold miner living on a claim in Angeles National 
Forest, won a temporary reprieve from a federal order that called for him and 
his family to move from the public land by Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Bagwell said he was relieved and happy that the effort to move 
him was delayed last week. But he remains upset that local federal officials 
will not grant the blasting permit he needs to continue mining. 
</P>
<P>
Bagwell, a fast-talking Alabama native who has represented himself in the 
lengthy court proceedings, said Tuesday: "How can I operate without a blasting 
permit? Now I say: 'Please give me blasting permit.' They say: 'No-no-no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials handling the case said they have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco granted 
Bagwell's request for a stay of a District Court decision ordering him off the 
public land, pending his appeal of that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
For half a dozen years, Bagwell and the U.S. Forest Service have been fighting 
over his right to remain on the mining claim. Bagwell maintains that federal 
officials are unduly forcing him to leave his home and claim, which he 
established 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles ruled against Bagwell, saying 
the decorated Vietnam War veteran was running a sham mining operation as a way 
to live free on a desolate chunk on mountain land 10 miles north of Pasadena. 
Wilson ordered Bagwell to leave the land, remove all of his mining equipment 
and restore the premises to a natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Bagwell, his wife, Cynthia, and their two school-age children live in a 
rough-hewn house along a creek bed by his mining operation. They have been 
living on welfare, Bagwell says, because federal officials have thwarted his 
attempts to run a mine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got no choice but to fight," Bagwell said. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not receive a blasting permit soon, he added, "I guess next week I'm 
going to have to file more (legal) papers."

CZECH TEACHER CHECKS IN AT SAN GABRIEL HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last fall, Czechoslovakian high school teacher Eva Jamrichova witnessed the 
wonder of Vaclav Havel's "Velvet Revolution," which triumphantly ended more 
than 40 years of Communist rule in her native land. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Jamrichova will bring her eyewitness accounts to San Gabriel High 
School, where she will teach world history on a Fulbright exchange program that 
is also taking San Gabriel High School teacher Ben Molnar to Bratislava, 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Students who file into Molnar's classroom on the first day of school Sept. 12 
expecting their boyish, bespectacled 49-year-old history teacher may be 
intrigued to find a poised, soft-spoken woman of 25 standing behind the podium. 
</P>
<P>
But Jamrichova, who speaks impeccable English and cites William Styron and Kurt 
Vonnegut as her favorite American authors, expects to be equally fascinated by 
her pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," Jamrichova said Friday, sitting atop a desk in Molnar's 
classroom as the departing San Gabriel High teacher bustled about, packing up 
books and instructional materials for his year abroad. "I'm anxious to learn 
many things and experience this way of life." 
</P>
<P>
At her words, Molnar stopped dead in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be interested in you," he told Jamrichova enthusiastically. "They'll 
ask questions about your life, and it's not necessarily bad to spend time 
explaining to them what Czechoslovakia is like. It gives the history a human 
dimension." 
</P>
<P>
Before Molnar left Tuesday, an easy camaraderie grew between the two, who are 
divided by culture and background but united by a common love of teaching and 
hunger for new experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving in Los Angeles last week, Jamrichova has stayed in Molnar's 
Temple City home, where she will live throughout the school year while Molnar 
and his family are in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jamrichova has alerted her friends in Bratislava to help ease Molnar 
into an unfamiliar environment and shepherd him through the intricacies of a 
new language and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left, though, the San Gabriel High School teacher was doing one final 
bit of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been giving her driving lessons," said Molnar, who has also lent 
Jamrichova his car for the year. "It just so happens I'm also a driver's 
training instructor here." 
</P>
<P>
Molnar is one of three U.S. teachers heading for Czechoslovakia this fall on 
the Fulbright Teacher Exchange Program, which is sending 207 U.S. high school 
teachers abroad and bringing an equal number of foreign teachers to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The school already has some experience with foreign teachers. Last year, San 
Gabriel High teacher Roger Baurer won a Fulbright to teach in London for a 
year, while a British teacher came to San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
But this is Czechoslovakia's inaugural year in the program, and San Gabriel 
High School administrators say they look forward to learning about life in 
Central Europe and the recent tumultuous events there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first for us," said Scott Magnusson, assistant principal of 
instruction. "Her personal experiences will certainly enhance her teaching of 
world history." 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Molnar's father was born in a small town not far from 
Bratislava, which was then part of Hungary but is now in Czechoslovakia. When 
he was a child, Molnar's family moved to Germany. Soon after World War II they 
immigrated to the United States under the sponsorship of a Pasadena church. 
</P>
<P>
"My father wanted to go back to Hungary in '49, but he would have been shot," 
Molnar said. "I intend to go to his hometown and check out his roots." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, in fact, Molnar wanted to go to Hungary, not Czechoslovakia. But a 
Fulbright teaching position in Hungary fell through earlier this year, as did a 
second try for Germany. Finally, on a Friday -- July 13 -- Molnar got a call 
from the Fulbright people asking if he would consider teaching conversational 
English for a year in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Molnar, who teaches U.S. government, world history, U.S. history and economics 
at San Gabriel High and speaks no Slavic languages, decided to seize the day. 
His wife and three children -- ages 10, 12 and 16 -- will accompany him to 
Bratislava. 
</P>
<P>
His oldest son, Derek, who would have been a junior at Arcadia High, will be a 
student at Molnar's new high school. 
</P>
<P>
Some adjustments may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"School is more serious in Czechoslovakia," Molnar said. "Life is more 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm curious as to how formal everything is. One of the things I asked Eva was 
whether I have to wear a tie to class. I haven't worn a tie in years," said 
Molnar, who on Friday morning was clad in shorts, a T-shirt and Birkenstocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he can wear jeans to school," responded Jamrichova. 
</P>
<P>
Thus are cultural misconceptions dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
Jamrichova, who studied U.S. and British literature and has a degree in 
English, said that even before last November's revolution, there was little 
censorship in Czechoslovakia, and students read Henry David Thoreau, Herman 
Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare and Oscar 
Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
Jamrichova promises to offer an interesting viewpoint on students, revolution 
and how they linked up one day last November. 
</P>
<P>
For the young teacher, Czechoslovakia's revolution began in earnest when her 
students went on strike in support of university artists and writers who were 
initiating a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, they came to school, but they rejected learning," Jamrichova said. 
Lesson plans went out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, "we were just talking openly about what was going on in 
Czechoslovakia. They were very obedient, and they surprised many teachers with 
their maturity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She paused for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine this school and what it will be like," she said. "But I think 
students are the same everywhere."

ARCHITECT DESIGNS FOR CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 30 years as an environmental architect, Cal Poly Pomona professor John T. 
Lyle has helped the Brazilian government preserve coastal forests, saved 
wetlands in Northern Italy and lectured on environmental planning at the 
prestigious Kyushi Institute of Design in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But Lyle has also practiced what he preaches closer to home. He built a 
solar-heated, breeze-cooled architect's studio behind his Sierra Madre canyon 
home. And he has designed a handful of homes on the West Coast with similar 
attributes, including one for a Riverside client that is a case study in 
environmental design. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle's theory -- that buildings should integrate harmoniously with nature and 
the surrounding landscape, instead of lording over it -- has long been a 
quixotic one in a nation whose builders regularly slice tops of ridges, cut 
down trees and erect boxy structures without a thought to natural light or 
water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
But today, as the Middle East crisis spurs an already strong interest in 
alternative energy and conservation, the soft-spoken Lyle believes that the 
tenets he has preached for decades are finally coming into their own. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cycles in these things," says the 56-year-old Lyle. "People are 
getting more and more interested in how architecture fits in with the natural 
landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a surge of interest in Cal Poly's department of landscape 
architecture, where applications have jumped fourfold in the past five years. 
Currently, the school has 294 undergraduate students and 35 graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
And Lyle, who headed the department for many years and wrote "Designing for 
Human Ecosystems," a textbook that is required reading in environmental design 
classes throughout the country, has seen former students enter the work force 
and apply his principles throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"He changed my whole way of looking at the profession," says Julie Riley, a 
landscape architect with the Los Angeles' Department of Parks and Recreation 
who heads a water conservation effort in city parks. Riley is experimenting 
with turf grass that requires less watering, and new methods of irrigation. She 
says that many of her ideas first percolated in Lyle's classes. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us we shouldn't just be exterior decorators, we should be aware of how 
what we do affects the environment as a functioning living landscape, not just 
a decorative, pretty one," Riley says. 
</P>
<P>
A stroll through Lyle's garden -- which won a national design award from the 
American Society of Landscape Architects in 1986 -- illustrates how the Cal 
Poly professor has put his ideas into practical use. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into the terraced back yard, one hears the steady drip, drip of water 
into a stone pond. Floating on the pond's top are water lilies that Lyle grew 
to minimize evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
A recirculating pump keeps the water fresh. And swimming in the pond are fat 
golden koi and bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle originally hoped to raise and fatten the latter fish for family dinners 
with his wife and two children, Cybele, 17, and Alex, 21. But that plan was 
scrapped when his children protested. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids didn't want to eat their pets," he says with rueful resignation. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a few fruit trees and a vegetable garden, most of the 
plants in Lyle's back yard require little watering. There are huge bushes of 
fragrant rosemary, rockrose and a ground cover of drought-resistant arctotheca 
to cover the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good substitute for grass or ivy," says Lyle, who rails against 
gardens that are "artificially supported by chemicals and imported water." 
</P>
<P>
His home, built in 1949 by Southern California modernist architect Harwell 
Harris, abuts the majestic San Gabriel Mountains. It blends elements of Greene 
&amp; Greene and California Craftsman architectural style, with several walls 
made of clear glass that showcase the stunning view. Lyle and his family moved 
into the home in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to Lyle's studio, one passes neatly painted white beehives that 
supply honey for his family. The studio itself echoes the architectural motifs 
of the house, down to its bluish-gray slatted wood exterior to the overhung 
eaves and outdoor terrace. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some differences: the studio's facing is made of cedar; the house 
of pine. Harwell "had to use pine," Lyle says. "It was the only building 
material he could get in 1949, after the war." 
</P>
<P>
The home also uses traditional fossil fuels for heating, reflecting the mood of 
the late 1940s when America, tired of years of conserving and flush with 
victory in World War II, dove gleefully into massive consumption. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the studio built in 1986 includes a passive solar heating system 
that looks like a large terrarium. Two-story glass windows collect the sunlight 
that streams in. A layer of gravel inside the windows traps the heat, which 
rises and disperses through the book-lined study upstairs by means of a slatted 
wood ceiling, which lets the warm air circulate. 
</P>
<P>
During summer, the studio is cooled by canyon breezes that blow in through the 
windows, which face north and south. 
</P>
<P>
Although the studio was a modest project, Lyle has also designed several homes 
for private clients that incorporate his environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorites went up 10 years ago in Riverside County. Solar heated, 
cooled by the winds, built partially into a hillside and planted with 
indigenous flora that provide shade in summer and require little water, the 
home is energy efficient and iconoclastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very heartening that there are people in positions of such influence in 
the educational world," says Julia Russell, founder of an environmental 
clearinghouse called Eco-Home. Ten years ago, Russell turned her modest Los 
Feliz bungalow into an ecologically sound home and in the process launched a 
cottage industry that publishes educational materials on how others can make 
such changes. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Vail, a former Lyle student who runs the Irvine land planning firm 
Vail, Speck, Taylor, calls the Cal Poly professor his "philosophical mentor." 
</P>
<P>
"He really inspired me," Vail says. "The things he was espousing were things I 
had a vague concept of, and he helped me crystallize them." 
</P>
<P>
Vail has had ample opportunity these days to try out his ideas. Recently, he 
completed a wetlands restoration project for Del Mar and is working on a joint 
development-restoration project for Bolsa Chica, a 1,600-acre coastal property 
near Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the last two years, particularly with the emerging environmental 
consciousness, there's been a tremendous interest and enormous interest in the 
ideas that John had," Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
Planners and architects involved in environmental preservation say they hope 
the trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"People living in cities have lost contact with nature and how it relates to 
their lives," says Lyle. "We can design environments that fit with nature, but 
people need to know that this type of design exists. And then maybe they'll 
demand it, and builders will be forced to provide it."

CLASS SIZES TO INCREASE DUE TO SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada Board of Education on Tuesday adopted a $17.3 -- million budget 
for the 1990-91 school year, after slashing $900,000 and increasing class sizes 
because of shortfalls in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, up about 8% from last year, includes a 6% salary raise for 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But average class size is expected to grow from 27.5 to 29 students in 
kindergarten through sixth grade and from 30 to 32.5 in grades 7-12. 
</P>
<P>
The increases in class size will save about $270,000, said Andrew Meyer, 
assistant district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
One administrative and at least four teaching positions were not filled, and 
several custodial and secretarial jobs were scaled back as part of the cuts, 
said Carole Siegler, a Board of Education member. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are projecting a budget deficit of at least $730,000 in 
1991-92. The Committee for Quality Education, a La Canada Flintridge citizens 
group formed last spring, is trying to augment the budget by pushing for a 
school parcel tax next year, Siegler said.

MAN SENT TO PRISON FOR TRY ON WIFE'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man who said he tried to kill himself and his wife because they were 
going to be evicted from their home has been sentenced to 10 years in prison 
for attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Superior Court Judge George Xanthos also recommended that Arthur 
Cunningham, 53, receive psychiatric counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he attacked his wife, Arjean Cunningham, 46, with a hammer 
while she was sleeping the morning of Dec. 21 because he had learned that the 
couple was going to be evicted. He then attempted to take his own life by 
slashing his wrists. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty Aug. 7 to second-degree attempted murder and intent to 
inflict great bodily harm. He could have received up to 13 years in prison, 
Deputy Public Defender Bruce Schweiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County marshals discovered the couple in their Maryland Avenue 
condominium when they arrived to serve the eviction notice later that morning, 
Schweiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Arjean Cunningham and her sister inherited the condominium from their parents, 
but her sister ordered the eviction because the Cunninghams had not paid the 
mortgage, he said.

2 KILLED IN MURDER-SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Los Feliz woman was shot to death in her bathtub by a man who 
then shot and killed himself, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellie Jean Bagley was shot once in the head between 7 and 7:30 p.m. Friday by 
a man who the victim's mother identified only as Antonio, Police Detective 
Loren Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not yet determined the man's full name, age or the nature of his 
relationship with Bagley, Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no motive for the killings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley's mother discovered the bodies after she used her key to enter her 
daughter's apartment in the 1700 block of North Edgemont Street, Zimmerman 
said. The woman became worried when her daughter failed to telephone her, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of forced entry, leading police to believe that Bagley 
allowed the man inside and locked the door behind him, Zimmerman said.

After five years of study and debate, Burbank city officials Wednesday outlined 
a plan to control growth in the city's Media District, fast emerging as one of 
the country's largest centers of entertainment-oriented industries. 
</P>
<P>
City and studio officials called the Media District Specific Plan one of the 
most restrictive in Southern California. But homeowners complained that it does 
not do enough to control the encroachment of commercial and industrial 
development into their neighborhoods -- resurrecting the disagreements that 
have kept the plan tied up in hearings since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Home to the Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC studios, the Media District grew 
largely uncontrolled during the early 1980s, transforming an area often 
referred to sarcastically as "Beautiful Downtown Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
The district's glass and steel high-rise office buildings each day attract 
about 20,000 people employed by the studios and other entertainment businesses 
that straddle the Ventura Freeway in southwest Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth has been felt by residents of nearby neighborhoods. They say 
their quiet, tree-lined streets have become virtual freeways during rush hour 
and tall buildings have decimated the country-like atmosphere of 
upper-middle-class neighborhoods such as Toluca Lake and the Burbank Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
"During the early 1980s, there was a tremendous influx of high-density, 
high-rise office buildings," City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom said. "Quite 
frankly, not enough thought was given to the cumulative effects of all those 
buildings combined." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council later this fall, the Media District Specific 
Plan will become the blueprint for future development on the 557 acres in the 
southwest corner of Burbank. The plan imposes height limits, density 
restrictions and design standards on new construction and seeks to protect 
nearby residential neighborhoods from commercial and industrial intrusion. It 
encourages the use of alternate transportation and requires companies to cut 
back by 38% the auto traffic they generate over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the plan encourages enough growth to keep the Media 
District an attractive location for studios and other entertainment-oriented 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the departure of the Lockheed Corp. to Georgia, city officials have 
tried to make Burbank more attractive to business, a sore point with some 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents interviewed Wednesday complained that the plan actually would 
increase traffic to gridlock levels and destroy the neighborhoods of 
single-family homes that surround the area. "It is really a placebo to make 
everyone feel good," homeowner Robert Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
City and studio officials acknowledged that the plan, hammered out during five 
years of hearings, is less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best plan we could hope for because no one is ecstatic about it," 
said Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate and facilities planning for 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The plan seeks to unite the different elements of the district, which is 
bisected by the Ventura Freeway and lies roughly between Buena Vista Street and 
Clybourn Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian traffic will be encouraged throughout the district with the 
construction of plazas. City planners especially want to maintain heavy 
pedestrian use of Riverside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The plan imposes a height limit of 205 feet on projects that get conditional 
use permits. Other buildings would be limited to 35 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Studios also will be affected, but some officials said Wednesday that the 
plan's publication will allow them to proceed with projects that have been put 
on hold. Alan Epstein, vice president of the Disney Development Co., said all 
Disney projects in Burbank have been delayed for the last five years as the 
company waited to find out what restrictions the plan would impose. O'Neill 
said NBC has delayed development of its 800,000 square-foot NBC Plaza project 
for at least a year.

DRIVER IS ATTACKED AFTER CAR HITS 2 BOYS; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: SOME SEE RACIAL OVERTONES IN BEATING OF LATINO MAN IN BLACK AREA OF 
SOUTH L.A. POLICE ARREST 4 MEN.

<P>
A Latino immigrant was beaten and badly injured after a traffic accident in 
South-Central Los Angeles in which his car struck and injured two black 
children, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the man's family and police said the incident had racial overtones, 
but relatives of the children and the four men arrested after the beating said 
their anger was sparked by what they saw as a callous attitude on the part of 
the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident Tuesday shows how easily underlying cultural tensions 
can erupt into violence -- especially in South-Central Los Angeles where large 
numbers of Latino immigrants have been moving into traditionally black 
neighborhoods over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Guillermo Alvarado, 43, was backing his car out of a parking space 
behind his apartment building on West Colden Avenue when he accidentally struck 
a black child, 7-year-old Daveyon James, who was passing by on a skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, according to police accounts, a group of black men had gathered, at least 
one of them armed with a broomstick. Racial epithets were uttered. Alvarado 
panicked, police said, and while trying to escape in his car he struck another 
black child, pinning the boy against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
When it was all over, four black men were in jail and Alvarado lay in a 
hospital bed, his face bruised and bloodied, police said. The two boys, who 
suffered broken bones, were treated in hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
Black residents said the beating was sparked not by race as much as anger over 
the injuries to the two children and the fact that Alvarado seemed not to care. 
Latino residents were reluctant to discuss the incident, but members of 
Alvarado's family said they believe it was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not uncommon for traffic accidents in Los Angeles to lead to 
fistfights and shouting matches, police said cultural differences may in fact 
have been partly responsible for the Colden Avenue accident's escalating into a 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood is changing and those things tend to happen," said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Steve Sullivan, who is investigating the case. "You 
have these black neighborhoods and you have people thinking other people 
shouldn't live there." 
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of police officers Tuesday night, Alvarado's wife and two 
children moved out of their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
They had moved into the neighborhood only a month earlier to be closer to the 
South-Central factory where Alvarado works as a janitor, said Rosa Rodriguez, 
Alvarado's wife. 
</P>
<P>
They now are living with Rodriguez's sister in predominantly Latino East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I are not sure what brought about the beating," Rodriguez said 
Wednesday. "I think it was racial. That's why we moved out. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that my family is afraid," she added, "and we don't want 
anything like this to happen again. We came back to East L.A. to stay -- 
permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses agree that once Alvarado struck Daveyon James, his car 
continued backing up, with the boy pinned under the car. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado then struck another child -- David Jennings, also 7 -- and kept going 
until the car hit the wall of the apartment building, pinning David against it 
and injuring his leg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said a group of men, some of them relatives of the two boys, came out 
of apartment buildings lining Colden Avenue. They ran to the car and began 
beating Alvarado "with sticks and fists" as he sat in the driver's seat, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, one of the men yelled out "those (expletive) Mexicans" 
while beating Alvarado with the broomstick and the skateboards of the injured 
boys. When Rodriguez emerged from her apartment to pull the assailants away 
from her husband, she was also struck, Detective Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever Lou Deal, 48, said the men directed their anger at Alvardo not because he 
is Latino, but because he did not stop to help the children he had injured. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have stopped the car and got out to see about the child he hit," 
said Deal, Daveyon's grandmother, "Any time you hit a child by accident, you 
see if he's O.K. This (man) just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
Daveyon's mother, Phyllis Perryman, added: "The little ones who were playing 
with Daveyon started hollering and screaming at (Alvarado) to stop, so somebody 
could pull my boy out. "After he hit the second boy, hey, that's when the 
trouble started." 
</P>
<P>
A large crowd had gathered at the scene by the time a police patrol car arrived 
about 6:30 p.m. Four men -- John Childress, 27; Pierre Nutall, 26; Kevin Keys, 
28, and Ronnie Rosenthal, 27 -- were arrested and booked on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon. However, some witnesses questioned whether police 
had arrested the right men. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not pursue charges against Alvarado because they 
considered the injury of the children to be an accident. However, Sullivan said 
the district attorney's office would review the case today. 
</P>
<P>
Daveyon suffered a broken leg and David's arm was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado was also hospitalized and later released. Reached at his 
sister-in-law's East Los Angeles home, relatives said he could not speak 
because of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said she and her husband cannot speak English fluently. Before 
Tuesday's accident, they had little interaction with the non-Spanish-speaking 
residents in their apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
"Our daughters play together with all the children in the apartment," she said. 
"But the older Latino people who can't speak English, we keep to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of both groups said there have never been any serious conflicts 
between blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be starting any mess with each other because of this," said Roslee 
Nutall, the wife of one of the arrested men. "The Latino people here will be 
going about their business, and we'll be going about ours."

HOLLYWOOD CORNER INFAMOUS FOR DECAY TO GET A MAKEOVER; 
</P>
<P>
URBAN RENEWAL: CITY OFFICIALS UNVEIL PLAN FOR RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL PROJECT. 
IT WOULD REPLACE A CRIME-RIDDEN CLUSTER OF ABANDONED SHOPS.

<P>
A notoriously dangerous and crime-ridden corner of Hollywood could become a 
gleaming model of redevelopment under a Cinderella-style transformation plan, 
city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The abandoned cluster of fast-food restaurants, strip mall stores and an 
earthquake-damaged hotel -- which Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo called a 
snake pit -- stands decaying at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any other corner in Hollywood that inspires this much dread 
in people," Woo said at a news conference on the northeast corner of the 
intersection, as city officials, neighborhood activists and an occasional 
transient looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the corner include 88,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 
including a supermarket and drugstore. Above the retail outlets, 190 units of 
low-income housing for senior citizens are planned. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Woo said, the commercial half of the project should break 
ground in late spring, with the housing to follow shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
"This corner should be a gateway to the Los Feliz and Hollywood communities," 
Woo said. "If we can make this project a success, it will send out shock waves 
to the rest of the city that redevelopment works." 
</P>
<P>
The project would cost about $14 million and encompass 3.2 acres. It would be 
developed by the private Hollywest Associates group, which owns the property, 
with the help of $4.4 million in loans and financing from the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The financing is critical to the project, because Hollywest has expressed 
reservations about the high cost of financing the project and its location in 
such a rundown area, said Woo and Donald Spivack, the CRA's director of 
operations for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Development of the area is considered especially important because a Metro Rail 
stop is planned for the southeast corner of Hollywood and Western, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Area business people expressed guarded optimism. "We need redevelopment," said 
Yit Chong, manager of the B &amp; B Burgers across Western. "It's too much like 
a jungle here." 
</P>
<P>
The project cleared its first hurdle Wednesday when it was approved by the CRA 
Housing Committee. The CRA's board of commissioners is expected to give its 
approval today. The City Council has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA is touting the mixed-use project as a cornerstone of its $922-million 
Hollywood redevelopment effort, and city officials say they expect the 
project's financing to be approved without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will anchor the eastern end of Hollywood," Spivack said. "It will 
stabilize the area and attract more private development." 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledged they have their work cut out. As they spoke at the 
site, a newly hired armed guard watched over the boarded-up buildings. Beside 
him stood a fence erected to keep out drug dealers, prostitutes and the 132 
transients who lived in the abandoned Rector Hotel on the corner until police 
kicked them out two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were four burglaries, seven thefts from cars, eight cars 
stolen, 12 assaults with deadly weapons and 40 robberies at the site, according 
to police statistics. Police said there have been eight burglaries so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It has had a history of problems," said Capt. Rick Dinse, commanding officer 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of at least eight area neighborhood organizations are 
supporting the project. Some, such as the Los Feliz Oaks Homeowners Assn., have 
been behind it through the three years it has taken to inch the project through 
the city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as the Los Feliz Improvement Assn., got behind it only recently, 
after developers cut the number of housing units in half. 
</P>
<P>
"The crime is hideous," said Beth Jacobs of the Los Feliz Oaks group, which 
says it represents 700 residents. "At one time, this used to be a busy business 
and commercial district for the surrounding neighborhoods. But there is nothing 
left."

L.A. SCRAMBLES TO GUARD AIR FORCE BASE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE FACILITY HOUSES A PRIZED RESEARCH UNIT. OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE 
EAGER TO BE ITS NEW HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Apart from the guards at the gate, the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo 
resembles a corporate headquarters more than a military installation -- no 
whirling radar dishes, no thundering jets. The facility's main feature: a 
six-story office complex. 
</P>
<P>
What the base lacks in Top Gun appeal, though, it more than makes up in 
scientific and engineering prowess. Housed inside is the 3,200-employee Space 
Systems Division, a highly prized Air Force research and development arm that 
oversees procurement of much of the military's space hardware. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why Los Angeles-area business and political leaders are 
scrambling to block a proposal to close the base and relocate the space 
division, possibly to Colorado or New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Three communities -- Riverside, Colorado Springs and Albuquerque, N.M. -- have 
mounted vigorous campaigns to land the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, among tentative cost-reduction moves announced by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this year, also contemplates relocation of the 
Aerospace Corp., a 4,000-employee research and development center in El Segundo 
that works closely with the Space Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes as some local aerospace firms, hit by defense cuts, are 
shifting operations to less-costly communities. This has raised fears that the 
Air Force's departure would accelerate the trend. 
</P>
<P>
It has also galvanized local business leaders who believe the Los Angeles area 
should do more to protect its high-tech industries -- assets, they say, it has 
foolishly taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new ballgame," said James Miscoll, vice chairman of Bank of America and 
chairman of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "We have to be willing to 
cut some deals to keep these people here. We can't keep saying we don't have to 
make deals because in California the sun shines every day." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Air Force Base is among seven domestic air bases the Pentagon is 
studying for closure to help trim the defense budget. The others: Bergstrom Air 
Force Base in Texas, Eaker Air Force Base in Arkansas, Myrtle Beach Air Force 
Base in South Carolina, England Air Force Base in Louisiana, Wurtsmith Air 
Force Base in Michigan and Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Cheney and 
Air Force Secretary Donald Rice are expected to make final recommendations on 
all seven bases in December. Options include moving only part of the space 
division. A decision to close Los Angeles Air Force Base outright would require 
the approval of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force cites several reasons for targeting the El Segundo facility. 
Among them are high costs of local services and a scarcity of land for 
expansion of the space division, which is expected to experience long-term 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The problem the Air Force mentions most often is that high housing costs in the 
Los Angeles area, coupled with an inadequate federal pay scale, makes life 
difficult for the division's work force. 
</P>
<P>
Though the base has 574 housing units in San Pedro for uniformed personnel, 
more than 1,000 of its military employees and all 1,450 of its civilians must 
find living quarters in the Los Angeles area's high-priced housing market. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the department says, the space division has trouble hiring and 
retaining qualified civilian personnel, and some employees -- both military and 
civilian -- commute from distant, lower-cost communities to make ends meet. An 
Air Force captain with eight years' experience must support a family on $3,468 
a month in Los Angeles. A middle-level civilian aerospace engineer with eight 
years' experience receives a monthly salary of $3,031, the Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
"These factors detract from the goal of producing a professional management 
team for future space systems development," the Air Force said in a draft 
economic impact statement released in July. 
</P>
<P>
Such talk frightens local supporters of the Space Systems Division, which 
oversees procurement of military hardware ranging from heavy-lift rockets to 
spy and navigational satellites. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Air Force, closing the base would cost the local economy $1.25 
billion a year and mean a loss of 17,000 direct and related jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The two space units are also valued for stimulating high-tech research in the 
local aerospace industry and area universities. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wazzan, dean of UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science, said 
his graduate students and faculty have access to experts and laboratories at 
the Aerospace Corp., bolstering their work in areas such as communications, 
laser technology and high speed electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Wazzan said scientists and engineers at the Space Systems Division and the 
Aerospace Corp. routinely conduct brainstorming sessions involving local 
aerospace companies and universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Literally, I can hang up the phone and in an hour be down there," he said. "I 
would not be able to do that if they are in Colorado or in New Mexico. It would 
be even worse for a student." 
</P>
<P>
"They are a fantastic catalyst," he added. "To dismantle that, my God, why? . . 
. It would damn near be a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Iacobellis, chief operating officer of Rockwell International Corp., said 
the proximity of the Space Systems Division gives an advantage to Los Angeles 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that a $1.3-billion program under which Rockwell is building 28 global 
positioning satellites for the Defense Department has often required daily 
contact with space systems personnel overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
Losing that next-door relationship, Iacobellis said, would give aerospace 
companies one less reason to concentrate their resources in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed relocation "could be the beginning of the unraveling of the 
nucleus of the aerospace industry we have in the Los Angeles Basin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While spreading such warnings, area business and political leaders have 
launched an aggressive drive to dissuade the Air Force from moving. 
</P>
<P>
The enlistees include the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, South Bay 
chambers and city governments, a bipartisan coalition of 17 area congressmen 
and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Their chief argument is that the tentative plan to close the base, far from 
being economical, would waste tax money. Instead of a conventional 
base-closing, they point out, the plan involves the relocation of large and 
highly complex operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force declines to say how much such a relocation would cost, but 
opponents of the move assert that the price would approach $1 billion. They 
question whether economic pressures affecting the base come close to justifying 
such an expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Edwin Peura, third in command of the Space Systems Division, says that it 
may not be cost-effective to relocate both the space division and the Aerospace 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no economic advantages to the government to move a work force of 
7,000 people," he said. But Peura agreed that a move might mean better off-base 
housing, easier commutes and other improvements for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Lifestyle will be a factor in the department's final decision, according to 
Col. Peter Bogy, the Air Force representative in recent community hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, not to be slighted is the quality of life of our military and 
civilian employees," Bogy said. 
</P>
<P>
Bogy also said that the division will not be moved unless Congress passes 
legislation allowing the Air Force to use proceeds from the sale of its El 
Segundo and San Pedro property to help cover relocation costs. Currently, 
income from the sale of military property is used to purchase land for parks or 
wildlife refuges, or for general government purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Local supporters of the base have promised to help resolve what the Air Force 
calls the base's most pressing need -- 250 more military housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of El Segundo, Hawthorne and Los Angeles all said they are looking 
for government or other land for such living quarters. Hawthorne said it may 
use redevelopment money to build a military housing complex on one of several 
sites, among them surplus school property and a large plant nursery that is for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's office, at the urging of Los Angeles chamber officials 
and aerospace executives, is studying how state housing programs could help 
finance construction. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very highly skilled employees who represent much of what our Los 
Angeles economy is all about," said Kenneth Gibson, director of the state 
Department of Commerce. "You're talking about losing a critical mass here which 
could be extremely damaging to the economy." 
</P>
<P>
And extremely helpful to the community that might land the Space Systems 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is considering several sites: Vandenberg Air Force Base near 
Lompoc, March Air Force Base near Riverside, Kirtland Air Force Base in 
Albuquerque, and the Peterson and Falcon bases near Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the strongest lobbying is coming from the Inland Empire, 
Colorado and New Mexico. In each of those areas, boosters say the Space Systems 
Division represents the "clean" high-tech growth they are trying to foster. 
</P>
<P>
"When an economic development group has the chance to attract this many jobs 
that are clean industry, our eyes light up," said Stephen Albright, chairman of 
an Inland Empire business coalition seeking the space unit and a member of the 
Southern California Air Quality Management District governing board. 
</P>
<P>
Kenn Holzer, head of a state-appointed panel working to lure the space division 
to New Mexico, said, "This would put the state of New Mexico on the map as far 
as our high-tech capabilities are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The suitors have sweeteners. Colorado Springs is offering 200 acres of free 
land outside Peterson Air Force Base. The state may provide low-cost loans for 
construction of space division facilities, according to Wanda Reeves, member of 
a state task force promoting Colorado's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer said the New Mexico task force has low-cost private financing in place 
to assist the Aerospace Corp. in building facilities. The group is also 
considering a plan to offer special home financing for employees moving east. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, Albright said, several cities with redevelopment work 
planned near March Air Force Base are willing to use those projects to build 
support facilities for the space division. 
</P>
<P>
In all three areas, officials are saying that their housing costs, availability 
of land, and lifestyle for military and civilian families would be a big 
improvement over Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles area business leaders said they are determined to meet the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we've opened the door and aerospace growth has just fallen in," 
said John Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
"Now we're going to have to fight for what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials are scheduled to decide the fate of Los Angeles Air Force 
Base in December. Closure of the facility and relocation of the space systems 
division would require congressional approval. U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica) expects lobbying over the issue to become intense in Washington. "I 
think we have a serious fight on our hands," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STRAY FLASHLIGHT FORCED EMERGENCY LAX 
LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flashlight left by a mechanic in a wheel gear system forced a United Airlines 
Boeing 737 jetliner to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International 
Airport on Aug. 21, the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB inspector in charge of the investigation, James Wall, said the 
flashlight prevented the jet's right main landing gear from unlocking so its 
two wheels could be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
The jet skidded to a safe landing on its nose gear, left main gear and the 
engine under the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
The 107 people aboard slid down emergency chutes and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The flight from Oakland was diverted to LAX from the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport at 9 a.m. when a cockpit light indicated an unsafe landing gear.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY FINED $2,000 FOR UNREPORTED 
DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was fined $2,000 Wednesday by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission, which said he failed to disclose receiving 
$1,800 from a contract-seeking company while serving on a local transportation 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC said that Bradley, while an appointed member of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, chaired the meeting at which the panel voted to 
award a contract for an environmental study to a local firm, Gruen Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The study was aimed at detailing the impact of light rail service routes on the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he chaired the particular meeting in which this contract was voted upon, 
he participated in the decision," the FPPC said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Feb. 11, 1987, vote, Bradley's political campaign had received three 
checks from Gruen in 1986 -- one for $600 in March, another for $200 in August 
and a third for $1,000 in October.

MAYOR'S PANEL POSES OPTIONS FOR LATC; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE STUDY GROUP OUTLINES THREE PLANS, INCLUDING ONE TO CONVERT THE 
FACILITY INTO A CITY-OWNED COMPLEX WITH DIFFERENT PRODUCTION COMPANIES. IN THE 
MEANTIME, THE CRA URGES ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff of the city Community Redevelopment Agency has recommended an 
additional $998,390 subsidy to the Los Angeles Theatre Center -- while a 
commission studying the facility has produced three draft recommendations, 
including a plan to convert it into a city-owned stage complex with the 
existing LATC company just one of several producers. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA will deliver a staff report to its board today calling for the 
additional grant, which would continue city payments to defer debt service and 
building maintenance costs, without which LATC managers have said they might 
not be able to complete the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
The draft recommendation to restructure the LATC, from the Mayor's LATC Study 
Group, is one of three options presented in a closely held report placed in 
limited circulation late last week. The document also proposed two other draft 
options: outright closure of the four-stage LATC pending extensive 
re-evaluation of how to make use of it, and, at the opposite extreme, 
preservation of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
The new grant, which would require City Council approval, is in addition to 
$750,000 in subsidy money approved in July. The nearly $1.75 million in the two 
grants would bring total city financial commitments to the LATC to $20.4 
million since the redevelopment agency proposed luring a theater complex to 
Spring Street in 1978 and 1979 as a means of revitalizing the historic core of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The report now under review is the first of three drafts expected to emerge 
from the study group. A second and more detailed draft is expected to be 
finished early next week, with the final version scheduled for completion as 
early as Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the study group emphasized that the three options in the 
initial draft report do not necessarily indicate the precise recommendations 
the study group may make. These sources, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, characterized the options as among a larger and more varied number 
of possible solutions the study group has discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the draft report were obtained by The Times and confirmed 
independently by three sources familiar with the document. The study group was 
appointed earlier this year by Mayor Tom Bradley. It is headed by William 
Wingate, a New York City consultant who previously served as executive managing 
director of the Center Theatre Group. 
</P>
<P>
Ongoing financial difficulties at the LATC stem from overly optimistic 
projections of the theater center's ability to sustain itself financially and 
to absorb costs of buying the converted former bank building that serves as its 
lobby, building the connected four-theater structure itself and defraying 
ongoing capital expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The theater center has never been able to break even and initial projections of 
the quick end to city subsidies have given way to ongoing needs for continued 
support. Earlier this year, the LATC submitted a proposed five-year plan 
calling for infusion of $32 million more in redevelopment agency or other city 
money -- including complete forgiveness of outstanding capital loans and 
interest and establishment of a $15-million endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The three possible LATC alternatives are presented in an initial draft of the 
study group report, which was was placed in limited circulation among study 
group members and a few other theater officials and civic leaders late last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Mike Woo, a supporter of the LATC, said the financial problems 
the city and the theater center have been struggling to change may mean that 
the option of retaining the status quo is simply not possible. "The status quo 
would mean that the city would have to make a substantial ongoing financial 
commitment to keeping the current structure in place," said Woo. "I don't know 
that we can afford to do that and I don't know that there is the political will 
in council to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said a combination of the status quo and conversion to a multi-producer 
complex may emerge as the solution. Other local theater experts suggested that, 
under such an arrangement, the existing LATC organization might emerge as a 
first-among-equals, responsible for the bulk of the complex's programming, but 
with outside producers of original productions or presenters of touring plays 
filling in the schedule for perhaps a third of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Reorganizing the LATC as a multi-tenant center would adapt, with certain 
modifications, the basic design of the county-owned Music Center complex. 
There, six tenant organizations -- technically called "resident companies" -- 
share space and facilities and are responsible for their own operating costs, 
with maintenance and capital improvement expenses paid for by Los Angeles 
County. The tenants range from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to the Center 
Theatre Group. 
</P>
<P>
The county, in turn, recoups some of its expenses from parking revenues. The 
county cannot hope to earn a profit on the Music Center, but most experts agree 
the value of a government-owned downtown cultural center in Los Angeles 
justifies the financial downside. 
</P>
<P>
Under this system, said a Music Center spokeswoman, the county pays for 
everything from routine janitorial services to replacement of worn carpeting in 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion lobby and worn-out ventilation machinery. The 
arrangement recognizes a reality widely perceived in the creative community -- 
that both mainstream-establishment and experimental-innovative theater and 
music have extreme difficulty in sustaining themselves in terms of production 
and operating costs, as well as providing for real estate-related costs like 
debt-service and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center operating design is widely perceived as one of the better 
models across the country -- superior, for instance, to Lincoln Center in New 
York and the Kennedy Center in Washington, which is currently mired in a 
financial crisis of its own largely caused by a crisis in building maintenance 
and other capital costs. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing the LATC as a city-owned facility where stage producers would not 
be financially responsible for building upkeep has long been the preferred 
option to the management of the existing LATC, led by artistic director Bill 
Bushnell, producing director Diane White and managing director Robert Lear. The 
LATC, however, has not advocated conversion of the center to a multi-company 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
At the redevelopment agency, commissioners are scheduled to review a report 
today from John J. Tuite, the agency's administrator, that concludes the new 
infusion of city money is essential to permit orderly review and implementation 
of recommendations by the Wingate commission. For the study group's report to 
be properly reviewed and decisions based on it to be reached, Tuite concluded, 
the LATC must receive subsidy money to carry it through June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is anticipated the study groups findings will require extensive 
review and consideration," Tuite wrote in the report to be received by the 
redevelopment agency board today, "the recommended funding is necessary in 
order to enable the LATC to complete the fall-winter season."

ROCK 'N' ROLL'S MAIN EVENT: A LOSS OF $1.5 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: POOR ATTENDANCE AND FINANCIAL WOES FORCED THE PROMOTER TO SCRAP THE 
FINAL DAY. 
</P>

<P>
The promoter of last weekend's Rock 'n' Roll's Main Event at Glen Helen 
Regional Park in San Bernardino County said on Wednesday that he lost more than 
$1.5 million on the aborted festival. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scafuto, the Montclair club owner who produced the outdoor affair, said 
he generated only $15,000 in ticket sales on Saturday and Sunday. As a result, 
he canceled the third and final day of the festival Monday, but promised to 
refund the price of admission to those who purchased tickets in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite crowd projections of 30,000 per day, attendance figures never rose 
above 2,000 on Saturday and 4,000 on Sunday. Scafuto said he realized the depth 
of his fiscal crisis when he was forced to ask his bank to open its doors 
Sunday afternoon to provide him with enough cash to pay the acts he hired. 
</P>
<P>
Scafuto, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in promotion, said he could 
not understand why so few attended. 
</P>
<P>
But Moss Jacobs, general manager of Avalon Attractions, Southern California's 
largest independent concert company, attributed the event's poor attendance to 
a combination of factors. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he thought the hot and dry weather associated with San Bernardino 
County probably played an important part in the concert's low draw. He also 
pointed to the "mix-and-match" roster of artists as a possible setback. 
</P>
<P>
"The promoter did not direct his lineup at any specific audience," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, Jacobs speculated, was the fact that September is typically 
considered to be a slow month in the concert industry. He also said business 
has been down across the board in the concert industry. 
</P>
<P>
While Scafuto said he still owed at least one government agency additional 
money for permit fees, he maintained that all the artists who performed 
Saturday and Sunday were paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some entertainers scheduled to play on Monday have yet to receive half 
of their fees. Geoffrey Blumenauer, who represents John Sebastian and Brewer 
and Shipley, two acts scheduled to perform on Monday, said Scafuto told him he 
had no money at this time to complete the transaction, but offered to sign a 
note promising payment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I Putu Silayasa, 13, normally spends his monthlong mid-year vacation flying his 
kite, playing soccer, helping his mother clean the family batik shop or playing 
drums with his grandfather. But this is no ordinary summer. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every morning now, Silayasa has studiously practiced his drumming by 
playing along with a cassette of an adult gamelan ensemble (the traditional 
Balinese percussion orchestra). Later, he jumps aboard a flatbed truck for the 
hour's ride to "Children of Bali" rehearsals at the government art institute in 
Denpasar. 
</P>
<P>
Just ahead: a one-month, coast-to-coast American tour, beginning at 8 p.m. on 
Friday in UCLA's Sunset Canyon Recreation Center as part of the Los Angeles 
Festival. (Other local performances: Saturday at 10 a.m. in Plaza de la Raza, 
Sunday at 6 p.m. in Griffith Park, private appearances on Tuesday at Rosemont 
Avenue Elementary School near Echo Park.) Besides performing, Silayasa and the 
other 9-to-15-year-olds on the tour are scheduled for residency activities, 
workshops and in-school demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Silayasa began drumming five years ago but says he became serious about it only 
in the past six months. Dance accompaniments interest him most: the formal 
patterns of the Legong, in which he drums using a bare hand, or the stick 
drumming on a large instrument for the Baris, where the dancer cues him by 
changes of position and he, in turn, cues the gamelan. 
</P>
<P>
He's already told his parents that he wants to become a professional, and 
though his mother wonders who will take over the family business, she 
acknowledges that "once he gets a goal in his head, he has to reach it." 
</P>
<P>
Silayasa has never been on an airplane before and doesn't know what to expect 
in exotic, far-away America. In contrast, 12-year-old "Children of Bali" Baris 
dancer I Made Bagus Basuki Mahardika is practically a jet-setter. He performed 
in Vancouver this April and even visited Disneyland on a Southern California 
stopover. 
</P>
<P>
Mahardika is definitely eager to return, though he remembers being very cold in 
Canada and was turned off by the very idea of a hamburger. ("Bread with meat 
inside? No thank you.") 
</P>
<P>
He began dancing at 4 1/2 and says he particularly likes the fierce Baris solo 
because the character he portrays is "proud, strong, a warrior -- and he wins." 
He says his teacher told him that he didn't have any problem being a warrior, 
but the layered, intricately decorated costume is very heavy, and he was warned 
not to surrender to it. 
</P>
<P>
Turning is the most difficult task, he says, because the costume panels fly 
out. He's got to manage all that and stay in control. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, during the first full "Children of Bali" run-through in costume, 
Mahardika succeeds in dominating both the gamelan and all the glittering 
collars and aprons and ribbons he wears. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his forceful stamping and dramatic shifts of weight (feet turned out, 
legs often in demi-plie) make you forget how tiny he is. His eyes dart from 
side to side, his fingers quiver as his hands circle in the air. 
</P>
<P>
He never gets nervous, he says, "because I always think of the character and 
how I can embody the spirit of what this dance is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Mahardika's father is principal of a junior high school and his mother a 
doctor's assistant, but both continue to dance. He too plans a double career: 
dancer and doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his 19 "Children of Bali" colleagues, he was chosen for this 
brand-new performing company after winning an islandwide competition. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic adviser I Made Bandem, a leading Balinese authority on music and 
dance, explains that the idea of forming a children's ensemble began to take 
shape about two years ago. "There was a great group in the 1930s," he recalls, 
and on the historic 1952 "Dancers of Bali" tour to America and England, a few 
dancers were children. 
</P>
<P>
The archetypally masculine Baris originated in military drill maneuvers. The 
vibrantly feminine Legong, (usually a duet or trio) derived from ritual 
origins. Each reached its present form in the early decades of this century and 
is not a single dance, but an evolving sub-genre. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bandem says that there are at least 16 different Baris dances, and 
master dance teacher Ni Ketut Arini counts 13 classic Legongs. "These 13 are 
set, too good to mess with," she says, "though new ones are created all the 
time." Arini says she makes all her students study Legong, and only after 
they've mastered that does she allow them to try newer forms. 
</P>
<P>
"There are parts (of Legong) that are pure dance," she explains, "and parts 
that tell a story. In all Balinese dance, you need a contrast between strong, 
sharp movements and sweet, soft ones." 
</P>
<P>
One of Arini's pupils is 11-year-old Ida Ayu Gandayukti, the soloist at the 
beginning and end of the "Children of Bali" Legong. Onstage, Gandayukti carries 
two fans and wears a golden headdress trimmed with 75 frangipani blossoms, a 
glittering belt across her chest, a fringed collar and enormous tassels -- all 
of which shimmer as if they were alive as she begins her incredibly swift, 
dynamic and intricate performance. 
</P>
<P>
And America? Does she have a fantasy about her upcoming visit? A grave pause. 
"I was dreaming about flying in an airplane," she says very quietly and shyly. 
"And then I went to ask someone where Mickey Mouse and Disneyland might be."

STAGE: MULTIMEDIA ARTIST DANIEL MARTINEZ MASTERMINDS A HUGE COLLABORATION TO 
CREATE THE URBAN EPIC 'IGNORE THE DENTS.' HE CALLS IT 'AN OPERA FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HATE OPERA.' 
</P>

<P>
Within earshot of the massive freeway interchange that runs like a fissure 
through East Los Angeles and separates that Latino community from downtown, 
Daniel Martinez's windowless industrial-zone studio is filled with the workaday 
detritus of the multimedia artist. 
</P>
<P>
On the north wall is a stark image of a skull against a yellow and red 
background. Sketches, half-finished works and graphics materials seem to ooze 
out of every corner. It's a work-crazed environment, and filling the air is the 
radio voice of President Bush, conducting a press conference on the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of a foreign war doesn't seem to faze Martinez. Recalling how he and his 
Chicano friends experienced police beatings and invasion of privacy, as well as 
dragnet operations that would shut down their neighborhood streets, he says, 
"We've been at war all the time. Since my childhood, I've been in the middle of 
a cultural war." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 32-year-old Martinez has decided to take the offensive, translate that 
war into an epic about his city and time (subtitled "a micro-urban opera") and 
call it "Ignore the Dents." The fireworks will happen this Friday and Saturday 
at the Million Dollar Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The grand old movie palace on Broadway is a theater Martinez, best-known as a 
maker of large installations that mix media and explore themes of freedom and 
totalitarianism, has found an attractive site for some time. He says that he 
needs the theater's size to contain what he calls "an opera for people who hate 
opera." 
</P>
<P>
It also may be opera for people who love art shows that bring together many 
forms and sensibilities. As mastermind behind the project -- nine months in the 
making -- director Martinez called on the services of Harry Gamboa Jr. 
(script), VinZula Kara (music), Patricia Pretzinger (choreography), Paul Chavez 
(sound), Aubrey Wilson (set and light design), Diane Gamboa (costumes and 
props), Erica Bornstein (assistant director), Liz Young (lobby and theater 
design) and Gibran and Jim Evans (graphic design). 
</P>
<P>
"I call us 'The Dents,' and we're going to remain a group until the 
millennium," Martinez vowed. All of them are rising or established figures in 
the art world, their individual contributions meant to both stand alone and 
blend into the whole "Dents" performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Diane has made variations on the kind of paper costumes which she's exhibited 
before," said Martinez. "Liz's work inside the Million Dollar really is an 
installation, a well as an entry into the world of the piece. Gibran and Jim 
have designed a program (over 80 pages, but kept to an affordable $3) that's a 
work of art in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a chance to bring 10 minds together. The festival provided us (with a 
commission) a crack in the door. Now that we're in, we'll blow up the city," 
insisted the wiry, intense Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
With so many combined visions, this can sound like the Installation/Performance 
That Ate L.A. But Martinez, in conversation, is always referring to what he 
feels are the foundation blocks of "Ignore the Dents": Harry Gamboa's text, 
Kara's score, and Martinez's own aesthetic passion for Dadaism, Futurism and 
Situationism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an intellectual spectacle, not an entertainment. But Harry's writing 
keeps it funny." 
</P>
<P>
The work, though, wasn't so funny when "we met for a month, but couldn't settle 
on any ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa recalled that when they did settle on the title, "things came together." 
Martinez, noting how their favorite pastime is regaling each other with 
stories, set his old pal free to come up with stories, rather than the libretti 
opera normally requires. 
</P>
<P>
Harry delivered: a solo piece about a dying man in an electric chair (played by 
Manazar Gamboa, spiritual godfather to Martinez's Latino artist peers); a tale 
about a scam; "The Atlas Aria," about the Earth spinning out of orbit; "The 
Asphalt Aria," to be sung by opera singers Charles Lane, Luz Maria Garcia and 
Andrew Koch; a story of a photographer facing censorship, and one about a young 
homeless man who goes over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
And more. "My deal with Harry was simple," Martinez revealed. "I trusted him to 
write whatever he wanted, and he trusted me to direct them however I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Kara, who crafts a personal music/sound style called "Popkret" (musique 
concrete and pop), read Harry's pieces and researched opera history. Kara and 
Martinez eventually structured a 13-part form -- each part both a story and a 
variation on an opera composer, from Monteverdi, through Bach, Verdi, Wagner 
and Philip Glass. 
</P>
<P>
"This is performance art," explained Martinez, "since the show won't come 
together until Friday night. I see it as one big show, with a break between 
nights." The live element will be spiced by Kara's own music samplings, a live 
ensemble, and Martinez acting as stage manager, moving scenes on and off as he 
sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends ask me if I'm afraid of doing this. But if I have an idea, I just do 
it." Another recently completed Martinez idea was a design for a future Metro 
Rail station. "I have my father in me," he said. "He helped design the first 
lunar satellite. He wasn't a math wiz, but he had the right instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the street. It's a place of human drama. People try to forget about it, 
so we're gonna bring it to them."

"The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and much of the 
dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris Day and 
John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse 
choreography. And it's good clean American fun. DOUG LIST

UNERRINGLY TRUE TO DICKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISABETH GRAHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director George Cukor's 1935 adaptation of Charles Dickens' "David Copperfield" 
is sparked by a wealth of memorable performances and old-fashioned Hollywood 
glamour. 
</P>
<P>
As entertaining as it is uneven, "David Copperfield" (screening at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center on Friday, Sept. 7) only lightly suggests the 
harder aspects of the novel but is unerringly true to Dickens' characters. The 
uncommon rightness of the casting is still impressive and the performances, 
suitably caricatured but always human, are often surprising in their audacity. 
For Dickens fans and movie fans alike, there is a trove of riches. 
</P>
<P>
The word definitive applies to several portrayals, namely Basil Rathbone's Mr. 
Murdstone, Jessie Ralph's Peggotty, Maureen O'Sullivan's Dora and Edna May 
Oliver's Aunt Betsey. Roland Young, one of Hollywood's very best rogues, 
abandons his charm completely to make Uriah Heep a masterpiece of bizarre 
vocalization and sinuous gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Most memorable of all is W.C. Fields as Micawber, an instance where a role's 
demands and an actor's gifts achieve a harmony seldom seen. Both Freddie 
Bartholomew and Frank Lawton -- as a boy and adult David, respectively -- 
manage to be as winning as possible, considering the scenery chewing going on 
all around them. 
</P>
<P>
The film unfolds episodically, as does the novel, and trusts the book's 
inherent eccentricities, occasional awkwardness and, most of all, its 
sentimentality. Even Fields, a performer certainly not known for warm rapport 
with fellow actors, is a marvel of understated empathy as be bids David to 
"come, little friend, open your heart." 
</P>
<P>
An elaborate exhibit of the parts being greater than the whole, "David 
Copperfield" is chockablock with choice moments. It remains a living tribute to 
producer David O. Selznick's perfectionism and Cukor's unsurpassed ability to 
draw the best from the best. 
</P>
<P>
What: "David Copperfield." 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday, Sept. 7, at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Take the Riverside Freeway to Euclid Street, head north on 
Malvern, then go west.

SEEING IT HIS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
SINATRA'S PERFECT ARTISTRY OUTWEIGHS HIS IMPRFECT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago I received a kind note from Frank Sinatra, a response to a 
review lauding one of his Orange County performances. After ascertaining the 
letter was genuine -- not something my associates had faked on joke shop 
stationery -- the next step was figuring out what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, I was proud and kind of humbled to warrant his notice, but I also felt 
somewhat of a traitor to my craft. Hasn't one of this world's longest wars been 
the 50-year brawl between Sinatra and the press? Isn't it practically a 
journalistic badge of honor to have caught a punch from Frank or one of his 
underlings? 
</P>
<P>
And long before becoming a writer, I felt an antipathy towards him. In the 
Us-versus-Them schism that so marked the '60s, Sinatra was most certainly Them. 
Like the oldsters who had castigated him and his music 20 years earlier, 
Sinatra dismissed the rock music I loved, calling it the product of "cretinous 
goons" and "a rancid-smelling aphrodisiac." This from the man whose albums were 
probably the greatest seduction tool since the advent of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, his whole brand of music seemed like a creaking sham, nearly 
corporate with its glib tunesmiths, glossy orchestrations, and Sinatra's smug 
delivery. In both film and music, the whole notion of the groomed, classy 
"star" he represented was falling by the wayside, replaced by brooding young 
minds who, for better or worse, were doing their own thing. 
</P>
<P>
Even Elvis seemed hopelessly old-fashioned in the '60s. After Dylan and the 
Beatles, artists had to be self-contained -- writing their own songs and 
strumming their own instruments -- and (so we imagined) untouched by the 
show-biz bull epitomized by Las Vegas and its greatest gaseous star, Sinatra. 
When we did look to the past, it wasn't to his crafted wares but to the raw 
loam of Robert Johnson, Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams and Howlin' Wolf. If we 
wanted jazz, it would be the consuming fire of a Billie Holiday or Charlie 
Parker, not the Chairman of the Board or whichever of his countless nicknames 
he was answering to then. 
</P>
<P>
As the decade progressed, Sinatra's offstage actions weren't any too endearing 
to youth either. 
</P>
<P>
When a generation took to the streets to protest an immoral war and the mailed 
hand of "law and order," Sinatra abandoned his New Deal-New Frontier past and 
chummied up to Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon, whom -- spiffy library or no -- 
some of us still regard as traitors to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
His shift to the right, some tomes have speculated, was due to Bobby Kennedy's 
investigation of Sinatra's mob buddies. Stories linking him to underworld 
figures continued to surface in the late '60s, and, until the release of "The 
Godfather" in 1972, the Vietnam generation wasn't as enamored of mobsters as 
earlier generations had been -- they seemed too much like the government we 
were stuck with. 
</P>
<P>
So, the hell with Sinatra, I figured, as I cultivated holes in my faded jeans 
and hunkered down with pretentious Jethro Tull concept albums. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent O.C. appearance, singer Michelle Shocked remarked that "political 
correctness has been a serious social disease for the last several years," and 
ain't it the truth? 
</P>
<P>
Sinatra may have done little to redeem himself ethically since the '60s. 
Indeed, he's since made unrepentant money-runs to South Africa's Sun City, and 
Kitty Kelley's 1986 biography, "His Way," smudged out a damning portrait of 
Sinatra as a venal bully. 
</P>
<P>
But even if every accusation of moral blindness in Kelley's book were true, 
both it and many in my generation have been equally blind to the blatant, 
obvious humanity of the man. 
</P>
<P>
Obvious? French singer Charles Aznavour had this to say about Sinatra: "It is 
impossible to sing like a saint and be a bad man." 
</P>
<P>
The grand effort of Sinatra's 74 years wasn't duking cameramen, bedding 
starlets or flinging his arms around politicos and "made men." It was what he 
did behind a microphone, and the humanity revealed there, the emotion and 
revelatory genius of his talent, is one of the great treasures of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Rock impresario Bill Graham once said that the two greatest performances he had 
seen in his life had been by Frank Sinatra and Jimi Hendrix, and the galactic 
distance I once perceived between those two performers doesn't seem so great to 
me now. It was easier, perhaps, to recognize the genius in a pioneer like 
Hendrix, to applaud the courage in pushing a musical form into vast uncharted 
regions. But it is no less brilliant or brave to work within an established 
form, looking inward to the innumerable instants and delicate gradients that 
can render a work unique. In both, ultimately, it isn't the form but the 
emotion shared that matters. 
</P>
<P>
It took seeing Sinatra live for me to catch on to that. I went to review his 
1984 Pacific Amphitheatre show and really hoped he'd fall right on his aging 
schnoz. Instead I was practically moved to tears by the warmth and artistry of 
his voice, the nearly unmatched way he could finesse a melody, the way his 
phrasing burnished hidden facets in every syllable it touched. It was a very 
giving performance, showing more commitment to craft than most performers half 
his age could muster, and it was deeply human, forcing the recognition that 
he's felt the same hurts and joys as the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
The times I've seen him since then, including a thoroughly magical 1986 Pacific 
show, have only deepened that impression. Even without considering that his 
voice is supposedly on the wane, it's a frightening lot of talent for one man 
to carry around. No wonder he seemed so cocky in his glory days. 
</P>
<P>
While not the mercurial creator that Billie Holiday (whom he's cited as his 
biggest vocal influence) was, he also was an innovator. Just as the films had 
allowed actors to scale down the broad gestures of the stage, so the sensitive 
microphones of the late '30s allowed singers to achieve a vocal intimacy that 
was previously impossible outside of the shower. Bing Crosby was the first 
great beneficiary of that technology, but it was Sinatra's '40s recordings 
which made that intimacy truly intimate. He was able to bring new shadings and 
nuance to a lyric, and it was like he was crooning them directly into the ear 
of his fans. 
</P>
<P>
To understand why Sinatra doesn't love the press, listen to his daring early 
'40s Columbia records, and then read some of the dismissive comments of the 
press of the day, including: "Listening to The Voice is like being stroked by a 
hand covered with cold cream" and the writer who prescribed "Sinatra-ceptives" 
for the "emotionally unstable females who paraded naked and unashamed for the 
drooling, crooning, goonish syllables of a man who looked like a second-string 
basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
By the time they caught on that he was more than just the focus of girls' 
wartime sexual frustrations, he had moved on. 
</P>
<P>
Other singers have tried to claim "My Way," but few people living have actually 
had their way as often as Sinatra. How many guys have hobnobbed with with 
F.D.R., Kennedy, Reagan, Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner not to mention Sam 
Giacana and Lucky Luciano? 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts his failed relationship with Gardner was the one great 
exception to Sinatra's getting his way, and it may not be coincidental that 
blue then entered as a strong color on his song canvases. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes there is a change in people you can sense in their work, like the way 
the light went out of Clark Gable's performances after he lost Carole Lombard. 
In Sinatra's case, his unhappiness enriched his art. Much like the way Eskimos 
have scores of words to describe the minute variations in snow and ice, so 
despair and loneliness came to be expressed in his voice in a breathtakingly 
realized vocabulary of phrasing and vocal shadings. Just listen to his "In the 
Wee Small Hours" and "Only the Lonely." 
</P>
<P>
All of this speculation about the motivations behind that voice, is, of course, 
only speculation. Which in itself is a pretty good reason for him to be honked 
off at the press and sundry. Great art is supposed to inspire, and here he has 
been lobbing perfect passes with his voice for half a century, and rather than 
catch the damn ball and run with it (starting our own Rat Packs or whatever), 
all we can think to do is to continue to watch and weigh his every move. 
</P>
<P>
If he has been imperfect in his private life (while also not forgetting his 
many impetuous acts of pure generosity), who's to blame him? He has been more 
perfect in his art than most, and was that enough for us? 
</P>
<P>
In 1963 he told a Playboy interviewer, "Whatever has been said about me 
personally is unimportant. When I sing, I believe, I'm honest." 
</P>
<P>
I'll buy that, and if he ever records another album (his most recent was 1984's 
"L.A. Is My Lady," hardly a worthy farewell), I'll buy that too. And he's 
welcome to write me anytime.

FULLERTON EXHIBITS BRITISH CRAFTS THAT STAYED LOYAL WITHOUT STAYING FRUMPY

<P>
If the words "British crafts" came up in conversation, you'd think of: a) 
hand-crocheted tea cozies; b) Wedgewood porcelain; c) hand-printed floral 
wallpaper by the Victorian firm of Morris and Co.; d) the Omega Workshops of 
the Bloomsbury group; or e) a chair made of stacks of glass shards? 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 130 years ago, William Morris, the 19th-Century reformer, poet and 
designer, decried the ugliness of manufactured goods and founded a company to 
turn out handmade furniture, wallpaper, textiles and other items, in simple yet 
attractive styles that harked back to medieval examples. On a much smaller 
scale for a few years between 1910 and 1920, the painters of the Omega 
Workshops turned out vividly patterned home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent decades a sizable contingent of British artisans finally cast 
aside lingering traces of the old, frumpy "tea cozy" design mentality. They are 
producing pieces with a genuinely contemporary spirit that are nonetheless 
ineffably British. In "Contrasts: Diversity in Contemporary British Crafts," at 
the Muckenthaler Cultural Center through Oct. 28, the Crafts Council of England 
and Wales has assembled furniture, vessels, jewelry, hand-bound books, textiles 
and other works in wood, metal, glass and ceramics, all made during the '70s 
and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Crafts materials seem to respond sympathetically to the deep-rooted literary 
sense of the British, as well as to the keen handling of line they have 
traditionally shown in typography design, engraving and etching. Even the 
national virtue of "making do" -- in this case, using humble castoff materials 
-- results in some delightful pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the work on view tends to reflect either a fondness for muted, 
earth-tone colors and imperfect, deliberately unlovely form or a taste for 
astringently elegant simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the niftiest pieces in the show tell a story or set a scene. Cobbled 
together from bits of scrap tin, Andrew Hazell's "Eggs and Beans" offers the 
sight of a tall, plain-faced woman with a tatty blue robe and spindly legs 
standing at a stove, where she grimly supervises a mess of beans (a red smear 
in a pot) and a frying egg. 
</P>
<P>
Carved in wood, Paul Spooner's "Five Artists Reflect on Their Waning Powers" is 
an ironic tableau in which a group of goateed codgers scratch their heads, 
gesture and look into space over blank sheets of paper. Below the long table 
they share are the spool-like cogs of a mysterious stationary machine, clearly 
a metaphor for inactive brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lane's chair made of glass shards -- stacks of irregular sheets of glass 
skewered on metal bars to form legs, arms and seat back -- is surely the 
flashiest piece on view. Other pieces of furniture, like Erik de Graaf's 
tightly compact "box chair" with a back that adjusts by fitting into one of a 
row of slots, are fine examples of smartly clean-lined, functional design. 
</P>
<P>
An economical, understated sense of line also informs an elegant pair of 
feldspar and clay jugs by Walter Keeler, a steel bowl with a serpentine handle 
by Ivan Smith and a pumpkin shape made of sagging, loosely gathered strips of 
metal by Amanda Bright. Horizontal steel bars lace through the undulating 
wooden panels of a folding screen by Rodney Wales, called "Sine Screen" after a 
ratio used in trigonometry. 
</P>
<P>
The small glass pieces in the show are uniformly disappointing -- studio glass 
has only a brief lineage in contemporary British crafts -- and the few jewelry 
pieces tend to be disappointingly fey. But the lovingly detailed examples of 
one-of-a-kind bookbinding could have issued from no other land. Incidentally, 
if you fancy things British, be advised: This exhibit heralds the arrival of 
"Festival of Britain -- Orange County 1990," which gathers steam in mid-October 
with exhibits, performances and other events in several county venues.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: JOEY'S BAR-B-Q GIVES DINERS A GOOD RIBBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Adam lost his, mankind has been searching for the perfect rib. 
</P>
<P>
Although carnivorous perfection may never be achieved in this world, Joey's 
Bar-B-Q is definitely a serious contender. 
</P>
<P>
In short, this place is rib heaven. 
</P>
<P>
While there are several dishes on the menu worthy of mention, the ribs are the 
hero at this country-style restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Served dripping in a sweet, tangy barbecue sauce, the meat, whether it be pork 
baby back or the larger beef ribs, is so tender it almost falls off the bone 
and melts in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The various rib platters, moderately priced at $8.95 to $13.95, are laden with 
enough meat to satisfy anyone. 
</P>
<P>
And the story could end here -- except for the rest of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
The country sausage ($8.95) is made on the premises. The long, thick links are 
not too spicy, are extremely lean and very tasty. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecue chicken ($7.95) and ham ($8.95) dinners come in large portions. 
All plates come with either a baked potato, baked yam with marshmallows, french 
fries or veg-a-bob and a choice of baked beans or corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner menu also features steaks ranging in price from $10.95 for a top 
sirloin to $14.95 for a filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
For those who can't seem to make up their minds, Joey's also offers a huge 
plate called The Works ($11.95), which includes ham, sliced beef, chicken, beef 
ribs and a slice of the country sausage. 
</P>
<P>
The lunch menu holds a variety of sandwiches, including a barbecue pork 
sandwich served on a fresh roll stuffed with thick yet tender slices of pork. A 
variety of domestic and imported beers and house wines are available. 
</P>
<P>
Country-Western is the main theme of Joey's Bar-B-Q, from the wooden plank 
floors and weathered wagon decorating the restaurant to the down-home country 
singers featured six nights a week. Monday is Joey's day of rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey's Bar-B-Q, 1339 N. East St., Anaheim. Open Tuesday through Thursday, 11 
a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., and 
Sunday, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 991-9040. JAMES M. GOMEZ

King Neptune's Seafood Restaurant and Nautical Museum, 17115 Pacific Coast 
Highway, Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Dinners are served after 5. (213) 592-4878. 
Started as a place for the ex-Marine owner to display his huge collection of 
nautical/military artifacts, this bar-restaurant-museum is one of the least 
pretentious, and most bizarre, places in Orange County or maybe anywhere. Basic 
seafood, like the ambience, comes in generous portions. KENT ZELAS

Cafe Capistrano, 31752 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Open daily, 7 
a.m. to 4 p.m. (714) 493-0607. A cross between a truck stop and a country 
kitchen, this place exudes the kind of small-town, Western flair that attracts 
customers with cowboy boots and turquoise jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to sit by the window for a view of the mission and great people 
watching. And ask for the Capistrano Omelette: peanut butter, apricot-pineapple 
preserves and bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Las Barcas Mexican Restaurant, 21032 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open daily, 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 536-2616. Oversized portions, the hodgepodge decor and 
a colorful variety of local folk make this tiny eatery a beachside winner. The 
food is good and cheap, featuring ranchero-covered burritos, fresh snapper 
tacos and homemade tortilla chips. Be prepared to take out, though, there's 
always a crowd. AMY McCURDY

Mondays and Tuesdays till 7 p.m., Wednesdays through Saturdays till 8 p.m., 
Sundays till 4:30 p.m. (714) 498-6379. Huge helpings, continual coffee refills,

limited to, 20 different omelet combos help make this the brunch house of 
choice in South County. LAURA MICHAELIS

Several Orange County restaurants currently shine in the national/international 
spotlight. The Aug. 31 issue of Wine Spectator, which unveils the worldwide 
1990 grand awards for restaurants with great cellars, cites Five Crowns in 
Corona del Mar and Mr. Stox in Anaheim. Both restaurants have been grand-award 
winners since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in the August issue of Bon Appetit, the "Western Insider" column features 
Kachina restaurant in Laguna Beach. It calls owner David Wilhelm, who recently 
opened Bistro 201 in Irvine and will debut Barbacoa in Newport Beach this fall, 
"one busy restaurateur." 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County restaurants received top evaluations in the new, second 
edition of Gault Millau's "The Best of L.A.," which reviews 1,300 restaurants 
in southern California, from Santa Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rated on a scale of 1 to 20, Antoine at Le Meridien in Newport Beach received a 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dining Room of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Dana Point; Pavilion in the Four 
Seasons Hotel, Newport Beach, and Pascal, Newport Beach, each rated a 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Millau guides to fine dining have directed connoisseurs abroad for years. 
Recently the guides expanded to focus on specific areas of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pascal Olhats, by the way, will demonstrate his cuisine Sunday, Sept. 9, at the 
Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center in Costa Mesa. From 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 
p.m., he'll create several different French dishes from a menu for a black-tie 
dinner at 7 that evening. Cost of the demo is $45; the dinner, $125. 
</P>
<P>
The menu will include poached oysters with spinach and shallot cream, crayfish 
pastry with lobster bisque, rack of baby lamb with cepes and garlic in white 
wine sauce, plus a fruit gratin. 
</P>
<P>
Five different reserve wines will complement the courses. The Mondavi center is 
at 1570 Scenic Ave., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-4510. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH

<P>
* Disneyland, 1313 N. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 999-4565. Hours vary. $$ 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland feed more mouths than any 
local restaurant could ever hope to, yet their food concessions get 
surprisingly little notice. With regard to Disneyland, it's not surprising: You 
are a captive audience there, and the food is mediocre at best. Knott's Chicken 
Dinner Restaurant fares much better. You don't even have to enter the park to 
eat there. For $7.95, hungry families can get individual dinners consisting of 
a rhubarb appetizer, a mixed green salad, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and 
country gravy, fresh cabbage seasoned with ham, buttermilk biscuits and a 
choice of pie. Take that, Mickey! 
</P>
<P>
* Soup Exchange, 151 E. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 992-5522. Open

<P>
Eat soup and live longer at these two emporia for our favorite comfort food. 
Soup Exchange is the slicker and less expensively packaged of the two, a soup 
and salad bar with such extras as frozen yogurt, muffins and a nacho bar. It's 
all you can eat and every man for himself. Salmagundi is homier and even a bit 
trendy, with such exotic soups as tortilla, wild rice and country cheddar; they 
change daily. Salmagundi also has a dessert bar where you can indulge in such 
goodies as trifle, apple brown betty and chocolate mousse.

Saturdays to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
One of the best small Chinese restaurants in the heavily ethnic San Gabriel 
Valley, 3-6-9 Shanghai has opened this storefront sister in an Anaheim shopping 
mall, bringing nearly all of its popular dishes. Handmade breads and savory 
dumpling preparations excel here along with such exotic cold appetizers as 
tea-smoked chicken and braised baby bamboo. The restaurant is cheap and basic; 
tell them to tread lightly on the MSG. The steamed pork with rice is a 
revelation.

9 p.m.; weekends from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, it seems, has his secret Mexican haunt, where the chilis are hotter 
or the tortillas fresher. El Ranchito is the place for carnitas, chunked pork 
marinated in lemon and garlic, and for some of the most toothsome handmade 
tortillas in the area. Larry Cano's Manana specializes in fajitas, giant 
portions that easily feed two, loaded with trimmed meats, red and yellow 
peppers, tomatoes and carmelized onion. Best of all is La Salsa, a humble food 
stand dispensing antojitos, soft tacos, quesadillas and Mexican sandwiches. 
Meats here are impeccable, accompaniments rapturous.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;

<P>
RIDGELINE PROTECTION DECISION IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an emotional public hearing marked by property owners' threats of 
lawsuits, the City Council voted to postpone for 30 days a decision on a 
proposed ridgeline protection ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is intended to protect undeveloped ridgelines throughout 
the city, has provoked the wrath of hilltop property owners, who have been told 
by city officials that they may not be able to build upon their lots. The 
neighborhoods of Bear Brand Ranch and Monarch Point could be especially 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
As it is now written, the proposed ordinance would ban development within 300 
feet of ridgelines that are in "view of scenic highways," such as Pacific Coast 
Highway or Crown Valley Parkway. It also would place some restrictions on 
development within 500 feet of such ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
In Bear Brand Ranch alone, 40 to 50 lots worth up to $40 million could be 
affected if the ordinance is passed, developer Robert O'Hill told the council 
Tuesday night. City officials have warned that Laguna Niguel could be sued if 
the properties are rendered undevelopable by the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said the move to preserve the ridgelines, at first well 
received, now has generated bad blood in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the most insidious type of initiative here," said Monarch Point 
resident Cassie De Young. "There is no question that it's unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The city staff had recommended that the council allow officials 30 days to 
explore what City Manager Tim Casey called the "extraordinarily complex" fiscal 
and legal impact of the proposed ordinance. The council's options are limited 
because the proposed law was drafted as an initiative, signed by residents, and 
now must be either approved as is by the council or voted on by the community. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they have been inundated by calls from worried 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I've kept a very copious count and I think we've counted 49 threats since I 
started answering my phone on Thursday," Councilman Paul Christiansen said. 
Councilman Thomas W. Wilson added: "This issue has definitely escalated to a 
level above and beyond our young city's expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Patricia Bates, who owns a lot in Monarch Point, and Councilman James 
Krembas abstained from the 3-0 vote to postpone a decision. 
</P>
<P>
During almost two hours of public testimony, 21 people spoke against the 
ordinance and only one in its defense. Some who criticized the proposal were 
petition signers who now say they did not understand the implications of the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the proposed ordinance a potential "catastrophe," Bear Brand Ranch lot 
owner Fred Burbank said it would "wipe out the rights of the people who own 
these lots." 
</P>
<P>
"To even give this the legitimacy of study is absurd," Burbank said. "It should 
be flushed early." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Taylor, chairman of committee backing the ordinance, said the group 
expected "heavy-duty opposition" against the initiative, but not from 
individual lot owners. While conceding that he does not understand all the 
legal aspects of the ordinance, Taylor said it was not intended to halt 
construction by individual parcel owners. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart bleeds for these folks," he said after the meeting. "If I had been in 
Bear Brand Ranch and . . . it was going to affect me, I'd be the loudest voice 
there." 
</P>
<P>
A separate ridgeline-protection and hillside-development ordinance has been 
prepared by a city consultant and is being considered now by city planners. 
That proposal has different setback requirements and would allow officials to 
consider each development proposal individually. 
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor, who considers such allowances to be "loopholes," predicts that 
the intention of the initiative eventually will be clarified and residents will 
again rally behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people will realize what the intent is," he said. "We don't want 
to condemn anything. We want to protect the ridgelines." LESLIE EARNEST

GAIDO STATUS UNCLEAR DESPITE COURT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a court order saying Mary Ann Gaido should be seated on the City 
Council, it remained unclear Wednesday whether she will be allowed to take 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is meeting today at 2 p.m. in a special session to discuss 
Friday's order by Orange County Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore that Gaido 
be seated and what effect the ruling may have on the city's complicated 
election laws. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door discussion, the council is expected to decide whether it 
should proceed with an appeal of the ruling, cancel a November special election 
called to fill the council seat left vacant by Sally Anne Sheridan's elevation 
to mayor, or seat Gaido, City Manager Paul O. Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the council's decision is critical because today is the last day 
to remove items from the Nov. 6 ballot before it goes to press. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido has already made two attempts to take office since the court order was 
issued but has been turned away from City Hall both times by City Atty. John L. 
Fellows. Brady said Fellows immediately filed notice that he was going to 
appeal Moore's court order. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido's attorney, Christopher Mears, is expected today to seek another order 
from Moore, which would allow Gaido to be seated until Fellows' appeal is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Moore's) ruling from the bench is effective until a court of appeal 
says to unseat Mary Ann Gaido," Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido's lawsuit against the city, filed in July, was the second in as many 
years over city election laws approved by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under those election laws, a special election to fill a council seat left 
vacant by a member who is elevated to mayor must be held if 7% of the city's 
registered voters sign a petition. If no petition is filed, the third-highest 
vote-getter in a council election is automatically seated. Gaido finished third 
in the June election behind William A. (Art) Bloomer and Barry J. Hammond in a 
race for two seats, but subsequently a special-election petition was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said the confusion over whether to seat Gaido could have been avoided 
had the previous City Council attempted to resolve inconsistencies in the 
election laws, which were pointed out by a recently settled lawsuit against 
former Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, who was challenged as the third-highest 
vote-getter in the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
"The last council didn't deal with this responsibly, and now we have all these 
people who acted on their decisions," Sheridan said. "I told the whole world 
back in 1988 that this system (of allowing a special election) was crazy, and 
now we have to go back to court to get a reading on the law." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's November ballot contains two measures that would repeal the election 
laws enacted in 1988. Measure E would repeal the directly elected mayor process 
and Measure F would repeal the special-election process. WENDY PAULSON

1,000 HOMES TO TEST CURBSIDE RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously this week to begin a six-month experimental 
recycling program at about 1,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The $2,480 monthly cost will be shared by every home and business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A staff report on that cost-sharing plan will be presented to the City Council 
on Sept. 18, Assistant City Manager George Scarborough said. A public hearing 
will be held at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The curbside recycling program, which is also being tested in San Clemente and 
Dana Point, is San Juan Capistrano's first attempt to comply with Assembly Bill 
939, which contains specific guidelines to reduce the amount of waste headed 
for landfills. The bill requires all cities and counties to adopt a recycling 
plan to reduce their solid waste by 25% in 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 homes to be served in the experimental phase include the areas of 
Harbor Lane Homes and Troy Homes. The program is expected to begin Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The recyclable materials will be collected and then marketed by Solag Disposal 
Inc., which holds the refuse contracts for all three cities. Solag Disposal 
will collect the materials on the same day the existing trash pickup is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Materials to be collected in three bins include newspaper, glass containers, 
metal cans and plastics. Under the terms of the contract, Solag Disposal will 
provide its customers with the bins, Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of six months, the city will reassess the program and decide whether 
to continue, Scarborough said. LEN HALL

CITY TO TAKE STAND ON PARKWAY TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are about to unveil a new ordinance intended to clear any 
confusion about who owns the trees on city parkways: the city does. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which was several years in the making, gives the city the first 
and last word on decisions to plant or replace trees and to remove any 
illegally planted trees or shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, city workers chopped down three dozen 70-year-old oak and 
ash trees on the north side of Broadway in Anaheim, angering residents, some of 
whom have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The residents formed Broadway and Area Residents, an 85-member group that 
succeeded in saving the trees on the south side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher K. Jarvi, director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department, 
said the ordinance probably will be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't please everyone. . . . You have people who want their tree taken 
out, and you have others who want one put in. You have some people who want 
their tree trimmed four times a year, and you have people who don't want it 
trimmed at all." 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the ordinance will require that any appeals be made to the parks 
director, who may consult an outside arborist. In two meetings with community 
members, residents had asked that the appeals be made instead through a 
citizens committee.

OIL, DETERGENT LEAK CLEANED UP BY BOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Booms that were towed by several boats swept up 11 gallons of oil and liquid 
detergent that leaked from an offshore drilling platform Wednesday morning 
after a pump malfunctioned, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One gallon of crude oil and 10 gallons of a soap-type cleaner spilled about 
6:15 a.m. from a Shell Oil Co. platform known as Emmy that lies about 1 1/2 
miles from shore, north of Golden West Street and Pacific Coast Highway, said 
Mark Bodenbender, a spokesman for the Huntington Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said an alarm malfunctioned and set off a pump, spilling the mess into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We're investigating what really failed. It could have been the alarm on the 
pump that turned the pump on. Or it could have been the pump itself," said Hart 
Wurner of Shell Oil. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second leak at the same platform in a week, but Shell spokesmen said 
the two were not related. The first occurred last Thursday and was about the 
same size, city officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

<P>
NEW POLICE PISTOLS TO BE PAID FOR BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to pay for police officers' 
semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief authorized use of the 9-millimeter guns in October, 1989, but 
officers who wanted them were required to buy them on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Standard issue equipment has been .357 revolvers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that obviously we would have liked to have done back in 
October of last year, but the finances were not available then," Tustin Police 
Capt. Steve Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will purchase the automatic pistols, holsters and ammunition pouches 
for officers who want them and reimburse the 45 officers who have already 
bought the weapons. Total cost will be between $60,000 and $65,000, Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The semiautomatic weapon increases the officer's firepower, because the 
individual officer armed with one would normally carry 45 rounds -- 15 in the 
clip and two additional clips. The .357 pistol carries six in the cylinder and 
the officer would normally carry 12 more rounds in his ammunition pouches. 
</P>
<P>
Most other police departments in the county pay for officers' semiautomatic 
weapons, which load faster and smoother than revolvers, said Tustin City 
Councilman Jim Potts, a sergeant in the Irvine Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Potts suggested the policy after a resident wrote him a letter, contending that 
making officers pay for their weapons is like hiring a secretary and making her 
buy her own typewriter.

SANTA ANA: ALUMNA, 91, HELPS MARK COLLEGE'S 75TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black and red balloons soared into the hot sky. The Santa Ana High School Band 
struck up "When the Saints Go Marching In." And 91-year-old Martha Ehlen, class 
of 1919, proudly raised the state flag in front of Rancho Santiago College's 
Administration Building. 
</P>
<P>
With this ceremony, the college on Wednesday morning launched a yearlong 
observance of its 75th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Originally called Santa Ana Junior College, the institution was founded in 
1915. It is the second oldest college in Orange County; Fullerton College, the 
oldest, opened in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
For alumni and civic officials, the Rancho Santiago anniversary ceremony on 
Wednesday triggered a series of remembrances. World War II veterans recalled 
the bare, sparse look of the campus in the 1940s, when many structures were 
Quonset huts. College district Trustee Shirley Ralston recalled the ruckus 
among some alumni in the 1980s when the Board of Trustees changed the college's 
name to Rancho Santiago to reflect a service area bigger than just the city of 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the remembrances could outstrip Martha Ehlen's recollection of how 
the infant campus looked in 1917, when she entered Santa Ana Junior College 
after graduating from Orange High School. The college was only two years old in 
1917, but Ehlen said it was already a superior place to prepare for transfer to 
a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely wonderful instruction," she said. "Every remembrance I have of 
Santa Ana Junior College is one of gratitude and happiness. I got such 
wonderful instruction here that when I transferred to (UC) Berkeley, I was able 
to graduate from there in just a year and a half," Ehlen recalled. "And I 
graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude (with highest honors)." 
</P>
<P>
After getting her degree from UC Berkeley, Ehlen taught at Fullerton College. 
One of her most notable students, she said, was Richard M. Nixon -- a young lad 
from Yorba Linda. "Oh, he was a fine student, a straight-A student, and I 
remember that he played the violin," Ehlen said. "I've always liked him, but, 
of course, I'm a Republican." Ehlen said she taught Nixon in her Latin I and 
Latin II classes. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlen, who still lives in Orange, received a standing ovation from the outdoor 
crowd of about 100 persons when she was introduced for her flag-raising duties 
at the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
College officials said the next major event commemorating Rancho Santiago's 
75th anniversary will be a homecoming pep rally and potluck dinner at 4 p.m. 
Oct. 27 on the Santa Ana campus. BILL BILLITER

'SPOON' HAS BEEN A BULL AT HOUSTON 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spoooooooon. Hey, Chuck Weatherspoon, the eyes of Texas are upon you, good 
buddy. 
</P>
<P>
After a season-long ban, Texans -- heck, folks nationwide -- can catch you and 
those high-scoring Houston Cougars on TV this year. Tough break about missing a 
bowl game again, though. NCAA sanctions can be rough. 
</P>
<P>
But never mind that stuff, Spoon, tell us about all those yards you've gained 
as Houston's one-and-only super back? 
</P>
<P>
Earl Campbell and Eric Dickerson never had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons 
as collegians. Can you become the fourth running back in Southwest Conference 
history to do it? 
</P>
<P>
How does that stumpy body roll over those hulking defenders, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
And about that Heisman Trophy -- can you win it like your teammate Andre Ware 
did last season? 
</P>
<P>
Do tell, Spoon, do tell. 
</P>
<P>
Please, a pause for reflection from the man whose name will echo into the 
Astrodome rafters on Saturday afternoons this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Weatherspoon heard an Astrodome crowd erupt in a chorus of 
Spoooooooon, it scared him. 
</P>
<P>
A nervous freshman from La Habra High School, Weatherspoon whispered into a 
teammate's ear, "Did I do something wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
He thought he was getting booooooooed for the first time, in his first college 
game. 
</P>
<P>
When the teammate set Weatherspoon straight, the young running back smiled to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," he thought. "That's all right." 
</P>
<P>
The Houston media guide lists Weatherspoon, a senior, at 5 feet 7. That's a 
lie. He's closer to 5-10. It also says he weighs 210 pounds, which is what John 
Jenkins, in his first season as Cougar coach, wishes Weatherspoon weighed. He's 
closer to 220. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a man Weatherspoon's size run, defenders draped over him trying to 
drag him down, inspires all sorts of analogies with bulls -- mechanical and 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
A Texas sportswriter recently asked Weatherspoon the following question: 
</P>
<P>
"You know they closed down the mechanical bull at Gilley's, you gonna take it's 
place?" 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon shook his head, spit tobacco juice into a paper cup, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a wild, loose bull out on the field," Weatherspoon said. 
</P>
<P>
To hear the stories, you'd think Weatherspoon dragged the entire Southwest 
Conference on his back for each of the 2,150 yards he has gained in his career. 
</P>
<P>
That's not so. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon's Pop Warner days appear to be the source of current hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Weatherspoon bought a weightlifting set for his three sons, Anthony, 
Linton and Chuck, when the three were youngsters. Chuck, in particular, lifted 
with great gusto. While he never sprouted like Anthony, who played at Colorado, 
or Linton, also at Houston, he developed enormous muscles in his legs and upper 
torso. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a Pop Warner game, Weatherspoon was carrying the ball when a defender 
jumped on his back. Another climbed aboard, then another, but Weatherspoon kept 
running with "a whole bunch of them trying to get me down." 
</P>
<P>
At La Habra, where he rushed for more than 4,000 yards, Weatherspoon was 
alternately referred to as a frigate and a battleship. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he resembles no one as much as Robert Newhouse, a stocky fullback with 
the Cougars from 1969-71 and later with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"People bounce off him like in a little pinball machine," said Newhouse, a 
commentator on the Cougars' radio network. "We're built about the same, but I 
don't think I was as strong as him." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon tries to hit the defenders before they hit him, which may account 
for the pinball effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang tackling," he said, is the only sure way to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon was recruited by Houston before the Cougars hit it big, when fans 
still remembered Newhouse as the school's greatest running back. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Yeoman, who had coached Cougar teams good and bad since 1962, brought 
Weatherspoon to Houston to play a rather straightforward brand of football. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman resigned in 1986 after going 1-9, his second consecutive losing season. 
Worse, two former players accused Yeoman and his staff of paying players and 
allowing them to play while ineligible. Following the 1985 season, 12 players 
flunked out of school and 10 of 28 recruits from 1985 were ruled scholastically 
ineligible. Soon after, the NCAA started looking into the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pardee, ex-Chicago Bear and Washington Redskin coach, took over in 1987, 
hiring John Jenkins, an offensive coordinator with the Houston Gamblers who 
knew how to spruce up the Cougars' sagging offense. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee allowed Jenkins, who was tinkering with the run-and-shoot offense, to 
indulge himself. It took awhile to get the thing revved up, but once they did, 
it worked with ridiculous ease. 
</P>
<P>
Last season came the big breakthrough -- quarterback Andre Ware threw short 
passes on almost every down, wide receiver Manny Hazard grabbed Ware's throws 
and Weatherspoon ran through gaping holes when defenses were sure the Cougars 
were passing. 
</P>
<P>
Among the numbers the Cougars posted on their way to a 9-2 record were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weatherspoon averaged 9.6 yards a carry, breaking the NCAA mark of 9.4 held 
by Greg Pruitt of Oklahoma. His all-purpose total of 2,391 yards broke by 284 
yards the 25-year-old SWC record held by Donny Anderson of Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ware passed for 517 yards in little more than a half of the Cougars' 95-21 
wipeout of Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A team scoring average of 53.5 points, including four games of more than 
60. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the announcement of Ware as the Heisman Trophy winner came on the 
afternoon of yet another Cougar rout, this one, 64-0, over Rice. 
</P>
<P>
On a muggy summer afternoon in Houston, with the beginning of the season still 
a month away and Jenkins the Cougars' new coach, Weatherspoon mulled over the 
numbers and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that neither Campbell, a Heisman winner at Texas, nor Dickerson, who 
was part of SMU's Pony Express, had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon also knows that teammates have not won consecutive Heismans since 
Doc Blanchard ran inside and Glenn Davis outside for Army in 1945 and '46, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The Heisman Trophy," he said "that doesn't faze me at all. It's nice to be 
recognized, but I just want to go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame him. Above all else, the run and shoot is fun. Fun to play and 
fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fans stay until the end of the game, no matter the score, because you 
never know what could happen," Weatherspoon said. "It's too bad people didn't 
get to see us on TV last year." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars were banned from live TV and bowl games last year, as part of NCAA 
probation in the wake of Yeoman's turbulent final seasons at Houston. This 
season, the Cougars are back on TV (they make their return Sept. 13 against 
Texas Tech on ESPN), but still cannot play in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"It ain't gonna be my goal to win the Heisman," Weatherspoon said. "(But) it's 
a honor to have people know how good the Houston Cougars are. It'll be nice. 
People will see us on TV and say, 'I like Houston. They're pretty good.' Before 
they only got to read about us."

BLAISE SETTING IOWA STATE AFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
AMES, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to Iowa State University, birthplace of the computer and home to the 
nation's only college football scrimmages frequently buzzed by model airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it here that former Cyclone Coach Jim Criner threatened to bring a 
shotgun to practice when the diving planes plunged a little too close to a 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Criner never took target practice, so the planes were soaring again when Iowa 
State Coach Jim Walden watched the Cyclones go through their first scrimmage of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred feet below the air show, Blaise Bryant took a handoff from 
quarterback Chris Pedersen and dipped and ducked through the sea of red 
jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryant has more on his mind than tacklers. After being knocked out of 
bounds, he scrambles up and looks skyward. You never know if one of the 
kamikaze planes might try a late hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy around here," Bryant said. "You never know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Nope, you never really know what to expect at an Iowa State practice. You never 
know what, or who, might show up. 
</P>
<P>
Take last August, for instance. Remember that dude from Southern California, 
the one dressed in surfer pants and T-shirts and who had that hairstyle that 
went every which way? 
</P>
<P>
Walden, in desperate need of a running game, gave the guy the ball and watched 
him go. 
</P>
<P>
And Blaise Xavier Bryant never stopped. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game, he ran for 213 yards and two touchdowns against Ohio 
University. It was the first time a Big Eight back cracked 200 yards in his 
debut. Heisman Trophy winners Barry Sanders, Mike Rozier and Johnny Rodgers 
hadn't come close. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 6 feet 1 and 200 pounds, went on to break nine Iowa State season 
rushing and scoring records last year. 
</P>
<P>
His 1,516 yards rushing ranked fourth in the nation and first in the 
rushing-rich Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
He was a third-team All-American, named Big Eight newcomer of the year and is 
the leading returning rusher in the nation. He and the Cyclones open their 
season Saturday, playing host to Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's statistics and potential have NFL scouts rating him among the top five 
players in the nation this season. He has been mentioned as a Heisman Trophy 
candidate, even though he says his chances of winning it are "slim and none." 
</P>
<P>
His play and personality have made him a celebrity in Ames, a city of about 
46,000 in central Iowa. During a recent trip to a shopping mall to buy shoes, 
he was stopped half a dozen times for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"I always pay for everything with cash," Bryant says. "The minute I write a 
check or pull out my credit card, the person (store clerk) recognizes me." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to go incognito when your name is Blaise. He rolls his eyes when 
telling the story of how he got it. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad thought of it," he said. "He used to tell me that he was sitting in the 
hospital lounge watching a football game while waiting for me to be born. He 
said he heard the announcer say this guy 'scored in a blaze of glory' and 
decided, 'That's it. I'll name him Blaise.' " 
</P>
<P>
So the folks around Ames know there's nothing blase about Blaise. But they 
weren't sure what to think about the 20-year-old surf kid from Huntington Beach 
when he first came to campus. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he was an all-Southern Section tailback as a senior at Cypress High 
School after nearly quitting the team the previous season. Sure, he led the 
nation's junior colleges in rushing while at Golden West College in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But could the guy with the wacky life style and lobster-tail hairstyle cut it 
in the Big Eight? Could he handle life in Ames? 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is a guy who stays a step ahead of fashion trends as well as 
tacklers. He's more comfortable in Ralph Lauren or surfer pants than T-shirts 
and jeans, the norm in Ames. He'll pick up an issue of GQ or In Fashion before 
Sports Illustrated or The Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
And not many Iowa State players can do a barrel roll on a bodyboard like Bryant 
can. When Iowans talk about something that's five to six feet, they're talking 
corn, not waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty liberal, open-minded guy," Bryant said. "I think that's what 
people around here like about me. People around here are afraid to express 
themselves like I do, with the clothes and the haircut, my own creation. And 
then there I am. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take the kid out of California but you can't take the California out 
of the kid. I'm still in love with the water, I always will be." 
</P>
<P>
His popularity in Ames came as no surprise to Ray Shackleford, his coach at 
Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
"Blaise is a pretty infectious guy," Shackleford said. "He's the most 
personable, outgoing guy you could ever meet. 
</P>
<P>
"This summer, he was in here working in our weight room. He's all-Big Eight and 
is being mentioned as a Heisman candidate. But he hasn't changed at all. He's 
still Blaise." 
</P>
<P>
Many in Ames figured Blaise would leave as quickly as he came last spring when 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue opened the upcoming draft to juniors. More than 
30 juniors became eligible, but Bryant stayed in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't given the NFL too much thought," Bryant said. "I wasn't ready to go. 
I only had one year at the Division I level under my belt. I felt I owed it to 
the team and the fans to stay. I had just turned 20 years old. I just wasn't 
ready yet." 
</P>
<P>
What does he think about being projected as a top NFL pick this year? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put much stock in those lists," he said. "Look at a guy like Ickey 
Woods with the Bengals. He was taken in the (late second) round and is doing 
great. Then you look at a (first-round) guy like Brian Bosworth. Where's he?" 
</P>
<P>
Walden met with Bryant after Tagliabue opened up the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to let Blaise know that I wouldn't hold it against him if he decided 
to go pro," Walden said. "I wanted to make sure he knew he was under no 
obligation." 
</P>
<P>
If or when Bryant does turn pro, he wants to play in San Diego. His reason: 
"It's far enough away from home that my mom wouldn't be coming in to clean my 
room all the time. But it's still close enough that I can see my family and 
friends. Besides, there's some great surfing down there." 
</P>
<P>
A Heisman Trophy would no doubt help Bryant's draft status. Several preseason 
magazines have listed him as a candidate, and Walden has begun a grass-roots 
Heisman campaign for his running back. 
</P>
<P>
A few of Walden's campaign speeches: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "You talk about Darian Hagan of Colorado, the Houston media will find 
someone to hype and Notre Dame will stick a player in there. Who's their guy 
with the funny name?" 
</P>
<P>
Uh, Raghib (Rocket) Ismail? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, him. He's run some kickoffs back for touchdowns, but on a performance 
basis, Bryant is the best returning running back in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "If Notre Dame doesn't have someone it's really high on, then Bryant's 
chances improved greatly. Someone needs to call Notre Dame to see if they have 
a Heisman candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I don't want the national hype. I only want this room full of (local 
reporters), and if something happens nationally, fine. But I don't need Sports 
Illustrated or the New York Times. They don't cover Iowa State football, so 
they can stay out of here as far as I'm concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bryant is ready to do the best job he can. All I want him to do is 
what he did last year, and that will take care of the national hype." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "You've got to ask the question, 'What's the Heisman for? If (Bryant) takes 
our team to a higher level, he would have to be the favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's not so sure. He said for him to be a contender, the Cyclones, 6-5 last 
year, will need to reach a bowl game, something they haven't done in 12 years. 
He says he also has to rush for at least 2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy that my name's associated in the same sentence as the Heisman," 
Bryant said. "But we'll let it rest at that. Any time you're messing with 
something that's judged, you can't control it. It (Heisman voting) is 
straight-out politics. And I'm not a very political guy." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches were ready to hand Bryant the bronze statue after his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas Coach Glen Mason, who watched Bryant run for 126 yards and a touchdown 
against the Jayhawks last year, said stopping Bryant "is like hunting a fly 
with a sledgehammer. You can't stalk him. You have to take a shot and hope you 
get him." 
</P>
<P>
After rushing for 151 yards against Oklahoma, he came back the next week with 
89 yards and two touchdowns against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant impressed Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne, who said the running back "has 
made a big difference in (Iowa State's) team." 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, he has made them a lot more dangerous," Osborne said. "(Former 
Cyclone running back) Joe Henderson was very good, but Bryant gives them 
something extra." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant says it's versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can adapt to any style of running," he said. "I can be a finesse 
runner or I can run hard. I can break into the open, but when I'm in the 
trenches, I like to put my shoulder down and hit people. It all depends on what 
I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Football wasn't all that important to Blaise Bryant. While growing up in Culver 
City and later in Redondo Beach, a day in the surf was more fun than junior 
league football. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little, I always knew I could play," he said. "I just couldn't get 
into it. I messed around." 
</P>
<P>
But when he moved to Cypress in 1980, all that changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived too far from the beach and we lived across the street from the 
football field," Bryant said. "My friends and I would be over there, chasing 
the cheerleaders around. One day, this guy walks up and says, 'Hey, you want to 
play?' "Even then I didn't like playing football. I just outran everyone to the 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until his sophomore year at Cypress that football started being fun. 
His coach on the junior varsity, Rob Walker, became one of his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
But the fun was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant nearly quit the football team after his junior season, his first with 
the varsity. The Centurions suffered one of their worst seasons with a 3-7 
overall record and a last-place finish in the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, a second-stringer, wasn't getting much playing time. He wasn't getting 
along with varsity Coach Kris Van Hook, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Hook wanted me to cut my hair and shave my mustache," Bryant said. 
"Football wasn't fun anymore and I was ready to hang it up. I sat the bench for 
three or four games. It was a weird season." 
</P>
<P>
Van Hook said he had to discipline Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
"When Blaise was a freshman, he was really squirrelly," Van Hook said. "He 
didn't have a clue on life. He did a good job as sophomore, but I sat him out 
the first game and a half of his junior year. He had a tendency to miss 
practice, so I sat him down. I never had a problem with him after that." 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Bryant thought about what he wanted. Finally, Walker 
convinced him to come back for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker came up to me and said I had a shot at a free ride to school," Bryant 
said. " I came out that year and pushed it hard." 
</P>
<P>
John Selbe replaced Van Hook as coach, and Bryant took off. He rushed for 1,305 
yards in 201 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. He was named to every all-star 
team. Recruiters began to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant chose Hawaii. He signed a letter of intent with the Rainbows but failed 
to meet academic requirements under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone to Hawaii if I wanted to," Bryant said. "I had a 3.1 
grade-point average, but my SAT score was a little low." 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at Golden West, a few miles from his parents' house in Huntington 
Beach. As a freshman, he rushed for 801 yards in 138 carries and scored six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His sophomore year, he more than doubled those statistics, leading the nation 
in rushing yards with 1,691. His best game was a 330-yard performance against 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the recruiters began to notice. Bryant improved his grades and was 
eligible for Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of recruiters were trying to force me to sign," Bryant said. "They would 
show up at school and stop me in the halls. I was constantly talking to guys I 
didn't want to. It was getting out of control." 
</P>
<P>
One recruiter who didn't pressure Bryant was Robin Ross, an Iowa State 
assistant coach and a longtime friend of Shackleford. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept putting Coach Ross off, but he understood," Bryant said. "And the Big 
Eight was a running league and I wanted to see if I could run against the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Blaise Bryant is surrounded by reporters. The Big Eight Skywriters' tour is in 
town and every reporter from Cedar Rapids to Boulder wants to know what the 
surf kid thinks of the landlocked Midwest? 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of Interstate (highway) to look at, bugs and humidity," Bryant says 
bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
How about that crazy Ames night life? 
</P>
<P>
"After a game I might hit up a party but that's it," he said. "There are a 
couple of clubs down in Des Moines, but they're nothing like California. It's 
mind-boggling because there's so much to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's wit draws laughs from the media. But there's still a warm spot for 
Ames in Bryant's heart. He says he'll be back here after the season, working on 
his degree in telecommunications -- with or without an NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hardest times of my life was when I first came here," he said. "It 
was hard not to pack it in and just go home. I missed everyone back home and I 
missed my girlfriend. I had never been away from home or the beach." 
</P>

TWO FRIENDS, 10 EVENTS; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNSON OUTLASTED YANG 30 YEARS AGO IN OLYMPIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accompanied by thunder and lightning, two athletes completed a two-day struggle 
for a gold medal that is as well remembered for the athletes' unique 
relationship as it is for their magnificent struggle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the decathlon at the Rome Olympics, Sept. 5-6, 1960. Thirty years ago 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Two athletes, two countries . . . but the same university, the same coach. 
</P>
<P>
Rafer Johnson, a UCLA graduate, was the heavy favorite. He was 25 and just off 
a world record-breaking performance at the U.S. Olympic trials at Eugene, Ore., 
where he'd broken the world record before the end of the ninth event. 
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuan-Kwang, called C.K. by most people, was a 27-year-old UCLA freshman 
from Taiwan who had trained for two years almost daily with Johnson and under 
UCLA track coach Elvin "Ducky" Drake. 
</P>
<P>
When it all came down to two stormy, summer days in Rome, Johnson was the 
winner because he wouldn't fold in the stretch of the final event, the 1,500 
meters. Yang lost, he says today, because he wound up in the wrong 1,500 meter 
heat -- with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The day Johnson won his final decathlon -- he never competed again -- was 
arguably one of track and field's most memorable days. On the same day Johnson 
and Yang were waging the final hours of their decathlon, Herb Elliott of 
Australia ran away from a great 1,500-meter field and set a world record, 
3:35.6, that would last for seven years. And Otis Davis of Los Angeles, in a 
photo finish, won the 400-meter final in 44.9, another world record. 
</P>
<P>
But seldom had two athletes, tethered so tightly to each other's aspirations as 
these two, competed so fiercely on such a stage. Some historians went back to 
the 1924 Paris Olympics for a comparison, when boxers Joe Salas and Jackie 
Fields, representing not only the United States but the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club as well, wound up in the gold medal bout at featherweight. 
</P>
<P>
Rafer Johnson came to UCLA from Kingsburg, Calif., a San Joaquin Valley town 
where his father, Lewis Johnson, found work as a railroad section hand, at a 
peach cannery and in an animal food processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 14, Johnson watched another San Joaquin Valley Olympic decathlon 
champion, Bob Mathias, win a decathlon at nearby Tulare. Studying the 
competition, Johnson figured he could beat half the athletes in the field and 
he hadn't even gone out for track at Kingsburg High yet. 
</P>
<P>
He won a decathlon as a high school senior while being recruited by virtually 
every football coach on the West Coast. None of them won. Ducky Drake, the UCLA 
track coach, did. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a great rapport with Coach Drake, and wanted to compete for him," 
Johnson says today. "I wanted to play football, too, and Red Sanders and I 
talked a lot about it. But I just couldn't fit it in. In 1955 it was the Pan 
American Games, in 1956 it was the Melbourne Olympics . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Yang was a teen phenom in Taiwan. A member of the Takasago ethnic group, which 
inhabited the island of Taiwan for centuries before the Chinese arrived, Yang 
caught the eye of several officials of the Taiwan national track and field 
federation, who raised funds and sent him to the U.S. to train. 
</P>
<P>
He spent more than a year in UCLA extension classes, mastering English, before 
enrolling as a freshman in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Drake had the world's two best decathlon performers on his track, 
every day. Drake, who died at 85 in 1988, was a UCLA institution. When he 
enrolled at UCLA as a freshman in the 1920s, the campus was on Vermont Ave., 
six years before the move to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
When he coached, he coached them together. When they competed, he coached them 
separately, from the first row of the stands. Sportswriters covering the 1960 
Games were fascinated at watching first Johnson visiting privately with Drake, 
exchanging whispers, Yang waiting patiently a few yards away, for his turn. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the 1,500 at Rome," Johnson said recently, "Ducky told me: 'You've got 
to run the race of your life, Rafe, because C.K. is going to run the race of 
his life.' He handled that situation wonderfully. To this day, neither C.K. nor 
I know which one of us he favored, if he did. That's why we've stayed so close 
all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson came to Rome in 1960 as the decathlon's premier performer. Track and 
Field News called his 8,683-point performance in the trials "staggering." With 
a 233-foot, 3-inch javelin throw, his first throw in the ninth event, he broke 
the world record of the Soviet Union's Vasily Kuznetzov (who would finish third 
in Rome). His final total surpassed Kuznetzov's by 326 points. 
</P>
<P>
Few noticed, however, that Yang, too, broke the old world record, by 69 points. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Johnson, 55, is the volunteer president of California Special Olympics, 
funded by the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., Foundation. He has two salaried jobs, as 
spokesman for the Hershey Track and Field Program and for Reebok USA. 
</P>
<P>
He competed at 210 to 215 pounds but today, playing lots of racquetball and 
tennis, he's a lean 190. He lives in Sherman Oaks with his wife, Elizabeth, and 
children Jennifer, 17, and Joshua, 15. He was selected to light the Olympic 
flame at the Coliseum to open the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Yang, 57, lives in both Kao Hsiung, Taiwan, where he is executive director and 
head coach of the country's track and field training center, and Thousand Oaks. 
His wife, Daisy, whom he met at UCLA, lives at the family home in Thousand 
Oaks. The Yangs have two sons, C.K., Jr., 26, and Cedric, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Yang lives in Thousand Oaks for months at a time, following major Asian and 
other international competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson never competed in sports again. Although he'd never played college 
football, the Rams chose him in the NFL draft, as a defensive back. The Rams 
offered him a $10,000 contract, big money then, and he declined. 
</P>

Yang not only continued as a decathlete, he put the world record nearly out of 
sight in 1963, with a 9,131-point performance. Yang's mastery of the fiberglass 
vaulting pole (he briefly held the world vault record at 16-3 1/2) was one 
reason the decathlon scoring tables were revised. 
</P>
<P>
Rome would prove his best chance at an Olympic gold medal. He was eighth at the 
1956 Olympics, second in Rome and fifth in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Both recently discussed their 1960 Rome memories, Johnson in an interview at 
his Santa Monica Special Olympics office, Yang by phone from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
RAFER JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's been 30 years. I told my wife the other day the 30-year 
mark was coming up soon, and she couldn't believe it either. I think about Rome 
so much, I forget how long ago it really was. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal in those days, competing against C.K., was to try to keep him from 
annihilating me in his two best events, the vault and the 1,500, and then I 
would try to annihilate him in my two best events and his two worst events, the 
shot and discus. 
</P>
<P>
"If all other things were roughly equal, I'd win. But they seldom are in the 
decathlon, so we were always pretty close to each other. In Rome, when the 
second day started, the first event was the 110-meter hurdles and I ran an 
awful race. I hit the second hurdle very hard and didn't recover. It was the 
worst hurdles race of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"I always figured if I had a good hurdle race, I would win any decathlon. Now, 
I had a 55-point lead over C.K. after the first day, but blew it all with that 
horrible hurdles (Johnson ran 15.3, Yang 14.6. Johnson's lifetime best was 
13.8) I needed something extra. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, at no time was I confident of winning in Rome. In 1956, I was the 
world record holder in Melbourne, and Milt Campbell came along, had two 
fantastic days, and beat me. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first day, C.K. had had a bad shotput, which he almost always did. The 
worst rainfall was on the first day, and he fouled a couple of times and had 
trouble gripping the wet shot. So I buried him pretty good (51-10 3/4 to 43-8 
3/8) there, but that was before my hurdles race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought of that hurdles race, the first event on the second day, many 
times. I didn't warm up properly. With the storms the day before, there were 
long delays. I didn't get back to the village until something like 2 a.m. I was 
wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
"So when we lined up for the hurdles, I'm thinking in the back of my mind: 
'Conserve energy.' It was the worst thing I could do, the worst kind of 
attitude. Afterward, I went over and talked to Ducky and he told me: 'Keep your 
head up. This is like life, one event at a time. Forget about it and get on 
with it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I buried C.K. in the next event, the discus (159-1 to 130-8 1/2) and got some 
of it back, but I was still depressed over the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"C.K.'s best event, the vault, was coming up and I knew if I had another poor 
effort there -- it was a weak event for me -- I might not catch him in the 
1,500. The javelin followed the vault, but we were fairly close there. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I got my career best in the vault, 13-5 3/8 (Yang did 14-1 1/4), and for 
the first time I felt OK. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1,500, we both wound up in the same heat, which was very good for me. I 
needed to stay within 10 seconds of C.K. to win it, and I planned to stick to 
him like a buddy in combat. I had one other advantage, and I don't think C.K. 
knew this at the time -- this was my last decathlon. I was prepared to run as 
fast as I had to in this last race of my life." 
</P>
<P>
And he did. In the cool night air, before 50,000 in the Olympic Stadium, 
Johnson stayed two strides behind Yang, who tried but failed to pull away with 
two separate sprints over the final 300 meters. 
</P>
<P>
At the finish, they collapsed into each other's arms. 
</P>
<P>
Talking of the 1,500, Yang said: "I knew he would never let go of me unless he 
collapsed. I knew he would win. He is that way." 
</P>
<P>
C.K. YANG 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years? It seems like only yesterday! I have films of some of the 
competition on video and I still watch them. It doesn't seem so long ago when I 
look at the films. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two turning points for me, the shotput and the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain was really bad, especially the first day. It rained hard for three 
hours, and when they started to dry the place up, the starting blocks for the 
400 were under water. The shot was a terrible event for me and having to put a 
wet one made it even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"My first put was a foul, then it started raining hard again. The shot was so 
slippery I had to concentrate on just getting off a fair put, let alone a good 
one. I was afraid I'd foul on every put if I wasn't careful. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I took some Taiwan athletes to Rome for an international meet in 
1987 and it rained hard then, too. It made me think of that day, of the trouble 
I had with the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had an outside chance to win after nine events . . . until I found 
out Rafe and I were in the same 1,500 heat. I knew he'd stay right with me, no 
matter how fast I ran. If we'd been in separate heats, I'd have won the gold 
medal, not Rafer. 
</P>
<P>
"Rafe and I loved competing against each other. We needed each other, in a way. 
In one of the practices before the Games in Rome, Rafe's pole broke during a 
vault and he somersaulted in the air and landed awkwardly, on his back. 
</P>
<P>
"He was OK, but the first thing I thought was: 'Oh, no -- I don't want to win 
this without Rafe in the competition!' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a remarkable time for all three of us. Same school, same coach, 
different nations. It was a unique relationship, like a father and two sons. 
And not once did Ducky ever show favoritism to either of us."

JIM MURRAY: HE COMPETES TWO DAYS FOR ONE GOLDEN MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some guys work hardly at all for their Olympic gold medals. I mean, Ben Johnson 
got one (for about a day) for less than 10 seconds of running. Even the 
hurdlers' agonies are over in 13 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The team sports take a bit more doing -- but how strenuous can it be beating 
Uruguay in an early round in basketball? How hard is it to stand in right field 
for nine innings in baseball? 
</P>
<P>
But, it always seemed to me, decathletes come from a different segment of the 
population, that class of people who like to do things the hard way. I mean, 
they're probably the kind of guys who would get into bomb squads or put out oil 
well fires, who would dig tunnels under rivers, clean up after the elephants in 
the circus, walk high iron. They'd be the kind of people who would offer to 
sleep on the floor if the room was crowded. They'd probably marry the kind of 
women who would yell at them a lot. They wouldn't mind if the elevator was out. 
They'd climb the stairs anyway. 
</P>
<P>
They must enjoy pain. 
</P>
<P>
Listen! A guy who puts the shot in track and field thinks he has it tough. So 
does the guy who pole vaults, or throws the discus or javelin, runs the mile, 
the 100, the 400. It takes a lot of dedication to get to be world class at any 
of these, to say nothing of the high jump and the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
What about a guy who has to do all of the above? 
</P>
<P>
The decathlon is not an event, it's an inquisition, the athletic equivalent of 
getting your fingernails pulled out. It was probably invented by Torquemada. Or 
Himmler. The Marquis De Sade would have loved it. 
</P>
<P>
It is a two-day, 10-event torture chamber designed to make the competitor feel 
as if he is crawling out of a train wreck or has been without food and water 
and confined to solitary on Devil's Island. You come out of it in about the 
condition of a survivor of the Battle of Jutland. Your ears are ringing, your 
calves ache, you are so dehydrated you can't go to the bathroom for days. If a 
doctor stumbled upon you, he'd order you wrapped in blankets and put in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson loves it. He puts up with the sore back, the swollen wrists, the 
burning in the lungs. He wants to get his gold medal the old-fashioned way -- 
earn it. 
</P>
<P>
Decathletes take great pride in the fact they not only can play any sport but 
excel in it. They make a big deal of a Bo Jackson as a two-sport man. What if 
he were a 10-sport man? That's what decathletes are. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinters who take the gold in the dashes get the accolade "the world's fastest 
human." The weightlifter becomes "the world's strongest man." The decathlete 
becomes "the world's greatest athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson is our best decathloner in a long time, our high hope for the 
Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The decathlon has a proud tradition in the U.S. Jim Thorpe was a decathlete 
(and a pentathlete) in 1912. He inspired the King of Sweden, no less, to blurt, 
"Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete!" bestowing the label which clung to 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be an American event. Bob Mathias won it as a 17-year-old schoolboy 
in the London Olympics in '48 and repeated four years later. Rafer Johnson won 
at Rome. Milt Campbell won at Melbourne, Bill Toomey at Mexico City, and Bruce 
Jenner founded a theatrical career when he won at Montreal in 1976. Decathletes 
have gone on to become movie stars (Bruce Bennett, Jenner) and football stars 
(Campbell, Mathias, Thorpe). 
</P>
<P>
Decathletes are gamesmen who, if they stuck with one sport, probably would 
become world class in it. Campbell was an Olympic-speed hurdler, Rafer made the 
team as a long-jumper. But, decathletes are the Don Juans of sport. They're 
fickle. Polygamists. They can't stick with one. They find the others too 
fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson didn't set out to be a decathlon man. He went out for football in 
high school in Montana just to be popular on campus and, when a coach, after 
watching him pick up a javelin and toss it like a matchstick, suggested "Why 
don't you take up the decathlon?" Johnson said "What's a decathlon?" 
</P>
<P>
He found out. It was the track and field equivalent of getting tarred and 
feathered. It's a sport for which the word "grueling" is inadequate. "A tennis 
match is grueling," Johnson says. "A decathlon is inhuman." 
</P>
<P>
Americans won nine of the first 14 Olympic decathlons, but we haven't won it 
since Jenner in '76. 
</P>
<P>
An ideal decathlon would be one in which the competitor broke the world record 
in each of the 10 events. Decathlon points are awarded on the basis of how 
close you come to an existing world mark. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, who lives in the L.A. suburb of Montclair, has flirted with the 
world mark (Daley Thompson's 8,647 points set at the L.A. Olympics in '84). He 
was well in the 8,500 range when the international federation changed the 
weight and configuration of the javelin. It was being thrown so far it was 
becoming a hazard for spectators, landing in the first rows of the seats. Dave 
thinks he could have come closer to the world mark with the old javelin. 
"They've taken 20 to 30 feet off the throw. It's as if they added a foot to the 
hurdles." 
</P>
<P>
He was picking up as many as 980 points with the old javelin. He just hopes 
they make the equitable adjustment on the international decathlon table so 
that, after Barcelona, when you refer to a Johnson as one of the world's 
greatest decathletes, you won't mean only Rafer.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next time the Dodgers take an 11-1 or 7-0 lead on a Tuesday night at Dodger 
Stadium, the crowd should start chanting, "Dee-fense, dee-fense." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lousy fielding, combined with poor pitching, meant come-from-way-ahead defeats 
for the Dodgers against Philadelphia and Houston and most likely cost them 
whatever chance they had to win the National League West championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of course, to err is nothing new for the Dodgers. It's difficult to understand 
why a team that relies so much on pitching wouldn't put together a tight 
defense. The last time the Dodgers led the league in fielding was 1960. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This time, I stayed for the entire nine innings. Good way to avoid traffic 
leaving the stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Young Ramon Martinez, who no longer is striking out people, may be tired. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is hoping to attract 60,000 for its opening game against Oklahoma Saturday 
at the Rose Bowl. The Dodgers should do 45,000 to 48,000 each day against the 
Reds over the weekend at Dodger Stadium. But the question mark is how many will 
show up for the Raider-Denver game at the Coliseum Sunday. Advance sales have 
been encouraging, and with a good walk-up, the count could hit 60,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Terry Donahue is 9-5 in openers since he became UCLA coach in 1976. Among the 
losses was a 38-3 whipping by Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., in 1986. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Can the Bruins, who weren't real fast last season, keep up with the speedy 
Sooners?. . . . Tennessee, which tied Colorado before routing mighty University 
of the Pacific, received a first-place vote in the Associated Press poll. 
Wonder if the same person will vote for the Volunteers again now that they've 
lost Chuck Webb for the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Young USC can use the extra week to prepare for Penn State, but the Trojans 
came out of the 34-16 opening-night victory over Syracuse without a significant 
injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two Raiders, Ron Brown and Sam Graddy, were members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic 
400-meter relay team, whose record was just broken by a French team. . . .

Lawrence Taylor got what he deserved from the Giants -- enough money to make 
him the highest paid defensive player in football. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Stanford and Denver Bronco Coach John Ralston will coordinate the World 
League of American Football's "Operation Discovery," a search for talent in 
Europe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Carl Lewis-Ben Johnson race probably won't come off this fall is 
that Lewis' people are asking for three times as much money as Johnson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Wysocki, who upset Mary Decker in the 1,500-meter run at the 1984 Olympic 
trials, recently gave birth to a son, Tom. Asked at the time if she was 
surprised by her victory over rival Decker at the Coliseum, Ruth said, "Hell 
no. I've beaten her under three names -- Ruth Kleinsasser, Ruth Caldwell and 
now Ruth Wysocki." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Mike Tyson will start wearing modern-day headgear, instead of the World 
War I aviator models worn by some of his idols, after suffering that cut in a 
sparring session with Greg Page. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Futch, 79, is applying the Futch Touch to Riddick Bowe, who will try for 
his 11th consecutive victory Friday night against washed-up Pinklon Thomas in 
Washington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's a sign of the times when Jack Clark calls the San Diego Padres' offer of a 
one-year, $2.5-million contract, "Disgraceful." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The trade after the 1988 season between Texas and the Chicago Cubs that 
included Mitch (Wild Man) Williams and Rafael Palmeiro is looking better for 
the Rangers now that Palmeiro is contending for the American League batting 
championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Atlanta Brave announcer Skip Caray doesn't have a team to match his 
talent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dave Stewart-Roger Clemens matchup Tuesday night was one of the hottest 
tickets ever at Boston's Fenway Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: San Francisco 49ers are fined $500,000 for violating NFL's corporate 
ownership policy. Reaction: That's pocket money -- or some Class B free agent's 
salary -- to Eddie DeBartolo Jr. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Drink and driving don't mix, but a lot of televised sporting events are 
sponsored by beer and automobile companies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A very thin volume would be, "Strategy in Quarter Horse Racing." . . .

<P>
Jerry West wants to acquire a guard to replace Michael Cooper before Laker camp 
opens next month in Hawaii. However, it may not be a big name. Donnie Walsh, 
the Indiana Pacers' player personnel director, says Reggie Miller is not 
available. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario wore virtually the same outfits 
Wednesday at the U.S. Open. I don't think Andre Agassi will have that problem 
today.

GIANTS REPORTEDLY MAKE TAYLOR HIGHEST PAID DEFENSIVE PLAYER

Lawrence Taylor reportedly became the highest paid defensive player in the NFL 
when the linebacker ended a 45-day holdout and signed a new three-year contract 
with the New York Giants Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Taylor's agent, Joe Courrege, 
said he was the highest paid defensive player in the NFL, meaning $1.6 million 
was the probable figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gets exactly what they wanted," Taylor said at a news conference that 
was supposed to be for Coach Bill Parcells to discuss this week's season opener 
against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 31, was in the final year of his contract, which would have paid him 
$1.21 million, but he wanted to renegotiate and asked for $2 million per year. 
The Giants reportedly had offered $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although contract terms were not disclosed, Taylor would have to make more than 
$1.6 million this season to do better than Minnesota defensive end Chris 
Doleman, reportedly set to sign for $1.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Taylor deal, the Eagles' Reggie White was the highest paid defensive 
player at $1.51 million, with Buffalo's Bruce Smith next at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd look kind of stupid (complaining about) the money I will be making because 
it is good money," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The linebacker says he will be ready for Sunday's opener against the 
Philadelphia Eagles but added, "I would have liked a little contact before the 
first game." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have asked the league for a two-week roster exemption for Taylor so 
he will not count on the 47-man roster. The exemption would run out early if 
Taylor plays.

SPONSOR SCRAMBLES TO STOP FAN BOYCOTT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SAN DIEGO RESTAURATEUR FLOWN TO NEW YORK TO MEET WITH NBC AND 
CBS, WHO SUSPEND PLANS TO SCRAMBLE GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Lebovitz, a San Diego restaurateur who describes himself as "just the 
average fan," was flown to New York Wednesday by one of the NFL's biggest 
advertisers to meet with network executives about the scrambling of televised 
games. 
</P>
<P>
CBS and NBC later issued statements confirming that plans to scramble NFL 
broadcasts have been suspended, at least for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling has become a dirty word to Lebovitz and thousands of other owners of 
home and commercial satellite systems, who were stunned by the NFL's 
announcement on Aug. 17 that, beginning with the start of the season Sunday, 
the bulk of its games would be available only to network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
The news was especially upsetting to thousands of owners of restaurants and 
sports bars, whose businesses were being helped greatly by being able to show a 
full menu of NFL games every Sunday, as opposed to the one or two shown 
locally. And fans in rural markets, who lack access to cable and free TV, 
complained that they would be "frozen out" of the NFL's plans -- to use the 
words of an irate congressman -- if scrambling was not reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of scrambling is the blocking by the originating network of the 
normal televised feed. That is done via an electronic distortion of the picture 
that makes it unwatchable. Prior to the recent plans by the networks, 
individuals and business establishments with satellite dishes and specially 
purchased decoding devises could unscramble the picture for their viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing outcry led to a series of confusing announcements by the league and 
the networks, which now say plans to scramble are indefinitely on hold. 
</P>
<P>
It also led to the emergence of Lebovitz's grass-roots consumer effort, the 
Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights, which last week launched a nationwide boycott of 
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., one of the NFL's main sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
And it reached a peak Tuesday night, when Lebovitz, whose chain of Sluggo's 
specializes in hot dogs and hamburgers, was invited by the Miller Brewing Co. 
-- his latest boycott target -- to be flown to New York to meet with network 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The transplanted Chicagoan, who says, "They can do anything, but they can't 
take away my Bears," said he met with NBC officials for an hour and with a CBS 
official for 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he said he was satisfied with the statement by NBC, which said it 
lacked the technology to scramble in 1990, but angry with CBS, from which he 
failed to get assurances "in plain English" that the network wouldn't scramble 
before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lebovitz said the boycott of Anheuser-Busch and Miller would 
continue, with Sears Roebuck and Co. being added next week "unless there's a 
stronger announcement." 
</P>
<P>
"NBC assured us it would not scramble this year," Lebovitz said by phone from 
New York. "But right now, I'm very frustrated with CBS. The meeting with NBC 
went very well. They were articulate, well-groomed, nice people. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're extremely disappointed in CBS. The young man we met with at CBS told 
us there would be no scrambling by CBS, but only because it 'wishes to remain 
competitive' with NBC. The bottom line is, they're not going to scramble, but 
they refused to say it in English, so we walked out of the meeting. We're not 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the networks agreed to such a meeting, Lebovitz said: "I guess they 
wanted to size me up and decide what kind of a monster I am." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Markey, a spokesman for NBC, confirmed his network's meeting with Lebovitz 
and the outcome of the session -- that scrambling won't take place on NBC, at 
least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS, confirmed her network's meeting with 
Lebovitz, characterizing the motive as "an attempt to explain our position. We 
gave him a copy of our statement . . . and that's about that." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Fogelson, a spokesman for the Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co., said his 
company arranged the meeting between Lebovitz and the networks to try and 
"facilitate" a resolution to the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"In discussions with Norman, he indicated that he had wanted the help of the 
Miller Brewing Co. to get the networks to listen to the concerns of his 
association," Fogelson said. "And we agreed to arrange meetings for him with 
CBS and NBC. We did not sit in on those meetings, nor did we indicate to Norman 
what he was likely to hear from the networks." 
</P>
<P>
Fogelson said late Wednesday that he was "surprised" to hear that Lebovitz had 
continued the boycott, which executives at both Miller and Anheuser-Busch 
admitted has had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
"His stated objective was that if the networks met his objective of not 
scrambling this year, he would end his boycott," Fogelson said. "And they have 
done that. He wasn't talking 1991 and beyond; he was talking this season." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it were a little out of the ordinary for a fan and advocate to be 
flown to Manhattan to meet with network brass in the carpeted suites of CBS and 
NBC, Fogelson sighed and said: "The fact that the networks agreed to meet with 
him indicated that they were concerned that we were concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz, 52, who moved to San Diego 5 1/2 years ago, said he retains season 
tickets to the Chicago Bears' games. He said he attended every Bear home game 
until he learned 3 1/2 years ago that satellite technology could bring all Bear 
games into his living room in La Jolla -- or into his restaurants in LaJolla 
and Hillcrest, which often draw large crowds for satellite showings of Cubs' 
and Bears' games. He said that, "above all," he's motivated by the desire to 
keep seeing those games, short of moving back to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"If I end up having to do that, I will," he said. "I will see my Bears." 
</P>
<P>
After the meetings, Lebovitz said he was convinced that both networks will be 
"fully scrambled" by the start of the 1991 season, and that only Congress can 
prevent it. And he said he was told by executives at both networks that after 
the NFL's new $3.6-billion TV agreement expires in 1994, the league will 
televise all games on a "pay-per-view" basis, at roughly $10 a game per 
household. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling the power the NFL has over those networks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the networks and the NFL declined comment on Lebovitz's remarks 
about pay-per-view.

REDS 'STICK IT TO REST OF THE NL WEST WITH A 5-3 VICTORY OVER THE GIANTS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PINIELLA IS EJECTED AGAIN, BUT CINCINNATI ENDS ITS CANDLESTICK PARK 
LOSING STREAK AT 11 GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having blown 5-1 and 4-1 leads while losing twice to the Atlanta Braves, the 
Cincinnati Reds flew to the West Coast Tuesday night unaware that the Dodgers 
had wasted a 7-0 lead in a 10-8 loss to the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Red Manager Lou Piniella said he found the news as much of an eye-opener as his 
room-service coffee Wednesday morning, but beyond that he didn't have a 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to go in and beat them ourselves," Piniella said of the Dodgers and 
a three-game series that begins in Los Angeles Friday night. "I mean, what 
difference does it make what they do against somebody else?" 
</P>
<P>
Plenty, of course. 
</P>
<P>
That was clear again Wednesday night, when his Reds ended their 11-game losing 
streak at Candlestick Park and defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-3, to move 
7 1/2 games ahead of the Dodgers and 9 1/2 ahead of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Even the fact that Piniella lost his pregame composure and was ejected for the 
fifth time didn't hurt the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss was painful for the Giants, who had been hopeful after picking up 
two games in the standings while the Reds were losing those two in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"They've given us every chance in the world," Giant left fielder Kevin Mitchell 
said of the Reds. "Sometimes it's hard to tell if guys are pressing or just 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Will Clark: "We beat 'em two games and we're almost back in it. 
It's all or nothing now. Sweep and we see a ray of light." 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Piniella sprawled on the floor of his clubhouse office, 
watching the New York Mets play the Pittsburgh Pirates on television. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody points to the frustration level of the team that's leading, but it's 
just as frustrating for the teams behind us not to make up significant ground 
when we struggle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the teams that have squandered opportunities. I mean, every time we 
struggle people expect us to collapse because we've never won, but we've 
bounced back, held our position and learned a lot from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about our situation. It's in our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Their victory wasn't stylish, but the Reds did take things into their hands 
with 14 hits, including eight doubles, tying the league's season high. First 
baseman Hal Morris raised his 81-game average to .350 with two doubles and a 
solo homer. Norm Charlton, expelled as a bullpen Nasty Boy when he moved into 
the rotation, scattered six hits over seven innings to improve his earned-run 
average to 1.54 for 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella was ejected by plate umpire Jim Quick in the fifth inning, his third 
ejection by the crew that was present Aug. 21 in Cincinnati when a furious 
Piniella, twice hurled the first base bag, prompting a radio station to sponsor 
a base-throwing contest at Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati. Piniella was 
ejected that time, too. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he was ejected while in the dugout for sniping about a strike call 
on Barry Larkin in the fifth inning, the umpire later saying Piniella attempted 
to intimidate him. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Quick thumb in more ways than one, and Piniella raced out, engaging 
the plate umpire in a finger-pointing debate and having words with umpires 
Terry Tata at third and Dutch Rennert at first. Because he was concerned about 
fan abuse and threats the last time the Reds were here, Piniella eventually 
asked a security officer to accompany him to the clubhouse door in the 
right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
This all followed a pregame attempt at detente by Piniella and Giant Manager 
Roger Craig, who participated in a war of words the last time their teams met. 
Piniella and Craig talked by clubhouse phone Wednesday night and agreed that it 
was an out-of-character and out-of-proportion chain of events that will not 
affect their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to win the division by 10 games," Red first baseman Todd Benzinger 
said after the game, "but if we maintain what we have we'll be fine. We just 
can't give other teams the feeling that they're creeping up on us. If we can 
keep it at 5 1/2 or 6 1/2, maybe they'll start to see it's a hopeless cause."

PRESS TRIES TO MAKE IT RECORD FOUR IN A ROW AT HIS SAUGUS 'HOME'

<P>
Dan Press proved last year that he can run for a championship when he won eight 
main events in his Chevrolet Camaro to take the NASCAR Southwest Tour series 
for late-model stock cars. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Press decided it was too expensive to defend his championship in 
the 18-race schedule, so he is entering only selected races. The first ones on 
his list were at Saugus Speedway, where he won last May and where he will be 
favored Saturday night when the Southwest Tour returns to the one-third-mile 
paved oval for the Miller Genuine Draft 100. 
</P>
<P>
Press has won the past three tour events at Saugus, and if he can win Saturday 
night, it will set a series record for consecutive victories on the same track. 
Press won two last year and the opener this year. Mike Chase won three in a row 
at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield before Loran Kelley snapped his string on 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
That race was also the last outing for Press, who finished second. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of rusty heading for Saugus, but like I've always said, we figure 
that's our home track," Press said. "Saugus is a tough track to tame, and all 
those years we've run there have really helped. Running there is like putting 
on a good pair of shoes that fit you nicely. If everything hangs together, 
we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his three Southwest Tour victories at Saugus, Press won track 
championships there in 1978 and '82. He also set the track's one-lap qualifying 
record of 77.017 m.p.h. last year. 
</P>
<P>
Press won two of the season's first three races in defense of his Southwest 
Tour title, but it wasn't enough to convince him to run the full series. 
Saturday night will be his sixth race of 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the championship) got too expensive to run, what with all the money we 
spent and the money we lost by taking time away from the business to run 20 
events," he said. "They cut a couple of races off the schedule this year, but 
we still couldn't see how we could afford to do the whole thing again. Business 
is more important than fun." 
</P>
<P>
Press runs a machine shop, DPI (for Dan Press Industry), in Lebec, near his 
Frazier Park home on the Ridge Route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. DPI 
fabricates aerospace and race car parts. 
</P>
<P>
Two crashes at Mesa Marin, one in a race on April 7 and the other while 
practicing for a May 19 race, also contributed to expenses and lost time. 
</P>
<P>
"Both times it was a tire that came off the rim," Press said. "The second time 
it happened, it really tore up the car and just about totaled it. It still 
wasn't right when we came back for the June 30 race. We set a fast time, but 
(the car) didn't run as good in the race." 
</P>
<P>
The Chevy is the same one he drove last year, although the sheetmetal has been 
changed to make it a Lumina instead of a Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
Press will find a hot standings battle in progress Saturday night, with Doug 
George of Atwater, Calif.; M. K. Kanke of Granada Hills, and Ron Hornaday Jr. 
of Palmdale only 70 points apart after 13 races. George has won three races, 
more than any other driver. 
</P>
<P>
An added entry will be Stanley Smith of Chelsea, Ala., defending champion in 
NASCAR's All-American Challenge Series. 
</P>
<P>
The final race for the track street stock championship will also be held 
Saturday night; Craig Rayburn has a 14-point lead over Dave Blankenship, with 
Ed Horst two points further back. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY BIKES -- The third and final qualifying round for the U.S. Nationals 
will be held Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. With 
14 of 16 positions at stake, it is the closest final qualifier in the history 
of American speedway racing. After earlier rounds in Sacramento and 
Victorville, defending champion Bobby Schwartz leads with 39 points, followed 
by Phil Collins with 38 and Steve Lucero and Mike Faria with 30 each. Shawn 
Moran and Billy Hamill are seeded into the finals by virtue of their Nissan 
American Final finishes. Moran, however, has indicated that he will not return 
from England to ride, so his spot will be taken by Rick Miller. The U.S. Finals 
are Oct. 6 in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Moran became the third American in six years to tie for first place in the 
World Finals and then lose in a runoff when he was defeated Saturday in England 
by Per Jonsson of Sweden. Lance King lost in 1984 to Erik Gundersen and Hans 
Nielsen of Denmark, and Sam Ermolenko lost to the same pair in 1985. Jonsson is 
the first rider other than a Dane to win the world championship since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman took a major step toward winning his third 
consecutive California Racing Assn. championship with a 50-lap victory Saturday 
night at Ascot Park and a fourth place Sunday in Phoenix. With 12 races 
remaining -- eight at Ascot -- he moved within 34 points of leader Brad 
Noffsinger and 24 of early-season leader John Redican. Shuman, who will be 
going for his sixth season CRA victory Saturday night at Ascot, was 237 points 
behind when the CRA came home from its midwestern tour in May. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The National Hot Rod Assn.'s Pacific Division of the Winston 
Racing Series, featuring more than 400 sportsman drivers, will return this 
weekend to the L.A. County Raceway in Littlerock, near Palmdale. The fourth of 
six division races, in which competitors earn points toward regional 
championships, it carries a purse of $95,200. Qualifying Friday and Saturday 
will set the fields for final eliminations starting at noon Sunday. Favorites 
include Brad Anderson of Covina, three-time NHRA champion in alcohol funny car, 
and Blaine Johnson of Santa Maria, defending champion in top alcohol dragster. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The final race of the Southern California section of the 
Continental Motosport Club's Trans Cal Nationals will be held Sunday at 
Carlsbad Raceway. Winners will meet Northern California riders in the finals 
Sept. 15-16 at Marysville. . . . CMC riders will also compete Friday night at 
Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- Imperial Raceway, near El Centro, will begin its fall season 
Saturday night with the Arizona Midget Racing Assn. furnishing competition. 
Five-time Arizona champion Jack Yeley of Phoenix heads the entries. Also on the 
program at the California Mid-Winter Fairgrounds will be street stocks. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Versatile Mike Kirby won his 12th Figure 8 main event in his past 
16 starts at Ascot Park last week, one night after finishing eighth in a CRA 
sprint car race. Kirby will be racing his Figure 8 machine Sunday night at 
Ascot in the NASCAR Winston Racing Series competition. . . . Only two races 
remain in the Cajon Speedway sportsman stock championship, and Jerry Gay, who 
won his 101st career main event last week, leads Larry Lyon by only six points 
going into Saturday night's race. . . . Dirt track cars will run Saturday night 
at Santa Maria Speedway. . . . Street stocks will race Friday night at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
HYDROPLANES -- Defending champion Tom D'Eath and four-time champion Chip 
Hanauer will take their rivalry for the Unlimited Hydroplane championship down 
to the final race, the Budweiser Cup on Sept. 16 on San Diego's Mission Bay. 
D'Eath, driving Miss Budweiser, and Hanauer, in Miss Circus Circus, have each 
won four races this season, but D'Eath leads in points, 9925 to 9352. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE CARS -- The Firefighters Grand Prix, a charity event for the Alisa Ann 
Ruch California Burn Foundation, will be run this weekend at Willow Springs 
Raceway in conjunction with the Vintage Auto Racing Assn.'s Coors/Essex House 
Vintage Gold Cup series. Kyle Shields of the Orange County Fire Dept. is 
defending champion in the Firefighters race, in which competitors drive Toyota 
Celicas that were used in the Long Beach Grand Prix celebrity race. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD RACING -- The Nevada 500, successor to the old Frontier 500 Las 
Vegas-to-Reno race, will be held Saturday outside of Pahrump, Nev. The High 
Desert Racing Assn. race will start in the ghost town of Johnnie, travel north 
to Beatty and then continue through historic Central Nevada towns of Bonnie 
Clair, Silverpeak, Dyer, Tonopah and Goldfield before heading south to Johnnie 
and on to the finish at the Pahrump Station Inn. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Juan Fangio won the International Motor Sports Assn. Camel GTP 
race in a Dan Gurney-prepared Toyota last Sunday in San Antonio, but the 2-3 
finish by Chip Robinson and Geoff Brabham gave Nissan its second consecutive 
IMSA manufacturers championship. The season ends on Nov. 11 at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
NECROLOGY -- Memorial services for Dave Sanborn, the California Racing Assn. 
course worker who died from injuries received when he was hit by a car Saturday

RAMS' ROBINSON TURNS WORRIES, ATTENTION TO BATTERED OFFENSE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams have been spending most of their time trying to patch together a 
defensive unit, but with the return of three defensive holdouts over the 
weekend and the addition of cornerback Mickey Sutton Tuesday, Coach John 
Robinson can focus his concern on the offense. And concern he has. 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning will likely be a factor for former holdouts Kevin Greene, Doug 
Reed and Michael Stewart. But rushing the passer, plugging up the run holes and 
knowing your spot in a zone defense don't require the precise timing that is 
involved in the Rams' intricate passing game. 
</P>
<P>
So now, Robinson has new problems to worry about going into Sunday's season 
opener against the Packers at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Both starting receivers -- Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson -- have hamstring 
injuries that have severely limited their practice time. Ellard caught one pass 
in exhibition play, Anderson none. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about getting started offensively," Robinson said. "The talent is 
coming back, but we've been off the practice field for some time now, and I 
think the timing could be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams picked up linebacker Greg Clark off waivers from Green Bay Wednesday. 
Clark, from Torrance and Arizona State, who went to the Packers as a Plan B 
player from Miami, will be primarily a special teams player. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
All-Pro wide receiver Henry Ellard agreed to a three-year contract extension 
Wednesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. . . . Cornerback Mickey 
Sutton, picked up on waivers from the Buffalo Bills, will start at left corner 
against Green Bay. JOHN WEYLER

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
FONTANA STARTS THE WAY IT FINISHED, ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a moment of truth for Fontana High's football team. It was the fourth 
quarter of its Southern Section Division I semifinal game last December against 
Huntington Beach Edison and the Steelers trailed, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
After crushing 12 opponents, outscoring them by more than 400 points, Fontana 
found itself struggling to stay alive in the playoffs. Winning a second title 
in three years seemed far away. 
</P>
<P>
But the Steelers rallied to win, 48-35, and defeated San Bernardino San 
Gorgonio, 35-7, in the championship game the next week. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Fontana will again open as the section's top-rated team, and with 
his entire offensive line returning, Coach Dick Bruich has reason to believe 
the Steelers could be even better. 
</P>
<P>
No team has won consecutive Southern Section major division titles since 
Anaheim Servite in 1982-83, but Fontana, which also won the title in 1987 and 
was a runner-up in '84, might have the team to accomplish the feat. A look at 
the Times' preseason top 15 Southern Section football teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. FONTANA 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 14-0 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers return 10 starters from last season's Citrus Belt League 
championship team, including linemen Robert Loya and Clay Hattabaugh. Loya, 6-4 
and 270 pounds, is considered one of the top linemen in the nation and 
Hattabaugh, 6-5 and 262, is also a heavily recruited prospect. Running behind 
the Steelers' experienced line will be Don Small and Hollerith Jones. Mark 
Bennett is a solid returning starter at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Bruich, in his 14th year at Fontana with a career coaching record of 127-31-1, 
will again have a stingy defense to count on with four returning starters, 
including linebacker Bryan Sylvester, an all-Division I selection last year, 
and lineman Jeff Karp, who excelled in the playoffs a year ago. Against seven 
Citrus Belt League opponents last year, the Steelers allowed a combined 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
2. CANYON COUNTRY CANYON 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 8-4-1 
</P>
<P>
With the Golden League moved up from Division II, it is fitting that Canyon 
Country , which has a 39-1 all-time league record and has reached the playoff 
semifinals or final seven consecutive seasons, has one of its best teams. Last 
Thursday, the Cowboys opened the season by defeating Honolulu St. Louis, 40-0, 
to end the Crusaders' 55-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Harry Welch, who has a 90-17-1 record, returns eight starters on defense. 
It is headed by senior linebacker Scott Blade, a starter since his sophomore 
year, lineman Brad Weaver and defensive back Mark Santos. On offense, the 
Cowboys will rely on the running talents of David McDivitt, who rushed for 198 
yards and scored twice against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
3. LA PUENTE BISHOP AMAT 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 7-4 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mark Paredes may not agree with the Lancers' early season rankings, but 
after the coaches in the powerful Angelus League named them the team to beat, 
it is hard for Bishop Amat to go unnoticed. With six starters returning, 
including all-league quarterback Zack Zertuche and running back Jason 
Patterson, the Lancers hope to have a better showing in the playoffs than last 
year, when they lost in the first round to Rialto Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Zertuche passed for more than 1,800 yards and 14 touchdowns last season, but he 
had Jeremy Smith, now at California, and Jason Green, now at UCLA, on the 
receiving end. Look for junior Scott Fields to become one of top offensive 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
4. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Division II 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 12-2 
</P>
<P>
With the South Coast League moving up from Division III, El Toro Coach Bob 
Johnson will get a chance to showcase his second son, Rob Johnson, at 
quarterback. Johnson is the brother of former UCLA quarterback Bret and was an 
all-Southern Section performer last season at wide receiver. He will move back 
to his original position of quarterback and will be looked upon to carry a 
young offense, which returns two starters. 
</P>
<P>
It is on defense, with linemen Jeremy Hogue and Matt Krajec, linebacker Brian 
Haas and defensive back Danny Maetues, where the Chargers have experience. 
</P>
<P>
5. PASADENA MUIR 
</P>
<P>
Division II 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 11-1-2 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Tyree directed Muir to a co-championship last season in his first 
year, playing Santa Barbara to a 7-7 tie. This year, the Mustangs, who finished 
second to Arcadia in the Pacific League last season, are expected to be even 
better with the return of eight starters -- four of them all-league selections. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's secondary may be the best in the Southern Section, with Reggie Reser and 
Demetrice Martin leading the way. The Mustangs probably have the toughest 
nonconference schedule, playing Palmdale, Fontana, Bishop Amat, Anaheim Servite 
and City power Banning. 
</P>
<P>
6. REDLANDS 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 9-3 
</P>
<P>
Expectations are high for Redlands and tailback Marcus Rogers, an all Division 
I defensive back last season. First-year Coach Dave Perkins, who led Corona to 
the Division V title last year, will have seven returning starters, including 
quarterback Julian Burrola and fullback Mike Dragna. Playing in the Citrus Belt 
League with Fontana does not give the Terriers an easy path to the playoffs, 
but their nonconference schedule is not that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
7. HUNTINGTON BEACH EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 10-3 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dave White, who has a 29-16 record in his five seasons, returns six 
starters and 20 lettermen from a year ago. Last season, Edison won the Sunset 
League and came within minutes of upsetting Fontana on the road in the playoff 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Chargers will not have the one-two offensive punch in 
quarterback Donnie Smith and running back Shane Sherman. However, they do have 
all-league wide receiver Mike Cunningham on offense and safety Mike Hawks and 
end Chip Anderson on defense. 
</P>
<P>
8. LOS ANGELES LOYOLA 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 10-2 
</P>
<P>
Loyola no longer will have the defunct Del Rey League to beat up on, but the 
Cubs are talented enough to hold their own in the Angelus League. Coach Steve 
Grady will have Corby Smith, son of USC Coach Larry Smith, at quarterback and 
Alex Yeboah handling most of the rushing chores, with David Susank leading the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
9. HAWTHORNE 
</P>
<P>
Division III 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 9-2 
</P>
<P>
With 14 starters and 44 lettermen returning, Hawthorne, which drops from 
Division II in the Bay League, is the team to beat in Division III. Coach Goy 
Casillas has one of the fastest teams in the Southern Section, with trackman 
Erik Allen leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
10. LONG BEACH POLY 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 9-2 
</P>
<P>
Poly is seeking its 11th consecutive Moore League title and first trip to a 
major division championship game since 1984. The Jackrabbits were upset by San 
Gorgonio in the second round of the playoffs last season after an impressive 
regular season. Co-Coaches Jerry Jaso and Michael Whiting will count on two-way 
starters Richard Washington, Chris Love and Ed Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
11. LOMPOC 
</P>
<P>
Division VII 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 13-1 
</P>
<P>
The Braves will depend on all-Southern Section running back Napolean Kaufman to 
lead them back to the Division VII championship game, after losing to Gardena 
Serra in the final last season. Kaufman, who accounted for 2,954 all-purpose 
yards and 39 touchdowns last season, led the Braves into the title game a year 
ago and then won State track titles in the 100- and 200-meter dashes in the 
spring. Coach Dick Barrett returns 11 starters from last year's Northern League 
champions, including linebacker Jason Grossini and defensive lineman Moose Mau. 
</P>
<P>
12. PARAMOUNT 
</P>
<P>
Division II 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 13-1 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ken Sutch, seeking his third consecutive divisional title, will not have 
Jack Manu, the two-time divisional player of the year, at quarterback. However, 
he will have Leon Neal, who rushed for more than 1,500 yards last season, at 
running back. The Pirates have eight returning starters, including defensive 
back DeMondre White and running back Rolando Avila. 
</P>
<P>
13. CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Division II 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 12-1 
</P>
<P>
Passing is the key at Capistrano Valley, led by quarterback Tony Soliday and 
receiver Dave Polti. The Cougars reached the semifinals last year, losing in 
overtime to Paramount. With 11 starters back, including defensive backs Jeremy 
Brion and Bernie Chapman, Capistrano Valley has a chance to repeat as South 
Coast champion. 
</P>
<P>
14. QUARTZ HILL 
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 6-5 
</P>
<P>
Like rival Canyon Country, Quartz Hill is making the move up to Division I, 
with loads of talent. Coach John Albee returns 15 starters, headed by running 
back/linebacker Selves Smith, an all-league selection last season. Running back 
David Nelson and defensive tackle Ralph Gutierrez also will provide leadership 
for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
15. WESTLAKE 
</P>
<P>
Division II 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 5-6-1 
</P>
<P>
Behind the play of quarterback Todd Preston, who was fourth in passing last 
season in the Southern Section, Westlake will be battling for the Marmonte 
League title. Coach Jim Benkert watched Preston pass for 2,015 yards and 19 
touchdowns last year and is expecting more from him this season.

BURYING THE PAST HELPS HUNTINGTON BEACH BEGIN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it were another day at another school, it might have been a routine football 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Players filed into the physical education building, checked out equipment, said 
hello to teammates and coaches, then sat quietly in front of their lockers. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing unusual about that. 
</P>
<P>
But before the Huntington Beach High School football team could begin the 1990 
season, it had to bury the past one final time. 
</P>
<P>
Each current player who was a member of the 1989 team stood and said a few 
words about what last season meant to him. 
</P>
<P>
The players spoke of winning a share of the Sunset League championship, only 
the third for the school in 27 years, then having it taken away because the 
Oilers used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a league co-championship, an 8-2 overall record and a berth in the 
Southern Section playoff berth, the Oilers made court appearances. They won 
Round 1, but ultimately a judge's restraining order was overturned and the 
Oilers were thrown out of the playoffs again. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 20, the first day the Southern Section allowed teams to practice, the 
Oilers talked about it one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, it's over," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said when it was his 
turn. "That's the last I want to hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
So it is that Huntington Beach, 8-2 overall and 4-1 in league play on the field 
last season, but 0-10, 0-5 in the standings, begins its season. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers play their long-awaited season opener against Corona del Mar, the 
defending Division VI champions, at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Going against a Southern Section champion isn't the way most coaches would like 
to begin their season, but Huntington Beach's case is different. The Oilers 
want to get on with the business of playing football. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk among Sunset League coaches that Huntington Beach again could 
challenge for the league championship. At the very least, the Oilers will 
contend with Edison, Ocean View and newcomer Santa Ana for playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to hear it," Pascoe said. "It's a little premature. Let us play a few 
games, and then I might agree." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach has 24 lettermen, including nine starters, back from last 
season's team. Some league coaches believe the Oilers have something to prove 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach is going to be tough this year," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom 
said. "I think they're on a mission. The kids have got to feel they have 
something to prove. It was kind of a shame. They were a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach had won only two league championships in 27 years when the 
Oilers ran onto Sheue Field for a nonleague opener against Corona del Mar last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar would go on to win the Division VI title. But that night the 
Oilers slugged their way to a 19-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica, Newport Harbor and Long Beach Wilson also fell, and the Oilers took a 
4-0 record into their final nonleague game, against Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach lost that game, but only lost one more and earned a share of 
the Sunset League championship. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration didn't last long, though. The day after the final league game, 
league principals ruled that Huntington Beach must forfeit all eight victories, 
the league co-championship and its berth in the playoffs because the Oilers 
used an ineligible player all season. The player was ruled ineligible for 
failing to fulfill residency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Judge Thomas Thrasher issued a restraining order against the 
Southern Section, which restored the eight victories, the co-championship and 
the playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reporters and TV crews crowded around the players and coaches and 
their family and friends as they left the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
But two days later the Southern Section won the final court battle. Once again, 
the Oilers were out of the playoffs. This time for good. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never take away the record those kids had," Pascoe said. "In their 
hearts it was taken away. I told the kids, 'I have a lot of fond memories from 
last year too. But that's the last I want to hear about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now the Oilers have a chance to erase those memories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great two (now three) weeks of practice," said Pascoe, who sounded 
relieved the new season was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow: Small schools. 
</P>

PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE SUNSET LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Edison 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dave White (fifth year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 10-3, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 10 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: one on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Chip Anderson, DE, 5-10, 170, Sr.; Keith Burke, DB, 6-0, 179, 
Sr.; Scott Boslow, NG, 5-8, 166, Sr.; Mike Cunningham, WR-DB, 6-0, 174, Sr.; 
Brent Hanson, K-P, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Mike Hawks, DB, 5-11, 176, Sr.; Greg 
Schnabel, OT, 6-3, 236, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Kenny Chalabian, DB, 5-8, 159, Sr.; Ryan Blanchard, WR, 6-2, 
177, Sr.; Josh Gingrich, QB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Mark Lamson, DL, 5-9, 169, Jr.; 
J.R. Schusterick, RB, 5-10, 190, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Edison's defense figured to carry the team this season. So far they've 
reinforced that notion. In a 12-0 victory over Honolulu Iolani Friday, the 
Chargers allowed only 25 yards rushing. Six starters return on defense, 
including Cunningham and Hawks, making this a veteran defensive unit. 
Cunningham showed his versatility last week, returning five punts for 81 yards, 
catching six passes for 77 and also getting an interception. Gingrich, who 
completed 11 of 20 passes for 128 yards, has led the Chargers to Sunset League 
titles on the freshman, sophomore and junior varsity levels. However, the 
Chargers must replace 13 all-league players, including quarterback Donnie Smith 
and running back Shane Sherman, from a team that advanced to the Division I 
semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Milner (12th year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 4-7, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 16 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: two on offense, two on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Randy Cowell, DE, 6-2, 215, Sr.; Dave Dardis, DB, 5-7, 155, Sr.; 
Karl Schroller, OT, 6-7, 280, Sr.; Brian Williams, TB, 6-1, 190, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ryan Bertoni, QB, 6-1, 180, Jr.; Derek Capps, OL-DL, 5-11, 215, 
Sr.; Marcos Diaz, QB, 6-1, 180, Sr.; Todd Gordon, P-WR, 6-2, 180, Sr.; Rocky 
Gubernick, WR-DB, 5-9, 170, Jr.; Craig Hurley, C, 6-1, 225, Sr.; Sean Mahony, 
RB-DE, 5-9, 180, Sr.; Tom Nix, K, 5-7, 140, Sr.; Mike Pecen, FB-LB, 5-11, 200,

Bobby Smith, WR-DB, 6-1, 185, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Gone are the days when Fountain Valley attracted 80 to 90 players to 
its varsity team. The Barons have fewer than 40 on the roster, the fewest in 
the 19 years Milner has been at the school. "Depth is going to be crucial," 
Milner said. "If we don't get anybody hurt we're going to be a representative 
football team when league starts. (But) there are a lot of questions. Our 
biggest problems are we're very young and inexperienced." Two years ago, 
Fountain Valley won the Division I championship, 31-24, over Bishop Amat. But 
declining enrollment in the Huntington Beach Union High School District has hit 
Fountain Valley hard. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
Coach: George Pascoe (seventh year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 0-10, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 24 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: five on offense, four on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Don Berger, OL-LB, 6-1, 208, Sr.; Jeff Brentlinger, OL-LB, 6-1, 
220, Sr.; Adrian Brown, WR-DB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Joe Contreras, TB-DB, 5-9, 170, 
Sr.; Robert Griffin, OL-DL, 6-2, 215, Sr.; Gabe Houston, FB-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.; 
Gabe Stupin, TE-LB, 6-1, 200, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Alan Arakaki, WR-DB, 5-9, 155, Sr.; Mike Bolster, OL-DL, 6-2, 
250, Jr.; Adam Bowermaster, RB-DB, 6-0, 185, Sr.; Mike Chavira, QB, 6-1, 175, 
Sr.; Jack Friend, QB, 6-2, 205, Sr.; Scott Jansen, WR-DB, 6-5, 215, Sr.; James 
Mariett, RB-DB, 5-7, 165, Sr.; Garrett Stinson, OL-LB, 6-2, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Offensively, the Oilers will run a balanced, passing and running 
attack. They have three of five offensive linemen back from last year's team. 
"Defensively, we've got to rebuild," Pascoe said. Last year, the Oilers allowed 
only four rushing touchdowns and yielded 108.4 yards rushing per game, a league 
low. Pascoe believes this team could be stingy too. "The defensive line stands 
out," Pascoe said. "The linebackers are great. We're really doing a good job in 
the secondary." Where would Pascoe like to improve? "The kicking game," he 
said. "We need to find a punter. That's everyone's quest. We're going to have 
open tryouts."

Steve Jackson, DB, 6-0, 185, Jr.; John McLoud, OL, 6-0, 225, Jr.; Bob Stewart, 
OL, 6-0, 215, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Last season, the Vikings just wanted to win. A 17-7 nonleague victory 
over Lakewood ended an 18-game losing streak. That accomplished, the Vikings 
are moving toward bigger goals this year. "We want to win some league games and 
make the playoffs," Seeley said. The Vikings relied on the pass last year with 
quarterback David Schultz. This season, they're going to the option with 
McLemore, who played wide receiver last year. Seeley believes the Vikings' 
strength is its running and offensive line. Fulford, a linebacker who was moved 
to the backfield late in the season, and Lewis, a starter last season, will be 
the Viking running backs.

<P>
Ocean View 
</P>

Returning lettermen: 22 
</P>

Jr.; Chad Godfirnon, OL-DL, 6-1, 225, Sr.; Randy Karliner, QB, 6-1 1/2, 200, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Dennis Eichen, WR-DB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Joe Fraser, FB-LB, 5-10, 
180, Jr.; Chris Hooton, WR-DB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Rich Jones, OL-LB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; 
Chris Muat, OL-DL, 6-0, 200, Jr.; Peter Ohm, DB-WR, 5-7, 150, Jr.; Norris 
Perez, LB, 6-0, 180, Sr.; Robert Romine, OL-DL, 5-10, 217, Sr.; Bob Schiel, 
OL-DL, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Garrick Twedt, WR-DB, 5-8, 150, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Seahawks, league co-champions last season, have built their 
offense around two of the league's top players. Karliner, a three-year starter 
at quarterback, threw for 1,622 yards and 17 touchdowns as the Seahawks made 
their first Southern Section playoff appearance. Fanoga caught 21 passes for 
363 yards and three touchdowns. But Isom said the Seahawks' success will hinge 
on their young offensive and defensive lines. "It'll boil down to the guys in 
the trenches," Isom said. Of Karliner, Isom said, "He's one of those guys 
that's fun to sit and watch." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dick Hill (seventh year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 9-3, 4-1 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 20 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: four on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jesse Gomez, OL-DL, 6-0, 230, Sr.; Tommy Gray, OL, 6-0, 220, 
Jr.; Efen Nava, DE-TE, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Albert Perez, QB-DB, 6-1, 170, Sr.; Gus 
Plasencia, K-P, 6-0, 175, Sr.; Al Rivas, RB-DB, 5-10, 180, Sr.; George Salazar, 
OL-DL, 6-1, 265, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Rene Cadena, RB-DB, 5-8, 170, Sr.; Marco Contreras, QB, 5-11, 
180, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Saints have been called a favorite and a playoff contender, and 
then there are the words of one coach, who said, "I have no idea how they'll 
do." Over the past few years, Santa Ana's great team speed and physical ability 
have produced one of the county's most consistent programs. The Saints left the 
Century League having won or shared four consecutive league titles. This year's 
team will miss defender Oscar Wilson, a three-time all-county selection by The 
Times, running back Garner Hicks and quarterback Jesse Rosas. Plasencia is one 
of the most accurate kickers in the county and could give the Saints added 
scoring punch. Rivas showed his potential at running back, gaining 104 yards in 
17 carries in a 38-21 victory over Canyon when Hicks couldn't start because of 
a leg injury. However, he is academically ineligible for the first half of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Stan Clark (second year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 2-8, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 15 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jeff Lancaster, OL-DL, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Christian Moore, WR-DB, 
5-10, 175, Jr.; Ross Rodriguez, RB-DB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Vance Senteno, RB-LB, 
5-11, 175, Sr.; Eric Wilkins, TE-LB, 6-3, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Matt Bailey, QB, 6-0, 165, Jr.; Gabriel Blevins, RB, 5-11, 175, 
Sr.; Kirk Pierce, QB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Myong Kim, DL, 5-10, 170, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Lions missed the playoffs last year for the first time in five 
seasons. It's likely that, barring a string of luck and some unexpected 
performances, the Lions will again miss the playoffs. They started this season 
with a sluggish, 14-7, loss to Robert E. Lee of Springfield, Va., last 
Thursday, giving up the game-winning touchdown in the final minute. Pierce was 
five for nine for 42 yards in his debut at quarterback. Last season, he was the 
understudy to starter John Shipp. Bailey also played in the Lee game as Clark 
searched for some consistency in his offense. Clark, who was co-coach with Jack 
Bowman for two seasons, never found it, however. Senteno, the Lions best player 
and an all-league linebacker, led the team in tackles last season. He also is 
the leading rusher and receiver back from last season's team.

Pat Valenzuela, who missed a mount in Maryland and two racing days here 
recently because of illness, called in sick again Wednesday morning and was 
taken off his eight mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Well on his way to his second consecutive riding title -- he led Kent 
Desormeaux, 50-36, at the start of the day -- after beating Gary Stevens on the 
final day at Hollywood Park, Valenzuela spoke to steward Dave Samuel by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was sick and asked to be taken off his mounts," Samuel said. "He 
didn't sound well, but he did say he wanted to be tested when he comes back." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel said Valenzuela indeed will be asked to take a drug test when he 
returns, presumably today. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to ride Sunny Blossom in the Frank DeFrancis Memorial Dash on Aug. 18 
at Pimlico, Valenzuela called the track's stewards that afternoon and told them 
he was sick and would not be able to fulfill his commitment. He was then taken 
off his mounts the next two days at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing Dr. Neil Fisher in Covina on Aug. 21, the 27-year-old jockey met 
with the stewards the following day, submitted to a drug test -- which came 
back negative -- and was permitted to ride that afternoon. It was determined 
that Valenzuela had been suffering from a virus or food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Steve Schwartz said he expects to make a decision in "a couple of days" 
after a hearing on trainer Ron McAnally's appeal of the stewards' 
disqualification of Tight Spot in the $300,000 Del Mar Derby on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
After he prepares his decision, Schwartz, who was appointed by the California 
Horse Racing Board to hear the matter, will submit it to the CHRB, which will 
then vote either to uphold or to reject the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the Derby, Tight Spot, who beat Itsallgreektome by three lengths, was 
disqualified and placed last for allegedly tightening up the field in the first 
sixteenth of a mile. Itsallgreektome, moved up to first, and Super Abound were 
victimized the most. 
</P>
<P>
However, more than a few observers thought, immediately after the race, that 
Pro for Sure, who was directly inside of Tight Spot coming down the chute, and 
In Excess, were more responsible for the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive viewing of different angles of the start during Wednesday's 2 
1/2-hour hearing seemed to support that argument. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was no testimony from the man with perhaps the best view of the 
incident. Paddock judge Darrel McHargue, who watched the Derby from his usual 
spot in the finish line tower, was asked to testify by Arthur Martin, the 
attorney representing McAnally and owner Verne Winchell. He said he had not 
been served with a subpoena, did not wish to testify and left the room. 
Schwartz said he had no jurisdiction to force McHargue, a former rider, to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
Mort Lipton, representing fellow stewards Hubert Jones and David Samuel, said 
the decision to disqualify Tight Spot was unanimous. "There was exceedingly 
little room between (Tight Spot) and (Pro for Sure)," Lipton said. "(Alex) 
Solis (on Pro for Sure) was defenseless in the matter. (Laffit) Pincay was 
clearly in control and therefore responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who was suspended for five days by the stewards after the 
disqualification, said he simply followed Pro for Sure, who was angling toward 
the rail. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that Pro for Sure started going and I started following him," he 
testified. "We were going very, very slowly, and I kept following him. I wanted 
to make sure I was clear and I could only see (Pro for Sure). I thought I was 
OK because I was clear of that horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Our horses were close, but not that close. I wasn't causing him to go in. I 
was just following him." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay added that he didn't think he deserved to be suspended but didn't appeal 
because he "didn't think I had any chance of beating you guys (the stewards)." 
</P>
<P>
There was also testimony from Solis; McAnally, who had never before appealed a 
disqualification; trainer Charlie Whittingham, who said horses were coming from 
all directions and that, if he were a steward, he wouldn't have known whom to 
disqualify; ex-jockey Bill Harmatz, who said, "In my opinion, Pro for Sure set 
the thing up coming out of the gate and I saw nothing improper from Tight Spot 
or Pincay." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than run Cee's Tizzy in Wednesday's $75,000-added El Cajon Stakes at Del 
Mar, trainer John Russell decided to work him seven furlongs before shipping 
him out for the Super Derby in Louisiana on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Without competition from the son of Relaunch, who ran a mile in 1:33 2/5 on 
Aug. 19, Asia took full advantage, going wire-to-wire to beat favored Warcraft 
by a half-length in 1:41 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Making his second start for Jeff Copland, who had bought him privately for 
owners Marty Nadel, Pete Accardy and Bill Snyder from Claiborne Farm on Aug. 9, 
Asia had chased Cee's Tizzy 2 1/2 weeks earlier, and although beaten by almost 
three lengths, had been well clear of the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon was the third victory in nine starts for the gelded son of Danzig, 
who paid $9.20 as the 7-2 second choice. Warcraft, the even-money choice off 
some good workouts, was second, a half-length ahead of 10-1 shot Shinko Wine. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse came over in very good shape," said Copland, a one-time jockey agent 
who maintains a small stable. "I thought he might make the lead today. He's a 
nice little horse and a tryer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to see Cee's Tizzy come out. I was hopeful because of his last 
race, but it's hard to feel too confident when you have Charlie Whittingham. 
This is my first stakes win." 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon also continued a stakes hot streak for Solis. He has now won three 
in a row after taking the Del Mar Debutante Sunday aboard Beyond Perfection and 
the Del Mar Handicap with Live the Dream Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The trainer didn't tell me much," Solis said. "He just said try to get a good 
position. He was going good for me and felt strong all the way. I took a peek 
at the head of the stretch and saw Chris (McCarron aboard Warcraft) coming with 
those red silks. That's when I asked my horse to run, and he gave it to me." 
</P>

Jockey Rafael Meza became a father for the first time when his wife, Doreen, 
gave birth to Adriana Dominique Wednesday morning at Scripps La Jolla Hospital. 
. . . Pete Accardy, one of the owners of Asia, is the swimming coach at Cal 
State Northridge. . . . Chris McCarron and Russell Baze each rode two winners

The University of Pittsburgh could align with an Eastern all-sports conference 
in six months to two years and would consider leaving the Big East Conference 
to do so, Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik said. 
</P>
<P>
Bozik said the conference options are almost endless -- an expanded Big East; 
an Eastern Seaboard conference that could include West Virginia, Miami, Florida 
State and South Carolina, or a 16-team "super conference" such as the Metro 
Conference.

A federal judge upheld the authority of Fay Vincent for the second time in two 
weeks, forcing a top New York Yankee official to appear at a disciplinary 
hearing before the baseball commissioner today. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand 
rejected a request by Yankee Executive Vice President Leonard Kleinman for a 
temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman wanted to stop Vincent's hearing on his relationship with gambler 
Howard Spira and his role in a $40,000 payment made by the Yankees and George 
Steinbrenner to Spira last January.

VOLLEYBALL SERIES BEGINS FIRST OF SIX NIGHTS AT FORUM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Professional volleyball players from indoors and out will get together for six 
nights of team cup play this month, beginning tonight at 7 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 players -- including two-time Olympians Karch Kiraly, Steve 
Timmons and Dave Saunders, as well as beach volleyball stars Sinjin Smith and 
Randy Stoklos -- will play on the four teams of six players and two alternates 
competing in a round-robin format that concludes Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The other games will be Sunday; Tuesday; Wednesday, Sept. 19, and Saturday, 
Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsorship has grown since the event began five years ago. The $110,000 in 
prize money this season is up 10% from the first year, but is still well below 
the $200,000 in prize money offered by the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals' 
final event on its beach tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be offering more prize money," said Jeannie Buss, event 
coordinator. "But the players have to understand that we can't do that until 
we're making money." 
</P>
<P>
Timmons, who is married to Buss, said: "It's real important for volleyball to 
stay visible between the Olympics and the beach seasons." PETE THOMAS

NEWSWIRE: FTC COULD VOID DEALS BETWEEN ABC AND CFA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against the 
College Football Assn. and Capital Cities-ABC Inc. Wednesday, saying their 
television contracts are anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The five-page complaint, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, 
said competition among schools and networks for college football games has been 
hindered and that "consumers have been deprived of the selection of college 
football games that would otherwise have been televised in a competitive 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The FTC asked that the CFA and Capital Cities appear before an administrative 
law judge on Nov. 13 in Washington. The FTC could void the national television 
contracts and prohibit the CFA from negotiating new deals for all its members. 
</P>
<P>
ABC currently televises games under a contract with the Big Ten and the Pacific 
10 conferences. The CFA's contracts with CBS expire after this season, and the 
CFA is scheduled to begin a new deal with ABC in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA is composed of 64 schools from all major conferences except the Big Ten 
and the Pacific 10. The association announced that the complaint was filed 
after Lew Engman, its Washington lawyer, received the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that the FTC has decided to file a complaint against the 
CFA," the association said in a statement at its Boulder, Colo., office. "Such 
action, however, should not be construed as a finding that the CFA has acted 
unlawfully, but rather as an initiation of the formal hearing process." 
</P>
<P>
ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said the network did not have a comment since 
it had not yet seen the complaint. The FTC scheduled a news conference today to 
discuss the complaint.

DEFENSE PATCHED, SO ROBINSON EYES OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams have been spending most of their time recently trying to patch 
together a defensive unit, but with the return of three defensive holdouts over 
the weekend and the addition of cornerback Mickey Sutton Tuesday, Coach John 
Robinson has had a chance to focus his concern on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning will likely be a factor for former holdouts Kevin Greene, Doug 
Reed and Michael Stewart, but rushing the passer, plugging up holes on the run 
and knowing your spot in a zone defense don't require the precise timing that 
is involved in the Rams' intricate passing game. 
</P>
<P>
So now, Robinson has new things to worry about going into Sunday's season 
opener against the Packers in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Both starting receivers -- Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson -- are coming off 
hamstring injuries that have severely limited their practice time. Ellard has 
caught one pass in exhibition play and Anderson didn't get a reception in an 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about getting started offensively," Robinson said. "The talent is 
coming back, but we've been off the practice field for some time now, and I 
think the timing could be a problem. We're just going to have to be precise and 
efficient offensively to get off to a good start in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't screw the game up and win with the skill level that I think this team 
has, because that skill level has been eroded by injury circumstances and the 
loss of time. I'm worried about those residual negative things that will heal 
themselves in time. I feel good about the football team, but it would be great 
if we had one more week before we opened. I feel that kind of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett will be the one feeling the pressure shortly after the 
opening kickoff Sunday. But Everett, who's so positive he sometimes makes Mr. 
Rogers seem like a pessimist, is doing his best to downplay the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a minimal thing," he said. "It's not like these guys are 
walking in off the street or something. We've had some experience working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it could have some effect, but it shouldn't take more than the first 
quarter or so. . . . only kidding. This week of practice should be enough." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams picked up linebacker Greg Clark off waivers from Green Bay Wednesday. 
Clark, who went to Green Bay as a Plan B player from Miami, will play primarily 
on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson, who has seen his share of films of the Packers' exhibition games 
this week, said Clark, a third-year player from Arizona State, is "a pretty 
good inside linebacker, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' plans to take some pressure off Greene by moving Bill Hawkins to 
weakside tackle, where he would also be a designated pass rusher, have been put 
on hold. Hawkins has been slow to recover from arthroscopic knee surgery he 
underwent in December and is "still playing on a leg and a half," according to 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most disappointing things about training camp to me is that both 
Bill Hawkins and (defensive tackle) Mike Piel have been so slow coming back 
from injuries of last year," Robinson said. "It might be a little bit 
psychological at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Piel is still favoring his left elbow, which was dislocated twice last season. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Faison, the rookie free agent receiver with the nickname "Big Bird," 
continues to be one of Robinson's favorite topics of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely been the most entertaining player in training camp," Robinson 
said. "He's ready to play, but he's not sure what all those numbers mean. I 
mean he's a bright person, he's just still learning the game and learning the 
nuances. He gets excited and doesn't run the patterns precisely the way we want 
him to. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly has the ability to jump and catch the ball, though. We threw a 
pass to him (against Washington) and (cornerback Darrell) Green was covering 
him and Green was about knee high to Big Bird when he went up for that one. 
</P>
<P>
"He can really get up in the air. Over a period of time, he's going to be an 
impressive player in this league, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
All-Pro wide receiver Henry Ellard agreed to a three-year contract extension 
Wednesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. . . . Cornerback Mickey 
Sutton, picked up on waivers from the Buffalo Bills, will start at left corner 
against Green Bay. The Rams considered moving safety Anthony Newman to corner, 
but decided it was best to have as few players as possible playing out of 
position.

Hagerson returns: Lee B. Hagerson returned as head of an Orange County savings 
and loan when regulators recently approved, as expected, the acquisition of 
Universal Savings Bank in Orange by Taiwanese businessman J.S. Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be back in Orange County," Hagerson said after his first two 
weeks on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of good friends, and it's just a nice place to be." 
</P>
<P>
Hagerson, who has 30 years of experience in commercial banking and thrift 
industries, had been an industry consultant in Orange County and was president 
of Westmark Savings Bank in Newport Beach when it was sold three years ago and 
moved to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Hagerson doesn't have a lot to say yet about the direction Universal will take. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot to do. I've got a mountain to climb," he said. "The big thing 
is getting a handle on things, then we'll decide what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
He knows, though, that new owner J.S. Chang, a Taiwanese shoe tycoon, has 
sufficient funds to help the S&amp;L grow. Universal, a healthy thrift with 
eight branches, was sold to Chang for more than $13 million by Unity Corp. Ltd. 
of Sydney, which is run by Australian magnate Garry Carter. He has been 
peddling the thrift ever since regulators seized his institution three years 
ago, alleging that it was about to ship $10 million in loans to him illegally. 
A state court threw the regulators out and returned the thrift to Unity.

CORTEX GETS GRANT FOR DRUG FOR BRAIN CELL REGENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company founded by three neuroscientists from UC 
Irvine, said Wednesday that it has received a federal grant to begin developing 
a drug that may regenerate brain cells destroyed by Alzheimer's disease and 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Cavanaugh, the lead biochemist on the research project at the Irvine 
firm, said the $45,000 grant from the U.S. Public Health Service will fund the 
first phase of study to be completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Cortex, she said, plans to expand upon the laboratory research of Carl W. 
Cotman, a professor of psychobiology at UC Irvine who co-founded the company in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Cotman identified a chemical compound that helps to spur the 
growth of neurons in the brain that are critical to enabling memory and other 
brain functions, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
"These neurons die in people with Alzheimer's disease and after strokes and 
heart attacks, when the blood supply is cut off to the brain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the grant, she said, Cortex will develop and study structurally similar 
compounds in search of one that would have optimum therapeutic value. 
</P>
<P>
"We are testing the compounds on brain neurons in petri dishes to see if they 
help the neurons survive longer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An important advantage of the family of chemical compounds being investigated, 
Cavanaugh said, is that they can be absorbed into the brain through the blood 
system and could be administered as a pill. 
</P>
<P>
If the first phase of research is successful, Cavanaugh said, the company will 
apply for a "second phase" Small Business Innovation Research grant of up to 
$500,000 from the Public Health Service to conduct more extensive laboratory 
tests.

MICROSEMI PLANS TO SELL NON-CORE BUSINESS UNITS; 
</P>
<P>

Microsemi Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to sell some non-semiconductor 
businesses and as a result will take a fourth-quarter charge against earnings 
of $9 million to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to sell five units that are not focused on its core business 
of manufacturing custom chips for the aerospace, military, medical and 
communication industries, said David R. Sonksen, vice president of finance. 
Since last year, the company has been trying to sell its non-core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The write-down will cover costs associated with selling the businesses, the 
sale of some units at prices lower than originally expected, and the 
liquidation of certain business units, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Microsemi said it expects to generate $6 million to $10 million in cash over 
the next year as a result of the asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
Sonksen said the company will sell its Omni Technology unit, a San Jose 
chip-testing company, the Salem/Sertech distribution company in Beverly, Mass., 
and Bikor Corp., a power-supplies firm in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the company has also been trying to sell its Micro Ceramics 
unit in San Diego and Surface Mounted Technology Corp. in San Jose. If the 
sales are completed, Sonksen said, the company's remaining businesses will 
employ about 1,200 people, including 500 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Matheson, an analyst with the Newport Beach investment bank Cruttenden 
&amp; Co., said the write-down was not unexpected because the company has been 
trimming its operations for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a good strategy since the company was getting too far afield 
in areas that weren't beneficial to them," he said. "Now they will start with a 
clean slate." 
</P>
<P>
Matheson estimated that the company will lose $7.5 million on sales of $25 
million for the fourth quarter ending Oct. 1, compared to a loss of $9.4 
million on $25.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter ended July 2, the company posted earnings of $377,000 on 
revenue of $23.6 million, contrasted with a loss of $707,000 on revenue of 
$26.4 million.

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: A CALL FOR BOOKS AND LESS TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompting a call for students to read more and watch rock videos less, national 
average scores of high schools seniors in the verbal portion of the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test declined slightly in 1990, for the fourth year in a row. 
Meanwhile, the average math score did not change. 
</P>
<P>
The two main parts of the SAT are scored on a scale of 200 to 800. This year's 
three-point drop in verbal SAT scores, to 424, puts that average back to its 
lowest in two decades, compared to 463 in 1969. The 476 average in math has not 
changed over four years and remains 17 points below the 1969 average, although 
it is 10 points better than 1980, which had the worst average in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Disturbing but not particularly surprising," was the way Donald M. Steward, 
president of the College Board, which sponsors the SAT, described the 1990 
national verbal scores. In a statement accompanying the scores' release 
recently, Steward refered to a recent study that showed high school seniors on 
the average spend at least three hours a day watching television and read 10 or 
fewer pages of any written material. 
</P>
<P>
"Students must pay less attention to video games and music videos and begin to 
read more," Steward said. "Reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among 
too many American students -- and that would be a national tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
California's 1990 averages on the nation's most widely used college admissions 
examination were 419 in verbal, down three points from last year, and 484 in 
math, unchanged from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Verbal scores in Orange County ranged from an average of 348 in the Santa Ana 
Unified School District to 457 in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. In 
math, average scores in the county ranged from 449 in Santa Ana to 543 in the 
Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In districts where the average verbal score fell below the state average, 
officials attributed the lower scores to an increasing number of seniors who 
speak English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of nonwhites among SAT-takers this year in California was 49%, 
up from 35% in 1984 and sharply higher than this year's national nonwhite 
representation of 27%. Although they have increased their scores significantly 
in the last 15 years, minority groups generally do worse on the SAT than 
Anglos, except for Asian-Americans on math. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite that ethnic representation, California students were only five 
points below the national verbal average. Californians scored eight points 
above the national math average, boosted partly by the Asian representation -- 
22% of California SAT-takers, compared to 8% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Critics allege that biases built into the test cause score gaps between men and 
women and between Anglos and most minorities. But the College Board says those 
differences are caused by educational and economic backgrounds of students and 
their parents.

SUMMER JOBS' EXTRA VALUE; 
</P>
<P>
TEEN-AGERS GAIN SELF-ESTEEM, INDEPENDENCE, MONEY SKILLS BY WORKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

contributor to High Life.

<P>
While nations talk war in the Middle East, Molly Mazur learned how to make 
peace by working as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are fighting, that is just no good," said the 17-year-old Orange 
High School senior, who works at Coco's restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually on my shift there's eight to 10 waitresses, and if some of them have a 
problem with each other, then it makes it terrible," Mazur said. "Because when 
people are fighting it doesn't go as smoothly as it should. I've really learned 
how to try to make everyone happy." 
</P>
<P>
Low-paying, non-mentally taxing jobs such as waitressing have long been 
standard summer fare for teen-agers. Now, as the school year begins and teens 
spend six hours a day gazing out windows and thinking back on the past summer, 
many are realizing that those jobs have given them more than just a weekly 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sheila Vaughn, a UC Irvine professor who teaches adolescent psychology and 
counsels young people, pointed out a few of the often overlooked benefits of 
teen-agers' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a lot of things that kids are supposed to be doing during 
adolescence," Vaughn said, "that they get to do with a summer job -- trying out 
different roles, getting some independence, building their self-esteem, and 
learning some real practical things like money handling. 
</P>
<P>
"The jobs that you might think are mindless might not be mindless at all for 
someone who wanted to go into retail or a job dealing with children." 
</P>
<P>
Katie Teepe, 16 and an El Toro High School senior, spends about 25 hours a week 
as a customer service representative at the Wet Seal clothing and accessories 
store in Laguna Hills. She sees her job as a chance to practice skills useful 
for a career. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really want to do is go into advertising, and what I really like is 
public speaking," she said. "So this is kind of a different way of advertising 
-- persuading people to buy things that fit their needs. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn so much about customer service and about how to make something look 
better than it really is." 
</P>
<P>
Teepe, like Mazur, has also learned to cope with fellow employees. "You work 
there, and you're not leaving, so you just have to learn to deal with all the 
different personalities who work there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jake Marvel, 17, learned a big lesson in dealing with diverse personalities 
while working at a day care center in El Toro this summer. With the help of 
nine other counselors, the senior and student body president at Mission Viejo 
High School worked 40 hours a week organizing activities for children ages 5 to 
11. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about patience and a lot about people and being in charge," he 
said. "I found out that I could be the leader of the kids and the kids could 
still like me." 
</P>
<P>
Mazur, who has worked as a waitress about 15 hours a week since January, 
pointed out the importance of getting along with others while on the job. "A 
job is a lot different from your normal life where you can do whatever you 
want, say whatever you want, to anybody. Then, whatever you do just reflects on 
you. But whatever I do at work reflects on my job." 
</P>
<P>
She finds that her behavior is especially important when serving customers. 
"One of the most important things I've learned is how to deal with people in a 
tight situation. If something is wrong with their order or something's wrong 
with the service, I've learned how to compensate for it, just by making the 
guests happy." 
</P>
<P>
Learning responsible behavior is one of the main benefits, Vaughn said, for a 
teen-ager with a summer job. "(Teens) learn what it means to be responsible -- 
to fulfill their chores, to be there on time, to get themselves back and 
forth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Katie agreed that her job has probably taught her to be more responsible. "When 
you get your schedule for work, it's like everything else revolves around that 
schedule," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Eric Brown, an 18-year-old senior at Santa Margarita High School, 
responsibility meant more than a cheery attitude, a clean uniform, or even 
getting to work on time. As a lifeguard this summer and last at Wild Rivers 
water park in Irvine, he had to protect people's lives. "You can't fall asleep 
on the job," he said, "because anything can happen any time, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Job responsibilities, Vaughn said, can give teen-agers a boost of self-esteem. 
"They start to feel good about themselves if they see themselves succeeding, 
especially for an adolescent who doesn't work hard in school." 
</P>
<P>
While Brown plays football and takes honors classes, he has special pride in 
his job skills, too. "You're a professional when you're a lifeguard," he said. 
"You have special training. Before I worked here, I didn't realize that 
lifeguards put in so many hours learning the job they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
His lifeguard training taught him first aid, life-saving techniques such as 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and how to deal with a panic-stricken person in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that I could handle life-threatening situations and that I could 
think fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After breaking his leg playing football the last week in July, Brown moved from 
the pools to the office, where he picked up a few people-skills, too. "I 
learned how much work it takes to get people to come when people call in sick." 
</P>
<P>
Like much of Brown's office work, Teepe's job relies on her persuasive powers. 
She said that even though she makes extra money if she sells a certain dollar 
amount of clothes, she cannot tell a customer that an outfit flatters her if it 
does not. So, she has developed tact and the ability to think on her feet as 
she suggests different styles and sizes for indecisive patrons. She said she 
has learned how to use such lines as, "Well, personally, I like my jeans a 
little bit baggier" instead of "Those jeans are skintight and look gross." 
</P>
<P>
In this way, Teepe said, even working as a sales clerk in a clothing store has 
kept her mentally on her toes. She has also learned the physical demands of 
staying on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see people in a clothing store, you don't realize that they're on 
their feet all day, eight hours a day, and they have to be friendly with people 
eight hours a day. (The sales clerk) can't go in there with a bad attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Teepe learned another hard fact of the working world this summer: "You learn 
how to save your paycheck," she said. Right now, she is saving for college 
spending money. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn said that however difficult it may be to save money, doing so makes 
teens feel good about themselves. "It gives them confidence. They think, 'If I 
want something I can get it. If I want a car, I can save up money, and I can 
get a car.' Jobs make adolescents feel more independent, which is really 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Besides giving teens responsibility, a chance to manage money and a sense of 
independence, summer jobs can challenge high school students in ways not 
available in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Most summer jobs do not require the high-intensity training of lifeguarding, 
but almost all require some specialized skill or knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Waitressing does take something of a strategy," Mazur said. "It's like playing 
checkers." She has learned to juggle the time between courses, carry the plates 
so no food falls, and memorize details of customers' orders. 
</P>
<P>
While Teepe mastered the routine of waiting on customers within a week or so of 
starting her job, she is still learning about clothing fabrics and styles. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn a lot about synthetic fabrics and about how they handle when they're 
being washed and worn. That's usually what the customer wants to know: 'Is it 
going to shrink and will it fall apart after I wash it?' 
</P>
<P>
"You learn a lot about new things coming out and about names for clothes that 
if you just walked into a store you wouldn't be able to say, 'Oh, that's a baby 
doll (a shirt that flairs out at the bottom).' Everyday I learn something new 
about a different style of clothing." 
</P>
<P>
In the day care world of real baby dolls, art projects and board games, Marvel 
said he picked up quite a bit of knowledge about children. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about how much little kids are underrated," he said. "People 
think they're really stupid, but they're not. I talked to a lot of bright kids 
that were fun to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
One of the tricks of dealing with children that he learned was to let them know 
the rules. Like any good elementary school teacher, he would spend the first 
day of each two-week session acting somewhat stern to show them who was in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
To teach rules, he said, "I would make examples of when kids got hurt, and I 
would find a rule that they had broken. I'd make up a rule if I had to, so that 
(the kids) would know they had done something wrong. But I also had to do it so 
I didn't hurt their feelings. It's a delicate balance."

For Richard Williams, 26, a blind history major at Cal State Northridge, taking 
class notes used to be a tedious project. After tape-recording a lecture, he 
would transcribe the material using a Braille typewriter -- a process that took 
about three hours for every hour he spent in class. 
</P>
<P>
Then Williams got a laptop computer, and the Computer Access Lab at CSUN got a 
Braille embosser. After that, the senior could take notes directly on his 
laptop (equipped with a voice synthesizer and headphones) and then "dump" the 
notes into the embosser for a Braille printout. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is one of 210 students registered with the Computer Access Lab, a 
2-year-old facility designed to help CSUN students graduate and get jobs with 
the assistance of technology. 
</P>
<P>
Available to any disabled CSUN student who signs up with the Office of Disabled 
Student Services, the lab has helped 680 students with visual limitations, 
communication disorders, physical disabilities and learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The lab serves as a temporary resource and training ground while students get 
what they need for themselves. Williams is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done my very best to get as much of my own equipment as possible, or at 
least have access to it," he said. "Where I work, at the Los Angeles Air Force 
Base, in the history office, we are ordering a Braille embosser." 
</P>
<P>
For Terri Shallenberger, 22, a communicative disorders major who will be a 
senior in the fall, the Computer Access Lab's pragmatic approach to computer 
modifications has had tangible results. 
</P>
<P>
With hand and finger movements severely limited by a condition called 
arthrogryposis, she hadn't typed much before. ("I had a class in junior high, 
and I typed with my hands, but it was really slow -- really, really slow.") 
</P>
<P>
Then the Computer Access Lab rigged up an inexpensive bracket to hold a 
computer keyboard in a vertical position level with her feet. Pieces of plastic 
spoons were glued to the keyboard to identify the home row. Now, when she wants 
to type, Shallenberger uses her big toes in a modified form of hunt and peck. 
</P>
<P>
She's still training (using a standard program called Typing Tutor), but the 
new approach has helped. "It was the difference between 14 words a minute and 
25," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And as a result of her new typing skills, Shallenberger received a promotion in 
her job at the University Student Union, where she uses a wooden stand made by 
a friend to support a modified keyboard. She feels confident that other 
employers would be willing to make similar modifications "because it's so 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
The Computer Access Lab is a component of the Technology Group, a larger 
network of technological resources intended to improve the lives of disabled 
CSUN students. Other important components include an annual international 
conference on Technology and Persons with Disabilities, training in what its 
practitioners call assistive technology for rehabilitation professionals and 
employers (offered through a grant from the Rehabilitation Services 
Administration), and engineering research and development in assistive 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Scott, engineer/programmer and assistive technology specialist, heads a 
special project, funded by another federal grant, to develop a universal access 
system that will allow disabled students to use any computer at the Northridge 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
At present, for example, Williams can use only certain computers at the lab, 
because only those computers are equipped to work with his particular 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
"The universal-access concept is to make each computer have an interface that 
can work with devices that the disabled people carry around with them, which we 
call 'accessors,' " Scott said. That way, "you're able to interact with any 
computer because you bring all your special stuff with you." 
</P>
<P>
Under a grant from the Department of Rehabilitation, CSUN is also developing a 
laptop computer system for people with learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Computer Access Lab houses about $400,000 worth of equipment, according to 
Dr. Marshall Raskind, coordinator of the Learning Disability Program and the 
Computer Access Lab. Included are voice recognition systems, speech 
synthesizers, modified keyboards, special switches and augmented communication 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
Initially financed with a grant from the state Department of Rehabilitation, 
funding has come from a number of agencies and corporations, including Apple 
Computer, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But equipment ages fast in the technology field, and keeping up is a constant 
challenge. Part of the effort involves seeking appropriate donations from 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We go after things that we need," Scott said, "but we don't have as many 
things as we really want -- yet -- because a lot of the specialized equipment, 
the companies that make that, are too small to be able to make big donations." 
So a lot of the progress has to come through adaptations to standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Scott's Think and Do Group comes in. A group of community 
volunteers with an interest in technological solutions, its purpose "is to 
bring resources, in terms of manpower for software and development, that you 
couldn't get any other way," Scott said. He said he also has six students 
involved in projects "where the outcome will be something for disabled people 
to use." 
</P>
<P>
Ideas for Think and Do Group projects will come in part from Scott, training 
specialist Diane Bristow, and Gail Pickering, a full-time assistive technology 
specialist working with the Computer Access Lab. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we have to deal with don't have resources to have exotic 
solutions," Scott said. "So we're always having to look at what are the 
practical solutions in terms of the cost, the ruggedness, the availability of 
the components. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Scott looks for ways to make existing technology adaptable to new situations, 
such as using something developed for blind people with students who have 
learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Scott said, "We're always looking for things that are mass produced or 
used in industry that could be carried across into the disability field." 
</P>
<P>
For example, standard fiber-optic tubes used by industry can be mounted on a 
pair of glasses and adapted to sense eye movements in a way that acts as a 
switch to operate a computer. A fiber-optic tube costs about $35, Scott said. 
"For me to go through and create something like that would cost significantly 
more than $35." 
</P>
<P>
The Computer Access Lab's second-year grant from the Department of 
Rehabilitation ran out June 13. From now on, the university will provide funds. 
Students such as Terri Shallenberger know that the money is well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"Computers are so widely used," she said, "that anybody who gets the 
opportunity is going to do really well once they get out of here."

BARGAINS: TRACKING DOWN TODAY'S ATHLETIC SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chances are your children know exactly what kind of shoes they want for school. 
Unless they never look at television, close their eyes when they pass a 
billboard, don't read magazines or newspapers and experience no peer pressure, 
their choices usually lean toward the high-end stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Shoes can be the most expensive single item on the back-to-school list, a fact 
that anyone over 40 finds hard to comprehend. Sneakers for $130? But they 
aren't called "sneakers" and certainly not "tennies" anymore. They are 
"athletic shoes" of leather not canvas and the price tags range from high to 
outrageous. Boots can run even more. 
</P>
<P>
If Michael can't show his face that first day of school without a pair of 
Magics, head for the Converse Factory Store (423 S. Lincoln Blvd. in Venice) 
where the shoes endorsed by the Lakers' No. 32 sell for $50 instead of the 
usual $70 to $80. Converse's other popular designs are the ERX 260 and ERX 360, 
which retail for $80 and $109, respectively, but are tagged here at $44.99 and 
$59.99. 
</P>
<P>
If Michelle has her heart set on L.A. Gear Brats, then head for Price Busters 
Shoe Warehouse (5100 E. Whittier, Los Angeles) where you can get two pair for 
$50, unless you'd rather lay out $40 to $45 each somewhere else. The "two-fers" 
here are an excellent deal and include brands such as Vans, Pony, Adidas, Avia, 
Kangaroo and L.A. Gear -- but only certain models. Reebok's Showtime is $29.99 
instead of $50, Air Jordan is $60 instead of $85. Nike's Quantum Force has a 
solid price of $29.99, not the $45 some places get. 
</P>
<P>
Price Busters is set back behind a parking lot on Vancouver Street and is not 
too visible from the street, but it's worth the search. The store sells only 
athletic shoes. Although this looks like a small store from the front, you're 
in for a 4,000-square-foot surprise. It's self-serve, well-organized and there 
are bilingual clerks to help if you need it. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty-corner from the Sun Valley site of the Price Club is Shoes Here (10951 
Sherman Way) with excellent deals on some of the big names the kids want. 
Reebok's Club Champion is priced well at $29.98 (retails at other spots from 
$40 to $45) for boys and girls. Several styles of Jordache for both sexes are 
$29.98 instead of $45. If, by some chance, Michael or Michelle are pushing for 
boots, Shoes Here has the Dingo boots for $69 to $100 (retail $100 to $160), or 
35% to 40% off. Granny boots (retail $90) are $49.90 and the Equestrian boot is 
also $49.50 (retail $100). 
</P>
<P>
For those individualists who prefer work shoes, the 9-West oxfords are $29 to 
$38 instead of the usual $60 plus. 
</P>
<P>
All of these stores carry children's sizes 8 1/2 to 13, and 13 1/2 to 2 1/2 in 
youth sizes.

LAW ENFORCEMENT: COMMUNITY GROUPS FEAR LOSING THE ABILITY TO REVIEW BRUTALITY 
COMPLAINTS AS THE CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO HIRE 46 DEPUTIES TO AUGMENT THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council's decision this week to hire sheriff's deputies to patrol 
parts of the city met with overwhelming opposition from several community 
groups afraid of losing the ability to review complaints of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 2 Tuesday to hire 46 Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies to patrol about a fifth of the city until 1994, a move they said will 
provide immediate relief for a burgeoning crime problem and an understaffed 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
When the deputies hit Long Beach streets Oct. 15, they will free 43 officers 
working in the northeastern and northernmost areas to patrol other parts of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"The cry I've been hearing is for more police, and that cry is deafening," 
Mayor Ernie Kell said. "We are badly understaffed, and this will give us an 
opportunity to build up." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Ray Grabinski and Clarence Smith dissented, both arguing that the 
plan was pushed through with insufficient public comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard more debate over a contract for damned typewriters than I've heard 
on this $5-million contract," Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
It is customary to refer proposals to council committees for public discussion. 
Tuesday was the first time that details of the deputies proposal were publicly 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's main objection was repeated over and again Tuesday by residents and 
representatives of several community groups. They opposed the plan because it 
will mean that the newly formed Citizen Police Complaint Commission will not be 
able to review brutality complaints against the deputies, who are county 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The civilian police review board is a tremendous asset to the community and 
should not be circumvented," said Jack Castiglione of the predominantly gay 
Long Beach Lambda Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an effort to get rid of" the review board, said Ernie McBride of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that voters approved creation of the commission last April, Renee 
Greenfield, president of the Long Beach League of Women Voters, told the 
council: "Can the City Council negate a vote for a charter amendment? I'm 
puzzled." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Lowenthal, president of the Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, echoed 
similar concerns and questioned whether the council is ignoring a mandate by 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the community to be respected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Officers Assn. cited similar concerns and joined representatives of 
the black and gay communities, who had long complained of racism and harassment 
by Long Beach officers, to ask the council to keep the department's officers 
where they are. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. John Hammargren, who oversees contract law enforcement, said 
his agency's policy is to investigate all citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"We objectively evaluate the findings," said Sheriff's Division Chief Ray 
Morris, who oversees the southeast region of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies have a good relationship with the gay community in West Hollywood, 
Hammargren and Morris told the council. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Tracy, president of the police union, was not convinced. The union 
supported the Citizen Police Complaint Commission. Tracy said the plan, 
believed to be the first in California to pair two law enforcement agencies in 
one city, will be demoralizing to the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, Police Chief Lawrence Binkley has referred comments on 
controversial matters to City Manager James C. Hankla. Binkley was not present 
at the council meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argued that the need for more police is immediate. "We're in the 
midst of a crisis. It's a crisis in crime," Councilman Wallace Edgerton said. 
</P>
<P>
As crime has continued to increase, the number of officers on the street has 
dipped. Although the department is budgeted for 691 officers, it has 580 
working, according to Assistant Police Chief Gene Brizzolara. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 59 vacancies, 52 officers are on leaves of absence because of 
injuries and other reasons, he said. And although the department has chosen its 
next set of 12 recruits to begin training Oct. 8, it expects to lose 43 
officers eligible to retire in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The state recommends officers have 33% of their time uncommitted to patrol," 
Brizzolara said. "The way we're operating, they have none. They're either on 
calls or backlogged." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters who addressed the council Tuesday noted that the plan will mean more 
police officers throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It will free up more police officers for my neighborhood," said Mike Donelon, 
a resident of California Heights. Deputies assigned to North Long Beach will 
enable the department to redeploy officers to Donelon's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lamond, a resident of one of the districts that will be patrolled by 
sheriff's deputies, told the council: "I do think we have an urgent need for 
more police in other parts of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Hankla reminded the council and the audience that the plan is a temporary one, 
with the sheriff's deputies to be phased out over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies will patrol north of Market Street and north of Spring Street, 
east of Lakewood Boulevard. They will work out of the Long Beach Police 
Academy, with the command staff based at the sheriff's station in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of deputies for the rest of the 1990-91 fiscal year is $3.8 million, 
according to a report by Hankla. The cost for 12 months of service is $5.4 
million. The 46 positions are in addition to other booking, jailing and 
detective services. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of one sheriff's deputy is $213,000 annually; a Long Beach police 
officer costs $288,000. The price tag for a deputy is lower in part because 
counties are prohibited by state law from charging cities for some services, 
according to Hankla. 
</P>
<P>
The city is paying for the deputies with revenue from a recently adopted 
utility tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The term of the contract is from Oct. 15 to June 30, 1994. Either party may 
terminate the agreement by giving 60 days' notice. The Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors must also approve the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the plan were Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude, Tom Clark, Doug 
Drummond, Wallace Edgerton and Jeff Kellogg. Councilmen Les Robbins and Warren 
Harwood were disqualified from voting because they are county employees.

CENSUS DASHES LATINO HOPES FOR SEAT ON ENLARGED COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Latino leaders said they are disappointed over unexpectedly low population 
totals reported for the city last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino community had hoped that preliminary census data would show a 
population of more than 100,000, which would result in the expansion of the 
City Council and give Latinos a better chance of winning a council seat for the 
first time, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the Compton City Charter, the five-member council must be 
expanded to seven members when the city's population reaches 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, preliminary census data released last week shows that the population 
count fell far short of the necessary 100,000. The U.S. Census Bureau put 
Compton's total population at 86,999, up 7% from the 1980 figure of 81,286. 
</P>
<P>
"That can't be, because, if you look at the school district, it's growing," 
said veteran Latino activist Joseph Ochoa. "I'm pretty sure we've got to be 
over 100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Pallon, a local bakery owner and founding member of the Latino Chamber of 
Commerce, said: "I was very disappointed. We were counting on 100,000 at least. 
I think there's been an undercount, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
There is a heavy concentration of Latinos in Compton's northeast corner, as 
well as along its eastern edge, and Latinos believe that they might be able to 
mount a winning council campaign from there. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are elected at large, although they are required to be 
residents of the district from which they are running. Ideally, Latino leaders 
would like to force a charter change that requires council members to be 
elected by the residents of a district. For such a change to take place, 
however, the city voters would have to approve a charter change. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau has not yet announced the racial breakdown in city 
populations, but there is little doubt that the city's Latino population has 
mushroomed during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time, Latino youngsters reached a majority in the 
Compton schools. They represented 50.3% of the enrollment, compared to only 
about 33% five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the city, various estimates from census tracking research firms put the 
overall Latino population at about 33% to 35%, up about 10% to 12% from 1980. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Compton Unified School District takes in large tracts of 
county-controlled areas that are not within city boundaries, and the county 
areas are heavily Latino. 
</P>
<P>
In response to its growing Latino population, Compton has hired some 
Spanish-speaking workers in order to communicate with all its residents. The 
Police Department, for example, had to hire Spanish-speaking dispatchers in 
order to take emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, however, have been agitating for more Latino hiring in the school 
district and the city and demanding that both adopt affirmative action hiring 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and Pallon said they had no plans to challenge the census data and will 
wait to see what action the city itself takes over the lower-than-expected 
count. 
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist, the city may use its growing Latino population as evidence 
when it challenges the federal count. There is no doubt that the Latino 
population has grown over the last 10 years, Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, Moore suggested, many Latinos are recent immigrants and were afraid to 
respond to the census questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they also were stunned by the low census figures and will 
challenge them. The process is known as the post census local review and gives 
cities an opportunity to present evidence that the Census Bureau figures are 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The state Department of Finance has had us up over 93,000 for about three 
years," city planner Barbara Kilroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the state and federal money, such as gasoline and sales tax revenues, 
that cities receive is based on population. If Compton cannot prove that it has 
the 93,000 people attributed to it by the state Department of Finance, then the 
city could lose some funding, said Jerry Gadt, city planning manager. He is in 
charge of preparing the city's challenge to the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Gadt said he is poring over tax records from the county assessor's office in 
hopes of showing that the number of dwellings in Compton has risen. The 
household figures, Gadt said, are one measure used to challenge Census Bureau 
population figures. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Howard Caldwell said: "I understand they have been undercounting 
all over the state. We have enough data here to show that they severely 
undercounted our population (increase) over the 10-year period." 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said that the city sells water to all the households and that his 
staff is compiling data to show that the number of households has risen 
steadily over the last decade. He also said that billings from the city's 
sanitation contractor will show that the number of households in the city has 
risen.

Margaret DeBold spends most of her days riding up and down in a five-foot-wide 
box. DeBold, 75, runs one of the last manually operated passenger elevators in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to type or be a secretary. This is my little world and I have 
control of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who ride with her in the Professional Building at 8th Street and Pine 
Avenue say she serves as a reminder of a bygone era of less automation and more 
human interaction. 
</P>
<P>
DeBold, who has been operating an elevator in the building since 1962, knows 
all the occupants and what floor they work on. She has keys to most of the 
offices and frequently opens doors for delivery people when the occupants are 
out. She often passes along messages between tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Although her shift officially begins at 6 a.m., she says, she generally arrives 
an hour earlier to feed the stray cats in back of the building and polish the 
brass in her elevator. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in this building is like being in a little time machine," said Anthony 
Hall, 35, manager of a professional writing service in the eight-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Skelton, chairman of the city's Cultural Heritage Commission, said riding 
in DeBold's elevator "is a nostalgic experience. It takes you to an era of 
luxury and glamour that doesn't exist anymore except in theater and books." 
</P>
<P>
During most of that era, elevator operators sat on stools, wore spiffy uniforms 
and responded to riders' requests. Uniforms have not been required for 15 
years, DeBold said, but she still prefers wearing the burgundy dress and brown 
jacket that once were the mark of her trade. 
</P>
<P>
DeBold, a native of Brooklyn, got her first elevator job in 1934 at the age of 
20 and has been leading a life of ups and downs ever since. In 1960 she moved 
to Long Beach with her mother and brother and, two years later, went to work in 
the Professional Building with an aunt who had been operating elevators there 
since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Her elevator, one of two in the building, reflects the grace of the period. 
Lined with wood interiors and shiny brass handrails, it still is equipped with 
the panels of green and white lights that once directed operators to the floors 
where passengers awaited. 
</P>
<P>
The light panels no longer work, having been replaced long ago by a more 
sophisticated system that sounds a buzzer and displays a floor number each time 
an elevator is called. 
</P>
<P>
But operators still move the elevators by spinning brass wheels, aligning the 
elevators with each floor and then pulling open the doors. An antique rotary 
telephone also remains in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The building's owner, Southwest Securities, considered switching to automatic 
elevators when it purchased the structure in 1979, Southwest co-owner John 
Packard said. "But we felt that it would take away from the charm," he said. 
"We look upon the elevator operators almost as security guards. It's probably 
not economically efficient on paper, but it pays off in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
One of the ways it pays off, he said, is in the special services the elevator 
operators such as DeBold provide the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a great lady," said Robert W. Evans, an attorney who has worked in the 
building for 16 years. "Most of my clients like the reassurance of having a 
live person operating the elevator." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Baker, 37, who now owns a publishing company housed in the building, said 
he first met DeBold when he was 10 years old and making trips to his dentist in 
the same building. "I joke with her a lot," Baker said. "It's nice to walk in 
and be able to talk to someone." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Ojeda, who has only five months' experience operating the elevators, 
fills in to lift late-night visitors to their destinations. "When I started 
here this was the first human-operated elevator I'd ever seen," said Ojeda, 37, 
a part-time musician. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, according to DeBold, the same can be said of many of her 
passengers "They come right in front of me and try to push a button," she said. 
"I tell them there are no buttons to push; I'm the automation." 
</P>
<P>
DeBold says her shoulders are beginning to ache from pushing the elevator door 
open by hand, her feet often hurt because she stands for long periods in the 
tiny compartment, and that her mind sometimes wanders. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like an antique," she said. "I'm surprised that I've been able to work 
this long. I never thought I'd be the last elevator operator." 
</P>
<P>
DeBold said she recalls being stuck only once -- in an automated elevator in a 
hospital last year. She was freed after an hour, she said, but has vowed never 
to ride in an automated elevator again. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some major changes are in store at the Professional Building, which was 
built in 1929 in the Art Deco style. 
</P>
<P>
With occupancy at only 70% because of a glut of office space in downtown Long 
Beach and recent disruptions from construction of the nearby Metro Rail Blue 
Line, Packard said, his company has decided to convert the building into 
low-cost housing for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the company would like to retain at least one of the manually 
operated elevators. "We think the seniors will like that," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
And DeBold says she wants to keep working as long as she can.

APPEAL ON ZIP CODE POLICY GETS ONLY 2 VOTES AND FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the fact that Compton has several ZIP codes, the City Council rejected 
an appeal from Councilwoman Jane Robbins to support federal legislation that 
would make ZIP code boundaries the same as city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff backed Robbins' request, saying the inconsistency causes 
emergency service confusion and significantly affects apportionment of federal, 
state and local revenues. Vice Mayor Maxcy D. Filer voted against the 
resolution and Councilwoman Patricia Moore abstained. Councilwoman Bernice 
Woods supported Robbins' motion. Mayor Walter R. Tucker was absent.

COUNCIL HEARS COMPLAINTS ON LIENS FOR WEED CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30 disgruntled Compton homeowners packed the City Council chamber 
Tuesday to protest liens placed on their properties by the city for weed 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners said they were not notified that the city was going to clean 
their properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some said that they have been billed but that their properties have not been 
cleaned. The council said it would check out the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Charles Davis said that all the cases were heard by the Housing 
Advisory Appeals Board and that the property owners, many of whom do not live 
in the city, were notified by registered mail that they had to clean their 
property or the city would do it. Public Works Department officials and private 
contractors did the cleanups, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homeowners brought evidence, such as photographs showing that their 
yards were clean, to substantiate their claims but public works officials did 
not have documentation for the council members. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that there were more than 500 notices totaling $500,000 in fines and 
liens sent out during the summer and that it would involve a lot of work to 
review every case.

Photo, One of the most popular events at the International Twins Assn. 
convention in Long Beach last weekend was a contest with judging for most alike 
(and unalike) pairs in various age categories. Among boys through age 5 were 
Brent and Eric Besson, 5, from left above, from Santa Monica and Anthony and 
Joseph Montoya, 4, of Long Beach. The Besson twins won in their age group; the 
Montoyas were second. Other categories were oldest, youngest and those who 
traveled farthest. Although they may hold their cameras differently, at left, 
most everything else about Gigi and Angie Whitlow, 25, of Atlanta is identical. 
More than 200 sets of twins from throughout the United States gathered at the 
Hyatt Regency for the 56th convention of the nonprofit, family-oriented 
organization that promotes spiritual, intellectual and social welfare of twins. 
In addition to the look-alike contests, there were trips to area tourist 
attractions, a formal dinner-dance, golf tournament, barbecue, mini-Olympics 
and business meetings. SARAH M. BROWN

<P>
BINGO LICENSE NOT RENEWED; 7-DAYS-A-WEEK PLAY DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite protests that Cudahy's bingo ordinance is unconstitutional, the City 
Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to deny renewal of a bingo license held by 
a Compton businessman who wants to operate games seven days a week in town. 
</P>
<P>
The council said the application of John Mgrdichian failed to meet requirements 
of the state Penal Code and the city's bingo ordinance that was passed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Among the requirements set by the ordinance are that bingo games can be held 
only once a week for no more than eight hours and must be hosted by a nonprofit 
agency whose board of directors and membership consist of a majority of Cudahy 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian, as director of the Social Service Foundation, was granted a license 
last year under conditions of the old bingo ordinance, which was far less 
restrictive. Although he has held the license for a year, Mgrdichian has not 
built the bingo parlor in which he proposed to hold games to benefit nonprofit 
social service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council, Mgrdichian's attorney, Barry A. Fisher, wrote that 
the changes in the bingo ordinance are unconstitutional and "unfair and 
discriminatory and appear to be aimed at the foundation, which is the only 
group in the city that has applied for a multi-night bingo ordinance."

NEW WAVES, NEW TACK FOR BEACH BOYS; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: POP GROUP WILL RAISE MONEY FOR AN AMERICA'S CUP SYNDICATE. THEY AIM AT 
'92 CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's go sailin' now, everybody's learnin' how . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those natty cats in blue blazers who run the America's Cup nearly fell off 
their deck chairs a couple of months ago, when a 1939 Ford Woody with 
surfboards on top pulled up in front of the yacht club. Five men jumped out, 
kicked the sand off their feet and asked where they could go to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it wasn't quite like that, but the imagery plays well. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking fantasy here, and after all, much of what the rest of the world 
knows about California was influenced from the early 1960s, when the Beach 
Boys' recorded musical hits started rolling in like the waves at Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing was the craze, now the Boys can slide gracefully into middle age and 
their natural transition: sailing. Change a word here, a beat there and it's 
all the same warm sun and salty air: 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's gone sailin', Sailin' USA . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Beach Boys' USA syndicate is one of three groups hoping to win the right to 
defend the Cup for the San Diego Yacht Club in trials scheduled to start in 
January 1992. There were four until Peter Isler's team dropped out Aug. 29, and 
the remainder -- Dennis Conner, Larry Klein and the Beach Boys -- each must 
show a $6-million stack of chips by Oct. 1 to stay in the game. Eventually, 
each will need about $15 million to play in this terribly expensive game. 
</P>
<P>
Conner already has his $6 million, and it wouldn't seem to be a serious order 
for one of the most successful musical groups ever, except that the Boys don't 
have a royalty of their own invested in the project. They won't even help sail 
the boat -- that's John Bertrand's job -- let alone clean the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
What they Beach Boys are contributing is their good name and space for sponsors 
on a concert tour, most of it scheduled for next year. The campaign will get a 
boost from a sold-out concert Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Syndicate Chairman David Lowry said the 1991 tour will do a minimum of 125 
dates in 75 cities, including 50 "major markets." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Abilene, Kan.," Lowry said. "When you see what the Beach Boys are 
throwing in, it's staggering." 
</P>
<P>
For sponsorship packages of $1 1/2 million, $3 million or $5 million, Lowry 
said, "A corporate sponsor, in addition to everything they get on the boats, 
gets signing on all handouts of the concerts, signing above the stage, 
corporate display booths at the concerts, large amounts of tickets to the 
concerts, backstage passes for the VIPs, photo sessions with the band, hats . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"A year before the America's Cup even takes place, our corporate sponsors are 
being blasted all over America. The bang you get for a buck with us doesn't 
compare to any other syndicate worldwide . . . actually for less money than 
what Dennis is offering." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was born on all the impulse of a horn honking at the curb and a shout, 
"Surf's up!" 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand and boat designers Doug Peterson, John Reichel and Jim Pugh were 
sitting around itching to jump into the America's Cup game. They had the 
credentials. All they needed was the $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson knew Lowry, who is a member of the San Diego Yacht Club and a neighbor 
of Elliott Lott, who is the president of the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known him many years," Lowry said. "Doug Peterson called me and was 
frustrated that he and Jim Pugh and John Reichel and John Bertrand had all this 
talent and weren't tied into any syndicate, and said: 'Why don't you put a 
syndicate together?' 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed at him. I said, 'I'm not that foolish' -- plus you need a special 
hook. With the money that's necessary, trying to do a Dennis Conner-lookalike 
campaign isn't going to work. 
</P>
<P>
That was early June. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed that night and I saw on the side of the boat the Beach Boys 
with palm trees," Lowry said. "I called Elliott about 11 at night and said, 
'I've got this crazy idea.' He called me back the next day and said, 'I like 
it, let's talk about it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Within a week, we put the concept together, and the next day we went to meet 
with the (America's Cup) Organizing Committee. They looked at us and thought we 
were crazy, but the more they thought about it, the more they liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'We'll come back in 30 days and tell you if we're a go or not.' We 
came back in 30 days. That was the day we announced, and the next day they 
accepted us as a (potential) defender." 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand said: "We really didn't want to announce at that time and be lumped in 
with those groups that weren't that serious. But we were forced to show our 
hand, and that was probably good. What we've accomplished in three months is 
quite amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand has been there. In 1984, the Newport Beach resident earned an Olympic 
silver medal in the Finn class, and last year, he sailed Longobarda to the 
world maxi championship. He also was tactician aboard Courageous in the 1983 
America's Cup campaign and on America II off Fremantle, Australia, in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
He learned two lessons from working with skipper John Kolius in the latter 
campaign -- pace and dealing with pressure. 
</P>
<P>
America II, which represented the New York Yacht Club, was the best funded of 
six American challengers; it pursued an energetic, three-boat development 
program, and it enjoyed early apparent success, but ran out of steam and failed 
to qualify for the challenger semifinals. While Conner's Sail America team 
continued to refine its boat, America II went, almost literally, dead in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The Beach Boys' team doesn't even plan to compete in next May's world 
championship for the new America's Cup class boats, but will build up slowly to 
a big finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be in the worlds," Lowry said. "I want to be watching other 
people's (boats). I don't want them looking at mine. We don't have any 
intention of having a boat in the water until the end of July next year. We do 
not need to build a boat for marketing purposes. Dennis (Conner) felt that he 
needed to build a boat. It was important for fund-raising." 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand said: "The America's Cup is a race of technology, and toward the end 
of the trials, the development accelerates." 
</P>
<P>
Even before going to Australia, Kolius, given too heavy a load, all but 
collapsed under the pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"What I learned from that campaign was there are going to be pressures you have 
to deal with," Bertrand said. "By surrounding yourself with the right 
individuals and giving them a lot of responsibility, you don't have the risk of 
one individual falling apart. Then the whole program is weakened. 
</P>
<P>
"With John, there is no better teacher out there. I had the opportunity to 
learn from the best. He may ask Kolius to join him on the Beach Boys' boat. 
</P>
<P>
Reichel and Pugh also designed Abracadabra, which leads the International 
50-foot circuit, and Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer, perhaps the best all-round boat 
among the West Coast ultralight 70s. Nobody knows what they'll come up with for 
'92. 
</P>
<P>
We'll have fun, fun, fun till our daddy takes the T-bill away . . .

MONTCLAIR PREP STAR DEREK SPARKS LEAVES SCHOOL, RETURNING TO TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Derek Sparks, considered one of the Southland's top high school 
football players, left Montclair Prep High School in Van Nuys Wednesday and 
will return to his native Texas, according to Jerome Sparks, his uncle and 
legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
The departure ended a stormy relationship between the CIF Southern Section 
private school and Jerome Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
The move was triggered last week when George Giannini, Montclair Prep football 
coach, told Leland Sparks, Derek's cousin and teammate, that the Southern 
Section denied his request for a fifth year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Leland Sparks and two other players who were denied an extra year of 
eligibility each repeated a year for academic reasons while attending Montclair 
Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Leland Sparks also will return to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Neither player attended school this week, and Derek did not practice with the 
team, which lost its opener to Farrington of Hawaii, 28-7, last Thursday night 
in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Derek, 6 feet 1 and 208 pounds, transferred from Wharton High in southeast 
Texas to Wilmington Banning in 1988 and was named sophomore state player of the 
year by Cal-Hi Sports. He enrolled at Montclair Prep for the spring semester in 
1989 and was named The Times' Valley back of the year after he rushed for 1,944 
yards for the Mounties last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to see them go and sorry to see the boys go through this," Giannini 
said, "but I told Jerome that if this is causing that many family problems, 
they should go to another school." JOHN LYNCH

SLAIN MOTHER, CHILDREN IDENTIFIED; POLICE HAVE NO SUSPECT IN SLAYINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
Police investigating the killing of a Vietnamese family of four identified 
three of the victims, a woman and her two children, but said today they had no 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting this as if it is a murder investigation, but we have not 
ruled out anything at this time, whether it is murder or murder-suicide," Costa 
Mesa Police Capt. Tom Lazar said this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Hanh Thi Duong, 25, her son, Thang Quoc Nguyen, 7, and her daughter, Lan Ngoc 
Nguyen, 4, died of gunshot wounds, authorities said. The fourth gunshot victim, 
also Vietnamese, was a 30-year-old man, but police were withholding his name 
until next of kin could be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the couple and the two children had been living in the 
two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment for about a year, but were in the process 
of moving out. They said the woman was friendly, but spoke little English and 
mostly kept to herself. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to be pretty shaken up here," said Bob Crogan, a senior police 
officer with the Costa Mesa police department. "I can't remember the last time 
we had a multiple murder." 
</P>
<P>
Crogan said Officer Jess Gilman arrived at the apartment complex, which sits on 
Baker Street at the edge of a residential neighborhood, at 7:34 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An adult Vietnamese man had come to the apartment to help the occupants move, 
Crogan said. He called police after noticing that a back window was broken and 
seeing a pair of legs on the floor inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Gilman looked through the window and could observe two legs on the 
floor," 
</P>
<P>
Crogran said. Upon entering, the officer found two adults in the living room 
and the children in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said 7-year-old Thang had attended kindergarten at the nearby 
Killeybrook Elementary School and would have entered the first grade this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was such a sweet little boy, very cooperative, a nice little student," said 
the boy's teacher, who declined to give her name. The teacher said the boy's 
mother walked to school almost every day to pick him up, but her English was 
very limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't know anything about their home life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Tilley, who lived in the apartment facing Duong, said she had assumed 
that the couple were married and said she believed Duong was expecting a third 
child. Tilley also described Duong as a quiet woman whose only social contact 
seemed to be with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Other neighbors said they had heard pounding sounds Wednesday evening about an 
hour before police were called to the scene about 7:30 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard pounding on the wall, they kept pounding," said Miguel Henriquez, who 
lived next door. Henriquez said he went outside but saw nothing amiss in the 
apartment, except that the sliding glass door was open. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not comment on the relationship between the victims except to say 
that the man was not related to the woman and children.

TIMOTHY LEARY DAUGHTER HANGS SELF IN CELL, DIES IN HOSPITAL

<P>
The daughter of LSD guru Timothy Leary, sentenced to a mental hospital for the 
criminally insane for trying to kill her boyfriend, has died after hanging 
herself with a shoelace in a county jail cell, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Martino, 42, also known as Susan Leary, was found Monday morning hanging 
by the shoelace, tied to her cell bars at Sybil Brand Institute for Women in 
East Los Angeles, Sheriff's Deputy Mary Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
She died at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Santa Marta Hospital, Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how long Martino had been hanging in her single 
cell, but Landreth said she was in a special block where deputies check the 
welfare of each inmate every 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Martino was arrested by Glendale police on Jan. 5, 1989, for the attempted 
murder of her live-in boyfriend. During a hearing last month, a judge once 
again found her mentally incompetent and sentenced her to Patton State Hospital 
in San Bernardino County.

Senior Muslim sources said today that three British hostages held in Lebanon, 
including Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, will be freed this month. 
</P>
<P>
"If all goes well, John McCarthy, Jack Mann and Terry Waite will be released in 
September," a senior Muslim official told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The report was confirmed by a senior pro-Iranian source in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"High-level contacts between the British and the Iranian governments have 
reached their final stages and the release of the hostages would be the fruit 
of these talks," the Muslim official said.

EX-SAN DIEGO MAYOR WINS RETRIAL ON PERJURY CHARGES

<P>
Former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, forced from office after being 
convicted of hiding campaign contributions, won a new trial today from the 
state Supreme Court on his 12 perjury convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The court also set aside Hedgecock's remaining conviction, for conspiracy to 
violate campaign disclosure laws, to let a San Diego judge consider allegations 
that a bailiff improperly influenced jurors by talking about the case and 
providing them with liquor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Hedgecock was convicted of failing to disclose more than $350,000 in 
contributions to his successful 1983 campaign for mayor. The money allegedly 
came from principals in J. David &amp; Co., an investment firm that later 
collapsed. Prosecutors said some of the contributions violated local election 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's one-year jail sentence and $1,000 fine have been stayed during his 
appeal. He now works as a San Diego radio talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock, 44, said today that he is confident the ruling "is going to be the 
beginning of setting the record straight on this pretty unfortunate episode in 
my life and the life of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor had contended that he was guilty of no more than bad 
bookkeeping and claimed that he was the target of a vendetta by Dist. Atty. 
Edwin Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock said a retrial would be "a horrifying waste of resources (and) time." 
Miller's office had no immediate comment on the ruling or on whether a retrial 
would be sought; a news conference was scheduled for later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The court voted, 4 to 3, to overturn the perjury convictions on the ground that 
then-Superior Court Judge William Todd told the jury that the alleged 
deliberate errors and omissions in Hedgecock's campaign finance reports were 
"material," or substantial enough to support perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the inaccuracies were material was a factual question to be decided by 
the jury, the Supreme Court opinion by Justice Joyce Kennard said.

COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REVERSES POLICY ON DRUG EXTRADITIONS

<P>
In a major turnaround in Colombia's anti-drug strategy, President Cesar Gaviria 
has announced that cocaine traffickers who surrender will not be extradited to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new president said his decree Wednesday is part of a plan to end 
drug-related terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
A year-old war between the government and traffickers fighting extradition has 
left hundreds of people dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have been in crime and who have repented, and who voluntarily turn 
themselves in to judges in order to freely confess their crimes, may be tried 
by our judges based on our judicial order," Gaviria said in a nationally 
televised speech Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Medellin cocaine cartel declared a unilateral cease-fire in its 
terrorist attacks, apparently hoping that the new Administration would end 
extraditions. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, who was inaugurated Aug. 7, said in his speech that criminals who turn 
themselves in will also face lighter sentences.

U.S. TROOPS IN GULF UPSET, WORRIED BY POSSIBLE LOSS OF PAY

DRAGON BASE CAMP, Saudi Arabia

<TEXT>
<P>
The talk from the exhausted group huddled under the F-15 turned quickly from 
the intricacies of jet engines to worries about financial support for their 
wives and children back home. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government may cut the supplemental income soldiers received back home 
for living off-base because they now get their food and supplies free in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a kid four weeks ago and that money is figured into my finances," 
Chris Jessen told a visitor to an F-15 maintenance hangar Wednesday, where the 
airmen work 12-hour shifts in sweltering heat. 
</P>
<P>
"If they take it away, then in essence the government is saying, 'Sergeant, 
you're going to pay us this money so that you can go to Saudi Arabia and 
support the mission,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jessen's buddies huddled under the F-15 nodded their heads in agreement; all 
but one of the five is married, the other four all have children. One found out 
the other day that his wife is pregnant with their fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as morale, that's the biggest problem," Kevin Wilde, of Sioux City, 
Iowa, said of the possible loss of the pay known as BAS -- Basic Allowance for 
Subsistence. For these men, it amounts to an extra $180 a month -- about 20% of 
their total pay. 
</P>
<P>
Their commanding officer interjected, saying that for now the Air Force's 
Tactical Air Command has kept up the payments but that Congress will have to 
act to keep the money flowing if the BAS payments are to continue throughout 
the U.S. deployment. 
</P>
<P>
The airmen complained a bit about the heat, and the long hours spent hunched 
under the seemingly endless line of F-15s needing maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Airman Adam Bayes described the days this way: "You go to work for 12 hours, go 
home, get clean, go to bed, wake up, get clean, whatever, do your laundry if 
you can do that, come to work, work, go home, sleep. It's getting to be a 
routine." 
</P>
<P>
So much so that Wilde spent his day off this week sitting around watching his 
buddies work. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what else to do," he said.

North and South Korea ended two rounds of talks between their prime ministers 
today, agreeing to disagree on most major issues but taking steps to resolve 
the question of U.N. membership and reuniting split families.

<P>
Officials from both Koreas basked in new-found cordiality and optimism as the 
highest-level inter-Korean talks ended in Seoul, the capital once virtually 
leveled by North Korean tanks and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not reach any eye-opening agreements, but the fact we realized the 
talks themselves is an important achievement," Seoul's Unification Minister 
Hong Sung Chul told reporters.

Hong said both sides agreed to hold further talks on U.N. membership and 
efforts to reunite families split by the 1950-53 Korean War.

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said today that he and a group of 
corporate chief executive officers will tour the Soviet Union next week to 
discuss bolstering that country's lagging oil production and improving trade. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount to be done," Mosbacher said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the biggest oil producer in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of new methodologies and a lot of new equipment that's been 
developed in this country over the last decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet oil production has been paralyzed by aging equipment and a choking 
bureaucracy. But the United States believes that it can tap a new source of 
energy if it provides the Soviets with a mix of management advice, hardware and 
pointers on drilling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"They're producing all they can now," Mosbacher said. "There's a good chance 
some of the (U.S.) group might be going to the oil fields." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen influential business executives are to make the trip, which starts 
Saturday and includes a visit to Helsinki, Finland, to meet President Bush 
after his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 are Lodwrick Cook, chairman of Atlantic Richfield Co.; James 
Kinnear, president of Texaco Inc., and Chesley Pruet, president of Pruet Oil 
Co. of El Dorado, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said the trip was being planned before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait, the seizure of the sheikdom's oil fields and the dramatic increase in 
world petroleum prices. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that promises of technical and economic aid to the Soviets are 
not a "quid pro quo" for their cooperation in the U.N.-sanctioned blockade of 
Iraq.

MAJOR RETAILERS REPORT SLUGGISH SALES IN AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The country's major retailers today reported ho-hum August sales, reflecting 
consumer caution in the face of a shaky economy and worries about war in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Several national chains did adequate business during the start of the 
traditional back-to-school season, but overall the retail industry rang up 
disappointing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"While there was variation among the companies, we would portray the results as 
sluggish," analyst Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the negative impact that the Persian Gulf conflict has had on consumer 
confidence and the current economic weakness, retailers are concerned about how 
business will be in the important Christmas season, when they typically make 
50% to 60% of their annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are already cutting back on merchandise commitments as well as 
reducing expenses in order to protect profitability," Feiner said.

U.S. BUSINESSES PLAN 5.1% RISE IN INVESTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE INCREASE IN SPENDING ON PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT IS SEEN BY SOME AS 
ANOTHER SIGN OF SLUGGISHNESS.

<P>
American businesses plan to boost spending on plants and equipment 5.1% this 
year, the lowest increase in three years, the government said today in a report 
reflecting economic sluggishness even before the Persian Gulf crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said a survey conducted in July and August found 
businesses planned to spend $526.9 billion for expansion and modernization this 
year, the fourth consecutive year of increased business investment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey was still under way at the time of the Aug. 2 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait, some analysts said the spending plans were little affected 
by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely that the Kuwait situation would have much impact, given that 
most of this spending is already set in motion," economists at Mitsubishi Bank 
in New York wrote in their current newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
If realized, the investment spending would top the record $501.6 billion in 
capital expenditures set last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the 5.1% rate of increase was the lowest since a 3.1% gain in 1987 and less 
than half the 10.4% advance last year. Capital spending rose 9.5% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate also is down from the 5.5% spending increase that businesses 
said they planned in the previous survey, completed in May. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have been looking for continued business investment to help 
stimulate an economy that has been slowing for more than a year as the Federal 
Reserve kept a tight rein on credit to curb inflation.

Stock prices took a tumble today, hammered down by revived upward pressure on 
world oil prices that some investors feared could tip the economy into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 31.93 points to close at 2,596.29. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 507 up, 951 down and 489 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 125.62 million shares, against 120.61 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index dropped 1.87 to 176.06. 
</P>
<P>
The price of oil climbed above $31 a barrel as pessimism spread about chances 
for any early resolution of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts said buyers were holding back awaiting the Labor 
Department's report Friday morning on the employment situation for August. The 
figures are expected to show continued weakness in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation has begun to spread on Wall Street that the data might encourage 
the Federal Reserve to adopt a more stimulative credit policy in an effort to 
ease strains on the economy and the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Streeters are not entirely convinced that long-term interest rates 
would automatically fall in response to such a move. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some say, rates could rise in that setting if fears increased that the 
Fed was softening its stand against inflation. That, in turn, would stand to 
leave the central bank in an even worse policy bind than it has to contend with 
now. 
</P>
<P>
With an hour of trading to go, losers among the blue chips included Boeing, 
down 1 1/2 at 47 1/4; General Electric, down 3/8 at 59 7/8; American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, down 5/8 at 31 1/2, and Pepsico, down 3/4 at 24 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing issues were broadly lower as the industry posted sluggish sales 
results for August. The Limited fell 1 3/8 to 15 3/8; Wal-Mart Stores 1 to 27 
3/8; Toys R Us 3/8 to 24 1/8, and K mart 1/2 to 27.

Fed by a strong appetite for luxury cars, sales of imported vehicles in Japan

Miami of Ohio announced today that it has appointed Joby Wright, a 10-year 
assistant coach under Bob Knight at Indiana, to be Miami's new basketball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who turned 40 on Wednesday, replaces Jerry Peirson, who was fired Aug. 
3 after he admitted that he gave a player a false grade. 
</P>
<P>
Wright played for Indiana and was chosen captain of the Hoosiers and all-Big 
Ten in 1972. He holds two degrees from Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
As an assistant coach, he was part of NCAA championship teams in 1981 and 1987, 
nine NCAA tournament appearances and four Big Ten titles. 
</P>
<P>
Miami athletic director R. C. Johnson said Wright, who was chosen from a field 
of more than 50 candidates, received strong support from Knight and from 
Indiana football coach Bill Mallory, a former Miami football coach.

Marshall Bridges, a relief pitcher for four major leagues teams, has died of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges died Monday at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
He had 23 victories, 15 losses, 25 saves and a 3.75 earned run average during 
seven major league seasons beginning in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, who was known as "Sheriff," broke into the majors with the St. Louis 
Cardinals and pitched for the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and Washington 
Senators before returning to the minor leagues after the 1965 season. His best 
season was 1962, when Bridges went 8-4 with 15 saves for the world champion 
Yankees, for whom he made his only World Series appearance.

The NFL will take a look at the Eric Dickerson-Indianapolis Colts feud. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who was placed on the Colts' non-football injury list and suspended 
by the team, is scheduled to meet with NFL counsel Jay Moyer on Sept. 17 in New 
York. League spokesman Greg Aiello said a Colts' representative could also be 
present at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who recently refused to have his injured left hamstring examined by 
a Colts' physician, claims that he is healthy and never should have been placed 
on the non-football injury list. Because of the Colts' moves, Dickerson 
virtually forfeits more than $450,000 in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson missed the entire preseason.

John Grimsley, the unsigned Houston Oilers' linebacker, has filed suit in 
federal court, charging the 28 NFL teams with denying players the right to sell 
their services on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do is play football, and they're keeping me from doing that," 
said Grimsley, who led the Oilers in tackles last year. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want is a chance to pursue a chance to play football." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon denied Grimsley a temporary injunction on 
Wednesday that would have allowed him to become an unrestricted free agent. A 
hearing on the case was set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Grimsley was paid $350,000 last season and reportedly has been offered $500,000 
for this season. He wants $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL and the NFL Players Assn. have been without a collective-bargaining 
agreement since 1987. One of the major stumbling blocks centers on unrestricted 
free agency.

The Minnesota North Stars today sent goaltender Daniel Berthiaume to Los 
Angeles in exchange for left wing Craig Duncanson. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was one of three trades the Minnesota club announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Duncanson was then sent to Winnipeg in exchange for center Brian Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
And left wing Dave MacKey was sent to Vancouver for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Berthiaume was acquired from Winnipeg earlier this year. He played in five 
games, posting a 1-3-0 record wiht a 3.50 GAA. 
</P>
<P>
Duncanson spent mot of least season with New Haven, a minor league club, 
playing only 10 games with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, Winnipeg's fourth choice, 73rd overall, in the 1988 entry draft, played 
with Moncton last season, collecting 4 goals, 11 assists for 15 points and 19 
penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, 21, played the previous three years for Oshawa of the Ontario Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Clarke, Minnesota general manager, said Hunt is expected to report to the 
North Stars' training camp at Kalamazoo, Mich., next Wednesday.

draft. He played 16 games, scoring 2 goals and collecting 28 penalty minutes.

IMPROMPTU DUO OF SMYLIE, WOODBRIDGE WINS CROWN

Liz Smylie and Todd Woodbridge of Australia completed a straight sets march 
through the U.S. Open mixed doubles competition today, clinching the 
championship with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Jim Pugh of the United States and 
Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an impromptu team. 
</P>
<P>
Smylie had been scheduled to play with regular partner John Fitzgerald but he 
pulled out of the tournament when his wife gave birth a week before the Open. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, as a last minute replacement, and Smylie became just the second 
team in the Open era to win the title without dropping a set. The only others 
to do that were Margaret Court and Marty Riessen in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second mixed doubles crown for Smylie, who also won the event in 
1983. "As you get older, it gets relative," she said. "It's different than the 
one I won in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"You realize Grand Slam tournaments are very important. You realize what's 
attached to them." 
</P>
<P>
For Woodbridge, it was the first Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge said he played most of his shots to Zvereva while Smylie was the 
target of most of Pugh's shots. "You know when you play mixed, the men play to 
the women," Smylie said. "You know you'll get more play than your partner." 
</P>
<P>
The winners offered different views of their victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We were awesome," Smylie said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky," Woodbridge said.

PIMLICO FACES COIN TOSS FOR SUNDAY CARDS

<P>
For the first time in the five years of Maryland Million racing, the lineup of 
some races Sunday at Pimlico Race Course may have to be decided by lot. 
</P>
<P>
The races limited to horses sired by Maryland stallions are attracting more 
business than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, oversubscribed races are divided. Because of tradition, certain 
races, such as Triple Crown events, are not permitted to be divided. Dividing 
Million Day races would be awkward and could reduce the purses. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 races scheduled Sunday, with purses totaling more than $1 million, 
four were oversubscribed after the pre-entry deadline of Aug. 23, when $500 had 
to be paid for each pre-entry. Another $500 is required for each horse to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two 2-year-old fillies are still eligible for the $100,000 Maryland 
Lassie, and 16 male 2-year-olds were pre-entered for the $100,000 Crown Central 
Nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen were pre-entered for the $100,000 Maryland Turf race for 3-year-olds, 
and 22 were pre-entered for the $50,000 Mercedes-Benz Handicap, a race for 
horses that have competed in claiming events. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12 can start in the Lassie, Nursery and Turf. The maximum for the 
Mercedes-Benz is 14. Maximums are determined by the width of the track at the 
starting points. 
</P>
<P>
If horses are excluded at entry-time Friday, their owners will be returned 
their pre-entry fees.

EASTWOOD PULLING AWAY FROM ROLES THAT MADE HIS CAREER

<P>
In a movie career spanning 35 years, Clint Eastwood has played a host of 
tough-guy characters ranging from gunfighter to cop, from mountain climber to 
jet pilot. 
</P>
<P>
But the craggy-faced actor and director has branched out in recent years toward 
more artistic projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to reach out and do a lot of things. I think that keeps you healthy, 
keeps you analyzing films," said Eastwood, whose nearly 20-year directing 
career is the subject of a three-week retrospective at the Walker Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better for me. If I'd just done genre films -- detectives and Westerns -- 
when I started back in '64, I could be pretty self-bored by now. I'd probably 
be retired by now." 
</P>
<P>
His latest film, "White Hunter, Black Heart," explores the obsession of a movie 
director bent on bagging an elephant in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The need for change may be why Eastwood said Wednesday that he plans no more 
sequels to his popular "Dirty Harry" movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where you'd take him," said Eastwood, who has starred in five 
"Dirty Harry" pictures, starting in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dead Pool," his last film about the San Francisco police detective who 
taunted bad guys to "make my day," was released in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The very dangerous thing about doing sequels is you can fall into a pattern of 
self-imitation. You'd have to have an awfully good script to take you away from 
that," he said.

BABY HELPS TANYA TUCKER WIPE OUT HER IMAGE AS A PARTY GIRL

In country music circles, Tanya Tucker has a reputation as a hell-raiser, but 
the brand is fading. 
</P>
<P>
Country music's original party girl became a mother last year, and she makes it 
clear to anyone who will listen that daughter Presley Tanita is No. 1 in her 
life these days. 
</P>
<P>
The two are never far apart. A crib was even built into Tucker's touring bus so 
the two could be together during a coast-to-coast promotional tour of the 
singer's latest album, "Tennessee Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Motherhood apparently has proved inspirational for the 31-year-old Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking Shoes," a cut from the new album, topped the country charts recently, 
and she's up for two Country Music Assn. Awards for top female vocalist as well 
as vocal event of the year for a duet performance of "Don't Go Out" with T. 
Graham Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really a joy. She loves people," Tucker said of her first child. "I 
think she's musical. I can tell by the way she reacts to music." 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, Tucker isn't entirely sure she would encourage her daughter 
to pursue a music career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's complicated and difficult. It's an extreme lifestyle," said Tucker, who 
has spent only two of the last 48 days at her Tennessee home. "I'm pretty 
jaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only that, but all eyes are upon you all the time. I prefer her to have 
more of a private life, to not be affected by what people think," Tucker said.

DIONE NEUTRA; INFLUENTIAL AIDE IN HUSBAND'S WORK AS ARCHITECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Dione Neutra, concert singer and cellist and key aide to her late husband, 
architect Richard Neutra, has died. She was 89. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Neutra died Saturday. The cause of death was not disclosed, but she had 
been confined to a wheelchair and to her home for the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
She lived in Silver Lake in the Research House, which her husband designed in 
1933. Rebuilt after a fire in 1963 by her husband and architect son, Dion, the 
house was donated to Cal Poly Pomona in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm very lucky to live in a beautiful house, so I don't mind sharing 
it," she said before the three-story stack of glass, stucco and balconies was 
opened to a Los Angeles Conservancy tour a few years ago. She had retained a 
life estate, but the architectural gem will now revert completely to the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Neutra, an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects and 
considered the matriarch of the Southern California architectural community, 
had given vocal concerts in the historic house, accompanying herself on the 
cello. 
</P>
<P>
"My purpose of life was to help my husband for 48 years to accomplish as much 
as possible of what he felt was his mission in life, namely, to provide a more 
healthful, pleasing, natural environment for his clients," she frequently said 
in lectures and interviews after his death in 1970. "Now . . . I ask myself 
'What is my purpose in life?' It seems to me to show my younger friends that 
life in old age can be worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
When she was widowed, Mrs. Neutra resumed the study of voice and cello that she 
had set aside when she became Neutra's wife and secretary. 
</P>
<P>
She celebrated her 85th birthday in 1986 by publishing a book of the couple's 
letters from 1919 to 1932, titled, "Richard Neutra: Promise and Fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was honored at that time with a dinner given by five Southern 
California schools of architecture, she remained modest about her own 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always the wife of the famous architect," she said. "Mr. Neutra was the 
one who inspired people. Now people tell me I've become the inspiration, and 
I'm surprised by that." 
</P>
<P>
The book details the struggles of a young European couple emigrating to 
California, and their anguish over the discovery that Frank, eldest of their 
three sons, was born brain-damaged. Dion, the second son, followed his father 
into architecture, and the youngest, Raymond, became an epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Her survivors also include two sisters, Regula Fybel and Verene Bezencon, four 
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be planned at a later date.

WILLIAM SILENT HUGHES, 84; INVESTMENT BANKING EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Silent Hughes, former president of the independent investment banking 
firm Wagenseller &amp; Durst Inc., has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes died Sunday at his San Marino home of degenerative heart disease and 
complications of old age. 
</P>
<P>
He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1966 to 1969 and a 
governor of the Pacific Stock Exchange from 1978 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also was a governor of the National Assn. of Security Dealers, a 
governor of the Investment Bankers Assn. and an adviser to the New York Stock 
Exchange on regional firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Wagenseller &amp; Durst firm, which Hughes headed from 1948 until 1979, 
changed ownership in 1979, with Hughes becoming vice chairman and a director. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never been interested in selling our company to a large national 
organization," Hughes said at the time, "so this combination of new ownership 
and younger management will permit Wagenseller &amp; Durst to remain 
independently active in this field." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a Los Angeles-area resident since infancy, was graduated from Los 
Angeles Polytechnic High School and UCLA. He was a founding trustee of the UCLA 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Marion; two daughters, Dorothy Matthiessen and 
Adele Berwanger, and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday in the Freeman Chapel of 
the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The family has requested that memorial donations be made to the UCLA 
Foundation.

BABYLON, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, 
</P>
<P>
 I am the son of Nabuplossar, King of Babylon. 
</P>
<P>
 I who erected the Ezida Temple, 
</P>
<P>
 I who built Procession Street, 
</P>
<P>
 The Street of the Forgiven Son, 
</P>
<P>
 The Street of Nebu, 
</P>
<P>
 And paved it with shimmering stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebu, you the divine minister, 
</P>
<P>
 Grant me immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inscription at Babylon 
</P>
<P>
The tour guide at a reconstructed palace in Babylon described with enthusiasm 
the restored monuments of the ancient city -- the lion sculpture, the brick 
reliefs of bulls and griffins, the newly planted hanging gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Then she got to the throne room and, with a sweep of her hand, pointed to the 
empty platform. "This is where the leader Saddam Hussein had his throne. This 
is where Saddam Hussein sat," she said, voice rising in pride. 
</P>
<P>
The short, stout woman looked around at the quizzical faces, then caught 
herself with a nervous laugh. "I mean Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar. 
Nebuchadnezzar had his throne here." 
</P>
<P>
The guide could be forgiven for the gaffe, for even here at this 4,000-year-old 
site on the banks of the slow-moving Euphrates, the handwriting on the wall 
says that Saddam Hussein is Iraq's ruler for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, Iraq's president and self-described leader of the Arab world, has 
created for himself a regional personality cult unrivaled in the world of the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon creates a landscape in itself. Giant portraits decorate plazas, 
traffic circles and government and private buildings throughout the country. 
His mustachioed face greets you at the airport in black-and-white photos, at 
the currency exchange desk on color calendars, on roadside signs on 
superhighways into Baghdad, at hotel entrances, in government offices. (In the 
Information Ministry, one office has four portraits placed so that no matter 
which way you turn, he is there.) Television offers no escape: The nightly news 
relentlessly begins with reports of the president's daily activity. 
Neighborhoods are named after him. Sports arenas. Schools. Bridges. A slice of 
newly annexed Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
To view these images is to gaze at a conception of power and, in no small way, 
to get a glimpse of the national obsessions of one of the Middle East's most 
fractious societies. 
</P>
<P>
The fatherly image that dominates the personality cult clashes with the violent 
means that Hussein used to achieve and keep power. The assassinations, 
executions, jailings and persecution of political opponents have made it all 
but impossible for anyone to challenge Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
As for the image, wrote Middle East expert Frederick W. Axelrod in his book 
"The New Iraq," "Clumsy and rigid as they are, such attempts to inundate Iraq's 
political culture with the image of its energetic leader have, by their sheer 
weight, imposed on the public mind the suggestion that there is no true 
alternative to Saddam Hussein's leadership in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
In his countless public portraits, Hussein is presented as a man of the people 
-- of all the people in this ethnically and religiously split land. Sometimes 
he is shown as fatherly, with a child bouncing on his knee, sometimes wearing a 
Western suit for the benefit of businessmen and bureaucrats. Sometimes he is 
the desert chieftain in flowing robes, the hunter with Tyrolean hat and 
shotgun, the dandy in Panama hat and open shirt, the farmer in shirtsleeves 
trading chitchat with craggy-faced peasants, the statesman sitting in the gilt 
presidential chair. 
</P>
<P>
He is up to date, depicted standing in front of a futuristic landscape of 
skyscrapers or in a series of pop art portraits a la Andy Warhol. He is 
eternal, as in Babylon, where a billboard has him sharing a scene with 
Nebuchadnezzar near the tower of Babel. 
</P>
<P>
For Iraq's Shiite Muslim population, whose loyalty to a state dominated by a 
Sunni Muslim minority was long suspect, Hussein is revealed on posters at 
prayer, on a rug, palms up in a gesture of supplication, eyes looking to 
heaven. The image is striking given the secular nature of the quasi-socialist 
Arab Baath Socialist Party that Hussein leads. 
</P>
<P>
As a sop to Iraq's restive Kurdish population, Hussein poses in a blue robe and 
turban typical of Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
The personality cult flowered during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran, a 
conflict that began in 1980 and took hundreds of thousands of lives on each 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The war, initially a conflict over the waterway formed by the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers, became thoroughly identified with Hussein. Iraqis came to 
refer to the conflict as a new version of the ancient war between Mesopotamia, 
the historical forerunner of Iraq, and Persia, which was to become Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Military portraits are the most common homage to Hussein. He's a paratrooper in 
beret, an infantryman in helmet, a much-decorated officer holding a ceremonial 
saber. 
</P>
<P>
One painting shows him standing in front of a battlefield replete with chariots 
and bowmen. 
</P>
<P>
Such heavy-handed efforts to link Hussein's dictatorship with Iraq's past is 
one of the most striking themes of his self-aggrandizement. He tries to line up 
not only with the most ancient of rulers, but also with more recent ones who 
until just a year ago were viewed as corrupt pawns of foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he rehabilitated Faisal I, who led the Arab Revolt against Turkish 
rule in World War I. Faisal had been promised rule over Syria by his British 
allies but was betrayed and given Iraq as a consolation prize. Last year, 
Hussein renovated Faisal's tomb, along with those of other members of the royal 
Hashemite family, and he restored an equestrian statue of Faisal to a Baghdad 
square. 
</P>
<P>
The Hashemites were overthrown in a bloody coup in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has not stopped at just reviving the Hashemites' dignity; he has 
decided to join them, in a way. Conveniently, a family tree has been discovered 
in the southern town of Kerbala that purports to show that Hussein, just like 
the deposed monarchy, is related to the Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Jordan's King Hussein, a Hashemite but no kin to Saddam Hussein, has 
started calling the Iraqi leader "cousin." 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein makes much of his tenuous contact with another Arab hero -- 
Saladin, the Medieval nemesis of the Crusaders. Both came from the same 
village, Tikrit, north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
No ruler in ancient Mesopotamia is beyond association with Hussein. In the 
basement of the Martyr's Monument, a massive Baghdad shrine to the Persian Gulf 
War dead in the form of a split Oriental dome, a new exhibit traces Hussein's 
life in photos. There's the wattle hut where he was born, photos of him as a 
jug-eared schoolboy who got high marks in school in singing and history, of a 
gangly teen with only a hint of the mustache that would flourish later in life, 
of an underground revolutionary who tried to kill a prime minister and fled 
into exile, of a hunted nationalist exile in a variety of disguises, of a 
smiling leader with wife and baby. 
</P>
<P>
Punctuating this epic biography is a photo of what appears to be a relief of 
the type that originated at Babylon. On the right is a gowned figure of 
Hammurabi, who ruled 4,000 years ago and earned eternal fame for devising the 
world's first code of law. He is handing a copy to -- who else? -- Saddam 
Hussein, who is wearing a suit and tie for the occasion.

LAWYER GETS THE CALL TO TAKE CAMP PENDLETON COMMAND 
</P>

San Diego lawyer Michael I. Neil, a brigadier general in the Marine Corps 
Reserves and a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, has been called to active 
duty, and on Friday will take command of Camp Pendleton, the Marines said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neil, 50, will take over for Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, who became Camp 
Pendleton's new commander a month ago but was almost immediately sent to 
command the Marine force in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent San Diego attorney who served as an infantry platoon commander in 
Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross and the Purple Heart, said 
Wednesday that he has been at Camp Pendleton "on a regular basis" over the past 
year to learn how to run the base. 
</P>
<P>
Neil said he was notified Tuesday night that he was being called up and would 
command Camp Pendleton for an indefinite period. "It depends on what occurs on 
the world scene," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the base has experienced its biggest mobilization since the Vietnam War, 
Neil also said there "are still a lot of Marines on board" to oversee at the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
The camp normally has a complement of 36,000 Marines as well as several 
thousand dependents and civilian employees. The Marine Corps refuses to say how 
many have left for the Mideast.
