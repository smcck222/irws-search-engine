PRESSURE TO DRILL FOR OIL IN WILDLIFE REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Balzar's article read like an oil-industry handout. 
</P>
<P>
He was obviously taken in by the dog-and-pony show presented by the Arctic oil 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
They somehow convinced him that enormous pressures were building up to open the 
range to oil drilling. They employed an obviously compromised Fish-and-Wildlife 
"scientist" to support their specious argument that development will not unduly 
harm the wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that Balzar didn't do his homework and review the 10-year debate 
on the development of the range, the volumes of testimony contained in 
environmental impact statements, the interests of Alaska Natives in the area or 
Canada's strong opposition to the development of the caribou-calving areas. 
</P>
<P>
The dependence of about 40 Alaskan and Canadian Native communities occupying an 
area the size of Indiana on the annual migration of the Porcupine caribou herd 
is one of the great natural wonders of the world. In the absence of any 
national energy policy governing oil use and development, the complicity of 
your paper in the industry's brazen exploitation of the Mideast crisis to 
sustain its attack on the environment is astonishing.

PRESSURE TO DRILL FOR OIL IN WILDLIFE REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest John Balzer's article ("Mideast Crisis Endangers Pristine 
Alaskan Refuge," front page, Aug. 26) on pressure to turn the oil industry 
loose in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant statistic about the refuge is this: Even if Big Oil did 
beat the 4-1 odds against finding a commercially viable field, the most likely 
output would satisfy just 2% of U.S. oil demand. 
</P>
<P>
Those are Reagan Administration numbers. 
</P>
<P>
We could save that much oil simply by increasing the efficiency of new U.S. 
cars by two miles per gallon -- and 10 times that much oil by passing a bill 
now before the Senate that would increase the fleet requirement to 40 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, oil kills. It kills wildlife where we drill and where we spill. 
It kills refinery workers in explosions. It kills as pollution poisons our 
bodies. It will kill us as greenhouse gases warm the globe. And, if our luck 
runs out in the Middle East, it will, in effect, kill U.S. soldiers and others. 
Our addiction to oil must be ended as quickly as possible, and giving the oil 
industry carte blanche in the Arctic refuge would only prolong our dependence.

REVISING SAT QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial of Aug. 26 describes the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) revision 
as a potential boon to minority students. If the SAT is biased, every attempt 
should be made to revise it to eliminate that bias. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial, however, appears to assume that lower test results translate 
directly into discrimination. There are other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Equally plausible is the possibility that lower scores accurately reflect 
achievement -- that minority youngsters are really not gaining as much from our 
educational institutions -- that they are failing to learn! When youngsters 
fail to learn, the fault may be in the schools. It may be in the homes that do 
not value and support academic efforts. It may be in the students themselves -- 
youngsters who seldom complete assignments, who fail to channel energy into 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Broadening the content of the SAT is likely to improve its ability to measure 
verbal and mathematics skills. These revisions, however, are yet unproven. 
Scoring may not only prove difficult and costly, it is likely to introduce a 
new set of biases as evaluators sort through problems in handwriting, language 
mechanics and usage. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot assume that modifying test content will be a panacea for our complex 
educational problems.

ARE YOU LISTENING, MR. PRESIDENT?; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH NEEDS TO PICK A NEW CHIEF FOR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when our nation faces its most formidable health challenges, the 
National Institutes of Health -- the premier U.S. biomedical research facility 
-- lacks a leader. The directorship, once considered among the most prestigious 
scientific jobs in the world, has been vacant for more than a year. Even more 
distressing: No prospect is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the Bush Administration can't even give the job away. It has bumbled 
the job search so badly since a Ronald Reagan appointee, Dr. James Wyngaarden, 
left in July, 1989, that most candidates now see the directorship as too 
political -- a tool of the White House. Early on, some candidates were asked 
their views on abortion, the so-called litmus test. Considering the subject had 
little to do with running the NIH, candidates understandably were upset. 
William H. Danforth, chancellor of Washington University -- whose brother, 
John, is Missouri's Republican senator -- angrily withdrew his name after such 
a query. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration now insists it has dropped the litmus test, the 
resentment lingers. The scientific community widely opposes the 
Administration's continued ban on federal funding for research using fetal 
tissue. Bush has shown little initiative in other health areas as well. The 
Food &amp; Drug Administration, for example, has no leader despite the pressing 
need to expedite its drug-approval process to make experimental drugs available 
to critically ill cancer and AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Democratic members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, 
which has jurisdiction over NIH, recently urged Bush to fill the NIH position. 
"The National Institutes of Health are too important to the health of the 
nation to permit the position of director to be trivialized by the political 
manipulations that have characterized the selection process up to this point," 
their letter said. "We urge you to end the current disarray and petty 
machinations . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Are you listening, Mr. President?

EFFECTS OF FOREIGN MANUFACTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again the Los Angeles Times ("U.S. Textile Policy Is No Bargain," 
Editorials, Aug. 6) mounts the pulpit for a ritual bashing of the U.S. textile 
industry for doing nothing more than trying to stay in business and keep 2 
million Americans employed. 
</P>
<P>
The study by William Cline that you cite is being flaunted by importing 
interests to protect their big mark-ups and heavy market penetration, which 
have little to do with keeping down consumer prices. This study is seriously 
flawed because it tells only part of the story. A careful analysis by some 
leading economists who looked at it objectively shows that Cline overstates the 
cost of textile quotas to the consumer, ignores the effect of slowed import 
growth on job creation for the economy as a whole and understates the damage 
that rapid import growth will cause for the U.S. apparel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Studies that analyze the textile imports bill pending in Congress show that its 
overall impact on the economy would be to create a $1-billion economic benefit 
and 100,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Those who benefit from imports of clothing and textiles are retailers, who 
enjoyed profits of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989, and foreign 
manufacturers and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
Imports do not mean lower prices for clothes for consumers. Just browse through 
any clothing catalogue. Look at the items that say "Imported" and those "Made 
In U.S.A." Then notice that the prices and the products are the same. 
</P>
<P>
Imports are steadily overwhelming the U.S. textile and apparel market. Since 
1980, 400,000 jobs have been lost. Textile and apparel employment in March was 
at its lowest level in a half century. The U.S. textile industry is the most 
modern and productive in the world. In spite of this, foreign manufacturers 
have advantages that we cannot overcome by continued investment. They are 
subsidized by their governments, pay slave wages, often employ children working 
long shifts, ignore safety practices, pollute the environment and protect their 
own markets from import competition. 
</P>
<P>
Imports now have 60% of the U.S. apparel market. If that trend continues, 
imports will soon overwhelm the American market. But a more chilling prospect 
has to do with national defense. If foreigners supply the U.S. military, what 
happens in the event of mobilization, such as we have right now in the Middle 
East? 
</P>
<P>
The issue of controlling textile and apparel imports has been around a long 
time. The textile bill is an idea whose time has come.

It came as a shock but not a surprise to learn in Gregory Nowell's commentary 
(Aug. 31) that oil companies are trying to block the state Air Resources Board 
plan to require that methanol be made available at 300 gasoline stations. But 
there is an even more compelling reason than cleaning up the air to break our 
addiction to gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Our dependence on foreign oil will soon increase drastically, since at the 
present rate of consumption all U.S. oil may be gone in 32 years according to 
Department of the Interior Geologic Survey. 
</P>
<P>
But Nowell's suggestion to call the Air Quality Management District hot line 
and protest the oil companies' attempt would interfere with the line's 
important function. Letters to the AQMD or the ARB urging the plan be approved 
at the Sept. 27 meeting would be more effective (as well as letters to auto 
manufacturers requesting methanol-capable engines). 
</P>
<P>
Until methanol becomes more widely available, we can each take immediate 
actions to reduce our gas consumption by 1) decreasing our maximum speed 
(especially vans and other vehicles with high wind resistance), 2) avoiding 
jack-rabbit starts and 3) looking ahead to try to coast to a stop since every 
braking is lost energy.

The article on energy alternatives mentioned that energy from biomass is not 
yet practical. 
</P>
<P>
It was on its way to becoming practical in the 1930s when Henry Ford was 
growing cannabis plants (hemp; marijuana) and powering his autos with processed 
methanol from those unique plants. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, new machinery was making the harvest and breakdown of 
these prolific biomass creators fast and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
The Times article mentioned ethanol production from corn, a plant that produces 
biomass at a fraction of the amount that hemp can provide per acre, even on 
marginal land. Hemp grown for biomass makes poor-grade smoking product. 
Numerous other sub products can be processed from the hemp plant, including 
paper and textile products, and high protein food stuffs from the hemp seed. 
</P>
<P>
It might be supposed that a large portion of Americans would be aghast at 
considering the deregulation of hemp as a commercial product. But considering 
that we already pay taxes to subsidize the cultivation of tobacco and grains 
for alcohol, items useless except for their ability to intoxicate and addict 
people, should it not be time for us to seriously consider the reintroduction 
of hemp in American agriculture and energy alternative research?

Henry Ford in the early 1900s designed the Model "T" to run on grain alcohol. 
His idea was that rural farmers could use their corn and grain to ferment and 
distill their own fuel at little or no cost to the farmer. 
</P>
<P>
However, the major oil companies talked Ford out of his original idea. 
</P>
<P>
Ford made the decision to change his carburetor to run on gasoline rather than 
alcohol. He was a genius but he was like the rest of us. He saw a way to get 
rich, rather than realizing the true value of his original idea. Had he 
followed through with his alcohol carburetor, our air would still be clean. The 
oil companies wouldn't have the power to raise prices and we wouldn't be so 
reliant on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe the Arab countries aren't any more guilty of greed than Henry Ford 
was.

So poor Bret Johnson decided to quit UCLA because he wouldn't be starting? 
Isn't that a shame. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, when Johnson was El Toro's sophomore quarterback, I was the 
starting center. One thing I'll always remember is that when the going got 
tough, Bret whined, sniveled and pointed fingers -- at everybody except 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bret never lost a game because the other guy was better. Bret always lost 
because his teammates didn't block, the referee made a poor call or there was 
bad weather. In Bret Johnson's mind, Bret Johnson could do no wrong. I think 
UCLA fans will join me in saying good riddance.

I don't know Bret Johnson. I do know quarterbacks and kids.

Sure, Johnson may have made a bum call in walking out on UCLA after he got 
demoted from the starting QB job. But what is the kid -- 19? 
</P>
<P>
This isn't Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait. Or Nixon justifying Watergate. This 
isn't even a big-bucks pro quarterback who presumably has some maturity and 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
Is this reason enough for Mike Downey to vilify the young man?

Wonder why L.A. is the quarterback controversy capital of the Western world?

<P>
Do TV sports directors ever watch sports at home? They are so out of touch with 
viewers that I feel the need to point out some obvious mistakes of TV sports 
coverage: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sports viewers never want live action displaced by replays. Never. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sports viewers don't want even a few minutes of non-sports background 
informantion -- like having to watch how Grover Cleveland established Labor Day 
before the real coverage of U.S. Open Tennis began. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sports viewers who watch boxing have no morals. They are not offended by a 
boxer getting beaten bloody and they would also not be offended if the cameras 
caught a few seconds of the girls carrying the cards around the ring between 
rounds.

Again this year, the USC publicity department has done a Hollywood job in

AL MARTINEZ: TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the nature of one who toils for a living to try by whatever means 
available to make his or her job easier. 
</P>
<P>
I, for instance, have been exploring the possibility of devising a software 
program with which I would only have to push a few keys to produce a column. 
</P>
<P>
By pre-programming a series of subjects, tones and points of view into a 
computer and garnishing them with required parts of speech, I might at least 
come up with a basic, reusable outline. I'm working on it. 
</P>
<P>
I mention this to explain why it is only natural that Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates would similarly explore ways to make his job easier. By that I mean, 
shooting casual drug users. 
</P>
<P>
It modifies an earlier Good Idea that involved the use of an armored battering 
ram to enter rock houses. The ram, alas, proved excessive and went the way of 
chlorophyll martinis and pet rocks. So now we have Good Idea No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' latest suggestion has raised cries of protest by civil libertarians, 
mothers of teen-agers and those inclined, as he says, to "blast some pot on a 
casual basis." Not the best choice of words, but the man's a cop, not a poet. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed to explain what he meant by wanting to shoot casual users, Gates 
said he meant just that. Blow 'em right out of their Dockers. But he failed to 
explain what advantages this would offer society. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making a cop's job easier by simply shooting a druggie rather 
than being forced to drag him through due process, you also hit crime right at 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are properly shot will never go on to become burglars, rapists, 
killers, inside traders, spies, journalists, flag burners, Democrats or others 
of a suspicious nature. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting crime in the crib, so to speak, is not only convenient, it's 
patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
Gates isn't the first chief to recommend a method of crime control guaranteed 
to make our lives easier. 
</P>
<P>
A predecessor, Ed Davis, suggested several years ago that people who hijacked 
airplanes ought to be hanged at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to set up a portable court in a bus, try the hijacker en route from 
jail to LAX and then string him up on the Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
The idea made sense, not only because it simplified a tedious process, but also 
because it was rooted in tradition. Giving 'em a fair trial and then hanging 
'em was, after all, how we won the West. 
</P>
<P>
While the idea never caught on, we were so pleased with Ed's thought processes, 
we elected him to the California state Senate, in whose intellectual body he 
continues to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent to that, Santa Monica Police Chief James Keane, not to be outdone by 
the cowboys in L.A., came up with yet another way of dealing with those 
inclined to felonious pursuit. He sent them to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
To many, of course, this is a fate worse than death. Being shot by Gates or 
hanged at the airport by Davis is preferable to a long sentence in a city 
where, as Lenny Bruce once said, neon goes to die. 
</P>
<P>
What precipitated Keane's action, you might recall, is that a Miami judge 
ordered a prostitute to serve time in Santa Monica. But while she was here, the 
sex market collapsed and she was never heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
The felon sent to Miami, on the other hand, apparently found the weather and 
the social climate to his liking and almost immediately exposed himself in 
public. I'm not sure what happened to him after that, but I hear he was 
sentenced to life in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
It might surprise you that I am willing to discuss the Chief's crime-prevention 
technique in such rational, non-hysterical terms. It's just that I feel it has 
potential in other areas of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
If we shot a few oil barons, for instance, there would probably be less 
price-gouging, and one or two S&amp;L executives might think twice about 
ripping us off if they faced a similar form of instant reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked others who they'd like to see shot, they mentioned lawyers, perky 
news anchors, insurance claims adjusters, pit bull owners and people who hold 
their crotches while singing the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
They don't have to be criminals to qualify. Anyone you don't like will do. 
</P>
<P>
My own preference is drivers who cut in front of me and doctors who employ the 
editorial we to discuss my pain. I mean our pain. 
</P>
<P>
If you play the game correctly, you'll see the point Chief Gates was trying to 
make, despite later efforts by his army of apologists to say 
what-the-chief-really-meant-was. 
</P>
<P>
I think he meant what he said. Don't coddle 'em. Don't arrest 'em. Don't ride 
'em out of town. Blow 'em to hell, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
Wise-ass sales clerks, kids who cut school, members of the ACLU, cop-haters, 
liberal politicians, crying babies . . . line 'em up.

<P>
Your editorial of Aug. 28 was critical of my resolution concerning the teaching 
of America's World War II Act excluding those of Japanese descent from the war 
zone and our subsequent relocation policy. You attacked me declaring, "he wants 
his inaccurate and dangerous version . . . included in textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout your editorial you accused me of wanting to rewrite American 
history. You are wrong. The whole purpose of my effort was to negate a measure 
last year that does urge educators to teach a revisionist history of the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Legislature passed a resolution that told educators to teach 
that period of our history as a denial of human rights, caused by war hysteria, 
poor leadership and America's racism. They also urged that the war and military 
necessity not be taught as any justification whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
There were many causes and reasons that motivated America's decision regarding 
Roosevelt's War Zone Exclusionary Order. I agree that war hysteria, poor 
leadership and racism were three of the many causes, but to deny that the 
attack on Pearl Harbor and the war acts off our shore also affected those 
decisions is preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
My resolution simply said that teachers should make use of a broad array of 
historic research and instructional material.

WESTHEAD VOWS TO TAKE RUNNING GAME TO DENVER; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: FORMER LOYOLA MARYMOUNT COACH IS INTRODUCED AS NUGGETS' NEW BOSS, 
BUT OFFICIALS AT THE SCHOOL HAD YET TO HEAR FROM HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of basketball practice about five weeks away, Paul Westhead's 
sudden departure as coach has left the Loyola Marymount athletic program 
scrambling like a Lion fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westhead was introduced as coach of the NBA's Denver Nuggets Friday, 
succeeding the fired Doug Moe, the Loyola administration, coaches and players 
still had not heard from him and were awaiting his return. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Brian Quinn said that because Westhead's name came up so 
often in job rumors, he had a contingency plan to hire a new coach. But he was 
unprepared for the suddenness of the change. The Nuggets approached Westhead 
Wednesday night, and the deal was done by Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete shock," Quinn said. "It came out of nowhere. I've always 
prepared for the day this would happen, but I didn't think it would happen this 
suddenly -- in one day." 
</P>
<P>
It is believed by some that part of the reason Westhead was willing to leave on 
such short notice was the annual dickering on his handshake contract he faced 
with Fr. James Loughran, the school president. 
</P>
<P>
And those sources said that Loughran, although friendly with Westhead, felt the 
basketball program was outgrowing the scope of Loyola athletics. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, neither spoke critically of the other. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran issued a statement, saying: "Paul's many friends and fans at Loyola 
Marymount join me in wishing him and his family every success in his new 
position. . . . He brought us five exciting basketball seasons and established 
an enviable record for the Lions. With his reputation and talent, we are not 
surprised that he was sought for an NBA coaching position, and we are pleased 
that he leaves us as such a good friend. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Denver, Westhead said: "I have a great love 
for the college game, and perhaps I would have stayed at Loyola Marymount 
forever if not for the opportunity to coach in the NBA. This was a chance I 
could not turn down." 
</P>
<P>
Terms of Westhead's multiyear contract were not disclosed. Bernie Bickerstaff, 
the Nuggets' new general manager, said his plan for rebuilding the team would 
take three to five years, and Westhead said his contract "puts me in the thick 
of those years." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said he had not learned until Wednesday night that the Denver job 
might be available. That's when he met with Bickerstaff. 
</P>
<P>
A Shakespearean scholar, Westhead quoted Macbeth, saying, "If it is done, when 
'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said he hoped to name a coach quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite is Jay Hillock, Westhead's top assistant during his five years at 
Loyola. Hillock was formerly head coach at Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock spoke with Westhead Thursday and Friday. "It's the fastest I've ever 
seen something like this happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn and Loyola probably will consider applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead's Loyola teams set NCAA scoring records, and he said at the Denver 
news conference that his up-tempo style would be just as effective in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, my team scored as many as 181 points in a game," Westhead said. 
"Now we have eight more minutes. You haven't seen anything yet. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be the fastest-paced team on offense and defense that you'll see. We're 
going to knock your socks off. If you wear a neck brace, you won't be able to 
stay for all of our games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'll work diligently to have the best conditioned team in all of professional 
sports. Starting out, win or lose, I can promise you our opponents will be very 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead is expected back Monday to meet with the Loyola team. Players and 
coaches met Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd heard the rumors, but I thought once we got back to school he was in for 
the season," said junior forward John O'Connell. "I didn't believe it at first, 
but we've been through worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was upset -- we didn't want to lose him. But we're as happy for him 
as anybody. It's a great opportunity, and we'll go on, like usual."

HOCKEY: KINGS OPEN TRAINING CAMP TODAY. MCSORLEY REPORTS LATE AND IS FINED 
$500.

HULL, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's still summer, according to the calendar, just the start of the stretch run 
for baseball and only the opening kickoff for football, but, ready or not, here 
comes hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Four and a half months after limping off the Forum ice, swept out of the 1990 
playoffs by the eventual champion Edmonton Oilers, the Kings return to the ice 
today on the other side of the continent for the beginning of another training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three players will be involved in today's two opening scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
Among them will be Wayne Gretzky, who ended last season watching agonizingly 
from a Forum seat, sidelined by a back injury. Gretzky's was just one name on a 
Kings' injury list that included half the squad by season's end. 
</P>
<P>
"It took seven weeks until I felt better," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
So no lingering problems? 
</P>
<P>
"I won't know until I get hit." 
</P>
<P>
Not so lucky is defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who went out with a back injury on 
March 17 and has yet to return. 
</P>
<P>
He is receiving cortisone shots, but Coach Tom Webster said, "It would be a 
bonus if he could come back by the middle of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: The Kings aren't counting on him. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow defenseman Bob Halkidis, recovering from off-season shoulder surgery, 
isn't here either. He is expected back next month, around the time of the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the missing Thursday, the deadline for reporting, was defenseman 
Marty McSorley. He arrived Friday and was fined about $500, the maximum 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
His agent, Michael Barnett, said McSorley's tardiness was caused by "a personal 
matter," but that didn't seem to satisfy General Manager Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," Vachon said. "Very disappointed. I didn't expect that. It 
came out of the blue. I don't want to start camp like this. I don't think his 
reason was very important, but, it happened." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Darryl Sydor, the team's top draft choice, has a cast on one hand 
after breaking a knuckle in a junior game last week. . . . The newest King, 
goalie Daniel Berthiaume, obtained for Craig Duncanson in a trade with the 
Minnesota North Stars on Thursday, will be starting his fifth full season in 
the NHL with a record of 51-48-13 and a goals-against average of 3.62. He will 
be in a tough fight with Ron Scott and Mario Gosselin for the backup goalie's 
job behind Kelly Hrudey, according to Vachon. "He'll have to earn the job," the 
Kings' general manager said. "We're not just going to give it to him." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster plans to leave Hull with a traveling squad of 35 players, the 
rest being split evenly between the Kings' American Hockey League club, the New 
Haven Nighthawks, and their new farm team, the Phoenix Roadrunners of the 
International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will be in camp here a week, then will start their 10-game exhibition 
schedule next Friday against the Nordiques in Quebec. The Kings will play the 
Pittsburgh Penguins five times -- in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Dallas and 
Houston -- the New York Rangers in Miami and the Vancouver Canucks in Seattle 
and Vancouver. Then they'll return home for their only Forum exhibition game 
Sept. 29 against the New York Islanders. They will open the regular season 
against the Islanders on Oct. 4.

MELVIN DURSLAG: MAYBE NINE NO-HITTERS ARE JUST RESULTS OF LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To date, scientists in the field have tendered the following explanations for 
the record nine no-hitters dispensed by pitchers in the major leagues this 
year: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ball is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gloves are larger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fences are softer, allowing flyhawks to crash into them and catch balls 
they would have been unable to catch crashing into hard fences. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Talent is diluted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spring training was shortened; batters never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barometric pressures have worked against the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Official scorers are suspect, changing hits to errors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whopping contracts are tempting hitters to go after bad pitches; one 
doesn't get $3 million for walking. 
</P>
<P>
This is a serious matter, especially pertaining to the ball Wade Boggs has 
assayed as an eighth of an inch smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Whipping out his jeweler's glass, Tom Lasorda inspects the ball and reports it 
hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't what he said in 1987 when a record 2,634 home runs were struck. 
By July 1, Mark McGwire alone had hit 28. George Bell had 27. 
</P>
<P>
Through their spokesman, Sparky Anderson, selected for his Churchillian 
eloquence, Lasorda, Whitey Herzog and maybe half a dozen other managers 
announced: 
</P>
<P>
"When certain hitters who are lucky to hit four homers all year have hit 16 by 
the All-Star break, we are not playing with the same ball as before." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt submitted it wasn't the ball at all. It was the growing incidence 
of split-finger fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
"When the split-finger doesn't split, you've got a nothing pitch," Schmidt 
testified. "The split-finger is making hitters rich." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Phil Niekro, a once vaunted warrior, now a coach with Atlanta, credits the 
split-finger for the no-hit epidemic today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the pitch of the age," Phil says. "It fools a lot of batters." 
</P>
<P>
Informed that Boggs sees the baseball as fractionally smaller this year, Niekro 
responds: 
</P>
<P>
"When a ball collapses at the plate or travels 95 (m.p.h.), it seems smaller to 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseballs have been produced since 1977 by Rawlings, which sends 
the materials to a factory in Haiti for assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
Told that voodoo has been practiced for centuries in Haiti, baseball scholars 
tapped the old scalp. Haitians wrapping the balls were giving them the 
spiritual dipsy-do. 
</P>
<P>
Then as fast as it came, the home run explosion vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew why," a Rawlings man explained. "We had switched back to the old 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
"And there actually was no change in baseballs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not. The formula has been the same ever since we started making 
them." 
</P>
<P>
And Rawlings insists that the formula for the balls used in today's no-hitters 
is identical to that the year all the home runs were hit. 
</P>
<P>
So what created that rash of homers in '87? 
</P>
<P>
"Very likely a passing surge of strength on the part of the hitters," the 
Rawlings man answered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, we may be witnessing a passing surge of strength by pitchers. The 
previous record for no-hitters in a season was seven, posted in 1917 when many 
prime hitters had entered the service of their government. 
</P>
<P>
So, you ask, if the hitters entered the service, what were the pitchers doing? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: They were throwing no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
If the Persian Gulf involvement should lead to conscription in America, hitters 
wish to drop the reminder it is the pitchers' turn to go. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all these explanations for no-hitters, but no one mentions luck," 
Niekro says. "I threw a no-hitter against San Diego in 1973. My stuff that day 
was nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"But our second baseman makes a great stop on one play. And, on another, our 
shortstop flags down a tough grounder. The throw is late. They give the 
shortstop an error. It should have been ruled a hit. That's what I mean about 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
He reflects a moment on the no-hit phenomenon, then continues: 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Holtzman threw a no-hitter for the Cubs without striking out a batter. If 
everyone gets wood on the ball, don't you think a pitcher needs luck? And look 
at that Andy Hawkins with the Yankees. He throws a no-hitter this year -- and 
loses, 4-0." 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the Hawkins case was, the ball was so small that day the 
Yankees couldn't field it.

REDS' ATTITUDE: DODGERS STILL HAVE TO CATCH US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Try talking pennant pressure with the Western Division-leading Reds and it's a 
one-sided conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds clubhouse is quieter than when the Reds had a double-digit lead, but 
it remains calm. There were no heads hanging or tantrums thrown after Friday's 
3-1 loss to the Dodgers, which trimmed Cincinnati's lead to 5 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was admitting to hearing the Dodgers creeping from behind or to feeling 
they had let a game slip away. The Reds held the Dodgers to three hits but made 
two costly errors and walked seven batters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about the pennant race," Red Manager Lou Piniella said. 
Why not? "I just don't feel like it. What'd (the Dodgers) have, four errors? We 
just didn't capitalize. We walked a few hitters early in the game, didn't cover 
third. It cost us a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored all their runs against Jose Rijo, who had won three games in 
a row. Rijo allowed one earned run but walked six and made a costly mental 
error. He gave up a run in the first inning when he walked three of the first 
four batters and gave up a sacrifice fly to Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored another run in the fourth inning when Barry Larkin misplayed 
a grounder by Mike Sharperson, who eventually scored on two singles. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' last run came in the sixth when Mike Scioscia led off with a walk 
and scored when Sharperson singled and right fielder Paul O'Neill threw the 
ball past third base, into the Dodger dugout. O'Neill drew the error, but 
Piniella said Rijo gets some of the blame for forgetting to back up third. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he broke to first, then had a mental lapse and forgot to get behind 
(third)," Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
A surprisingly upbeat Rijo said: "It's very frustrating, a lot, especially when 
I've got good stuff -- my best stuff all year. I was so strong I just couldn't 
control myself. I was trying to throw too hard instead of concentrating on 
putting the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
However, Rijo and teammates said pressure remains on the Dodgers. "We don't got 
no pressure," Rijo said. "We're in first place -- they got to come to us. All 
we gotta do is play good baseball. (The Dodgers) got a good team, but it's not 
going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Hal Morris, who had two of the Reds' four hits, said the thought 
of pennant pressure "hasn't even entered my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Layana, the former Loyola Marymount All-American who pitched in the eighth 
inning, said: "It's up to us. We've just got to go out, play good and win. This 
game would've been nice to win, but we could go out and win the next two. We're 
playing good ball." 
</P>
<P>
Recent results -- the Reds have lost four of their last five -- would indicate 
otherwise, but Piniella said he won't be giving any lectures or pep talks. 
"What do I need to tell 'em?" he said. "We've played 130-some games. They know 
what to do, for God's sake."

Heavyweight Riddick Bowe remained undefeated, stopping former World Boxing 
Council champion Pinklon Thomas on an eighth-round technical knockout at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 17th knockout for Bowe (19-0), who battered Thomas through most of 
the scheduled 10-rounder until the 32-year-old fighter could not answer the 
bell for the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
The victory is expected to earn Bowe a bout against Bert Cooper on the 
undercard of the Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield title fight Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a learning experience and Pinklon brought the best out in me," Bowe 
said. "Some say he's washed up, a has-been. But he brought out the best in me. 
I don't care what any of you guys say." 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth round, Thomas was staggered but wouldn't fall as Bowe weakened him 
with a series of quick combinations. Bowe swung freely for Thomas' head in the 
last three rounds as many in the crowd shouted for referee Sylvester Stevens to 
stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas shook his head at Stevens after stumbling back to his corner after the 
eighth, finally ending the fight.

Leonard L. Kleinman, executive vice president of the New York Yankees, 
testified for two hours on the second day of his hearing before Commissioner 
Fay Vincent, then the proceedings were recessed for at least 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent is inquiring about Kleinman's role in the $40,000 payment made by 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to gambler Howard Spira and what Kleinman did 
to help Spira establish a bank account. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Costello, one of Kleinman's attorneys, would not characterize his 
client's testimony but said the hearing would not resume until Sept. 17 at the 
earliest. Costello said Kleinman would continue his testimony when the hearing 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, after an investigation and hearing by the commissioner into his 
dealings with Spira, was ordered to resign as general partner and to give up 
his day-to-day control of the Yankees.

THOMAS LEADS MUIR PAST PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Muir High football team has been among the most talented teams in 
the Southland in recent years. A lack of discipline on the field, however, has 
kept the Mustangs from competing with top programs. 
</P>
<P>
Muir Coach John Tyree is slowly changing that, as evidenced by his team's 
season-opening victory over Palmdale, 38-13, Friday night in a Southern Section 
nonleague game at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, the Times' fifth-rated team, trailed Palmdale, 13-0, midway through the 
first quarter. Struggling to establish an offense, Muir players seemed to be 
losing patience. 
</P>
<P>
But Tyree, in his second season at the school, has stressed patience and 
discipline, and it showed when the team regrouped in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale, coming off a 3-8 season, was outscored, 25-0, in the second half. 
Muir quarterback Sedrick Thomas, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound senior, orchestrated the 
turnaround. He passed for more than 250 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown 
pass to Demetrice Martin for the final score of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas ran the option to perfection, picking up 70 yards. His one-yard 
touchdown run early in the fourth quarter gave Muir a 24-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ragged and sloppy," Tyree said. "But the thing about the Mustangs is 
that we play four quarters of football." 
</P>
<P>
Muir turned things around in the third quarter after blowing an opportunity to 
take the lead. The Mustangs drove from their 20-yard line to the Palmdale one 
after the kickoff, but running back Linza Williams fumbled and Palmdale 
defensive back Anthony Ortega recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon quarterback Rodney Williams was tackled for a safety on the next play, 
giving Muir the lead for good, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
Even the kicking game was on target for Muir in the second half. Jason Aniline 
converted a 27-yard field goal to increase the Mustangs' lead, 18-13. 
</P>
<P>
"Things opened up in the second half," Tyree said, "and Sedrick (Thomas) is a 
talented guy and we got a lot of short passes." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale caught Muir napping on the first play of the game. The Falcons called 
a halfback pass, and Ortega connected with senior receiver Paul DeAngelo for a 
79-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Muir gambled on its first possession, faking a punt on fourth-and-nine from its 
23. Thomas' pass was incomplete and Palmdale took over. Three minutes later, 
running back Vashon Lecesne scored a touchdown from three yards out to put the 
Falcons ahead, 13-0.

ZERTUCHE PASSES BISHOP AMAT OVER RUBIDOUX

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior quarterback Zach Zertuche passed for three touchdowns and ran for 
another to lead Bishop Amat to a 37-7 season-opening, nonleague victory over 
Riverside Rubidoux at La Puente Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Zertuche connected with Art Cuellar for touchdowns of 27, 47 and 25 yards and 
scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, who are ranked third in the Times' Southern Section poll, also had 
a big game from junior Scott Fields, who scored on a 49-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica St. Monica 7, Van Nuys Montclair Prep 6 -- A failed point-after 
attempt was the difference as the Mariners defeated the Mounties at Culver City 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 7-0, Montclair Prep (0-2) scored with 2:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
With All-American tailback Derek Sparks gone for the season -- he withdrew from 
school Wednesday afternoon -- sophomore Eliel Swinton scored on a nine-yard 
run, but the conversion kick was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne 20, Antelope Valley 6 -- Quarterback Jamil Williams connected with 
Tarrick Brock on touchdown passes of 52 and 28 yards to lead the Cougars at 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 28, Corona del Mar 0 -- The Oilers outgained the Sea Kings in 
total yardage, 322-109, and converted two blocked punts into touchdowns at 
Orange Coast College.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DUI SUSPECT SEIZED AFTER 25-MILE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hair-raising, 100-m.p.h.-plus car chase that covered 25 miles of freeway from 
Orange County to the South Bay ended early Friday when five California Highway 
Patrol officers and a Redondo Beach police dog caught up with a suspected drunk 
driver on Pacific Coast Highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Paul Sadler, 28, of Santa Ana was arrested after the 14-minute chase up 
and down the San Diego Freeway, CHP Officer Rich Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler was treated for dog bites at South Bay Hospital, then transferred to the 
jail ward at County-USC Medical Center, Richards said. He was booked on charges 
of resisting arrest, assault on a peace officer and driving under the influence 
of a controlled substance.

Forget the fact that for 228,569 students attending 208 year-round schools in 
Los Angeles County, it's more like the un-back-to-school season. It's that time 
of year again and, as of this week, most of the 1.6 million children attending 
public schools in Los Angeles County were once again filing into classrooms. 
The end of summer vacation brings with it an opportunity to ruminate on some 
facts and observations about our schools: 
</P>
<P>
* Number of year-round schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District in 
1974: 2. 
</P>
<P>
* Number of schools the LAUSD hopes to operate year-round by July, 1991: 611. 
</P>
<P>
* There are 1,565 schools outside LAUSD on the traditional calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
* Eighty-two school districts operate countywide, with a total of 1,603 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
* Only 14% of public school students countywide have year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
* Of the 208 year-round schools in the county, the LAUSD operates 170. 
</P>
<P>
* Estimated number of public school teachers in Los Angeles County: 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Average student-to-classroom ratio in 1979: 27.2. 
</P>
<P>
* Average student-to-classroom ratio in 1989: 29.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Likely Current Events Topic: 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to discuss with the kids if they think . . . Saddam Hussein is a 
parallel with Hitler during World War II. And I want to know if they think the 
Constitution should be rewritten with regards to the war powers of the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Denis, world history teacher, Santa Monica High School 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's Out: 
</P>
<P>
Many school districts warn against -- and some ban -- wearing the following 
items of clothing because they could be mistaken for gang attire: Hats, hair 
nets, curlers, bandannas, overalls with straps hanging down, colored 
shoestrings, earrings, all-black clothing, gray pants and white shirts, 
armbands, 
</P>
<P>
black-web belts, fabric belts with cut-out initials, British Knight tennis 
shoes, see-through football jerseys, and clothing with L.A. Raiders emblems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's On Its Way Out: 
</P>
<P>
Florescent colors. Dick Tracy, Simpson's and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
What's In: 
</P>
<P>
For younger pupils, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle lunch boxes and Little Mermaid 
backpacks. Stirrup pants in bright floral and geometric patterns for little 
girls. For teen-age boys, elastic waist beach pants. For teen-age girls, long 
shirts with draw-string waists, stretch pants and ankle-high boots. 
</P>
<P>
Just Say No: 
</P>
<P>
* DARE, the Los Angeles Police Department's Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
program, sends officers into approximately 503 of the LAUSD's 611 schools to 
teach children to turn away drug pushers. 
</P>
<P>
* SANE, the Sheriff Department's Substance Abuse Narcotics Education program, 
sends officers into 384 elementary schools countywide to help kids say no to 
drugs.

ONLY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Harvey

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's heartening to see that L.A. residents and businesses have cut back water 
usage by 13%. More hopeful signs abound, too. Mayor Tom Bradley promises that 
his gardeners won't water so much. And the Department of Water and Power has 
surrendered one of its treasured perks. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP has agreed to share with city firefighters the "gate keys" needed to 
turn off broken fire hydrants. In the past when firefighters responded to a 
burst hydrant, they had to wait for a DWP rep to arrive. Last year, about 1,300 
hydrants burst in L.A., losing about 292 million gallons of water (enough to 
serve 3,200 households a year, or 3,199 if you include Bradley's). 
</P>
<P>
Some saw the DWP's past refusal to allow firefighters to deactivate hydrants as 
bureaucratic rivalry. The DWP maintained that the task required "specialized 
training." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, at a press conference, two firefighters demonstrated how to turn 
off a hydrant. They fit a T-shaped pole over the hydrant's valve. They grasped 
opposite sides of the "T." They turned it. The flow ceased. 
</P>
<P>
The "specialization" was apparent: They had to remember to turn the "T" in the 
same direction. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who open against Denver on Sunday in the L.A. Coliseum (their home 
this week), also kicked off the season in L.A. against the Broncos last year. 
They drew more than 90,000 fans for that game. 
</P>
<P>
Speculating on Sunday's turnout, USA Today columnist Tom Weir wrote: "Even in 
sprawling L.A., can there be that many suckers left?" 
</P>
<P>
L.A. often seems too freeway-busy to think about its past. But there is some 
history back there. Filmmaker Ken Burns recently visited the Drum Barracks 
Museum in Wilmington to present a copy of his forthcoming PBS series on the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
A few thousand Union troops were stationed at the barracks during the conflict, 
partly out of fears that Confederate sympathizers in L.A. might lead a revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The barracks was also the home for about 80 camels imported from Egypt for use 
in the Southwest desert. Despite their strength and stamina, the humpbacks got 
only mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd scare the horses and the neighborhood kids would laugh," said Marge 
O'Brien, the museum director. "One Army commander wrote that the camels ruined 
military dignity." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, many of the dromedaries were turned loose in the desert, where 
one named Topsy was reportedly found as late as 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, a publicist for the PBS series says that neither the Drum Barracks nor 
the Camel Corps made the PBS series. Once again, L.A.'s history has been left 
on the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
A true lounge lizard: 
</P>
<P>
A 2-foot-long iguana was stolen from Hermosa Beach, Officer Charles Wilhite 
reported, after thieves "cut through a screen on a kitchen window and 
apparently coaxed the uncaged victim out of his home." 
</P>
<P>
For its "back-to-school sale," the downtown California Mart is advertising such 
items as fashion jewelry, lingerie and evening wear. The last is obviously for 
night students.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBER FAKES GUN, IS SHOT BY VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who faked a gun was shot by the real thing when the woman he attempted to 
rob pulled a gun out of a drawer in her Hollywood home, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name and address were not disclosed, wounded the robber, who 
was captured by police about a block away, Sgt. Tammy Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had stopped her car at a light in Los Angeles late Thursday when a 
man opened the unlocked passenger door and got in, faking a gun and ordering 
her to drive home, Tatreau said. She tried to take him to a different address, 
but he found her actual address in papers in the glove compartment, then 
ordered her to take him there. 
</P>
<P>
At the home, the man took a knife from the kitchen and struck her on the head. 
She told him she had money in a drawer, pulled out a .357-magnum handgun and 
fired five times, striking him four times in the arm and abdomen, Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was treated at County-USC Medical Center and booked in the jail ward 
on suspicion of robbery and kidnaping.

EFFORTS TO TRAP WILD ANIMALS STEPPED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dramatic increase in the number of wild animals wandering from parched 
hillsides into urban neighborhoods for food and water has prompted animal 
regulation officials to step up efforts to trap and return the creatures to the 
wild.

"It's been a bumper year for opossums," said Dennis Kroeplin, a city wildlife 
control officer, who has relocated more than 1,600 opossums trapped in the San 
Fernando Valley this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never caught so many opossums before," said Kroeplin, as he prepared to 
release his latest load Friday in the San Gabriel Mountains. His van was loaded 
with 32 grunting and hissing opossums and seven stoically silent raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a month, the city's six animal shelters from Chatsworth to San Pedro 
bring wild animals to Van Nuys Airport, where they are taken by helicopter to 
remote areas, often near Pyramid Lake in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Animal Regulation started the airlifts in 1969 and usually 
ferries about 30 to 40 animals each trip. But this year, up to 90 animals -- 
opossums, raccoons, snakes and an occasional fox -- are being airlifted each 
time, said Lt. James Phipps of the North Hollywood shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps and Kroeplin blamed the increase on the lingering drought and the spread 
of new housing tracts into once wild canyons and hills. 
</P>
<P>
The extra airlifts are another example of how drought and development have made 
wild animals and humans uncomfortable neighbors. Recently, bears have been 
raiding the snack bar almost nightly at Pyramid Lake, ripping open food lockers 
in search of hamburger patties and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps said he trapped 113 coyotes in the San Fernando Valley during the last 
year. That's an increase of about 25% over the previous year. Coyotes have 
taken to traveling the flood control channels and are showing up in unlikely 
venues such as West Hills and Van Nuys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other animal control agencies are responding to growing numbers of complaints 
about wild animals drinking from swimming pools or gobbling up food left 
outside for pets. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, opossums, raccoons and skunks have descended on the city "by the 
droves," said Susan Niemeyer, operations manager for the Pasadena Humane 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the dryness in the hills and the lack of food," Niemeyer said. Still, it 
is normal during the late summer months for large numbers of animals to travel 
down from the hills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A scheduled airlift from Van Nuys airport was scrubbed Friday for mechanical 
repairs, so Kroeplin loaded up raccoons and opossums collected from the San 
Fernando Valley's two shelters and drove to a secluded canyon in the Angeles 
National Forest above Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
"This won't be a mad dash for freedom," he observed as he prepared to release 
the first opossums of the day. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. Opossums are not swift creatures, and although they may not be 
dumber than a box of rocks, they are not a whole lot smarter. 
</P>
<P>
When Kroeplin opened the cage door, the opossums just stared ahead before 
slowly padding away. Some of the marsupials didn't leave until Kroeplin shook 
the cage. One critter took a full 30 seconds before leaving. The raccoons, 
however, tend to rocket to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He released the animals far from the mountain road for their own protection. 
"They're liable to go right up to the road and get killed," he said of the 
opossums. 
</P>
<P>
They're that dumb? 
</P>
<P>
With a slight nod, Kroeplin said: "They're that dumb." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are they overly graceful. 
</P>
<P>
After freeing the animals, Kroeplin heard a rustling of leaves in a nearby tree 
and looked up to see an opossum plummet from a high branch like an overripe 
avocado. 
</P>
<P>
The opossum righted itself, regained its bearings and waddled off into the dry 
riverbed.

</P>
<P>
THERAPY: ILLITERACY AS A CAUSE AND EFFECT OF DRUG DEPENDENCY IS ATTACKED AT 
ACTON REHABILITATION CENTER. TUTORS ARE FELLOW SUBSTANCE ABUSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He spent four years at the University of Houston, playing wide receiver, 
majoring in psychology. But when Gary Sapp left the university to join the 
Houston Oilers in 1979, he could not even read a menu or write a check. 
</P>
<P>
What he could do was play football with abandon, especially if he was high on 
cocaine, which he often was. Who needed to read or write when there were drugs 
and money and fame? 
</P>
<P>
Today, as Sapp looks back on a helter-skelter past and a pro career that was 
clipped short by liquor and drugs, he realizes that his addiction was tied 
intrinsically to his illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
And so, to kick his habit and rebuild his life, he is learning, at the age of 
36, to read. 
</P>
<P>
Sapp is one of about 100 recovering drug addicts and alcoholics at the Acton 
Rehabilitation Center participating in an innovative year-old program, perhaps 
the only one of its kind in the country, which uses the simple act of reading 
as part of the treatment of chemical dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Illiterate addicts are taught to read by fellow substance abusers who have been 
trained as tutors. The result: The self-esteem of both rises and their chances 
of completing the rehabilitation center's 90-day recovery program increase 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy alone probably will not drive someone to drugs, experts say, but the 
inability to read can, to some extent, be a cause and an effect of substance 
abuse. Low self-worth, a loss of hope and slim chances of landing a good job -- 
all byproducts of illiteracy -- contribute to the desire to turn to drugs as an 
escape, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Being illiterate played a big part in my addiction," Sapp said. He was so 
ashamed of himself, for example, that Sapp once wore an eye patch, feigning 
injury, to have others read for him. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of treatment in Acton, Sapp reads at a seventh-grade level. "I 
like myself now," he said. "I'm tired of living in shadows." 
</P>
<P>
Before entering the reading program, 55% of the center's clients completed the 
90-day residency program, said Richard Rioux, director of special projects at 
the center. But for the program's students and tutors, he said, the completion 
rate is 80%. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in completion rates has surprised counselors at the center, 
especially because the literacy program is so simple, both in philosophy and 
execution. Almost sheepishly, Rioux said, "Why didn't we think of it sooner?" 
</P>
<P>
The need for literacy training was discovered by accident about two years ago 
after the center, which is run by the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services, tried to launch a job training program in Acton and at a sister 
facility in Warm Springs in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors soon realized that about a third of the residents could not fill out 
a job application or read classified ads, Rioux said. About half read at the 
seventh-grade level or below. 
</P>
<P>
With a $60,000 federal grant, the center launched the literacy program in 
January, 1989, at the two centers. Tutors were trained in techniques used by 
Literacy Volunteers of America and now each person admitted to the residence 
center is tested in reading and math. Participation in the program, however, is 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
The tutors and students work one-on-one in their rooms, in the library or even 
on the athletic fields at the rehabilitation center, a secluded village-like 
compound of cabins and bungalows located about 47 miles north of downtown Los 
Angeles. Built as a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the 1930s, the 130-acre 
center is quiet and peaceful, surrounded by gently sloping hills. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 265 students and 135 tutors have completed the literacy program, Rioux 
said. A third of the Acton center's 300 residents currently participate; 
another 200 do so in Warm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are referred to the center by private and public social agencies, the 
courts, hospitals and halfway houses. Some, such as Sapp, admit themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in literacy said the program is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Reading programs are becoming increasingly common in prisons -- where 76% of 
the inmates nationwide read below the sixth-grade level -- and in shelters for 
the homeless, said Jody Koloski, executive director of the American Assn. for 
Adult and Continuing Education in Washington. Researchers have long recognized 
that illiteracy and the low self-esteem it engenders contributes to, but does 
not necessarily cause, a host of social ills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But combining reading with drug and alcohol rehabilitation is rare, if not 
unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place I know where that's being done," said Juanita Stanley, 
executive director of California Literacy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite new," said Beverly Miller, a spokeswoman for Literacy Volunteers 
of America, based in Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to say how Acton residents will fare when they leave the 
program. Recovering addicts often slide back into abuse before they finally 
come clean, Rioux said. "We've had people in here with 17 or 18 programs behind 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sapp, for example, tried to rehabilitate himself once before. He enrolled at 
the Acton center in 1984 and briefly stayed off drugs and alcohol before he 
resumed the high-flying lifestyle he adopted at the University of Houston, 
where overzealous alumni slipped him envelopes stuffed with $500 for each 
touchdown he scored. 
</P>
<P>
Sapp left Houston nine units shy of a degree -- "entered a dummy and left a 
dummy" -- and started a brief professional career that included seasons with 
the Oilers, Raiders and Jets. Tumultuous years of using and selling drugs 
followed, Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Sapp reads the sports page and books by Alcoholics Anonymous. He's 
getting back in shape and looks like the pro athlete he once was and runs every 
morning and afternoon in the hills of Acton. Only his face, with its sad eyes, 
give hints of his addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I can read just about anything now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, about 20 to 30 tutors and students gather at the center library 
for the "tutor rap," an informal time to discuss their program and share tips 
on teaching. Like Sapp, many had tried unsuccessfully to rehabilitate 
themselves in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The intimate work of tutor and student creates bonds of friendship and love 
that give both the strength to succeed, said Bill O'Connor at the tutor rap 
last week. O'Connor, who teaches math to Christine Schuster from Palmdale, is a 
58-year-old recovering alcoholic who, ironically, was formerly the director of 
a substance abuse recovery program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Schuster, who never completed junior high, said O'Connor is unlike the other 
teachers she had in school. He cared, she said. "He was the best tutor I ever 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Some stories end in failure, but even the failures contain lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Phillippe de Ruise, known to everyone as Frenchy, said he could not 
understand why one of his students spurned him and refused to study. De Ruise 
blamed himself for his student's failure until he realized that the desire to 
read, like the desire to quit drugs, must come from within. 
</P>
<P>
So the tutor finally gave up. "I had to let him go," he said. "He didn't want 
it." The former student still can't read. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tony Frongello of Redondo Beach raised his hand to speak. A salesman 
for a cable TV company, Frongello had been skeptical when he enrolled in the 
literacy program. 
</P>
<P>
 They're going to have a drug addict like me teaching me to read? he thought. 
It couldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Frongello told how his tutor, Ralph Robertson, changed his life. 
"I didn't think I could read at all," he began. "I was ashamed to read in front 
of people." 
</P>
<P>
His voice thick with emotion, Frongello paused, struggling for the words, 
fighting back tears. The meeting room was uncomfortably quiet until tutor 
Annetta Daniel broke the tension. She threw out her arms and hugged him. The 
room erupted with applause and shouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Now this is what it is!" someone said, exuberantly. 
</P>
<P>
"I can read," Frongello said when noise died down. "I never really knew I could 
read that well. Now I can read whole books."

NO-CONTEST PLEA ENTERED ON 20 MOLESTATION CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
SEX CRIMES: LONG BEACH MAN HAD BEEN A SUPERVISOR IN THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF 
CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

<P>
A former county Department of Children's Services supervisor who had publicly 
questioned the moral taboos against sexual activity involving children pleaded 
no contest to 20 felony molestation charges Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Davis, 55, of Long Beach, had been charged with sexually assaulting six 
boys and one girl ranging in age from 1 to 9 years old, including his 
grandchildren and neighbors' children. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' stepson has also claimed that he was molested 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who is being held on $500,000 bail, could face several years in prison, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis entered his plea to 20 of 23 molestation charges just before a 
preliminary hearing was to begin to determine the weight of the evidence 
against him. The remaining three counts may be dismissed at sentencing, 
scheduled for Sept. 28 in Long Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a 28-year veteran social worker, who most recently worked as a 
supervisor at the department's Belvedere office in East Los Angeles, was 
arrested July 10 at his Long Beach home and fired about a month later. 
</P>
<P>
But the county agency was heavily criticized for failing to take action sooner, 
particularly after being made aware of letters Davis wrote to supervisors and 
other officials, saying that the county was too quick to brand sexual activity 
involving children as "abuse." 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to acknowledge that our norms for nonviolent, erotic experiences of 
young people in this society fail to reflect actual practice," Davis wrote in a 
July 14, 1989, letter to county Supervisor Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to begin to move away from criminal sanctions that seem to be based 
primarily on our need to punish irrationally the pleasure-seeking, loving 
drives of mankind," Davis also wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the letters, also sent to judges, the governor and several newspapers, 
were forwarded to the Department of Children's Services. But Davis was not 
fired until after his arrest.

'YEAH, I MEAN IT!' GATES SAYS OF IDEA TO SHOOT DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates refused to back away Friday from his 
suggestion that casual drug users be shot to death, telling hundreds of LAPD 
officers and supporters at a noon luncheon, "Yeah, I mean it!" 
</P>
<P>
The chief's pronouncement on recreational drug use has drawn mild to harsh 
criticism from city officials. Some said they have grown used to such 
"Gates-isms" -- deliberately outrageous statements made to shock the public and 
draw attention to an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Friday of Gates' remarks about casual drug users: "I'm 
not going to dignify that statement by a response." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky had more to say about Gates. "He must have been 
smoking some pretty bad stuff," he said. "He ought to explain himself. . . . I 
think for the chief of police of any American city to make such a suggestion is 
outrageous and ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing controversy, Gates appears entrenched in the job he has 
held for more than 12 years, and city leaders expressed little desire to rein 
him in. Most said they did not take Gates' remarks literally. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates, in his first public appearance since he told a Senate committee 
earlier this week that casual drug users "ought to be taken out and shot," said 
Friday he stood by his controversial proposal if it would end drug abuse in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had any regrets about his testimony in Washington on Wednesday, the 
police chief said: "Absolutely not. Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of our problems in America," he added. "We don't speak the truth. 
We're so frightened of opening our mouths in this country. Every politician in 
the nation is afraid to come out and say anything in strong terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not afraid. I said it. I'm glad I said it." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' own son, Lowell Gates, has a history of drug problems and a criminal 
record dating back a dozen years, including a 1988 conviction for being under 
the influence of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an addict," Chief Gates said. "He's not a casual user. He was a casual 
user, and that's what leads to addiction. And I think everybody ought to 
recognize that all the poor addicts shot themselves already. They don't need us 
to execute them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an addict," the chief said. "He shot himself." 
</P>
<P>
But Gates was particularly critical of casual users, describing them as 
traitors and hypocrites for allowing drug abuse to continue in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply am trying to call that to our attention," he said. "There are people 
dying all over this country, and we've still got people who just want to party. 
I think they're hypocrites. I think if we want to prosecute a war on drugs, 
we've got to get serious about our disdain for those who continue to sustain 
this war and aid the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what all the casual drug users do. I want casual drug users to 
recognize exactly how treasonous I think their acts are. All they are doing is 
contributing to sustaining the war effort. They're aiding and abetting the 
enemy. They're supporting the enemy. They're giving money to the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gates conceded that his proposal to shoot weekend drug users would 
never fly. "That's not going to happen," he said. "Everyone knows that. But it 
sure got their attention, didn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
He also blasted the press, especially The Times, for its reporting on his 
comments about casual drug users. He said the newspaper mentioned only his 
comments about marijuana smokers, although he also suggested in his testimony 
that cocaine users be executed as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical of the Los Angeles Times," he said. "They don't even tell the 
truth. All you mentioned was pot." 
</P>
<P>
Gates made his comments to reporters as he arrived at a luncheon for Los 
Angeles police officers being awarded the department's Medal of Valor. He 
opened his formal speech by saying, "Would all the casual drug users please 
rise?" a remark that drew long and sharp laughter from the hundreds of officers 
and Police Department supporters at the Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has aroused controversy with his statements almost since the beginning of 
his tenure as police chief. In 1980, he suggested that his SWAT team could 
rescue the American hostages in Iran, prompting an unappreciative communique 
from the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Later, during a closed dinner meeting of deputy district attorneys, he 
described a local television newscaster as "an Aryan broad." He publicly 
apologized after the word got out, saying he meant the description "in jest." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he upset the black community when The Times quoted him on the use of 
the carotid chokehold. "We may be finding," Gates said, "that in some blacks 
when a (carotid restraint) is applied, the veins or arteries do not open up as 
fast as they do on normal people." He later conceded that it was a poor choice 
of words. 
</P>
<P>
While council members Friday criticized Gates for his most recent statement, 
none said they would call for his resignation and most said they believe he is 
a good police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, chairman of the council committee that oversees 
the Police Department, said he takes Gates' statements with a grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's in the typical style of Daryl Gates. . . . It's kind of 
Gates-ism. He shocks people into reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' strength with council members apparently is founded in his longtime 
attention to the complaints and needs of their council districts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been very responsive whenever I've had problems with officers in my 
area," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina. Councilman Robert Farrell said he was 
"shocked" by Gates' recent statement, but added that Gates is "a very good 
administrator. . . . He's responsive to me."

'BIG GREEN' SEEN COSTING L.A. BIG BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Proposition 128, the sweeping environmental initiative on the November ballot, 
could cost the city of Los Angeles $6 billion or more to implement if approved 
by voters, according to a report by the city's chief legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The report, obtained by The Times, said the preliminary estimates are "likely 
to understate the actual cost" of complying over the next 15 to 20 years with 
the initiative's requirements to clean up smog-producing Department of Water 
and Power plants. 
</P>
<P>
The study is one of the few independent estimates of the potential costs of the 
initiative, labeled "Big Green" by its proponents, and is likely to add new 
fuel to the emotional debate over the financial impact of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 128 have estimated its total cost to California 
taxpayers at $6 billion to $12 billion, with the cost to business and industry 
many billions of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the ballot measure say those estimates are wildly inflated 
and they insist there will be no negative financial impact if Proposition 128 
is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The report by William McCarley, chief legislative analyst for the city of Los 
Angeles, said that other city departments such as Sanitation, General Services, 
Street Maintenance, Harbor and Airports also would likely face significant 
costs in complying with the measure. 
</P>
<P>
If the estimates prove accurate, the expenditures could lead to significant 
increases in water, power and sewer rates, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The exact price tag is difficult to determine and is subject to widely 
differing interpretations and assumptions on how the initiative would be 
implemented and enforced, McCarley said. But he added that one thing is 
certain: The final cost "will have lots of zeros, commas and a dollar sign out 
front . . . it's going to cost a hell of a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Gladstein of the Yes on Big Green committee called the DWP cost estimates 
"crazy" and said they are based on improbable assumptions. "They are taking the 
worst-case scenario," he said. "It's possible utilities will not be affected at 
all," said Gladstein. 
</P>
<P>
After the legislative analyst's initial report was produced in April, the 
city's new Department of Environmental Affairs was ordered to conduct a more 
complete study that is scheduled to be completed by Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Lilian Kawasaki, general manager of the Environmental Affairs Department, said 
she still does not have final figures from several of the most important 
departments, including DWP, Sanitation and Engineering. Other departments, she 
said, expect a minimal impact or found the effects of Big Green too difficult 
to quantify, Kawasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Waters, acting general manager of the DWP, said the final results will not 
be that much different from the April report by the legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's latest analysis "will lower the numbers a little, but they are still 
of the same magnitude," said Waters. "We're still well into the billions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarley agreed that the potential costs would remain high. "I would not expect 
the departments to reduce their numbers," McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
John Stodder, Mayor Tom Bradley's chief aide on environmental matters, 
questioned the accuracy of the high estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Some department's are laying out doomsday scenarios," said Stodder. 
"Department heads are likely to give the worst possible scenario. That's what 
they do with any new regulation," Stodder said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it passes, they'll find a way to make it work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who has become more active on environmental issues in recent months, 
has not yet taken a position on Big Green, while awaiting the Department of 
Environmental Affairs study, Stodder said. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor "is in harmony" with the major provisions of the initiative, 
Stodder said. The City Council is considering a resolution to support the 
measure, but that act is also being delayed by the pending report. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors already is on record in opposition 
to Big Green, as is the Metropolitan Water District and a host of business 
groups including some major utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and is 
supported by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, the Sierra Club, the Natural 
Resources Defense Council and many other politicians and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green is a comprehensive measure that would attempt to regulate pollution, 
toxic emissions, water quality and ensure preservation of natural resources. It 
also would control use of pesticides on food crops and establish an office of a 
state environmental advocate. The measure would ban use of known cancer-causing 
chemicals and require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cost to the DWP is for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from 
power plants. Those fumes are believed to contribute to global warming and 
other environmental damage. To reduce emissions, many of the DWP's power plants 
would have to be retrofitted to burn cleaner fuels and capture more pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Stodder, of the mayor's office, said the impact of the measure would depend on 
"how it is implemented, how it is interpreted, and it depends on how it is 
enforced." 
</P>
<P>
And, Stodder said, if Big Green does not pass, there will still be new costs 
for environmental cleanups that are expected to be ordered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Big Green may be mandated anyway," said Stodder. 
</P>
<P>
But Waters, of the DWP, said that his department's analysis factors out the 
overlapping regulations. The multibillion-dollar price tag the DWP is placing 
on Big Green is exclusive of any other requirements, he said.

BUTTE'S 'FISCAL CANCER' AFFLICTS OTHER COUNTIES 
</P>

<P>
As Butte County struggled through Friday on the brink of bankruptcy, state and 
local officials elsewhere warned that the county's threatened financial 
collapse is symptomatic of money problems facing counties throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Butte is just at the head of the line. At least a half-dozen other counties 
are just a step behind, with more behind them," said Assemblyman Stan Statham 
(R-Oak Run), who represents the county in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A new report by the County Supervisors Assn. of California, obtained Friday by 
The Times, identifies at least 18 California counties that it said were in 
various stages of financial distress. Of those studied, San Diego and Ventura 
were said to be the Southern California counties facing the biggest financial 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The report said, "The fiscal cancer that afflicts Butte County is present to 
some extent in all California counties." The report warned that "the gradual 
fiscal collapse of county government, given its present fiscal structure, is 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as most experts see it, is that the state and the courts are 
requiring counties to provide more health, welfare and other services than 
local tax bases -- or the governor and Legislature -- can support. 
</P>
<P>
Most deeply hurt are counties that had low tax rates when Proposition 13 was 
passed and have been unable to raise taxes to keep pace with rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
One such county, San Diego, "parallels Butte County in an alarming number of 
instances," the report said. The county has lost $76 million in tax revenue 
over the last five years because of cities incorporating or annexing county 
territory. Over the last five years, as taxes and fees were rising 66.8%, the 
report said, the cost of state-required programs was rising 90.5%. During the 
same period, San Diego County's welfare costs rose 284%. 
</P>
<P>
And while Ventura County now is relatively healthy compared to other counties, 
"there are storm clouds on the horizon," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It cited a budget analysis done at the beginning of the year projecting that 
spending will exceed tax revenues by almost $6 million in 1991-92 and $18 
million by 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
As for the more immediate problem facing Butte County, a once-sleepy farming 
region in the Sacramento Valley that is experiencing growing pains, officials 
said Friday that they would delay a decision on whether to become the first 
California county to file for bankruptcy, hoping to work out a bailout plan 
with Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian on Thursday rejected a $15-million financial aid package approved by 
the Legislature and offered his own scaled-down plan. County officials said the 
Deukmejian package would not be enough to keep the county afloat. But, after 
considering filing for bankruptcy Friday, county officials decided to try to 
work something out with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Emmett Pogue, deputy county administrative officer, said, "Bankruptcy is a 
last-resort-type step. There still are other doors open. So long as there are, 
we do not want to go through that last door." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in a letter to Ed McLaughlin, chairman of the Butte County Board of 
Supervisors, seemed to suggest that the county could weather the crisis with a 
bit of state financial aid and some belt-tightening. He did not address broader 
themes that county officials say are at the heart of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Among Deukmejian's suggestions were that the county forgo the purchase of a new 
fire engine to save $300,000, reduce the amount budgeted for county pay raises 
and leave unfilled all but 45 of the 183 new positions it hoped to create. 
Deukmejian, in addition, offered the county a grant of $700,000 and promised to 
waive or defer $5.1 million in obligations to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Statham, who carried the $15-million county aid plan in the Legislature, said 
he was so enraged by Deukmejian's response that he hoped the county would 
immediately file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
He called the governor's proposal "ridiculously inadequate," declaring that the 
benefits were mostly "funny money" in the form of letting Butte County off the 
hook from state obligations that it couldn't meet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor is basically hanging Butte County out to dry. It is outrageous 
that he cannot find a few million in the $55-billion state budget to stop a 
California county from going belly up," Statham said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian defended the plan after a speech to business leaders in Sacramento, 
telling reporters that it was "a responsible, good-faith proposal . . . 
recognizing that there's just so much that we can do for Butte County." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and experts who have studied county problems statewide say 
many of Butte County's problems are showing up in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Sparks, a consultant to the Assembly's Local Government Committee, 
acknowledged that Butte reached the point of bankruptcy faster than other 
counties. But, she said, "the same problems are there in other counties. They 
tend to show up first in a rural county because the tax base is smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is Proposition 13, which requires public votes on tax 
increases, rather than votes by local boards of supervisors as before 1978, 
county officials say. Butte County officials asked local voters in the June 
primary to approve four different taxes to finance the Fire Department, 
libraries and other services. Voters rejected them all. 
</P>
<P>
Also feeding the problem are state requirements that counties administer and 
partially pay for welfare programs. Costs of these programs are soaring. 
According to the county supervisors association report, some counties spend as 
much as 70% of their general-purpose tax dollars on state-required programs, 
leaving only 30% to support local programs, such as law enforcement, fire 
protection and public works. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, county officials say rural counties like Butte, where living costs 
are much lower than in the big cities, are a magnet for welfare recipients 
because people can stretch their grants much further. According to the report, 
the costs to Butte County for administering the Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children program rose 322% during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
At an Oroville mini-mart Friday, clerk Sue Thompson complained to a reporter: 
"We have to pay out too much money for state programs and there are a lot of 
people here on welfare. We've had people move here from Oregon just because of 
the welfare."

MAN HELPS WIFE IN SUICIDE, NOW FACES MURDER CHARGE;

MERCY DEATH: CALIFORNIANS THOUGHT MICHIGAN LAW WAS LENIENT. THEY PICKED WRONG

<P>
Bertram R. Harper says his wife died Aug. 19 exactly the way she wanted, in a 
motel room, with her husband and daughter holding her hands, comforting her and 
in a state where she believed they wouldn't be prosecuted for their assistance 
in her death. 
</P>
<P>
After she had stopped breathing that stormy night, Harper, 72, called the 
police. He and his stepdaughter told them exactly what happened -- how they had 
come from Loomis, Calif., near Sacramento; how Virginia Harper, 69, suffering 
from advanced cancer, had taken sleeping pills and how he had assisted her in 
slipping a plastic bag over her head. 
</P>
<P>
When the first few attempts failed, he told them, he'd waited until she had 
fallen asleep and then put the bag on her himself. He secured it around her 
neck with rubber bands. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect problems," said Harper, a retired chemical engineer. "We 
wanted to come here, my wife wanted to have a suicide very quietly and with no 
notoriety and that would be the end of it." His voice cracks when he speaks of 
it. "That's why we came to Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Harper was charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hara wanted to send a message, two months after 
a Michigan doctor, Jack Kevorkian, had made headlines by using his so-called 
"suicide machine" to help an Oregon woman die: The state is no mecca for mercy 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian has not been charged in Oakland County, where his actions took place, 
but Harper was put in jail. After a week behind bars, a California bail 
bondsman posted the $25,000 bail and won his release. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for people to know," the prosecutor said in a statement after 
murder charges were filed and while Harper was incarcerated, "that Michigan is 
not a state where people can assist in suicides, commit euthanasia or murder 
and escape criminal responsibility for their acts." 
</P>
<P>
Now Harper, fighting to stay out of prison, is becoming a cause celebre and a 
symbol to the growing and increasingly vocal pro-euthanasia movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's tragic," said Derek Humphry, national director of the Hemlock 
Society, an organization that supports euthanasia and to which Harper belongs. 
The organization is helping to pay for Harper's attorney and has created a 
defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like innocents abroad," Humphry said of the family. "These are 
good, decent people, going all that way to keep from getting into trouble and 
then getting into more trouble than they imagined." 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing Friday, a district judge ruled that there is sufficient evidence 
for Harper to stand trial on charges of open murder -- which may be defined at 
trial as first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter -- and of conspiring 
with his stepdaughter to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
His stepdaughter, Shanda McGrew, who was in the motel room and who has stood by 
Harper's side since then, is not being charged. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any jury is going to convict this man of anything," Harper's 
attorney, Hugh M. Davis, said after the hearing. "This is a case of love and 
death, and which will prevail. We believe love will." 
</P>
<P>
The Harpers traveled to Michigan because of a paragraph in one of Humphry's 
books that mentions a 1983 case in which the Michigan Court of Appeals threw 
out murder charges against a man who had obtained a gun and ammunition and left 
them with a depressed friend who shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that because the Legislature had not defined aiding suicide as 
a crime, the man's actions could not be classified as homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avoid prosecution, Harper on Aug. 18 bought plane tickets to Detroit. 
It was two weeks after Virginia had been told by her doctor that she had 
terminal cancer and one day after she had awakened one morning in excruciating 
pain and said she was ready to end it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been married 23 years and this is something we'd discussed over the 
years," Harper said. "It wasn't necessarily like a suicide pact or anything 
like that, but we both considered the quality of life the essential thing, not 
how long you lived." 
</P>
<P>
The couple had friends who had died very painful, lingering deaths, Harper 
said. "We've seen people die deaths that you wouldn't put a dog through," he 
said. "If you did, you'd land in jail." 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that they'd each rather commit suicide than face painful deaths. 
</P>
<P>
They joined the Hemlock Society in the mid-1980s, sometime after Virginia first 
discovered she had breast cancer in 1983. The lump was removed. Then, in 1989, 
another tumor was discovered. It, too, was removed. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until early August that she discovered the cancer had spread to her 
liver. The doctor gave her from "two months to two years" to live, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when his wife began getting her affairs in order and when he began 
preparing himself emotionally to help, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Prosecutor Tim Kenny argued Friday, however, that Harper did more 
than aid in his wife's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence has indicated that Mr. Harper was motivated by love for his wife 
and was concerned and moved by his wife's suffering," he said. But, noting a 
coroner's ruling that Virginia Harper died of asphyxiation caused by the 
plastic bag and not from an overdose of sleeping pills, Kenny said: "This is in 
fact a mercy killing." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging what he called "on-going and increasingly loud societal concerns" 
about euthanasia, Kenny argued that until the Legislature passes a law allowing 
mercy killing, the government has no choice but to prosecute it. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-euthanasia initiatives are being advanced in four states -- Washington, 
California, Florida and Oregon, Humphry said. Farthest along is Washington. A 
spokesman for Washington Citizens for Death with Decency, said 145,700 
signatures have been gathered on petitions. Only 150,000 are needed to put the 
issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly certain that in Washington in November of 1991 there will be the 
first ever vote on euthanasia," Humphry said by telephone from his office in 
Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The Hemlock Society director estimated that "many hundreds" of terminally ill 
people have used the methods described in his books to kill themselves. This is 
the first time to his knowledge, however, that anyone has gone to Michigan to 
do it to escape prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Harpers had contacted him first, he said, he would have advised them 
against it. Both Virginia's death and the legal aftermath would have gone more 
smoothly in the calmness of her own home and in a community where the family is 
known, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis argued unsuccessfully Friday that the harshest charge Harper should face 
is voluntary manslaughter, which carries a possible sentence of 15 years. The 
judge refused to reduce the charge, however, leaving the issue for a circuit 
court to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The second count against Harper, conspiracy to commit murder, carries a 
mandatory life sentence, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said that once before his wife attempted suicide alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened very suddenly while I was away," he told authorities in a 
statement. "I came home and there was a message from a friend to meet Ginger at 
a Holiday Inn in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
When he inquired about her at the front desk, he was told that she had rented a 
room. He found the key in the door, he said. When he entered, he said in an 
interview, he found her sitting on the floor, slumped against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
She had taken sleeping pills, and they had taken effect before she could put 
the plastic bag in place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She resolved after that never to attempt it again without her family near, 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Harper's eyes light up remembering her, and he can laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Not remembering the last part. Remembering her. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in a lawyer's office, with her gone and him in a mess of trouble -- more 
trouble than either of them had bargained for -- Harper's belly shakes and his 
eyes twinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia can still make him laugh. 
</P>
<P>
She was irrepressible. How else to say it? 
</P>
<P>
Harper was wearing a shirt Virginia had made for him, a beige and brown nature 
print that matches one of her outfits. She would do that, have shirts made from 
the material left over from the dresses she sewed. The two of them would walk 
around in matching outfits. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Ginger's way of saying I belonged to her," said Harper. 
</P>
<P>
She liked bright colors. In 1967, when they were married, she owned a 
chartreuse '56 T-bird with floral interior. That was the kind of person she 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Both had been married previously. They met through a personal ad she ran in 
Fact magazine, a national publication, in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very daring of her to do that," McGrew said of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
A long-distance relationship developed over the years. Shortly before they were 
married in 1967, Harper flew from Vermont to Denver on a business trip and 
decided to detour to California to pay her a visit. It was his birthday, and, 
"somewhere over Kansas," he was startled to see a flight attendant, who had 
been tipped off by Virginia, walking toward down the aisle with a birthday cake 
with candles. 
</P>
<P>
He laughs now thinking about it.

TITAN BOOSTER FALLS, BURSTS INTO FLAMES;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A section of a Titan 4 rocket booster fell off a crane and burst into flames 
Friday at a testing laboratory here, leaving one worker missing and presumed 
dead, injuring nine others and sending a mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke 
thousands of feet into the air, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby test areas on this sprawling Mojave desert base were evacuated, a 
portion of a state highway was shut temporarily and Air Force firefighters and 
"disaster-response teams" battled for an hour to extinguish the blaze at the 
hilltop laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a giant ball of fire with pure white smoke going up into a mushroom," 
said Jack Tiger, a sales representative for a Palmdale company that supplies 
heavy equipment to the test site, a laboratory that has figured prominently in 
the development of the nation's rocketry for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, the largest unmanned space booster being developed by the Air 
Force, is designed to carry almost as much payload into orbit as the space 
shuttle and was intended to free the military from its dependency on the 
troubled shuttle program. But the Titan program, which costs $200 million per 
launch, is over budget and behind schedule and also has been plagued with 
malfunctions and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
After the fire broke out, hospitals throughout the Antelope Valley were put on 
alert to prepare for patients from the base, but the casualty toll by late 
Friday held at nine injured, including one who suffered chemical burns and 
another whose elbow was fractured. Five workers were treated for smoke 
inhalation and released. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the victims were not disclosed, but officials said three were believed 
to be civilian workers employed by an aerospace contractor. 
</P>
<P>
One worker was still missing late Friday. Lt. Col. Jan Dalby said the base's 
disaster response team was searching for him. But, he added, "We assume that he 
is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Some damage to surrounding buildings was also reported. The intense fire curled 
the metal siding on some structures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:45 a.m. as the rocket booster was being moved at 
the base's Astronautics Laboratory. It forced several hundred employees to be 
evacuated from the facility, a 65-square-mile complex north of the base's Test 
Flight Center and known as "The Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Mechanics said sections of the 112-foot rocket booster were being moved to an 
outdoor test stand where they would be further assembled. The procedure, called 
"stacking," involves attaching the first and second stages to the bottom, 
largest section. 
</P>
<P>
As the bottom section of one solid-fuel booster was being hoisted to the stand 
by a 900-ton crane, it became dislodged and fell 100 feet, igniting upon 
impact, Air Force Maj. Dick Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The piece that fell and caught on fire is the motor unit section of a Titan 
Advanced Solid Rocket booster, Air Force spokesmen said. Two such solid-fuel 
boosters are strapped to the sides of the middle section, or "core vehicle," of 
a Titan 4 rocket and used to give the rocket initial liftoff. The liquid-fueled 
core vehicle, which carries the payload, then fires shortly after the boosters 
separate. 
</P>
<P>
The segment that toppled from the crane was being tested to determine whether 
the Air Force wanted to purchase additional units, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The crane, which stood more than 100 feet tall and could be seen for miles 
around, fell onto concrete blocks at the test stand. Air Force officials said 
the missing worker may be buried under the rubble, complicating recovery of the 
body.

"All I could see was that the crane fell over and a bunch of smoke went up," 
said David Calta, a civil engineer who works at the Astronautics Laboratory. 
"(The crane) was like the landmark around here. It's visible from quite a 
distance and now it's not there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials emphasized the booster component did not explode but 
produced a sudden, large "flash fire." 
</P>
<P>
"It looked much like fireworks from the Fourth of July when you have a 
sparkler," Ranney Adams, a spokesman for the Astronautics Laboratory, said. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting accounts from witnesses, some of whom reported hearing a 
blast and others who did not. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a small boom and the next thing I know they were telling us to get 
out," said a mechanic working at the base who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"The security police said, 'Ladies and gentlemen get off The Rock. Now!' " 
</P>
<P>
The mechanic said there was a massive tie-up of cars leaving the base, and at 
least five ambulances passed him, going toward the lab. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cloud of smoke, which billowed several thousand feet into the air, 
contained trace amounts of potentially toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric 
acid, Air Force officials said it at no time posed a threat to surrounding 
communities in the sparsely populated desert area. It wafted northward, then 
dissipated, but could be seen up to 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
No nuclear-delivery system was involved in the accident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As the cloud drifted, the California Highway Patrol closed a 30-mile stretch of 
California 58 as a precaution. The road was opened about 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a thunderhead, a big plume of smoke curling into the air," said 
a mechanic who works in a nearby laboratory. "Oh jeez, it was a half-mile in 
diameter. I have never seen anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
He added that workers were alerted to the emergency by an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard any noise or explosion," he said. "I was in another building. 
They came over the alert system saying, 'We have a major emergency, all haz mat 
(hazardous material) and rescue teams go to your posts. This is not a drill. We 
have an emergency on hand.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two inspectors from Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency, arrived at the test 
site Friday afternoon. Officials from the Air Force Space Division, which 
oversees the Astronautics Laboratory, were also expected to join an 
investigation of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) also urged the Pentagon to investigate, saying the 
accident may have exposed "unknown deficiencies in Air Force procedures for 
moving, storing and installing" Titan 4 components. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, located in the western Mojave Desert about 100 miles north of Los 
Angeles, is home of the Air Force Flight Test Center, the country's premier 
aerospace test and research facility. Nearly every aircraft in the Air Force 
inventory over the last 45 years has been tested and evaluated by the Air Force 
Flight Test Center, which is 17 miles south of the Astronautics Laboratory 
where Friday's accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The Astronautics Laboratory, the largest tenant at Edwards, represents the 
space and missile arm of the Air Force. With a 1989 budget of $137 million, it 
is charged with conducting advanced research and development involving space 
systems and rocket propulsion technologies, including solid propellant rocket 
motors. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4 is the newest and largest unmanned space booster being developed by 
Air Force Systems Command's Space Division. Built by the Martin Marietta Corp., 
it is designed to carry payloads equivalent in size and weight to those carried 
by the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Past Titan rockets have carried spy payloads. The first was launched on June 
14, 1989, boosting what analysts said was either a missile-warning satellite or 
an electronic eavesdropping satellite. The second Titan 4, worth $173 million, 
was launched June 8 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., carrying a secret surveillance 
satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Ten launches were planned during 1990-91, but six were postponed because of 
delays in preparing launch sites and taking delivery of the rockets. As of 
June, the Air Force said it planned two more Titan 4 launches this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 Titan 4s annually by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force initially planned to build only 10 Titan 4s to complement the 
space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads. But the 1986 explosion that 
destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed seven crew members prompted the 
Pentagon to decide to obtain many more. 
</P>
<P>
Two Titan 34D rockets, the immediate predecessor to the Titan 4, failed during 
launch attempts at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1985 and '86. Also in 1986, a 
Titan 34D exploded at Vandenberg, injuring 58 people.

FACTS ABOUT THE TITAN $ ROCKET 
</P>
<P>
A Titan 4 rocket booster fell and burned at a testing laboratory at Edwards Air 
Force Base. The accident occured at 10:45 a.m. on Friday as the rocket was 
being moved at the base's Astronautics Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Dimensions: Consists of a two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket that is about 200 
feet tall, plus 112-foot-tall, stap-on, solid-fueled booster rockets. The 
boosters are 10 feet in diameter and weigh 771,000 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Launch cost: Approximately $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Payload: Can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit or a 10,000-pound 
payload to a fixed orbit 22,300 miles high. By comparison, the space shuttle 
can put a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Contractor: Martin Marietta was awarded the $7.3-billion Air Force contract to 
build 41 Titan 4s. 
</P>
<P>
Engines: Two solid-propellant rockets (boosters) made by Martin Marietta. Two 
liqid-fueled main engines plus an upper stage Centaur rocket, made by General 
Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel: Hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants for the solid rocket 
boosters and liquid oxygen/hydrogen for the liquid rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Launch sites: There are four Titan pads, two at Vandenberg Air Force Base and 
two in Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Potential launch capability: Up to 20 per year.

CONGRESS: WHITE HOUSE NEGOTIATORS AND LAWMAKERS HUDDLE IN SECLUSION AT A 
MILITARY BASE. POLITICAL SQUABBLES MARK THE START OF THE TALKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Budget talks between the White House and Congress resumed Friday with 
negotiators vowing that the rapidly escalating costs of the Persian Gulf 
military buildup will not prevent them from completing work on a $50-billion 
package of spending cuts and tax increases by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't changed our focus or objectives," President Bush declared as he 
arrived at Andrews Air Force Base for a 30-minute visit with lawmakers. 
"Nothing has transpired anywhere that makes me less interested in getting a 
budget agreement that gets this deficit under control once and for all." 
</P>
<P>
But the opening session, convened in the isolated and relatively Spartan 
atmosphere of a military base 10 miles from Capitol Hill in order to escape the 
scrutiny of reporters and lobbyists, was marked by the usual petty and 
not-so-petty squabbles among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, for example, complained that their private discussion area just 
outside the officers' bar where the group is meeting is smaller than the 
section set aside for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
More seriously, both sides discreetly leaked attacks on each other's plans, 
with Democrats criticizing Republicans for trying to dodge higher taxes on the 
rich while GOP lawmakers aimed barbs at Democrats for wanting to slash Pentagon 
spending in the face of the crisis in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to have the kind of defense meltdown that some had sought," 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) told reporters. "There are still mean people in the 
world, and, even in an era when the lion and the lamb are about to lie down 
together, it's important that the United States of America be the lion." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the predictable responses, Democrats and Republicans finally were 
talking to each other about substantive proposals after three months of 
meetings earlier this year and a five-week break for Congress' summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
But, with time running out to avoid more than $100 billion in automatic 
spending cuts scheduled for Oct. 1, it was still unclear whether negotiators 
could bridge the large gap that divides them. Bargainers are aiming to complete 
work by Monday to allow Congress time to write the plan into law. 
</P>
<P>
With next year's federal deficit now likely to reach $250 billion, negotiators 
hope to develop a deficit-reduction package this weekend that will persuade the 
Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and provide lawmakers with a legitimate 
excuse to throw out next year's clearly unreachable deficit target of $64 
billion. The target is mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers, however, consider the Administration's threat to impose 
Gramm-Rudman cuts of almost 40% on a wide variety of defense and domestic 
programs a paper tiger because of the unacceptable damage it would inflict on 
the Pentagon during its buildup for possible war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In developing their budget package, negotiators hinted that they plan to ignore 
for now most of the added costs of the Middle East conflict, estimated to be 
running at $1.5 billion a month. At the same time, they welcomed the news that 
Saudi Arabia, the exiled government of Kuwait and a handful of other nations 
would contribute funds to help defray the costs of the U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
The $53-billion Republican package, largely based on a White House plan that 
was disclosed several weeks ago, calls for higher taxes on wine and beer and 
substantial cuts in Medicare and other federal benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
The roughly $50-billion Democratic proposal, finally pulled together late 
Thursday night, aims to impose higher taxes on those earning more than $200,000 
a year, calls for stiffer levies on smoking and liquor and hits defense 
spending much harder than domestic programs. It would raise taxes by almost $27 
billion and slash defense spending by almost $15 billion, while limiting 
benefit cuts to about $6 billion.

With Gov. Michael S. Dukakis out of the state, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy issued a 
series of executive orders on Friday to cut state spending in the face of 
failing revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, a gubernatorial candidate who appears to be losing ground to her two 
Democratic primary opponents, said she would not try to take disciplinary 
action against agency heads who do not comply with the orders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do anything silly," she said at a news conference. "I 
understand the limits of my authority right now." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that Dukakis could rescind the orders when he returns next 
week from a trade mission to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy called for a 25% cut in middle-level management personnel by Dec. 31, 
implementation of an early retirement incentive program and a temporary payroll 
reduction for those making more than $40,000, which includes the governor and 
lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
She called also for monthly reporting of state spending and state revenue 
collections and quarterly audits by a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
The measures would save from $125 million to $150 million, she said, about the 
same level of cuts ordered Tuesday by Dukakis. But Murphy claimed that her cuts 
would be limited exclusively to middle management and would not affect direct 
services.

PARLIAMENT BACKS THATCHER ON GULF

<P>
Britain's Parliament on Friday strongly backed Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's dispatch of forces to the Persian Gulf and her refusal to rule out 
military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day emergency debate, the House of Commons supported 
government policy by a vote of 437 to 35, far higher than the 100-seat majority 
Thatcher's Conservatives normally command in the 650-member chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Britain was the first country to commit forces to back the U.S. military 
buildup in the gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has sent three squadrons of fighter-bomber aircraft, a destroyer and 
two frigates to the area. A second destroyer and three minesweepers are also on 
their way. Officials said a further commitment would almost certainly be ground 
troops.

7,000 SOVIETS REPORTED ON IRAQI PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the continued presence of 193 Soviet military advisers in Iraq has drawn 
harsh criticism from Congress, far more crucial services actually are being 
provided by about 7,000 Soviet civilians who are still at work on projects 
vital to Baghdad's economy, U.S. experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Soviet Union and the Bush Administration have sought to play down the 
importance of the advisers, stressing instead the areas in which Moscow has 
cooperated with the international effort against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
However, the work being performed by the civilian experts and technicians -- at 
work on such crucial Iraqi projects as a 40,000-ton grain elevator, a major 
irrigation system and a giant power station -- will have a direct effect on 
Iraq's ability to withstand the international embargo that is the centerpiece 
of Washington's long-term strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are important because this is key infrastructure. You can shut the 
power down by getting these guys out. They are much more important, in my mind, 
than the military guys," says Ilana Kass, a Soviet specialist at the Pentagon's 
National War College. 
</P>
<P>
Though the issue of the private advisers has received little attention, it 
could become an important one at this weekend's Helsinki summit. It is a 
difficult line for President Bush to walk: Pushing too hard on the issue might 
undermine Soviet cooperation in other areas, but allowing the Soviet advisers 
to remain in Iraq could weaken the grip of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article in a major Russian Republic newspaper, Sovetskaya Rossiya, 
Soviet officials provided details of the projects that they had undertaken in 
Iraq and acknowledged that by withdrawing the civilian advisers, they could do 
"definite damage to the Iraqi economy." 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be easy (for Baghdad) to make up the losses," according to the 
newspaper report, which included an interview with K. F. Katushez, the Soviet 
minister of foreign economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1959, the newspaper said, the Soviet Union has provided technical 
assistance on at least 100 Iraqi construction projects, more than 80 of which 
are now fully operating. The most important work still in progress includes a 
1,680-megawatt heat and electrical power station, the grain elevator in the 
city of Sulaymaniyah, drilling in the western Qurnah oil field, construction of 
a major irrigation system and planning and survey work for a major 
hydroelectric power complex on the Euphrates River. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Iraq has invested a sizable share of its oil revenues in economic 
development. As part of its strategy, it has paid handsomely for the expertise 
of the developed world. Many of the Westerners now being detained in Iraq were 
technicians who had moved there to provide just that type of know-how. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other Arab countries, however, the Iraqis also made a determined -- 
and largely successful -- effort to learn for themselves how to operate the 
advanced equipment that they purchased, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are above average, and far ahead of the Saudis, who couldn't draw cold 
water from the tap" without Western expertise, said one foreign-policy 
specialist, speaking on the condition that she not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the services being provided by the Soviet civilian advisers are among the 
few areas of vulnerability that the United States can target. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not many analysts believe that Iraq is likely to be brought to its knees 
simply because it does not have access to spare parts or to foreign 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Although Western intelligence-gathering agencies are getting occasional reports 
that "the system's beginning to fray and wear and break here and there," Iraq 
is not experiencing major disruptions, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've demonstrated a remarkable ability to innovate their own kind of 
jury-rigged technology in things that we would not necessarily have expected 
them to do, and they have done it by themselves," the source added. "They may 
have done it with technical equipment from the West, but they essentially did 
many of the things themselves, so I wouldn't underestimate them." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Freedenberg, who was undersecretary of commerce for export administration 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration, noted that Iraq is not a 
technologically complex society by Western standards. Therefore, he said, the 
loss of trained foreign technicians does not mean "that the place is going to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Freedenberg also noted that other nations have demonstrated that it is possible 
to adapt to a loss of technical expertise. Most Western technicians left Iran 
during the turmoil of the late 1970s and early 1980s, he said, and Iranians 
simply learned to put up with a power blackout or two each day. They would even 
carry flashlights to restaurants so that they could dine without interruption.

SHIITE PRISONERS NOW REPORTED IN IRAN'S HANDS

Most of the 15 Shiite Muslims imprisoned in Kuwait on terrorism charges and 
whose fate was linked to that of two U.S. hostages held in Lebanon have been 
handed over to Iran following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a Lebanese magazine 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine Ash Shiraa, which broke the Iran-Contra scandal, said most of the 
15 Shiites, members of the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, are now in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them are Iraqi Shiites. (There originally were 17, but two of the 
prisoners were released last year, having served their sentences.) They were 
serving different sentences for attempting to bomb the U.S. and French 
embassies and Kuwait's oil refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Imprisonment of the 15 is widely cited as one of the factors triggering a wave 
of abductions of Westerners in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad, a radical group that claimed responsibility for kidnaping U.S. 
citizens Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, had demanded the release of the 
15 prisoners in exchange for freeing the two U.S. captives. The government of 
Kuwait had rejected these conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ash Shiraa said some of the 15 escaped on the first day of Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, and one showed up in his native Lebanese village of Yattir, 10 miles 
south of Beirut. The remaining 14 were handed over to Iran by Iraq, the 
magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that when the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait, it seized the 
prisoners.

FIRST SHIP FROM KUWAIT FERRIES OUT 700 INDIANS;

REFUGEES: THE VOYAGE TO EMIRATES WAS DIFFICULT. ANOTHER FERRY DOCKS THERE WITH

More than 700 Indians arrived here Friday on board the first ship to leave 
Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The exhausted refugees made the three-day voyage with little to eat except 
bread and tuna fish. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hot, oily water to drink," said a young man named Rajiv, an engineering 
student from New York who was visiting Kuwait when the Iraqis struck on Aug. 2. 
"But we are safe now." 
</P>
<P>
Sweat streamed down his face, and his eyes were bloodshot from the sun and lack 
of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees arrived at Port Rashid on the freighter Safeer, which had docked 
in Kuwait before the invasion. Its Indian owner, Ibrahim Modak, told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of leaving empty-handed from a place which was brimming over with 
foreigners, we decided the risk was well worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi military authorities reportedly raised no objections to the Safeer's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
There were more than 170,000 Indians in Kuwait, the largest non-Arab expatriate 
community there. Modak said he gave preference to students and visitors, "and 
those who could leave on very short notice." From here, the refugees will be 
flown home on Air India charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
Many Indians in Kuwait had crowded into the Indian Embassy compound, and those 
who arrived here said conditions were worsening. 
</P>
<P>
"Drivers, laborers, construction workers and domestic helpers who had nowhere 
to go were pouring in with the hope of shelter," said Jagat Reddy, a shipping 
company employee. "The whole place is filthy and slushy. It stinks, and there 
is little more than dry bread to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee said water supplies were drying up in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"Tankers used to come to supply us with water daily at the rate of 10 Kuwaiti 
dinars a month," he noted. "Now we are paying five a week, and the tankers have 
started coming once every three days." 
</P>
<P>
An Indian banker among the refugees said Asian communities in Kuwait had about 
a two weeks' supply of food. Noting the importance to the Indian economy of the 
workers abroad, he added: 
</P>
<P>
"If rescue operations by the Indian government are not arranged swiftly, a very 
important source of its foreign-exchange reserves will be starved to death." 
</P>
<P>
The ship reached Dubai's waters Thursday night but was held offshore until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tipu Sultan, a Bombay oceangoing ferry, arrived in Dubai 
carrying 10,000 tons of food that the New Delhi government had planned to 
deliver to Kuwait in return for more Indian refugees. The government said U.N. 
officials had prohibited the ferry from delivering its cargo because of the 
economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, the Indian government acknowledged that Iraq has refused to allow 
thousands of Indians to leave Iraq and Kuwait unless the ships and planes sent 
to take them home arrive with cargoes of food. 
</P>
<P>
For days the government had denied reports that restrictions had been placed on 
the evacuation of Indian nationals, but External Affairs Minister Inder Gujral, 
speaking to Parliament, confirmed them Friday.

U.S. INVITES SOVIETS TO SEND TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST IN A POLICY REVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States formally dropped its longstanding objection to a Soviet 
military presence in the Middle East on Friday as President Bush departed for a 
one-day superpower meeting in Finland designed to put forth a common front 
against the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing decades of U.S. policy, a senior Administration official declared in 
a pre-summit briefing that it would be "useful" for the Soviet Union to 
contribute ground troops to the multinational force now arrayed against Iraq in 
the Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
The invitation to Moscow to dispatch military forces to a region in which the 
United States has long sought to hold it at bay marked a dramatic step forward 
in a U.S.-Soviet partnership that has evolved rapidly since the Persian Gulf 
crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication, however, that the Soviet Union would send 
troops, and the Administration stopped short of acceding to a Soviet request 
that the troops in the region be subject to a central United Nations command. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. appeal for joint action came as a newly arranged airlift of Americans 
from Kuwait opened a route to freedom for hundreds of U.S. citizens who have 
spent weeks in hiding, with the first planeload of evacuees scheduled to arrive 
in the United States this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. officials searched for a way to maintain a comprehensive 
quarantine against Iraq in the face of mounting pressure from other countries 
to open the way for food supplies as shortages there begin to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
A ranking U.S. official said the Administration feared that a crack in the 
sanctions could "set the clock back by months" by easing the economic squeeze 
on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. He conceded, however, that the United States 
has found itself in an increasingly "uncomfortable position" in appearing to 
use "food as a weapon of war." 
</P>
<P>
The new Administration statement on Soviet ground troops appeared to be part of 
a larger strategy to use the Sunday session in Helsinki to present a picture of 
superpower unity against Iraq and send what the senior official called "a very 
helpful signal" to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials had hinted previously that the United States might welcome 
a Soviet military contribution to the anti-Iraq coalition, but the unequivocal 
statement at the briefing Friday elevated to official policy the U.S. 
willingness to accept a Soviet army contingent in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Administration official, who spoke to reporters on condition of 
anonymity, said the presence of Soviet ground troops would underline the 
multilateral character of the forces against Iraq "by adding representation 
from one of the major powers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Bush would urge Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to provide 
ground troops, the official said only that such a gesture would be "useful" and 
would make the Administration "very happy." But he said the step was not 
"essential." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has sought since World War II to block any Soviet military 
presence in the Middle East, and refused as recently as 1987 to permit the 
Soviet Union to participate in an operation designed to safeguard Kuwaiti oil 
tanker shipments threatened by the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the turnabout, the senior Administration official asserted that 
Moscow had demonstrated a "fairly impressive departure" from traditional Soviet 
policy challenging U.S. interests in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed fairly dramatically," the official said, noting that the 
Soviets had made clear their opposition to the Iraqi invasion. "I think a 
cooperative approach is warranted." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the Administration gave no indication of a 
willingness to consider proposals by the Soviets and others to organize the 
anti-Iraq military effort under a United Nations flag -- creating the kind of 
multinational army not seen since the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to learn to walk on these kind of cooperative ventures before we can 
run," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
And U.S. officials also made clear their continued pique at the presence in 
Iraq of 193 Soviet military advisers who, in an anomaly left over from Moscow's 
past policies, continue to provide assistance to the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration previously had given wide berth to the question of indirect 
Soviet aid, suggesting that the advisers might not be free to leave. But the 
senior Administration official said bluntly Friday that "you can be sure that 
that issue will be discussed" at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the first airlift of 165 Americans from Kuwait arrived in Amman, 
Jordan, the State Department expressed hope that a succession of flights in 
coming days could bring hundreds of U.S. citizens to safety. 
</P>
<P>
A second flight of similar size was scheduled to make its way from Kuwait city 
through Baghdad to Jordan this morning, and the more than 300 Americans were 
then expected to return to the United States aboard a military plane. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said Iraq had taken the 
initiative to "show the world our goodwill" with release of the Americans, but 
complained that the United States had failed to reciprocate with a similar act 
to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said Friday's evacuation had proceeded 
in a "smooth, orderly fashion" and added that the United States remained 
hopeful that Iraq would eventually permit the departure of "all those who wish 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
But Dillen noted that Iraq had offered exit rights only to women and children, 
and he warned against over-optimism, saying: "The hopes of hundreds of 
thousands of people have been raised and dashed by Iraq's string of 
inconsistent statements and cynical manipulations." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as the airlift began, the State Department said at least one more 
American man had been rounded up in Kuwait and moved to Baghdad, bringing to 
nearly 90 the total of Americans now in Iraqi custody. 
</P>
<P>
The department also complained that Iraq had not yet followed through on its 
promise to provide U.S. officials access to an American man shot and wounded 
Wednesday by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In providing new details about the airlift, U.S. officials confirmed that the 
United States made payments to the Iraqi government to cover charter costs for 
the Iraqi Airways jetliners used in the evacuation. They also indicated that 
the United States was providing spare parts for the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department insisted, however, that the arrangement did not violate 
the embargo against Iraq. In an apparent claim to a humanitarian exemption, it 
said that the flights had "the express purpose" of gaining freedom for 
Americans and others who had been detained as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. officials seeking to blunt international momentum in 
support of food aid for Iraq mounted an effort to persuade other countries that 
shortages had not yet reached a critical point, and that there was no need for 
a relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
The effort at the United Nations came in response to signals that China, Iran 
and India were preparing to begin food shipments, and to divisions within a 
special Security Council committee about whether food aid should be blocked as 
part of the U.N. embargo.

NEGOTIATED SOLUTION URGED BY BAPTISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc., the nation's third-largest 
Protestant denomination, Friday urged the United States to negotiate a 
settlement with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, "no matter how horrific the 
position of Saddam Hussein might appear." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 delegates to the black denomination's annual meeting in Los Angeles 
approved without debate a resolution that reflected the stance of National 
Baptist President T. J. Jemison. 
</P>
<P>
Jemison had said Wednesday that he supports President Bush's deployment of 
troops but does not want American lives lost because of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution also praised one of the denomination's own ministers, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, for his "courageous efforts to get the release of hostages" when 
he met with Iraqi President Hussein in Baghdad late last month.

GORBACHEV, BUSH INVITED TO GERMAN CEREMONIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday invited President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to witness the Cold War's demise at Oct. 3 
ceremonies celebrating German reunification, although Bonn and Moscow are still 
haggling over some details of the historic merger. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl telephoned the two leaders to go over the remaining areas of contention 
and to ask them to take part in the festivities, Hans Klein, a spokesman for 
the Bonn government, said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether both erstwhile adversaries would attend, but the 
ceremonies would provide a welcome backdrop of foreign policy success for the 
presidents, who are currently struggling with other crises. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency ADN reported from Moscow that Gorbachev plans to 
take part and that he hopes to shake Bush's hand at the Brandenburg Gate, near 
the site of the Berlin Wall, which stood for 28 years as a symbol of East-West 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Bush are expected to discuss the invitation at their meeting 
Sunday in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, leaders of the other two victorious powers of World War II, have 
already indicated that they will attend the festivities in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The two Germanys concluded a treaty last week that spells out the specifics of 
their reunion, but an accord on the international aspects remains to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Two-plus-four" talks, involving the two Germanys and the four victorious 
powers, ended Friday without agreement on how much support West Germany should 
provide for the Soviet troop withdrawal from East Germany over the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in East Berlin said they were confident that the last wrinkles could 
be ironed out next week when the foreign ministers of the six nations meet in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been pressing for more financial assistance from Bonn in 
repatriating their 370,000 troops from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The reunited German state will be a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, although the Soviets will not complete their pullout from the 
East German sector until 1994. The fate of the East German People's Army is 
still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Kremlin's concern is with economic questions, such as where to 
house the soldiers and their families and how to integrate the forces into 
domestic defense units. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the withdrawal difficulties, the Soviets have also insisted that 
the final document specifying international terms for reunification must 
include a promise to keep nuclear weapons out of what is now East German 
territory, diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Western allies have reportedly rejected this demand on grounds that such a 
written commitment would infringe on the sovereignty of the new German state.

DE KLERK TO SEE BUSH SEPT. 24; FIRST SUCH VISIT SINCE '48 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President F. W. de Klerk will meet with President Bush in Washington on Sept. 
24, the first U.S. visit by a South African government leader since apartheid 
took effect in 1948, South Africa announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha announced the visit in a statement, 
saying he and De Klerk will take up a longstanding invitation from Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said De Klerk will try to cement a warm relationship already 
established by telephone with Bush and to explain his plans for power-sharing 
with blacks, who outnumber whites by 5 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
They said he will not ask for relief from sweeping economic sanctions imposed 
by the U.S. Congress as a penalty for apartheid, the country's policy of racial 
separation, but will argue that they should be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's international isolation began to thaw early this year when De 
Klerk repudiated 40 years of apartheid and started talks with African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela about a negotiated transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was to have met Bush in June, shortly before Mandela began a 
triumphant American tour, but he canceled when U.S. anti-apartheid groups 
threatened to disrupt his visit. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said De Klerk realizes he will still face protests but believes his 
reform message will be an effective counter to opponents of his visit. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant symbol of De Klerk's break with white Afrikaner tradition 
was his request last week to his own National Party, which has ruled South 
Africa without significant challenge since 1948, to open its doors to blacks.

5 DEAD IN MIDWEST AS STORMS SPAWN FLOODING AND LIGHTNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A band of thunderstorms from Michigan to Pennsylvania unleashed high winds and 
driving rain, flooding Ohio River communities with as much as 10 feet of water 
Friday and disrupting flights from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The storms were blamed for the deaths of five people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents fled their homes in Steubenville, Ohio, and across the 
Ohio River in Follansbee, W. Va., because of the flooding. The North Ohio 
Valley Air Authority reported that 5.71 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in 
Steubenville, where schools were closed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported that floodwaters in Steubenville were as 
high as 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived down here 15 years, and I've never seen anything like this before," 
Jessica Keifer of Steubenville said. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines said it canceled 50% of its Friday afternoon flights out of 
O'Hare. Some southbound flights out of the airport had to be diverted as far 
east as Iowa City before they could start turning south in order to get around 
the storms, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A sailboat caught in the storm Thursday on Lake Erie crashed into a breakwater 
near Cleveland harbor and broke into pieces. Three women aboard were killed, 
and three men were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The boaters were whipped so hard by 36-m.p.h. winds and six-foot waves that 
their clothes had been torn off, Coast Guard Lt. Vincent Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Ohio, a 50-year-old woman was struck by lightning and killed as she 
ran for shelter through a farm field near Wilmot. Another woman died in a 
two-car accident in Warren blamed on a power outage caused by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
The Allegheny Creek in West Virginia ran out of its banks, flooding about a 
dozen businesses with up to six feet of water and submerging cars in 
Follansbee. About 40 homes were evacuated in the town of about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it actually floated cars," Fire Chief Larry Rea said. 
</P>
<P>
In western Pennsylvania, Plum Creek overflowed about 20 miles southwest of 
Pittsburgh, flooding the business district in Houston with up to 10 feet of 
water. One hundred residents of Avella were evacuated, Washington County 
Emergency Services Director Bracken Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Tornadoes knocked down trees in Pennsylvania's Butler County and Westmoreland 
County, the weather service said. Other unconfirmed tornado sightings were 
reported in Michigan and Ohio.

A sniper armed with a rifle and handgun fired several shots from the roof of a 
15-story apartment building Friday, holding police at bay for five hours before 
shooting himself and plunging to the street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was hurt in the incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified as Paul Fisher, wore an orange hunting cap and was 
perched on a rooftop ledge at Moorhead Towers, a high-rise unit for the elderly 
and handicapped on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who was believed to be in his 40s, was a resident of the apartment 
complex. Police said they were not sure what caused the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Mayer DeRoy said Fisher appeared to be despondent, and police 
offered counseling at a hospital with assurances that he would not be 
prosecuted. He surrendered his rifle to policemen about an hour before he 
killed himself, but he refused to relinquish the pistol.

COURT SAYS IT'S TOO EARLY TO RULE ON SURVEILLANCE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that it was premature to 
decide the constitutionality of government surveillance conducted while 
investigating seven Los Angeles-area Palestinians and a Kenyan, whom the 
government has been attempting to deport. 
</P>
<P>
The eight were originally charged with subversion 3 1/2 years ago, and have 
been fighting deportation proceedings in U.S. Immigration Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, two of the defendants face subversion charges, while the others are 
accused of a variety of visa violations. The surveillance was conducted by a 
top-secret unit of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge had declined to hear arguments of the American Civil Liberties 
Union which contended the surveillance was unconstitutional. In a 3-0 opinion, 
the appellate court said, in effect, the deportation proceedings would have to 
be resolved first before it could consider the surveillance issue.

TITAN 4 IS KEY TO AIR FORCE GOALS; 
</P>
<P>
ROCKET: THE POWERFUL LAUNCH VEHICLE IS THE SERVICE'S ANSWER TO NASA'S SPACE 
SHUTTLE. IT TOO HAS SUFFERED MAJOR SETBACKS.

<P>
The Titan 4 booster rocket that erupted in fire at Edwards Air Force Base on 
Friday while being assembled by crane is a key part of the Air Force's answer 
to the space shuttle -- a powerful, unmanned rocket that can launch heavy 
payloads into space. 
</P>
<P>
But the $200-million-a-shot Titan, like its civilian counterpart, has had its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, the latest in a generation of rockets that grew out of the 
intercontinental ballistic missile program, is a "top-of-the-line launch 
vehicle," said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, it is over budget and far behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials have never been comfortable relying on the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch its satellites into orbit -- as 
Congress ordered it to do more than a decade ago as part of an effort to make 
the shuttle "economical" by ensuring an ample supply of customers. After the 
space shuttle Challenger exploded in January, 1986, the Air Force successfully 
renewed its effort to win congressional approval to get back into the launching 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, designed to carry as much payload into orbit as the shuttle, is 
supposed to free the Air Force of its dependence on NASA. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, with the civilian space shuttle fleet grounded because of hydrogen 
fuel leaks, the Air Force was left trying to explain a massive fire that is 
bound to raise the same kind of questions in Washington that NASA has been 
trying to answer about its shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, of course, is not the same sort of problem that has been confronting 
NASA -- which in addition to its shuttle problems has a space telescope that 
doesn't work right -- but the accident once again reveals the vulnerability of 
any space program. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the Titan 4) is our way of lifting heavy payloads for the future," 
Logsdon said. "This is it." 
</P>
<P>
And the Air Force, he added, may be guilty of placing all its eggs in one 
basket, just as NASA did with the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say there has been criticism of the Air Force for placing all its 
eggs in a new basket, called Titan 4," he said. "It owns the Titan 4, whereas 
it didn't own the shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Logsdon noted, problems with that vehicle would leave the Air Force open 
to the same kind of criticism that NASA faces -- placing too much reliance on 
one system. 
</P>
<P>
Although the overall record of the Titan program has been good, with more than 
200 successful launches dating back to 1962, the newer-generation vehicles have 
had their problems. Two Titan 34D rockets -- the Titan 4's immediate 
predecessor -- failed during launch attempts at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
1985 and 1986, the second coming just months after the Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Vandenberg, Titans can also be launched from the Cape Canaveral 
Air Force Station in Florida, just south of the Kennedy Space Center. Both 
sites have seen the launches of Titans in the past, but the Titan 4 represents 
a new stage in the nation's space program. 
</P>
<P>
Rockets are not launched from Edwards because they would have to travel over 
populated areas during their hazardous early ascent. The Titan involved in 
Friday's accident was at the Air Force's Astronautics Laboratory at the 
sprawling base, where it was undergoing tests. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful rocket uses a two-stage, liquid-fueled main propulsion system, 
plus two solid rockets strapped to its sides. The solids give the rocket its 
initial lift off the pad, and the first-stage main engine fires shortly after 
the boosters separate from the rocket. The second stage ignites last, carrying 
the payload either into Earth orbit or, at least potentially, into deep space. 
</P>
<P>
Solid rockets, like the one that caught fire Friday, have been controversial 
since they were introduced in the U.S. space program. Critics argued that once 
a solid is ignited, it cannot be shut down. Supporters argued that solids would 
be the most reliable way of boosting the carrying capacity of large rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel used in the Titan 4 booster, as in all solid-fuel rockets, is highly 
flammable, as Friday's accident demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, a solid rocket is like a firecracker," Logsdon said. "You treat it 
with a great deal of respect." 
</P>
<P>
Once the two solid rockets are ignited, the fuel is supposed to burn for two 
minutes in a controlled fire that generates 1.4 million pounds of thrust. 
</P>
<P>
The solids are blasted free of the main rocket after their fuel has been 
exhausted, and the liquid-fueled engine takes over. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4's capacity is slightly less than the shuttle's. It can put almost 
10,000 pounds into geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth. At that 
altitude the payload orbits at just the right speed to remain stationary over 
one spot on the Earth's surface, an ideal situation for communications 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity varies according to which launching site is used. Any rocket can 
carry a heavier load into space from the Cape than it can from Vandenberg. 
Payloads are launched into equatorial orbit from the Cape, so the rocket 
benefits from the spin of the Earth, which is equivalent to around 1,000 miles 
an hour at the Equator. The effect is similar to that of throwing a rock out 
the window of a moving car. 
</P>
<P>
But payloads are launched into polar orbit from Vandenberg, and that slingshot 
effect is lost, so the weight of the load must be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY OF TITAN ACCIDENTS 
</P>
<P>
Here is a chronology of Titan accidents, involving various models, over the 
last 25 years. Several accidents also occurred in earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 5, 1988: An expended first stage section of a liquid-fuel Titan 2 rocket 
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base exploded after separating from the 
second stage of the craft, which was otherwise successful in completing its 
mission of placing four spy satellites in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
April 18, 1986: A Titan 34D carrying a secret spy satellite exploded nine 
seconds after being launched from Vandenberg, causing minor injuries to 58 
people. Insulation on one of the solid-fueled booster rockets separated from 
the rocket casing, causing a "burn-through." 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 28, 1985: A Titan 34D was destroyed along with a spy satellite in a launch 
failure at Vandenberg Air Force Base caused by an oxidizer leak and a pump 
malfunction in the core booster. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 19, 1980: A Titan 2 missile exploded in its silo near Damascus, Ark., 
after a workman dropped a wrench and punctured its fuel tank. One man was 
killed and at least 21 were injured. Several others were stricken ill by toxic 
fumes during the days after the explosion. A nuclear warhead, thrown 200 yards 
by the explosion, landed without incident. The explosion was the eleventh Titan 
missile accident in Arkansas in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
March 25, 1978: A Titan 3C with twin military communications satellites was 
ordered destroyed shortly after malfunctioning on liftoff from Cape Canaveral. 
In other accidents in 1978, two people were killed and 27 were hospitalized in 
Kansas and Arkansas after exposure to highly toxic fumes associated with the 
liquid propellants. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 26, 1966: A Titan 3C rocket launched from Florida exploded shortly after 
liftoff, destroying a payload of eight communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 9, 1965: A flash fire caused when a welder's torch struck a line carrying 
combustible fluid killed 53 civilian workers who were renovating a Titan 1 silo 
near Damascus, Ark., to accommodate a newer Titan 2 missile.

TALK ABOUT MAPPING A DETAILED BUSINESS PLAN: THEIR PLAN IS MORE MAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Beard had been assessing the market potential for his new line of 
decorator wall maps by tacking them to bulletin boards in student unions, 
computer centers and geography departments from Cal Poly Pomona to the 
University of Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
He was encouraged to find that most were stolen the same day he put them up. 
</P>
<P>
But Beard saw even broader potential when a United Parcel Service delivery man 
paused at the map on Beard's office wall back in Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"He started talking about places where he'd gone hunting, fishing and rafting," 
Beard recalls. "He could really see where he had been. And my partner and I 
began to realize that we hadn't counted on that response to our maps from 
ordinary people who are more used to paying $3 in a vending machine for a road 
map." 
</P>
<P>
That was four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Raven Maps &amp; Images, a tiny company founded by two expatriate 
Californians, has caught the wave of public interest in all things 
environmental. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Raven's striking, highly detailed, yet inexpensive maps have jumped 
40% to 50% a year since 1986, guided by just such seat-of-the-pants consumer 
research. Most comes through a toll-free number and direct-mail marketing using 
mailing lists rented from the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society 
and other environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Beard reports that every year since 1986, Raven has doubled the number of 
catalogues it has sent out. They will mail as many as 500,000 copies in two 
weeks and expect to mail 1 million in their 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Beard projects sales for the seven-employee company to top $700,000 in 1990, 
though this could increase dramatically depending upon the success of a long 
labor of love, an other-worldly three-view portrait of the globe that the firm 
will begin to market later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Though Beard and Stuart Allan, his partner and the firm's cartographer, haven't 
pitched retailers, about 100 map and travel-equipment stores nationwide have 
seen their maps and arranged to sell them -- including Pasadena Map Co. in 
Pasadena and ALS (for Air, Land and Sea) Maps in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
"They have beautiful coloration, and they're darned accurate," says Jack Sera, 
an owner of ALS Maps. Sera reports that they sell especially well whenever he 
has the room to give them adequate display. 
</P>
<P>
"Their maps are very detailed," says Carolyn S. Hickey, manager of Pasadena Map 
Co. "But it's a real easy map to find things on, and a map you would enjoy 
looking at, because it's not real busy." 
</P>
<P>
That was the map maker's intent, at least with the company's most popular 
series, the individual state maps. 
</P>
<P>
"The main difference from other state maps," says Allan, "is that at a glance 
you see elevation and land form. If you look at a contour map, you have to 
figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
"People call me up all the time and tell me that with the California wall map, 
it's the first time they ever understand what the Central Valley is," says 
Beard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sense of depth on the state series is so immediate that many 
people take them to be three-dimensional relief maps. 
</P>
<P>
Other Raven products, maps that have been digitized and transformed by 
computer, are favorites on the walls of computer scientists and geologists. One 
is a map of Mt. St. Helens that looks like a carefully crumpled handkerchief. 
Another, billed as Blue Whale's Hawaii, is a striking view of the islands as a 
whale at sea level might see them -- both above and below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Once the map information, often taken from U.S. Geological Survey maps, is 
entered into the computer, the maps can be presented from various perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Such computer graphics are not unknown. But what attracts scientists and 
environmentalists to Raven's versions are both their beauty and their accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are computer experts, but don't know beans about geology," says 
Russell Guy, vice president and co-founder of Geoscience Resources, Inc., a 
Burlington, N.C., scientific supply company. "Raven maps were produced by 
professional geologists." 
</P>
<P>
Geoscience buys maps from more than 100 foreign and 35 state governments, as 
well as from such commercial map makers as Raven. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very few map makers for the public market have done this," says Guy. 
"It's very expensive and difficult to do." 
</P>
<P>
Often in professional map making, expensive products are targeted at a small, 
exclusive clientele. But Beard and Stuart decided they didn't want their work 
seen only in corporate boardrooms or similarly secluded circumstances. They 
decided to print on relatively inexpensive paper stock and to make their profit 
from volume. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the state series are priced at $20, or $45 for a map laminated with a 
1.5-mil vinyl coating on both sides. The larger world map will cost $35, or $60 
in the laminated version. 
</P>
<P>
"Volume is kind of a main thing here," says Beard. "We could have produced 
these maps only on museum quality linen and charged a very fancy price for 
them. We decided to print them at the $45 laminated rate, so more people could 
have them."

Merger Activity Declines: The number of mergers and acquisitions dropped 10% in 
August from July, while the dollar value of the deals fell 63%, IDD Information 
Services said. The research firm said 295 deals valued at $10.1 billion were 
announced in August, compared to 328 transactions valued at $26.9 billion in 
July. Elbert Ruff, senior analyst at IDD, attributed the drop to the increasing 
unpopularity of junk bond deals, making funding harder to come by, and to U.S. 
companies' growing preference for "strategic" rather than "financial" deals.

FHA Changes Will Hurt Home Buyers, Industry Says: A proposal passed by the 
Senate to require home buyers to pay a 3.8% insurance premium in cash at 
closing to qualify for a Federal Housing Administration mortgage could lock out 
35,000 to 200,000 people annually from the housing market, industry officials 
said. Currently, the FHA allows borrowers to fold the premium into the total 
value of the loan. Administration officials said the plan would lower default 
rates.

INVESTORS UPSET OVER LEGAL FEES IN LINCOLN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small investors who lost their life savings in the collapse of American 
Continental Corp. and its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan unit are grumbling about 
the fees their lawyers will be paid to recover some of the approximately $275 
million they lost. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Phoenix has approved a formula that would give the 
investors' lawyers $37.5 million if they recover $150 million of the money lost 
by American Continental debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
The formula gives lawyers 25% of the first $150 million recovered and 29% of 
any amount over that. It also provides for million-dollar incentives to recover 
certain amounts by specified dates and allows for out-of-pocket costs, 
according to a recent notice seeking investor approval of settlements reached 
with two defendants so far. 
</P>
<P>
If the lawyers recovered $250 million -- and few insiders expect that to happen 
-- they would receive $81 million in fees plus millions more in costs and 
incentive payments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest windfall that has hit the legal market," said Harold 
Rosenberg, a bondholder from Van Nuys who also is a lawyer. "Of course, the 
lawyers should be rewarded -- but how much?" 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said more than a dozen bondholders have expressed disapproval of the 
fee formula, especially since they generally believed that fees wouldn't exceed 
15% of the amount recovered. One plaintiffs' lawyer, Richard Greenfield of 
Philadelphia, said last year that legal fees have been as low as 7% in major 
class actions. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Barbaro of Santa Ana, one of the bondholders' attorneys, defended the 
formula, saying the case is "incredibly" complex and about 50 lawyers have been 
working more than a year on the case without any compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also have spent $5 million of their own money to pay such expenses 
as travel, filing fees and photocopying some of the 14 million pages of 
documents generated during the case. 
</P>
<P>
In class actions, plaintiffs' lawyers are typically paid from the pool of money 
they recover. The fee is usually set by the court once the case in completed.

Lotus to Upgrade 1-2-3 Software: On Monday, Lotus Development Corp. will start 
selling its Release 3.1 version of the best-selling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet 
software for personal computers. Many analysts say the latest version should 
have been introduced 15 months ago instead of Release 3.0, a version that many 
customers rejected, contributing to Lotus' earnings woes.

A total of 106 countries have so far replied to a U.N. request for details on 
what they are doing to implement sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of 
Kuwait, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He also said in a report that nine of the world body's 159 members have asked 
to hold consultations with the Security Council on resolving special economic 
problems they face as a result of the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
They are Bulgaria, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Philippines, Romania, Sri Lanka, 
Tunisia and Yugoslavia. In addition, Sudan and Yemen had indicated their 
intention of requesting consultations with the council. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, any country that finds itself facing special economic 
problems arising from applying U.N.-imposed sanctions "shall have the right to 
consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems." 
</P>
<P>
A Security Council committee set up to oversee implementation of the council's 
Aug. 6 sanctions resolution has been giving urgent consideration to the request 
from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Amman said last month it would suffer direct and indirect losses totaling $2 
billion a year as a result of cutting its economic links with Iraq and occupied 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Committee chairwoman Marjatta Rasi of Finland told reporters after a meeting 
Thursday that agreement was near on recommendations to the Security Council for 
assisting Jordan, but she gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which meets in private, has also heard presentations by 
representatives of several other countries claiming special hardship.

The crisis in the Persian Gulf could be settled peacefully if Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein got his teeth fixed, the personal dentist to the late guru Osho 
Rajneesh said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Swami Devageet said that Rajneesh, a mystic who was expelled from the United 
States in 1985 and died in January, discovered a year ago that "man's animal 
past, including his aggressive instincts, are mysteriously stored in the human 
dental structure." 
</P>
<P>
In a telex from the commune that Rajneesh founded in Poona, Devageet said that 
Hussein could become "a blissful human being instead of a blistering warmonger" 
if he submitted to tooth-centered character analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound absurd, but it's a lot cheaper than a third World War," Devageet 
said.

The U.N. Children's Fund, which last week appealed for $585,000 to aid 
thousands of refugees streaming into Jordan from Kuwait and Iraq, raised its 
target nearly tenfold Friday to $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers of affected persons continue to increase daily as more cross the 
borders. Those crossing now are generally of more limited means and therefore 
in need of greater support," UNICEF Executive Director James Grant said in a 
press statement. 
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said half a million people had entered Jordan since Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2. It said as many as half a million additional evacuees, poorer 
and more desperate, are expected to arrive soon.

five other key dissidents. Col. Than Tun, deputy chief of military

arrested. In Myanmar's May 27 national election, its first free voting in three 
decades, the league won 392 of 485 contested seats, but the military has

Four Fresno youth gang members pleaded innocent to murder and 17 other crimes 
in connection with a violent Labor Day weekend shooting rampage that killed one 
man and injured nine people. A Juvenile Court referee said he will decide Oct. 
2 if two of the gang members, both 16 years old, should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
The other two boys, ages 15 and 14, will face charges in Juvenile Court. The 
names of the suspects have not been released. They were captured on Labor Day 
and accused of rampaging through Fresno for four hours, shooting randomly at 
people on the street, after a plan to fire at other gang members was foiled by 
police. Two of the victims remain hospitalized with serious injuries.

25 PUPPIES' DEATHS ON AIRLINER PROBED

The U.S. Department of Agriculture Friday launched an investigation into the 
deaths of 25 purebred puppies aboard a United Airlines passenger flight from 
Chicago to San Diego. Two dozen animals were found dead in the cargo hold of 
Flight 141 after the plane arrived at Lindbergh Field Thursday at 3 p.m., two 
hours later than its scheduled touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Two other puppies and two kittens aboard the same flight survived the trip. 
Another puppy died Friday. United spokesman Rob Doughty said mechanical 
problems had delayed the plane at O'Hare Airport in intense noontime heat. 
Airport crews apparently neglected to remove the animals or give them 
ventilation, both standard procedures. "We are very, very upset," Doughty said. 
Twenty-nine animals in all were shipped from a kennel in Omaha, Neb., and put 
aboard a connecting flight at O'Hare. After leaving its gate, the aircraft 
experienced an overheated gas exhaust system, Doughty said. The problem took 
two hours to correct amid ramp temperatures close to 100 degrees, he said.

two women. Ricardo Estrada, 19, and Alfredo Rolando Prieto, 24, of Ontario, 
were arrested Thursday night in Ontario and were being held in San Bernardino 
County Jail. The victims were abducted from outside an Ontario home early 
Sunday morning by three men, then taken to a secluded area, where the teen-ager 
was shot to death and the other two stabbed.

HELICOPTER CRASH KILLS PILOT, HURTS 1

A pilot ferrying deer hunters to Bear Canyon near Ojai died Friday when his 
helicopter crashed while he was apparently trying to land it on a mountain 
ridge in the rugged backcountry, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Brunette, 64, was found dead at the scene at 9:35 a.m., about three hours 
after the crash, the Ventura County coroner's office said. The retired plumbing 
contractor apparently died of head injuries, Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said. 
An autopsy was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Brunette's passenger, Ron Cline Jr., 29, of Buellton, was taken to Ventura 
County Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman said Cline was in guarded 
condition with multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about two miles east of Rose Valley Work Camp, a Sheriff's 
Department jail facility in the Los Padres National Forest, Sheriff's Lt. Joe 
Funchess said. Officials said they did not know what caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Brunette apparently had agreed to fly three hunters from Rose Valley to Bear 
Canyon, a couple of miles away, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Cline was the first passenger Brunette picked up in his two-seat helicopter, 
Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunette apparently crashed when he was trying to set the helicopter down so 
Cline could get out, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
After the helicopter failed to return in two hours, the other two members of 
the hunting party notified authorities that something was wrong, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department received the alert about 8:30 a.m. and sent a 
helicopter to search for the aircraft, Funchess said. It was spotted at 9:25 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's workers were able to pick up Cline, who was clear of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Cline was flown to the hospital, where he was scheduled to be admitted to the 
intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. She said Cline was conscious 
and talking. 
</P>
<P>
A second helicopter was sent out about 10:30 a.m. to retrieve the pilot's body, 
said Dan Shea, a Sheriff's Department helicopter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was able to land about 100 yards from Brunette's small-model, 
piston-powered helicopter. Brunette's aircraft, which was heavily damaged, was 
worth $60,000 to $100,000, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter had crashed on a ridgeline about 5,000 feet in elevation, rolled 
onto its side and slid down the hill until it came to rest on the slope, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears they were probably trying to land or had mechanical difficulties," 
Shea said. The crash did not start a fire, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
Shea said the air currents in the area's rugged, mountainous terrain change 
from day to day and sometimes hour to hour. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, said 
Gary Mucho, director of the agency's southwest region. 
</P>
<P>
Board investigators and Federal Aviation Administration representatives planned 
to visit the accident scene today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunette is survived by his wife, Glenda, five daughters, one son and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Brunette kept his helicopter on a helipad about 100 feet from his single-story 
ranch-style house, which sits on a hillside just outside Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
He had the helicopter professionally serviced and "kept it in tiptop shape," 
Glenda Brunette said. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Brunette, a Santa Barbara native who had lived in the Ojai Valley since 
he was 18, also owned a single-engine Cessna airplane. In the past, he had 
raced motorboats, and he grew avocados on his small ranch, Glenda Brunette 
said.

UNDERTAKER UNABLE TO GET TRIAL MOVED

A Pasadena undertaker who is accused of poisoning a rival mortician with 
oleander failed Friday in his attempts to have his murder trial held in Los 
Angeles instead of Ventura and to have two Los Angeles prosecutors excused from 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. denied motions filed by David 
Wayne Sconce requesting a change of venue and asking that Los Angeles County 
Deputy Dist. Attys. Harvey Giss and James E. Rogan be barred from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce, 33, is accused of killing Timothy R. Waters, 24, who died of oleander 
poisoning in Simi Valley in 1985. Giss and Rogan were appointed special Ventura 
County deputy district attorneys because their office won a conviction against 
Sconce for illegally operating his family's mortuary in Hesperia. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, defense attorney Roger J. Diamond argued that Sconce should be tried 
in Los Angeles County because that is likely where Waters was poisoned. But 
Cooper said the murder is not considered to have been committed until the 
victim dies, and Sconce should be tried in Ventura County because Waters died 
there. 
</P>
<P>
After denying the motion to move the case, Cooper said the judge at the 
preliminary hearing scheduled for Oct. 1 should decide whether Sconce should be 
tried in Ventura County on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond also argued that Giss and Rogan should be excused because of a conflict 
of interest: Sconce has been charged with trying to hire someone to kill one of 
their colleagues, Los Angles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Walter H. Lewis, Diamond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond also expressed concern that Giss would use testimony from Los Angeles 
jail inmates who allegedly heard Sconce confess to Waters' poisoning. A Los 
Angeles County grand jury found in July that the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office has tolerated suspected perjury by jailhouse informants to 
help win murder cases. But the grand jury made no indictments or 
recommendations on the practice. 
</P>
<P>
However, Giss emphatically told Cooper that he would not use jailhouse 
witnesses in Sconce's case. 
</P>
<P>
And Giss said Friday that he was chosen for the Sconce case specifically 
because he knows Lewis only casually. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper ruled that no conflict of interest exists. MACK REED

BILL BOYARSKY: A VOTE FOR LETTING THE SACRAMENTO SHOW BEGIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council doesn't want to show telecasts of state 
legislative sessions on the city's public affairs channel. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly has offered to let the city pick up its sessions for free. So far, 
the city has said no. As a news junkie, I was enraged. I demanded an 
explanation. Nobody would talk on the record. But one city official said, "Why 
should we put on their show when we have our show?" 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking of the telecasts of Los Angeles council meetings. In other 
words, the Los Angeles City Council is afraid of competition. 
</P>
<P>
I protested that the City Council has a duty to show legislative sessions. None 
of the Los Angeles television stations cover Sacramento unless there's a 
terrible crisis. People here never see their state legislators in action. 
</P>
<P>
The City Hall official was unmoved. I suggested a plan: Have the Sacramento 
gang put together a highlights tape of "Great Moments in the Legislature." It 
would be like a National Football League highlights film. If you enjoy the 
tape, pick up the sessions. He shook his head and walked away. I interpreted 
this as permission to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
I advise state legislators to begin their highlights tape with the 
Legislature's great fights. 
</P>
<P>
One would be the 1 a.m. Peace vs. Ferguson scuffle in a corridor in the Capitol 
last week. According to witnesses, Democratic Assemblyman Steve Peace of Rancho 
San Diego slapped Republican Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach. The 
older but trickier Ferguson slipped the slap. It merely glanced off his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Then we'd go into the archives and pick up the most famous fight, the 1974 
battle of the century between former Assemblymen Lou Pappan, who used to be in 
the FBI, and Kenny Meade, an ex-UC Berkeley football player. Meade was KOd, his 
head cut and his eye blackened.

Of course, the star of "Great Moments" would be Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
of San Francisco. We'd see him at the rostrum, elegant in one of his many 
beautifully cut suits, making even the best dressed of his 79 colleagues look a 
bit dowdy. Democrats approach him with respect and fear, happy for a few small 
words from the Godfatherly boss. Republicans sit nervously at their desks, 
waiting for the next time he tries to slip something by them. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Moments" will show how he almost did, late last Friday night. A 
Republican rookie, the lowest form of life in Brown's world, presented his 
first bill. Brimming with good intentions, Jeff Marston of San Diego asked for 
an aye vote on legislation raising the fines for illegally parking in 
handicapped zones. 
</P>
<P>
From somewhere in his expensive suit, Brown pulled an opinion from the 
legislative legal office saying that Marston's bill violated a procedural rule. 
Marston is being challenged in November by a Democrat Brown likes, and the 
Speaker didn't want to build up the Republican. 
</P>
<P>
When the other Republicans figured out what was happening, they rallied to 
Marston's side. They refused to vote for one of the Speaker's bills, denying 
him the two-thirds majority he needed for its passage. Six hours later, Brown 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
That brings up the final highlights segment, humiliation. The Marston episode 
was humiliating for all concerned. But for real humiliation, we return to the 
archives, to the days of the late Speaker Jess Unruh in the 1960s. He knew how 
to humiliate. 
</P>
<P>
We'll show his revenge upon a Republican from South Gate, Floyd Wakefield. 
Wakefield had crossed Unruh. During a Capitol remodeling, the Speaker gave him 
a temporary office. The office also happened to be the men's toilet. When 
colleagues used the urinals, they walked past Wakefield, whose desk was in a 
small entry alcove. He could hear the flushes, and presumably worse, from his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable that the council would be afraid of such telegenic 
competition. The highlight of a council week is often ceremonial Friday, when 
restaurant owners, family friends, campaign contributors, city retirees, Little 
League baseball teams and foreign visitors are given hand-lettered 
proclamations and honored with long speeches. The only excitement is watching 
council members get mad when Gloria Molina lectures them. Instead of Willie 
Brown's suits, the council has Marvin Braude's plaid sport coats and polyester 
blazers. 
</P>
<P>
That won't sell in the era of the Simpsons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the City Council members ought to allow the Sacramento show on their 
station. Given the attitude of local television news directors, it is the only 
way Los Angeles viewers will ever see their state lawmakers at work. Whenever 
news directors here are asked why they don't cover Sacramento, they insist no 
viewers are interested. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that. At any rate, excitement -- and ratings -- shouldn't be standards 
for scheduling public television. Let the show begin.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS;

<P>
NOW OLD PHARMACY IS RECOVERY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to find the new Ojai Valley Center in Meiners Oaks, one of three 
recovery centers run by the Ventura County Department of Alcohol and Drug 
Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Just look for the rooftop sign that proclaims "DRUGS" in large letters that can 
be seen a block away. 
</P>
<P>
The former pharmacy, which served the rural community for more than three 
decades, closed shop two years ago and the building's owner has yet to remove 
the old sign, said Diana Sandefur, who staffs the new counseling center at 145 
W. El Roblar Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working with the owner to get the sign down," Sandefur said. "We wanted 
to get opened up first." 
</P>
<P>
Remodeled with a new lobby, carpeting, a kitchen with microwave and a classroom 
that seats about 20 people, the Ojai Valley Center opened in late June to 
provide counseling, referrals and a meeting room for groups that deal with 
alcohol, drugs and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is between a barbershop and a newly relocated pregnancy 
counseling service, is four blocks east of the busy Alano Club, where dozens of 
12-step support groups meet from dawn to dusk seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Alano Club, the counseling center does not allow tobacco smoking 
because it is a county facility, Sandefur said. The center is open from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and some evenings for group meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's open to any 12-step support group," Sandefur said, referring to groups 
that range from Alcoholics Anonymous to Overeaters Anonymous. However, she 
said, "we're trying to open it up to more community services to get more 
services to people in the valley." 
</P>
<P>
One little-known service, anonymous blood tests for the HIV or AIDS virus, is 
conducted once a month by a Ventura County Health Department team and is free. 
Test dates and times are posted on the center's door each month. Results are 
available in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other services include mental health counseling, assertiveness training and a 
court-mandated alcohol information school. A series of Sunday evening potlucks 
and games designed to bring families together will begin Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Soft "stress-reduction" music wafts through the building while Sandefur holds 
forth to clients. She also started a lending library of resource books that 
are, so far, mostly her own. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1987 as a satellite office to the West County Counseling Service 
on Main Street in Ventura, the center operated for three years in a downtown 
Ojai office building as the Ventura County Counseling Services. 
</P>
<P>
When the lease expired, the county could not afford the new rent, said Judi 
Balcerzak-Dyer, the county department's program manager for the alcohol 
services division. The satellite program is funded through state and federal 
grants, county allocations and low-cost client fees. 
</P>
<P>
The new location was chosen, she said, because it is near the Alano Club and 
the rent is affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be centrally located and it's on the bus line," Sandefur said. 
"The neighbors around here are wonderful too." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Pappas, owner of the beauty shop next door, said the center is a good 
neighbor. "They're pretty quiet," Pappas said. THIA BELL

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTY PAYS TUITION FOR SOCIAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a prolonged shortage of social workers needed to assist its burgeoning 
poor and homeless population, the county government is paying $336,000 for 20 
employees to get advanced social work degrees in exchange for signing an 
employment contract through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The employees, who began classes this week, will each receive $16,800 in 
tuition subsidies for a 27-month master's program run by USC's School of Social 
Work. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the students' full-time work schedules, USC instructors will 
offer part-time classes in the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
After civil engineers, social workers with master's degrees have been the most 
difficult employees to recruit, said Kim Voyle, manager of career development. 
About 30 of 200 social worker positions remained unfilled throughout the last 
year, and there was a 25% turnover rate in the staffed positions. 
</P>
<P>
The county pays employees with a master's degree in social work $26,000 to 
$40,000 a year, with higher salaries going to those with three or more years 
experience in a clinical setting. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 students chosen from a group of 35 applicants will be responsible for 
paying $175 of the $475-per-unit cost. Many have managed to secure financial 
aid to cover their $9,800 share of the tuition, Voyle said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the job contract, the employees agreed to work one year after graduation 
for each $2,500 that the county pays toward their education. Upon graduation in 
1993, they will be committed to work for the county for 6.7 years. CHRISTOPHER

AGENCY CONSIDERS SIMI VALLEY PLEA FOR FAST RULING ON HOPE ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission will consider on Wednesday 
Simi Valley's request for an early ruling on a proposed annexation of 
entertainer Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission agrees to the request, Simi Valley would have to submit an 
environmental impact report before an actual ruling is made, commission 
Director Bob Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the environmental document would be needed to help the 
five-member commission properly evaluate the annexation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials have requested an early ruling from the commission 
because they want to avoid the costly process of amending the city's General 
Plan if it appears that the annexation proposal is going to be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Braitman said that in the past the commission has not reviewed annexation 
proposals by cities until their General Plans have been amended and the 
necessary environmental impact reports completed. However, Braitman said, there 
is no law prohibiting the commission from changing its procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Although a draft environmental impact report has been completed on a housing 
development planned for Jordan Ranch, it does not include information about how 
the project would affect Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Braitman said if the commission decides to make an early ruling on the 
annexation proposal, the environmental impact report would have to be amended 
before it could be presented to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley E. Cohen, an attorney for Hope and Potomac Investment Associates, which 
has an option to buy Jordan Ranch, said that would not be a problem. Cohen said 
it would take about 45 days to make the necessary changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been anticipating this all along," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Hope and Potomac have proposed building 750 houses and a tournament golf course 
on the Jordan Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
In July, fearing the County Board of Supervisors would oppose the development, 
Hope asked the city of Simi Valley to annex both Jordan Ranch and his Runkle 
Ranch properties. 
</P>
<P>
Hope and his attorneys told the city that if it annexed his land, the 
entertainer would not sell Blind Canyon, part of the Runkle Ranch site, to the 
Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts for use as a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Simi Valley officials have not committed themselves to supporting the 
annexation, they have said the main reason they are considering it is to 
prevent a dump from being built at the gateway to their city. The city already 
has a landfill at its northwest end.

A 15-year-old El Rio boy underwent emergency surgery Friday after being 
accidentally shot by a friend who was examining a handgun, a Ventura County 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Adane suffered arm and chest wounds in the 11:15 a.m. shooting on Balboa 
Street, Senior Sheriff's Deputy Steve Joneson said. 
</P>
<P>
Adane was listed in fair condition after surgery at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sheriff's Department, Raymond Coronel, 15, was holding a 
.22-caliber pistol as he and Adane examined the weapon. The gun discharged, and 
a bullet struck Adane in the arm and entered his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Joneson said that investigators have deemed the shooting an accident and that 
no charges have been filed. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

MISSION COLLEGE: FOR FOREIGN TEACHERS, OBTAINING CREDENTIALS CAN BE A STRUGGLE. 
BUT A NEW PROGRAM MAY HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Blanca Cerrillos said she lasted one day at the Sun Valley garment factory 
where she took a job in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The work was so hard, I couldn't get up the next day," Cerrillos said. "I came 
to Los Angeles to be a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
The former Mexican elementary school teacher soon discovered that getting her 
California teaching credential was no easy job either. Cerrillos enrolled in 
college courses for seven years and took the state teachers' exam five times 
before passing and becoming eligible to teach elementary school in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Cerrillos, who was hired this week to teach fifth grade at Hubbard Street 
School in Sylmar, hopes to be an example to hundreds of foreign-born teachers 
trying to obtain their state teaching credentials through a unique program 
starting Monday at Mission College in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The program, the Bilingual Expressway, is funded with a three-year, $300,000 
grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Federal officials, in awarding the 
grant this week, praised the Mission College program and said they hope it will 
become a model for universities trying to meet the growing demand nationwide 
for bilingual teachers. Cerrillos is a volunteer adviser to the program. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, school district officials estimate it will take 10 years to 
hire the needed number of bilingual teachers. About 30% of the district's 
610,000 students are Spanish-speakers who are learning English. 
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 800 foreign-born teachers from throughout Los Angeles have 
signed up for the Mission College program, Victoria Richart, dean of academic 
affairs, said. The program will offer classes in English and analyze foreign 
course transcripts to determine what classes the students must take to meet 
state teaching requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual counselors also will hold workshops on the California Basic 
Educational Skills Test -- which is required of all teachers -- and will guide 
students without college degrees through the bureaucratic maze involved in 
signing up for classes and transferring from two-year to four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Such advice would have saved Israel Avalos a lot of trouble. The former 
elementary school teacher in El Salvador completed courses in philosophy and 
sociology at Mission College several years ago to fulfill requirements for a 
bachelor's degree. He found out later that he didn't need the classes because 
he had already passed those subjects at a university in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Avalos, who obtained his liberal arts degree at Cal State Northridge in June 
and also will serve as an adviser to the Mission College program, taught for 10 
years in the Salvadoran town of Suchitoto before coming to Lake View Terrace in 
1978. He quickly discovered that he was not eligible to teach in the Los 
Angeles school district so he found work in a plastics factory. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had to start over," Avalos said. "The work was hard and after awhile 
I said to myself, 'I have to do something better.' So I signed up for English 
classes at night." 
</P>
<P>
After gaining confidence in English, Avalos began taking courses at Mission 
College to prepare for his return to teaching. He quit his factory job and 
began work as a teacher's aide at Fenton Avenue School in Lake View Terrace. 
Attending classes at night, he completed a two-year degree at Mission College 
and went on to CSUN, where he is enrolled in the teacher credentialing program. 
</P>
<P>
Avalos said he, Cerrillos, and a handful of Latino immigrants aspiring to be 
teachers in the United States have become close friends and stuck with their 
goal despite having to support themselves with full-time jobs. For all of them, 
one of the biggest struggles, and most rewarding successes, was mastering 
English, Avalos said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it was very discouraging," said Cerrillos, who taught first grade in 
Via Victoria, a small town in the Mexican state of Michoacan. "When you don't 
know English, people can be very rude. They yell, 'What?' You feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
But now Cerrillos and Avalos say they can assist students signing up for the 
Mission College program. Officials of CSUN, as well as the Los Angeles school 
district, have promised to cooperate with Mission College officials to smooth 
the path for the prospective teachers, who can expect a starting salary of 
about $35,000 a year in Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through a lot but I know my experience will help others," Cerrillos 
said. "They can look at me and say, 'She did it. I can do it.' "

<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has agreed to help replace the Camarillo 
Airport's runway lights after the system was deemed inadequate in a recent 
inspection, county airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the Ventura County Aviation Advisory Commission, the 
FAA would pay $595,000 of the lighting improvement costs. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $70,000 would come from the county airport budget. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted Thursday night to accept the grant along with another FAA 
grant for Oxnard Airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
Charles McCormick, an FAA electrical engineer, notified airport officials of 
several problems with the Camarillo Airport's runway lighting after an 
inspection in May, said Barbara Sominsky, assistant to Airports Administrator 
James G. O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
To fix the problems, the airport's high-intensity runway lights would be 
replaced by more moderate lights, Sominsky said. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency generator, new transformers and other runway identification lights 
would be installed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has agreed to provide $208,000 of an estimated $230,000 needed to 
construct two helicopter pads and to improve service roads at Oxnard Airport.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 12 YEARS IN SLAYING OF SALVADORAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Van Nuys man was sentenced Friday to 12 years and four months in 
prison for voluntary manslaughter in the death of one of two men he beat 
unconscious and threw off a cliff on Mulholland Drive in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
George Ubillus originally was charged with murder in the Sept. 18, 1989, death 
of Carlos Renderos, a Salvadoran whose age authorities estimated at 21. 
</P>
<P>
But in August, in a plea bargain with prosecutors, Ubillus was allowed to plead 
no contest to voluntary manslaughter and to one count of robbery in the theft 
of a man's wallet and clothing at a nearby park a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the plea agreement, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond A. 
Mireles sentenced Ubillus to the maximum term possible for those crimes, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement was made because Ubillus was drunk at the time of the 
killing and was expected to claim at his trial that he beat the victims in 
self-defense, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuel, the prosecutor in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Ubillus beat Renderos and Francisco Arevalos, 20, unconscious after they came 
to the aid of two women being taunted by Ubillus and a group of about a dozen 
other youths, Los Angeles police said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 KILLED, 2 INJURED IN HIGH-SPEED CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and two others were seriously injured Friday when a speeding 
car went out of control on the Hollywood Freeway in Studio City and crashed 
into a barrier wall, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John Lessentine said the accident occurred about 2:30 a.m. in the 
northbound lanes of the Hollywood Freeway near the Lankershim Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the 18-year-old Hollywood man who was killed in the crash was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was driving the car at about 100 m.p.h. when he lost control of it 
and hit the freeway median, Lessentine said. The car rebounded across all the 
northbound lanes of the freeway, went up an embankment and hit a light pole and 
barrier wall. The car overturned, ejecting the driver and two passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The driver died at the scene. Passengers Carlos A. Juarez, 23, of Hollywood and 
a 17-year-old Hollywood youth whose name was not released suffered serious 
injuries and were being treated at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, 
Lessentine said.

<P>
The board of directors of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys voted 
unanimously to rebuke Reiner Wednesday night after both Reiner and former 
Menendez prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, appeared before the 
group. Five of the 18 board members were absent. 
</P>
<P>
A one-sentence press release from association President David Ross said 
Thursday the organization "lacks confidence in the district attorney's 
judgment" in pulling the prosecutor off the case that has drawn worldwide media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Alhadeff, 52, a 24-year veteran of the office, earlier was selected to be 
honored next week as the association's prosecutor of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He was removed as lead prosecutor on Aug. 16 and replaced by Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Pamela Ferrero, one of the prosecutors in the second McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was unavailable for comment, but his spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons, said 
Alhadeff was pulled from the case after several briefings with Reiner. "The 
district attorney has a responsibility to the people of Los Angeles County to 
put the best possible prosecution team on a case," Gibbons said. "That's what 
he gets paid for." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gibbons would not say what Reiner's problem was with Alhadeff, who has 
won a string of court decisions favorable to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Menendez, 22, and his brother, Erik Menendez, 19, are charged in the 1989 
shotgun murders of their wealthy parents. In the early phases of the 
investigation before the brothers were arrested and charges filed, Ferrero was 
assigned to the case. She had to give it up when she was tapped for the 
McMartin retrial. 
</P>
<P>
The association has no power over Reiner, except in the arena of public 
opinion, and has been supportive of the district attorney. The board voted to 
endorse Reiner over incumbent Robert Philibosian when Reiner first won office 
in 1984 -- a major boost for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And when Reiner announced plans to seek reelection in 1988, he was encircled by 
smiling members of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys board, which endorsed 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion is divided on whether the group's new willingness to publicly criticize 
Reiner is an isolated incident, an indication of deep dissatisfaction within 
the office or the result of his vulnerability after his defeat in the state 
attorney general primary in June. Most board members contacted by The Times 
refused to comment for the record. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it should be understood the action that the board took is 
absolutely unprecedented," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Marsh Goldstein, a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the removal of a respected prosecutor from a high-publicity case -- 
without stating the reasons -- is "bad for morale" and calls Reiner's 
competence into question. . . . We question his judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Ross characterized the vote, which followed a spirited discussion, as 
significant. "It's a major move . . . to disagree publicly with your boss." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, Alhadeff and other members of the association board emphasized that their 
dispute was not with their fellow prosecutor, Ferrero. 
</P>
<P>
As Alhadeff tells it, he was called into Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg 
Thompson's office the day before leaving for vacation. A press release 
announcing his removal was read to him. The office's official position was that 
Ferrero wanted the case back. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from vacation, Alhadeff said he found that many of his 
colleagues were upset on his behalf. In the past few days, Alhadeff met with 
Thompson, then with Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was told his competence was not at issue. "I walked in there 
concerned it may be a reflection on my competence and reputation and walked out 
of there being assured it was not. . . . I think there may have been a 
personality problem," Alhadeff said. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Alhadeff said, it was a problem he did not know about until it was too 
late. "I'm disappointed I was removed from the case," he said.

ANGRY ARTIST; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIP CORNELIUS DOESN'T MIND A LITTLE TURMOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDYE HODER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When artist Philip Cornelius makes teapots, he provides the tempest too. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do is so freaky, I can't have anyone around," he says, his speech 
punctuated by expletives, his eyes flashing behind tortoise-shell glasses, his 
thick hands swirling through the air. "I can't be disturbed. If I get 
disturbed, I fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
At 56, he is one of America's most acclaimed best known for his "thinware" 
designs. Cornelius, who has taught at Pasadena City College for 25 years, molds 
delicate sheets of porcelain into abstract forms, almost all based on the 
common household teapot. 
</P>
<P>
He says he likes teapots because they are containers, and like all containers, 
they are useful. "Containment is important to me because it has a sense of 
function," he says. "Teapots are big ugly things. It took me to turn them into 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cornelius' teapots don't look anything like what you'd find on a 
kitchen stove. Many of them are charred, rough-hewn vessels, evoking images of 
warships, planes and tanks. But they also somehow convey a sense of refinement 
and vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Clark, who represents Cornelius and sells his pieces at Los Angeles and 
New York galleries for as much as $3,500 each, calls the work "highly 
contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
There is a tension "between being tough and hard and being fragile and 
vulnerable," Clark says. "These objects are very much about contradiction." 
</P>
<P>
So is the artist. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher, Cornelius is giving and interested in his students' work. But as 
an artist, he is intensely private and guarded about his own. 
</P>
<P>
In his classroom, where 17 students wear aprons to protect themselves from a 
blanket of red clay and gray dust, Cornelius demonstrates basic ceramic-making 
techniques. But he doesn't discuss the trademark style that has taken him 
decades to develop: working with incredibly fine layers of clay and yet still 
firing them in the kiln at intensely hot temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my job to show them what I do," Cornelius says, lifting his cap from 
his head and running his fingers through his slightly graying hair. "It's 
really none of their business. I don't need to open my soul to them." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cornelius divides his time between the classroom and the studio behind 
his Spanish-style home in Pasadena, the artist has been careful to keep the two 
worlds separate. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Cornelius' students, in fact, have no idea that their teacher has 
pieces featured in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the 
Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot from him in just two weeks," says John Sih, 28, an engineer 
who took his first ceramics class at Pasadena City College this summer. "I had 
no idea that he is so well known. I guess I wouldn't really expect that here." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius began teaching at PCC in 1965 after earning his undergraduate degree 
in science from San Jose State University and a master's in fine arts from 
Claremont Graduate School. He says he has continued to teach at the community 
college all these years because the school has given him the freedom to do his 
own work. "Professor/artist, artist/professor -- both are an important part of 
who I am and what I do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someone who teaches at a major university or a prestigious art school 
has more professional clout than I do. But I'm not into professional clout, I'm 
into art clout. I don't take my power from teaching, I take my power from what 
I do with clay." 
</P>
<P>
Teaching at PCC, Cornelius says, "has enabled me to lead a fairly normal life, 
to pay the bills and raise a family. It would have been too spooky for me to be 
an artist and raise two kids. It would have been living too much on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius' current work is an exploration of mayhem, an idea that has always 
interested him. Earlier teapots drew inspiration from World Wars I and II. The 
newest series, he says, refers to a new breed of war. The teapots, dotted with 
body parts, are charred in the kiln "almost like third-degree burns." 
</P>
<P>
He mentions Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot on my mind now," Cornelius says. "We have had an unprecedented 
peace, and now we are going to have an unprecedented amount of war." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius' propensity for firing his pieces until they are on the verge of 
destruction is as important an expressive quality as the way he shapes the 
clay. "Putting them in the kiln is like putting them in a tomb," he says. "I 
like to fire right to the edge. It's like they've been through a war." 
</P>
<P>
His work, consequently, is not always pleasant to look at. Wayne Kuwada, 
director of the Garth Clark Gallery in Los Angeles, says Cornelius' work is 
"tougher than a lot of what you see in the ceramic world." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the imagery, his stuff isn't particularly soothing," Kuwada says. 
"You have to go beyond looking for the beautiful object. He always takes his 
work a step beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Says Cornelius: "No one fires as hard as I do. And if they did, I'd fire even 
harder." 
</P>

NORTHRIDGE DIGS DEEP FOR QUARTERBACK; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: INJURIES GIVE BRATTEN HIS FIRST START AFTER A WAIT OF FOUR 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement came from the coaching staff at the conclusion of practice 
Wednesday night. It wasn't anything that Greg Bratten didn't already know. 
</P>
<P>
After four seasons on the lower rungs of the Cal State Northridge quarterback 
ladder, Bratten would be the starter in tonight's home opener against Eastern 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
What Coach Bob Burt was saying with the team huddled around him, Bratten had 
learned during that evening's practice. Marty Fisher, trying to play with a 
slightly separated right (throwing) shoulder, had been hit on a practice play. 
Fisher stopped in his tracks, turned to quarterbacks coach Pat Degnan and said, 
"There's just no way." 
</P>
<P>
With that sentence, Bratten, who a week ago failed to make the traveling squad 
for CSUN's opener at Northern Arizona, became the team's No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, a sophomore, had taken over at Northern Arizona when Sherdrick Bonner, 
the Matadors' senior starter, severely sprained his right ankle early in the 
second quarter. Fisher also suffered a shoulder injury in the game. Bonner 
isn't expected to see action until Sept. 22 at Central (Okla.) State. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has three quarterbacks left: Albert Razo, the team's second-string 
punter; Coley Kyman, best-known as one of the nation's top young volleyball 
players; and Bratten, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound fifth-year senior who, Burt 
estimates, "has taken about five snaps," in his collegiate career. 
</P>
<P>
Six, actually. "I was in for two series as a sophomore," Bratten said. 
</P>
<P>
Bratten is Northridge's most experienced quarterback in terms of practice time. 
Problem is, he usually is running the opponent's plays against the Matador 
defense. "I can tell you everything about UC Davis," Bratten quipped. 
</P>
<P>
A walk-on who pays his own way through school, Bratten said he never dreamed 
he'd become the starting quarterback. "Getting two quarterbacks hurt in one 
game? You don't hear about that happening too often," he said. "It's 
unfortunate, but as a backup you have to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
His confidence was boosted when several teammates approached him with 
encouraging words. "They know I can do it," Bratten said. "I've just been in 
the position where I had two really good quarterbacks ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
A love for the game is all that kept him coming back. "It's always been fun," 
Bratten said. "That's the attitude I've taken. That as long as it was still 
fun, I'd be out there." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern New Mexico is playing its opener after going 7-3 and finishing in a 
second-place tie last season in the strong Long Star Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, it's not going to be because of our quarterbacks," Burt said. "I 
go with the theory, and I tell the kids this all the time, it's 'Who's next?' 
We can't worry about who can't go. I mean, what difference is it going to make? 
. . . Every guy has to be ready when his chance comes." 
</P>
<P>
Burt said that Kyman, previously No. 4 on the depth chart, would also 
"undoubtedly" see action. This from a coach who used to roll his eyes when 
asked abut Kyman's chances of ever playing quarterback for the Matadors. That 
was before he finally saw Kyman play. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman is 6-6, 210 pounds, agile, strong and a fiery leader. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot of ability," Burt said a few weeks ago. "He could play here 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
The day wasn't supposed to come this soon. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman sat out last football season, but played volleyball and was among only 
two freshmen selected to the All-Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. team. 
He played in his second Olympic Festival this summer, then faced the decision 
of trying out for football or for the U.S. "B" volleyball team that would 
compete internationally. 
</P>
<P>
He chose football. "The volleyball opportunity will be there again," Kyman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, CSUN's starter last season, was the only Matador quarterback with 
considerable game experience before last week. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher completed 17 of 31 passes for 180 yards against Northern Arizona in his 
first extended action and, despite the 37-3 loss, drew rave reviews from Burt. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was little reason to revel in the praise. Shortly after the 
game, Fisher was searching for the team trainer. 
</P>
<P>
On his first pass play after replacing Bonner, Fisher was hit hard by a 
blitzing Northern Arizona linebacker. He finished the game in extreme pain, 
explaining later, "When you're playing, the heat of battle kind of keeps you 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Burt expressed hope that such competitive spirit would allow 
Fisher to play against Eastern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching the films and seeing the stuff Marty can do should give our kids a 
sense of security," Burt said. "They know they've got two guys they can win 
with. Who knows, maybe this week we'll find out we can win with three."

MOTOR RACING / BRIAN MURPHY;

RAYBURN THIRSTS TO TOAST VINTAGE SEASON 
</P>

<P>
It will not be difficult to spot Craig Rayburn tonight at Saugus Speedway. 
He'll be the one wearing Topsiders. And, perhaps, pouring champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Such a combination is quite rare at the Saugus track, where beer and cowboy 
boots are more the style. 
</P>
<P>
But Rayburn, of Simi Valley, is to be forgiven for his breach of etiquette. 
Tonight, he stands poised to clinch the Street Stock championship on the final 
night of racing in that division. After a strong effort last week that included 
a main-event win in the figure-eight and a fifth-place finish in the oval main 
event, Rayburn has a 14-point lead over Reseda's Dave Blankenship, whom he has 
battled all summer for the points lead. 
</P>
<P>
The most points a Street Stock driver can pick up in a night is 29, provided he 
wins every possible main event and heat race. Rayburn figures that all he has 
to do is score 15 points to clinch. 
</P>
<P>
That means he needs to finish no lower than sixth in both main events. Rayburn 
is confident he can perform that task. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to be presumptuous," Rayburn said. "But all I have to do is basically 
finish both (main events)." 
</P>
<P>
The points championship would be Rayburn's first in Street Stock competition 
after a slew of top-10 finishes. To commemorate the occasion, and to make sure 
everything goes as planned, he says he will wear his "lucky shoes" and all of 
his family, friends and pit crew members will wear their "lucky shirts." 
</P>
<P>
The lucky shoes are a pair of Topsiders that Rayburn, 27, has had since ninth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, they're kinda worn out," Rayburn said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The shirts that are intended to bring good fortune are "Gus's Tools" T-shirts. 
And the champagne? 
</P>
<P>
It will be poured after the races are run, provided all goes well. There are 
strict speedway rules prohibiting alcohol in the pits until racing is over. And 
Rayburn wouldn't want to be disqualified on such a sobering technicality. 
</P>
<P>
Add Rayburn: With one more night of Sportsman racing set for a week from today, 
Rayburn also is in position to finish among the top five drivers in the final 
points standings. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we're putting together a good motor for next week," Rayburn said. 
</P>
<P>
A double top-five finish would be the first in speedway history. 
</P>
<P>
In drag: The National Hot Rod Assn. storms into L. A. County Raceway this 
weekend for the Palmdale Meet, the fourth event of the Pacific Division Winston 
drag racing series. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining the event will be Santa Maria-based Blaine Johnson, who recorded the 
best time ever in his class with a 5.872-second run at the Texas Motorplex. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson already has clinched the Top Alcohol Dragster title with a near-perfect 
season, including titles in five national events. 
</P>
<P>
Also racing will be the Alcohol Funny Cars, led by Brad Anderson in a Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is undefeated at Palmdale over the past decade and will have 
competition from the likes of Pacific Division points leader Lou Gasparrelli, 
David Baca, Mike Gordon and Jim Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day event, which started yesterday, expects to draw more than 400 
race cars from all over the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Among the classes of competition: Premiere Dragster, Competition Eliminator, 
Super Stock, Stock, Super Gas, Super Comp and Super Street.

PLUSH CANYONS STADIUM NEEDS A TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get this straight. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge, a university with more than 30,000 students and a 
football team that has been a winner for four consecutive years, will play host 
to Eastern New Mexico tonight in a stadium that can graciously be described as 
antique. 
</P>
<P>
A broken down, insect-infested antique. 
</P>
<P>
North Campus Stadium has approximately 6,000 available seats -- more than half 
of which are temporary. The press box is open air, so there is no need for 
ticket holders to tune in to KGIL radio for Joe Buttitta's play-by-play. They 
can hear it live. And the lights? Players could see better tonight if the 2,000 
or so fans all lit a match. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the best football facility in the region will be empty tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The football stadium at College of the Canyons has an estimated capacity of 
7,000, an enclosed, climate-controlled (trendy way of saying it has a heater) 
press box, lights you could read the classifieds by, and, since 1981, no 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
What a waste. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons had a football team from 1967 to 1981 before the district dropped the 
sport as part of a massive budget cut. Pierce College did the same thing a few 
years ago, but its program was quickly resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyons, which serves the football-crazed area of the Santa Clarita Valley, 
there are no such plans. 
</P>
<P>
Hart and Canyon high schools, whose graduates form a large percentage of 
Canyons' 6,000 enrollment, have won a combined 56 football games in the past 
three seasons. A few of the players from those teams have earned football 
scholarships to four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
A much larger percentage weren't big enough, fast enough or strong enough -- at 
the time -- for the big time. They enrolled at junior colleges. Not the local 
school. Instead, they traveled to Valley, Pierce, Glendale, Antelope Valley and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Some people can make light of the situation. The vagabond players are "away 
from home, but not so far away that they can't take the laundry home on 
weekends," said Harry Welch, Canyon High's popular football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he has never heard one of his athletes complain about not being able 
to play for the local junior college. 
</P>
<P>
Others have. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Herrington, coach at Hart High, has a brother, Dean, who was an 
All-Southern Section quarterback at Hart in 1981. Dean planned to attend 
Canyons until the school dropped football. Instead, he went to Pasadena City 
College. "We need the local community college to have a program," Mike 
Herrington says. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a couple of attempts to bring the sport back. A few years ago, 
a study concluded that it would cost more than $300,000 -- a figure Herrington 
says is ridiculously high -- to start it up again. College board members showed 
little interest in making such an investment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a real supportive cast there," Canyons Athletic Director Lee 
Smelser says. 
</P>
<P>
When Canyons dropped football, the school's enrollment was only about 2,000 and 
most of the players were recruited from outside the area. The faculty and board 
believed too much money was being spent on students who came from outside the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
That was before the Santa Clarita Valley became a hotbed for the real estate 
boom of the '80s. Canyons' enrollment has more than tripled, even though there 
are some who believe its growth has been stunted by the lack of an 
extracurricular activity with the popularity of football. 
</P>
<P>
Smelser says there are those in the Canyons athletic department who would be 
overjoyed to have football back. Herrington says there is some support for it 
in the community. Both agree that a stronger endorsement is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not a real big noise right now," Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
What a waste. 
</P>
<P>
Weird statistics: Northern Arizona was credited with only eight first downs -- 
four passing and four rushing -- in a 37-3 win over Northridge last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Lumberjacks' passing first downs all came on touchdowns, covering 76, 10, 
63 and 41 yards. Northern Arizona quarterback John Bonds passed for 292 yards, 
of which 190 came on the four scoring plays. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Cal State Northridge lost its starting quarterback and free 
safety to injury in last Saturday's football game, but Northern Arizona's only 
injury was far more serious. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn Fauria, the Lumberjacks' starting fullback, sustained a knee injury in 
the first quarter that required surgery the next day. Fauria, a redshirt 
freshman from Crespi High, is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge hopes that free safety Clayton Bamberg will play tonight in the 
Matadors' home opener against Eastern New Mexico. Quarterback Sherdrick Bonner 
will miss the contest but should be ready for CSUN's next game, Sept. 22 at 
Central (Okla.) State. 
</P>
<P>
Rumor mill: Expect Jody Robinson, former assistant to Augie Garrido at 
Illinois, to be hired as top assistant for the Northridge baseball team. 
Robinson was on the same Cal State Fullerton staff as current CSUN Coach Bill 
Kernen when the Titans won the NCAA World Series championship in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has been an assistant at Illinois for three seasons. When Garrido 
returned to Fullerton, Robinson applied for the top post at Illinois but was 
passed over in favor of former Southern Illinois Coach Richard Jones.

Saugus 28, South Pasadena 0 -- Quarterback Jeff Hickman led the Centurions to a

second half. 
</P>
<P>

completed his only pass of the game, a screen pass that David Doyle turned into 
a 70-yard touchdown for Saugus' final score.

<P>
Doyle, who had nine carries for 32 yards and three receptions for 96 yards, 
scored the Centurions' first touchdown on a six-yard run in the second quarter.

line and scored with seven seconds left in the half when Hickman hit Alex 
Flores with a 30-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Flores blocked a South Pasadena punt on the 14-yard line

MTV: THE NAUGHTY ENVELOPE, PLEASE;

<P>
TELEVISION: THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PROGRAM PROVIDES IMPROMPTU STAGE FOR 
MUSICIANS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What so proudly they hailed, 'round about the twilight's last gleaming Thursday 
night at the MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, was Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
The target of controversy recently for threatening not to perform if the 
American national anthem were played before her show at a New Jersey hall, 
O'Connor won scattered boos but more cheers on Thursday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre as she picked up three MTV Video Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting the best video of the year honor for "Nothing Compares 2 U," which 
came after her awards in the best female video and best post-modern video 
categories, a seemingly surprised and bashful O'Connor thanked her associates 
and then used the podium as a platform to address the issue that was the 
dominant motif of the irreverent three-hour show -- the C-word. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very great respect for people of all countries, including American 
people," said O'Connor, defending her action in New Jersey. "I'd like to say 
that my attitude over the national anthem was in order to bring attention to 
the censorship issue. As far as I'm concerned, censorship in any form is bad, 
but when it's racism disguised as censorship, that's even worse, and that was 
the point I was trying to make." 
</P>
<P>
Host Arsenio Hall helped defang the seriousness of the moment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinead! Way to go, baby!" yelled a typically cheerleader-ish Hall (who had 
called the Irish singer "that cute little lady with the bald head" earlier). "I 
never heard 'em sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at a concert! Maybe you ended 
up at a baseball game or something -- you took a wrong turn!" 
</P>
<P>
If inevitably seen by some as self-aggrandizing, O'Connor's was one of the more 
tasteful plugs for freedom of speech in a self-consciously naughty show that -- 
with racy performances by Madonna and 2 Live Crew -- pushed the edge of the 
envelope of what can be shown on TV, or MTV, but nonetheless stayed well within 
the realm of self-censorship. (KTTV-TV Channel 11 will rebroadcast the show 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year's show, which featured profane comedy from now-banned 
Andrew Dice Clay and a backstage fistfight between members of Motley Crue and 
Guns N' Roses, the 1990 telecast was relatively tame. But it wasn't for lack of 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
Proudly introduced by actor Eric Bogosian as "my fellow Americans -- with 
honor," the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew performed one of its few 
non-misogynistic songs, "Banned in the U.S.A.," sounding like ventriloquists' 
dummies as they haplessly parroted quasi-patriotic defenses of their First 
Amendment rights. In a show of rap solidarity, M.C. Hammer, Public Enemy's 
Flavor Flav and members of N.W.A. also walked out on stage. 
</P>
<P>
If 2 Live Crew (w)rapping its dirty ditties in the flag lacked class, the 
clean-imaged M.C. Hammer still managed perhaps even worse taste -- by showing 
up at the podium to accept his best rap and best dance video awards pointedly 
swigging and plugging the diet cola whose advertisements featuring him 
dominated the commercial breaks in the show. The audience half-expected him to 
announce he was going to Disneyland next. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was also a contender in the most shameless sweepstakes, with an 
otherwise wittily choreographed "Vogue" dance number -- in an amusingly 
incongruous baroque setting -- marred by moments in which subservient boy 
dancers in short pants placed their hands on her heaving bosom (twice) and 
stuck their heads up her dress (twice). 
</P>
<P>
Far more shocking was Cher, who showed up to present the climactic award . . . 
conservatively dressed. 
</P>
<P>
The best rock 'n' roll moment occurred off-camera, when Aerosmith ripped 
through a rave-up version of the Beatles' "I'm Down" during a commercial break 
before performing the scheduled "Love in an Elevator" -- for which the veteran 
group won best hard rock/metal video. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you Tipper (Gore) and Jesse (Helms)," said singer Steven Tyler, keeping 
the evening's main riff going, "for making sure that as long as there are a few 
four-letter words on the album, it'll sell an extra million copies!" 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included Don Henley (best male video), the B-52's (best group 
video), Michael Penn (best new artist), Billy Idol (best video from a film) and 
Tears for Fears (breakthrough video). Madonna herself was shut out, though her 
"Vogue" video won in three technical categories, including best director for 
David Fincher.

FACES . . . : 'LOST CAPONE'S' PASDAR: IT TOOK A FEW BREAKS TO GET WHERE HE IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN LIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adrian Pasdar's career began quite literally by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old actor, who stars in Monday's TNT movie "The Lost Capone," was a 
literature major at the University of Central Florida when he got in a car 
wreck that sent him through the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a while to recupe," he recalls of the 1983 incident. "I finished 
out the school year and moved back home to Philadelphia, where I did a lot of 
odd jobs, like paving driveways. I also worked backstage at a theater building 
scenery." 
</P>
<P>
It was on this job that he had his second accident -- he cut off part of his 
left thumb. "At that point," he says, "with the workman's comp, I was able to 
live at the YMCA in New York and study at Strasberg" -- the renowned Lee 
Strasberg Institute, that is. From then on, all of Pasdar's accidents have been 
lucky ones, beginning with his first acting job, a small role in "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, everybody hates me for that," he jokes. "I was really fortunate to get 
it as my first role. I could've ended up in a B horror film, being eaten by an 
18-foot mechanical monster." 
</P>
<P>
Pasdar now has nine motion picture roles to his credit, including the lead in 
"Torn Apart," a Romeo-and-Juliet story set in the Middle East being re-released 
Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, he's starring in "The Secret Sits in the Middle" at the 3rd Street 
Theatre in Los Angeles, and he'll appear opposite Justine Bateman in "Love 
Letters" the week of Sept. 18. Not bad for an actor who once was so broke he 
had to live at LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when I first came out here to do 'Top Gun,' " he explains. "I even 
had my own pay phone there, where everybody knew they could reach me." 
</P>
<P>
Pasdar lives by the beach now and does a lot of reading in his spare time -- 
which, hopefully, will cause him no greater harm than an occasional paper cut.

PRAISE FOR L.A. FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been my pleasure to attend three L.A. Festival performances this week. 
</P>
<P>
My hat is off to Sellars and the entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
For the performances we attended, no one paid admission and the productions did 
not cost the federal taxpayer a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
My question is why has The Times' festival coverage been so negative? When an 
event this important to the cultural life of the city comes off this 
successfully it should be celebrated, not criticized.

PETER SELLARS' REMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled when I read "The Artist at the Helm" (Aug. 31), which was about 
Los Angeles Festival Director Peter Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
That a public figure would say "it doesn't make you look like a low-IQ retard" 
is almost unbelievable. And that his cast giggled in response says a lot about 
their IQs. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, Times staff writer Greg Braxton and The Times editing staff all owe 
apologies for having said, written and published this remark. 
</P>

 Sellars made the comment in directing the "Nixon in China" cast to actually 
converse rather than to mime conversation.

MUSEUM LEADERS TO GET EYEFUL OF L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
ART: ON ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY, THE COMITE INTERNATIONAL POUR LES MUSEES D'ART 
MODERNE HAS BYPASSED NEW YORK TO CONVENE IN SANTA MONICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 24 years, the International Committee for Modern Art Museums has met 
annually throughout Europe. The group of museum directors and other leaders in 
the field of modern and contemporary art has convened in Amsterdam, Helsinki 
and Dubrovnik. Committee members have pondered museum issues in Lisbon, 
Dusseldorf, Paris and London. One year, they ventured across the Atlantic Ocean 
to Buenos Aires. But not once have they met in the United States, even though 
about 10% of the organization's 275 members are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as the committee marks its 25th birthday, the group will not only 
come to the United States, it will bypass New York and convene in Los Angeles. 
CIMAM (the acronym for Comite International Pour les Musees d'Art Moderne) will 
hold its 1990 conference today through next Saturday at Loew's Hotel in Santa 
Monica. Participants will attend lecture sessions at the hotel and visit 
Southern California museums and collections. 
</P>
<P>
Why are they finally coming here? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I have nagged them for three years," said Lyn Kienholz, director of 
the Los Angeles-based California/International Arts Foundation. "I was invited 
to join the organization about 6 1/2 years ago, and I couldn't understand why 
they hadn't met here." Kienholz's foundation, which organizes international art 
exchanges, is facilitating the conference with a committee of Southern 
California museum directors. 
</P>
<P>
Kienholz has had close ties to the European art community for nearly three 
decades, but she said that her dealings with Europeans revealed a persistently 
disappointing perception of Los Angeles. "I kept hearing that nothing of 
interest happened in Los Angeles and that no good art was produced here," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Pontus Hulten as the first director of Los Angeles 
Contemporary Museum of Art in 1980 turned the tide, Kienholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hulten, the founding director of Paris' immensely popular Georges Pompidou 
Center, left MOCA in 1982, but the idea that Los Angeles was becoming an 
exciting art center had caught hold in Europe, she said. The notion gained 
substance when MOCA got its program rolling and opened its new building on 
Grand Avenue, the L.A. County Museum of Art built a new wing for modern and 
contemporary art, and the gallery scene boomed in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Conference participants who partake in all scheduled events will be busy 
visiting Watts Towers and a host of museums and collections, including an 
all-day trip to Santa Barbara and another to Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. 
Tonight's inaugural event is the opening of the exhibition "Lee Miller: 
Photographer" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
CIMAM members will also attend lecture sessions on weighty topics. The opening 
program, on Monday morning, is dedicated to "Perspectives on the State of 
Culture at the End of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday morning's session on "Realities of the California Scene," video 
artist Bill Viola will talk about California art and artists, art consultant 
Tamara Thomas will discuss corporate collections and Henry Hopkins, director of 
the Frederick Weisman Art Foundation, will speak about Southern California 
museums. Additionally, Thomas Hines will deliver a lecture, "Los Angeles 
Architecture: The Issue of Tradition in a 20th-Century City." 
</P>
<P>
A Thursday morning session on "Enlightened Sponsorship," featuring speakers 
from Citicorp, the Rockefeller Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust, will 
introduce Europeans to American practices of private support for the arts. The 
final session, on Friday morning, will be a round-table discussion on "Present 
Day Developments" with curators and directors of private museums, galleries, 
foundations and study centers. 
</P>
<P>
Following the conference, one group of participants will visit San Francisco 
and about 20 others will accompany Kienholz on a five-day trek through the 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four CIMAM members have registered so far, the largest attendance in the 
organization's history, Kienholz said. About half the participants are from 
Western Europe, two dozen live in the Americas or the Caribbean, and the rest 
hail from Japan, the Soviet Union, Israel, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and 
Australia. Most of the foreign participants have never visited the West Coast, 
Kienholz said. 
</P>
<P>
CIMAM board members planned the lecture sessions, while Kienholz and her Los 
Angeles committee have organized housing, transportation, hospitality, art 
tours and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Conference costs, totaling about $200,000, have been offset by contributions of 
money and services from corporations and foundations. The Rockefeller 
Foundation provided $60,000 to bring participants from developing nations to 
Los Angeles. The J. Paul Getty Trust contributed $24,700 to transport CIMAM 
members from East Bloc countries. Other sponsors include Citicorp, the City of 
Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and Pacific Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
During nine years of work with the California/International Arts Foundation, 
Kienholz has become accustomed to the complications of international projects. 
She organized a show of California sculpture that opened at the 1984 Olympic 
Arts Festival and toured Europe, and she coordinated an exchange of donated 
artworks between the Museum Stuki in Lodz, Poland and the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art. She has also produced a film, "A Good Time to Be West," on 
sculptors from California.

 Dang Nhat Minh's "When the Tenth Month Comes" (1984) is a film of pastoral 
beauty, great sensitivity and subtlety. In a rural village, a young wife 
conceals the news of her husband's death in battle from her elderly, ailing 
father-in-law with the help of letters written in the dead man's name by the 
local schoolteacher who, in fact, falls in love with her. Their ensuing, chaste 
friendship, subject to gossip and criticism, gives way to the larger issue of 
how to honor the war dead: Shall the wife mourn her loss, even after her 
father-in-law's death, or has she the right to start a new life for herself?

The Principal Enemy 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at 3 p.m. at Melnitz Theater, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Shot while Bolivian director Jorge Sanjines was in political exile in Peru, 
and set in a mountain Indian community, this is a fierce mixture of balladlike 
epic and Marxist agitprop. The story is fairly simple-minded, rolling along in 
classic action-reaction structure. 
</P>
<P>
A vile landowner and his brutal overseer steal a peasant's only cow and then 
behead him; the peasantry rise up and arrest the landowner; a corrupt 
magistrate frees him and throws the peasantry in jail; saintly guerrillas bring 
the killers before a revolutionary tribunal, etc. etc., right up to the 
entrance of American military advisers. (The Principal Enemy?) The characters 
are stock villains and mass heroes, the dialogue almost wholly stiff and 
expository. Yet Sanjines is a poet of sorts. His monochrome landscapes have raw 
beauty; his violently moralistic tale is done without apology or compromise. It 
packs a punch. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Blood of the Condor 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at 8 p.m., Melnitz Theater, UCLA; Sept. 14 at 8 p.m. at AFI, 2021 N. 
Western Ave., Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Reminiscent of "The Bicycle Thief" in both style and structure, Bolivian 
filmmaker Jorge Sanjines' "Blood of the Condor" protests the genocide of the 
Quechua Indians through a sterilization program administered by the U.S. 
"Progress Corps" (read Peace Corps). Its depiction of the dark, irresponsible 
side of birth control is shattering in its effect -- especially upon anyone 
fervently convinced that curbs on population growth are essential to human 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The stark drama turns upon a Quechuan man who seeks revenge against the 
Americans for sterilizing his wife. Throughout, Sanjines matches his red-hot 
anger with a fully controlled artless-seeming style and handles 
nonprofessionals with the skill of a De Sica. KEVIN THOMAS

The Abandoned Field -- Free Fire Zone 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam 
</P>
<P>
 Airs tonight at 10:30 on KCET-TV; screens Monday at 6 p.m., Los Feliz Theater 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen Hong Sen's lyrical "The Abandoned Field -- Free Fire Zone" (1979) tells 
of a young couple with a baby who live in a simple hut built on the edge of a 
vast marsh. Our first impression is that the couple are living an idyllic 
existence in a beautiful Garden of Edenlike setting. 
</P>
<P>
But this is quickly dispelled as we discover that U.S. helicopters constantly 
attack the area, attempt to turn it into a no-man's land in preparation for an 
assault on the Mekong Delta. The couple, in turn, serve as liaisons for the 
Viet Cong, which allows us to see just how ingenious and implacable guerrilla 
warfare can be. KEVIN THOMAS

CABARET REVIEW;

SERIOUS SINGING FROM REESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's never much doubt about what to expect when Della Reese hits the stage. 
Powerful singing, whimsical humor and no-nonsense entertaining are her stocks 
in trade. 
</P>
<P>
The opening-night set in the Cabaret Room at the Improv was a typical example 
of the Reese performance magic. Never one to waste time or mince words, she 
steamed into the room with the imposing presence of a musical grande dame. 
Moving easily and quickly through several opening numbers, she tossed off a few 
jokes and established a solid interaction with her audience before finally 
getting down to the serious work of a beautifully crafted, multi-tempoed 
reading of "Just One of Those Things." 
</P>
<P>
Reese's voice, always a richly resonant instrument, has moved into the low 
tenor range in recent years, but her characteristic warmth and precision were 
as good as ever. Virtually every note she sang Wednesday night was right smack 
in the middle of the pitch, with lyrics that were as clear, concise and 
passionately articulated as a preacher's sermon. 
</P>
<P>
Reese wisely balanced her program with new and old material. She was crisply 
rhythmic on "Just the Two of Us" and surprisingly tender on "Until It's Time 
for You to Go." A collection of her old hits was on target, and her precise 
style sounded just right for John Benson Brooks' rhythm standard, "You Came a 
Long Way From St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to bring another singer -- William Knight -- on stage for several 
closing duets, however, seemed less wise. Knight's soft and mellow romanticism, 
pleasant as it was, provided an oddly jarring contrast to Reese's upfront, 
declamatory style. She would do well to consider climaxing her set with her own 
strong skills. 
</P>
<P>
Reese continues at the Cabaret Room at the Improv through Sept. 15. DON HECKMAN

News of the Bush-Gorbachev summit in Finland and the tense situation in the 
Persian Gulf is likely to overshadow everything else this weekend -- even the 
kickoff of the pro football season, the finals of the U.S. Open tennis 
tournament and the debuts of several new entertainment shows. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the season premiere of "NFL Live" Sunday, for example, NBC will 
broadcast 4 1/2 hours of live news from the summit, beginning at 5 a.m. ABC, 
CBS and CNN will also provide extensive coverage of the meetings in Helsinki 
all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
NBC (4)(36)(39) debuts "The Fanelli Boys," a new sitcom about an Italian 
family, tonight at 9:30 p.m. (The show will air regularly this season on 
Wednesdays at 9 p.m.) Following at 10 p.m., Gary Collins hosts the "Miss 
America Pageant." 
</P>
<P>
Fox counters at 10 p.m. tonight with the Mardi Gras premiere of Mark Frost's 
and David Lynch's new documentary series, "American Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, "The Late Mr. Pete Show," once an outrageous Westside public access 
cable talk show, moves to broadcast television on Channel 5 at 11:30 p.m. Mr. 
Pete (Peter Chaconas), the flamboyant host who habitually sports a hideous 
plaid red jacket, is nothing if he is not one zany guy. Martin Mull guests.

The start of the National Football League regular season, several attractive 
college football games and the men's and women's finals at tennis's U.S. Open 
are among the weekend's sports television viewing choices. However, the 
Dodgers' last gasp effort to stay in the National League West race will not be 
seen on any Southland viewing screens. 
</P>
<P>
The injury-weakened Rams open play Sunday against the Green Bay Packers with 
KCBS Channel 2 and KFMB Channel 8 airing the game at 10 a.m. Because the 
Raiders have decided to stay in Los Angeles for now, only one other NFL game 
can come into Los Angeles on network television Sunday, with KNBC Channel 4 
opting to air the Pittsburgh Steelers-Cleveland Browns matchup at 1 p.m. 
Cable's Turner Network Television begins its NFL regular season coverage with 
the New York Giants playing host to the Philadelphia Eagles at 5 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
College football's game of the day matches defending national champion and No. 
1 ranked Miami (Fla.) and No. 16 Brigham Young at 4:30 p.m. today on ESPN. No. 
19 UCLA opens its season against No. 23 Oklahoma at 12:30 p.m. today on 
Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
Russell White, a prep standout at Encino Crespi High School, is expected to 
make his collegiate debut today when California visits Wisconsin, 9:30 a.m. 
ESPN. White, forced to sit out his freshman year after failing to meet the 
NCAA's Proposition 48 academic standards, is second on the Bears' depth chart 
at tailback and will return kickoffs.

Boris Becker meets Andre Agassi in a men's semifinal match as coverage of 
tennis's U.S. Open begins at 8 a.m. today on KCBS Channel 2 and KFMB Channel 8. 
The women's singles finals follows with the John McEnroe-Pete Sampras semifinal 
concluding the day's action. The same stations will air the men's singles final 
at 1 p.m. Sunday.

SportsChannel televised Friday night's series opener between the Dodgers and 
division-leading Cincinnati Reds, but will not air games today or Sunday.

"The baseball schedule we lay out is done in November," explained Rockey 
Flintermann, SportsChannel's director of programming and network operations. 
"When we sat down in November, we thought San Diego and San Francisco would be 
contending for the pennant. We have three telecasts against San Diego left and 
one with San Francisco. Cincinnati comes as a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Flintermann also said he was reluctant to change his schedule out of fairness 
to fans who had purchased tickets after consulting the television schedule.

The truly converted show their faith with their hearts, souls and pocketbooks, 
declared the president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc., during 
the black denomination's annual meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Say what you will, but the best thermometer (to measure) black Baptists is 
what they give," said the Rev. Theodore J. Jemison, who would soon cajole 
10,000 delegates for donations at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jemison, a Louisiana pastor, was seeking funds to reduce the $7-million debt on 
a $10-million Baptist World Center dedicated last year in Nashville. Before the 
five-day, 110th annual meeting ends Sunday, officials hope to have collected $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Money is crucial at this point, a critical juncture for the denomination, which 
is trying to live up to its numbers as the nation's largest black church body 
and the third-largest Protestant denomination at 7.8 million members and more 
than 30,000 churches. 
</P>
<P>
Jemison was elected president in 1982 as a relatively progressive pastor, 
succeeding Chicago pastor Joseph H. Jackson, whose 28 socially conservative 
years in the post were marked by the departure in the early 1960s of the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and others who wanted to move faster on civil rights. 
Jackson, now deceased, ran the skeletal denomination "from his hip pocket" as a 
personal possession, critics said when he was deposed. 
</P>
<P>
Jemison quickly restored the denomination's participation in the National 
Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, sought to broaden its 
missionary and educational programs and make its annual meetings more than 
preaching, singing and socializing. He wanted to have a headquarters building 
for the first time -- the kind of facility that predominantly white 
denominations take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
The center, with its 162-foot spire and 3,000-seat auditorium, was dedicated in 
ceremonies 15 months ago on a Nashville hillside that cost an additional $2 
million. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a National Baptist clergyman, stood at his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The building has been criticized by some black church specialists at divinity 
schools as an extravagant monument to Jemison at a time when they say the money 
could be better spent to fight drug and crime problems in their own 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Franklyn Richardson of Mt. Vernon, N.Y., general secretary of the 
National Baptists, said the headquarters has symbolic importance as a mecca for 
black Baptists and will serve practical needs. "Every department will have 
offices there eventually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson contended that the only criticism of the World Baptist Center is 
coming from outside the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Undeniably, within the National Baptist Convention, for all of Jemison's 
progressive changes, the traditional deference shown to the denomination 
president was evident at the convention's opening session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to do all we can to please our president . . . even pamper him," said 
the Rev. Manuel Scott Sr., a Dallas pastor formerly of Los Angeles. Another 
pastor, whose church has given generously to the denomination, said it was "a 
joy to be under such a great, great leader." Yet another said admiringly, 
"Nobody can beat him raising money." 
</P>
<P>
Jemison has made it clear that making only token contributions to the national 
church agencies, in spite of the traditional Baptist emphasis on the local 
church regardless of denomination, is unacceptable. Jemison once publicly 
chided an unnamed California pastor for giving only $50 a year to the national 
church even as he received a $40,000 gift from his congregation. "You can give 
$50 and see a chicken fight," Jemison said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the denomination only receives between $20 million and $25 
million annually for its various national organizations and agencies. The 
predominantly white Southern Baptist Convention -- nearly twice the size of the 
National Baptist Convention in membership -- has budgets totaling $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
The National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., officially organized in 1895, 
dates its origin from an 1880 meeting in Montgomery, Ala., of black Baptists, 
most of them ex-slaves, who had been involved in missionary work to Africa. 
Later disputes spawned two major breakaways -- to form the National Baptist 
Convention of America in 1915 and the Progressive National Baptist Convention 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, Richardson said that black Baptist denominational differences 
are inconsequential. In addition, many black congregations are dually aligned 
with a black convention and one of the largely white denominations such as the 
American Baptist Churches of America or the Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
As secular U.S. institutions integrated in the 1960s and 1970s, American and 
Southern Baptist churches sought to increase their black membership. Yet, black 
Baptists churches with their distinctive preaching, music and culture are still 
central to many black communities -- much as black Methodist denominations have 
not been supplanted by the larger United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
"Black churches are still a force for order in black families and communities," 
said H.A. Wiltshire of Long Beach, editor of The Baptist Journal, a monthly 
magazine scheduled to debut next month. "I shudder to think what would happen 
in urban neighborhoods without the black churches and their social services." 
</P>
<P>
Jemison made news this week with mild criticism of the American military 
deployment of troops to the Persian Gulf. He said he backed President Bush's 
decision "as the right thing" on a practical basis, but he also said he was 
against any military action "over the issue of oil." 
</P>
<P>
But his stance was partly a lament over how suddenly the Bush Administration 
spent $1 billion for military moves while pleading poverty when faced with 
domestic urban problems. "Think of the good that the billion dollars could do 
for black America and poor white America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. E. V. Hill of Los Angeles, a National Baptist vice president, said 
denomination leaders are not opposing the Bush Administration. The National 
Baptists have a patriotic flavor reflected in the opening ceremony for this 
week's convention that began with reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of either/or, but we think the United States should come 
up with the money for both (the international and domestic crises)," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor of Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church in South-Central Los Angeles, Hill 
is an energetic minister in tackling community problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't think a black congregation could come up with the money, but 
somehow we manage to feed 4,000 people a week," he said. Likewise, Hill 
asserted, if the U.S. government were really committed to reducing poverty and 
homelessness, it could also find the funds.

DELUMEAU'S 'SIN AND FEAR' LOOKS AT GUILT AS SEEN IN 15TH CENTURY; 
</P>
<P>
SIN AND FEAR: THE EMERGENCE OF A WESTERN GUILT CULTURE, 13TH-18TH CENTURIES BY 
JEAN DELUMEAU, TRANSLATED BY ERIC NICHOLSON; ST. MARTIN'S PRESS; 39.95; 677 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM GRIFFIN, Griffin, a novelist and biographer, covers the religious 
publishing scene for Publisher's Weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the dust jacket of "Sin and Fear" is a detail of the Bosch painting in which 
men and women in their baptismal suits are disporting themselves about a garden 
of earthly delights. Whether the ladies and gentlemen are enjoying lust, or 
just a bit of artistic luck, is not quite clear, but it does serve as an 
appropriate introduction to sin and fear and guilt, at least in the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
In the inside back flap of the book's dust jacket, author Jean Delumeau is 
identified only as a professor of history at the College de France, Paris. 
According to the translator, this is the second volume of a tetralogy, but only 
the first to appear in English. The first book deals with fear in the West, and 
the last with a history of Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes before or after, the present volume divines, among the medieval 
and Renaissance kings and clergy, "a propensity to sensationalize the message 
of Holy Scripture," and the author asks why these potentates did it. 
</P>
<P>
"This book has attempted to answer this enormous question," he writes, "by 
considering sin as a 'historical object.' It was, I believe, a new enterprise 
to undertake a cultural history of sin in the West." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Delumeau's work is a sort of tour de force through the Museum of 
Spiritual History (my metaphor, not the author's), wherein one can see "more 
than 600 years of guilt-instilling efforts." Leading the tour is Delumeau, 
acting as a sort of historical curator. 
</P>
<P>
In the first hall of the ground floor, one sees various manifestations of 
"contemptus mundi," a once-useful ascetical concept of amazing plasticity; in a 
thousand forms it relentlessly urged the denial of all earthly enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In the next hall is "Danse Macabre," the image of death that was rendered so 
imaginatively, if grotesquely, adding a little Fred and Ginger to the otherwise 
dull sermon, the otherwise static painting. 
</P>
<P>
On the second floor in an exhibit entitled "A Failure of Redemption?" Delumeau 
presents the examination of conscience, the practice if not the sacrament of 
penance, the concept if not the doctrine of original sin, the relative paucity 
of the saved; under "Religious Uneasiness," he dazzlingly displays the doctrine 
of pain, the disease of scruple, the difficulty of death. 
</P>
<P>
On the third floor, where the placard reads "An Evangelism of Fear," he details 
sermons and hymns, the tortures of the afterlife, the judgment or vengeance of 
a "lynx-eyed" God, the classifications of sins as mortal and venial, and the 
ascetic model, the svelte ideal. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic world comes in for a lot of corporal punishment at the hands of 
the historical curator, but the Protestant world also suffers from his lash, 
especially because of its emphasis on eschatology and predestination. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that there was so much sin in the centuries covered by the book, the 
author seems to argue, as that there was not enough forgiveness. "A pessimistic 
brand of preaching" and "a series of vast collective disasters that besieged 
Europeans" seemed to have fueled the imaginations of princes and priests. 
</P>
<P>
When the 18th Century began to alleviate the "serious threats to daily life," 
however, such persuasion as the politicians and preachers possessed began to 
erode. Sin and fear began to disappear. Guilt too has been evanescing, but 
seemingly at a far slower rate. 
</P>
<P>
Delumeau's perceptions are not without spiritual perspective: "I think that sin 
exists," he confesses. "I feel its presence in me. Furthermore, I cannot see 
how one can eliminate the idea of an Original Sin, whose scars we still bear. 
</P>
<P>
"Freud felt this and tried to explain it, while both Bergson and Gouhier 
observed that 'everything happens as if there were an original defect in man.' 
</P>
<P>
"My book must therefore not be taken either as a refusal of guilt or the need 
for a consciousness of sin. On the contrary, I think it will shed light on the 
excessive sense of guilt and 'culpabilization' . . . that has characterized 
Western history." 
</P>
<P>
A most amusing afternoon, with vivid memories of the Black Death and the Wars 
of Religion. Out into the sunlight again. I can't remember when I enjoyed sin 
and fear more. 
</P>
<P>
But if I were to reread the book, re-enter the museum, as it were, and take the 
tour through the same materials, this time accompanied by the spiritual 
curator, the effect might be quite different. He would propose that what 
appears to be historical artifact may be as alive today as it was centuries 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Are those Rodinesque figures of "Lust" and "Sloth" really made of stone, he 
would ask, or are they Marceau-like mimes, motionless as one approaches, but 
after one passes, pouncing on one's very back and clawing at one's very 
existence? 
</P>
<P>
"Sin and Fear" is full of pleasures and delights, but not for everyone who has 
suffered at the hands of theologically manipulated sin and fear, who has been 
ground down by clerically originated guilt. It is certainly for those who like 
to rummage around the European centuries, especially from the 13th to the 18th.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
HARD ACT TO FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt, there are many in Dr. Howard Fishbein's generation who have found 
themselves singing along with the Rolling Stones while driving down the 
freeway. Few have gone beyond mere imagination to experience what this Orange 
County family doctor and some fellow musicians did last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In the ultimate 1960s fantasy come true, Dr. Rock, Fishbein's rock group, 
performed at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre before about 900 friends, colleagues 
and patients. It was a present for Fishbein's 39th birthday arranged by his 
wife, who said that her husband was approaching 40-something with great 
trepidation and that performing on stage was something he wanted "more than 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the group members seemed to walk right out of the cast of "The Big 
Chill": Dr. Rock's 43-year-old drummer is a podiatrist who wondered before the 
concert whether he'd be called up in the Army Reserves; the group's lead 
guitarist and sax player is a 39-year-old graphic artist; the rhythm guitarist 
is 40 and a project administrator for an engineering company. 
</P>
<P>
A dream come true, guys? "It's only for tonight," one of them said. "We turn 
back into pumpkins tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Well, this Cinderella story hardly would have been complete without the right 
encore. What better choice for the yelling crowd than the Stones' "You Can't 
Always Get What You Want"? It was a reminder that even if not all baby-boomers 
grew up to be rock stars, they could, to paraphrase Mick Jagger, at least get 
what they need.

EMOTION, PUNT BLOCKS CARRY OILERS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: HUNTINGTON BEACH ROLLS PAST CORONA DEL MAR, 28-0, IN SEASON 
OPENER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach High School's football team never lacked for emotion in its 
28-0 season-opening victory over Corona del Mar Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 2,000 at Orange Coast College watched Huntington Beach block and 
tackle better than Corona del Mar. The Oilers also ran and passed more 
successfully. And they even looked better running through the paper banners the 
cheerleaders held at the beginning of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' emotion carried them to their first victory in more than a season. 
Huntington Beach had an 8-2 record last season on the field, but lost a bitter 
fight in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset League principals ruled that the Oilers had to forfeit all eight 
victories, a share of the league championship and a berth in the playoffs last 
season for using an ineligible player in all 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach was granted an injunction against the ruling, putting the team 
back into the playoffs. But two days later, the injunction was overturned and 
the Oilers were out of the playoffs once again. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this game real bad," said James Marietti, a Huntington Beach running 
back/defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
It showed. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers sputtered early, perhaps trying a little too hard. But by halftime, 
Huntington Beach had the game won. 
</P>
<P>
Marietti blocked two punts by Matt Evans, Corona del Mar's sophomore punter, in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The first was scooped up at the Sea Kings' 14-yard line by Gabe Houston, who 
returned it to the two. Houston then ran two yards for the Oilers' first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored again on their next possession -- a 54-yard pass play from 
Mike Chavira, one of two quarterbacks who played for Huntington Beach, to Joe 
Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
Marietti blocked Evans' punt on the Sea Kings' next series, returning it for a 
27-yard touchdown on the final play of the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had one punt blocked since I've been coaching here," said Dave 
Holland, in his 17th season as Corona del Mar coach. "Tonight we had two." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach added an 18-yard touchdown pass from Chavira to Gabe Stupin 
with 6 minutes 21 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar came close to scoring only in the waning minutes, but its drive 
stalled at the Huntington Beach two with two second left. 
</P>
<P>
Until that final drive, the Sea Kings had 36 yards passing. And until that 
final drive, the biggest gain for the Sea King was a 12-yard pass from 
quarterback Todd Kehrli to running back Jason Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's defense also stopped Corona del Mar's rushing game. The Sea 
Kings had six yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers passed for 165 yards and ran for 157.

FOOTHILL COMES UP DRY AGAINST TUSTIN

<TEXT>
<P>
There was little Tustin High School could do wrong Friday night. Oh, there was 
a botched drive and a couple of poorly thrown passes. There may even have been 
a few missed assignments. 
</P>
<P>
But the few things that did go wrong for the Tillers didn't seem to matter. 
Tustin had far too much for Foothill High to handle -- too much speed, size and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Almost methodically, the Tillers overpowered the Knights, 20-0, in front of 
2,000 fans at Tustin High School. It was the second victory of the season for 
the Tillers, who defeated Honolulu Pac-5, 37-7, last week in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that we might have left our game on the islands," Tustin Coach 
Marijon Ancich said. "Foothill concerned me." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever worries or concerns Ancich had proved unfounded from the start. 
</P>
<P>
On its first drive, Tustin drove 55 yards to the Foothill four-yard line. 
Although quarterback Andy Borza fumbled on third down, turning the ball over to 
the Knights, the drive proved the Foothill defense was superior up front. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin offensive line, which returned three starters from last season, 
created gaping holes for running backs Ron Goods and Visko Ancich. 
</P>
<P>
Goods was especially effective, gaining 125 yards in 20 carries. In a 
spectacular 17-yard run, he dodged five would-be tacklers to set up a 37-yard 
field goal by Matt Coo just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich finished with 41 yards, including touchdown runs of two and five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin finished with 190 yards rushing and 246 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised how well we controlled the line of scrimmage," Ancich said. 
"Foothill has a good line and they always seem to give us trouble. But I felt 
we dominated the front tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin defense also owned the line of scrimmage. The Tillers decimated the 
Foothill offense, allowing the Knights only 75 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Sean Saunders, who gained 846 yards last season, was held to 28 yards 
in 11 carries. Saunders had only one carry for more than four yards, his last 
one when he gained 14 yards with 10 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to contain Saunders," Ancich said. "He was the one guy who 
could really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
With Saunders locked up, Foothill's offense fell apart. In fact, the Knights 
got into Tustin territory only once, driving to the 16 before being pushed 
back, thanks to defensive tackle Efriam Miranda. On first down, he tackled 
quarterback Evan Lang for a seven-yard loss. On second down, he chased down 
Saunders on a screen pass for a one-yard loss. And, on third down, he sacked 
Lang, forcing a fumble that was recovered by Scott Stirnaman. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda finished with two sacks in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' defense kept them close through most of the third quarter. Tustin, 
which led, 10-0, took a 13-0 lead on a 21-yard field goal by Coo with less than 
two minutes left in the third quarter.

WILSON'S TAILBACK TAKES CONTROL TO RUN PAST SERVITE

Maybe it's still too early for football. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first half Friday night at Cerritos College, it looked as if 
the players' minds were on baseball -- after two quarters, the score was 
Servite High School 3 and visiting Long Beach Wilson 2. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, it was the best player on the field -- Wilson tailback Mike Steward 
-- who took control of the game in the second half. Steward's run on a 
fourth-quarter fake punt gave Wilson a 14-12 victory in front of 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
"Steward is a very good football player," Servite Coach Larry Toner said 
afterward. "He was like a man among boys out there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Steward helped cut into a 10-2 Servite lead on the first play of the final 
quarter when he took a handoff to the left, cut back across midfield, then 
sprinted past the Servite defense for a 25-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
The next Wilson drive stalled at the Servite 36-yard line. But with 5 minutes 
11 seconds left, on fourth and 16, Wilson Coach John Brennan crossed everyone 
up when he called for the fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was snapped to the up-back, Brian Poyer, who handed off to Steward on 
a reverse. Steward did the rest, accelerating down the left sideline and 
outrunning Servite's Billy Ray to the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still learning," Toner said. "When we get snookered like that on a fake 
punt on fourth down, we've obviously got some coaching errors to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
Especially tailback Chandler Robbins (107 yards on 13 carries), who broke a 
series of tackles to bust loose along the left sideline for a 57-yard 
third-quarter gain. That set up Mike Wallock's two-yard touchdown dive on the 
next play, giving Servite the 10-2 lead.

Pacifica High School emerged from Friday night's penalty-plagued season- opener 
with a 28-10 non-league victory over visiting Woodbridge at Bolsa Grande High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The defending Garden Grove League champions took advantage of the penalty- and 
turnover-ridden Warriors, who are moving from the Pacific Coast League to the 
Sea View League this season. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge was penalized 15 times for 146 yards and committed three costly 
turnovers to help seal its fate. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica's first-quarter touchdown, a nine-yard pass from Chris Castellano to 
Dave Anderson, was aided by 40 yards in penalties. Mariner safety Rich Main, 
who also had two sacks and returned an intercepted pass 30 yards for a 
fourth-quarter touchdown, stopped Woodbridge's ensuing drive to the Mariner 
eight-yard line by recovering wide receiver Miguel Morales' fumble of a 19-yard 
pass from quarterback James Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica pulled away from a 7-3 halftime lead on a 25-yard touchdown pass from 
Castellano to Scott Lesser and a 61-yard fumble recovery return by Chris 
Maroney in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge scored its only touchdown in a fourth-quarter, 94-yard drive capped 
by Nathaniel Haugh's one-yard plunge. Brian Nurick kicked the conversion to go 
with his 23-yard, second-quarter field goal. TOM BIRSCHBACH

LOS ALAMITOS' LATE SURGE OVERCOMES MARINA, 7-3

The legend has gone, but the understudy is filling in admirably. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gragnano, who quarterbacked Los Alamitos High School to three straight 
Empire League championships, is now at the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
But senior quarterback John Collins learned enough in three years to hit Tyler 
Cashman with a 29-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, giving Los 
Alamitos a 7-3 victory over host Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's a good friend of mine," Collins said, "so I've been around him, and 
when I get out there, I think, 'I gotta do what he did.' Although I know my 
limitations, I have high expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Collins completed 14 of 23 passes for 158 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With Marina leading, 3-0, in the fourth quarter, Collins lofted a wobbly pass 
to Cashman for the only touchdown of the game, and Eric Wallace kicked the 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's No. 1 fullback, Shawn Fulford, carried the ball more times for more 
yards -- 26 for 113 -- than the entire Los Alamitos team (13 for 65). 
</P>
<P>
Fulford's two-yard apparent touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a 
penalty, and Dan Armstrong gave Marina the early lead with a 28-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes was not satisfied. HEATHER SMALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
After a sluggish first quarter, Dana Hills High School dominated Fountain 
Valley en route to a 27-6 victory Friday night at Spencer Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins got two rushing touchdowns in both the second and fourth quarters, 
and outgained the Barons in total offense, 267-75, in the final three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley scored on the game's first possession on quarterback Marcos 
Diaz's four-yard touchdown pass to David Dardis. From that point, however, Dana 
Hills controlled the game. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Jenkins put the Dolphins on the board with a 26-yard touchdown run with 
3:52 left to play in the first half, and John Ashley's extra point gave Dana 
Hills the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills' Shaun Coleman scored the first of his two touchdowns on a one-yard 
run with four seconds to go in the second quarter. The touchdown was set up by 
Marcelle Franklin's 30-yard gain on a screen pass from Albie Sukut with 16 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman scored again from a yard out early in the fourth quarter to give Dana 
Hills a 20-6 lead. Scott Duster completed the scoring with a 47-yard end run 
with 3:46 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
After the first quarter, Diaz was 3 for 15 and finished 7 for 20 for 95 yards 
and the touchdown. Franklin led Dana Hills with 58 yards on 13 carries.

<P>
Randy Karliner, after being knocked out on Ocean View's previous series, came 
back to throw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Al Cano in the corner of the end zone 
with 1:09 left in the game to knock Saddleback out of the lead, and Ron 
Lightner's extra point gave Ocean View a 14-13 victory Friday night at 
Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's hopes for victory appeared to dim when Karliner was knocked to the 
ground by Hernan DeSantos while lunging for a first down on a fourth-down 
scramble. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner fell two yards short, giving Saddleback the ball on its 30 with 3:56 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawk defense forced Saddleback to punt after three plays and, after 
Dennis Eichen's 29-yard return, Ocean View had a first down at the Roadrunners' 
36. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes was all Karliner needed to catch his breath. After an incompletion, 
the 6-2 senior hit Jeff Bush on a crossing pattern for 22 yards and then 
drilled the ball to Cano to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (0-1) scored first when DeSantos capped a 63-yard, 14-play drive by 
diving over from the one. DeSantos added the extra point and the Roadrunners 
led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (1-0) answered on its next possession when Karliner threw 47 yards 
to Bush to cap a three-play, 67-yard drive. Lightner hit the extra point and 
the score was 7-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After Saddleback received the second-half kick, Paul Delgado capped a 79-yard 
drive with a 31-yard pass to Robert Reyes. The extra point failed after the 
Roadrunners were assessed a 15-yard personal-foul penalty. That made the extra 
point a 28-yard effort that DeSantos missed wide right.

<P>
After a half of big plays and another of botched plays, Santa Ana Valley and 
Corona high schools fought to a 14-14 tie Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
All of the scoring came in the first half, when Corona took a 14-0 lead 
courtesy of a pair of touchdown receptions by Doug McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel's second score came on a 68-yard pass play from quarterback Steve 
Bernier with 4 minutes 13 seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, Santa Ana Valley's James Barclay fumbled, picked up the 
ball at the eight-yard line and bolted 92 yards for the Falcons' first score. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley tied the score on a one-yard quarterback sneak by Gary Graves, 
following a 46-yard pass to Mike Castleberry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, both teams fumbled once inside their opponent's 10-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"We had this game, but we made a couple of key mistakes, like that fumble," 
Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona Coach Stu Horn echoed Castanon's feelings, adding, "Valley is so 
explosive, they can hit you with a big play any time." 
</P>
<P>
Corona could have attempted a 52-yard field goal with five seconds remaining in 
the game, but the Panthers went for a touchdown. Castleberry sacked Bernier at 
the 40-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we didn't go for the field goal was that I didn't want to give 
Valley the ball for even one second," Horn said.

MODERN DANCE PERFORMANCES USHER IN COLLEGE'S ART SEASON

<P>
Palomar College will kick off its performing arts season tonight with a concert 
that reflects a vision to expand the dance experience on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The three performances will feature a split bill that includes Gloria Newman 
Dance Theatre (an Orange County-based modern dance troupe) as well as the 
familiar faculty dancers on the Palomar staff. Performances are scheduled for 
7:30 p.m. today and 3 and 7:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we're inviting a professional dance company to perform 
with us," said Dorothie Bleth of the dance department. "Whenever we can, we'd 
like to have more school-sponsored professional dance. This time it's modern, 
and we'll have four members of the modern dance faculty perform with the 
company. But, in the future, we hope to do it with jazz and ballet, too." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to share with our students in North County various points 
of view in modern dance," said Jacqueline Weiss, a soloist on the faculty 
portion of the concert. "We'd like to invite other companies -- especially when 
we've had some ties with them, like this one." 
</P>
<P>
Bleth studied with Newman several years ago and is the faculty link with 
Newman's dance troupe. Company dancer Karol Lee teaches at nearby MiraCosta 
College. But it is Newman's complementary choreographic focus that appealed the 
most to the Palomar faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a view of modern dance that we haven't seen in San Diego," Weiss said. 
"The issues the company addresses are either dramatic or very contemporary, and 
we want to expose our students to as many styles of dance as we possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what modern dance is all about," Newman said by phone from her studio. 
"We've been around 25 years, but we have never performed in the San Diego area 
before. I'm going to home in on a different vocabulary for this performance -- 
very contemporary, and very off-the-wall." 
</P>
<P>
Newman selected three of her dancers and excerpts from a full-evening work for 
this weekend's concert at Palomar College Theater. The zany bits and pieces 
will be a "dance of juxtapositions," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
When the faculty takes the limelight, Weiss will dance two solos -- a recent 
work by San Diego-based Mieczslaw Morawski and a new dance of her own design. 
Faith Jensen-Ismay, a Three's Company principal, will perform Jean Isaacs' "Red 
Dress," which was well-received at a recent company Lo-Tec concert. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mary Neuru will dance and choreograph, and Dana Dominic will present two 
group pieces.

BUTTE'S 'FISCAL CANCER' AFFLICTS OTHER COUNTIES 
</P>

<P>
As Butte County struggled through Friday on the brink of bankruptcy, state and 
local officials elsewhere warned that the county's threatened financial 
collapse is symptomatic of money problems facing counties throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Butte is just at the head of the line. At least a half-dozen other counties 
are just a step behind, with more behind them," said Assemblyman Stan Statham 
(R-Oak Run), who represents the county in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A new report by the County Supervisors Assn. of California, obtained Friday by 
The Times, identifies at least 18 California counties that it said were in 
various stages of financial distress. Of those studied, San Diego and Ventura 
were said to be the Southern California counties facing the biggest financial 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The report said, "The fiscal cancer that afflicts Butte County is present to 
some extent in all California counties." The report warned that "the gradual 
fiscal collapse of county government, given its present fiscal structure, is 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's fiscal woes have yet to bring it to the brink of collapse, but 
the county is faced with mounting financial problems that officials say will 
eventually cripple local programs unless the state steps in. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some of the effects of budget shortfalls are being felt: The county 
was forced to make sharp cutbacks in indigent medical care this year after the 
state reduced its support for the program. And many Orange County officials 
predict that the problem will be repeated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"You think this is bad, just wait till next year," Orange County Supervisor Don 
R. Roth said recently as the county board was considering its 1990-91 budget. 
"There's no relief in sight." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as most experts see it, is that the state and the courts are 
requiring counties to provide more health, welfare and other services than 
local tax bases -- or the governor and Legislature -- can support. 
</P>
<P>
Most deeply hurt are counties that had low tax rates when Proposition 13 was 
passed and have been unable to raise taxes to keep pace with rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
One such county, San Diego, "parallels Butte County in an alarming number of 
instances," the report said. The county has lost $76 million in tax revenue 
over the last five years because of cities incorporating or annexing county 
territory. Over the last five years, as taxes and fees were rising 66.8%, the 
report said, the cost of state-required programs was rising 90.5%. During the 
same period, San Diego County's welfare costs rose 284%. 
</P>
<P>
And while Ventura County now is relatively healthy compared to other counties, 
"there are storm clouds on the horizon," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It cited a budget analysis done at the beginning of the year projecting that 
spending will exceed tax revenues by almost $6 million in 1991-92 and $18 
million by 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
As for the more immediate problem facing Butte County, a once-sleepy farming 
region in the Sacramento Valley that is experiencing growing pains, officials 
said Friday that they would delay a decision on whether to become the first 
California county to file for bankruptcy, hoping to work out a bailout plan 
with Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian on Thursday rejected a $15-million financial aid package approved by 
the Legislature and offered his own scaled-down plan. County officials said the 
Deukmejian package would not be enough to keep the county afloat. But, after 
considering filing for bankruptcy Friday, county officials decided to try to 
work something out with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Emmett Pogue, deputy county administrative officer, said, "Bankruptcy is a 
last-resort-type step. There still are other doors open. So long as there are, 
we do not want to go through that last door." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in a letter to Ed McLaughlin, chairman of the Butte County Board of 
Supervisors, seemed to suggest that the county could weather the crisis with a 
bit of state financial aid and some belt-tightening. He did not address broader 
themes that county officials say are at the heart of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Among Deukmejian's suggestions were that the county forgo the purchase of a new 
fire engine to save $300,000, reduce the amount budgeted for county pay raises 
and leave unfilled all but 45 of the 183 new positions it hoped to create. 
Deukmejian, in addition, offered the county a grant of $700,000 and promised to 
waive or defer $5.1 million in obligations to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Statham, who carried the $15-million county aid plan in the Legislature, said 
he was so enraged by Deukmejian's response that he hoped the county would 
immediately file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
He called the governor's proposal "ridiculously inadequate," declaring that the 
benefits were mostly "funny money" in the form of letting Butte County off the 
hook from state obligations that it couldn't meet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor is basically hanging Butte County out to dry. It is outrageous 
that he cannot find a few million in the $55-billion state budget to stop a 
California county from going belly up," Statham said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian defended the plan after a speech to business leaders in Sacramento, 
telling reporters that it was "a responsible, good-faith proposal . . . 
recognizing that there's just so much that we can do for Butte County." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and experts who have studied county problems statewide say 
many of Butte County's problems are showing up in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Sparks, a consultant to the Assembly's Local Government Committee, 
acknowledged that Butte reached the point of bankruptcy faster than other 
counties. But, she said, "the same problems are there in other counties. They 
tend to show up first in a rural county because the tax base is smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is Proposition 13, which requires public votes on tax 
increases, rather than votes by local boards of supervisors as before 1978, 
county officials say. Butte County officials asked local voters in the June 
primary to approve four different taxes to finance the Fire Department, 
libraries and other services. Voters rejected them all. 
</P>
<P>
Also feeding the problem are state requirements that counties administer and 
partially pay for welfare programs. Costs of these programs are soaring. 
According to the county supervisors association report, some counties spend as 
much as 70% of their general-purpose tax dollars on state-required programs, 
leaving only 30% to support local programs, such as law enforcement, fire 
protection and public works. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, county officials say rural counties like Butte, where living costs 
are much lower than in the big cities, are a magnet for welfare recipients 
because people can stretch their grants much further. According to the report, 
the costs to Butte County for administering the Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children program rose 322% during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
At an Oroville mini-mart Friday, clerk Sue Thompson complained to a reporter: 
"We have to pay out too much money for state programs and there are a lot of 
people here on welfare. We've had people move here from Oregon just because of 
the welfare."

D.A. CAPIZZI'S PROSECUTORS TO AID CAMPAIGN; ENRIGHT ANGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright on Friday assailed his boss, Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, for using deputy prosecutors in a planned 
door-to-door campaign this weekend in the kickoff of their two-man race for the 
office's top seat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's highly, highly questionable," Enright said. "In this case, love and 
devotion (to the boss) looks more like retention and promotion." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors, however, say their efforts, which begin today, are strictly 
voluntary and that Capizzi had to be persuaded to let them help him. One leader 
of the Capizzi campaign, Fountain Valley attorney Bruce C. Bridgman, called 
Enright "a jerk" for trying to make it a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
The political jabs came on the eve of the beginning of Enright's and Capizzi's 
fall campaign for district attorney. Both candidates are longtime adversaries 
within the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, 63, a last-minute candidate for the district attorney's race in the 
June primary, surprised everyone by garnering enough votes in a four-man race 
to force Capizzi, the top vote-getter, into a Nov. 6 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, 50, responded on Friday that he has made it clear to all the office 
employees who volunteered -- nearly 75 prosecutors and almost that many 
investigators -- that there was no pressure to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people wanted to help, I finally decided it would be insensitive to 
their concerns for the future of the office not to let them get involved," 
Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
But Enright said prosecutors going door to door for the boss should not be 
acceptable to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"You wash the boss's car on Saturday and then the deputy sitting next to you 
says, 'Hmm, maybe he could use a wax job too,' " Enright said. "It is wrong for 
appearances. If the deputy who walks precincts gets promoted and the deputy who 
stays home doesn't, it's just very bad for the office." 
</P>
<P>
But one of the deputy prosecutors who volunteered, Guy N. Ormes, said Capizzi 
was reluctant to let them participate. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us wanted to help him out before (in the June primary), but Mike 
asked us not to," Ormes said. "We're going out there because we want to see him 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Prickett, another deputy prosecutor, said he feels no pressure at all to 
help Capizzi. "Just the opposite is true," he added. "Those of us who are going 
out there have had to take some razzing within the office about (currying favor 
with Capizzi). But (Capizzi) represents the values I believe a D.A. should 
have. Why shouldn't the public have a right to know?" 
</P>
<P>
Not all the deputy prosecutors volunteered. One, who asked not to be named, 
said he would never walk a precinct for either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a professional prosecutor," he said. "I'm here to do a job." 
</P>
<P>
And Tom Borris, a former prosecutor who recently left the district attorney's 
office, said at Enright's open house in Santa Ana on Friday night that he was 
offended when Bridgman called him and asked him if he wanted to walk precincts 
for Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it stinks," Borris said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgman said that he tried to contact only those deputy prosecutors who had 
indicated either to him or others that they wanted to help Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to do this without creating any friction within the office," Bridgman 
said. "We tried hard not to impact deputies not in the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, he deliberately did not ask any of the prosecutors who 
work on the homicide panel, because that has long been Enright's area within 
the office. Several homicide prosecutors contacted said they preferred to stay 
out of the race altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The Capizzi volunteers are scheduled to walk precincts throughout the county 
for the next nine weekends before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi added that he has stood firm by his decision before the June primary 
not to let any of his deputies make any financial contributions to his 
campaign. But Enright, Capizzi said, accepted a $1,000 contribution from 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
Enright responded that it's an unfair comparison, because he's not in charge of 
the office the way Capizzi is in charge of the deputies in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary, Enright had called Capizzi the "politician's candidate." 
Capizzi was appointed district attorney in January by the County Board of 
Supervisors when longtime Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks accepted a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Enright and his supporters claim that Hicks planned his early retirement from 
office in an effort to give Capizzi a leg up on the other candidates in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi chose not to respond to Enright in that campaign. But his failure to 
retain his seat outright in the June election may have forced some changes in 
campaign strategy. He switched political consultants, and decided on a 
door-to-door campaign instead of his June strategy of relying on mailers. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his campaign office this week, Capizzi said: "It's 
too easy to sit back and send mass mailers. We think political campaigns should 
be on a person-to-person basis." 
</P>
<P>
At Enright's open house Friday, Capizzi's use of deputies was a major topic. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park attorney William A. Dougherty compared it to the old rule in the 
military: "You don't have to do it; it's compulsory." 
</P>
<P>
Enright added that the pressure is not so much on those deputies who 
volunteered, but on those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
"You would never have seen this in a Kenny Williams office," Enright said. 
Williams, who was district attorney before Cecil Hicks, has endorsed Enright's 
candidacy.

Capistrano Unified School District officials expect to forge ahead with 
construction of a parking lot at Capistrano Valley High School after finalizing 
a tentative settlement reached with residents who had obtained an injunction to 
stop work on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Village San Juan housing complex first complained about the 
project after a grove of eucalyptus trees was torn out during grading. 
</P>
<P>
The Village San Juan Homeowners' Assn. then obtained a temporary injunction 
against the school district, claiming it had been improperly notified of the 
lot's construction. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School is on Via Escolar in Mission Viejo but its 
neighbor, the Village San Juan housing complex, is just over the city border in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had placed a notice of the project in a newspaper not 
available in San Juan Capistrano and did not inform the homeowners association 
about the project. However, a sign placed at the project site met notification 
guidelines set by the state, according to school district spokeswoman 
Jacqueline Cerra. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the out-of-court settlement, school district officials have pledged 
to re-landscape the hillside lot and install gates, fencing and speed bumps. 
The injunction will remain in effect until next week, when both sides hope to 
reach a final settlement, Cerra said. Construction will resume after the 
settlement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
Although student parking has never been a problem in Village San Juan, 
residents said, students have parked in neighborhoods in Mission Viejo and 
along Via Escolar when the main school parking lot is filled. CHERYLANNE BEALER

CITY PRESCHOOLERS CAN GET HEAD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preschoolers from low-income families will have the opportunity to get a "head 
start" on kindergarten beginning Monday by participating in a federally funded 
Head Start program offered through the Santa Ana Unified School District for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The highly regarded program is available to families who live on the west side 
of Santa Ana and meet stringent guidelines set by the federal government. The 
program is already offered to students who live in the east side of the city 
through the Council of Affiliated Negro Organizations (CANO). 
</P>
<P>
"What Head Start will do for our youngsters is give them some of the readiness 
skills that they may not have gotten at home,' said Susan Despenas, assistant 
to the district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The district has received two grants totaling $451,000 to start the program, 
which will be offered to 136 youngsters between 3 and 5. The children will 
learn to think, develop language skills and gain confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are able to go into kindergarten with a handle on things," 
Despenas said. "They are able to feel good about themselves and they know how 
to interact with other children." 
</P>
<P>
Head Start was launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. It not only 
aims to prepare children for kindergarten, but also seeks to break the poverty 
cycle by helping children and their parents become contributing members of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Parental involvement is an integral part of the program. Parents are encouraged 
to attend 10 parenting sessions offered by the district's Head Start staff. 
These sessions include topics such as basic nutrition needs, how to discipline 
a child in a positive way and how to help a child's intellectual development, 
Despenas said. 
</P>
<P>
Head Start staff members will spend four days a week in the classroom with the 
children and spend a fifth day visiting the homes of participants to interact 
with their family. 
</P>
<P>
The program also provides participants with meals, health care and

EQUIPMENT FAILURE CAUSES POWER OUTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An underground equipment failure Friday at La Habra Fashion Square caused 1,200 
customers -- including a local hospital -- to lose electrical power for almost 
two hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The blackout at 9:15 a.m. created headaches for residents, banks, stores and 
restaurants in the half-square-mile area bounded by Beach Boulevard on the 
west, Lambert Road on the north, Idaho Street on the east and Imperial Highway 
on the south, according to La Habra police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
At the Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center on Lambert Road, emergency 
generators were automatically activated when the hospital lost power. No 
patients were in danger, and no patient transfers to other hospitals were 
contemplated, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no problems," said Sandy Alderman, assistant director of nursing at 
Friendly Hills Medical Center. "We were able to handle everything." 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital employees, however, reported myriad minor inconveniences brought 
on by the outage. For instance, an automatic glass door to the hospital lobby 
was stuck halfway-closed, making it difficult for people to enter until 
employees cranked the door open. 
</P>
<P>
And hospital administrators posted warnings for people not to use the 
elevators, which were running on emergency power. Electricity was restored to 
the hospital at 9:50 a.m., Alderman said.

5 SINGLE MOTHERS GET COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five single mothers attending Golden West College -- who have been juggling 
nursing internships, college studies and parenting -- have been awarded 
scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 for excellence in nursing. 
</P>
<P>
The Carl W. Bull Award scholarships, named after the late co-founder of 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, are given each year to help Orange County 
students in nursing and other paramedical programs to advance their education. 
</P>
<P>
Jaimie Matlock of Costa Mesa, Lisa Newhart of Westminster and Linda Satler of 
Huntington Beach each earned $2,000 scholarships to help finish their nursing 
studies at Golden West. Laura Carter of Laguna Beach received $1,500, and 
Leslie Bartimore of Huntington Beach was awarded a $1,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The award announcements underscore a trend in the field in which an increasing 
number of single parents are studying nursing to escape low-paying jobs or 
welfare dependency. Many community colleges, such as Golden West, have begun 
tailoring financial aid programs specifically to channel single parents into 
two-year nursing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 35, who must complete three more semesters of studies before she may 
become a registered nurse, said she has been raising her daughter alone for the 
past 11 years. "For most of that time, I've been working as a secretary or a 
cashier or jobs like that," she said. "And things are a little different when 
you have a child. So I want (to become a nurse) for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
Studying, working part time at Hoag Hospital and raising her 14-year-old "is 
not impossible, I've found out, but it is interesting," she said. "It takes a 
lot of time and energy." She said her scholarship money will go toward 
"everyday living expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Matlock and Newhart, who are both raising young children, said their 
scholarship money will be used entirely to help defray day-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
"This scholarship is like a godsend," said Matlock, adding that she hopes to 
become an obstetrics nurse after she graduates next May. And now that she has 
recently reunited with her husband, she said that caring for her 4-year-old son 
and 5-year-old daughter will be less burdensome, as she heads into the most 
demanding year of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Newhart, who works at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and has a 4-year-old 
daughter, said the scholarship money will help her realize a longtime ambition. 
"I've been working in hospitals since I was 16, and I love working with 
people," she said. "And my mother is a nurse, so she's always been my role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
Satler, upon graduating from Golden West, plans to expand upon her nursing 
education before entering a career in either public health or women's health. 
</P>
<P>
Bartimore is working to enter the health profession after spending the past 17 
years as a graphics computer designer for an aerospace firm. JOHN PENNER

40 MEET TO DISCUSS TREE-PLANTING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suggestions bounced back and forth when about 40 people met this week to 
discuss the "greening of Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored by the city's maintenance department and Fullerton 
Beautiful, was part of Fullerton's efforts to hear residents' feedback 
concerning the development of a master plan that will serve as a guide for 
future tree plantings. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Jarvi, president of Fullerton Beautiful, a nonprofit organization that 
focuses on city beautification, said the meeting was a success because it 
produced a lot of positive feedback and suggestions from the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about 60 to 70 suggestions about what should be done to help with this 
master plan," Jarvi said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the city's plans for new tree plantings, Jarvi said the meeting 
also focused on trees that are already planted and how to ensure the health and 
preservation of the city's existing "community forest." 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi said the ideas suggested at the meeting included starting an education 
drive to teach residents the proper way to prune trees and establishing a 
tree-planting program that would involve the city's schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Savage, director of the city's maintenance services, said Fullerton has 
always maintained a high priority for the city's trees and has been named a 
"Tree City USA" for the past 10 years by the National Arbor Day Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify as a Tree City, Savage said, a community must meet four standards: 
It must have a tree board or department, a community tree ordinance, a 
comprehensive community forestry program and an annual Arbor Day observance. 
</P>
<P>
Because Fullerton is one of the county's older cities, Jarvi said, trees are 
plentiful. However, because there are so many, the city needs to adopt a 
program that would maintain existing trees and protect certain species and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't assume that our trees will be getting the proper care," she said. 
"There must be a system that would plant and replace trees that have died or 
have gotten old." 
</P>
<P>
While arbor reverence seemed to dominate the meeting, some trees weren't on 
some of the residents' hit parade. 
</P>
<P>
Ficus and ash trees got mixed reviews, Jarvi said. Bottlebrush trees seemed to 
get an overall thumbs down. ERIK HAMILTON

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE LEAVES STUMP FOR ARMY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TOM UMBERG, ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS' TOP HOPES FOR WINNING A REPUBLICAN 
SEAT, IS ALSO AN ARMY RESERVE MAJOR AND PARATROOPER. HE IS CALLED FOR 2 WEEKS 
OF DUTY. 
</P>

<P>
Assembly candidate Tom Umberg, an Army Reserve officer and one of the 
Democrats' top hopes for winning a Republican seat in November, has been 
dispatched to a military base in the California desert in the Middle East 
crisis mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg, a paratrooper who was an Army captain in Korea and Italy before joining 
the Reserves as a major in 1988, reported Thursday night to Fort Irwin, about 
40 miles northeast of Barstow. He is scheduled to serve there for two weeks 
then return later this month to continue his challenge for the 72nd District 
seat of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after U.S. troops were sent to Saudi Arabia, Umberg told his Army 
Reserve superiors that he is available if needed, campaign manager George Urch 
said. This week he received the notice to report for active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Urch said he is uncertain how the candidate's absence will affect the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign does not intend to make a political issue of Umberg's deployment, 
he said, noting that there was no statement from the candidate or a press 
release announcing the service. 
</P>
<P>
Urch said the campaign could gain some short-term boost from Umberg's 
deployment, especially in such a politically conservative district. But he is 
concerned that the gains could be offset by the candidate's inability to attend 
fund-raisers and speeches and make door-to-door appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, 31, and Umberg, 34, had been scheduled to debate Sunday. Umberg's 
campaign also has at least two fund-raisers scheduled in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to see," Urch said. "Obviously, this is going to have an 
impact on our fund raising and our best precinct walker. But Tom feels strongly 
about helping his country when he's called." 
</P>
<P>
Urch said Umberg could not take press calls or work for the campaign while he 
is on active duty. He also said he is uncertain what Umberg's specific 
assignment is during his deployment and whether he is being prepared for 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
The Pringle-Umberg race is expected to be close, with both receiving 
significant attention from their state party leaders. Democrats have been 
thirsting for the seat because Pringle represents the only Assembly district in 
Orange County in which a majority of voters are registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The district includes Stanton and parts of Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Westminster 
and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he does not believe that Umberg's duty is advantageous to either 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wash," he said. "I don't think either side can or should use it for 
political advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg was an Army paratrooper from 1981 to 1985. He graduated from law school 
at UCLA in 1980 and reported the next year to the Army's 2nd Infantry Division 
in Korea. In 1982 he was trained as a paratrooper and joined NATO troops in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg became a prosecutor in 1987 with the U.S. attorney's office in Santa 
Ana, where he worked until he started his campaign in January. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's wife, Robin, is also a major in the Army Reserve and recently returned 
from San Francisco, where she was temporarily called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Umberg is a nurse and worked in an Army hospital, replacing personnel 
sent to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
She and the candidate met while they were serving in Korea. They have three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Urch said Robin Umberg will make several campaign appearances during her 
husband's absence, including door-to-door walks, speeches and fund raising.

NIXON LIBRARY DIRECTOR IS CHECKING OUT;

RESIGNATION: HUGH HEWITT QUITTING TO RESUME FULL-TIME LAW PRACTICE. FORMER

Hugh Hewitt, executive director of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, 
will step down as head of California's first presidential library to resume 
practicing law full time, a library spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, who oversaw the library's opening ceremonies that drew four Presidents 
and dozens of dignitaries to Yorba Linda on July 19, will be replaced by John 
H. Taylor, Nixon's chief of staff for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who will take over as executive director of the library on Sept. 17, 
"is the natural choice," said library spokesman Kevin Cartwright. "He's worked 
with President Nixon for 10 years, and he knows the President's record. He's 
very anxious to come out here. It's a great opportunity for both John and the 
library." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 35, a graduate of Andover College and UC San Diego, joined Nixon's 
staff in 1980, Cartwright said. He is the author of "Patterns of Abuse: A Novel 
of Politics and Power," published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who Cartwright said is moving to Yorba Linda with his wife, Marsha, and 
two children from New Jersey, where Nixon maintains an office in Saddle River, 
was not available for comment Friday. Nor was Hewitt available. 
</P>
<P>
Although his association with the library was brief, Hewitt stirred national 
controversy when he told The Times a week before the library's opening that 
researchers would be screened and those seen as anti-Nixon would be denied 
access to the former President's papers and records. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt singled out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who won a Pulitzer 
Prize with colleague Carl Bernstein for coverage of the Watergate scandal that 
led to Nixon's resignation in 1974, as one potential researcher who would be 
denied access to the facility. "He's not a responsible journalist," Hewitt said 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The screening policy was rescinded after protests from scholars and journalists 
across the country. Hewitt said he revoked the plan because he had imposed it 
without first consulting Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials on Friday said that Hewitt's resignation as executive 
director was planned several months ago and was not connected to the screening 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"For many, many months he's been concentrating on the successful opening of the 
library," Cartwright said. "He wants to devote his full time to his law 
practice."

JUDGE RELINQUISHES FRAUD CASE 
</P>

<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Harbor Municipal Court judge agreed Friday to transfer control of a case 
involving a man accused of impersonating a lawyer and fleecing unsuspecting 
clients, after learning that she had presided over another matter earlier this 
year in which the defendant was the defense counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Susanne S. Shaw transferred control of the pretrial phase of the case to 
another judge at the conclusion of a hearing punctuated by a shouting match 
between her and the defendant, a man whose identity remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
When Shaw did not agree automatically to transfer control of the case, the 
defendant, who identifies himself as Christopher Kennedy, shouted: 
</P>
<P>
"You're involved in the case. . . . You are the judge who took a plea in a 
particular case that's at issue here." 
</P>
<P>
To which Shaw responded: "Yeah, great. Shut up and sit down. . . . We're going 
to send you back downstairs (to jail), get out of here."

2 JUDGES MAKE OPPOSITE RULINGS ON PROP. 115; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THEY DISAGREE OVER THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A PROVISION PERMITTING POLICE 
HEARSAY TESTIMONY AT PRELIMINARY HEARINGS.

<P>
Two Orange County judges on Friday made exactly opposite rulings on a provision 
in the newly passed California court reform initiative that permits police 
officers to testify for victims and other witnesses at preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Leonard H. McBride declared unconstitutional the provision 
of Proposition 115 that permits such hearsay or indirect testimony. He 
dismissed charges against a defendant accused of joy riding and another accused 
of burglary because a police officer had been permitted by Municipal Court 
judges in their cases to provide all the key evidence at their preliminary 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
But just half an hour later, Superior Court Judge William W. Bedsworth, 
listening to the same arguments from the same lawyers who had appeared before 
McBride, upheld the constitutionality of the provision. He refused to dismiss, 
on those grounds, auto theft and burglary charges against a separate set of 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's going to have to be the state Supreme Court that resolves this 
issue," said James Barnett, the defense lawyer who appeared before both judges. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we get a definitive answer, we'll have to decide on a case-by-case basis 
whether to seek the use of hearsay testimony," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of a preliminary hearing in California is for a magistrate to 
determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold a defendant to answer for 
charges against him or her at a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over police hearsay testimony at such hearings was one of the more 
volatile issues argued before Proposition 115 was passed by the voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents claim that it denies a defendant the chance to have any meaningful 
cross-examination of witnesses, which often provides a judge the information 
needed to decide whether a defendant should be bound over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors and other supporters of the provision claim it's a way to cut 
down on needless hours of court time at preliminary hearings. Also, it spares 
victims and other witnesses an extra court appearance, since they already have 
to testify at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But McBride said he does not believe that sparing the victims and witnesses a 
trip to court should be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
A defendant should have the right to confront witnesses against him or her, 
"the sooner the better," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added: "We're presuming guilt (under Proposition 115) without any 
real judicial process. If we didn't have judicial process, we wouldn't have 
much left in this country." 
</P>
<P>
But Bedsworth did not have the same problem with the law. He told defense 
lawyers that he disagrees that the hearsay provision of Proposition 115 "guts" 
the defendant's guarantee of a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people of this state want to have a preliminary hearing of this type, 
they are allowed to do so," Bedsworth ruled. "They couldn't do it under the 
California Constitution, so they amended it. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I can't find it written in stone that progress means an expansion of 
someone's rights." 
</P>
<P>
Bedsworth is a former prosecutor who was a strong opponent of former Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. McBride is considered by most prosecutors to be 
one of the most liberal judges on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
In the two cases before McBride, prosecutors must now either re-file the 
charges and hope the cases are sent to a different judge or appeal McBride's 
decision to the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, Judge McBride's decision is not binding on other judges," said 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi.

Four years ago, Marv Marinovich was working at his Anaheim athletic training 
facility when a gangly 12-year-old girl wandered through the door with her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"She was kind of awkward and untrained, more so than the boys," Marinovich 
remembered. "I don't like to run down athletes, but she had a bad knee and a 
sore ankle. Her back was sore, too. Her workload was too much for her." 
</P>
<P>
Tara Kroesch's knee and ankle had taken a beating after only two seasons in 
youth volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Leroy, brought her to his longtime friend, Marinovich, for help. He 
had heard of Marinovich's training program, which was made famous by 
Marinovich's son, Todd, the starting quarterback at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 5-feet-9 in the seventh grade," Leroy Kroesch said. "She grew so fast 
that she started having knee problems after the first year she played." 
</P>
<P>
In the next few months, Kroesch strengthened her knees while working out with 
Marinovich. The pain, which she said felt -- and sounded -- like "two pieces of 
sandpaper rubbing together" disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pain was gone, Kroesch continued with the weight training. She 
kept getting stronger and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed for the 12-year-old girl with a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
Kroesch, a 5-11 junior, is entering her third year as a starter on the Newport 
Harbor High School volleyball team, ranked 12th in Volleyball Monthly's 
national preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Kroesch and Maureen McLaren, a 6-0 junior and also a two-year starter, are 
considered two of the top outside hitters in the county. They're among five 
starters returning from last year's 14-5 team that reached the first round of 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Kroesch, 16, already has received recruiting letters from the University of the 
Pacific, Iowa, Oklahoma and Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Kroesch attributes much of her success to her work with Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a major part of my improvement," she said. "I started out just 
lifting, then I got into the running. It got to be a lot of fun this summer." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Brande, who has coached Kroesch on an Orange County club team the past 
few years, said the training has made her a better player. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a coach's dream," Brande said. "She's one of the hardest workers I've 
ever seen. She's always doing extra work." 
</P>
<P>
So if Todd Marinovich was tabbed "Robo QB" for his training, does that make 
Kroesch the "Robo-spiker"? 
</P>
<P>
After all, she eats, drinks, lifts and runs -- all in the name of volleyball. 
Ask her what her interests outside volleyball are and she'll tell you, "going 
to the beach and working out with Marv." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich said Kroesch had no problems learning his program, which combines 
diet and mental approach with state-of-the-art physical training. 
</P>
<P>
"The program here encompasses all aspects of training," Marinovich said. "Tara 
is very, very focused. She has been from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said he hopes she isn't too focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I always try to stay out of that," Glenn said. "Sometimes it's too much. We 
have to remember she's only 16 years old." 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Kroesch trains three or four days a week with 
Marinovich. She trains one or two days a week in Anaheim after the club 
volleyball season starts in January. 
</P>
<P>
Her father said it's important that she keep her priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletics are so time consuming," Leroy Kroesch said. "She studies three hours 
a day, works out three hours a day and plays volleyball. But her schedule 
doesn't seem to bother her. She's very well organized. She knows that academics 
come first." 
</P>
<P>
Tara is the youngest of Leroy and Kathy Kroesch's seven children. Her brother, 
Ken, played football at Estancia, but Tara "has the most discipline of any of 
us, by far," Leroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich knows all too well. 
</P>
<P>
"She's now on the top level and she could actually teach at the facility," 
Marinovich said. "There are only about 10 or 12 athletes who are on her level 
right now (out of about 60 in the program)." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the athletes in the program are football and basketball players. 
Kroesch is training, and keeping up with Todd Marinovich; Ron Byers, a former 
Mater Dei standout now playing offensive line at Cal State Long Beach, and 
basketball star Ed O'Bannon, a freshman at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"She's on par with all the top athletes I have here," Marinovich said. "In our 
system, it's not age or sport, but how much training you have. It's more like a 
school and we don't slow anyone down. She grasps all the concepts." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich said Kroesch has set an example for other athletes. She's one of 
only a half dozen women in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"When I have a young male athlete who has some ability, a real hotshot, I 
always bring Tara over and have her teach the guy the technique," Marinovich 
said. "It humbles them. She's so well versed in everything." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich put Kroesch in his running program this summer with his football 
players. The program combines aerobic and anaerobic workouts, with participants 
running six 150-yard sprints while monitoring heartbeat during rest periods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very competitive," Marinovich said. "The guys don't want to let anyone 
ahead of them, especially a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Kroesch said he never realized his daughter was so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's really fast," he said. "She could go run track if she wants to." 
</P>
<P>
Tara Kroesch said she's considering playing basketball and possibly running 
track. But volleyball's the main thing on her mind right now -- beating Corona 
del Mar and winning the Sea View League in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to win the league and see how far we can get in the 
playoffs," she said. "Coach Glenn wants the best out of us and pushes us. He 
knows we can do well." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to list the top girls' volleyball players in Orange County, Foothill 
Coach Travis Turner didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Corona del Mar's starting six," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Turner may not be far off the mark. Volleyball Monthly magazine ranked Corona 
del Mar second in its preseason national poll. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sea Kings lost Danielle Everett, the Times' Orange County player 
of the year, and Krista Hartling, an all-county first team player, to 
graduation, they still have everal experienced players. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the list is senior Lara Carlsen, an all-Southern Section selection last 
season. Also returning are Prentice Perkins and Tracy Schriber, both seniors 
who were all-Sea View League selections last year, and Stacy Petersen, a team 
co-captain and senior outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
A new addition to the lineup will be Tahlia Wagner, a transfer from Rim of the 
World, where she earned all-Southern Section honors last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner is not the only new face at practice. Dale Flickinger of Redondo Beach 
has taken over as the Sea King coach, replacing Charlie Brande, who was 
relieved of his duties in the wake of an investigation by the Southern Section 
concerning his coaching of club teams. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra, ranked 11th in Volleyball Monthly's national poll, finished with a 
7-0 record on a tour of Australia this summer. The Highlanders also finished 
second to Thousand Oaks at a national high school tournament. They return seven 
players from last year's 21-1 team that won the Southern Section 3-A 
championship and the Division II state title. Their top player is Missy 
Clements, one of the best in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rich Polk is Woodbridge's new coach, replacing Steve Stratos, who has left to 
become the women's volleyball coach at Loyola Marymount. . . . Gregg Swenson 
has returned from a one-year leave of absence to coach at Mission Viejo. . . . 
Lisa Mariotti, who coached the Laguna Beach girls two years ago, is the new 
coach at University. . . . Troy Abbey is a first-year coach at Mater Dei.

TITANS TAKE REALISTIC ATTITUDE, SENSE OF HUMOR INTO AUBURN; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: FULLERTON, WHICH WILL BRING HOME $250,000 FROM TODAY'S GAME, DOESN'T 
EXPECT A MIRACLE AGAINST THE TIGERS.

AUBURN, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Allen tried to motivate Cal State Long Beach for last week's game 
against Clemson by bringing in his former chaplain with the Washington Redskins 
for a pregame pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the success of that gimmick -- Long Beach lost, 59-0 -- Cal State 
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy figures drastic ecclesiastic measures are in order 
for the Titans' game at third-ranked Auburn today. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I can bring in the Pope to read me my last rites," Murphy joked. 
</P>
<P>
At least Murphy hasn't lost his sense of humor about a game he describes as "a 
necessary evil" -- necessary because Fullerton will come home with a $250,000 
guarantee check that will help sustain the football program, and evil because 
the Tigers figure to do nasty things to the Titans in Jordan-Hare Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn has 14 starters, eight on defense and six on offense, from a team that 
went 10-2 last season, shared the Southeastern Conference championship and beat 
Ohio State in the Hall of Fame Bowl, 31-14. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Auburn players have been selected to the preseason All-SEC team. Five 
Tigers, including top-rated offensive guard Ed King, have been ranked among the 
top six players in the nation at their positions by The Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
And two of those touted by The Sporting News, nose guard Walter Tate (rated 
third) and defensive tackle Fernando Horn (rated sixth), won't even start for 
Auburn today. They lost their jobs to Richard Shea and Jon Wilson in the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who allowed only three touchdown passes in 1989, will be bigger, 
faster and stronger than the Titans at virtually every position. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to King, who is 6 feet 4 and 284 pounds, the Tigers have such 
standouts as James Joseph, a 6-2, 225-pound fullback, and David Rocker, a 6-4, 
264-pound defensive tackle and younger brother of the Redskins' Tracy Rocker, 
who won the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy as an Auburn defensive 
lineman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
About the only area Fullerton stacks up well against Auburn is the kicking 
game, where the Titans have a proven player in Phil Nevin and the Tigers have 
first-year kicker Jim Von Wyl. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect the game to come down to the kickers. Most would be surprised 
if Fullerton scores as many points as Auburn scores extra points. 
</P>
<P>
And don't expect Auburn to approach triple figures on the scoreboard, even 
though they possibly could if they kept their starters in the entire game. 
Coach Pat Dye isn't that type. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in it to see how many points we can score," Dye said of the game, 
Auburn's season opener. "We just want to play the game. Our plans are to play a 
lot of people, because we have a lot of young guys who need experience." 
</P>
<P>
That has to be somewhat comforting for Murphy and the Titans, who last week 
struggled to defeat Division II Sonoma State, 38-24. 
</P>
<P>
This is a rebuilding year for Fullerton, but games against Auburn and 
Mississippi State next week could stunt the Titans' growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want us to get better as a team and be as competitive as we possibly 
can," Murphy said. "We'll have some fun with it. That's not to say all 60 
minutes will be fun, but some good things will happen." 
</P>
<P>
One good thing is the Titans will get a first-hand look at big-time college 
football. A crowd of at least 77,000 is expected in Jordan-Hare Stadium, which 
has a capacity of 85,214. 
</P>
<P>
When filled, Auburn's stadium would be the fifth most populous city in Alabama 
behind Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery and Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Auburn has a population of just 30,000. But for the second 
consecutive season, Auburn has sold 75,000 season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is a religion there," Murphy said. "They start coming into town for 
games on Thursday morning. Their intra-squad game last spring drew about 
35,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be an experience for all of us -- coaches, players and administrators. 
I'm sure we'll all have a tinge of jealousy when we get there." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton offensive guard Shannon Illingworth, who suffered a hyper-extended 
elbow in last week's game, suffered a partial tear of the medial collateral 
ligament in his knee during Tuesday's practice and will be out for three or 
four weeks. . . . Wide receiver Kerry Reed suffered a similar injury in the 
Sonoma State game and also will miss three or four games. . . . Reserve 
defensive back Michael Jones, who earned special teams player of the week 
honors for his performance against Sonoma State, broke a finger in the game and 
will miss two or three games. . . . Deon Thomas, the starting running back who 
suffered a season-ending knee injury last week, will undergo reconstructive 
surgery in about two weeks. . . . Auburn will be trying to win its fourth 
consecutive SEC title, a feat accomplished only once in the 57-year history of 
the SEC. Alabama, under Paul (Bear) Bryant, won titles from 1971-74. . . . 
Auburn has the third-best winning percentage in the nation over the past seven 
years with a 67-16-2 (.800) record, behind Miami (.870) and Nebraska (.837).

SHOWTIME COMES TO IRVINE IN SCOTT'S CHARITY GAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LAKER GUARD'S SQUAD OF TEAMMATES AND EX-TEAMMATES FALLS TO MARK 
EATON'S NBA STARS, 146-143, IN BREN CENTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Showtime? In Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
Off the opening tip, to Byron Scott . . . three! From the left wing, Scott for 
two. With the first dunk of the evening, A.C. Green for two. Swooping under the 
net for a reverse layup, Kurt Rambis for two. 
</P>
<P>
And who says there's no defense in the pros? 
</P>
<P>
On the other end . . . with the monster block . . . Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
It's 9-2 Lakers, and it's Showtime! Or is it? There's no mousse in that coach's 
hair. There's an Anteater on the court . . . and the Lakers lost. The ersatz 
Lakers, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A team of NBA stars captained by Utah's Mark Eaton rallied to defeat Scott's 
Lakers and Co. squad, 146-143, in Scott's fourth "Challenge for Children" 
charity basketball game at the Bren Center Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime? Scott considered it a reasonable facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like the Lakers out there," Scott said. "It was almost a family 
reunion." Almost. But Rambis plays for Phoenix. Orlando Woolridge, another 
former Laker, plays for Denver. Michael Cooper plays in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Scott missed Cooper in particular Friday, and not only as a backcourt buddy. 
For the first time, Cooper wasn't around to help Scott stage his benefit game. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real weird," Scott said. "He's been such a big part of this since the 
beginning. In your professional career, you're going to see some changes. But 
it's very tough to lose people you care about." 
</P>
<P>
But the festivities went on without Cooper, and the Lakers have gone on without 
Rambis. The Lakers will go on without Woolridge and without Cooper, and no one 
knows that better than Rambis, torchbearer for the Laker alumni Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time," Rambis said, "but it wasn't that strange. It's the 
reality of the game. I wasn't crying when I left the Lakers. It was a good 
opportunity for me to move on, and that's the way the team has to go about it. 
They want to win." 
</P>
<P>
So does Rambis, but he asks that you hold off on the NBA season for a while 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he said with hands on hips after the game, "shows me just how far out 
of shape I am." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Leckner, the seven-footer from the Sacramento Kings, drives the lane, 
passes off, and sets a screen for Chachi. You remember Chachi, from the TV 
series "Happy Days." He's Scott Baio, one of the celebrities chosen to play 
with the NBA stars Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So there was Baio, with the ball and the screen from Leckner. He made an 
eight-foot jumper and the crowd went wild. Next time down, Baio got the ball at 
halfcourt, dribbled a couple times and attempted an outrageous three-pointer, 
hitting nothing but air. This time, the crowd booed.

NUTS AND BOLTS / PATRICK MOTT: FLAMINGOS BRING OUT A FRIEND'S TRUE COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I lived in San Francisco a few years ago, I had a neighbor who kept a pair 
of plastic pink lawn flamingos in a large indoor planter box. They weren't just 
pink, but an audible, jangling, sizzling, screaming sort of ferocious nuclear 
meltdown pink that radiated around the room like a carbon arc beam, and my 
neighbor loved them with a deep, abiding love. 
</P>
<P>
They invariably inspired comment. Guests would arrive and immediately reel back 
out into the hallway, not quite ready to believe what they were seeing. The 
things might as well have been pink elephants. The last time any of them had 
seen plastic lawn flamingos (never mind ones that shot shattering bolts of pink 
throughout the room) they had tripped over them in the neighbors' yard on their 
way to watch Howdy Doody. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there was something about them, a certain goofy genuineness, a 
blaring presence that announced that you were in the home of someone who would 
rather be buried neck deep in an anthill than, say, own a car phone. 
</P>
<P>
They were infectious. Guests who had not been to my neighbor's house before 
would invariably end up standing on one leg and doing flamingo imitations 
before the evening was through. And, just as invariably, they would want to 
know where they, too, could buy a pair. Four hours before, the idea of owning a 
pair of plastic pink lawn flamingos had about as good a chance of materializing 
in their minds as the thought of Dan Quayle in a bunny suit. But once the 
visitors saw them, and lived with them for a bit, they would embark on a holy 
quest for the things that made the Crusades look like a trip to the 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
So, right away, let me save you a bit of time and anguish. Perhaps the easiest 
way to acquire a pair of plastic pink lawn flamingos is to order them from a 
truly inspired outfit in Seattle called Archie McPhee and Co. It is a 
mail-order house and it sells, among other bits of esoterica, Groucho glasses, 
rubber chickens, plastic tiki lamps, Batman drinking mugs and Be-A-Spy kits. 
They also sell plastic pink lawn flamingos, each about 3 feet tall, for $9.50 a 
pair, plus $3 shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Archie McPhee is at P.O. Box 30852, Seattle, Wash., 98103-0852. Or you can 
place an order by calling (206) 547-2467. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had their ups and downs over the years, but for the most part they've 
been a real steady item," said Brian Eklund, the office manager of McPhee's 
wholesale division. "The main call for them is for housewarming presents. And a 
lot of people buy them around Christmastime. They'll exchange them at office 
Christmas parties. They're a real classic kind of tacky joke item." 
</P>
<P>
A joke to Eklund, perhaps, but they've been paying Don Featherstone's freight 
since he designed the classic 3-D flamingo back in the '50s. Featherstone is 
the vice president of Union Products of Leominster, Mass., the manufacturer 
that introduced the lawn flamingo to the world in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
That first flamingo model, said Featherstone, was plastic and flat and somewhat 
aesthetically unappealing when contrasted with the present incarnation. The 
second model was three-dimensional "but it was made of construction foam and 
fell apart rather quickly," said Featherstone. "Dogs loved to chew it up." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1957, Featherstone hit the mother lode. He sculpted a 
three-dimensional pink plastic flamingo that was artistic, durable and, for the 
most part, dog-proof. It is the model that Union Products continues to sell 
today, complete with Featherstone's molded signature on the underside of each 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designer poor taste," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although easily the most recognized of Union's products -- it specializes in 
plastic "lawn art" -- the flamingo is not the company's biggest seller, said 
Featherstone. Union's original item, a plastic lawn duck, is still No. 1, 
followed by the plastic hen-and-chicks combo. The flamingo is third. The 
company sells about 250,000 pairs of them each year, said Featherstone. 
</P>
<P>
Union also makes plastic squirrels, rabbits, cows -- a total of 50 different 
plastic animals to strew around the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Featherstone, the flamingo has a devoted cult following. There are 
several clubs and organizations around the country, he said, that "don't really 
worship the flamingos, but they get together and have parties. In Virginia, 
there's a group that has a parade and everybody dresses in pink. They've been 
doing it for 12 or 13 years." 
</P>
<P>
And in Connecticut, he said, there's a group called the Society for the 
Preservation of the Pink Plastic Lawn Flamingo. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, this sort of thing is not for everybody. People who own designer 
pets, for example, or those who only allow their kids to watch PBS, probably 
won't appreciate the guaranteed double takes that will occur when passers-by

If, however, you long to own a couple of non-biodegradable pieces of true 
Americana, for cheap, signed by the designer himself and guaranteed to jazz up 
your landscape like a zoot suit jazzes up an inaugural ball, then part with a 
sawbuck or so and get the birds.

Thanks to paradise-perfect days, Californians just can't get enough of a view. 
For some, the ideal home is a cantilevered A-frame with a view of the Pacific. 
For others, it's a sprawling ranch model, where walls of glass look out on 
sun-dappled patios surrounded by flower-filled gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Whether your dream home is a chateau or a condo, chances are it features 
fascinating windows. But the trend is more mellow than modern, as Californians 
rediscover the charm of the old-fashioned bay window. 
</P>
<P>
"A window is just a window," says psychotherapist Rhea Vogt. "Even a whole bank 
of windows or sliding glass doors -- which give us the feeling of free-flowing 
space -- are still only two-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
"What's so special about bay windows is their three-dimensionality, which 
creates the illusion of the indoors and outdoors coming together. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime virtue of a bay window is that it's like a little extra room, a room 
that's all yours. We're such a frenzied, harassed society. We have less and 
less personal space because of overcrowding. Bay windows are intimate, special 
places where people feel secure. It's your little space -- that's something 
that you can't get from a two-dimensional sliding glass door, which gives us a 
view, but not the intimacy and warmth we crave." 
</P>
<P>
Besides their emotional appeal, bay windows are practical -- and aesthetically 
captivating. From the outside, bay windows add dimension and architectural 
interest to a home. On the inside, bays act to extend the living area outward, 
increasing the spatial dimensions of the interior and broadening the view. 
</P>
<P>
Bay windows come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. The largest -- and 
perhaps the most elegant -- is the walk-in bay, with inviting floor-to-ceiling 
open space contained between the angles of the windows. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of oversized, walk-in bays crowned with a circle-head window enhance one 
of the turrets in a large custom home in Fullerton. On the other side of the 
Tudor-style house is another turret, inset with a bay window at ground level 
and a balcony above. 
</P>
<P>
The bay window in the living room embraces a space large enough for a pair of 
wing-backed chairs with a reading table and lamp placed between them. The other 
downstairs bay holds an efficient and attractive bar in the family room. The 
upstairs bay, which contains a writing area, frames a treetop view of the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Because the homeowners wanted to preserve lovely garden views, designer Lisa 
Weber kept draperies to a minimum: soft swags of fabric and cloud valances add 
a touch of color and tie the area in with each room's decor. 
</P>
<P>
For many homeowners, one of the most appealing features of a bay window is the 
many ways the space between the windows can be utilized. Traditionally, bay 
windows are associated with cozy, built-in seating areas where you can enjoy 
the wonders of nature while surrounded by the comfort of your home. Many bays 
are still used that way, with downy cushions covering window seats that conceal 
a handy, hidden area for storage. 
</P>
<P>
When space is at a premium, bay windows are the perfect spots for built-in 
bookcases, cabinets, desks and countertops. One of Lisa Weber's clients, who 
enjoys seasonal decorating, had a countertop built into a bay window that faced 
the sidewalk in front of her home. "Her gift to the neighborhood is the 
charming holiday displays she sets up for passers-by," Weber says. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, it's not exactly the view but the illusion of a view that makes 
a bay window intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most ingenious ways to use a bay window is to put it 
"inside" the home. When an architect placed a bay window -- instead of a wall 
-- at one end of a long narrow kitchen, a family gained a charming breakfast 
nook with a pretty view of the entry beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Linda Barth designed a booth, made up of a table and a curving 
built-in window seat, to fit snugly inside the bay and custom-designed leaded 
glass panes that repeat patterns used in adjoining areas of the home. "There's 
so many things you can do with bay windows," says Barth, "the possibilities 
seem endless." 
</P>
<P>
Because they are so adaptable, every room of the house is a candidate for a bay 
window. When used in a small bedroom, they "open up" the area because of the 
additional space and light they bring to the room. And, unless plumbing 
interferes, kitchens and bathrooms can be updated dramatically by adding bay 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Naomi Mason used a bay window to surround a spa tub. To ensure 
privacy, Mason covered the window with a balloon shade, a luxurious window 
treatment that adds to the ambience of the setting. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something appealing about bay windows," Mason says, "they're cozy and 
romantic." To create an aura of romance in a master bedroom, Mason suggests 
embellishing the window with lace curtains and placing a sofa or a chaise 
within the curve of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
By incorporating the latest types of energy-saving features into the windows 
themselves, problems such as heat loss and fading can be overcome. Specially 
treated glass is available, as well as double-paned windows, which contain air 
space that conserves heat and muffles sound.

WINDOWS CAN GIVE NEW LOOK 
</P>

<P>
Although Southern California has a reputation as a transient society, many of 
us like where we live. When real estate developers blanketed Orange County with 
tract homes, many of us headed south, opened escrow and planted trees. While 
our landscaping took root, so did we. 
</P>
<P>
Although our children are grown and gone, good neighbors and favorite stores 
are still nearby. Besides, with today's housing prices, many can't consider 
moving. Yet, the real estate ads seem tempting, and model homes make us drool. 
</P>
<P>
For many, remodeling is a practical solution. Adding new windows and doors is 
one of the easiest ways to update a house that now seems small -- and dare I 
say it -- boring. 
</P>
<P>
If the windows are bays, the increase in space is an attractive bonus. 
Standard-sized, ready-made bay windows that "pop in" to the opening created 
when conventional windows are removed are the most economical, but 
custom-designed bay windows are becoming increasingly popular as homeowners 
seek new ways to make their homes distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
Although a simple "change out" can be done in a matter of hours, if the opening 
needs to be enlarged, walls need to be moved, or a roof line needs to be 
adjusted, the structural changes will involve additional time and expense. 
</P>
<P>
"For a properly sealed, dual-paned, wood-framed window with both seat and 
soffit (with the 'ceiling' or overhead portion) measuring 8 feet wide by 4 feet 
high, costs range from $1,200 to $1,500, depending on options such as special 
glazing, tinting and exterior cladding (specially treated aluminum over the 
exterior wood). The standard installation fee is an additional $300 to $500," 
says Stevan Smith, salesman for Pella Windows in Corona. A less expensive 
product would run about 50% less, and a highly customized window could cost 
about 30% more. 
</P>
<P>
Some things to consider are whether surrounding paint, stucco and veneers of 
stone or brick can be matched after the window is set in place. When window 
replacements are part of larger remodeling projects, each phase needs to be 
coordinated to minimize costs as well as inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, however, well-executed architectural changes enhance a home's 
livability and tend to raise the value of a house. BETH COBB

BONSAI, THE ART OF CUTTING, WIRING AND TRIMMING PLANTS TO STUNT THEIR GROWTH, 
IS AN ARTISTIC CHALLENGE IN ITSELF.

A warm summer breeze gently rustles the branches of a cluster of liquidambars. 
Nearby, the leaves of a lonely maple are beginning to change to fall colors. 
Pine, junipers and elms are nestled close by. A beautiful forest, right? Yes, 
but with a difference. This "forest" is planted in pots not much deeper than a 
few inches. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is because yard space is at a premium or because there is a sense of 
artistry to this craft, more Southern Californians are turning to the ancient 
art of bonsai. 
</P>
<P>
This living art, a tree planted in a dish, is relatively new in the United 
States but carries with it a long history. In China, bonsai has existed for 
more than 1,500 years. In Japan, the first mention of bonsai appears in the 
Kamakura Period (1192-1333). 
</P>
<P>
"We've noticed an increased interest in bonsai over the past few years," said 
Jim Murata, owner of Murata Bonsai Garden in Westminster. The nursery, which 
deals exclusively with bonsai trees and plants, showcases about 1,000 miniature 
trees in different varieties. These trees share shelf space with rosebushes the 
size of teacups, and tiny, delicate ferns. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonsai is a way of combining art and nature," Murata explained. "By trimming 
and wiring, you can bend branches and trees in unusual shapes -- but you have 
to know how much the tree can take. If you push too hard, it breaks. The key is 
to work with the tree, not against it." 
</P>
<P>
When Murata first opened his nursery 15 years ago, he wasn't sure if Southern 
Californians would be interested in the tiny trees and plants. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, where I grew up, space is confined so bonsai is very popular," he 
explained. "My family was always interested in bonsai. When I came here, I 
thought it would be wonderful if I could make a living introducing bonsai to 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are thousands of different types of bonsai trees, in Southern 
California, the traditional junipers are the biggest sellers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the first image that comes to mind when people think of bonsai," 
Murata said. "They also do pretty well in this climate. Since they're 
evergreens, they look good all year long." 
</P>
<P>
Trees such as maples, oaks, liquidambars and Chinese elms experience the 
seasonal changes just like their larger counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sell as many of those in the winter because they lose their leaves," 
Murata said, laughing. "People think the trees are dead, when, in fact, they're 
simply doing what's normal. In the spring, when they're starting to blossom 
again, they're very popular." 
</P>
<P>
The average height of a bonsai tree is about 20 to 25 inches, compared to the 
25 to 30 feet they would grow naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very attracted to their small size," Murata admitted, while 
fingering the leaves of a small maple. "To see something so big changed into 
something so small seems almost magical." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's nothing magical about creating a bonsai tree. It takes skill to 
develop, but after that, Murata claims, their care is relatively easy. The key 
to success is water and an occasional trim. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, the trees are in very shallow pots so they tend to dry out quickly," 
Murata explained. "For this reason, it's important to water them frequently -- 
about once a day. As for trimming, care for them is about the same as for other 
plants. Remove dead leaves and branches, and trim two or three times a year." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are those who prefer to start their trees "from scratch." For these 
do-it-yourselfers, Murata stocks about 50 varieties of seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans enjoy doing things by themselves," he said. "Even though it's a bit 
more difficult, they're at least willing to give it a try." 
</P>
<P>
If successful, bonsai gardeners can look forward to many years of life from 
their trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This California juniper is estimated to be about 400 years old," Murata said, 
showing off the tree with pride. "What's unusual about this tree, besides its 
advanced age, is that it was almost dead. One branch was still living so I 
grafted a Shimpatu juniper to it. Now the gnarled trunk of the tree supports 
new life at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge to work with these trees," Murata said. "Since they are so 
small, the focus is on detail and beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Working on bonsai trees primarily consists of cutting, wiring and trimming to 
get the desired effect. Depending on the kind of tree, those interested in 
learning bonsai techniques frequently start with the heartier junipers. Once 
these have been mastered, bonsai enthusiasts can move on to the more difficult 
plum trees, fog needle pines and Duzuki azaleas. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for bonsai trees range from $15 to $700, depending on the tree and 
arrangement selected. According to Murata, one of the most expensive bonsai 
trees in California recently sold for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with bonsai trees is an art," Murata said. "You can see the creativity 
of the artist in many of the arrangements, the way trees are grouped, styled, 
what combinations of plants are used. What's encouraging to me is that more 
people are beginning to appreciate bonsai." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are interested in learning more about bonsai, there are several 
different organizations and classes in Orange County that can help the beginner 
or advanced student.

MAGISTRATE PRODS CITY TO SETTLE REMAP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effort to resolve a Latino voting rights lawsuit without a long and costly 
trial took a new turn Friday when seven City Council members met privately with 
a U.S. magistrate, who urged them to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
But the approximately half-hour session -- at which the council members were 
ordered to appear -- did little to heal the divisions between two bitterly 
opposed factions: the City Council and the Chicano Federation of San Diego 
County, which filed the class-action lawsuit against the council in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue met with lawyers for the 
council and the federation in hopes of reaching a settlement, which, at 
midweek, had appeared imminent. On Thursday afternoon, when a compromise 
agreement essentially collapsed, he ordered the council to Friday morning's 
session, but told those involved to keep it secret. 
</P>
<P>
McCue told the seven members who attended -- Mayor Maureen O'Connor and 
Councilwoman Judy McCarty were out of town -- that it would be in everyone's 
best interest to settle the case and urged them to approve the proposed 
settlement that had fallen through the day before, according to some of the 
lawyers and council members present. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with all seven council members, McCue met with them individually 
and in small groups. Councilman Bob Filner, who represents the key Latino 8th 
District, his lawyer and others presented McCue with a counterproposal, a map 
with yet another configuration of the district. 
</P>
<P>
McCue called Michael Aguirre, the lawyer for the Chicano Federation, and asked 
him to study the new proposal. But Aguirre, after analyzing the plan most of 
the day, rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
With the rejection came a return to the bellicose rhetoric that had previously 
marked negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a litigation mode now," Aguirre said at a late-afternoon press 
conference. He said five members of the council who voted for a disputed 
redistricting map last month and reaffirmed that decision last week have been 
served subpoenas. In all, he said, about 40 subpoenas will be issued, and the 
first depositions will begin Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The process of sworn interrogations will last about six weeks, Aguirre said. A 
trial will probably begin in November on the federation's contention that the 
council majority conspired to circumvent a previous settlement agreement and, 
in doing so, violated the federal Voting Rights Act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he sees little likelihood of a settlement now "unless the five 
(members of the majority bloc) back away from group think . . . because Filner 
will never agree to a district where a Latino has a reasonable chance of 
winning. . . . His incumbency is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said Filner "has proposed a very clever proposal that has the 
appearance of a Latino district but not the reality of it." 
</P>
<P>
Filner was not available for comment after the press conference, but earlier in 
the day he said, "Aguirre is full of (expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
"We made what we thought was a counteroffer" that boosted the percentage of the 
Latino population in the district close to what Aguirre had proposed, Filner 
said, adding that he expects both proposals to be presented to the City Council 
in closed session Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and colleagues Linda Bernhardt and John Hartley had rejected Aguirre's 
plan because it would have taken the community of Nestor, which has a white 
majority, out of the South Bay and the largely Latino 8th District, and put it 
in District 2 by way of a line drawn through San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
They said that, not only is Nestor geographically and politically separate from 
District 2, which mainly represents residents in Point Loma and Mission Hills, 
but that such a division could potentially lead to racial strife in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre and the federation called the contention preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
The counterproposal unveiled Friday by Filner and his attorney, David Lundin, 
would keep Nestor in District 8. It would increase the Latino population in the 
district largely by shifting a portion of downtown -- situated immediately 
southwest of Balboa Park and containing about 8,000 people, most of them white 
-- into District 3; moving another neighborhood, mainly black, into District 4, 
and putting the Harbor View-Little Italy neighborhood near the bay into 
District 8. 
</P>
<P>
According to Filner, the counteroffer places the percentage of Latinos in the 
8th District at 53.5%, higher than the 51.9% on the map approved by the 
five-member majority. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, working with Leo Estrada, an associate professor of urban planning at 
UCLA and a recognized expert on census data and demographics, said the 
federation's proposal -- the one that splits away Nestor -- puts the Latino 
population at about 54.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, Estrada and the federation were asked why a compromise cannot be 
reached and why a lengthy trial that could cost at least $2 million cannot be 
avoided if what separates the two sides is a figure of less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that, although the two proposals are close numerically, the 
differences in the configuration of the districts -- what's out and what's in 
-- are significant. 
</P>
<P>
"We achieved the same results in two different ways," said Estrada, who, 
working for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the 
American Civil Liberties Union, drafted a redistricting map for supervisorial 
districts in Los Angeles County. That map was accepted by a federal court there 
as part of a similar Latino voting rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the federation's rejection of Filner's counterproposal may seem 
arcane for most laymen, but Aguirre and Estrada said the differences are real 
and seriously affect the probability of a Latino being elected to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said it is in the federation's best interest to keep the 8,000 people 
next to Balboa Park in the 8th District. Even though most of them are white, 
Latinos constitute a significant minority and are a "stable" population, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Estrada said, the Harbor View-Little Italy area, also composed of 
several thousand residents -- most of them white but again with a large Latino 
minority -- is in transition, and demographic projections show it will become 
more white and thus dilute Latino strength in the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Estrada said the counteroffer's plan to move a census tract into 
the 7th District is a detriment because analysis shows Latino growth is moving 
east toward Lemon Grove and that the 8th District outlined in the new proposal 
would not take advantage of that. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Estrada said that taking Nestor out of the South Bay is not without 
precedent. He said the state 79th Assembly District does just that, taking it 
out of San Ysidro and placing it with Coronado and Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Filner said his offer was part of an effort to avoid a 
trial. He said that, in the interest of compromise, he gave up the southwest 
Balboa Park neighborhood even though "I didn't want to give downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day Friday, attorney Lundin -- who represents Filner, Hartley and 
Bernhardt -- sent Aguirre a letter in which he appealed to him to discuss "the 
merits of this case quietly and responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients have proposed a map which comes so close to yours that the 
differences are no longer statistically significant," Lundin said in the 
letter, shown to Aguirre during his press conference. " . . . The map as put 
forward contains a number of compromises and sacrifices on the part of our 
clients and was done in the hope that you would be willing to make at least a 
change in your otherwise hard and fast position."

FLOOD PROJECT FACES DROUGHT OF STATE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is an awkward time for the people of the San Luis Rey River valley in 
Oceanside to ask for sympathy, let alone money and votes. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of drought, the valley with 4,000 residences and 100 
businesses is so parched that brittle scrub dots the wide banks of the low, 
seemingly unmenacing river. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the people live with the threat of deadly floods, which have struck before. 
They believe it's only a matter of time -- perhaps not much time -- until the 
drought ends and a torrential rain swells the river again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious they're overdue," said Jim Crum of the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, which is building an estimated $66-million flood-control project 
that's not expected to be completed for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
Already worried about being unprepared for the next inevitable flood, city 
officials and residents now have another reason for concern. Gov. George 
Deukmejian, trying to balance the budget, recently cut nearly $5 million from 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are alarmed about the project's possible delay. Although a bond 
measure on the Nov. 6 ballot would provide the revenue, skeptics wonder if 
statewide voters will approve the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming on the tail of a four-year drought, I question whether voters will be 
motivated to approve a bond measure" for flood-control projects, Oceanside 
Mayor Larry Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation does nothing to console Nancy Jakovac, who lives with her husband 
in a 122-unit condominium complex that is 4 feet above sea level and within 
viewing distance of the San Luis Rey River bed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a drought, and everybody believes they can play Russian roulette . . 
. ," she scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to floods, Jakovac knows her subject. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, as the Jakovacs prepared to move into their new 
condominium, they had no idea they had put themselves in harm's way until they 
signed the loan papers and were told they must get flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance cost $87 a year initially, but it has risen to $400 yearly now. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know (the river) was there. It was a drought year, so nobody 
even mentioned it was there," said Jakovac, who is on the city Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband soon learned about life on a flood basin. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, during heavy rains, they heard a loud noise and opened the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"The river was just roaring and tumbling out there. It was the scariest thing 
I've ever seen," she said. The water was 60 feet from the door. Her husband 
borrowed a bulldozer and hastily crafted a levee that neighbors secured with 
sandbags. Luckily, the river subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody pitched in to save our neighborhood," Jakovac said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there were floods in 1969, 1978, 1980 and 1983, claiming one 
life and causing $5.4 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the monetary cost was "relatively modest," said Dana Whitson, 
assistant to the city manager, the floods served as a reminder of what can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
The worst San Luis Rey River flood in memory hit in 1916, when three people 
were killed, bridges were washed out and the entire valley floor was inundated 
by a peak flow of 95,600 cubic feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
"The city was inaccessible for more than two weeks, except by boat," said 
Whitson, who is working on the flood-control project. A flood of that magnitude 
today would cause at least $100 million in damage and pose "a clear risk to 
loss of life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The project involves a rock-revetted double levee with a soft-bottom channel, 
parapet walls and drainage ponds along a 7.2-mile stretch of river from the 
ocean to the Murray Bridge. It also includes a 5-mile bicycle trail and a 
42-acre replacement habitat for the endangered least Bell's vireo. 
</P>
<P>
With the project one-third complete, funding is critical to begin the second 
construction phase next April. The third and last phase is scheduled to be 
finished in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The federal share of the project is about $47 million, with $13 million from 
the state and $5.8 million from Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
But Oceanside suffered a setback when Deukmejian, in a battle with the 
Legislature to balance the state budget, vetoed funding that included $4.6 
million for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The funds were intended to reimburse Oceanside for money it spent to cover a 
portion of the state's part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The city has spent $1.5 million and expected to spend another $5.25 million 
this fiscal year to buy property for the project. The property purchases were 
to be covered as part of the state's portion of the program. 
</P>
<P>
But the reimbursement hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley wrote to Deukmejian urging him to approve legislation to put a 
flood-control bond issue for projects statewide on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the loss of assured funding for this year is a major blow in our 
effort to construct the (project's second phase) as scheduled in spring, 1991," 
said Bagley. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley got his wish Wednesday when legislation placing the bond measure on the 
ballot, Proposition 148, passed the deadline without being vetoed by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
However, it didn't get Deukmejian's signature, indicating he is willing to put 
the measure on the ballot but might not personally support it. The governor has 
said he is concerned about the amount of bonded debt the state is creating.

RENOWNED BIOLOGIST TO LEAVE UCSD FOR TEXAS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A noted molecular biologist and pioneer in cancer genetics is leaving UC San 
Diego to found a University of Texas institute in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Wen-Hwa Lee, 39, will give up a professorship in UCSD's School of Medicine to 
become professor and director at the Institute of Biotechnology at the 
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The development marks the second time this summer that the medical school has 
learned it is losing a top researcher. Dr. Ivor Royston has notified UCSD 
officials that on Nov. 1 he will leave his positions as professor and director 
of clinical immunology to help found a private cancer institute. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials did not return phone calls to ask about their reaction to the 
developments, which are unusual because UCSD more often is the recruiter rather 
than the loser in research personnel shifts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Lee's research group was the first to determine the chemical sequence 
of the retinoblastoma gene, which had shortly before been identified by a 
Massachusetts group. Children born without two copies of the gene develop 
cancer of the retina. 
</P>
<P>
However, work by Lee and others since then has led researchers to believe that 
its absence is also responsible for certain families being prone to breast 
cancer and prostate cancer, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Texas officials will not talk in detail about the salary offered to Lee to 
relocate. (His salary at UCSD is $105,210 for the 1990-91 academic year.) 
</P>
<P>
However, they did set before him an attractive and unusual package of research 
space, equipment and scientific freedom. The San Antonio campus had twice 
before tried to recruit Lee, but without the lures that the institute position 
will offer. 
</P>
<P>
"His mandate is excellent science. And the prescription for that is one that he 
will write," said Dr. John P. Howe III, president of the health science center. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said Lee will have free rein to decide: 
</P>
<P>
* His arrival date at his new job. 
</P>
<P>
* What research interests he and other scientists at the institute will pursue. 
</P>
<P>
* How to spend $5 million in equipment money the state is giving the institute, 
and how to allocate the lab space in a 60,000-square-foot building, at least a 
third of which would be occupied by Lee and his staff. By contrast, Lee now has 
about 2,500 square feet at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
* How many members of his research team can go with him to San Antonio and at 
what academic level, with the university picking up the costs. Among an 
estimated 25 people who will leave UCSD for the institute is his wife, Eva Lee, 
a biochemist and scientific collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Bailey, chairman of the UCSD pathology department that Lee is 
leaving, was surprised Friday when told that Lee had accepted the Texas job. To 
his knowledge, he said, there was no opportunity for UCSD to make a 
counteroffer to keep the Lees in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we known that he was going for certain, there certainly would have been 
serious discussions," Bailey said. "I deeply regret their going. It's a 
tremendous loss, not only for the School of Medicine but for the University of 
California in general." 
</P>
<P>
Lee was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Two previous times, Lee turned down a job at the San Antonio campus after UCSD 
officials made concessions. The most recent time, about a year ago, he was 
given about a third more lab space, Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular time I was unaware that the discussions were as serious as 
they obviously seem to have been, so we did not have the opportunity to do 
that," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, even with a new science building being built at UCSD, UCSD's 
facilities clearly would not be as spacious as the new San Antonio institute's 
building. At San Antonio, Lee's group of about 2 dozen will be at most a third 
of the total research staff -- giving them at least 20,000 square feet of 
space, nearly 10 times what they have at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey said the loss is an example of how difficult it is for public 
institutions to compete against privately financed efforts. The San Antonio 
institute's building was built with $20 million in donated money, including 
part of a $15-million grant given by Texas entrepreneur Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
Still, UCSD is not innocent of conducting its own privately financed academic 
raids. In March, for instance, it used drug-company money to create an 
Institute on Aging and recruit a leading researcher at Scripps Clinic, Dr. 
Dennis Carson, to move there. 
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, the new biotechnology institute is a key element in an economic 
development plan conceived during the Texas oil bust of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The institute will be situated on 50 acres in the rolling hills west of San 
Antonio, around which will be built the Texas Research Park. Under a nonprofit 
board, the research park will seek biotech tenants and help spin off new 
companies from the research conducted at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Howe attributes Lee's acceptance of the position to his recognition that he 
will be building a research center from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
"At how many universities in the '90s do you have the opportunity to do that?" 
Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was offered the job after an extensive interview and recruitment process 
over the past two years. He won the job over Dr. Ralph Arlinghaus of the 
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Howe noted that a search committee and leading medical researchers agreed on 
Lee's outstanding credentials as a scientist. Among them was Dr. Joseph 
Goldstein, who won a Nobel Prize for his research on atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Joe who sat in my office a year ago and said, 'Wen-Hwa Lee is a very 
special person in American science, and it would be tremendous if he were to 
come to Texas," Howe said. "So, over the past year, there's just been lots of 
excitement about attracting him here." 
</P>
<P>
Lee and his wife, who received their doctorates at UC Berkeley, are natives of 
Taiwan. They have two children.

SIGNS WARNING AGAINST EATING FISH FROM BAY TO BE POSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly three months after a study found that pregnant women should not eat fish 
caught in the San Diego Bay, county health officials decided Friday to post 
warning signs to alert fishermen to the dangers of their catch, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, said Gary R. Stephany, the county's deputy director of 
environmental health services, about eight signs will appear at local fishing 
piers and boat launch areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish from the bay may contain chemicals believed to cause cancer and birth 
defects," the signs will read in English, Spanish and Vietnamese, Stephany 
said. "Eating these fish may be a risk to some people. For more information, 
please call 338-2222." 
</P>
<P>
In June, when the results of the two-year $309,000 study were first released, 
county officials said they would wait for state health officials to evaluate it 
before posting fishing areas. Stephany said county officials scrapped that plan 
Friday when it became clear that other pressing issues may push the state's 
evaluation back too far. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerry Pollock, a staff toxicologist at the state Department of Health 
Services, confirmed that he does not expect to get to the San Diego Bay fish 
study until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very limited staff," he said. "It's not forever. There are some things 
I would tell you would be two years away." 
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the San Diego Unified Port District and conducted by the 
county Department of Health Services, found potentially harmful levels of 
mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemicals suspected of 
causing cancer, in the muscle and liver tissues of the 340 fish collected at 
four sites around the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers concluded that a person would have to eat 6 ounces of contaminated 
fish each day for 70 years before an adverse health effect could occur. They 
compared the cancer risk from eating bay fish to that posed by eating tainted 
peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference called to explain the results in June, county officials 
had been careful not to spark widespread panic by tempering their warnings with 
exclamations about how much the bay has improved. But, when it came to painting 
signs in three languages, space limitations left little room for subtlety, 
Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, it would have been nice to have a sign up there that wouldn't 
(prompt) a lot of phone calls," Stephany said. "But the risk analysis was so 
complicated that we couldn't figure out how to say, 'If you're pregnant, don't 
eat it, if you're young, two times a week is probably OK, and if you're an 
adult, four or five times is probably OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "Trying to fit all that on a sign is not an easy thing to do. But 
we wanted to inform people of the risks as clearly as we could."

EX-GOMPERS TEACHER ADMITS TO MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former veteran teacher at Gompers Secondary School pleaded guilty Friday to 
two counts of misdemeanor child molestation in a plea-bargain agreement that 
almost guarantees he will not serve time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney J. Loveless Jr., 54, admitted to Municipal Judge Gale Kaneshiro that he 
molested two girls younger than 18 between Sept. 5, 1989, and April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plea bargain, 10 felony counts of child molestation against Loveless 
were dismissed. Loveless said in court that he made his plea in order to avoid 
the possibility of a long jail sentence if he was convicted of the felony 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Loveless, could get up to two years in County Jail, will be sentenced Oct. 12, 
but Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said in court that he will recommend 
community service. Loveless, however, will be required to register as a sex 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Gompers, an award-winning magnet school, came under fire 
earlier this year for their handling of allegations of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have said they uncovered as many as 30 victims in their 
investigation.

USDA INVESTIGATING DEATHS OF 25 PUPPIES LEFT UNATTENDED ON JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday it is investigating the deaths 
of more than 2 dozen purebred puppies found dead aboard a United Airlines 
flight from Chicago to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When Flight 141 landed at Lindbergh Field about 3 p.m. Thursday, 24 dead 
puppies were found in the cargo area, said Rob Doughty, a United spokesman in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Another puppy died later at a San Diego veterinary clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Airline executives suspect that the puppies might have died from overheating. 
The plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem for two hours, and no one 
unloaded them, Doughty said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the upper 90s were reported in Chicago on Thursday, and near 
the plane the mercury hovered near 100 degrees, Doughty said. 
</P>
<P>
The puppies were part of a shipment of 27 puppies and two kittens going to a 
kennel in San Diego. Officials would not release the name of the kennel. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 141 was scheduled to take off from O'Hare International Airport shortly 
before 11 a.m. Chicago time Thursday, but an engine heating problem kept the 
DC-8 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When the plane returned for repairs, it went to a different gate, and the 
original ground crew that handled the animals was not there and did not know 
the plane had never taken off, Doughty said. 
</P>
<P>
During the repairs, he said, proper airline procedures apparently were not 
followed. They would have included opening the door to ventilate the cargo hull 
or checking to see if animals were on board. 
</P>
<P>
"If our procedures had been followed, this should not have happened," Doughty 
said, adding that United ships more than 60,000 animals a year. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Doughty said, animals are unloaded from a plane and taken to a cool 
holding area if the delay is longer than 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of six of the puppies were turned over Friday to the office of the 
San Diego County Veterinarian for necropsies, said Denise Bradley, an animal 
health technician for the county veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
The six, no more than 8 weeks old, were a husky, a Labrador retriever, a 
Shetland sheep dog, a Shih Tzu, a poodle and a beagle. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the necropsies will not be available for a couple of weeks, Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It will also take a couple of weeks for the Department of Agriculture to 
complete its investigation, said Dr. William DeHaven, a sector supervisor for 
the department's animal care division in Sacramento. The department enforces 
the Animal Welfare Act, which includes regulations for shipping animals in 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the act, the temperature where animals are kept should not be 
higher than 85 degrees or lower than 45. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs can become overheated when the temperature around them grows hotter than 
about 110 degrees, because they cannot cool their bodies effectively by 
panting, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Overheating is the common cause of death for animals who are left in 
unventilated cars during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
If United Airlines is found at fault, penalties can range from a warning letter 
to suspension of their registration to carry animals, DeHaven said. 
</P>
<P>
But he backed away from any speculation on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not pointing the finger and not saying anyone is guilty at this point in 
time."

UCSD GRAD TO REPLACE CHIEF OF NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>

Hugh Hewitt, executive director of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, 
will step down as head of California's first presidential library to resume 
practicing law full time, a library spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, who oversaw the library's opening ceremonies that drew four presidents 
and dozens of local and national dignitaries to Yorba Linda on July 19, will be 
replaced by John H. Taylor, Nixon's chief of staff for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who will take over as executive director of the library Sept. 17, "is 
the natural choice for the library," said library spokesman Kevin Cartwright. 
"He's worked with President Nixon for 10 years, and he knows the President's 
record. He's very anxious to come out here. It's a great opportunity for both 
John and the library." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 35, a graduate of Andover College and UC San Diego, joined Nixon's 
staff in 1980, Cartwright said. He is the author of "Patterns of Abuse: A Novel 
of Politics and Power," published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who Cartwright said will move to Yorba Linda with his wife, Marsha, and 
two children from New Jersey, where Nixon maintains an office in Saddle River, 
was not available for comment Friday. Hewitt also was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Although his association with the library was brief, Hewitt stirred national 
controversy when he told The Times a week before the library's opening that 
researchers would be screened, and those seen as anti-Nixon would be denied 
access to the former President's papers and records. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt singled out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who won a Pulitzer 
Prize with colleague Carl Bernstein for coverage of the Watergate scandal, as 
one potential researcher who would be denied access to the facility. "He's not 
a responsible journalist," Hewitt said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The screening policy was rescinded after protests from scholars and journalists 
across the country. Hewitt said he revoked the plan because he had imposed it 
without first consulting Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials on Friday said that Hewitt's resignation as executive 
director was planned several months ago and was not connected to the screening 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"For many, many months he's been concentrating on the successful opening of the 
library," Cartwright said. "He wants to devote his full time to his law 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt will return to the law firm of Pettis, Tester, Kruse &amp; Krinsky in 
Irvine, Cartwright said.

Tony Gwynn hears the whispers behind his back. He listens to the taunts from 
the stands. He even is tormented by rude comments to his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they're saying about me," Gwynn said. "I hear all the jokes, all 
the laughs. People want me to fall on my face. They keep waiting for me to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, after eight years, I'm still here, aren't I?" 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, who went hitless in four at-bats Friday in the Padres 4-1 loss to the 
Atlanta Braves in front a paid crowd of 12,449 at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium, is having what is perceived as the worst season of his professional 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Braves starter Charlie Leibrandt checked the Padres on four hits for the 100th 
victory of his career. Ed Whitson (12-8) was the loser for the first time in 
nine starts 
</P>
<P>
This is September, a time of year in which Gwynn annually is fighting for the 
batting championship. But instead of envisioning a batting title, Gwynn is 
struggling just to hit .300. He's three for 20 on the home stand and his 
batting average is down to .306 after Friday's game, its lowest point since May 
8. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, the only time he ever has finished with a batting average lower than .309 
was his rookie season in 1982, when he batted .289, and that was only in 54 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn says he has nothing to be ashamed of, but when you have four batting 
championship trophies sitting at home and enter the season with a career .331 
batting average, people just aren't used to this kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
And everyone seems to be pointing fingers at what they believe is the source 
behind all his problems: 
</P>
<P>
His weight. 
</P>
<P>
It's OK for Charles Barkley, who lovingly is called the Round Mound of Rebound. 
The Refrigerator made a killing in endorsements with his size. But ol' Tony, 
all he hears is abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The man stands 5-feet-10, tips the scales at 217 pounds, and has a paunch that 
most middle-aged Americans would be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
But Gwynn is a major league ballplayer, and for every time he grounds out, and 
for every fly ball he can't get to in the outfield, everyone points out that 
the man is carrying too much weight. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't think I'm even trying," Gwynn said. "They think I sit by 
my TV every day with a can of beer in one hand, and a bag of potato chips in 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm trying, I'm trying. It's something that runs in my family. Really, 
even if I lost 10 pounds, I don't think I'd look a whole lot different." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after hearing all the criticism, friendly and otherwise, Gwynn revealed 
Friday that he plans to make amends about his body. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make a big deal out of this," Gwynn said. "I don't want people 
to think I'm going to come in weighing 185 pounds or something. But I plan to 
change my habits, get down to about 205. I plan to change my conditioning 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want another season like this, because to be honest with you, it's 
been very, very frustrating. It's been a year where I've struggled all year 
long." 
</P>
<P>
The key to Gwynn's physical-fitness routine, he says, will be basketball. He 
plans to shoot em up every day, running the length of the court, cutting and 
weaving, stopping and going. 
</P>
<P>
And you know what? He's not even going to lift a baseball bat until January. 
Maybe even February. Everyone will be looking for him at the San Diego School 
of Baseball and San Diego State, expecting him to be taking batting practice 
three times a week as soon as the season ends. Just like every year. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, it will be only Gwynn and his basketball. The owners can balk 
all they want about basketball being prohibited in his contract, but if they 
have something to say, Gwynn says to tell them to come to the court in his 
backyard. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, a lot of people over the years have talked to me about my weight," 
Gwynn said, "and this year, I've heard something from just about everybody. But 
it was Fred Lynn who finally convinced me. I look at him, and he's 38 years 
old, and he looks just like he did when he first came up to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Gwynn is stretching the truth a bit, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
He weighed 181 pounds when he came up to the big leagues in 1974. He now weighs 
182. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Tony about it," Lynn said, "and the thing is now with the money 
being so good, it's crazy not to get that extra year or two. You don't want to 
eat or drink yourself out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Until you're 30, you can do just about anything without it catching up to you. 
I mean, I wasn't one to drink milk and eat cookies every day, but boy, it 
catches up to you. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hit 30, like Tony is now, you've got to make sacrifices." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "You know, the funny thing about all this is that when I hit .370 
(in 1987), I weighed 215, and nobody said a thing to me. When I won the batting 
title last year, and weighed about the same, nobody said anything. Now, I don't 
hit like people expect, and everybody's talking. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I lose 15 pounds before next spring, it'lls shock everybody on 
earth, but I'll tell you something, it won't change me. I'm still going to have 
the same shape. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless I have surgery that's going to make by butt smaller, or take away my 
stomach, I'm still going to have the same type of body. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll give this a shot. I'll get in the best shape I can. I haven't had the 
kind of stamina I should all year, so maybe it'll help." 
</P>
<P>
And maybe, just maybe, the only thing fat about Tony Gwynn will be in his 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although speculation persists that the Atlanta Braves are interested in talking 
with Jack McKeon about their general manager opening, McKeon said Friday night 
that he has not been contacted by the Braves. McKeon, Padre vice 
president/baseball operations, last was interviewed by another club in 1987, 
for the general manager job with the Baltimore Orioles.

UNSUNG DEFENDERS COVER FOR RAMONA AS IT STOPS LINCOLN

<P>
The Ramona Bulldogs' monstrous offensive line was expected to dominate 
Lincoln's small, but quick defensive line. But holes were hard to come by for 
Ramona running backs Sarn Salmon and Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ramona's unheralded defensive front seven took it upon themselves to 
cover for their offensive line. Except for two big plays, they kept Lincoln's 
wide-open offense cooped up and set up two touchdowns to give fifth-ranked 
Ramona a 22-13 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't very pretty," Ramona Coach Mel Galli said, "but it's a starting 
point. I feel very fortunate to win." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Coach Vic Player, whose team lost its first game by more than 30 
points, said he felt fortunate to play a respectable game. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked like a football team for the first time this year," he said. "This 
gave us a great ray of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Despite rushing for only 20 yards in the first half, Ramona did put together a 
70-yard drive capped by quarterback John Cappasola's touchdown pass to tight 
end Ryan Simpson for 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona then took advantage of a botched Lincoln punt to get the ball on 
Lincoln's three. Salmon scored on the next play, taking it in off right tackle 
to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 14-0, at the half, Lincoln actually had its chances to 
win. Hornet wide receiver Scott Hammond broke loose to score two long 
touchdowns on short out passes from quarterback Mike Temple to cut the lead to 
14-13, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Only an incomplete halfback option pass kept Lincoln (0-2) from taking the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
After being stifled most of the game, Salmon, who finished with 110 yards in 26 
carries, ran through a huge hole in the left side of the line at the Lincoln 35 
for a touchdown to make it 22-13. DAVE McKIBBEN

MORSE'S REVENGE IS SWIFT; 
</P>
<P>
BIG GAME: IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE COUNTY'S TWO TOP-RATED TEAMS, MORSE SCORES 
A 28-14 VICTORY OVER RANCHO BUENA VISTA.

<P>
Nonleague games usually border on the meaningless, but the Rancho Buena 
Vista-Morse game Friday night at Mesa College was as big as nonleague games 
get. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams met last year in the 3-A San Diego Section championship, with RBV 
taking a 21-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the prep football season, No. 2 Morse scored an impressive 28-14 
victory over the No. 1 ranked Longhorns in front of 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
And since it was a big game, you may as well talk about the guy who had the 
biggest game of them all, Morse running back Gary Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Just a junior, Taylor rushed 10 times for 237 yards in the first half alone, 
scoring three touchdowns on runs of 75, 85 and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was called on just two more times in the second half and finished the 
night with 241 yards on 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been interesting had he been given the opportunity to break the 
3-A single-game rushing record of 366 set two years ago by Rancho's Scott 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
"I just do what the coach tells me," he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
His coach, John Shacklett, explained his reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were going to make an adjustment in the second half to control 
the outside, so when they shifted outside, that opened things up for the 
fullback," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fullback was Conan Smith, who carried eight times for 80 yards in the 
second half after running just three times for four yards in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor didn't play in last year's championship game, he knew the 
importance of this contest. Morse not only lost the championship to RBV, but 
lost to the champs earlier in the year too, 35-20, to open the prep season. 
</P>
<P>
"Revenge, that's what this game was about," he said. "Rancho's such a great 
opponent. We knew this wasn't a championship game, but we might see them again. 
I'm pretty sure we'll see them again." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second 200-yard game Taylor has had. Two weeks ago, Morse defeated 
Punahoe, Hawaii, 55-13, and he rushed 11 times for 204 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor scored on the second play of the game when he took a pitch from 
quarterback Teddy Lawrence, turned the corner and went 75 yards. He scored on 
Morse's fifth play of the game, on the next possession, going right on the 
pitch, then cutting back across the field for 85 yards. At that point, he had 
three carries for 166 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Morse scored on each of its four first-half possessions. Lawrence passed five 
yards to Glen Steele to make it 21-0 after Jose Villafana's third PAT. The 
drive was set up by the fourth of RBV's eight fumbles, but it was the only 
fumble the Longhorns lost. 
</P>
<P>
RBV pulled to 21-7 when Markeith Ross scored on a screen pass that covered 46 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing kickoff went out of bounds, giving Morse the ball at the Rancho 47. 
Four plays later, Taylor scored from the eight. The big play on the drive was a 
32-yard pass from Lawrence to Tommy Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Cormier scored from one yard out in the fourth quarter to complete the 
scoring.

OCCIDENTAL PRESENTS CHALLENGE FOR USD

<P>
Every year, it's something different. But every year, the result is the same. 
The University of San Diego, as good as it has been the past three years, can't 
seem to beat Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 at USD's Torero Stadium, USD will try again in both schools' 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, USD was 5-0 and leading Occidental, 17-7, at halftime when the 
Toreros ran into a little problem -- the Tigers' Gary Little. In the end, 
Little had 261 yards and two touchdowns, and Occidental had a 23-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That loss, combined with a 51-3 rout by UC Santa Barbara, knocked USD (7-2) out 
of the NCAA Division III playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, USD lost to Occidental, 20-16, after two Torero passes into the end 
zone fell incomplete. The second one -- with less than 10 seconds remaining -- 
was an apparent touchdown by receiver Ken Zampese, but officials ruled that 
Zampese had trapped the ball. Typical of that season, USD went 5-4 and had 
every loss determined in the game's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Occidental kicked a 35-yard field goal with no time remaining to tie 
the game, 13-13, and USD (6-3-1) missed the playoffs by one game. It was the 
closest USD had come to beating the Tigers since USD Coach Brian Fogarty began 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Fogarty (33-33-2) is well aware of that fact, but it doesn't eat at him. He 
isn't obsessed by the thought, and he doesn't feel winning or losing to 
Occidental will make or break this season or any other. Still, it would be nice 
to beat them once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Occidental and USD have been the top Division III 
teams in the Southland. And this year should be no different. 
</P>
<P>
USD returns 14 starters, including multiyear offensive starters Brendan Murphy 
at quarterback, Ty Barksdale at running back, Mike Hintze at tight end and Ray 
Smith at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
USD also has nine of 11 of last year's leading tacklers returning, including 
inside linebacker Lenny Territo (81 tackles) and defensive backs Darryl Jackson 
(61) and Darby Barrett (58). 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which was 7-2 and won the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference title, returns 13 starters, including "That guy who ran a 
million yards against us," as Fogarty referred to Little, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxy is a tough opener," Fogarty said. "We'll find out how good we are right 
away. But I like playing tough teams early. It gives us something to shoot 
for."

SPEED LEADS LYNWOOD PAST NOTRE DAME 
</P>

<P>
Notre Dame opened its season at home Friday night facing a particularly tough 
schedule that began with Lynwood High. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, the Knights jumped from Division VII to Division III and 
the difference a year can make was not lost on Coach Kevin Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if Friday night actually were a playoff game, Notre Dame would be done 
for the season after losing to a faster Lynwood team, 28-15. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood's Eugene Jackson, starting his first-ever game at quarterback, 
completed five of nine passes for 161 yards and rushed 14 times for 67 yards. 
Jackson ran for three of his team's touchdowns and threw for the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing quarterback for the first time, looking over that line, I was very 
Nervous," Jackson said. "Thank God we have good receivers and good running 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame started the game well. On the Knights' first possession, they drove 
69 yards in 10 plays, getting a key fourth-down conversion on Lynwood's 40-yard 
line. Setefano Malieitulua dived over from the one. 
</P>
<P>
But almost as soon as Notre Dame kicked off, the momentum swung. 
</P>
<P>
On consecutive plays, Jackson threw 32 yards to Juaquin Hawkins and 47 yards to 
Jock Ingram, the second pass going for a touchdown that tied the score at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
After this aerial opening, Lynwood settled into its veer offense and, on the 
next two possessions, grinded out touchdown drives of 93 and 78 yards. Lynwood 
running back Theodore Anderson finished the evening with 13 carries for 122 
yards, but it was Jackson who hogged the glory, running for the score both 
times as Lynwood took a 21-7 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame started the second half in much the same fashion as the first, by 
scoring. Justin Mitchell's one-yard touchdown run capped a 73-yard drive that 
was highlighted by quarterback Steve Colella's passing. Mitchell ran for a 
two-point conversion to make the score, 21-15. 
</P>
<P>
But a fourth-quarter Lynwood touchdown and three quarterback sacks by 
linebacker Fred Mailoto preserved the victory for the visiting team.
