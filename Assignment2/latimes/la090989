AL MARTINEZ: STARS BEYOND A MOUNTAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
I have a friend named Travis who began his first day of school this week. 
</P>
<P>
He strode out the door of his house in a Batman T-shirt, new hiking shorts and 
electric-blue sneakers that glow in the dark. A G.I. Joe lunch box was clasped 
firmly by the handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you headed?" I joked as we walked down Chelsea Street on a morning as 
sweet as honey in tea. 
</P>
<P>
"School!" Travis said proudly, holding his arms out and veering up on a lawn 
like a jet soaring through the brilliant cerulean sky. There was the aroma of 
freshly mowed grass in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you feel about that?" I said, hurrying to keep up with the jet. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny," Travis said. Then he added, "Oh me, oh my." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you feel funny?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm going to have fun!" 
</P>
<P>
The jet soared around a rose bush and paralleled the sidewalk again. 
</P>
<P>
"I see. It's fun so you feel fun-ny. That makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
School for the Castaic District began Thursday. The rest of L.A. County goes 
back next week; more than a million students marching like an army of hope and 
anguish through doors that lead beyond the looking glass. 
</P>
<P>
"The raft of knowledge," a Hindu philosopher said, "ferries the worst of us to 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
The raft edged up to the door of my grandson's kindergarten class and stopped. 
His jet circled the field and landed. 
</P>
<P>
The journey had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Excitement was in the air when Travis awoke that morning. The first day of 
school is no small thing. Mt. Everest awaited, and the stars beyond the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Daring, you see, is no longer limited to climbing mountains. Time has altered 
the nature of metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
But was it so long ago that my own children were going off to their first day 
of school, when the space age was young? It doesn't seem so, but the years 
collapse in hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the look on my son's face the blustery day he strode to the great 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
He walked from the house and paused, gazing back at toys scattered on the front 
lawn. His eyes said goodby to infancy more poignantly than words could ever 
express. 
</P>
<P>
He knew that nothing would be the same anymore. 
</P>
<P>
It was that way with Travis. He inspected his play yard like a general bidding 
farewell to an army. He said goodby to his dog Chopper and to the kitten, 
Cream. He peeked into his fort and patted his slide set. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you expect from today?" I asked as he got ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what would you like to do in school?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled slightly. It was a game. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," I said, "then what will you eat for lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing on crackers," Travis said, laughing. It had the sound of wind chimes 
on the summer air. Then he added, suddenly realizing, "I won't be eating at 
home." The laughter faded. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," the teacher said, "everyone line up for name tags. Name tags, 
everyone!" 
</P>
<P>
Her name tag said she was Miss Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
She was maybe 25. Were my teachers in their 20s when I started school? 
Probably. But everyone seems old when you're 5. Now everyone seems young. 
</P>
<P>
"Step lively," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie got in line and so did Christopher and Zachary, Albert and Cory, Elsa 
and Antonio and Ryan and John . . . 
</P>
<P>
Travis inspected the room. He opened drawers and looked in cabinets. He checked 
out a play stove and studied his name at a table. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," I whispered. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to school," he whispered back. 
</P>
<P>
Well, true. But I still liked it. I liked it because the class was bilingual, 
and a blend of language is the future of the world. 
</P>
<P>
I liked it because there was youth in the room and hope in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan, Nadine, Patricia, Jose, Ashley, Erica, Marcos, Darlene, Rozendo . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I realize that a small school in suburbia is not a microcosm of America. There 
is privilege here and reason for optimism. That isn't true everywhere. Hope is 
rare in the ghettos, and purchased with trepidation in the barrios. 
</P>
<P>
That might change someday, but I don't know that it will. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," Miss Prescott said, "time for class!" 
</P>
<P>
The mothers and fathers hugged their kids. The blue door of Room 2 began to 
close. But before it did, I glimpsed a sign on the wall. It said, "Goodby, 
summer! Hello, fall!" Adios, verano! Hola, ontono! 
</P>
<P>
And I realized that another summer was fading and another passage had been 
achieved. Travis, the infant, was gone, and a little boy was reaching for the 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Oh me . . . oh my.

WHAT'S UP IN TUOLUMNE MEADOWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next to Yosemite Valley, the subalpine Tuolumne Meadows is the most crowded and 
heavily used part of Yosemite National Park. Everyone entering the park from 
the east must drive from Lee Vining over Tioga Pass and down through the 
meadows. It is a popular camping area, is bisected by the John Muir Trail and 
is the center of rock-climbing activity in the Sierra Nevada during the 
summertime. The meadows is the site of one of the Yosemite Park and Curry Co. 
's High Sierra camps and is the departure point for others. And the meadows are 
attracting increasing crowds of touring skiers during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
During the next six weeks, Yosemite administrators and the National Park 
Service will be taking an intensive look at development in the Tuolumne Meadows 
area, in part to meet requirements of the 1980 Yosemite master plan, but also 
to comply with the 1984 California Wilderness Act that incorporated portions of 
the Tuolumne River into the national wild- and scenic-river system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the options the park service should consider carefully are relocation of 
tourist facilities and the meadows campground away from both Tioga Road and the 
river, in part to relieve traffic congestion but also to restore some of the 
wilderness feeling to the river banks. Meadow restoration is a must, although 
it may mean that some areas will have to be put off-limits to hikers for a 
time. One concept that should not be considered is the widening of Route 120 to 
carry more traffic, as has been proposed at times in the past. Parking, 
however, has become a major problem that must be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
For many park visitors, including those from foreign lands, a trip to or 
through Tuolumne Meadows and over 9,941-foot Tioga Pass is as close as they 
will get to a high-mountain wilderness. That experience will be lost without 
reasonable restraint on the sort of development and congestion that blights the 
natural wonders of this fine mountain region.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I admire President Bush for wanting to keep his word to the American people in 
regards to not raising new taxes, but never has a President been given the 
opportunity to "break" his word and find the majority of the people ready to 
say "we back your retraction." Now having declared war on drugs, he must put 
aside his promise or that war will be lost. Who is paying the $7.9 billion 
inadequate budget he now proposes? The taxpayer! 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayer wants to win this war and would rather win without having other 
vital domestic programs cut to finance it. Does President Bush honestly believe 
we want the addicts, pushers and drug lords to continue destroying our nation 
while he wrings his hands in frustration, telling us, "I must keep my word at 
all costs?" This is war! 
</P>
<P>
When he finds the budget he has proposed is woefully inadequate, America may 
have to admit we have lost another war. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Mr. President, ask us for permission to break your promise. You will 
get a resounding cry of support -- provided the tax monies are used effectively 
against what is proving to be the great threat to America at this time -- 
drugs! 
</P>
<P>
Let's not lose this one!

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TACTICS OF OPERATION RESCUE LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost as offensive as Operation Rescue's "abuse of the heroic moral tradition 
of civil disobedience" ("Impersonating Integrity," editorial, Aug. 31) is its 
use of what Orwell could have included in his definition of "doublespeak" in 
the courtroom and any other public forum its leaders can get their misguided 
hands in. In Operation Rescue's doublespeak, family practitioners become 
"abortionists" and "baby killers." Family health clinics become "killing 
factories" and "abortionaries." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon calls MX missiles "peacekeepers." And though we may even follow 
the logic of that phrase, it is still harmful. It is a very subtle and 
deceitful way of molding the way the public thinks and feels. Words are 
powerful tools. If we all call bombs "peacekeepers" long enough, maybe we'll 
forget that people will be hurt and killed by them. 
</P>
<P>
Judge A. Wallace Tashima should be praised for his intolerance of Operation 
Rescue's doublespeak in his courtroom.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding President Bush's drug speech: 
</P>
<P>
First I read in the paper what he was going to say. 
</P>
<P>
Then I heard on the news what he was going to say. 
</P>
<P>
Then I heard on the news what he did say (with sound bites), what he should or 
could have said, and what it all means, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
Then I read in the paper what he did say (with verbatim quotes), what he should 
or could have said, and what it all means, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
In between there President Bush may actually have made a speech, though why he 
would bother is beyond me. The speech itself seems to be the least important 
part of the process. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder we are losing our ability to make decisions based on our own 
experience -- we are being denied the opportunity to have our own experience.

President Bush gave us a very elegant speech on how he was going to fight the 
use of drugs. Let us not forget that as vice president he was in charge of the 
drug program and in eight years the use of drugs increased in the United 
States.

Certain city council members, judges and police officials seem almost obsessed 
with stopping the anti-abortion "rescuers" who nonviolently block abortion 
centers to save unborn babies, and commit minor offenses in the process. 
</P>
<P>
When will these public officials show similar enthusiasm for stopping: 
</P>
<P>
* The open selling of deadly drugs to children on our street corners. 
</P>
<P>
* The thousands of burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, rapes and murders 
committed yearly, especially against the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
* The widespread selling and renting of X-rated videos, distributed by 
organized crime, that violate our state's new anti-pornography law. 
</P>
<P>
* The killing and maiming of hundreds of citizens by drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Police and judicial resources are limited. They should be used to punish real 
criminals, not peaceful protesters whose cause is politically unpopular in City 
Hall.

In 1977 at a gathering of friends, I can remember clearly stating that I might 
some day go to jail for not paying my taxes or because of some other form of 
civil disobedience. There was then no avenue to act within the democratic 
process to alter the law decreed by the Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade. 
Constitutional action was and remains, in large part, the only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
I still struggle with this inclination, but Operation Rescue has certainly 
given like-minded people (the opportunity) to express ourselves in a meaningful 
manner. Operation Rescue started prior to (the Supreme Court decision in) 
Webster vs. Reproductive Services and has not returned full authority to the 
democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
The morality of issues like slavery, expansionist wars, nuclear weapons, civil 
rights and abortion do not always lend themselves to polite parlor talk and 
abstract concepts like plurality. We will always have diversity of opinion, but 
some issues are important enough to take an unpopular stand on in order to 
bring about change. Civil rights in the U.S. and the end of colonialism in 
India were brought to a head by civil disobedience. Their leaders were not 
seeking jail as an end, but accepting it as a means toward the just societies 
they sought. The state structures did not allow for the moral right to be 
brought into being. 
</P>
<P>
Today, pro-life people are cut off, not only by Roe vs. Wade, but also by the 
national media that are clearly pro-choice and refusing to express on equal 
terms the pro-life argument. I applaud Operation Rescue and the efforts of all 
within the pro-life movement. They are valiantly reopening the American mind on 
this most important political and moral issue. 
</P>
<P>
You will not find a higher state of integrity today in any collective group 
than within the pro-life movement in general and Operation Rescue in 
particular.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's drug package doesn't even begin to address the social issues 
related to drug addiction and abuse. He is basically asking Congress to take 
money from already existing social programs and spend it to fight the war on 
drugs. Most of the states like New York and California are already plagued with 
other serious problems (crime, poverty, homelessness, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
Bush is taking a big risk by waging a war he may not win with this modest 
package. I don't think Americans would object to a surtax to be used only for 
the war on drugs, including education. Certainly it would be money well spent 
and it would cost us less in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership means making tough decisions during tough times. Yes, we've read his 
lips. It's time he read ours.

'RETHINKING SCHOOL CHOICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The solution to most of Hughes' concerns over open enrollment-school choice 
proposals is one of LAUSD's success stories: magnet schools. Simply make all 
LAUSD schools magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
Magnet schools are balanced racially by quota. Selection is by lottery within 
those quotas. LAUSD already uses a simple brochure and application which is 
circulated to all parents. No independent advertising should be necessary or 
allowed.

BASEBALL FANS MOURN LOSS OF COMMISSIONER WITH GENUINE SORROW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the shock wears off, Bart Giamatti's memory will turn into an everlasting 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
In his five months as commissioner, he proved to us that nobody could take away 
the pride and integrity of major league baseball. But most of all, he 
demonstrated to us how we should protect the game. His respect and love for the 
game showed us the perfect commissioner. We should take note, because we need 
more people in this world like Bart Giamatti.

NOW, BASEBALL MUST TACKLE THE DRUG ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pete Rose stonewalled his accusers with the standard "denial" response, 
the late Bart Giamatti, very properly, played hardball with him. No 
first-offense warning, no temporary suspension, just the maximum penalty -- 
banned for life. 
</P>
<P>
The next commissioner will be faced with a period in which this country and 
much of the world is attempting to deal effectively with our No. 1 problem -- 
drug abuse. Let him act just as decisively as his predecessor against even more 
serious offenses on which Peter Ueberroth failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
Any player found using illegal drugs should face immediate suspension from 
baseball for life, period.

It was questioned, "How could a non-baseball man lead our game into the 1990s?"

With his death I feel a great loss, for he was not only the leader of my

Circle K Corp.: The Phoenix-based convenience store chain said first-quarter 
net income fell 39% to $7.6 million from a year ago. Revenue rose 24% to $1.02 
billion. The company said higher interest and depreciation costs related to an 
expansion program kept profits lower than in last year's first quarter. 
However, it also noted that after losing money in the final quarter of fiscal 
1989, the company did return to profitability.

DOW INDEX EDGES HIGHER AFTER A 3-DAY RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market ended a three-day losing streak Friday after firm U.S. bond 
prices and computer-directed buying lifted sagging shares to a higher close. 
</P>
<P>
However, the small advance was unable to offset the market's earlier losses and 
the Dow Jones industrial index ended the week lower, halting a nine-week 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Dow index, which was down 22 points at one stage Friday, recovered 
to finish up 2.66 points at 2,709.54. For the week, it dropped 42.55 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10 to 9 in the daily tally of 
nationwide trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 746 up, 685 
down and 552 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.09 million shares, down from 
160.16 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from declines in open market 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But doubts persisted about the chances for any concerted move in the near 
future by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy further. 
</P>
<P>
That view, in turn, has reinforced suspicions among many market participants 
that stocks might be due for a pullback after their strong advance through the 
first eight months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers say the market's rise to record highs in late August also may have 
touched off some selling by investors who had been waiting "get out even" after 
suffering large paper losses in the crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
F. W. Woolworth made the biggest contribution to the Dow's gain, climbing 3 to 
71 3/4. The company declined comment on persistent speculation in the market 
about a possible takeover or restructuring move. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose 3/4 to 49 7/8 and 
Exxon gained 1/8 to 44 3/8, while General Electric slipped 1/8 to 56 1/2 and 
International Business Machines was down 1/4 at 116. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks continued their recent pullback after a dramatic run-up this 
summer on buyout news and rumors. UAL lost 1 1/2 to 280 1/4, AMR fell 1 5/8 to 
81 and Delta Air Lines retreated 3/4 to 74 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott Laboratories added 1 1/8 to 62 7/8. The company repeated projections of 
record sales and earnings this year, and said directors authorized it to buy 
back as many as 10 million of its common shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market closed slightly lower on wobbly legs after a roller 
coaster ride in moderately active trading. The Nikkei 225-share index fell for 
the fourth straight day, easing 36.75 points to 34,115.81. The index initially 
rose and then fell sharply from its highs. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed higher on London's stock market. The Financial 
Times 100-share index closed up 8 points at 2,423.9. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in quiet trading, tipped higher by economic statistics that 
were seen as an indication of a possible economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/8 point, or $3.75 for every $1,000 
in face value. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, dropped to 8.08% 
from 8.10% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were supported by consumer installment credit figures released 
Friday, said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a general economic slowdown due to Fed efforts to stem inflation, 
consumer spending -- which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity -- has 
continued at a relatively fast pace. A reduction in credit could indicate that 
consumers are slowing their spending pace. 
</P>
<P>
Americans paid off $280 million more in credit than they borrowed during July, 
the first reduction in consumer debt in 2 1/2 years, the Federal Reserve Board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.938%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar approached the peaks reached in its June rally as a comment by a 
Swiss national banker gave fresh confidence to bullish dealers in a thin 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Zwahlen, a member of the Swiss National Bank's governing board, was quoted 
as saying that the dollar is likely to rise in the immediate future based on 
the strength of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Zwahlen also was quoted as saying the ability of central banks to restrain the 
dollar's rise depends on the strength of market sentiment toward the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was given another boost by a rumor, later denied by the Soviet 
embassy in Washington, that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had died, 
said Lynn Tierney, a vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to 146.62 Japanese yen from 146.87 yen late Thursday. Later, in London, it 
was quoted at a lower rate of 146.45 yen. In New York, the dollar moved up to 
147.20 yen from 146.65 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5505 to buy 
one pound, more expensive than $1.5460 late Thursday. In New York, the dollar 
gained ground as the pound fell to $1.5380 from $1.5520. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices staged a strong rally, bursting through the $6-a-bushel 
barrier on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of Soviet demand for soybean 
meal and rising fears of a rain-delayed harvest. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, coffee and energy futures rose while livestock, meat and 
precious metals retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 1.25 cents to 10.75 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in September at $6.075 a bushel, the highest settlement for a 
near-month soybean contract since Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 0.75 cent to 1.50 cents lower, with September at $3.955 a 
bushel; corn was 0.25 cent to 3 cents higher, with September at $2.395 a 
bushel, and oats were 1 cent to 1.75 cents higher, with September at $1.38 a 
bushel.

PASSE RECORDINGS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFAC-FM's change from classical music to rock and the parceling out of its 
record library may be a lot of things, but it is not comparable to the burning 
of Alexandria (as Arthur C. O'Bryne wrote in Saturday Letters, Sept. 2). In the 
year 415, Christians began the greatest book burning in history by torching the 
Alexandrian library, in which was stored virtually the accumulated science and 
literature of the Western world. We have little idea what masterpieces were 
lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
If the older recordings of KFAC are never heard again, I don't know what kind 
of loss that would be, if a loss at all. Recordings that I once thought 
definitive now sound frustratingly old. The Budapest Quartet is technically 
sloppy. David Oistrakh may have been a great musician but his sound is thin and 
weak. Rubinstein just plays too fast, and the recording quality on his RCA 
records is dull and muddy. Heifetz sounds ridiculous when he uses chamber works 
as technical vehicles. Even the great orchestral recordings by Szell and Reiner 
don't have the transparency and brightness of some of today's CDs.

HOLLYWOOD AS CENSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his Aug. 29 article "Box-Office Short Circuit for 'Wired,' " Jack Mathews 
gives striking information about an apparently widespread desire within the 
Hollywood community to prevent the public from seeing the film about John 
Belushi. 
</P>
<P>
Flashback to summer of 1988: Controversy rages around the film treatment of 
another public figure for whom people have highly personal feelings -- Jesus 
Christ. A movement forms to halt release of Martin Scorsese's "The Last 
Temptation of Christ." In reaction, the creative arena is outraged, labeling 
the protesters enemies of art and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
If the creative community is willing to use its power to suppress any 
"distasteful" project, how effective will it be in protecting its art the next 
time the specter of censorship arises? The defenders of art must be credible!

A PLACE FOR BEETHOVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 25 years ago when the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra moved to the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from its old hall at Fifth and Olive, it left behind 
in the north end of adjacent Pershing Square the statue of Ludwig van 
Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Sculpted by A. Foerster and dedicated to William Andrews Clark Jr., founder of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it was erected by the personnel of the orchestra 
and presented to the people of Los Angeles in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
The statue of this most famous and respected composer deserves a place of 
honor, not in a square named for a military general but rather at the Los 
Angeles County Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Philharmonic will move into the Walt Disney Hall, to be constructed in 
the Music Center complex. Surely the Disney Hall committee will now seize the 
opportunity to relocate the Beethoven statue to the grounds of the facility.

FACES. . .: 'WEBA' IS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weba Garretson dons -- and discards -- a stageful of veils in "Weba and her 
Wailing Turbans," a self-described "musical extravaganza-loony cabaret" opening 
Thursday at Cafe Largo in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The setting is sort of a Hollywood cartoon version of an Arabian lair," 
explains the Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter. Garretson will be accompanied 
by the Wailing Turbans (Keith Joe Dick and John Garretson), with local color 
provided by fez-wearing waiters, an opening night appearance by the Oriental 
Beledy Dance Troup -- and on the menu, a special Weba version of couscous, "a 
definite departure, of course, from the traditional couscous." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Westchester County, N.Y., Garretson -- who co-wrote this show with 
Steve Stewart -- credits an experimental theater program at Sarah Lawrence 
College for opening her eyes to post-collegiate theatrical possibilities. Yet, 
although she's long been associated with performance art projects (the 
notorious "Weba Show" was named for her), she ducks that label here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a performance art piece and it's not a theater piece," Garretson 
says. "It seems like a play, but it's not. It's all about the songs. I wanted 
to create an atmosphere to set them off -- like a jewel." 
</P>
<P>
The 50-minute score ("all original, with a lot of movie music and '60s themes") 
was recorded at home on husband Marc Wheaton's digital equipment; it features 
everything from bass drum to clarinet, guitar, accordion, viola, trombone, 
marimbas, cello, saxophone and harmonica. There are also between-song sound

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Bedding begonias can give you immediate color in the late summer or fall garden 
and can be counted on for a repeat performance next spring. 
</P>
<P>
When cutting flowers to fill indoor vases, make clean cuts with sharp clippers 
or a knife; these cuts will heal faster than ragged edges. 
</P>
<P>
Take inventory of the garden: Snip off infected leaves, dead flowers and 
awkward shoots; you'll get better, more continuous blooms by keeping faded 
blooms trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
Don't fertilize your lawn just before leaving on vacation. Tender new growth 
could suffer if there's a heat wave while you're gone.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pinus pinea 
</P>
<P>
Italian stone pine 
</P>
<P>
Tall evergreen tree with upswept branches and 5-inch cones 
</P>
<P>
Those Romans knew a good tree when they saw it: They planted stone pines along 
the Appian Way when Rome was still an empire, and although the empire is long 
gone, many of the trees are still there. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Southern California, our Mediterranean climate is just like the 
stone pine's native habitat: hot and dry in the summer, warm and almost dry in 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Stone pines laugh at drought and sneer at rich soil. They will tolerate 
temperatures lower than their sunny heritage would suggest, but no lower than 
10 degrees for more than a couple of nights. This gorgeous tree looks wonderful 
at the beach, along wide boulevards and on an estate large enough to 
accommodate it (it is especially comfortable next to Italian cypress). 
</P>
<P>
But once it grows beyond its plump infancy, it can look dreadful in a small 
yard or anywhere its growth is constricted and its size out of proportion. It 
wants to loom. 
</P>
<P>
The stone pine (also called umbrella pine) has three distinct shapes as it 
grows; when a youth, it's a dense, roundish, cute little thing with blue-green 
needles; as a 6- to 10-foot teen-ager, its trunk extends and thickens, the 
leaves turn green, the top rounds off and the branches curve upward -- a sturdy 
lollipop on a stick. But when it hits its old age, 80-feet-tall prime, the top 
flattens and widens, and it really does resemble an umbrella -- inside-out, but 
an umbrella nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Italian stone pines are the source of pine nuts, those expensive nuggets so 
dear to Italian cuisine. It takes three years for nuts to mature to the edible 
stage; the scales open and fall to the ground before the cones, which remain on 
the branches. 
</P>
<P>
The stone pine's needles are in twos; needle-counting is important with pines 
because it provides a clue to what pests and diseases may afflict the trees. 
The stone pine is relatively pest-free in Southern California but not always 
healthy. Smog can damage and even kill pines, but so far the stone pine seems 
to be breathing easily. 
</P>
<P>
Some spectacular stone pines are lined up by the entrance to the Los Angeles 
State and County Arboretum in Arcadia and all over the UCLA campus in Westwood. 
A few stone pines have been planted as street trees in West Los Angeles, but 
not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro's Point Fermin Park, many venerable stone pines, Moreton Bay figs 
and other trees were destroyed or mutilated when the park was "renovated" two 
years ago. They are mourned. 
</P>
<P>
For the gardener who wants to grow some Italian tradition -- something a little 
more substantial than oregano -- stone pines are an excellent investment, but 
only for large gardens or generous parkways. It's just plain cruel to plant 
this lovely tree in what amounts to an outdoor closet. 
</P>
<P>
Stone pines should be readily available in most Southern California nurseries; 
if they're not actually in stock, they are easily ordered. JUDITH SIMS

CAMPAIGN COSTS APPROACHING THOSE UNDER OLD SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL INCUMBENTS OUTSPEND ELECTION CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four San Diego City Council incumbents seeking reelection this month are 
heavily outspending their major challengers, some by as much as 10 to 1, 
campaign finance reports released Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
Although this year's switch to district-only council races was expected to 
dramatically lower campaign costs, the finance reports also show that the price 
tag in the four contests is approaching $1-million -- comparable to the amounts 
typically spent by this stage in past council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most compelling indicator of the incumbents' daunting fund-raising 
edge is that, of the three who face multiple challengers, two -- Gloria McColl 
and Ed Struiksma -- have raised and spent substantially more than the combined 
total of all of their opponents. Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, meanwhile, has 
spent nearly as much as her two opponents, largely because of personal loans 
totaling $105,000 that she has made to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, the only incumbent who faces a sole primary 
opponent, enjoys the widest financial advantage of all, having outspent her 
challenger, retired San Diego firefighter Ken Key, $97,957.30 to 3,728.88 as of 
Sept. 2, the reports show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Campaign Chest 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma, who faces four challengers in his bid for a third four-year term in 
the 5th District, has amassed the largest campaign treasury of any of the 13 
candidates in this month's primary. As of last week, Struiksma had received 
contributions totaling $243,236.28, or 10 times as much as any of his four 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd District contest, McColl, who, like Struiksma, faces her first 
serious challenge since the early 1980s, also has crossed the $200,000 
threshold, having raised $206,020.49 as of Sept. 2, more than three times 
greater than the combined total of her two opponents. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly two-thirds of the money that she has raised coming from her own 
pocket, Wolfsheimer has spent almost as much as the combined total of her two 
1st District opponents, according to the reports. As of Sept. 2, Wolfsheimer 
had spent $149,936.92, and her opponents, former county supervisorial aide Bob 
Trettin and retired Navy Capt. Harry Mathis, had spent $108,551.70 and 
$54,219.11, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the council candidates had raised or loaned themselves contributions 
totaling $1,024,208.80 and, as of Sept. 2, had spent $873,029.46, the reports 
show. Those totals are comparable -- in some districts, slightly higher -- than 
the amounts typically spent in past council primaries. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of an appreciable drop in campaign costs to date is not surprising 
in one respect, given that Proposition E, the district-only proposition 
narrowly approved by San Diego voters last November, did not structurally alter 
the nature of council primaries. As a result, the candidates' spending patterns 
this year have not differed markedly from those in past primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's former two-tiered election system, council primaries were 
confined to individual districts, followed by citywide runoffs between the top 
two vote-getters. This year, the council primaries remain district contests, 
although candidates now can win election outright by receiving more than 50% of 
the primary vote. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives a majority vote, the top two finishers will compete in 
a district runoff. Should runoffs be necessary -- and they are expected in at 
least two of the four races -- the impact, financial and otherwise, of the 
change to district-only elections is expected to become clearer. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the incumbents' six-figure campaign treasuries reflect as much the 
strong opposition that they face as they do the incumbents' efforts to wrap up 
the election in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1st District, Wolfsheimer, who is running for a second term, has been 
forced to rely on her own money to keep pace with her two challengers. 
Including the $105,000 that she donated to her own campaign, she has raised 
$166,858. Trettin has received contributions totaling $109,436.50, and Mathis, 
who spent $16,100 of his own money, has raised $66,420.40. 
</P>
<P>
McColl, who is running for the third time to retain the 3rd District seat to 
which she was appointed in 1983, had spent $180,400.85 as of Sept. 2, the 
reports show. Her major opponent, real estate broker John Hartley, had spent 
only $43,734.37 during the same period, including $1,000 in personal money, and 
businessman Charles Ulmschneider spent $5,975.79 in his long-shot campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma's $192,262.54 spending total dwarfs the amounts spent by his four 
opponents in the 5th District, being nearly six times as much as their 
cumulative total. Among the challengers, former San Diego City Councilman Floyd 
Morrow had spent $21,868, including $14,000 of his own money; former 
Wolfsheimer aide Linda Bernhardt had spent $11,989, and lawyer Mike Eckmann had 
spent $2,405 ($20 less than he has loaned his campaign). Marketing consultant 
Bob Switzer did not file a report, indicating that he intends to spend less 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the 7th District race, McCarty, a prohibitive favorite in her bid for a 
second term, has raised $118,965.18, contrasted with only $5,716 for Key.

COURT APPOINTS RECEIVER FOR TROUBLED HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pate on Friday named a receiver to supervise the 
transfer of financially troubled Greater San Diego Health Plan's subscribers to 
a health-care company operated by several San Diego hospitals and two large 
health-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
Pate took the action because the state Department of Corporations determined 
that the health plan "has recorded significantly escalating operating losses," 
Asst. Commissioner Alice W. Suitt said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The health plan is a wholly owned subsidiary of San Diego-based Western Health 
Plans, a publicly traded company that lost $20 million during the three years 
that ended June 30. Regulators asked for a receiver to be appointed because 
they feared that more losses might hinder the health plan's ability to fulfill 
contracts for patient care. 
</P>
<P>
A receivership was the best way to "adequately protect the interests" of the 
health plan's subscribers, Suitt said Friday. "This is the most expeditious 
route open to us, it was the most timely route, and it offers the most 
protection for the enrollees." 
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the Pace Group, a consulting firm, to complete the transfer 
of the San Diego health plan's subscribers to the consortium that includes 
Children's Hospital and Health Center, Community Hospital of Chula Vista, 
Grossmont Hospital, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Palomar Medical Center, 
Pomerado Hospital, Scripps Memorial (Chula Vista), Scripps Memorial (La Jolla), 
Scripps Memorial (Encinitas), Sharp Cabrillo Hospital, Sharp Memorial Hospital 
and Tri-City Hospital District. 
</P>
<P>
That consortium also includes Choice, a health plan operated by Partners 
National Health Plans, Aetna Healthcare Programs of California and VHA 
Enterprises, a subsidiary of Voluntary Hospitals of America. 
</P>
<P>
Western in July announced an agreement in principal to sell the San Diego 
health plan, which at the time included 125,000 members, to the consortium that 
includes the local hospitals, Aetna and Partners. However, Western failed to 
complete the sale by an Aug. 18 deadline, and state regulators have been 
"actively working" to solve Western's cash problems, Suitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Appointing a receiver "is not a strategy we use a lot," Suitt said. "It's a 
kind of a last resort strategy." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Western's financial problems caused some private- and 
public-sector employers to not renew contracts with the San Diego plan. Maxwell 
Laboratories earlier this month told its employees that it would not renew a 
contract with Greater San Diego Health Plan, largely because of its financial 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Cohegan, a spokeswoman for the San Diego hospital consortium, declined 
Friday to comment on the court action. The hospitals believe that the Choice 
health-care program represents "the best choice" for Greater San Diego's 
subscribers and health-care providers, Cohegan said. 
</P>
<P>
Western, in a press release issued late Friday afternoon, said that, if the 
transfer takes place, San Diego health plan members who "do not choose 
otherwise will become subscribers of Choice." 
</P>
<P>
According to terms of the proposed agreement that the receiver will try to 
complete, Choice would pay the Greater San Diego Health Plan $50 for each 
subscriber who remains with Choice on Jan. 15, 1990. Choice would pay the 
health plan a minimum of $1.5 million, according to thepress release.

FIREMAN LOSES BID TO REGAIN JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego fire captain, who was dismissed because of charges that his home 
was a methamphetamine laboratory and that he drove a city vehicle under the 
influence of alcohol and drugs, lost his attempt Friday to win his job back. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a second decision Friday involving firefighters and illegal drugs, 
the San Diego Civil Service Commission reversed a suspension handed another 
firefighter in connection with his 1986 arrest on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Joseph Rivas, 32, of San Diego, whose appeal was successful, had 
maintained that he had been unfairly lumped in with others caught up in a 
four-month police probe last year of drug use in the Fire Department. That 
probe originally was sparked by a tip police received about the captain who 
lost his appeal, Ronald R. Cervantes, 33, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes' termination was "reasonable, fully justified and warranted," the 
commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs found by police officers in an undercover raid June 12, 1988 at 
Cervantes' home belonged to him, the commission found. Police told reporters 
they found "some quantity" of drugs at the house and indications of a meth lab. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also found that Cervantes, an 11-year department veteran who 
last served in a community education post, drove his city-supplied car June 5, 
1988 after drinking alcohol and while under the influence of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes denied all accusations against him at a department fact-finding 
hearing last Sept. 27. However, he was discharged Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's hearings on Cervantes' appeal lasted four days this July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conduct Called Inexcusable 
</P>
<P>
Though Cervantes had an excellent service record, his conduct and "continued 
denial" of the charges was "inexcusable, intolerable and had the potential to 
jeopardize the safety" of the public and other firefighters, the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I don't expect Mr. Cervantes will be pleased with the decision," 
said Joel Klevens, Cervantes' attorney. "I wouldn't be if I were in his shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes could not be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said there was not enough evidence to support an additional 
charge that Cervantes sold a dollar bill laced with methamphetamine to an 
undercover police informer. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes was one of four firefighters indicted on federal drug charges last 
October, capping an investigation by the Police Department in which 
firefighters allegedly furnished illegal drugs to undercover police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Those federal criminal charges against Cervantes were deferred March 3 for a 
year, the commission said. If he has no criminal violations during that time, 
the charges will be dismissed, it said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney Criticizes Commission 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision in the Rivas case followed what his lawyer, Thomas 
Waddell, called "the lamest attempt to prosecute a guy I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials contended at a hearing June 29 that Rivas was 
arrested in February, 1986 while snorting cocaine in a restroom at the Sports 
Arena. He was off duty and at a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
Waddell pointed out at the hearing that the arrest was old, that the case had 
never been prosecuted and that senior officers in the Fire Department suspended 
Rivas last November only after they later learned he allegedly asked the police 
officer to let him go because he was a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
After Rivas was suspended for 10 shifts without pay -- firefighters work 
24-hour shifts -- he appealed to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed with findings by hearing officer Stanley E. Willis II 
that disciplinary action against Rivas would have been warranted only in 1986, 
not now. To try to suspend him now was "not reasonable nor appropriate," Willis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tossing out his suspension, the commission agreed with Willis' 
conclusion that Rivas deserves back pay. However, it ordered Rivas to submit to 
random drug tests through December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Case Still Pending 
</P>
<P>
The Cervantes and Rivas cases were two of four recently appealed to the 
commission involving firefighters protesting department action. Still pending 
is the discipline case involving George V. Jessup, a fire captain. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the commission reinstated seven-year firefighter Vincent Stevenson, 
who had appealed his termination, finding that the Fire Department's system for 
dealing with employees who abuse drugs was "inequitable." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson admitted smoking cocaine while off duty last year, but his attorney, 
Klevens, argued that other recent cases of firefighters abusing drugs for long 
periods did not result in dismissals.

'LEADERSHIP STYLE, PHILOSOPHY' CITED;

<P>
BOARD FIRES CHULA VISTA SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Chula Vista City School District has been fired by 
the school board in a surprise move only two days before the traditional school 
year begins, and only a year after he was hired to bring wide-ranging changes 
to the South Bay district. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. McCarthy, selected in June, 1988, after a nationwide search, had been 
praised as late as April for "having a background and philosophy similar to 
that of the district." But, on Friday, board President Frank Tarantino said the 
board acted Thursday night "because of differences in leadership style and 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
The rapidly growing district has almost 17,000 students in kindergarten through 
sixth grade, spread through 33 elementary schools, with about a third on 
year-round schedules. It is the largest elementary school district in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Tarantino, a high school counselor with the Sweetwater high school district, 
refused Friday to elaborate on the board's brief statement about McCarthy's 
forced resignation, under which he will be paid through June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shocked, Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said he was "genuinely shocked and disappointed" at the action, 
although he conceded that, in retrospect, his many initiatives during the past 
year had generated substantial opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actions, McCarthy had hired several new administrators, revamped 
the bilingual program and instituted teacher accountability measures to boost 
student achievement. The district's scores on the California Assessment Program 
standardized tests ranked among the county's lowest in reading and mathematics 
during the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the teachers union was not enamored with what I was 
trying to do, which is to gear efforts to helping kids learn rather than 
keeping everyone happy," McCarthy said. "There is no doubt that the quality of 
the teaching staff in Chula Vista is there to achieve the same results as 
National City and South Bay Union (districts) have done. . . . I knew there 
were some difficulties," but nothing to suggest his firing, he added. A 
district teacher who asked not to be identified said that McCarthy "had hurt a 
lot of people" with his aggressive style and that there was "a general 
undercurrent of unrest, from the top to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said that, after McCarthy would finish a school visit, the staff 
would be upset at the way he had talked to them when outlining necessary 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, who came to Chula Vista after seven years as superintendent in San 
Leandro, near San Francisco, said he will look for another school position. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the much-needed change in Chula Vista will take place . . . and 
that, with some of the things now put in place, the district will begin to turn 
the corner," McCarthy said.

2 HELD AFTER CHASE IN ROBBERY OF S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two men arrested Friday after an armed robbery at the Home Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan office at 6902 Navajo Road might be linked to a series of 
recent bank robberies, San Diego police said . 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Bradley T. Hendon, 29, and Wayne K. Dyer, 30, after two men 
took $1,486 from the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that Hendon has been involved in a series of robberies," a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendon and Dyer were arrested shortly before 5 p.m. after a brief chase. A 
search of their vehicle turned up an air gun resembling a .45-caliber pistol, 
as well as the missing cash. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center.

having obtained a warrant to search the man's car and bus, which were impounded 
after his arrest, on Friday found three homemade bombs, about 30 handguns and 
rifles, and 1,000 rounds of ammunition and bomb-making materials, said Santa 
Ana Police Sgt. Rich Murg. The bombs were safely defused, said Murg, adding 
that the man, Richard Dean Woodley, 35, will now face weapons charges in 
addition to his assault charge. Murg said investigators have not determined how 
the explosives were to be used. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were "numerous differences" between J. David &amp; Co. records and 
documents obtained from the brokerage house, said an Internal Revenue Service 
agent who testified Friday in the fraud and tax evasion trial of Nancy Hoover 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Paul T. Perry, who compared the company's financial statements with documents 
seized after the collapse of J. David, said that actual trades were omitted, 
changed or added to records being maintained at the La Jolla investment house. 
</P>
<P>
Records that showed huge profits being made by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli were 
used by J. David salespeople to encourage people to become investors. Previous 
testimony in the trial indicated that Hunter provided information that led to 
the creation of the so-called performance records. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts related to the giant Ponzi scheme at J. 
David, which defrauded about 1,200 people out of nearly $90 million when the 
well-known firm was forced into bankruptcy in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that he analyzed a number of accounts overseen by Dominelli, and 
that most of them lost money over the course of a year, even though other 
records shown investors indicated the trading led to a substantial profit. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said an interbank account, which started with a $30,000 value and dealt 
with foreign currency, was reported to have made $28,024 over the year. 
However, his audit showed that the account actually lost more than $28,000, a 
difference of more than $56,000, Perry testified. 
</P>
<P>
This 1980 performance record omitted six losses, showed six losses as profits 
and contained trades that were actually made in another account, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry's testimony will continue when the trial resumes Tuesday in federal 
court.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 47-year-old woman who tried to give her daughter a homemade abortion by using 
a household disinfectant was ordered Friday to perform 180 hours of volunteer 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Ida Franks of Oceanside was placed on five years' probation for involuntary 
manslaughter in the death of one of her daughter's twin babies, which were born 
Dec. 30, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
No jail time was given Franks, who could have been sentenced to a year in the 
plea-bargain agreement. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner commented that he found the facts 
of the case "appalling." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner fined Franks $500 and ordered her to participate in an Alcoholics 
Anonymous program after she relocates to Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Franks' daughter, Vickie Judkins, 24, also of Oceanside, testified against her 
mother at a preliminary hearing April 24 that Franks inserted a Lysol-soaked 
straw into her vagina several days before she gave birth to the twins. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins said one baby was born dead, the other alive. She said she went to the 
bathroom after the births, then discovered that the second baby was also dead 
and that her mother was wrapping the bodies in newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins pleaded guilty to child endangerment March 21. She also was placed on 
five years' probation June 1 and ordered to perform 160 hours of work in an 
Oceanside soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the babies, which the women said they left in trash bins on 
Interstate 5, were never found. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins' husband, Willie Judkins, was a Marine at Camp Pendleton at the time. 
He was not charged.

RESIDENTS PLAN 2ND LOOK AT RAIL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley homeowner leaders, most of whom have opposed all of the 
mass transit proposals for the Valley, have decided to take a second look at 
the question of whether to build a local rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 17 homeowner organizations are to meet today for what was termed a 
"fact-finding session on rail" by Richard H. Close, president of the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to address the leaders are rail planners from the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which is studying two possible cross-Valley rail 
routes, both of which would terminate at Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The routes are the south shoulder of the Ventura Freeway and Southern Pacific 
railroad's Burbank branch, a little-used freight right of way that crosses the 
Valley parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Both would connect to the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- the 
freeway route at Universal City and the Chandler-Victory line in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Study 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building a countywide rail network, is scheduled to 
release a preliminary study of the two routes in October. In March, it plans to 
choose a route and determine if the line should be a Metro Rail extension or a 
light-rail trolley, which probably would be built at ground-level. 
</P>
<P>
Also invited to today's session, which is closed to the public, are state Sen. 
Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, 
co-authors of a plan to extend Metro Rail partly underground from North 
Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. In the basin, passengers would transfer to 
buses to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has incorporated the plan into a bill that has picked up bipartisan 
support among Valley representatives in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would prohibit the county Transportation Commission from building any 
line in the Valley that is not at least partly underground in residential 
areas, thereby meeting one of the chief complaints of homeowner leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Although the legislation would not force the commission to build a Valley line, 
commissioners have conceded that the Valley is the next likely candidate for 
such a line. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' bill has been approved by two Assembly committees and is expected to 
be voted on in the full Assembly and Senate next week. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Burns, Robbins' legislative aide in Sacramento, said Friday that she is 
optimistic that the bill will be approved by both chambers "but the governor is 
anybody's guess." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a Robbins bill that the Tarzana 
Democrat said would have given the Valley control over design of a line. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Robbins-Braude plan has drawn widespread support, most homeowner 
leaders have remained uncommitted. Close said he and fellow leaders "still want 
to have answers about where stations would be built, where passengers would 
park and whether stations will be magnets for intense development."

PIERCE OFFICIALS DENY INFERTILE SOIL DUMPED AT FARM ILLEGALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of San Fernando Valley conservationists and animal lovers complained 
Friday that infertile soil laden with refuse and debris is being dumped on 
pastures at the Pierce College Farm, and accused college officials of approving 
the dumping. 
</P>
<P>
College officials denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Kemsley, president of the Friends of Pierce College Farm, said the 
dumping of concrete, subsoil and trash has been going on since 1987. Some of 
the dumping has been illegal, she said, adding that she saw a steady stream of 
trucks dump subsoil -- thickly compacted soil in which plants have difficulty 
taking root -- and refuse on the site Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to stop this," said Kemsley, who said she has been coming to 
the Woodland Hills farm for years to ride horses. 
</P>
<P>
Kemsley's daughter, Kim, said developers were being allowed and even encouraged 
by school authorities to bring in subsoil from excavation sites. "What they're 
doing is really detrimental to the whole agricultural program there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
College President David Means denied charges that the school allowed illegal 
dumping or deposits of inadequate soil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Incident Legal 
</P>
<P>
"There have been instances where people have sneaked onto the property and 
dumped things, but this latest incident they're talking about was not illegal," 
Means said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an excavation being done at that time, and the manager of the farm 
gave the developer permission to dump dirt on the low level of the pasture 
where floods have hit" to raise the ground level and prevent future flooding, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said other developers have been given permission in the past to dump topsoil 
on the farmland. "But we just don't accept any dirt that's bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Martha S. Witter, a consultant with the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource 
Conservation District, said soil recently dumped on the farm's pastures 
contained a large amount of debris such as concrete and steel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a lower quality than what was there before," Witter said. "The 
soil is not worth much."

ANGELS GET MESSAGE, HOLD OFF RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Angels free-falling through another September, having lost seven of 
their last eight games in decidedly uninspired fashion, Manager Doug Rader 
decided to take matters into his own hands Friday evening and grabbed a bat. 
</P>
<P>
With it, Rader conducted a team meeting on the outfield grass at Anaheim 
Stadium, brandishing the bat every now and then to make sure certain points got 
across. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically like the other meetings Doug has had this year," pitcher 
Chuck Finley said. "Only he was a little bit more into this one." 
</P>
<P>
As for the game that followed, well, the Angels were a little bit more into 
this one, too. Two big hits by Claudell Washington, six strong innings by Bert 
Blyleven and some pressurized relief pitching by Bryan Harvey gave the Angels a 
2-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox before a crowd of 32,408. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Angels were able to gain ground in the American League West 
standings for the first time since Aug. 31. With Oakland's 5-1 loss to the New 
York Yankees, the third-place Angels now trail the first-place Athletics by 
five games and the second-place Kansas City Royals by 1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Friday's events had been foreshadowed. Washington was hitting .351 with 
two home runs and five RBIs against Boston this season -- a trend he continued 
in his first two at-bats against Red Sox starter Mike Boddicker (12-10). 
</P>
<P>
Washington doubled and scored the Angels' first run in the first inning, coming 
home on a single by Chili Davis. And in the third inning, Washington delivered 
the game's decisive blow, a bases-empty home run into the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
Those two hits comprised exactly half of the Angel offense -- Davis and Johnny 
Ray had the other two hits -- but for once, the Angels were able to do a lot 
with a little. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven ended a personal two-game losing streak and became a 15-game winner 
for the 10th time in his career by shutting out the Red Sox for five innings 
and limiting them to one run on five hits through six. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Blyleven (15-4) turned proceedings over to the Angel bullpen, Greg Minton 
followed by Harvey. Minton worked a perfect seventh inning, and Harvey replaced 
him with one out and a runner on base in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey closed out that threat but found himself facing another when his 
shortstop, Kent Anderson, and his left fielder, Max Venable, opened the top of 
the ninth by colliding on a pop fly by Danny Heep. Backpedaling on the ball, 
Anderson was blind-sided by Venable, and the impact jarred the baseball free 
from Anderson's grasp for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Luis Rivera, pinch-running for Heep, was on second base, 
following Sam Horn's pinch-single. And at the plate was Wade Boggs, the 
American League's second-leading hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey worked the count to 1 and 2 and then crossed up Boggs on a check swing, 
sending the ball dribbling in front of the mound. It was as harmless a swing as 
Boggs takes, and Harvey pounced upon the ball. 
</P>
<P>
His throw to first base wasn't great, skipping in the dirt, but Wally Joyner 
made the scoop, and the Angels finally had September victory No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to have someone catch that last one," Rader said with a sigh, "I'm 
glad it was Wally." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's catch enabled the Angels to win for only the sixth time in their last 
19 games. It also enabled Harvey to become the Angels' first reliever to save 
20 games in a season since Donnie Moore saved 21 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The team's course has yet to be completely corrected, but for one evening, the 
Angels' actions counted as loudly as Rader's words. 
</P>
<P>
Rader's address, in the view of more than one witness, was a formidable call to 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
The theme, punctuated by polished ash, was: Don't ruin five good months with 
one last, lousy one. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug wanted us to think about how we've played most of the year and then how 
we've addressed the games the last few days," Finley said. "He said the overall 
play of the team hasn't been good, and 'It's up to you guys to kick yourselves 
in the butt. Don't let everything we've worked for go down the drain because of 
one bad road trip. Keep hustling.' " 
</P>
<P>
Finley said Rader then opened the meeting up for player comment. 
</P>
<P>
There were none. 
</P>
<P>
"When Doug has the floor," Finley said with a smile, "he has the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of life were subsequently spotted in the Angel outfield -- Tony Armas and 
Venable both made fine running catches -- but nothing helps a slumping team as 
much as nine innings of one-run pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven had a no-hitter through 4 2/3 innings, retiring 14 of the first 15 he 
faced. The only blemish was a first-inning walk to Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
He started to waver in the fifth and sixth innings, leaving the bases loaded in 
the fifth before yielding three hits, a walk and a run in the sixth. Heep's 
two-out single accounted for the run, scoring Mike Greenwell from second base. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a battle for Bert because his breaking pitch was inconsistent," 
Rader said. "But he perservered and made something out of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
And that, with a twist, remains the Angels' objective the rest of the way. Why 
let another September slip away and make nothing out of something? 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Every game he sits out -- Friday was his third straight -- Angel catcher Lance 
Parrish is reminded of Glenn Braggs, the Milwaukee Brewers outfielder who 
plowed into Parrish at the plate on Aug. 5. Parrish limped away with two 
separated ribs and a bruised left knee that continues to hurt. Fearing a 
cartilage tear, the Angels had Parrish's knee X-rayed Thursday and a bone 
bruise was revealed. Parrish received a cortisone injection that could sideline 
him through the remainder of this series.

MORNING BRIEFING: DURING THE RITES OF AUTUMN, PERSPECTIVE FOUND ON SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The football season is upon us -- tailgate parties, the two-minute warning, the 
color and smell of autumn and the annual jests from those colorful coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Some of their previous observations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Mack Brown, after Tulane had lost its first seven games: "I called up 
Dial-a-Prayer and they hung up on me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Bowden, after watching Miami blast his top-ranked Florida State 
Seminoles, 31-0, last season in what had been billed as the college game of the 
century: "It was a classic until we kicked off." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Sewalt, Texas Christian recruiting coordinator, about his team: "We've 
got so many kids on our roster (70 sophomores and freshmen) we're going to be 
the first football team in history with an equipment order for Pampers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Callahan, Missouri sports information director, on how he improved at 
his job: "I used to have the worst time remembering names. Then I took the Sam 
Carnegie course and I've been all right ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Darrell Royal, former Texas coach, philosophizing: "A head coach is guided 
by one primary objective -- to dig, claw, wheedle, coax that fanatical effort 
out of his players. He wants his team to play on Saturday as if they were 
planting the flag on Iwo Jima." 
</P>
<P>
Add football quotes: Linebacker Billy Ray Smith of the San Diego Chargers, 
after looking at some of the replacement players during the strike of a few 
seasons back: "Put it this way. If Richard Burton got sick the night before 
playing Macbeth in New York, he wouldn't be worried if Pee-Wee Herman replaced 
him for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Gardi, New York Jets defensive coach, when it was mentioned that 
setting up defenses against the high-scoring Chargers was like playing a chess 
game: "I hope not; I'm a pinochle man." 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Unitas, Baltimore's great quarterback, commenting on his days with the 
Bloomington Rams, a semipro team: "We didn't have a team bus. We had a team 
bike." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alex Karras on playing for George Allen: "He was great to the old guys. He 
had one trainer just to treat varicose veins." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Byrd, rookie lineman for the Houston Oilers, explaining why he 
joined a group of players who shaved their heads as a sign of solidarity: "I 
guess it was voluntary. There were 10 guys around me, so I volunteered." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jay Randolph, NBC play-by-play announcer, on the rapid progress of Miami 
Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino: "He didn't develop, he was instant print." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beano Cook, sports commentator: "The two most important jobs in America are 
held by foreigners -- room service and field-goal kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Smerlas of Buffalo, about a former Bill, Conrad Dobler, who returned 
to Buffalo for a charity roast: "It's a wonderful sight, isn't it? Conrad 
eating with a knife and fork." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do major league pitchers Orel Hershiser and Roger McDowell 
have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Stand and deliver: According to the book, "The College Names of Games," this is 
the origin of one of baseball's most-loved traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Late in an 1882 exhibition game between Manhattan College and the New York 
Metropolitans, the students were growing restless and unruly during the long 
game. Brother Jasper, Manhattan's head of resident students, ventured into the 
stands to calm the students. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing that they were tired of sitting in the cramped bleachers, Jasper called 
on them to stand and stretch to relieve their tension. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Thus was born the seventh-inning stretch. Or so the book says. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Both played college baseball at Bowling Green State University. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Frank Broyles, Arkansas athletic director, on whether he'd still 
like his football coach, Ken Hatfield, if the team won only half its games: 
"Sure I would. I'd miss him, too."

HERSHISER HAS A DIFFERENT SCORELESS STREAK; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS GIVE THEIR PITCHER ZERO SUPPORT AGAIN AS PADRES WIN IT, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers, visiting their southern neighbors Friday night for the first time 
since late July, had their first chance to see what this San Diego Padres' 
pennant fuss was all about. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them may still have their hands over their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1-0 loss, the Dodgers discovered at least three of the ways the Padres 
have crept within six games of the first-place San Francisco Giants: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a 22-year-old pitcher who last season was in the Midwestern Collegiate 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a former starter who quietly set the Padre record Friday by earning 
his major league-leading 38th save. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a game-winning double off a shortstop's knees. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the seventh inning of a scoreless game, Dodger starter Orel 
Hershiser walked Bip Roberts, who stole second base on a pitch that bounced 
under catcher Mike Scioscia's glove. Roberto Alomar was intentionally walked, 
bringing up Darrin Jackson, who entered the game in the fourth inning in place 
of sore-heeled Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next, even Gwynn couldn't have pulled off. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson lofted a ball in front of shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who retreated in 
anticipation of the bounce. But the bounce went crazy, shooting off the infield 
dirt and ricocheting off his knees into shallow left field. Roberts scored, and 
Jackson got his sixth, and oddest, double of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lucky, what can you say?" said Jackson, who had struck out in his 
previous two at-bats against Hershiser. "As soon as I hit it, I said, 'Shoot, 
it's right at him.' But it was a knuckleball. And it landed in a perfect spot." 
</P>
<P>
Said Griffin: "I think I should have caught the ball. At least, I should have 
blocked the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium crowd of 28,771 didn't know whether to cheer 
or laugh, so they did both. They kept it up for the remaining two innings as 
rookie Andy Benes gave up two hits in 7 1/3 innings for his fourth consecutive 
victory. Mark Davis threw the final 1 2/3 innings for his save. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' 15th victory in their last 18 games was enough to keep them in a 
second-place tie with the Houston Astros, who beat the National League 
West-leading Giants, 5-2. And it was more than enough to help Hershiser reach a 
milestone of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
He lost his third consecutive game and has an 0-4 record in his last six 
starts, despite an earned-run average of 1.93 during that time. This is because 
the Dodgers have been shut out in his last three starts, and have not scored in 
his last 30 innings. 
</P>
<P>
How bad has Hershiser's luck been? Bad enough, he implied, that it may have 
cost him a second consecutive Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm pitching better than last year," said Hershiser, who is 14-12 with 
a 2.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he had a 2.26 ERA but was 23-8. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be more frustrating if we were in a pennant race . . . if these games 
meant anything," Hershiser said. "All I can do is go out and do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Dodgers were shut out for a major league-leading 16h time, 
Hershiser's performance -- he gave up seven hits in seven innings -- was 
overshadowed by those of Benes and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis got the record after he replaced Benes in the eighth inning with Lenny 
Harris on second base and one out. Davis struck out both Willie Randolph and 
Eddie Murray, then retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth. He has had six 
saves in the Padres' last seven games and has blown only four of his 42 save 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to reflect on the season and any numbers until the end of the year, 
but this (record) is definitely a highlight for me and my career," said Davis, 
who passed Rollie Fingers' record of 37 saves set in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Benes, last year's National League No. 1 draft pick from the University of 
Evansville, was celebrating the passing of a different landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I grew up tonight," said Benes, who struck out six in improving to 
4-2. "It made me feel like I'm finally over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' offense, getting their first look at Benes, learned what 
Philadelphia and Montreal had already discovered. Benes can throw well -- and 
hard. He entered with only five previous major league starts but with victories 
in his last three -- over the Expos and the Phillies twice. During those 
starts, he had struck out 18 in 19 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Benes struck out at least one batter in each inning until the sixth, which 
featured his most important pitch. And it wasn't a strike. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, he walked Randolph, then watched as Murray drove a fastball into 
the left-field corner for a double, moving Randolph to third base. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Mike Marshall, who if he thought the kid was cracking, soon realized 
otherwise. Benes' first pitch hummed underneath Marshall's chin, dropping him 
to the ground while the roaring crowd jumped to its feet. Four pitches later, 
Marshall fouled weakly to the first baseman. Jeff Hamilton hit a grounder up 
the middle that shortstop Garry Templeton picked off in front of second base 
and threw to first to end the inning and the final Dodger threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other start, I've had an inning where I've given up more than one run -- 
this was the big inning for me," Benes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser hasn't seen a big inning since Eddie Murray hit a two-run homer for 
him in the sixth inning of an Aug. 18 game in New York. The Dodgers have not 
scored for him since then. That was 21 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers could finish with two pitchers among the league's top five in ERA 
-- Orel Hershiser and Mike Morgan. But Morgan needs 162 innings to qualify and 
has only 148 2/3. With 21 games remaining, it will be difficult for Morgan 
because he is no longer a starter. "It would be nice to go home for the winter 
having that ranking under my belt," said Morgan, whose 2.60 ERA ranks fifth. 
"It wasn't my main objective when we started the season, but here it is 
September, and it's become a little more important." Morgan said he would need 
eight or nine more appearances to accumulate the 12 1/3 needed innings. 
</P>
<P>
Look for several more players from triple-A Albuquerque to join the Dodgers 
after the weekend. The Dukes could finish their Pacific Coast League 
championship series against Vancouver by Sunday. Among the favorites for recall 
are pitcher Jeff Fischer, third baseman Dave Hansen and shortstop Jose 
Vizcaino. . . . Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said Friday he has discussed 
the possibility of catcher Rick Dempsey remaining with the organization as a 
minor league coach or manager after his playing career ends. "I think he would 
be a tremendous asset in that area," said Claire, who must first decide whether 
to offer another playing contract to Dempsey, whose contract expires at the end 
of this season. Claire and free-agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela won't begin 
negotiations until after the season, as Valenzuela's agent, Tony DeMarco, said 
last month.

TIME RUNNING OUT ON LEGEND AT CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were twin stars in the football universe, present at the birth of their 
respective worlds, bright lights blazing across the sky for two decades and 
now, ironically, also fading in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shoup and Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
Each man was the only coach his team had ever known. Each rose to his zenith in 
the winter of 1971 with a championship. Each stumbled through the late '80s, 
and each plummeted to his nadir in the summer of '89. 
</P>
<P>
Landry was absent this summer from the California Lutheran University campus, 
site of the Dallas Cowboy training camp. He was home in Texas, having been 
fired by new Cowboy owner Jerry Jones several months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
And Shoup was in his CLU office, a bunker against the onslaught of his own 
administration, which announced last month that Shoup won't be back as head 
coach of the Kingsmen after this season, his 27th. 
</P>
<P>
What could be Shoup's last season begins today when CLU visits Sonoma State at 
1 p.m. Both the coach and the administration agreed that Shoup would coach this 
season, then take a sabbatical. Shoup had said he would then reassess the 
situation and decide if he wanted to return. CLU officials said that the 
decision had been made. He wouldn't return. 
</P>
<P>
"The university has now accepted my premise that there are real questions about 
my contract that have yet to be resolved, " said Shoup, who has hired an 
attorney and has threatened CLU with legal action. "We are going to take our 
time to work things out, think things through. This is a solvable issue. There 
was just a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"My tenure status is not what it would be for a normal coach. You don't 
normally have tenure as a coach. My point is that I have a legal right to 
return (after a sabbatical). Their point is that it will be awkward to have an 
interim coach. I understand that. I just didn't like the way things were 
handled. 
</P>
<P>
"But a year from now, who knows what changes there will have been in people and 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
School officials have refused to comment on the situation, but it was a change 
in programs that started the problems. 
</P>
<P>
After compiling one of the best won-lost records in college football (182-81-6) 
in his 26-year reign, after 13 NAIA District 3 titles, after three trips to the 
national championship game and the triumph there in '71, Shoup saw his world 
start to crumble last fall. The program Shoup once labeled "the Notre Dame of 
the West" had decided to lower its expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the CLU football team, amid much hoopla, moved up to Division 
II of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and joined the Western Football 
Conference. After years of beating up on the likes of Azusa Pacific and 
Whittier, CLU was taking a step up to play with the bigger boys. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the big boys were a little too big. In the ensuing four 
seasons, Cal Lutheran's record was 16-27; in conference play, a disastrous 
2-19. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup wanted to fight rather than switch. CLU officials took the opposite 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the school voted to drop out of the WFC and down to Division III 
to join the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
To some, it seemed like the death knell for one of Southern California's most 
competitive small-college programs. In the SCIAC, athletic scholarships are 
prohibited. So is spring football. And off-campus recruiting is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup openly opposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
It got ugly. At one point, Shoup accused his own administration of suppressing 
an independent report commissioned by the school and written by the athletic 
director of Pacific Lutheran, an NAIA Division II school in Tacoma, Wash., that 
advised against the move. Administration officials denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel disappointed for past, present and future football players," Shoup said 
at the time. "Unfortunately, I feel like prejudice triumphed over 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The CLU administration triumphed over Shoup. 
</P>
<P>
It never would have happened in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
It sometimes seems that Bob Shoup's whole life has been a two-minute drill. But 
through the years, every time he's been bogged down, about to be sacked, time 
and opportunity running out, he has found a path. 
</P>
<P>
 Flashback to the 1940s: Shoup is attending Marshall Fundamental junior high in 
Pasadena. Marshall has a football program and Shoup wants to be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
But he's too small. The minimum weight to make the team is 120 pounds. Shoup 
weighs 118 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
But he finds two padlocks, sews them to the inside of his trunks and, wearing a 
grin, proudly steps on the scales. 
</P>
<P>
He makes the team. 
</P>
<P>
Flashback to the 1950s: Shoup's father, Donald, is a coach at schools in Crete, 
Neb., and later in Pasadena. But Bob toys with several other career ideas -- 
doctor, life-insurance salesman, businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Bob Shoup becomes exposed to coaching the way many do, by taking the 
reins of a team of youngsters. After a season of youth softball, he scratches 
his head and exclaims, "You mean people get paid for this!" 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he, too, is getting paid. In 1956, he starts his coaching career at North 
Torrance High and goes on to win league championships in everything from 
basketball to tennis to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 His course in life is set. 
</P>
<P>
Flashback to the 1960s: Shoup becomes the first football coach at California 
Lutheran College in Thousand Oaks, a new, struggling institution. 
</P>
<P>
The team has few players, no equipment, no field, no place to practice and, 
everybody figures, no chance. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it had someplace to go, it has no way to get there. 
</P>
<P>
The squad temporarily practices in an orange grove. Shoup secures 
transportation at a war surplus store -- an old U. S. Navy bus -- and the 
football team has its wheels. 
</P>
<P>
By season's end, this ragtag crew, just 33 strong, has actually achieved a 
modicum of respectability. Shoup's pseudo junior varsity finishes 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Flashback to the 1970s: Lean times have hit CLC. The Lutheran Church, owner and 
operator of the school, has decided to shut it down because it is a chronic 
money loser. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, though, it has become a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup's coaching career reaches its pinnacle late in 1971 when the Kingsmen 
beat Westminster College of Pennsylvania in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics Division II title game. 
</P>
<P>
The waves of euphoria rising from Mount Clef Stadium smash the plans to shut 
CLC's doors. The school is saved. 
</P>
<P>
"That," according to Shoup, "was the turning point." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, despite all his triumphs, Shoup clings steadfastly to his roots. 
</P>
<P>
"The most successful teams are easy to relate to," he said, "but I think one of 
the greatest coaching jobs I ever did was 1962 when we started." 
</P>
<P>
The stories from that year seem endless. On one trip to Claremont College, the 
Navy bus broke down. A call for help went out. Claremont wound up sending its 
players to pick up the stranded CLC team. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Shoup's team posted a winning record, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 1964 and the ladies' blue slippers, perhaps the most celebrated pair 
of slippers since Dorothy slipped hers on in the Land of Oz. 
</P>
<P>
"We found them in a motel in Colorado Springs," Shoup said. "The manager threw 
them in the team bag. I guess he thought they belonged to one of the players. 
We started taking them wherever we went. We've won 90% of our games when we've 
had those slippers with us." 
</P>
<P>
Players would rub and kiss them as part of their pregame ritual -- and the team 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
And win and win. 
</P>
<P>
After going unbeaten (8-0-2) in the championship year of '71, the Kingsmen had 
a couple of mediocre years, then, in 1974, became a national small-college 
powerhouse for nearly a decade. From '74 through '82, CLC was 76-15-2, with two 
more appearances in the championship game, although it lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting in an area rich with excellent football programs, from USC and UCLA 
on down, Shoup not only managed to compete nationally at his level but also to 
produce players good enough to go on to the National Football League. Running 
back Hank Bauer (San Diego Chargers) and linebacker Brian Kelley (New York 
Giants) had moments of stardom in pro ball. So did linebacker Sam Cvijanovich, 
a Canadian Football League Rookie of the Year. Tight end Ralph Miller played 
for the Houston Oilers, defensive lineman Charlie McShane for the Seattle 
Seahawks. In all, more than a dozen Kingsmen have gone on to play pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup didn't have a lot to offer, but he always seemed to find a way to recruit 
the talent. One player from the inner city, linebacker Louis Dubose, once was 
asked how he wound up at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he replied, "I was at this awards thing when a little white man came up 
behind me and said, 'Son, how would you like to be on TV?' " 
</P>
<P>
So the TV turned out to be a small, local cable channel. What the heck. Dubose 
came anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As the legend of the Kingsmen grew, so did the power of Shoup, who also was 
influential in getting the Cowboys to make CLU their summer training site 
beginning in 1963. That brought in more dollars, more campus improvements and 
more notoriety to the little school. 
</P>
<P>
But some complained that Shoup was using his power only for his own program. 
One basketball coach left in disgust, claiming that there were never enough 
funds left after football for his program and others. 
</P>
<P>
Some claimed that Shoup, with the alumni in his pocket, was more powerful than 
the college president. 
</P>
<P>
But few could dispute that he had put the school on the map. 
</P>
<P>
Short and slight of build, Shoup looks more like a minister than a football 
coach, but he can be both. 
</P>
<P>
Deeply religious, he can get on his knees and pray in front of the team, then 
send it out fired up to kill -- figuratively speaking, of course -- for the 
greater glory of the purple and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes too fired up. 
</P>
<P>
In the championship game against Texas Lutheran in 1975, CLC, unbeaten to that 
point, was blown out, 34-8. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the game, the cause obviously lost, quarterback Bill Wilson was calling 
a play in the huddle when he was interrupted by running back Hank Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," Bauer said, "we know we can't win. Forget this. Why don't we just pick 
one guy on the other team and kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Kingsmen were so good for so long, defeat became almost unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in his life, at age 57, Bob Shoup figured to be in the twilight 
of his glory. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he finds himself in the twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
But on a recent afternoon, he seemed at peace with his circumstances. He sat in 
his office, surrounded by trophies and other accolades, and talked about both 
the glory days of the distant past and the gory days of the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
"I was, I guess, the spearhead of the feeling that we ought to look at more 
options than just the SCIAC," he said. "I really felt we ought to look at the 
possibility of being an NAIA independent. That's where all of our success 
really came. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there were some other conferences we might take a look at. If we were 
giving scholarships just up to tuition, and if we were competing against 
schools that just gave scholarships only to tuition, we could be competitive. I 
felt it was premature for us to move." 
</P>
<P>
But his protests fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overruled. There were those who felt the changes could be handled and 
Cal Lutheran could make another transition. And, hey, I don't like to lose. But 
it hasn't destroyed me." 
</P>
<P>
Would it have been better, in retrospect, not to have moved up to the WFC after 
so many successful years in the NAIA? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a good thing for the institution," he said. "I think it gave us 
credibility with the media that the NAIA never had in California. California is 
an NCAA state. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to have been successful. You coach with the idea of 
winning. But I think also you try to be competitive. I think it was good for 
Cal Lutheran to be able to play against some really good programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were certainly those that felt, because of our reputation, we could be a 
contending Cinderella story in the Western Football Conference. That was never 
realistic." 
</P>
<P>
With his record and place in school history secure, and with a new course set 
that he doesn't really want to follow, why not just call it a career? Wasn't 
there a temptation not to come back? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it was more than a temptation," he said. "It was a strong feeling. 
This is going to be an ugly period. It's going to be difficult. It's not going 
to be fun. Some of my best friends have wondered, why do I continue? 
</P>
<P>
"My wife, Helen, and I took time and talked about it and decided it was better 
all around if I coached in 1989, better for the players, better for the 
program. The program could not suffer another major change at this time. I 
don't want the players to feel the apple cart has been upset here at Cal 
Lutheran and let's transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about 1989. I have tremendous respect for the players and 
coaches that stayed in the midst of all the controversy. It was easy to pack 
your bags and leave. To say, 'It isn't the Cal Lutheran I knew.' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good about this season and I want to be a part of that. But I 
recognize that to play what is really a Division II schedule under Division III 
rules is maybe as big a challenge as we had in starting the program in 1962." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one knows better what Shoup is going through in this period of 
transition than his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you end a career, it really hurts," said Helen, who saw all three of 
the couple's children go through CLU and now works in the business office at 
the school. "He saw this program as if it were a child developing and he wants 
to leave it strong. We love this place. My goodness, we have had so many 
blessings here. We never dreamed all this would have happened to us. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves this sport, but where he feels God leads, he'll go. If this should be 
the end, we have so much to be thankful for. It'll be bittersweet. It'll be an 
adjustment and I'm sure we'll miss it. But I know we'll be able to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just always see Bob coaching. Being associated with a team is the most 
wonderful, exciting thing in the world. I wish everybody could have the 
experience. But I think Bob can be on the sidelines and cheer on the next 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
But just when that will be remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
School officials, negotiating Shoup's future behind the scenes, have nothing 
but good things to say about him. At least publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the 28 years of association with Coach Shoup," said Dennis Gillette, vice 
president of institutional advancement at the school, "we have seen him as an 
inspiration to thousands of young people. He has given positive recognition to 
this institution and to his sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Deeply religious, he has been an excellent role model for the young people who 
have had the opportunity to be with him. He is in the mold of a winner but 
brings an ethical sense to his sport and the university." 
</P>
<P>
The night before he talked to a reporter, Shoup had watched a TV program on 
Landry, showing him in retirement relaxing in a back-yard pool with his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I could relate to that," Shoup said. "He appeared to have made a good, 
positive adjustment. He's a born-again Christian. He said, 'doors close and 
doors open.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed with a great family, a tremendous coaching career at Cal 
Lutheran and marvelous friends. I count those as tremendous blessings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look forward to any emptiness. My life has been so full and I think it 
will continue to be full."

WESTLAKE ADVANCE SLOWED BY BUENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Scott has a pretty good idea of what Jim Benkert has been going through 
the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, it was Scott, the offensive whiz at Hart High, who left to become 
head football coach at lowly Buena. He transformed the Bulldogs into instant 
winners by taking them to the Southern Section Division II semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Benkert, too, walked away from a successful program -- as offensive coordinator 
at Crespi -- to take on a chore at Westlake, which has not been to the playoffs 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Thousand Oaks High, Buena defeated Westlake, 35-30, in a 
penalty-strewn nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Scott spoke of patience, afterward, of disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Benkert) has got to be disappointed," Scott said. "They outplayed us. 
He's got to at least look at it from that positive standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because I go to church on Sundays," the always jovial Scott added with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
No need to worry about Benkert, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this sends a message that Westlake football is back," he said. "I'm 
happy with the whole team. We're back. Even with all the penalties, we still 
scored 30 points." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were penalized 12 times for 124 yards. Buena, 12 for 113 yards. 
The Bulldogs, however, got 141 yards and a touchdown from tailback Tony 
Williams and 77 yards and two touchdowns from fullback Richard Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Isaacs, a senior who passed for 2,281 yards last season, accounted for 
177 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the Buena rushing attack was particularly intriguing given 
Scott's penchant and flair for the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"They were either blitzing or dropping off a lot of people," Scott explained. 
"We worked pretty hard on our running game because everybody tries to stop our 
passing. Somehow, we got famous for that." 
</P>
<P>
The eventual game-winning play, then, was true to form -- a pass from Isaacs to 
Williams that went for 35 yards with 6:35 remaining. It left the score, 35-24, 
and made Westlake tailback Luke Crawford's 28-yard option scoring pass to Erik 
Holcomb one minute later academic. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb, a sophomore, caught three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Preston, the Westlake junior in his second season as starting quarterback, 
completed just seven of 22 passes for 95 yards. He threw two interceptions. 
Westlake's rushing game helped only a little, gaining 144 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake was able to stay close in the first half on the strength of two short 
drives. The first, a 53-yard march, took four plays. The final one was a 
29-yard pass from Preston to Holcomb with 4:27 left in the first quarter that 
gave the Warriors a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The second came one play after Buena punter Bill Kirkland took a fourth-down 
snap off his chest, bobbled, and shanked a six-yard punt. Preston then hit 
Holcomb again, this time for 17 yards and a brief 16-14 advantage with 7:38 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, on its next possession, needed 14 plays to go 70 yards. The key gain was 
a pass interference call on Westlake cornerback Demetrius Wynn on a 
third-and-nine play that gave Buena a first down at Westlake's 37. 
</P>
<P>
Seven plays later, Richard Harris banged into the end zone from one yard. Buena 
led, 21-16, at the half. The touchdown was Harris' second of the half, the 
first coming on a four-yard run that gave the Bulldogs a 14-10 lead.

SMALL LEADS NOTRE DAME TO EASY WIN AT ALEMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame High fans were treated to a Small wonder Friday night at Alemany 
High. 
</P>
<P>
An Errol Small wonder, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame tailback ripped through the Alemany defense in a big way, 
scoring on runs of 43, seven and 89 yards as the Knights cruised to a 28-7 
nonleague victory. 
</P>
<P>
He also conducted a defensive clinic, intercepting two passes. 
</P>
<P>
Small, who was ranked among the top 22 players in the Southland in a recent 
poll of college recruiting services, attributed most of his success to the 
weighty Notre Dame line, although he did admit to some personal improvements 
over last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stronger, I'm faster and I'm definitely more focused," said Small, who 
finished with 197 yards in 14 carries -- an average of 14 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' defense, too, was focused -- but Small was just a blur. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys on him but he just ran through the tackles," said Alemany Coach 
Pat Blackburn, whose team held Notre Dame to 22 yards rushing en route to a 
17-7 win over the Knights last season. "I think he's going to do it to 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if Alemany might get back into the game when sophomore Terry 
Barnum scored on a 12-yard run with 3:45 left in the third quarter to trim the 
deficit to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the following drive Small fumbled. Brian Brison recovered 
and returned the ball 14 yards to the Notre Dame 36. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth-down pass from Alemany's Joey Rosselli to Bill Markowitz at the 
Knights' 15-yard line fell short, however, and Notre Dame took over with 10 
minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights were unable to move the ball and Alemany got one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
But two plays later, Rosselli threw his fourth interception -- this by Mike 
Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
On the following play, Small charged through the line, stumbled through the 
secondary, regained his balance and ran 89 yards for the clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Although he labeled it the best game of his career, Small started slowly, 
gaining 18 yards in his first four carries. Then, with 4:05 remaining in the 
first quarter and the Knights leading, 7-0, he struck, taking a pitch from 
quarterback Greg Andrachick and racing untouched 43 yards down the right 
sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second quarter, Small broke loose early and rambled 75 yards for 
an apparent touchdown. The play was nullified by a holding penalty, however. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:07 remaining in the first half, Andrachick connected with Guillermo 
Eguez on a 40-yard pass to the Alemany 7-yard line. Small scored on the 
following play to give the Knights a 21-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame scored first with 8:06 to play in the first quarter when Andrachick 
lofted a 31-yard pass to Kirk Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick threw only three passes but completed two for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Afarian was four for four on extra-point attempts for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli, a left-handed senior, completed 17 of 29 passes for 190 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Barnum, playing in his first varsity game after scoring 28 touchdowns last 
season for the freshman team, led Alemany rushers with 76 yards in 12 carries. 
Fellow sophomore Brison had 46 yards in six carries.

HART AIR ASSAULT FELLS CANYON, 30-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The more things change in the colorful football rivalry between Hart and Canyon 
highs, the more things stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in as many years -- and under the tutelage of as many head 
coaches -- Hart defeated Canyon, firing multiple weapons at the Cowboys to 
claim a 30-12 victory before an overflow crowd of approximately 8,000 on Friday 
night at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Coach Mike Herrington, the third Indian chief since 1987, made his return 
to his alma mater a success, unfolding a complex and balanced offense that 
piled up 397 yards against a befuddled Cowboy defense. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling the trigger was senior quarterback Rob Westervelt, the third prolific 
Hart quarterback in the past four years. Westervelt was sensational, completing 
18 of 24 passes for 263 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are great, the line, especially," Westervelt said. "All I needed 
was a little motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt capped two lengthy first-half drives with scoring passes of 11 and 
23 yards to John DePaco. He added a 10-yard touchdown to tight end Chad 
Fotheringham to open the scoring in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt completed 16 of his first 19 passes -- including a string of nine in 
a row -- for 234 yards. The Cowboy defense was unable to sack him. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington stopped short of declaring Westervelt a better quarterback than 
former Hart quarterbacks Jim Bonds, a 1987 graduate, and Darren Renfro, who 
graduated in 1988. But he didn't withhold his praise. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great game," a beaming Herrington said. "We talked about it in the 
coaches' meetings: If Robby's on, he's capable of having a great game. He's a 
little bit different than a Bonds or a Renfro. He sits in the pocket well and 
just waits and waits for a man to get open." 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of them. DePaco caught three passes for 49 yards. Lance 
Migita, a 5-foot-6 flanker, snared eight passes for 114 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tailback Howard Blackwell led all ballcarriers with 107 yards in 19 
carries -- including a 25-yard touchdown run with 3:06 to play that gave Hart a 
30-6 lead. He also caught four passes for 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew going in that we had a lot of receivers," Herrington said. "It was 
just a matter of which one catches the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Said Migita: "Robby and the rest of us, we all played together on the sophomore 
team. So, we're experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Harry Welch, whose team played without the services of standout 
tailback Chris Peery, who underwent surgery for a non-football injury earlier 
in the week, rolled up 238 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Tim Beidle completed 16 of 25 passes for 166 yards and a 
touchdown. Senior wide receiver Clint Beauer made nine catches for 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But without Peery, who watched from a wheelchair, the Cowboy offense was, for 
the most part, punchless. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had leadership from our experienced kids," Welch said. "This 
year, we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon did, however, receive the game's first break. Three plays into the game, 
Westervelt could not handle the snap from center on Hart's five-yard line. 
Linebacker Brad Weaver recovered and the Cowboys had a first and goal at the 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later against a stubborn Hart defense, tailback Mark Santos, who led 
Canyon ballcarriers with 68 yards in 16 carries, swept left for the touchdown. 
Steve Mann's extra-point attempt was wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'That's just six points, that's gonna happen' " Westervelt said. "I 
knew we were gonna score. We said, 'We're not gonna lose to these guys.' That's 
the way we were brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt led Hart 87 yards in 16 plays on its next series as the Indians took 
the lead for good. He completed five of six passes on the drive, including the 
11-yard pass to DePaco for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell accounted for 25 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
On Hart's next series, Westervelt marched the Indians 78 yards in eight plays, 
culminating with a 23-yard strike to DePaco in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The drive included completions of 20 and 13 yards to Blackwell and a 17-yard 
pass to Migita.

BIG DEFENSE LIFTS ROYAL TO WIN OVER CHAMINADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal High figured that if it kept the score close going into the fourth 
quarter, it might have a chance to beat favored Chaminade on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So when Royal found itself behind by only one point with 10 minutes left, 
things looked pretty good. And, sure enough, the Highlander defense came 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Senior linebacker Jesse Rosen returned an interception 24 yards for a touchdown 
and Scott O'Neil recorded a safety on a quarterback sack to spark a 19-11 upset 
at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a better start than last year," said Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt, whose 
team was beaten 28-12 by Chaminade in last year's opener. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade, a playoff team last year, opened this season with a young offensive 
line and an inexperienced quarterback -- not a promising combination when it 
comes to scoring points. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' leading rusher, Colin Havert, could muster only 30 yards in 11 
carries. And Jeff Meyer, a junior starting his first game, had two passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
But Meyer wasn't the only player who appeared nervous. Royal running back Rob 
Smith fumbled on the game's first play and Meyer fumbled it back on the next 
play. Then, Royal quarterback Charles Snyder returned the favor, fumbling the 
ball back on the ensuing snap. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the two teams suffered five fumbles and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
There were 224 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade opened the scoring in the first quarter when Mike Terzian kicked a 
42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Royal got rolling in the second quarter. Aided by an awakened running game and 
two pass-interference penalties, the Highlanders drove 50 yards for a touchdown 
and a 7-3 lead, Jon Banton scoring from 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With 59 seconds left in the half, Chaminade failed on a fourth-down attempt 
near midfield and Royal capitalized. Snyder threw 44 yards to Sean Mitchell and 
Matt Brinkman kicked a 27-yard field goal with six seconds remaining to give 
Royal a 10-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade came out storming in the second half, though. Felix Goodson returned 
a kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles made good on a two-point 
conversion to lead 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
The score stayed that way until early in the fourth quarter when Rosen provided 
his heroics, picking of a screen pass and running untouched to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big win," Rosen said. "It's the way to start the season."

AGOURA GETS DOSE OF REALITY IN 17-3 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Marmonte League is ready for Agoura High, but is Agoura ready for the 
Marmonte League? 
</P>
<P>
Agoura will make the quantum leap from Southern Section Division VIII to 
Division II next season, joining the Marmonte League, but based on Friday 
night's performance, Coach Frank Greminger's gutty little Chargers are hardly 
ready for the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura was swallowed up by a wild pack of hungry Panthers from Newbury Park in 
a nonleague opener, dropping a 17-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, which finished third in the Marmonte League last year, made 
Agoura look more like a Pop Warner club than a high school team, using its size 
advantage to wear the Chargers down in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep them off balance with some misdirection," Greminger said. 
"We're not big enough to go right at them." 
</P>
<P>
The tactic worked well enough for a half. Agoura used a variety of counter 
plays and rollouts to keep the aggressive Panthers at bay in the first half, 
running 35 plays to Newbury Park's 21. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers trailed at halftime, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park junior tailback Walter Thomas, who didn't carry the ball in the 
first half, broke loose for 57 yards in eight carries in the second half. The 
5-6, 145-pound back scored the Panthers' only second-half touchdown on a 
10-yard scamper with 4:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers scored first and were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jai Johnston completed a 47-yard pass in the second period to Shane 
Gallimore, who had beaten Damion Smith down the sideline, putting the ball on 
the Agoura 16. Johnston scored from 13 yards two plays later, and Brad Hanson's 
kick put Newbury Park ahead, 7-0, with 5:47 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston completed six of 10 passes in the first half for 104 yards and 
finished nine of 15 for 133 yards as Newbury Park stuck to the ground in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's counterpart, Agoura's Josh Smaler, had his problems meanwhile. 
Hounded by the Panther defensive line, Smaler was just eight of 23 for 82 yards 
and threw an interception in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, aided by a 15-yard face-mask penalty, moved to the Newbury Park 
12 late in the first half, and Todd Cribari booted a 28-yard field goal for 
Agoura's only points. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park countered with a 32-yard Hanson field goal in the third period, 
then put the game away on Thomas' touchdown run.

OAK PARK EDGES BORON IN POINTS, 13-12, AND IN UNIFORMED PLAYERS, 18-17

<P>
Oak Park, able to field only 18 players and competing without a head coach, 
defeated Boron, 13-12, Friday night at Oak Park High on a two-yard touchdown 
run by Kent Richter on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles were forced to play the game with a coaching committee of 10 people 
on the sideline in the wake of the resignation Wednesday of two-year head Coach 
Ron Veres. Veres, who quit after a dispute with school administrators, said 
late in the week that Oak Park had only eight players healthy enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
He was off by 10, however, and the 18 Eagles were one more than the number of 
players suited up by Boron, whose own team bus wasn't exactly bursting at the 
rivets on its 120-mile trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never concerned about having enough players," Oak Park Athletic 
Director Fred Yamano said before the game. "We knew we had 20 or so who would 
be able to play." 
</P>
<P>
Yamano was the leader of a coaching conglomerate that included school Principal 
Jeff Chancer, former assistant coach Roger Newell and a host of current 
assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The committee approach apparently worked, although the Eagles were nearly 
beaten by one Boron player, tailback Keith Fine. Fine shredded the Oak Park 
defense for 176 yards and two long touchdowns in 19 carries, including a 
dazzling 62-yard scoring run on Boron's first play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Oak Park's defense caused five turnovers in the game and held the Bobcats 
scoreless in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Richter set up his game-winning touchdown run by intercepting a pass and 
returning it 30 yards to the Boron 15. Three plays and a pass-interference call 
later, he scored. Mike Stern completed five of 12 passes for 69 yards, 
including a 37-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Gibbons on Oak Park's first 
possession. LANCE O'FALLON

Hill.

15-5, 15-10, 15-6, in its first game of the championship round at

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Stadium Authority Board has approved a reduction in rental terms 
with San Diego State for football games at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, approved by the board Thursday and sent to the City Council for 
its consideration, could save SDSU about $14,000 this year, said Jim Herrick, 
SDSU assistant athletic director for finance. 
</P>
<P>
Herrick said the agreement is expected to cut in half a rent increase scheduled 
to take effect this year under provisions of a 10-year lease that expires in 
1993. He said without the reduction, the school would have expected to pay 
about $130,000 in rent for its seven 1989 home games. 
</P>
<P>
Herrick said agreement was also reached in three other areas: The authority 
agreed to exempt preferred seating donations from its rental fees and limit its 
share of cable television revenue, and the school agreed to a reduced seating 
configuration. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU requested the rent reduction after the Chargers renegotiated provisions of 
their lease last year, said Jack McGrory, assistant city manager. The SDSU 
athletic department has been hurt the past two fiscal years by falling 
attendance at home football games and a rising deficit. CURT

NORTHROP IN MORE TROUBLE IN DISPUTE OVER MX TESTING DEVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop is under federal investigation for having built a $1.2-million machine 
to test a key component of the MX missile guidance system and for billing the 
government for the expense even though the Air Force had not given prior 
authorization for the equipment, congressional sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations are the focus of both criminal and civil investigations being 
conducted by the Justice Department in connection with a broader probe of 
Northrop's activities in the MX missile guidance program, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop sought approval from the Air Force to build the machine in September, 
1985, well after it had completed and begun to use it, according to documents 
obtained by The Times. Northrop billed the government for the machine before 
the authorization was sought, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio declined to comment on the investigation but 
said the company was "authorized to build (the machine) under our contracts, 
and the equipment was built with government knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
The machine, known as a dry integration test station, was intended to assess 
all parts of the guidance system component before it was fully assembled. The 
guidance device, called an inertial measurement unit, is the size of a 
basketball and is designed to float in a special fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop was supposed to be using a more advanced test machine that would 
evaluate the guidance device as it floated in a test tank. But the firm had 
fallen so far behind schedule in the development of the guidance system that 
engineers felt they needed to build the dry integration test station to get the 
program moving faster, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations under the criminal investigation are also part of a civil fraud 
suit in which two former Northrop employees have alleged that the company used 
fictitious companies to buy missile parts from unauthorized vendors. 
</P>
<P>
The employees who brought the civil case, Jeff Kroll and Dave Peterson, 
testified in congressional hearings in 1987 that Northrop had established a 
number of fictitious businesses to buy parts for the MX missile. Northrop 
turned to the fictitious businesses when its Pentagon-approved purchasing 
system fell behind schedule and could not supply badly needed parts, according 
to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The contract for the guidance system of the missile, which carries 10 nuclear 
warheads, requires exact traceability of parts, and purchases of parts must be 
made only from government-approved firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indictments Expected Soon 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department agreed Sept. 1 to join the civil case, according to 
Herbert Hafif, a Claremont attorney who is handling a number of cases against 
Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif said he could not comment directly on the criminal case, but he issued a 
statement that said the criminal investigation corroborates the civil probe 
conducted by his firm. Phillip E. Benson, an attorney at the Hafif office, said 
the Justice Department is seeking to keep the civil case under court seal. The 
case was bought under the federal False Claims Act, which allows individuals to 
sue on behalf of the government and permits the government to join such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, has been conducting a broad probe of Northrop's problems in the MX 
and B-2 bomber programs. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and some of its executives could be indicted in the MX guidance system 
case within as little as one month, congressional sources and Northrop 
employees said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they are preparing employees for an indictment," a Northrop 
employee said. "In the staff meetings throughout the company, they are telling 
us that we are going to hear about some indictments, but not to worry about it. 
They say it is just going to be a nuisance suit because the government has to 
have something for all the time it spent on this suit." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and two executives were indicted earlier this year on criminal fraud 
charges alleging that the company improperly tested the guidance system for a 
nuclear-armed cruise missile, which was built by a Northrop division not 
involved in the MX program. 
</P>
<P>
The company had also been charged with civil fraud on the MX program, but the 
Justice Department dropped those charges recently after it agreed to a 
settlement with Northrop that provided for monetary restitution to the 
government.

U.S. MAY INDICT 5 MORE OFFICIALS TIED TO DREXEL;

<P>
RACKETEERING CHARGES ARE THREATENED IN HOPE OF GETTING NEW TESTIMONY AGAINST 
MILKEN, OTHERS

<P>
Federal prosecutors in the racketeering case against former Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken have threatened to indict five more 
current or former officials in the firm's Beverly Hills office, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan have threatened to bring 
racketeering charges against the five as part of a new indictment expected in 
the Milken case, the sources said. But they said prosecutors are hoping that 
the five instead will agree to cooperate with the government and testify 
against Milken and other defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, it was also learned that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
in Los Angeles for the first time has taken on part of the continuing 
investigation of employees and clients of Drexel's junk bonds department. 
Prosecutors in Los Angeles have issued subpoenas to Guy O. Dove III, a former 
Drexel employee who for a time served as a money manager for a Bermuda-based 
holding company, Dove's lawyer confirmed. The lawyer, Patrick Wall, denied that 
his client was involved in any wrongdoing and said he doesn't know what 
specific allegations the prosecutors are looking at. But he said the subpoenas 
related to Dove's dealings with Drexel while he was employed by the Bermuda 
concern, Clarendon Group. 
</P>
<P>
The five current or former employees of Drexel's Beverly Hills office who are 
threatened with indictment by a federal grand jury in New York include Warren 
Trepp, a Drexel official who sat directly next to Milken at the junk bond 
department's trading desk; David Sydorick, a Drexel salesman believed to have 
some knowledge of the department's dealings with former stock speculator Ivan 
F. Boesky; Roy Johnson, another executive in the department; Alan Rosenthal, a 
former Drexel employee, and Peter Gardiner, a former trader under Milken. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sydorick had reached a tentative agreement with prosecutors 
for full immunity in exchange for his testimony, but the accord has been put in 
jeopardy because the Securities and Exchange Commission so far has been 
unwilling to agree to his lawyer's demand that the agency promise not to take 
civil action against Sydorick. Sydorick's lawyer, Alan B. Kaufman, declined to 
comment on discussions with the government but said: 
</P>
<P>
"We were informed last December that his name had come up in the investigation. 
Our position with the government has been consistently that there has been no 
basis on which he should be charged with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sydorick is believed to have knowledge of the junk bond department's "parking" 
of Philips Petroleum common stock in 1985 on behalf of Boesky. The 98-count 
racketeering and securities fraud indictment of Milken returned in March 
includes allegations about the transactions. Parking involves sham sales of 
securities and illegally hiding their true ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Decline Comment 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are thought to be especially eager to get Trepp to cooperate 
because they believe that his role as one of Milken's principal assistants gave 
him detailed knowledge of some of the transactions under investigation. But 
Trepp so far has turned down an offer of complete immunity from criminal 
prosecution in exchange for his testimony, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Rosenthal, Trepp and Gardiner already have met with Justice 
Department officials in Washington to try to talk them out of authorizing 
counts in the indictment under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act, or RICO, the sources said. Senior Justice Department 
officials must authorize any use of RICO in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear what specific transactions any charges against Johnson might 
relate to. But he is said to have knowledge of Drexel's dealings with Dove. 
Johnson failed to return a call to Drexel's office Friday, and a lawyer at the 
firm said to be representing him refused to confirm or deny that Johnson is a 
client. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kimelman, Rosenthal's lawyer, declined to make any comment on the 
investigation. Neither Rosenthal nor Gardiner could be located for comment on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A "superseding" indictment in the Milken case, naming additional defendants and 
containing new charges, had been expected by early next month. But sources said 
it is now unlikely before November. In addition to Milken, the current 
indictment names his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce L. 
Newberg. A trial in the case currently is scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
Sources also said the new indictment may include obstruction of justice charges 
against several of the defendants. The sources said the charges would relate to 
the alleged shredding of documents. But additional details of such charges 
couldn't be confirmed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unfairly Spread Rumor' 
</P>
<P>
As reported, the new indictment may also contain charges related to the junk 
bond department's handling of Storer Communications Inc. warrants when Storer 
was acquired by the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
Sources have said the government suspects that Drexel funneled some of the 
valuable warrants to the personal accounts of managers of mutual funds as an 
inducement to get them to buy Storer bonds that otherwise were difficult to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Milken resigned from Drexel in June and has since founded his own company, 
International Capital Access Group. He has denied any wrongdoing. When asked 
for comment about the possible new charges and new defendants, Martin 
Flumenbaum, one of Milken's lawyers, said in a written statement: "Stories such 
as these based on unnamed sources serve no purpose other than to unfairly 
spread rumor and innuendo. The continuing press leaks related to this case are 
designed to deny Mike Milken his right to a fair trial. Mike Milken has pleaded 
not guilty and will fight the charges in court, not in the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel is due to plead guilty on Monday to six felony counts under an agreement 
with prosecutors reached last December. The agreement requires Drexel to pay 
$650 million in penalties and gives the firm broad immunity from further 
prosecution.

FORD WANTS TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF HISPANIC DEALERS BY MID-'90S

<P>
Ford said Friday that it plans to try to double the number of its 
Hispanic-owned auto dealerships by the mid-1990s in a move to bolster its 
position within the growing Hispanic market. 
</P>
<P>
The program is similar to efforts by Ford and the other domestic auto makers to 
increase the number of black-owned car dealerships around the country. It also 
follows criticism by some minority groups of Japanese auto makers for their 
failure to open up import dealership opportunities to blacks and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the domestic industry's black dealership efforts, which were 
developed partly under pressure from the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Operation Push, 
Ford officials said they have not been working with any Hispanic organizations 
to create the dealership program. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are Hispanics with automotive experience and the financial 
capability to acquire a dealership; however it will be our job to find 
dealership opportunities for these individuals," said Robert Rewey, vice 
president for Ford's sales operations. "Ford will provide operational support

Ford said it currently has 40 Hispanic-owned dealerships and is aiming to 
increase that to at least 80 by the mid-1990s. A Ford spokesman did not know 
how many of the existing Hispanic dealerships are in California. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Ford said it now has 316 minority-owned dealerships around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rewey observed that Hispanics now represent 7.7% of the U.S. population and are 
forecast to become the nation's largest minority by 2010. "It has been 
estimated that Hispanics have $160 billion in disposable income, and that 
figure will grow considerably during the next decade," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford spokesman said the attempt to expand the number of Hispanic-owned 
dealerships should help Ford's marketing efforts in areas like Southern 
California that have large Hispanic populations.

CAMPEAU MAY SELL BLOOMINGDALE'S TO REDUCE DEBT LOAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Campeau Corp., the troubled Canadian owner of the largest collection of 
department stores in the United States, on Friday proposed a major overhaul 
that would include selling off its crown jewel, the Manhattan-based 
Bloomingdale's chain. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau, which has struggled with tremendous debts since its $6.6-billion 
acquisition of Federated Department Stores last year, said a management group 
led by Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub is putting together a buyout 
offer. The company noted that in the past there have been many expressions of 
interest in the glamorous chain, whose 17 stores from New York to Texas had 
sales of $1.19 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring, Campeau said, may involve a $250-million loan from its 
important minority shareholder, the Olympia &amp; York commercial real estate 
firm. Olympia &amp; York would hold just under 25% of the voting stock if it 
converted all of its debt securities to common stock; the chairman, Robert 
Campeau, controls 50% of the voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convertible Loan Sought 
</P>
<P>
The money would come in the form of a convertible secured loan, which means it 
could be turned in for stock in the Toronto-based Campeau. The proceeds would 
be used to pay debts that come due Thursday for its two big retail companies, 
the Federated and Allied Stores chains. The restructuring plan will be taken up 
by Campeau's board at a meeting on Tuesday, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the restructuring should not be interpreted as a 
sign of worsening financial trouble "because it is designed to forestall 
trouble." She said the restructuring would also create "an active new 
management role" for the Reichmann family, owners of Olympia &amp; York. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger would not say how large Olympia &amp; York's stake in Bloomingdale's 
would become if the company converted all of the debt into stock. 
</P>
<P>
On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Campeau's stock slid Friday by $2.75 ($3.25 
Canadian) to $15.90 ($18.75 Canadian) as investors worried about the company's 
financial health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Surprised 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts expressed surprise that the company would elect to give up 
Bloomingdale's, recalling that Robert Campeau has often said the store was a 
central reason that he battled R. H. Macy &amp; Co. for Federated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a jewel of a company, the part Campeau always said he wanted," said 
Walter Loeb, analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. "If he's 
selling it, this is a fire sale." 
</P>
<P>
Loeb said he expected to see wide interest in the sale, perhaps including bids 
from Japanese retailers. Loeb said it would make "good sense" for Traub to buy 
the company since he has been so central to its operations. Loeb said 
Bloomingdale's could fetch $1.2 billion, and speculated that Campeau might 
decide to seek other department stores in the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau said it decided to sell Bloomingdale's because as a "highly valued 
franchise" its sale offered the best chance of sharply reducing Campeau's debt 
in a single transaction. Bloomingdale's has the least in common with the 
company's other big chains and would be best able to function independently, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,000 Jobs Lost 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's battle for Federated, which included Bloomingdale's, rocked the 
retail industry, and about 5,000 jobs have been eliminated as Campeau has 
sought to cut his $8-billion debt. As part of the Federated deal, Campeau sold 
the company's Bullock's, Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin chains to R. H. Macy 
&amp; Co., its rival in the bidding for Federated. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's 240 other department stores include those of Abraham &amp; Straus, 
based in Brooklyn; the Bon Marche in Seattle; Jordan Marsh in Boston, and 
Burdine's in Miami. None of the company's department stores are in California, 
although Campeau owns the 137-store Ralphs grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
In the New York retail community, there was speculation Friday that Traub might 
be joined in his bid by Estee Lauder, the cosmetics company that has long done 
business with Bloomingdale's, and by Ralph Lauren, the fashion designer who got 
his big break at Bloomingdale's. Traub was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the sale came three days after the leading trade publication 
Women's Wear Daily carried a long and flattering profile of Traub. In one 
section, the article said: "Robert Campeau and his bankers may hold pieces of 
paper indicating ownership, but Bloomingdale's belongs to Traub."

AVON PLANNING TO SELL GIORGIO AND PARFUMS STERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Avon Products on Friday put up for sale Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums 
Stern, the booming prestige fragrance subsidiaries that it bought with much 
fanfare in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds would be used to reduce Avon's $1-billion debt, much of which was 
incurred after an ill-fated diversification four years ago into health-care 
businesses, spokesman John Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Diana K. Temple, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York, speculated that 
Avon could get $400 million for the two units, which have four of the top 10 
selling fragrances in the United States: Giorgio Beverly Hills, Red from 
Giorgio Beverly Hills, Oscar de la Renta and Uninhibited by Cher. Other brands 
include Perry Ellis, Valentino and Deneuve. 
</P>
<P>
Cox emphasized that Avon has not formally decided to sell the units but rather 
has hired the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to evaluate 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on speculation that Michael Gould, 46, president and 
chief executive of the units, might attempt a buyout. Gould, based in Giorgio 
Beverly Hills' Santa Monica headquarters, could not be reached for comment.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: FLEXIBLE SPENDING PLANS OFFER ATTRACTIVE CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many workers don't take advantage of one of the best ways to save money on 
contact lenses, prescription drugs, child care, cosmetic surgery or other 
medical or dependent care expenses. 
</P>
<P>
It's called a flexible spending account. Offered as an employee benefit by a 
growing number of larger companies -- but used by only a small fraction of 
eligible workers -- these accounts allow you to pay for medical or dependent 
care expenses using pretax income. That means you can save as much as 40% on 
those expenses because you can use money that otherwise would have gone to 
Uncle Sam in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And new Internal Revenue Service rules, due to take effect in January, could 
make these accounts more attractive to some workers by allowing full use of the 
plans immediately after opening them. 
</P>
<P>
Flexible spending accounts are offered by between 50% and 60% of the nation's 
1,000 largest industrial companies, estimates Mercer Meidinger Hansen, an 
employee benefits consulting firm. These plans allow you to place pretax 
earnings, taken from your salary each month through payroll deductions, into 
one or both of two types of accounts. 
</P>
<P>
One type allows you to use the money, usually up to $5,000, for dependent care 
expenses such as child or nursing home care. The other type allows you to use 
the funds, typically up to between $2,000 and $5,000, for health expenses not 
covered by your medical plan at work. Most plans allow health accounts to be 
used for almost any medical expense, including eyeglasses or contact lenses, 
dental work, hearing aids, cosmetic surgery, prescription drugs, psychiatric 
exams and wheelchairs. You even can use them to pay deductibles, premiums or 
co-payments on your company medical plan. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit is clear: The money you put into these accounts escapes not just 
federal income tax but Social Security and state income taxes as well. So for 
people in the highest tax brackets that could mean big savings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Big Catch 
</P>
<P>
There's another big advantage: Faced with rapidly growing medical costs, many 
firms are cutting back their contributions to employees' medical insurance, 
forcing workers to pay more of those costs themselves through higher premiums, 
deductibles, co-payments or other costs. But money in your flexible spending 
account can be used to pay those costs. 
</P>
<P>
"As companies cut back, these accounts will become more attractive," says 
Edward J. Susank, a principal in the Los Angeles office of Mercer Meidinger 
Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
There is one big catch, however: You must forfeit any money left over in your 
accounts after each year. In other words, use it or lose it. Your employer most 
likely will use the leftover money to defray costs of administering the 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
But hold on. If you estimate your annual expenses well, leftover funds 
shouldn't be a problem. The average worker with a flexible spending account 
does just that, only forfeiting $27 a year in health accounts and $15 a year on 
dependent-care versions, according to a survey by Hewitt Associates, an 
employee benefits consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you can set your contributions on the low side to minimize the 
possibility of forfeiture, says Duane C. Bollert, manager of the Los Angeles 
office of Hewitt Associates. Most employers require only a small monthly 
minimum contribution -- often as little as $10, he says. 
</P>
<P>
And even if you don't use all the money, what you save in taxes can more than 
offset the amount you forfeit. For example, if you put $1,000 into an account 
each year and you are in the top 33% federal tax bracket, you will save $330 in 
U.S. taxes right way. So even if you must forfeit $100, you'd still be better 
off by $230 than if you had not opened an account and had paid those medical 
expenses using after-tax dollars. And that's not counting your additional 
savings in Social Security and state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Change Jan. 1 
</P>
<P>
Also, there are ways of getting out of the accounts. If your personal 
circumstances change -- for example, you get divorced and no longer have 
dependents -- you can cut or increase your contributions, or drop the account 
entirely (but you cannot withdraw money you have already contributed). And you 
can always drop the account at the end of the annual enrollment period. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, concerns about forfeiting money are a major reason why many 
eligible workers don't open up flexible spending accounts. Only 20% to 25% of 
eligible workers are using health accounts, and only 3% use dependent-care 
ones, according to surveys by Hewitt Associates. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the lower use of dependent-care accounts: Families with lower 
incomes, generally around $20,000 or less, will save more money by paying for 
child care directly, Bollert says. That is because they can use the child-care 
tax credit, which allows you to take a portion (usually about 20%) of such 
expenses as a tax credit, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for lower use: You generally must report those receiving the 
money. That is because undocumented workers or others who don't want to report 
income to the IRS are often used as child-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
But new IRS rules, adopted in April and set to take effect Jan. 1, should make 
flexible spending accounts more attractive for most employees. The new rules 
require that employees contributing to a plan be allowed access immediately to 
the total amount of money that will build up in the account over the whole 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if you elect to contribute $100 a month, for a total of $1,200 
a year, and you incur a $1,200 medical expense immediately after opening an 
account, you are entitled to get the full amount right away. Previously, you 
would have only been allowed access to money already in the account -- in this 
case, $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
There is a flip side, however. Such immediate access is likely to prompt some 
companies -- particularly smaller ones with high employee turnover -- to reduce 
the maximum contributions they will allow or to require waiting periods before 
a worker is eligible, Mercer Meidinger's Susank predicts. Others may even drop 
the plans altogether. That is because of the risk to firms that some employees 
may file claims for the full annual amount and then leave those firms without 
having paid the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
But the negative impact may be limited. That's because maximums are expected to 
be cut only on the health versions of the accounts; expenses for dependent care 
don't pose the same risks because they are incurred gradually throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, most employees contribute only an average of $500 a year to health 
accounts. That is below the level where most companies are expected to lower 
their maximums.

The economic slowdown caught up with American consumers in July as they paid 
off $280 million more in credit than they borrowed, the Federal Reserve Board 
reported Friday. It was the first reduction in consumer debt in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts predicted that the decline in borrowing was temporary and, 
considering other reports indicating continued although slower economic growth, 
should pick up in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said consumer credit in July declined at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 0.5%, down from June's 4.7% gain. But even the June advance was revised 
downward from 5.1%, falling to $2.72 billion from $2.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The July decline was the first since January, 1987, when consumer debt fell 
$1.63 billion, or 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Auto loans, which fell for the second straight month, contributed most to the 
July credit cutback, the Fed reported.

WORLD CUP TRACK AND FIELD MEET;

PATRICKS WIN GOLD MEDALS, FAMILY STYLE

David Patrick said that the only better time he could remember having with his 
wife was their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 months since, they have had to clear many hurdles. But never have 
they done that with quite so much at stake, or with so many people watching, as 
they did here Friday night, when both became World Cup track champions. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick ran his fastest time of the year, 48.74 seconds, in winning the men's 
400-meter intermediate hurdles, the first event of the three-day meet. About 45 
minutes later, while Patrick was on the stand to receive his gold medal, his 
wife, Sandra Farmer-Patrick, won the women's 400-meter intermediate hurdles in 
53.84. 
</P>
<P>
It was a special occasion, although not entirely unprecedented. Earlier this 
summer, they became the first husband and wife to win U.S. track and field 
national championships in the same year since 1964, when Harold Connolly won 
the hammer throw and his wife, Olga, won the discus. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have become the first married couple to win gold medals in the same 
major international track and field competition since Czechoslovakia's Zatopeks 
in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Emil won the 5,000, the 10,000 and the marathon. 
His wife, Dana Zatopekova, won the javelin throw. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been horrible if I had lost after David won," said 
Farmer-Patrick, a 1985 graduate of Cal State L.A. "I told myself, 'Oh God, I 
won't be able to live with myself when I go back to the hotel.' " 
</P>
<P>
Or with David. 
</P>
<P>
One other U.S. athlete had a gold medal to celebrate when he returned to the 
team's hotel. Ten years after winning the long jump in his first World Cup at 
Montreal, Larry Myricks of Ontario, Calif. also won in his second with a jump 
of 27 feet 2 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. athletes won two other medals. Leroy Burrell of Houston ran the 100 meters 
in 10.15 seconds, finishing behind British sprinter Linford Christie's 10.10. 
Randy Barnes of Houston was third in the shot with a throw of 69-2 3/4. East 
Germany's Ulf Timmerman was first at 71-1 1/2 and Switzerland's Werner Guenthor 
second at 70-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine teams in each the men's and women's competitions in the World 
Cup, which is held every four years. Four teams represent countries, five 
geographical areas. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's standings, the United States leads with 42 points. Europe, Africa 
and Great Britain are tied for second with 39. In the women's standings, East 
Germany leads with 39 points. The United States is fifth with 26. 
</P>
<P>
One women's event, the high jump, was postponed until today because of a 
driving rain that fell through much of the opening night's activities. When 
Eliza Doolittle sang that the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain, she 
apparently had never been to Montjuic, which overlooks Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
There were 46,000 tickets sold, although not all of them were used, for an 
event chosen to re-inaugurate Montjuic Olympic Stadium, which opened in 1929 
and recently was renovated in anticipation of the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the mayor of 
Barcelona and the president of the Spanish track and field association were 
drenched as they performed their roles in the ceremony from the middle of the 
field. Spain's King Juan Carlos, meantime, officially dedicated the stadium 
from inside the royal box. It's good to be the king. 
</P>
<P>
But into everyone's life a little rain must fall. Patrick and Farmer-Patrick, 
who live near Austin, Tex., had their share last summer in the U.S. Olympic 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, 29, ran a personal record in the intermediate hurdles and finished so 
close to UCLA's Kevin Young for third place that both were allowed to take 
victory laps while the photo was studied. Young got the nod and the trip to 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer-Patrick, 27, finished first in her intermediate hurdles final, but she 
was disqualified for running out of her lane. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy rain fell before her race, causing a delay. When the meet resumed, her 
lane was changed from 5 to 6. But coming off the first turn, she got confused 
and moved back into Lane 5. 
</P>
<P>
That was particularly disappointing for Farmer-Patrick because she easily would 
have won a place on the Olympic team for her native Jamaica. Despite having 
lived most of her life in Brooklyn, she chose to compete for Jamaica until she 
married Patrick on Jan. 2, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After the Olympic trials, she wrote a letter to the Jamaican track and field 
association, explaining her decision to run for the United States. She said 
that she hoped the Jamaicans would reinstate her, but she never received a 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I would have run for Italy," she said. "I just wanted to go to 
the Olympic Games." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick said that he gave his wife a pep talk after last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that we were going to make everybody pay for what happened to us," 
he said. "We said we were going to challenge ourselves for four years, here for 
World Cup this year, at the Goodwill Games next year, at the World 
Championships the next year and back to Barcelona in '92." 
</P>
<P>
They earned their berths here by winning in June in the national championships 
at Houston. Farmer-Patrick ran first there, putting pressure on her husband. 
This time, the roles were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Patrick did not challenge for the lead early. But neither did he lose 
contact with his primary rivals, Nigeria's Henry Amike and Great Britain's Kris 
Akabussi. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick overtook Akabussi after the sixth hurdle and Amike after the seventh. 
Amike finished in 49.24, Akabussi in 49.42. 
</P>
<P>
Warming up outside the stadium, Farmer-Patrick was unable to watch her 
husband's race. But she heard about it from her coach within a few seconds 
after Patrick crossed the finish line. Then, it was her turn to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
She had not lost in 12 races this year, twice breaking the U.S. record, but she 
thought that this might be the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying, 'This is the one I'm going to lose. David's going to kill me.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if she might be prophetic when the Soviet Union's Tatiana 
Ledovskaya, silver medalist in the 1988 Summer Olympics, raced to an early 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Ledovskaya is a notoriously fast starter who often fades near the end. 
Farmer-Patrick passed her coming off the seventh hurdle and never looked back. 
Ledovskaya finished second in 54.68, more than eight-tenths of a second behind 
Farmer-Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't win that one on technique or physical conditioning," she said. "I won 
that one on guts and glory." 
</P>
<P>
Her victory did not make up for last year, she said. "But it's getting better."

WEEKEND RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
JOCKEYS' BATTLE BECOMES SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This year's Del Mar jockey competition will not be won. It will be survived. 
</P>
<P>
With four days left in the meeting, the standings show a tie at the top between 
Gary Stevens and Eddie Delahoussaye with 41 winners apiece. But Stevens 
suffered a broken right wrist in a spill Friday, and Delahoussaye won't be back 
from a suspension and a trip to Canada until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the door open for Laffit Pincay, champion at Santa Anita and 
Hollywood Park this year and five-time winner of the Del Mar title. The 
42-year-old Panamanian begins today's action in third place with 38 winners. 
</P>
<P>
But Pincay has been wrestling with an uncharacteristic slump that has lasted 
nearly three weeks. Since Aug. 21, when he topped the standings by four 
winners, Pincay has won with only eight of 85 mounts, including a zero-for-38 
slide along the way. 
</P>
<P>
If Pincay cannot take advantage of Stevens' misfortune, Delahoussaye appears a 
cinch to win his first Del Mar championship, a rare piece of good news after a 
disastrous beginning to the month of September. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Delahoussaye grounded by the suspension, he also lost two valuable 
mounts at the last minute because of illness and then injury -- Frankly Perfect 
in last Sunday's Arlington Million and Brisque in Monday's $300,000 Del Mar 
Invitational Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"And it still hasn't stopped," said Delahoussaye's agent, Terry Lipham, Friday 
morning. "Just today I lost a live mount for Monday with an injury. It's 
getting to the point where I'm afraid to name Eddie on a horse any more than 
five minutes before a race. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this whole thing bothers me more than it does my rider," Lipham 
added. "His attitude is, 'Hey, the title would be nice, but the important thing 
is to make it through the meet without getting hurt.' At the same time, I'm 
looking for a bridge to jump off." 
</P>
<P>
While the younger jockey generation staggers to the end of the meeting, the 
spotlight this weekend will be on a 58-year-old grandfather who can sympathize 
with every ache and pain. Bill Shoemaker, in the midst of his whistle-stop 
farewell tour, comes to Del Mar Sunday for his final appearance at the seaside 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker will be honored with a special ceremony after the fourth race. He 
also has been named to ride five horses, although his appearance contract -- 
reportedly in the $25,000 range -- calls for only three. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, however, nothing Shoemaker does Sunday will make his fans forget 
his most famous Del Mar exploits over the last 40 years. The highlights 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His first meeting title, won in 1949, when he was 18 and still an 
apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A record 94 victories at the 1954 meeting. The closest anyone has come in 
the ensuing 35 seasons is the total of 86 posted by Pincay in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The record for wins, set on Labor Day 1970, when Shoemaker rode No. 6,033 
to pass Johnny Longden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four straight victories in the Del Mar Futurity, 1971-74, with MacArthur 
Park, Groshawk, Such a Rush and Diabolo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eight wins in the Del Mar Handicap, beginning in 1950 with Frankly and most 
recently in 1987 with Swink. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker took six riding titles at Del Mar and remains the only jockey to have 
won as many as three straight. Stevens was poised to win a third consecutive 
title when his accident occured. 
</P>
<P>
While the jockey competition continues to be a riotous affair, Charlie 
Whittingham, Ron McAnally and Wayne Lukas are calmly going down to the wire for 
honors as top trainer of the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
The close race between the high-class stables of McAnally, with 15 wins, 
Whittingham with 12 and Lukas with 11 is indicative of the purse increases for 
top horses at Del Mar in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Only four of their 38 collective wins have been in claiming events. That's a 
far cry from the days when Del Mar was a haven for cheaper animals. The 
dominant trainers of the 1960s, '70s and early '80s were Farrell Jones, Bobby 
Frankel and Mike Mitchell, whose horses ran more often for price tags than gold 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, anymore. John Gosden -- the accomplished Englishman who wasn't even 
sure how to claim a horse when he started in California -- won the 1985 Del Mar 
title. Henry Moreno, the winner in '86, had a mixed barn of primarily allowance 
horses. And for the last two years, Lukas has taken control. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who won his only Del Mar title in 1972, refuses to get outwardly 
excited about the local standings. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning would be nice, but it really doesn't make that much difference," he 
said. "Just as long as we win the most money. That's what really counts." 
</P>
<P>
In that category, Whittingham is a cinch. He has won six stakes, tying a record 
he set in 1980, and he will try to set a new mark this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham will run Raintree Renegade in today's Osunitas Handicap, a minor 
race for fillies and mares. Sunday, he will run top-weighted Lively One in the 
$200,000 Del Mar-Breeders' Cup Handicap against the Lukas-trained On the Line, 
the country's most accomplished sprinter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron took off his mounts Friday because of illness. . . . Gary 
Stevens joins Fernando Valenzuela (concussion), Amir Cedeno (broken wrist) and 
Tony Guymon (broken ankle and collarbone) among the casualties this summer. . . 
. Bill Shoemaker rode Lively One to a second-place finish to Precisionist in 
the Del Mar-Breeders' Cup Handicap last year. Robbie Davis is the colt's 
regular rider now.

PRIZED COULD KEEP THIS CLOVER ROLLING IN MONEY 
</P>

<P>
Clover Racing Stables of Pasadena has only recently begun putting together 
racing syndications, but if a 3-year-old colt named Prized could spring another 
of his upsets Sunday at Woodbine, Clover would become one of those rare 
ownerships that wins two $1-million races in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
At 50-1, Martial Law won the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap for Clover in 
March, and although Prized won't go off anywhere near that price Sunday in the 
Molson Export Million, he's not expected to beat Clever Trevor, who since a 
13th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby has emerged as perhaps the third-best 
3-year-old -- behind Easy Goer and Sunday Silence -- in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Like his stablemate in the Big 'Cap, no one gave Prized much of a chance in the 
Swaps at Hollywood Park in late July, either. That stake figured to be in the 
bag for Sunday Silence, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and only 
four other horses showed up to run. 
</P>
<P>
Prized, trainer Neil Drysdale and jockey Eddie Delahoussaye put a hole in the 
bottom of that bag. Second by four lengths at the head of the stretch, Prized 
seemed to be hopelessly beaten, but inexplicably, Sunday Silence quit running, 
and Delahoussaye found another gear for his colt as they rallied for a 
three-quarter-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Prized's upset of Sunday Silence has been typical of the entire year for 
Clover, a consortium of almost 30 different partnerships that was started in 
1987 and is managed by Barry Irwin, a bloodstock agent and former columnist for 
the Daily Racing Form, and Jeff Siegel, a public handicapper whose daily 
selections appear in newspapers throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Clover has found itself in the clover because of unexpected finishes. The same 
day Martial Law paid $103 to win at Santa Anita, Galba won the New Orleans 
Handicap at the Fair Grounds and paid $63. Within the week, Prized won a small 
stake at Santa Anita, and Lizzy Hare, who got Clover going with a victory in 
the Del Mar Oaks in 1987, was a stakes winner at 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
Friday here, John Culver, one of the six Clover partners who race Prized, got 
out a pen and did some hypothetical figuring. Theoretical parlays are bogus, 
because they don't allow for the extra money that would affect the odds, but 
they're still fun, and after finishing his calculations, Culver said: "A $2 win 
parlay on those four horses -- Galba, Martial Law, Prized and Lizzy Hare -- 
would have been worth about $170,000." 
</P>
<P>
All of Clover's investments don't turn out to be a Martial Law or a Prized -- a 
$160,000 colt died of stomach complications almost before his racing career had 
started -- but Irwin and Siegel don't promise a Kentucky Derby rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We're changing people's lives," is the safe slogan Clover has used, and many 
of their investors come in more for the thrilling diversion than with high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Prized is still owned by Barbara LaCroix, who bred the horse -- a 
mating of her stallion, Kris S., with My Turbulent Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Clover bought its 50% interest in Prized soon after he scored an 8 1/2-length 
victory in a maiden race last December in the third start of his career. Clover 
syndicated its share in the colt for an estimated $340,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prized's last race was the Swaps. The colt has grown and matured since Drysdale 
first got him, but so has Clever Trevor, who has been installed as an 8-5 
favorite in the 1 1/4-mile Molson. 
</P>
<P>
Prized and Delahoussaye drew the inside post for the Molson, and the colt will 
carry 123 pounds, the weights based on the horses' records. Outside Prized, in 
order, come Domasca Dan, who is 4-1 with Sandy Hawley riding and carrying 117 
pounds; Pause Again, 30-1, Dave Penna, 117; Mercedes Won, 10-1, Lloyd Duffy, 
126; Clever Trevor, 8-5, Don Pettinger, 126; Doc's Leader, 15-1, Bill Fox, 117; 
Charlie Barley, 5-1, Robin Platts, 119, and Toledo Salamanca, 15-1, David 
Clark, 117.

Gary Stevens was thrown from his mount in the third race Friday and suffered a 
broken right wrist and cuts on his face that required stitches. He will be out 
for at least a month, agent Ray Kravagna said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was scheduled to ride Winning Colors today in the $100,000 Maskette 
Stakes at Belmont and On the Line in the $200,000 Budweiser Breeders' Cup 
Sunday at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Stevens' horse, Bin of Ice, ran into the inside rail 
midway through the stretch. The horse attempted to jump the plastic rail but 
could not clear it, causing the rail to splinter. Trainer Craig Lewis said his 
horse "was pretty cut up and took a lot of stitches." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens spent the night at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla and was due to undergo 
surgery for his broken wrist. DAVE McKIBBEN

CASE FUELS DRUG-TESTING FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
COLORADO COURT HELPS DRAW ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Derdeyn is a carpenter living in Hollywood, but perhaps someday he will 
be considered one of the architects of an acceptable drug-testing program in 
intercollegiate athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Derdeyn, a one-time distance runner at Colorado, is the latest to challenge the 
constitutionality of a university's drug program. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a district judge in Boulder, Colo., declared Colorado's program a 
violation of rights of privacy as well as an unlawful form of search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The university was ordered to discontinue its two-pronged administration of 
random rapid-eye exams and collection of urine specimens. 
</P>
<P>
Although it sent reverberations throughout the state, the ruling was simply 
another bump on the legal road of drug testing. It was not the first such 
challenge, nor experts agree, will it be the last. 
</P>
<P>
But when a case such as Colorado's is heard, the thorny issues are hotly 
debated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any kind of random testing where you take a group of people and just 
test them, and ask them to prove they are innocent of drug abuse is 
unconstitutional," said Derdeyn, who earned a degree in art after serving in 
the U.S. Army in West Germany. "Just because someone is playing college 
football (or running) does not necessarily mean they are on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Derdeyn, 31, said he encountered the drug program as a walk-on runner in the 
spring of 1986. By the time cross-country season approached later that year, he 
had asked the American Civil Liberties Union to file a suit on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Derdeyn maintains that the Boulder athletes are much less receptive to drugs 
than most at a school they call "Ski U." because of its party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen drug abuse up close," he said of experience in the army. "Athletes 
are way below normal. I thought my former teammates were great kids, but 
straight arrows almost to the point of being dull." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Colorado officials ranging from Gov. Roy Romer to university 
coaches have criticized the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision is discouraging," said Bill McCartney, football coach. "I'm 
worried about our players experimenting and sampling now. There is tremendous 
pressure on this campus to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the best interest of the student-athlete? I was so sure the judge 
would look at our program and say, 'That's the way it should be across the 
nation.' It's unacceptable, what he ruled. It's incomprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the ruling is comprehensible is a matter of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
For Derdeyn, as for Stanford diver Simone LeVant, whose 1987 challenge in Santa 
Clara County Superior Court forced the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. to 
cease postseason testing of Cardinal athletes, drug testing is an intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
For many coaches, administrators and NCAA officials, drug testing is a 
necessary inconvenience to ensure a fair playing field and preserve the image 
of their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
And where shall the twain meet? 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA wants to give the impression it's attempting to do something because 
it doesn't want drugs to affect its image," LeVant once said. "People seem to 
think that if you're not for drug testing, then you must be for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Said John Mason, a Washington attorney regarded as a constitutional expert on 
testing in the workplace: "I am a believer that people who are members of 
certain populations, I certainly include college football among them, ought to 
present themselves as drug free. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to play college football, given the importance of that to the 
university, the revenues involved, the prestige to the university, you're going 
to have to be clean." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Chen, of the Northern California chapter of the ACLU, argued in the Stanford 
case that athletes are no different from everyday employees. Although Chen 
received a favorable ruling, one that an appellate court will review sometime 
early next year, the judge allowed the NCAA to test Stanford players in men's 
basketball and football. The reason: Those sports had accounted for all 34 
positives of the 3,511 athletes the NCAA had tested nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains, however, should athletes be treated different from other 
students? 
</P>
<P>
Glen Mason, football coach at Kansas, thinks so. He said that when a football 
player in Lawrence, Kan., tests positive, he becomes front-page news. The 
message is clear: Athletes often are public figures, particularly in such 
college towns as Norman, Okla., or College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Whether athletes' status will someday be better defined is unknown. Mason, the 
Washington attorney who formerly was general counsel for the Federal Railroad 
Administration, expects the constitutional issues to be clarified within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has not molded concrete parameters on testing in the 
workplace except in specialized cases such as with railroad workers after 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The court has said that a compelling interest in the safety of lives or 
national security must be shown before it will allow infringements on basic 
freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Following that lead, the Boulder court said of the university's program: "It is 
only athletic games we are concerned with here." 
</P>
<P>
Said David Miller, the legal director of the Colorado chapter of the ACLU: 
"It's not national security or nuclear security, or in the case of the 
railroad, life and death circumstances. There's a large difference." 
</P>
<P>
Again, perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Carl James, Big Eight commissioner, summarily denounced the Colorado decision 
because players' safety was disregarded. He and his Big Eight coaches have a 
vested interest in Colorado, now the only conference school not testing. 
</P>
<P>
If an anabolic steroid user were to select a program, he might attend Colorado, 
where his use of those forbidden drugs could continue unbridled, they 
suggested. McCartney said he will not recruit those who use steroids, 
derivatives of the male hormone testosterone and purported to increase 
performance because of its tissue-building components. 
</P>
<P>
Still, without testing, McCartney said he is powerless to stop steroid use, 
although physical signs of the drugs are easily observed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because some track guy doesn't want to take the test, they should still 
allow football players to take it," said Jim Walden, Iowa State football coach. 
"There is nothing like football. Football is the only game where you organize 
violence. You need strength, speed, and an assassins' type mentality to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Buffaloes cannot be allowed to become larger Buffaloes through drugs. 
Giving them a physical advantage like that is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Merrily Dean Baker, NCAA assistant executive director, said testing was 
instituted in 1986 for just that reason. But where the courts do not concur, 
Baker said the NCAA is abiding by each decision. So far, only cases at 
Washington and Stanford have stopped the institution from testing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Boulder case did not involve the NCAA and pertains solely to 
Colorado schools, Baker said her organization is concerned that the ruling 
could encourage other similar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many variables it is difficult for us to sit and postulate what's 
going to happen in all 50 states," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Holland, senior associate athletic director at UCLA, said the Colorado 
case brings to light that each school must be judged on its own merits. 
Although most programs are similar, many have built-in intricacies catering to 
their student body. 
</P>
<P>
Holland believes that the UCLA program offers enough due process to respect 
individual rights because a Bruin athlete must test positive three times before 
being punished. At Colorado, first-time offenders are suspended from the team 
for a calendar year, a facet McCartney says gives the program teeth. 
</P>
<P>
The Boulder court, however, was more concerned with the administration of 
Colorado's test than punishment when Judge Joseph Bellipanni criticized the 
rapid-eye exam. 
</P>
<P>
Although a sidelight to the constitutional issues, the criticism casts a 
warning to all programs utilizing the eye exam, which judges the size of an eye 
pupil to determine drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's rapid-eye exam was instituted by Dr. Forest Tennant, executive 
director of California Health Projects, Inc., which include two dozen methadone 
clinics in Fresno, Santa Barbara and the Los Angeles area. Tennant, of West 
Covina, also is the drug adviser for the National Football League and NASCAR, 
the professional stock-car racing association. 
</P>
<P>
He has sold some universities on the merits of the rapid-eye test, which is not 
nearly as expensive as a urinalysis. The test first measures pupil size with a 
card called a pupilometer. Then, a trainer tests for the pupil's reaction to 
light. Next, the eye is observed for involuntary jerking, and finally, a 
subject is tested for convergence, being able to focus on an object coming 
toward him. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid-eye exam, which Tennant said he developed, has been widely criticized 
beyond the courtroom. Toxicologists question its scientific validity, and even 
John Mason, a staunch supporter of drug testing, called it "tea leaves." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was ever been punished or penalized except by the urinalysis," 
Colorado's McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Boulder court found that the rapid-eye exam was incorrect in 97% to 
98.5% of its cases. The court wrote that the test injected arbitrary judgments 
into a random selection process, and was used without the slightest probable 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant defended his eye test in an interview, saying Colorado trainers did not 
apply it correctly. He said his instructors, who showed Colorado trainer Dave 
Burton and his staff in 1986 how it works, might have failed to explain the 
tests' finer points. But later, he also said that the test is so simple that 
anyone can learn how to use it in an hour's lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever said (the eye test) had the scientific merit the urine test did," 
Tennant said. "Nobody said they shouldn't do urine tests and do eye tests. The 
eye test is when you don't have the money or resources to do the urine tests." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant also said that the eye exam would not be able to detect users who are 
not tolerant or do not have drugs in their system when the test is 
administered. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Colorado's administration of the exam, Burton said he received 
a certificate from Tennant stating he was capable of operating the test 
expertly. He said that he and his trainers had no problems with Tennant's 
instruction, but that the rapid-eye exam is not a reliable indicator when 
testing a population such as athletes, where there is little drug use in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to say we weren't doing it properly is not true," Burton said. "As 
late as last spring he asked me go out and talk to other schools about it. I 
think his ideas are sound. He should stand up to the criticism rather than duck 
it like this." 
</P>
<P>
Said the ACLU's Miller: "Forest Tennant has made a lot of money selling a 
useless tool to a lot of universities. The problem is, colleges have taken the 
easy way out." 
</P>
<P>
The opposite could be said of David Derdeyn, who realized the risks in 
challenging a university. He said that he was never harassed because of his 
actions and that about 50 athletes, including some football players, told him 
they supported his efforts. Derdeyn said about five told him they felt drug 
testing was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Needed or not, testing will not soon disappear. Derdeyn understands this as 
well as anyone. But he hopes his protests someday will help prevent the system 
from running unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
And until then, the legal battles will continue.

REAGAN HAS SURGERY FOR FLUID ON BRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan underwent "successful" surgery Friday in 
Rochester, Minn., to drain a "collection of old blood" on his brain, apparently 
the result of his horseback riding accident two months ago, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan is conscious and recovering in his room, where he is 
comfortable and in good spirits," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said shortly 
after the operation. He added that the surgery, which lasted slightly more than 
an hour, was "without complications." 
</P>
<P>
The buildup of blood and other fluids between the membranes that separate the 
brain and the skull is known as a chronic subdural hematoma. It was found 
during a "routine physical examination" at the Mayo Clinic, where the 
78-year-old Reagan and his wife, Nancy, frequently receive medical care, 
Weinberg said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routine Procedure 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan had not experienced any symptoms, his physicians recommended 
that the fluid, on the top of the right side of his brain, be removed in a 
routine procedure at St. Marys Hospital, a Mayo Foundation Hospital, Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan's care is being managed by a team of physicians and nurses 
from the Mayo Clinic who are completely satisfied with the result of today's 
procedure and with President Reagan's recuperation thus far," Weinberg added. 
He said that although "no further treatment is anticipated," Reagan will be 
"carefully monitored." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, returning to Washington aboard Air Force One from New Orleans, 
told reporters "I hope it's all right -- pray it's all right." 
</P>
<P>
The relatively common neurosurgical procedure is performed under general 
anesthesia. It consists of drilling small holes about the size of a dime, known 
as "burr holes," through the skull and drawing out the fluid by putting a tube 
through the burr hole and sucking it out with a syringe. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, one to three burr holes may be required and between four and 12 
ounces of fluid may be removed. In Reagan's case, one burr hole was apparently 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Neurosurgeons not connected with the case said the operation was usually 
successful for patients with the former President's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence H. Pitts, chairman of neurosurgery at San Francisco General 
Hospital, said the technique was "a fairly straightforward procedure." 
</P>
<P>
"In the vast majority of cases, all of the fluid can be extracted just through 
the burr holes," said Dr. Neil A. Martin of the UCLA Medical Center. Making a 
burr hole "does not involve any great risks to the brain or its blood supply." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that patients typically remained in the hospital for about a week 
and then continued to recuperate for at least several weeks outside the 
hospital. The "great majority" of patients recover fully, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The holes in the the skull are not patched, but fill with scar tissue. A small 
indentation of the scalp may result, but significant cosmetic problems are 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Potential complications include heart or lung problems related to the surgery 
and anesthesia and, rarely, infections. In addition, in about 10% of cases, the 
fluid reaccumulates, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic subdural hematomas contain blood and decayed blood cells. They are the 
long-term result of bleeding on the surface of the brain from veins that are 
damaged by head trauma. The hematomas may occur at any age, but are most likely 
to develop in infants and the elderly, whose blood vessels may be more fragile. 
</P>
<P>
The initial bump on the head may be relatively minor but fluid can continue to 
accumulate after the actual bleeding stops. This is because the concentration 
of blood and its breakdown products can attract fluids from surrounding 
tissues. 
</P>
<P>
If a sufficient amount of fluid accumulates, symptoms such as headaches, 
difficulty in walking, seizures or weakness of an arm or leg can develop. More 
severe head trauma may cause symptoms to develop within days or weeks of the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, a riding enthusiast, suffered bruises and scrapes July 4 when he was 
thrown from a bucking horse on a rocky downhill slope at a friend's ranch in 
the Mexican state of Sonora. At the time, news reports made no specific mention 
of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, Reagan was flown by helicopter to an Army hospital in 
Arizona, where physicians examined him, took X-rays, and pronounced him in 
excellent condition. After the examination, Reagan returned to the ranch to 
continue his vacation, against the advice of physicians who suggested that he 
remain at the hospital overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans, who live in Los Angeles, arrived in Rochester Wednesday evening 
and both underwent routine medical check-ups Thursday. Weinberg said that aside 
from the former President's hematoma, the Mayo Clinic physicians found the 
Reagans are "in excellent health." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg's statements about Reagan's illness did not indicate what tests were 
performed to diagnose the subdural hematoma. Usually this abnormality is 
diagnosed with a CT scan or an MRI scan, special radiological techniques to 
examine internal structures of the body. 
</P>
<P>
The statements also did not indicate why Reagan had undergone tests that might 
diagnose a brain problem if he was not experiencing symptoms. In addition, the 
spokesman did not indicate if worrisome abnormalities had been detected during 
his check-up. For example, when physicians examined the blood vessels in the 
back of the eye, they might have detected a swelling known as "papilledema" 
that may indicate high pressure within the skull. 
</P>
<P>
Many physicians do not recommend tests such as a CT scan of the brain for 
asymptomatic patients. "If somebody is having headaches, that is one thing," 
Martin said. "But a CT scan is not part of a routine physical examination." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had a series of health problems during the eight years he served as the 
nation's chief executive, including surgery for colon cancer in July, 1985, and 
surgery for an enlarged prostate in January, 1987. In March, 1981, he was shot 
in the chest in an attempt on his life. He underwent three hours of emergency 
surgery at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN'S BRAIN SURGERY: Former President Ronald Reagan underwent what a 
spokesman described as successful surgery Friday to drain a chronic subdural 
hematoma. The condition apparently resulted from the 78-year-old Reagan's 
horseback riding accident in July. 
</P>
<P>
The subdural hematoma is a build-up of blood and fluid beneath the dura mater, 
the fiber-like outermost layer of the membranes that surround the brain and 
spinal cord. The corrective surgery consists of drilling small holes about the 
size of a dime through the skull and draining the fluid.

BRADLEY TRIED TO INFLUENCE AUDIT, CONTROLLER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley attempted to "interfere" with an audit that later concluded 
that Bradley associate Juanita St. John, head of the Task Force for Africa/Los 
Angeles Relations, owes the city $260,000 in missing taxpayer funds, Controller 
Rick Tuttle said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has also learned that part of an ongoing Los Angeles police 
investigation into the task force is focusing on whether city funds were 
illegally transferred into the accounts of a real estate investment in which 
Bradley and St. John are partners. 
</P>
<P>
According to two sources familiar with the investigation, a copy of a canceled 
check obtained by the controller's office shows that St. John wrote herself a 
$5,127 check on the task force's bank account. The endorsement, sources said, 
indicates that the check was deposited into the account of Kathy St. John II, 
the real estate partnership named after St. John's daughter, who is on the 
mayor's paid City Hall staff. 
</P>
<P>
Juanita St. John's lawyer, Richard Hirsch, said he was unaware of the 
investigation into the transfer of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I really have no comment. I haven't seen it. I haven't discussed it with her. 
We'll just have to in due course deal with that as well as other issues," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the city controller released his report after a nearly five-month 
audit of the task force and its troubled finances. Bradley helped create the 
task force and kept it alive by pushing for $400,000 in city funds since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Tuttle said he was contacted in June by a longtime aide 
to the mayor, Anton Calleia, regarding three pending matters in the 
controller's audit, including a letter that disclosed the firing of Bradley's 
daughter, Phyllis, as an employee of the task force. Tuttle also said the 
mayor's office urged him to withdraw a request that St. John furnish city 
auditors with her federal income tax filings. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle called the attempts by the mayor's office to "influence" his audit 
"extremely inappropriate" and "unprecedented." The audit was released Friday, 
along with transcripts of interviews of Bradley and Calleia. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Calleia were not available for comment Friday. But the mayor, in 
earlier questioning under oath as part of the audit, denied trying to interfere 
with the probe of St. John, a friend and business associate. 
</P>
<P>
"Never was there any intention of, in any way, influencing or thwarting your 
audit," Bradley told Tuttle, according to the interview transcript. 
</P>
<P>
Said Calleia: "I want to state (as) emphatically as possible it was never my 
intent to influence the outcome of the audit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accusations Troubling' 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for Bradley at a City Hall press conference Friday, Deputy Mayor 
Michael Gage said, "I generally find Mr. Tuttle's accusations troubling, 
unfounded and political on its face." 
</P>
<P>
Several City Council members who reviewed the audit report Friday were critical 
of the alleged actions by the mayor and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very troubling," said Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the 
Governmental Efficiency Committee who will hold a hearing on the report next 
week. "These are very serious charges about potential tampering with the 
auditing process." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina said: "For the mayor's staff people to continue to 
be part of trying to cover up documentation that rightfully belongs to the 
public is a huge mistake, and its implications for the mayor . . . are very 
poor. It's just not a smart move on their part at all." 
</P>
<P>
The audit concluded that St. John owes the city more than $260,000, including 
$36,000 in interest. On Friday, Tuttle asked the city attorney and district 
attorney to investigate whether St. John should face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old St. John, who has filed for bankruptcy, already faces 
misdemeanor criminal charges for failing to respond to a city subpoena for 
records to account for the missing money. 
</P>
<P>
She withdrew $180,000 in cash and checks made out to herself from the task 
force account, the auditors found. They also allege that she commingled task 
force and personal funds in family checking accounts in violation of her city 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
St. John was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probably Knew About Letter 
</P>
<P>
Bradley interjected his office into the audit process when he learned that St. 
John had provided the controller with a copy of a letter that outlined the 
reasons why his daughter, Phyllis, was fired, Tuttle said. Gage acknowledged 
that Bradley probably knew about the letter because it involved his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was concerned that the controller's office might "leak" the 
confidential letter and violate his daughter's right to privacy, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine the embarrassment for the mayor if his daughter sued the 
city?" Gage asked. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley dispatched Calleia to the controller's office June 27 to speak with 
Tuttle. As controller, Tuttle is an elected official and not appointed by the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
When Calleia later was questioned about his actions, he told auditors on Aug. 
17 that he wanted to protect Bradley's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was that specifically a letter of dismissal of (Phyllis Bradley) 
from the task force should not be made part of the record because the 
individual had legitimate privacy rights to keep that confidential," Calleia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, the mayor told auditors that he was trying to protect the city 
from "liability" when he allowed Calleia to ask for the return of his 
daughter's termination letter. According to transcripts, Bradley said the city 
attorney's office agreed with his opinion that privacy laws and a mayor's 
executive directive prohibited the controller from obtaining the letter as part 
of his audit. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley told the auditors: "I did not see how you would blatantly, in the face 
of that law and the clear instructions of that executive directive, jeopardize 
the city by taking that letter and thus making it possible for someone to 
secure it." 
</P>
<P>
But the controller's office received approval from another division of the city 
attorney's office to look at the termination letter. 
</P>
<P>
"They were able to review the letter to see whether it had any impact on their 
audit," Senior Assistant City Atty. Peter Echeverria said. 
</P>
<P>
Calleia also told Tuttle that the amount of Phyllis Bradley's salary could not 
be released, according to the controller's report. The mayor's daughter was 
paid $9 an hour as a full-time secretary between July, 1985, and June, 1986, 
according to task force personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brushes With the Law 
</P>
<P>
The younger daughter of the mayor, Phyllis Bradley has had a number of brushes 
with the law. In 1984, she was sentenced to three years' probation for driving 
under the influence of drugs and possession of PCP. In 1980, she pleaded no 
contest to a single count of petty theft in connection with the theft of three 
blouses valued at $78 from the downtown May Co. store -- her third shoplifting 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Bradley could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to a memo Tuttle wrote to himself, the controller called Calleia 
shortly after the meeting to tell him that he was "out of place" to involve 
himself in the audit and his conversation was "improper." Tuttle noted that 
when Calleia again raised the subject of the Phyllis Bradley letter, the 
controller said, "Stay out of it, Anton." 
</P>
<P>
Calleia made two additional demands regarding St. John, according to Tuttle's 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, the mayor's aide asserted that the controller's office had no 
right to look at St. John's personal income tax returns and should withdraw its 
request for the records. 
</P>
<P>
During their interviews as part of the audit, Bradley and Calleia denied having 
any knowledge of Tuttle's allegation that Calleia had asked the controller's 
office to stop trying to obtain IRS records involving St. John. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall a conversation about IRS," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
According to audit documents, St. John later gave auditors copies of 1985, 1986 
and 1987 income tax forms to show the salary paid to her by the task force. 
However, Tuttle said, the IRS told his auditors that the forms were never 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
IRS spokeswoman Carole Shapiro said the department could not disclose whether 
St. John also faces tax questions stemming from her handling of funds for the 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
In the final instance of alleged interference, Calleia told Tuttle that his 
auditors had improperly disallowed one-half the cost of a New York hotel room 
charged to the task force account in 1986 for St. John and her husband, the 
report said. It is believed that Bradley learned of the disallowed hotel costs 
in conversations with St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said in the controller's interview that "normal (city) practice" 
permits spouses to travel with city employees to conferences and conventions 
and "simply charge the hotel (bill) to the city, even if their spouses stayed 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was a sudden departure" from policy that could affect thousands 
of city workers, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage noted Friday that both Bradley and Calleia made their remarks in 
interviews under oath, while Tuttle did not. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the characterization that Mr. Tuttle has put on this particular 
incident, I have grave doubts about Mr. Tuttle's forthrightness in this 
instance." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Gage's comment, Tuttle responded: "His inflammatory rhetoric and 
attempts at character assassination are nothing more than a deceitful effort to 
excuse the serious issues raised in our audit." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said Friday that he checked with the city attorney about possible 
violations of law involved in Bradley's attempts to influence the audit. He 
said he was advised that there appeared to be nothing illegal as far as the 
city attorney was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending in the controller's office is an audit of the city treasurer's 
operations, including a controversy over $2 million deposited in Far East 
National Bank, which Bradley served as an $18,000-a-year consultant. Bradley 
this year returned fees paid him. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been under investigation by the city attorney's office since April 
for possible conflicts of interest involving his business dealings with 
associates, including St. John. City Atty. James K. Hahn is due to release his 
office's report later this month. 
</P>
<P>
On the federal level, the local office of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's 
public integrity section in Washington are investigating Bradley for possible 
insider trading violations in his stock dealings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Bradley and St. John and several other investors formed a limited 
partnership to purchase vacant land in Riverside County. Bradley's investment 
in Kathy St. John II is between $10,000 and $100,000, according to his 
government financial disclosure statements. The forms show that Bradley holds 
more than a 10% interest in the investment. State law does not require the 
mayor to list the specific amount of his investment. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Doug Watson, who heads the police investigation of Bradley, declined to 
comment on the probe of the transfer of task force funds into Kathy St. John 
II. Watson said it will "be months" before the entire police investigation is 
finished. 
</P>

FINDINGS OF AFRICA TASK FORCE AUDIT 
</P>
<P>
* The city allocated $388,920 to the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles 
Relations over four years between July 1, 1985, and June 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Task force Executive Director Juanita St. John should repay the city 
$260,714, including $178,812 in "unaccounted-for cash," $5,505 in travel and 
other costs, $37,853 for unauthorized repayment of a task force bank loan, 
$2,400 for legal fees and $36,112 in interest on the money. 
</P>
<P>
* St. John commingled public and private funds in bank accounts, approved her 
own expenditures and signed checks payable to cash and herself. 
</P>
<P>
* Officials at UCLA, where the task force was located, advised the mayor's 
office on several occasions that the task force was delinquent in meeting its 
financial obligations to the university, but the mayor's office never brought 
the problem to the attention of city officials responsible for administering 
the task force contract. 
</P>
<P>
* City auditors determined that internal controls governing how the task force 
handled city funds "did not exist." There also were no written procedures 
regulating how task force funds should be administered. 
</P>
<P>
* St. John made some inconsistent statements to auditors. At one point, she 
told auditors that records detailing the finances of the task force were at her 
home. Later she said these records had been stolen during a burglary at the 
task force's UCLA office. No report on the burglary was ever made to campus 
police.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the South American war against cocaine traffic, Colombia is only one of many 
strategic theaters where traffickers enjoy a big advantage over anti-drug 
forces. Even if authorities could win the battle in Colombia, they could still 
lose the war. 
</P>
<P>
New U.S. aid for South America, proposed this week by President Bush, is 
unlikely by itself to improve bleak prospects for stopping cocaine at its 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews over the past several months, numerous officials near the front 
lines of the South American war have underlined a common concern: The 
continent's rugged geography, weak institutions and needy peoples give cocaine 
traffickers almost unlimited opportunities for exploitation. Despite 
enforcement crackdowns like the current one in Colombia, officials agree, South 
American cocaine traffic will probably thrive as long as there are 
multibillion-dollar markets for the illegal product in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I see law enforcement as buying time for demand-reduction programs in the 
United States to take hold," one Drug Enforcement Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian blitz against traffickers by President Virgilio Barco Vargas 
began Aug. 18, the same day that assassinations of a leading presidential 
candidate and the police commander in Medellin triggered public outrage over 
violence by the Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
How long the enforcement campaign keeps its momentum depends in part on how 
long the public outrage lasts, many Colombian analysts say. The storm might 
well blow over if the Medellin traffickers adopt the more discreet tactics of 
the rival Cali cartel, which favors bribery and useful connections over 
assassinations and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
If President Barco's battle results in a temporary reduction of cocaine moving 
out of Colombia, that might even be profitable for Colombian traffickers. 
Assuming that a curtailed supply could not meet U.S. demand, the shortage would 
force up drug prices and profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole interdiction theory is based on economic fallacies," a European 
diplomat said. "If you stop a ton, what you actually do is put up the price of 
cocaine. The Medellin cartel certainly doesn't suffer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others in the Wings 
</P>
<P>
Any traffickers caught and convicted in the Colombian crackdown would enjoy no 
windfall profits, of course. But even if some of the cartel kingpins were 
arrested, they would soon be replaced from the ranks of middle-level 
traffickers, some officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Others contend that the imprisonment of major traffickers will dissuade 
would-be drug lords from expanding. But in a continent where most people are 
poor, it is hard to calculate how many will risk their freedom for the lure of 
easy millions. 
</P>
<P>
Should the battle rage on, and should the Colombian government eventually win, 
the control centers of cocaine trafficking undoubtedly would shift to other 
South American countries. Colombia has nothing that is essential for the 
production and smuggling of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why they couldn't do it somewhere else," the European 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 80% of all cocaine that reaches the United States is refined in Colombia, 
but less than 20% of the coca leaves used in the refining process are grown 
here. Increasing amounts of cocaine hydrochloride, the purest form of the drug, 
are already being produced in Peru and Bolivia, where most coca leaves are 
grown and where traffickers would be eager to fill any temporary gap in the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes on an Opening 
</P>
<P>
Bolivian traffickers have long been looking for the kind of opening that the 
crackdown on Colombian traffickers might provide. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bolivians are getting tired of getting the short end of the stick with the 
Colombians," a DEA agent in Bolivia said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's anti-drug proposal includes $260 million in additional foreign 
aid, the first installment in a $2-billion plan for fighting cocaine production 
in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. But increased enforcement pressure in all three 
countries cannot dry up production, because Brazil and Venezuela are also 
beginning to make cocaine hydrochloride. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement officials in Colombia often say that the only way to control the 
traffic in South America is to eradicate coca and replace it with legal crops. 
And that is what U.S. policy is aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
In both Peru and Bolivia, however, officials admit that farmers are planting 
new coca bushes faster than old plants can be pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with eradication is political. Governments seem reluctant to 
provoke the hostility of hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers by taking 
away their best means of livelihood. Leftist opposition parties in both 
countries capitalize on the eradication programs, contending that the 
authorities are siding with U.S. imperialism against popular interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Impediment 
</P>
<P>
The sensitivity of the "imperialism" issue also makes it unlikely that South 
American governments will invite substantial contingents of U.S. security 
forces to join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
But the main impediment to eradication is economic. Farmers cannot come close 
to making as much money on fruit, vegetables, coffee or other legal crops as 
they make on coca. Some government officials argue that in the long run, the 
only way substitute crops can become nearly as profitable as coca is for the 
United States and other consumer countries to guarantee their purchase at 
attractive prices. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that coca crop substitution can be effective if farmers 
receive technical and financial aid for efficiently producing substitute crops 
while enforcement efforts effectively drive off drug buyers, making it hard for 
farmers to sell leaves or semi-refined cocaine paste at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, that kind of enforcement has not succeeded for any sustained 
period. The jungle regions where coca is grown in Peru and Bolivia are 
extensive and difficult to patrol. Peasants help keep security forces out of 
some coca-growing zones, and in Peru's coca-rich Huallaga River Valley, 
guerrillas make penetration doubly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no guerrillas in Bolivia's main coca-growing region, the 
Chapare, officers of the anti-narcotics police have been notorious for taking 
bribes from traffickers. The low pay of officials in general, and the fragility 
of institutional controls, make corruption a major enforcement problem anywhere 
in South America where traffickers deal in huge sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
If the cultivation of coca in Bolivia and Peru could somehow be stopped, it 
could be expanded in neighboring countries. In the past, coca has grown well in 
Ecuador. Colombia currently produces tens of thousands of acres and has the 
potential for much more. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were really to do a good job of eradication in Bolivia, my guess is 
that there would be a significant increase in coca production here," a DEA 
agent in Colombia said. 
</P>
<P>
And in the vast Amazon region of Brazil, a variety of coca called epadu is 
becoming widespread. The dense Amazon forest could hide enormous quantities of 
epadu if traffickers found it necessary to use the region as a major source of 
raw material. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, as large as the United States without Alaska, also offers infinite 
possibilities for trafficking routes. Many are already in use. Large 
hydrochloride laboratories have been uncovered in remote places in the 
Brazilian interior, and big shipments of cocaine powder have been seized coming 
from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Potential 
</P>
<P>
One DEA official in Brazil said the country has the potential to be a major 
producer of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that yet, but it's on the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that, increasingly, cocaine routes also go through Venezuela, 
Paraguay, Ecuador and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"When the police do manage to plug up a route for export, the bad guys quickly 
have two or three alternative routes," an American diplomat in Bogota said. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from another drug-consuming country draws what he calls an 
inevitable scenario starting with tough enforcement pressure in Colombia, a 
decline of trafficking through this country and a progressive displacement of 
hydrochloride production to Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the inevitable historical drift of cocaine production down the cone 
of South America," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he emphasized, the outcome of the South American cocaine war will 
depend on U.S. and European programs for discouraging consumption.

SENATE COMMITTEE AGREES TO REDUCE MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate's tax-writing committee reached preliminary agreement Friday to 
reduce the controversial surtax levied on the elderly under the Medicare 
catastrophic care program while cutting benefits for doctor bills and 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee's decision, a response to mounting protests by senior 
citizens, was the first key step in making major revisions in the catastrophic 
care program in an effort to save it from total repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Although the full Senate would need to approve any Finance Committee proposal 
and the House is working on a separate plan, it now appears inevitable that 
Congress will restructure the law it passed just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be substantial pressure for repeal, no matter what modifications 
are made," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) acknowledged 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Only 40% of America's 33 million Medicare beneficiaries -- those who pay 
federal income taxes -- would pay the surtax, but they have mounted widespread 
and effective protests. 
</P>
<P>
There was "a recognition that major changes had to be made," Finance Committee 
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said after leaving the closed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee has not yet reached an agreement on specific cuts in the 
surtax, which under current law would rise with income to a maximum of $800 per 
person after it takes effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Finance Committee spoke in favor of substantially reducing 
the $800 figure to ease the political pressure, although less than 6% of all 
Medicare beneficiaries would pay the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
Other senators favored keeping a high maximum but called for reducing the 
surtax rate, which, under current law, would be 15% of an individual's federal 
tax liability over $150. Reducing the rate would help a broader section of the 
Medicare population. 
</P>
<P>
But there was near-unanimous agreement at the committee session that the surtax 
must be reduced in some way to placate senior citizens who are angry about a 
tax that applies only to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we made major progress," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut in Benefits 
</P>
<P>
The committee generally agreed that the reduction in revenue from reducing the 
tax will force a curtailment of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing catastrophic program, Medicare would begin paying doctor 
bills in full next year once the beneficiary's 20% share of medical expenses 
reaches $1,370. Medicare currently pays 80% of doctor charges and the 
beneficiary 20%, with no ceiling on the beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses. 
</P>
<P>
To save money, committee members tentatively agreed to delay the full payment 
benefit until 1991 and to raise the out-of-pocket ceiling, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Another likely reduction in benefits is a major increase in the deductible for 
prescription drugs. Prescriptions would be covered by Medicare for the first 
time beginning in 1991, with the government paying 50% of charges after the 
beneficiary has paid $600. 
</P>
<P>
No decisions were reached Friday on the size of a new prescription drug 
deductible, although the Finance Committee staff has given the lawmakers 
proposals with deductibles ranging as high as $1,300. The committee is also 
considering restricting the kinds of drugs covered under the program. 
</P>
<P>
The committee does not plan to alter the expanded hospital benefits that took 
effect Jan. 1. Under those benefits, the beneficiary receives unlimited days of 
hospital care after paying $560 for the first day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seniors Say All Should Pay 
</P>
<P>
Some senior citizens' groups have argued that all taxpayers, not just the 
elderly, should help pay for a program that represents the biggest expansion of 
Medicare since it began in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The list of options prepared by the Finance Committee staff includes a proposal 
to raise to $60,000 the amount of earnings subject to the basic 1.45% Medicare 
tax. The current limit is $48,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen indicated that the committee members have not decided if they want the 
general population to help pay for catastrophic care coverage. Under current 
law, catastrophic care is financed by a dual tax system. The surtax is paid by 
those senior citizens who pay federal income tax, and a flat premium, $4 a 
month this year, is paid by all Medicare beneficiaries. The Finance Committee 
wants to cut the surtax without changing the flat premium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Raise Premium 
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee, by contrast, has approved a plan to raise 
the flat premium to make up for revenue that would be lost when the surtax is 
reduced. The Ways and Means Committee plan would increase the flat premium to 
$8.40 a month, increasing the burden on middle- and lower-income beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that Congress is moving to cope with the protests. "No one should 
despair about this," he said in a meeting with reporters. "The authors (of the 
law) knew the supplemental premium would cause substantial difficulty . . . . 
If you meet substantial political resistance, you modify it."

The outlawed Irish Republican Army said Friday that a British soldier's wife 
was shot and killed in the mistaken belief that she was a member of the British 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's slaying was the third IRA attack in two weeks but the first 
killing of a woman civilian in years of IRA attacks on British forces in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA on Friday acknowledged the killing. The Irish Republican Press Center 
in Dublin said she was shot "in the belief that she was a member of the British 
army garrison at Dortmund." 
</P>
<P>
A British Army spokeswoman identified the dead woman as Heidi Hazell, a West 
German citizen who had been married for two years and had no children. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a mood of anger here that our families, not just soldiers, can no 
longer go about their daily business normally," a British army spokeswoman told 
the Reuters news agency by telephone from the Moenchengladbach headquarters of 
the British Army of the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
Hazell was sitting in her parked car in Unna, near the Ruhr industrial city of 
Dortmund, when a man dressed in British army fatigues approached and fired 14 
rounds at her through the window, a prosecutor's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the weapon was a Soviet-made Kalashnikov submachine gun. The gunman 
escaped in a car driven by an accomplice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA is waging an underground war to oust British troops from Northern 
Ireland and join the province to the Irish republic.

SUMMER FUN IS OVER FOR THE FRENCH -- THE BICYCLE BANDIT IS CAUGHT

They finally caught the bicycling bank robber of the Loire Valley last week 
after his exploits -- nine successful bank robberies before he was nabbed on a 
tenth attempt -- had entertained France for more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Even the motive for his crimes satisfied the tradition of French crime. No need 
to cherchez la femme. Soon after his capture during a heist at a bank in the 
town of Les Herbiers in the Vendee region, Jean-Jacques Guillon, 28, who once 
used the name of a popular cheese as his alias, reportedly told police he had 
done it all for love. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was the girl," said a woman who identified herself as Guillon's 
stepmother at the small family farm near Chinon, a wine-growing town in the 
Loire Valley. "He started seeing her about two years ago. She lived about 70 
kilometers (42 miles) away. They were planning to live together." 
</P>
<P>
Another report in one of the regional newspapers suggested that the tall, 
sturdy Guillon (6-feet-3, 230 pounds) -- described by his rugby coach at the 
Chinon Sporting Club as a "gentle giant" -- may have been trying to raise money 
to save his father's struggling farm. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, it was a good tale for the French press. Beginning in May, 
reporters for the newspaper Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest began tracking 
the bicycling bank robber's holdups. One reporter dubbed him the "ecologist 
armed robber" because he did not waste any fossil fuels while committing his 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Another journalist, mimicking the breathless sports jargon used to describe the 
annual Tour de France bicycle race, described the series of robberies as 
different stages of a rigorous athletic test: 
</P>
<P>
"He set a tortuous pace, but at each staging point the record fell. Twenty 
thousand francs here; 50,000 francs there. But the Yellow Jersey (the shirt 
worn by the leading rider in the Tour de France race) finally went to a little 
savings and loan in the town of Melle: 430,000 francs." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," the chief investigator on the case said 
admiringly. "One job and he gets 430,000 francs ($70,000) -- something usually 
achieved by professional gangsters." 
</P>
<P>
In each robbery, the system was the same. The target was a small bank or 
savings institution in a small town with streets and alleys too narrow for 
automobiles to give chase. 
</P>
<P>
Always dressed in a blue jacket and a blue ski-cap and carrying a blue plastic 
bag -- hence, one of his nicknames, Le Grand Bleu, or the Big Blue -- the 
robber would enter the bank and wait patiently in line for his turn at the 
teller window. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he would inquire about opening an account, giving the pseudonym 
Gerard Roblochon. Roblochon is a famous French cheese, but, as one writer 
pointed out haughtily, not a blue cheese -- which would have fit in better with 
his color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he would pull out a revolver and demand all the money in the till. 
Money stuffed in his blue bag, he would back out of the bank and mount his 
faithful bike, not a fancy multigear racing machine but a clunky common vehicle 
with a bell. 
</P>
<P>
Pedaling furiously, he would beat his retreat on a narrow street, load the bike 
into his car, which bore phony license plates, and drive away. 
</P>
<P>
Police had nary a clue to his identity except for a blurred photograph taken by 
a hidden camera at one of his latest targets. Coincidentally, police had been 
in Les Herbiers a few days before, showing the photo to tellers who recognized 
Le Grand Bleu almost as soon as he crossed the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
Alerted by the tellers, two local police officers arrived but required the help 
of two passing firefighters to disarm the holdup man. On Thursday, Guillon was 
taken before a magistrate in La Roche-sur-Yon for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The chronicled exploits of the bicycle bank robber have provided a summer of 
diversion for the vacationing French. At the end, they were beginning to be 
compared to those of the 19th-Century literary character Rocambole, a rogue and 
a daring thief created by author Pierre Ponson du Terrail.

12 PROTESTERS WOUNDED; TUTU ACCUSES S. AFRICA OF TERRORISM

Police clashed with anti-government demonstrators Friday in townships of the 
volatile western Cape, wounding 12 people, as Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. 
Tutu accused the government of using terrorism to crush political unrest. 
</P>
<P>
In a late-afternoon bulletin, South African police reported more than a dozen 
street battles between police and demonstrators Friday and said they used 
pistol fire, shotgun bursts, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse mobs 
hurling stones and gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people, including seven police officers, were wounded and six 
others arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, a memorial service was held Friday for 28 people reported killed 
in clashes in black and mixed-race townships on election day, Wednesday -- one 
of the bloodiest days of violence since 1985. Human rights lawyers said up to 
200 were injured. A 29th person, a child, reportedly died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The service at St. Georges Cathedral was attended by about 500 people, 
including a number of Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish this was just a nightmare, and somebody would wake me up and tell me 
this is not true," the stern-faced Tutu, a Nobel Peace laureate, told a news 
conference punctuated by the lamentations of relatives of victims. 
</P>
<P>
"This (loss) has been forced upon us by a vicious government," he said. "This 
government terrorizes our people, and I hope the international community which 
opposes terrorism will note this." He also addressed the church service. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tutu and Rev. Allan Boesak, the Reformed Church leader, urged their 
followers to protest the killings by marching on Parliament when it convenes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok accused Tutu and Boesak of "deliberately 
misleading the world" about the violence. Police have confirmed only 15 deaths 
in the area Wednesday night, blaming most on factional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, a Law and Order Ministry spokesman said police are 
investigating foreign television news crews for allegedly broadcasting scenes 
of unrest internationally. Such broadcasts violate South African emergency 
regulations for the media.

GANDHI ANNOUNCES ACCORD TO PULL TROOPS FROM SRI LANKA

Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said Friday his government has reached 
preliminary agreement with Sri Lanka to withdraw 42,000 Indian soldiers sent to 
that island nation to end ethnic violence, the Press Trust of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted him as saying the agreement is subject to review and 
approval by Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached with Sri Lankan officials during this week's meeting of 
nonaligned nations in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted Gandhi as saying the accord is a "good agreement" covering all 
aspects of the Indian withdrawal from northeast Sri Lanka. Gandhi did not 
elaborate on what has been negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
India has removed about 3,000 troops since June 29 following appeals by 
Premadasa. Gandhi initially rejected Premadasa's demand for a rapid pullout, 
saying it would worsen the ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
A clash was averted when India agreed to a token withdrawal June 29, but the 
countries had failed to agree on a timetable for a complete pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The government says 17,000 people have been killed in a secessionist war 
involving minority Tamil rebels and also a backlash by radicals of the majority 
Sinhalese protesting the government's peace overtures to the Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
India sent its first troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm Tamil rebels who had 
agreed to surrender under an Indian-brokered peace accord. But the main rebel 
group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reneged and began attacking Indian 
soldiers. More troops were then sent in. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Sri Lanka said Friday that 19 people had died in ethnic violence 
since Wednesday.

U.S. URGES SOVIETS, CHINESE TO CUT ARMS TO CAMBODIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A senior Bush Administration official Friday called on the Soviet Union to hold 
down its shipments of arms to Cambodia and complained that the level of 
shipments has risen as Vietnam prepares to withdraw its troops from that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to an international symposium on Indochina, Richard H. Solomon, 
assistant secretary of state for East Asia, also urged China to limit its 
supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, the radical Communist faction blamed for the 
deaths of more than 1 million people when it ruled the country between 1975 and 
early 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon's remarks suggested that the Bush Administration is making a last-ditch 
effort to work with the Soviet Union and China in trying to prevent civil war 
from widening in Cambodia within the next few weeks. Vietnam has said it will 
pull out its remaining 26,000 troops by Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue comes back to whether the Cambodian factions, encouraged by their 
foreign supporters, can join together in a political process of national 
reconciliation," Solomon said. "The U.S. will use its influence to move events 
in this direction. China and the Soviet Union must do the same." 
</P>
<P>
China has given military, political and financial support to the Khmer Rouge 
for more than a decade. Since the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia that ousted 
the Khmer Rouge from power, the Soviet Union and Vietnam have backed the 
government in Phnom Penh headed by Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have supported the non-Communist resistance 
groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. These groups have also received support 
from China, and Sihanouk has repeatedly insisted that the Khmer Rouge be 
included in any new coalition government in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 Shipments Reported 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, a government spokesman said Thai intelligence officials reported 
that since the beginning of the year Moscow has sent at least 11 shipments of 
arms, weighing about 14,000 tons, into Cambodia through the port of Kampong Som 
alone, United Press International reported. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the shipments included more than 100 tanks and armored cars, 
along with large quantities of artillery, helicopter gunships, explosives and 
ammunition. In addition, he said, a squadron of 16 Soviet-made MIG jet fighters 
has arrived at an airport in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-nation peace conference to avert civil war in Cambodia ended in a 
stalemate in Paris last month after delegates failed to agree on the role the 
Khmer Rouge should play in a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Solomon emphasized once again that despite what he called the 
"genocidal violence" of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, the Bush Administration 
would still be willing to go along with a settlement in which the Khmer Rouge 
becomes part of a future coalition government in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"From an American perspective, we want no role for the Khmer Rouge in a future 
Cambodian government," he conceded in remarks to an international symposium in 
Los Angeles on the future of U.S.-Indochina relations. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the judgment of Prince Sihanouk, of China, and of the ASEAN (Assn. of 
Southeast Asian Nations) countries . . . has been that the chances for peace 
are better if the Khmer Rouge is included in a four-party interim government," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon's speech also reflected a growing concern by the Bush Administration 
that Soviet arms shipments could help the Hun Sen regime keep power in Cambodia 
after the Vietnamese pullout. 
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, which was sponsored by The Times, Times Mirror Co. and the 
Asia Society, other speakers also emphasized that the solution to the Cambodian 
problem must include the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"If you try to exclude the Khmer Rouge from a settlement, you invite civil war 
and continuation of the conflict in Cambodia," said Kishore Mahbubani, 
Singapore's deputy secretary of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the audience of more than 200 diplomats and scholars to stop viewing 
the Cambodia problem as a clear-cut moral dilemma, saying: "There are no 
morally clean positions. There are only morally ambiguous choices." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Khmer Rouge, a peaceful solution must also include three 
other crucial players -- Hun Sen, Sihanouk and Son Sann, head of the Khmer 
People's National Liberation Front, several speakers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the monthlong Paris conference, Mahbubani said, "The real untold 
story . . . is that Vietnam and Hun Sen came with no mandate to compromise on 
the two key issues" of power-sharing among the four groups and the role of the 
United Nations in a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing outcome of the Paris talks, speakers at the symposium 
described them as an important first step toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We Cambodians feel very encouraged that it took place at all," said Vora Huy 
Kanthoul, associate executive director of the United Cambodian Community in 
Long Beach. Noting that it takes time to find a political solution, he asked, 
"How can we expect to solve in a month a problem that took 20 years to 
develop?"

Nobel Peace laureate Mother Teresa suffered a heart attack Friday morning, 
three days after being admitted to a hospital, but her doctor said her 
condition has stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiologist A. Bardhaniding added that the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was 
in intensive care at Woodlands Hospital but refused to give any more details. 
</P>
<P>
The official All-India Radio said Mother Teresa, known worldwide for her work 
with the poor, was alert and was visited briefly by the governor of West Bengal 
state. Nuns at the Missionaries of Charity, which Mother Teresa founded in this 
eastern Indian city in 1950, said she was progressing well. 
</P>
<P>
"Her heart is much better, and her temperature is practically normal," said one 
nun, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa became ill Sunday night but insisted on attending Mass on Monday. 
Her condition deteriorated, and she was admitted Tuesday to the private 
hospital.

The newly reinstated rule requiring Gulf Coast shrimpers to put turtle-escape 
doors on their nets drew scattered protests Friday, including an apparently 
unsuccessful blockade in Louisiana waters. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that too much of the catch escapes with the endangered turtles 
because they must use so-called turtle excluder devices (TEDs). 
</P>
<P>
Shrimpers in Louisiana set up a 30-boat blockade of a shipping channel Friday 
morning, Coast Guard officials said, but ships were able to navigate around 
them.

A jury convicted an unemployed couple of third-degree murder Friday for 
starving their 14-year-old son during a six-week fast that the family endured 
while leaving nearly $4,000 for God and waiting for his help. 
</P>
<P>
Larry and Leona Cottam, who are Seventh-day Adventists, held hands and showed 
no emotion as jury foreman Maria Uitti read the guilty verdicts before the 
packed Luzerne County courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Cottam died Jan. 3 after the family had not eaten since Nov. 22. The 
Cottams' 12-year-old daughter, Laura, recovered from malnourishment and is in 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
Besides third-degree murder, which required a jury finding of malice on the 
part of Cottam, 39, and his wife, 38, the couple were found guilty of reckless 
endangerment and endangering the welfare of children. 
</P>
<P>
The Cottams remained free on $50,000 bail each posted by an anonymous 
benefactor. No sentencing date has been set. The Cottams face a maximum of 28 
years in prison.

It is a tradition as old as sailing ships and as uncompromising as the sea 
itself: Skippers are held accountable for what happens on their watch. And, 
whether they are sleeping in their staterooms or issuing orders on the bridge, 
everything that happens while they are at sea happens on their watch. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy, its traditions tempered by 20th-Century concepts of justice, has 
devised gradations of punishment and provided the accused with legal counsel 
and avenues of appeal. But, when an inquiry ends, in the words of a 1952 
editorial often quoted by naval historians, then "comes the cruel business of 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
This is what awaits Capt. Fred Moosally, the skipper of the battleship Iowa. In 
the four-month inquiry after the disastrous April explosion of the Iowa's No. 2 
gun turret, investigators found a welter of management, training and personnel 
deficiencies in the operation of the Iowa's 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Blamed for Accident 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators concluded that the deficiencies "did not cause the 
accident or contribute to the loss of life," Moosally and the Iowa's executive 
officer, Cmdr. John P. Morse, will be judged at an "admiral's mast." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation determined that the blast in all likelihood was caused by the 
"intentional intervention" of 24-year-old Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who 
is believed to have placed a detonating device between two sacks of gunpowder 
in the breech of the turret's center gun. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Moosally's "otherwise outstanding performance," the Navy's top brass 
concluded that neither he nor his executive officer should be subject to 
court-martial or relieved of his command. But the mast proceedings could result 
in letters of admonition, or, in a more severe move, letters of censure that 
could dog both officers' careers into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"In all probability, Capt. Moosally's career is over," said Eugene R. Fidell, a 
Navy-trained Washington attorney who regularly handles military justice cases. 
But Fidell and several former Navy skippers said the proceedings will be 
closely studied, as the Navy struggles to uphold the iron doctrine of 
accountability while bringing it in line with the realities of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upholding Naval Tradition 
</P>
<P>
"These investigations of the Navy's more administrative or management failures 
offer a late 20th-Century paradigm for the Navy as a human institution, a form 
of human activity," said Fidell. "What they tell us is that personal 
responsibility is still expected. It's a lovely picture of the continuity and 
the meaningfulness of naval tradition, even in the space age." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Moosally acknowledged the burdens of his rank. 
</P>
<P>
"I am responsible for everything that happens aboard my ship, and I have no 
excuses for the problem areas that were found aboard Iowa during the 
investigation," Moosally said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy investigation disclosed that the Iowa's center turret was an 
administrative shambles. Among the "systemic deficiencies" cited, no formal 
schedule of assignments was maintained, and sailors working in sensitive safety 
positions were not certified to carry out their jobs. Amid the remains of the 
47 victims of the turret blast, investigators found forbidden spark-producing 
items, such as rings and cigarette lighters. 
</P>
<P>
Moosally's superiors faulted the skipper and his executive officer for relying 
too heavily on outside inspections and subordinates' reports on the operation 
of the 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
"While delegation is expected and encouraged, proper execution of doctrine and 
directives is the responsibility of the commanding officer," wrote Adm. P. F. 
Carter Jr., commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command. "Accountability is 
the core value in the measurement of performance." 
</P>
<P>
It is a tradition that has no parallel elsewhere in American society. Cabinet 
secretaries and business executives rarely resign in disgrace and are seldom 
fired over the mistakes of distant subordinates. But, for Navy skippers, who 
have unparalleled authority on the open seas, it comes with the territory that 
a promising career can be ruined in an instant by the missteps of a young and 
inexperienced crew. 
</P>
<P>
"In our business," said one senior Navy officer, "the commanding officer is 
always responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, skipper of the Navy frigate Stark, was drummed out of 
the Navy after an Iraqi Exocet missile slammed into the ship's side in May, 
1987, killing 37 sailors. Brindel was blamed for the ship's failure to defend 
itself against the incoming missile, and it was no excuse that he was in his 
cabin at the time the missile hit. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does death exonerate the skipper. The captain of the U.S. minesweeper 
Hobson, Lt. Cmdr. William J. Tierney, was held accountable by a Navy board of 
inquiry when his ship turned sharply into the path of an aircraft carrier 
during night maneuvers in 1952, even though Tierney was one of the 176 sailors 
who drowned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Must Answer' for Deeds 
</P>
<P>
"The captain of a ship, like the captain of a state, is given honor and 
privileges and trust beyond any other men. But let him set the wrong course, 
let him touch ground, let him bring disaster to his ship or to his men, and he 
must answer for what he has done," the Wall Street Journal said in a subsequent 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
At least Tierney was awake. In 1969, preparing for a dawn exercise, Cmdr. 
Albert S. McLemore of the destroyer Frank E. Evans went to bed and turned 
command over to a junior officer. 
</P>
<P>
While McLemore slept, the Evans collided with an Australian aircraft carrier 
during night maneuvers, killing 53 of its crew. McLemore was nevertheless held 
accountable and was punished with a general court-martial, a letter of 
reprimand and the withdrawal of points needed for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Navy's tradition of accountability appears to have withstood the 
tides of ages, it has not been isolated from political currents. Many believe 
that, in recent years, especially, political factors and the changing nature of 
warfare have threatened to erode the old order. 
</P>
<P>
As political leaders increasingly call on the Navy and Marines to conduct 
operations in the twilight between war and peace, some experts believe that the 
iron doctrine of a skipper's accountability inevitably will lose its bite and 
its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
After then-President Ronald Reagan pronounced himself accountable for the 1983 
truck-bomb explosion at the U.S. Marine compound in Lebanon in which 241 U.S. 
Marines and sailors died, many Navy traditionalists grumbled that no commander 
had been made to walk the plank for military deficiencies in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in what many considered to be a notable exception to the rule of 
accountability, a Navy board of inquiry stopped short of recommending 
disciplinary action against Capt. Will C. Rogers III, the skipper of the Navy 
cruiser Vincennes. Rogers' ship shot down a civilian Iran Air jetliner on July 
3, killing all 290 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board called for a letter of reprimand for the ship's operations 
officer, who relayed inaccurate information that led Rogers to conclude that 
the approaching aircraft was an F-14 fighter, not an A-300 Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actions Called Justifiable 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the downing of the Iranian airliner, Reagan and Adm. William 
J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pronounced the captain's 
actions justifiable. Then-Vice President George Bush traveled to the United 
Nations to defend the action. Navy officers widely believe that those early 
statements put substantial pressure on investigators to prove Reagan and Crowe 
right. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Iowa explosion, Navy officials were quick to defend the 
recommissioned World War II-vintage battleships as safe, modern warships -- a 
factor that many believe may have led investigators to discount safety-related 
explanations in lieu of the theory that Hartwig intentionally caused the 
mid-Atlantic blast. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iowa investigation carried none of the international political 
implications of the Vincennes incident or the bombing of the Marine barracks in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, experts maintained that the Navy was able to reimpose its values 
and reassert the hoary captain's law.

DEUKMEJIAN CALLS ON BUSINESS LEADERS TO HELP PASS GAS TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian made his first major pitch Friday for support of a 
gasoline tax increase, urging about 1,000 business leaders to help him "pull 
out all the stops" to win voter approval of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy to go to the people and to say that we need them to 
join with us in paying this additional money for this far-reaching program," 
Deukmejian told business leaders at the annual Sacramento Host Breakfast. 
"We're going to need your help. We're going to need your financial assistance 
to succeed in getting our message effectively across to the public." 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who at first was only lukewarm to a gasoline tax increase and 
then finally embraced it after negotiations with legislative leaders, is now 
leading efforts to get a campaign under way to win voter approval of an 
$18.5-billion transportation plan and modifications in the state's spending 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation plan, developed during long negotiating sessions with 
legislative leaders, calls for hikes in truck weight fees of about 54% and a 
9-cents-a-gallon increase in the state's gasoline tax over a five-year period. 
At Deukmejian's insistence, the increases cannot go into effect unless voters 
approve the spending limit changes in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
By providing funds for more highway construction, upgrading of rural road 
systems, expansion of rail and mass transit services and street maintenance, 
Deukmejian said, the transportation program would provide "a green light for 
California's continued growth." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a plan that can relieve traffic gridlock on our highways and also 
unlock the true potential of California's economy for the years to come," 
Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Following his speech to the business leaders, Deukmejian told reporters he 
plans to contribute some of his own campaign funds to the effort to pass the 
ballot measure if there is nothing in new campaign finance laws to prohibit it. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who is not seeking reelection, has $770,000 remaining in his 
campaign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that backers of the tax increase would need to raise at least $5 
million for a statewide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated General Contractors has already promised to collect $1 million 
from its industry for the campaign. "As the first line beneficiaries of $18.5 
billion in transportation funding, we must set the example for others to 
follow," the organization's president, Carl Otto, told his members in a recent 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he will begin to set up a campaign organization and map 
strategy at an Oct. 5 meeting with supporters of the ballot measure.

SEN. LOCKYER TELLS OF BEING MOLESTED AS YOUNGSTER 
</P>

<P>
Legislation aimed at making it easier to prosecute stepfathers and others who 
molest children received an unexpected boost in the Senate on Friday when a 
lawmaker disclosed that as a youngster he was sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), Senate floor manager of the bill, 
dispassionately made the disclosure as the bill appeared to have run into 
trouble under a peppering of questions by colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco), then won 
quick passage on a 33-1 vote and was returned to the Assembly for approval of 
Senate amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the bill would enable prosecutors to try accused child molesters who 
lived with the victim or had recurring access to the youngster, even if the 
child could not cite specific dates or times of the molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer said prosecutors of child molesters often "can't make the case" because 
repeatedly abused children do not remember specific dates, places, times and 
locations of molestations. 
</P>
<P>
"As one who was sexually molested by a baby-sitter when I was young, I can't 
recall the dates," he told the Senate matter of factly. 
</P>
<P>
He added that "the way our minds work is to try to blur and forget those 
events." 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer admonished his colleagues: "You cannot let people who molest and twist 
young people . . . go unprosecuted because a 5-, or 10-, or 14-year-old child 
can't remember the date or place it occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Asked after the debate to elaborate on his own experience, Lockyer snapped: 
"I'm not going to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The bill would create a new felony crime of "continuous sexual abuse" of a 
child under 14 and would be aimed primarily, Lockyer said, at stepfathers or 
others who lived in the same home with the victim for at least three months or 
had recurring access to the youngster for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
During the three months, at least three sexual or lewd acts must be alleged to 
have occurred. If convicted, the molester could be sent to prison for six to 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But some senators voiced concern that schoolteachers or camp counselors could 
fall into the category of someone who had recurring access to a child and might 
be unfairly accused of molesting the boy or girl. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill goes too far," said Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who 
abstained from voting. 
</P>
<P>
He warned that "all sorts of problems" could be created because "children can 
allege certain things because they are unhappy with the teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) cast the single "no" vote against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sponsored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and was supported by 
law enforcement and women's organizations and the California PTA. It was 
opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also passed, on a 28-0 vote, and returned to the Assembly a bill by 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) making it a crime to possess 
pornography depicting children under 14 in sexual acts. Punishment would range 
from up to a year in jail to three years in prison, plus fines up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is against the law to sell or distribute smut involving minors. 
However, actual possession of such material is not prohibited.

STATE TIGHTENS CONTROLS ON PESTICIDE RESEARCH 
</P>

The state has tightened its oversight of pesticide research after finding that 
researchers working for a French chemical company exposed 19 volunteers to 
excessive levels of a pesticide that has made farm workers ill, state Food and 
Agriculture Department officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, working under contract for Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., changed 
procedures that had been approved by the state Food and Agriculture Department 
and exposed their human subjects to the pesticides for twice as long as should 
have been allowed, according to an investigation by the Food and Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were picking grapes in a test field sprayed with the pesticide 
Zolone. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the change, a great many of the people would have been taken out of 
the field and the study probably would have been ended," Jim Wells, a special 
assistant in the department's Pest Management Division, said of the 
Rhone-Poulenc study. "They didn't want to stop the study, so they just amended 
the protocol." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the company nor the researchers working under contract could be 
prosecuted because what they did was not covered in regulations in effect at 
that time, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Violations of Law' 
</P>
<P>
"There were no violations of law," he said. "We feel it was not really ethical. 
But we could not find it was technically illegal. All we could do is cry foul." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hansen, the California representative for Rhone-Poulenc, declined to 
comment on the report Friday afternoon. He referred all questions to the 
company's North Carolina headquarters, which were closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The research project was conducted in Visalia in August, 1988, after the 
company, under pressure from the state, stopped selling Zolone, which had 
poisoned more than 70 workers in grape fields during 1987. The state said the 
workers in Fresno and Madera counties suffered from headaches, nausea and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc was trying to show in the research that its product was safe 
enough to be used again in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms approved by the state, the company sent 30 paid workers to pick 
grapes in fields sprayed with Zolone and 22 to fields that had not been 
sprayed. The company originally agreed to pull its volunteers from the study if 
daily blood tests showed excessive pesticide exposure as detected by depressed 
levels of the enzyme cholinesterase in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Excessive Exposure Found 
</P>
<P>
But months after the six-day study was completed, the company's report on the 
research revealed that 19 of the volunteers had been exposed to excess levels 
of the pesticide but had not been pulled from the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"The study should have been stopped after three days," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Although three other participants became ill, doctors monitoring the study for 
the company determined that none suffered from depressed levels of 
cholinesterase and none had been overexposed to the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the investigation, the state has decided to establish a special 
board in cooperation with the University of California to approve any pesticide 
studies involving humans and will require written approval of any future 
changes in study procedures that have been approved by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Lightstone, a lobbyist for the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, said Friday that he welcomed the increased scrutiny but argued that 
the Zolone study never should have been approved by the department. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department agreed to the study even though its own research showed 
that the danger to humans from exposure to Zolone was undetermined. Lightstone 
said the department should have cleared the study proposal with doctors in the 
state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had any idea what the risks were of exposing these folks, and (the 
Department of Food and Agriculture) went ahead and approved the study anyway," 
he said. "Of course, we would like to see the procedures tightened."

THREAT TO TORTOISE CANCELS 2 DESERT MOTORCYCLE RACES 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, invoking for the first time federal 
protections recently provided the desert tortoise, has canceled two off-road 
vehicle races because of the potential threat they posed to the endangered 
reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
BLM officials said Friday that permits for the two motorcycle races, scheduled 
for Sunday, were denied because biologists did not have time to evaluate their 
impact on the tortoise and its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with the racers, but we also sympathize with the tortoise and we 
have to follow the law," said Barbara Maxfield, a BLM spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Off-road vehicle enthusiasts, who predicted the Aug. 4 listing of the tortoise 
as a federally endangered species would restrict their use of the desert, 
decried the decision, with some predicting it could be an omen of things to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very unfortunate," said Ed Waldheim of the American Motorcycle Assn. 
"These are controlled, totally authorized events on existing trails in areas 
designated for what we do." 
</P>
<P>
But Sierra Club activist Elden Hughes said: "Certain activities considered 
normal in the past will, and should, be affected by the listing. If off-road 
races destroy tortoises and tortoise burrows, then that's a no-no." 
</P>
<P>
The races, expected to draw 300 riders apiece, were to be held in Johnson 
Valley near Barstow and in the Spangler Hills near Ridgecrest. Both areas are 
open to off-road vehicle use. 
</P>
<P>
But under provisions of the "emergency" federal listing the tortoise now 
enjoys, the BLM must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before 
permitting races or other events that might harm the state's official reptile. 
Maxfield said there was not time for biologists to conduct that review before 
Sunday.

GILLESPIE BEDEVILS, FRUSTRATES HER CRITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
It looked like the perfect setting Friday for a political flaying. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic state Sen. Alan Robbins had finally managed to bring Roxani 
Gillespie, the beleaguered Republican insurance commissioner, before his Senate 
Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee to answer questions about delays 
in implementing Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins had also invited Gillespie's arch foe, Harvey Rosenfield, author of the 
insurance reform proposition, to take part in the proceedings. Rosenfield, in 
turn, brought along his close associate, Conway H. Collis, a member of the 
State Board of Equalization, an insurance reform activist and a potential 
candidate for Gillespie's job when it becomes elective next year. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins noted in a news release announcing the hearing in the State Building 
auditorium in downtown Los Angeles that Gillespie had canceled an Aug. 28 
committee appearance "due to back pain." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a bank of television news camera kliegs bathed the participants in 
glaring white light and reporters scribbled notes, Robbins observed, "I can 
tell you from experience that going into a hearing with Mr. Rosenfield can be a 
pain in the, uh, back." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that," replied Gillespie. "It's a generic back problem." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently meant to say genetic. If so, it was perhaps her only slip during 
the two-hour grilling. For when it was over, the imperturbable insurance 
commissioner had once again managed to bedevil and frustrate her critics, 
evading their questions, sometimes responding with non sequiturs and turning 
their criticisms back upon them. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she has had practice. Gillespie, a former insurance executive, has 
been under continuous criticism for alleged foot-dragging in implementing 
Proposition 103 since it was passed by voters last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Among its provisions, the measure calls for a 20% rollback of insurance rates 
from the 1987 level and mandates that individual auto insurance rates are to be 
determined mainly by personal driver records, limiting the weight given to the 
geographical areas in which drivers live. Currently so-called territorial 
factors are significant criteria in setting rates, resulting in urban dwellers 
paying higher rates than drivers who live in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The issues were complicated in June when the state Supreme Court ruled that 
insurance companies have the right to a fair return on investment. Gillespie 
called Allstate Insurance Co. into the first of a series of hearings on the 
fair return issue Wednesday but there was little progress. And the state 
Department of Insurance has not yet issued any regulations on how individual 
driver insurance rates will be set under provisions of the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been nine months since the voters approved Proposition 103," Robbins 
complained to Gillespie, whose job he had himself once considered seeking but 
now says he does not want. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court stayed the matter until June, replied Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no stay to prevent you from thinking," shot back Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
"Now wait a minute," the commissioner replied evenly, "if you're going to start 
like that, this is not going to be a very nice hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Both Rosenfield and Collis bore in on the commissioner -- citing a lawsuit they 
had filed against Gillespie on Thursday -- demanding that the commissioner set 
up a hearing to determine the elements of a fair rate of return for insurance 
companies before dealing with individual firms and to begin setting criteria to 
move away from the "territorial" system for driver rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie countered by calling her antagonists a "splinter group," because they 
were not joined in their lawsuit by the Consumers Union, a major consumer 
advocate in the case. "Apparently these folks would rather do what the 
insurance companies do and sue," she said of Rosenfield and Collis. 
</P>
<P>
She managed to reopen the debate over Proposition 103 as though it had not 
passed and blamed Rosenfield with authoring a measure that she maintained will 
cause an increase in rates for 70% of the state's motorists to make up for 
decreases in some geographical areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that what he is faced with," she said of Rosenfield, "is the 
mistake he authored." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) a member of the Senate insurance committee and 
another potential candidate for Gillespie's job, lending her a bit of support, 
pointed out concern over a new rate structure among constituents. 
</P>
<P>
But Doolittle added: 
</P>
<P>
"Roxani Gillespie, rightly or wrongly, has been portrayed as the Leona Helmsley 
of insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Collis replied that if the law is followed, good drivers will 
receive lower rates and bad drivers higher rates regardless of geographical 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield pointed out in frustration that Gillespie was reviving arguments 
that the voters had supposedly resolved with the passage of his proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins asked Gillespie at least seven times to explain how the Department of 
Insurance will deal with where a driver lives in arriving at criteria for 
setting auto insurance rates under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Each time she evaded the question, sometimes blaming the Legislature for not 
dealing with the high cost of insurance: "Because the Legislature has been 
incapable of doing anything, we (the Department of Insurance) are going to have 
to do it. . . . What we are trying to do is come up with something that will 
protect both the people that are paying too (much) and those who are happy with 
what they are paying. And I don't think we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disclosure 'Shortly' 
</P>
<P>
Later she responded: "My policy is going to be to uphold the law and somehow 
find a way to protect as many people as possible. . . . The regulations will be 
made public shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: "Define 'shortly.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie: "It will be quickly." 
</P>
<P>
She finally promised that the proposed regulations would be issued this month. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the hearing, Gillespie hurriedly left the meeting room -- 
reporters trailing after her -- as she rushed to catch a plane for a meeting in 
Gov. George Deukmejian's Sacramento office. 
</P>
<P>
What about charges, she was asked, that she has exempted 184 insurance 
companies from any rate regulation? 
</P>
<P>
They are not exempted, she said over her shoulder, their rates can be set any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But why not schedule them for hearings? 
</P>
<P>
"They're teensy-weensy ones," she replied as she left the building. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, she is considering running for the job of insurance commissioner in 
1990, but now, she insists, Proposition 103 is her main concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made up my mind," she said. "Politics will just have to come second. 
. . . I'm committed to doing it right."

POP BEAT: SHAFFER TAKES HIS PARTY MUSIC 'COAST TO COAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"What is hip?" asked Paul Shaffer, the keyboardist who is musical director of 
TV's "Late Night With David Letterman." "It's hard to say. Why ask me? I'm not 
really hip." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, such modesty. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Letterman's show is a favorite among the young, hip crowd is because 
of Shaffer, who was in town recently from New York City to spread the word 
about his new Capitol album, "Coast to Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer may be an unlikely-looking hipster -- short, balding, 39 and, by his 
own admission, no glamour boy. 
</P>
<P>
But when you talk to Shaffer -- who wears tinted shades and has a distinctive 
voice -- you quickly get the sense of a confident, glib, witty, in-crowd sort 
of guy. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Letterman show's hang-loose atmosphere -- a sort of cozy nightclub 
feel -- is due to Shaffer. Besides leading the band through some punchy rock 
and R&amp;B, Shaffer contributes to the offbeat flair of the program by serving 
as a sweet-natured foil for Letterman's unremitting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
Savoring an afternoon aperitif in a quiet lounge of his Beverly Hills hotel, 
Shaffer did finally concede, "Well, the show is hip, but I'm just a cog in it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his playful, nonchalant manner on the Letterman show, Shaffer has 
established a reputation in the pop world as a quality musician, both through 
his playing on the air and touring with his group, the World's Most Dangerous 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
The new Capitol album, however, is his most ambitious outside venture. Each cut 
was recorded in a different city and features a noted performer -- such as 
Valerie Simpson, Brian Wilson, KC (of KC and the Sunshine Band) and Eric 
Burdon. 
</P>
<P>
Additional stars turn up in minor roles. On the doo-wop style "When the Radio 
Is On" (which has been released as a single), the background vocalists include 
Dion DiMucci, Carole King and the Fresh Prince. The vocal lineup on "What Is 
Soul" is longer and even more impressive, from Ben E. King and Bobby Womack to 
Darlene Love avis Staples. "Wang Dang Doodle" offers the stirring lead-guitar 
licks of Buddy Guy. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer, who has been playing the piano since age 6, said he wanted the album 
to have the feel of a coast-to-coast party, something with the musical flavor 
of a lot of different cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity for me to work with a lot of people I've wanted to 
record with and do the kind of music I love . . . rock 'n' roll and R&amp;B. 
Ballads didn't fit into this party atmosphere I wanted to create." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to co-writing and producing, Shaffer also does some singing. One of 
his brightest vocal moments is a duet with KC, the former disco king never 
known as a high-quality singer. Shaffer, who holds his own with KC, quipped: 
"If he makes good records with his voice, I knew there was hope for me." 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer grew up in a small Canadian town called Thunder Bay and became hooked 
at an early age on soul and rock by listening to the radio, especially U.S. 
stations that he could pick up in his area. It wasn't until he was in college 
in Toronto, however, that he began thinking about becoming a professional 
musician. His first big break was landing a position as musical director of the 
Toronto company of the musical "Godspell." 
</P>
<P>
He later moved to New York, playing piano in the band backing the Broadway 
musical "The Magic Show." Then, in 1975, Howard Shore, an old pal from Canada, 
got a job as musical director of a new television show called "Saturday Night 
Live" and invited Shaffer to join the band. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of the weekly grind (which included being Bill Murray's 
lounge-act sidekick and a hilarious impersonation of rock impresario Don 
Kirshner), Shaffer left the highly successful show to work as a studio 
musician. But the break from television didn't last long. Letterman, who was 
starting his late-night show, needed a musical director and he remembered 
Shaffer from "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
"When they (asked) what kind of band I wanted to put together, I said a group 
like you'd see in a smoky, late-night lounge that is a local hot spot," Shaffer 
recalled of his meeting with Letterman. "I love to play organ, so I wanted a 
band that would be based around the organ . . . a lot of soul music." 
</P>
<P>
To drive home his point, Shaffer told Letterman, "I want the band patterned 
after a group in this topless bar I knew in Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
For Letterman -- the man who'd eventually keep millions up to watch Stupid Pet 
Tricks -- it was an offer he couldn't refuse.

MICHAEL, HARRELL AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lucidity and purposefulness again marked the performances Hermann Michael 
elicited from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, when the West German conductor led 
the orchestra at the second concert of his two-night visit to Hollywood Bowl 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the extreme contrasts -- from deep quietude through extrovert 
bumptiousness -- to be found in both Richard Strauss's "Don Quixote" and 
Dvorak's Eighth Symphony were delivered and savored in ear-opening readings 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic does not always play with such conviction and neatness this 
late in a summer season. But then, not many conductors pay the orchestra the 
compliment of attempting to use all its many resources of color and dynamics in 
an outdoor setting, where those resources are not necessarily well perceived. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, with cellist Lynn Harrell the guest protagonist and Philharmonic 
principal violist Heiichiro Ohyama taking the secondary solo spotlight, Michael 
led a "Don Quixote" which found therein Strauss's sometimes neglected nuances 
and faceted pensiveness, as well as the expected heroism. 
</P>
<P>
It became a touching performance through Harrell's probing exploration of the 
Don's fantasy, poignancy and vulnerability. To dig this deep into the hero's 
character would be courageous at an indoor performance; to attempt it in an 
amphitheater seating 18,000 might seem foolhardy, except that on this occasion 
Harrell and his colleagues made it work. 
</P>
<P>
Ohyama's stylish and immaculate playing made a nimble foil to the cellist's 
virtuosic ruminations, and the other solo lines -- especially those contributed 
by concertmaster Sidney Weiss -- fleshed out the musical drama. 
</P>
<P>
Michael and the Philharmonic dug as deeply into Dvorak's familiar orgy of 
melody, producing freshness and spontaneity in a work already known for its 
irresistibility. 
</P>
<P>
This time, tune followed tune with a sense of the inevitable; climaxes emerged 
naturally and unforced, and each movement carried its proper weight to the 
happy conclusion. At that end, the crowd of 9,037 erupted with cheers and 
hollering, and that seemed perfectly natural, too.

SOME FUN WITH COWARD'S 'TALENT TO AMUSE' AT BACK ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Talent to Amuse" was how Noel Coward described his specialty. It's also the 
title of a new Coward revue at the Back Alley Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Using two men and one woman to sing Coward isn't a particularly novel idea. In 
fact, it's the same format that was followed by Roderick Cook's "Oh, Coward!," 
which was a hit in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
However, "A Talent to Amuse" isn't just a Coward revue. It's subtitled "A 
Musical Portrait of Noel Coward With a Few Sketches by Cole Porter." 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed among the 31 Coward selections in the show are half a dozen by 
Porter. And the text has Coward briefly paying homage to his American 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
In this context, Coward's "Nina," the tale of an Argentine lady who refuses to 
"begin the beguine," to quote Porter's immortal phrase, assumes the air of a 
rollicking transatlantic jab. And both Coward and Porter contributed lyrics to 
this show's version of "Let's Do It." 
</P>
<P>
This display of wits-across-the-sea creates some mild fun and, intentionally or 
not, allows us to conclude that Porter was the superior melodist. But Porter's 
contribution to the evening is so sporadic that it's hard to figure out its 
point -- unless, of course, it was simply to distinguish this show from "Oh, 
Coward!" 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the dramatic arc of "A Talent to Amuse" is well focused. The first 
act begins with Coward at his bitchiest ("Why Must the Show Go On?," "Mrs. 
Worthington") and gradually moves into more tolerant character sketches 
("Nina"). This pattern, silly to serious, is repeated in a section on travel 
(from "Why Do the Wrong People Travel?" to the angelic-sounding "Sail Away"). 
</P>
<P>
The second act more or less reverses the pattern, moving from grand romantic 
sentiments ("Someday I'll Find You") to the disillusionments of romance ("Never 
Again") to jokes about love affairs (Valerie Miller does "Mad About the Boy" 
strictly for laughs, flaunting a red boa and a thick but difficult-to-place 
accent), concluding with a selection of party songs. 
</P>
<P>
As the Coward surrogate, Mark Bartos demonstrates a delight in dishing as well 
as a knowing smile in the show's softer moments. The other singers, Miller and 
director Rick Roemer, have more of an American air about them (and, in fact, 
they do the more prominent Porter contributions). All of them handle lyrics 
with confidence and flair, and they're ably accompanied by Philip Orem at the 
grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer's staging occasionally falters (when he sings of "your fabulous face," 
it almost looks as if he's gazing at Bartos, which certainly wasn't the 
intent), but generally the trio's moves make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Evans dresses up the singers in proper fashion, but the John Ivo Gilles 
set is too drab for this show. 
</P>
<P>
"A Talent to Amuse" isn't as exciting as Roemer's staging of "Bittersuite" on 
this same stage. But there is talent here, and it amuses. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, please don't hum along with the singers, as the woman on my left 
did through much of the second act. While this may be proper behavior at, say, 
a hootenanny, it isn't quite right for a Coward revue. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15231 Burbank Blvd., Van Nuys, Saturdays at 3 and 10 p.m., Mondays through 
Wednesdays at 8 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $15-$18; (818) 780-2240.

A CHORUS OF APPROVAL FOR AYCKBOURN'S BACKSTAGE COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've got to get colleague Michael Wilmington down to South Coast Repertory to 
see "A Chorus of Disapproval." Reviewing the film version last week, Wilmington 
suggested that the story was probably a good deal funnier without frantic 
close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. Alan Ayckbourn's characters are wonderfully funny at South Coast, but 
they never ask for a laugh. In fact, a laugh is the last thing they want. How 
hard Ayckbourn's characters strive not to make fools of themselves, and how 
seldom they succeed! 
</P>
<P>
And although their creator is sorry for his creatures (particularly the 
females), he's not awash with compassion. They may be nice people, but that's 
not to say that they are good people. What crooks, what rogues, what rascals, 
these mortals be. In a small way, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus of Disapproval" is set in a town large enough to maintain an amateur 
light-opera group and small enough to make the arrangement of an extramarital 
affair difficult. This doesn't stop those inclined to such affairs, and the 
high season seems to coincide with the rehearsal of the annual light opera, 
here a revival of John Gay's "The Beggars' Opera" (1728). 
</P>
<P>
Who will play Macheath? Certainly not the cringing little fellow who forces 
himself to try out for a part as a step in recovering from the recent death of 
his wife. Actor Joe Spano makes him a man who would have some difficulty asking 
his neighbor to pass the butter. It's impossible to see him as an 18th-Century 
rake. 
</P>
<P>
In the immortal way of community-theater rehearsals, however, everything that 
can go wrong does. (Ayckbourn has run a small theater in the seaside town of 
Scarborough for 20 years, and only has to consult his diary here.) The part 
goes to . . . guess who. 
</P>
<P>
That might be enough for a funny one-joke play. But the joke gets better. Our 
hero also finds himself playing the role of Macheath offstage, more through the 
efforts of the ladies involved (including the director's wife, Caroline Smith) 
than through his own. 
</P>
<P>
Here we might think of Norman in Ayckbourn's "The Norman Conquests," another 
unprepossessing little man with a talent for pleasing the girls. But where 
Norman thought of himself as spreading joy, Spano makes it comically clear that 
our hero hardly thinks at all. He simply goes along with it -- a Macheath by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
He is also an honest man, and that gets him into trouble with the husbands. The 
end of the play, and also the beginning, shows what happens on opening night. 
An earlier Ayckbourn might have made it a catastrophe, with the set falling 
down and the actors bumping into each other. The mature Ayckbourn has something 
else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, this is a sad story. In the moment, David Emmes' SCR cast makes 
it a wonderfully entertaining evening. There's the fun of watching David 
Schramm trying to lash his amateurs into the semblance of a performance -- if 
only they were professionals, so he could fire them! -- and the parallel fun of 
watching Spano innocently falling prey to the ladies, including Anni Long, who 
has an extremely modern arrangement with her husband, Jarion Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Whether any of this is from Ayckbourn's diary, one doesn't know, but it feels 
observed, and the performances are equally observant. Note, for instance, how 
seldom the listener catches anyone forcing a British accent. The accent is 
simply there, and we can listen to the character. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we're aware that we are watching our favorite Southern 
California rep company, together again for the 81st time, and as fresh as ever 
-- Hal Landon Jr., for instance, a nice old gentlemen who bursts into tears if 
bullied, which guarantees that Schramm, a manly chap, will bully him. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who feels that Ayckbourn takes too dour a view of the human race simply 
hasn't been on the planet long enough. But while we're wincing, we're also 
smiling -- guilty creatures at the play. Beautifully designed by Michael Devine 
(sets) and Susan Denison Geller (costumes -- including some charmingly cheesy 
ones), "A Chorus of Disapproval" loses nothing in the original.

A FEW MOMENTS OF JOY FOR 'FROM THE HEART' STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those few viewers who have the patience to wade through the sheen of Academy 
Award gloss and canned speeches of "From the Heart," airing Sunday at 8 p.m. on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39, will be rewarded with some moments of pure, uplifting 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the producers of "From the Heart" don't make it easy, giving 
short shrift to the real stars of the show, the disabled artists whose truely 
formidable accomplishments are being celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
A TV special taped during a weeklong salute to the organization Very Special 
Arts, "From the Heart" is overloaded with celebrities -- ranging from Lauren 
Bacall to Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) -- introducing different artists and film 
clips. Few of the introductions ring true. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the artists' performances are jarringly intercut with clips that 
severely undermine the impact of their moments. One example: Dancer Zina 
Bethune performs with her wheelchair-bound counterpart, Sarah Anderson, while 
Amanda McBroom sings "The Rose" in the background . . . in between clips 
explaining the dance project where Anderson developed her talent. A very 
touching moment becomes almost irritating. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Douglas is one of the few celebs who adds to his segment. Douglas 
introduces playwright Neil Marcus and reads from one of Marcus' works in 
between scenes performed by Marcus, who is plagued by the crippling disease 
dystonia, and two actors. Douglas' reading is very effective; the performances 
are enhanced by it. 
</P>
<P>
" 'From the Heart' is not about disabled individuals," says Very Special Arts 
founder Jean Kennedy Smith. "It is about talented people." It's too bad that 
the producers didn't have the courage to let these individuals showcase their 
hard-won skills. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

'BEETLEJUICE' CARTOON SERIES DIGGING ITS OWN GRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"Beetlejuice," ABC's much-flacked new kidvid series based loosely -- very 
loosely -- on the 1988 hit film (airing at 9:30 a.m. today on Channels 7, 3, 10 
and 42) is such an unmitigated disaster, it may inspire future songwriters, 
supplanting the Titanic and the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burton's black comedy focused on the gentle pair of ghosts who befriended 
Lydia, the morbid, alienated daughter of the nouveau riche couple who bought 
their old home. Beetlejuice was a screaming, vulgar specter who tried to force 
Lydia into a "marriage" that would shame Humbert Humbert in "Lolita." 
</P>
<P>
In the cartoon version, Beetlejuice is still "a disgusting creep," but he's 
also Lydia's best friend, an improbable situation that strands the writers 
between the proverbial rock and hard place. They have to maintain the obnoxious 
behavior that defined the character, but they also have to establish his 
kindly, sentimental side. If the first episode is any indication, they can't 
resolve the conflict between the two sides of his personality, and the story 
jerks between extremes. 
</P>
<P>
The visuals only compound the story problems: "Beetlejuice" is the 
weirdest-looking Saturday morning show in years. Lydia and the title character 
are stiff caricatures of the original actors (she looks like a junior version 
of Morticia in "The Addams Family"); the supporting cast consists of lumpy, 
shapeless monsters. These unrelated styles make "Beetlejuice" look like 
segments from two different shows that were accidentally spliced together. The 
garish, Day-Glo backgrounds may distract the viewer's attention from the limits 
of the animation, but they can't disguise them, especially the unsuccessful 
attempts at metamorphoses. 
</P>
<P>
"Beetlejuice" is the only new program in ABC's Saturday morning lineup this 
season. Five shows premiere on NBC today, none of which was available for 
previewing; three new series begin on CBS next Saturday. After "Beetlejuice," 
the 1989-90 kidvid season seems to have to nowhere to go but up. CHARLES 
SOLOMON

FIRMS SETTLE SUIT OVER RACE BIAS IN ADS; 
</P>
<P>
AGREE TO PAY $325,000; LUXURY HOME PROMOTION EXCLUDED BLACKS 
</P>

<P>
In the largest settlement of its kind, the developers of a luxury home project 
in Maryland and the agency that designed its advertising have agreed to pay 
$325,000 for excluding blacks from their promotional campaign, attorneys said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 lawsuit filed by a black Washington resident charged that Avenel Corp. 
of Potomac, Md., used white models almost exclusively in its newspaper 
advertisements with the intent to discourage blacks from buying homes. 
</P>
<P>
"What these ads say to me is we don't want people like you living in our 
development," said Girardeau A. Spann, who filed the suit along with two local 
nonprofit housing organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discrimination Denied 
</P>
<P>
The company, however, denied any intent to discriminate. The settlement, 
approved by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, said that neither Avenel nor 
its advertising agency, Words &amp; Company, had admitted any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The housing organizations that participated in the lawsuit said that Avenel's 
current ads, which feature blacks, are "very nice." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, reached under the Fair Housing Act, which was amended in 1988 
to remove a $1,000 limit on damage awards, was by far the largest involving 
allegedly discriminatory advertising and among the largest for any kind of 
housing discrimination complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the real estate business need to see that there's a price for 
doing this," said lawyer David Webbert, who called de facto housing segregation 
a "major bastion of racism in the country." De facto segregation refers to 
discrimination maintained by custom or tradition rather than by law. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Avenel disputed that any of its ads were racist by implication or 
intent and said that the firm was never charged with discriminating in the 
sales of homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are firm believers in the Fair Housing Act and all that it stands for," 
said Tony Natelli, a partner in the firm. "We deny that we've done anything 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Citing mounting legal costs, Natelli said: "It just seemed sensible to settle." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement contains a provision requiring the company to continue using 
human models in its ads. The plaintiffs had argued that, in the past, companies 
stopped using all models rather than feature blacks in ads. 
</P>
<P>
Before passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, newspapers ran separate housing 
ads for blacks. Webbert said that, even into the 1970s, some real estate 
promotions were still labeled "whites only," in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"They got rid of the statement but kept the all-white ads," Webbert said, 
referring to more recent ads excluding blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after a survey showed that 98% of the real estate ads it published 
showed only whites, the Washington Post began requiring that blacks appear in 
25% of its ads. Avenel stopped advertising in the paper after the policy was 
put into practice, but it denied it did so to avoid using blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one of the most important areas of racism we have to deal 
with," Webbert said. "I don't think this is going to solve all the problems, 
but it's something that should not be this late in the game."

IMMUNITY CLAIMED FOR CAPTAIN IN OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Capt. Joseph Hazelwood reported that the Exxon Valdez was spilling crude 
oil into Prince William Sound, he automatically won immunity from prosecution 
on any charges from the spill, his lawyer claims. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanors and three felonies in the 
spill, but court documents filed in his defense claim that a little-known state 
regulation protects him from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation was designed to encourage reporting of spilled oil or other 
hazardous substances. The immunity clause provides that information obtained in 
such a report may not be used in prosecuting the people who make the 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's trial is tentatively set for Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Early on March 24, Hazelwood reported to the Coast Guard that his vessel was 
impaled on Bligh Reef and was spilling its cargo of oil into the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of some kind of immunity to "any natural person providing this 
notification or report" is stated in the Alaska Administrative Code, but it 
will be up to Superior Court Judge Beverly Cutler to decide how far the 
protection extends. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Madson, one of Hazelwood's attorneys, said the immunity clause "prohibits 
prosecution for anything stated by the reporter, as well as any information 
which is derived from investigating the report." 
</P>
<P>
If Cutler rules for Hazelwood, it could eliminate all of the evidence gathered 
by the state to support its charges against the former skipper. 
</P>
<P>
Madson argued that a broad interpretation of the immunity clause is necessary 
because people who spill oil are legally required to report the incident -- 
violating their right to protection from self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"The immunity offered is to ensure that, if one obeys the law by reporting a 
discharge, he cannot be criminally prosecuted for the discharge itself," Madson 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Ignored Laws 
</P>
<P>
Madson said also that the state improperly ignored laws specifically designed 
to deal with oil spills and charged Hazelwood instead with catchall criminal 
mischief felonies that carry stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Madson said the allegations of recklessness are based on untrue accusations. 
The state claims Hazelwood turned over control of the ship to a third mate who 
did not have a required license. Madson said the Coast Guard had waived that 
rule, although Coast Guard information appears to dispute Madson's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
The second allegation of recklessness is based on charges that Hazelwood tried 
to rock the tanker off the reef. But Madson said logs show the engine was not 
in reverse at any time after the grounding.

DRUG MONEY STING TAPED BY U.S. AGENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SOME DEPUTIES IN SKIMMING CASE SEEN HANDLING FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal agents, working a sting operation against nine Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department narcotics officers suspected of skimming drug money, last 
month videotaped some of the officers as they handled money seized during a 
narcotics raid, sources close to the investigation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how many members of the nine-officer narcotics team were 
videotaped, but all nine participated in the raid at a San Fernando Valley 
hotel, a sheriff's source said. The tape, sources said, is part of the evidence 
being used in an attempt to obtain indictments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Eight veteran deputies and their sergeant were relieved of duty last week when 
Sheriff Sherman Block and federal investigators announced that a probe begun 
last October had reportedly revealed money-skimming by at least some members of 
the drug unit, one of four assigned by the department to investigate "major" 
narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Pouch 
</P>
<P>
Sources who have reviewed a portion of the tape said it shows at least two 
officers taking cash from a money bag and putting it in a separate pouch. 
</P>
<P>
"The feds were using a sting and set these guys up," one source said. "They 
have at least one videotape, maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed in what Block described as potentially the 
biggest scandal of his seven-year tenure as head of the nation's largest 
sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department sources said Friday that federal investigators were 
relying on videotapes of the sting in an effort to obtain indictments. The U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles had no comment Friday on whether a tape had 
been shown to a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, an attorney for the union representing some of the suspended 
deputies, confirmed Friday that federal authorities had taped a sting operation 
in August and he had seen a portion of it. 
</P>
<P>
Shinee would not comment on how he came to see the tape, nor would he discuss 
its details, except to say the footage he saw is "inconclusive and does not 
demonstrate misconduct or any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
Shinee maintained that what is shown on the tape could be explained as 
legitimate money handling in a drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
"They take money in a drug raid," he said. "They preserve evidence. That's what 
they're there for." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the seized money is separated does not alone demonstrate 
criminality, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shinee would not identify the deputies shown on the videotape. A sheriff's 
source said the tape shows "a couple" of officers separating the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bag on Table 
</P>
<P>
The source, who said he saw a four-minute portion of a tape, said it showed "a 
bag sitting on a table in a room." 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys opened the bag, took some money out and then closed the bag," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The narcotics officers were surprised when confronted with the tape last week, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Sheriff's Department and federal officials have refused comment on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The officers have been suspended pending completion of federal and county 
probes. While they still receive pay, the officers have been forced to turn in 
their guns and badges. 
</P>
<P>
One federal law enforcement source has said that at least $200,000 might have 
been taken during the last year by members of the unit. There was no indication 
that narcotics were also stolen, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Lawler, FBI agent in charge of the Los Angeles office, has explained 
the suspensions by saying that some money seized in drug raids never made it to 
the evidence locker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officers Named 
</P>
<P>
The suspended officers are Sgt. Robert Sobel and Deputies Terrell H. Amers, 
James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. 
Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna. 
</P>
<P>
Shinee said he was unaware of any impending indictments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else they have, and I have no indications as to the timing 
of any (indictments)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, who is heading his office's review of 
the case, would not comment.

Confusion is mounting in Irwindale, and it doesn't only involve whether the 
Raiders are moving there. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Mexican flags were supposed to be hung in front of City Hall 
alongside triangular banners for the city fiesta honoring Mexico's independence 
days (Sept. 15-16). 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Hungarian flags were hung, instead. 
</P>
<P>
When he learned of the mix-up Friday, Vice Mayor Pat Miranda rushed down to 
City Hall with his wife to see what could be done. Nothing, it turned out, 
because offices in the San Gabriel Valley city were closed in honor of 
California's Admission Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they'll just stay up there until Monday," Miranda said from his car as 
he drove off. 
</P>
<P>
While the flag flap sounds as though it were scripted by Woody Allen, there was 
speculation that it resulted from a mix-up at the company hired to hang the 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
The flags of both countries feature green, red and white stripes. But Hungary's 
are horizontal, while Mexico's are vertical. The Mexican flag also has an 
eagle-and-serpent emblazoned across the middle. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, talking to a friend outside City Hall, looked at the positive side: 
"At least they got the colors right." 
</P>
<P>
History doesn't record whether the first celebrity residents of Beverly Hills, 
Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, inspired a youngster to stand out on 
Wilshire Boulevard with a sign that proclaimed: 
</P>
<P>
"Map to the Stars' Home." 
</P>
<P>
But, as more entertainment personalities took root there, the guide-hawking 
youngsters became more numerous, as did vendors of flowers and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Terming the proliferation a hazard in the face of mounting automobile traffic, 
the Beverly Hills City Council adopted an ordinance this week that bars vending 
on public streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too dangerous," Mayor Max Salter said. "I'm not unsympathetic 
because as a little kid during the Depression I used to hustle chocolate bars 
in New York, running in and out of traffic. But I still look back and wonder 
how I avoided getting crushed." 
</P>
<P>
A verbal spat between Little League managers turned into a fistfight at Sherman 
Oaks Park on Thursday night and, soon, parents were spilling out of the stands 
to join the fracas on the field. 
</P>
<P>
How do you control hyperactive adults? Simple. 
</P>
<P>
The groundskeeper turned on the sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
End of brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Great L.A. Moments: On this day in 1850, President Millard Fillmore signed a 
bill admitting California as the 31st state. There was no celebration that day 
in the sleepy little pueblo of L.A., however. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, because there was no telegraph or railroad connecting the town to the 
rest of the country, word of statehood didn't reach L.A. for several days. 
Perhaps that's when people first started saying that L.A. was in a world of its 
own.

There are more than 480,000 dogs in the city of Los Angeles, the Department of 
Animal Regulation estimates. From July, 1988, through June, 1989, the 
department licensed 200,000 dogs and 1,701 equine, 99% of them horses. As of 
August, the department recorded 2,224 horses, 11 burros and six mules in the 
city. Cats are not licensed and no firm population estimates exist.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRAWL BLAMED ON CAN OF SPRAY PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute over a can of spray paint may have ignited racial tensions and led to 
a brawl at the Fenner Canyon Youth Conservation Camp, resulting in 10 inmates 
being treated for injuries at hospitals in the Antelope Valley, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 32 inmates -- mostly Latinos and Asians -- who were involved in the 
Thursday night melee were transferred Friday to a maximum-security youth 
training facility in Chino, said Simon Cabrera, assistant superintendent at 
Fenner. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members rushed into a dormitory and used Mace to break up the fight, and 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called to the camp at Llano, east of 
Palmdale, to quell the disturbance. The inmates used mop handles, chairs and 
wooden clocks as weapons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera said the brawl was a "racial disturbance" that may have been rooted in 
an incident earlier this week when staff members searched the dorm for a 
missing can of spray paint, which inmates sniff. A Latino inmate who had the 
spray can apparently hid it under an Asian inmate's bunk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, operated by the California Youth Authority, provides crews to aid 
fire departments throughout the state. Those at the camp, including many gang 
members, were convicted in Juvenile Court of crimes such as car theft, burglary 
and drug offenses.

DEFENSIVE HELP ISN'T ON ITS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
SECONDARY HURTING FOR UCLA IN OPENER AGAINST TENNESSEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Williams has Terry Donahue over a barrel. A walk-on from Crenshaw High 
School, Williams is expected to start at cornerback tonight when UCLA plays 
Tennessee at the Rose Bowl in the Bruins' season opener. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected assignment could pay for Williams' education this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If Michael comes up and says he won't take a snap until he gets a scholarship, 
that is one demand that management will have to meet," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue can ill afford a holdout in his ravaged secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Injury, suspension and poor grades have taken six defensive backs out of the 
UCLA lineup: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free safety Willie Crawford and cornerback Damion Lyons have been suspended 
for the season. Both were listed No. 2 on the depth chart, but Crawford was 
expected to make a strong push for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strong safety Anthony Burnett, also listed No. 2 on the depth chart, was 
declared academically ineligible last month and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free safety Eric Nelson, who became No. 2 on the depth chart in Crawford's 
absence, underwent reconstructive surgery on his right knee, injured last 
month, and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strong safety Patrick Bates, a highly regarded freshman, has a strained 
knee and is not expected to suit up tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Randy Beverly, the only one of the six projected to be a 
starter, broke the big toe on his right foot last week and is listed as 
doubtful for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 5-foot-9, 159-pound freshman, is expected to replace Beverly in the 
starting lineup against a Tennessee team that, according to Donahue, "has as 
much wide-receiver speed as we'll see at any time this year." 
</P>
<P>
The precarious situation in the secondary has left the Bruins "more stressed 
and strung out maybe than we ordinarily would be," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
So much so, in fact, that the UCLA coach seems almost unconcerned that his 
sixth-ranked team will open the season with a starting quarterback who has yet 
to take a snap in a college game. That would be Bret Johnson, a freshman who 
will lead an otherwise experienced unit that includes seven returning starters, 
four of whom are linemen. 
</P>
<P>
An eighth returning starter, tight end Charles Arbuckle, is listed as doubtful 
because of an ankle injury, but the Bruins are probably as deep at tight end as 
any team in the country. Corwin Anthony is expected to start in Arbuckle's 
place, as he did five times last season, and backup Randy Austin also is highly 
regarded. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can let our quarterback grow and develop slowly and not put undue 
pressure and demands on him," Donahue said. "But that doesn't mean he's not 
going to be a featured performer. 
</P>
<P>
"If you play quarterback at UCLA, you're going to be involved in the offense 
and you're going to be a featured performer. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, won't be as conspicuous as, say, Troy Aikman was last season. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows that, including Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors, who said of the 
Bruins this week: "I wouldn't be surprised to see them try to run the ball 
right down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the running will be done by tailbacks Brian Brown and Shawn Wills, 
which says a lot about UCLA's depth at that position. Two years ago, Kevin 
Williams was considered the No. 1 high school running back in the country, but 
the redshirt freshman is clearly behind the more experienced Brown and Wills in 
his development, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, at least, the Bruins seem to be fairly well set. 
</P>
<P>
But they are looking for volunteers to stop the Volunteers, who opened their 
season last week with a 17-14 victory over Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, which lost its first six games last season, has since won six in a 
row. . . . Against Colorado State last week, running back Reggie Cobb ran for 
98 yards and a touchdown in 16 carries. Cobb ran for 1,197 yards and 17 
touchdowns two years ago as a freshman but injuries last season limited the 
6-foot, 210-pound junior to 547 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 55,000 is expected. A free shuttle bus will transport fans to 
the Rose Bowl from a parking lot just west of Fair Oaks Avenue between Holly 
and Walnut streets in Pasadena. . . . UCLA is listed as a 15-point favorite.

JEWELRY SHOP ROBBERS' BULLET SMACKS WALL OF NEARBY BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Dorich said he had just left his desk at the Union Bank where he works in 
Brentwood on Friday when the bullet came crashing through the window directly 
above where he'd been sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd still been sitting there it would have passed a foot from my head," the 
30-year-old commercial-loan officer said Friday afternoon. "I'd have had a 
heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a pair of armed robbers fired into the bank on San Vicente 
Boulevard as they attempted to shoot a man who chased them after they held up a 
small jewelry store nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet missed the man, the busy traffic on San Vicente, Dorich, the several 
customers in the bank lobby and a line of tellers behind a counter before it 
struck a paneled wall and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Forced Inside 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rosen, 40, owner of the jewelry store that bears his name, said the two 
men forced his wife inside the store about 11:30 a.m., smashed a glass case and 
scooped up a handful of watches. 
</P>
<P>
"They took the gold-plated ones -- the good ones they left," Rosen said. "I 
kept asking myself, 'Why is all that traffic out there?' You see, I had a .44 
special by my hand, but I couldn't use it because I might hurt someone out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen said the robbers dashed outside and jumped into a car parked in front of 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
"As they took off, a guy outside saw what they were doing and gave chase," 
Rosen said. "They pulled into the parking lot, and he pulled in behind them. 
One of them turned around and fired that shot, the one that went into the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"They took off, and that was enough for him," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the stolen watches was not immediately determined.

EX-AGENT GETS TERM IN LUXEMBOURG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fugitive former narcotics agent Darnell Garcia, indicted in Los Angeles on 
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges, has been sentenced to six months 
in prison in Luxembourg for traveling on a false passport, it was learned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One of Garcia's attorneys, Mark A. Borenstein of Los Angeles, said the 
sentencing by a three-judge tribunal Thursday means that the U.S. government's 
attempt to extradite Garcia to stand trial in Los Angeles cannot take place 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It could take a year or more before extradition proceedings are completed," 
Borenstein said in a telephone interview from Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, most recently expanded last week, alleges that Garcia and two 
other former Drug Enforcement Administration agents, all of whom worked in the 
agency's Los Angeles office, conspired to traffic in cocaine and heroin and 
laundered their profits through banks in Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Separately Friday, an alleged cocaine kingpin whose brother had alleged links 
to Garcia was arrested in the San Bernardino County community of Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney P. Browning, 29, was arrested without incident in a pickup truck by a 
task force of eight deputy U.S. marshals and local and county law enforcement 
officers, said David Stanton, the chief deputy U.S. marshal for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"A considerable amount of cash, drugs and weapons was in Browning's (Rialto) 
residence," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney Browning is a known member of the street gang known as the Black 
Guerrilla Family and is reported to be a major supplier of cocaine and crack to 
the Bloods and Crips street gangs in Los Angeles," the marshal's office said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, one of the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 most wanted fugitives, along 
with his older brother, Elrader Browning Jr., headed a network that supplied 
cocaine to cities in Southern California and other parts of the country, 
according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Life Sentences 
</P>
<P>
Elrader Browning was charged in 1987 with netting an estimated $2.5 million a 
month from drug trafficking. He was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive 
life prison terms without the possibility of parole and fined $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the charges contained in the 42-count Garcia indictment alleges that 
Garcia leaked intelligence information through another alleged drug trafficker, 
Ron Waddy, to Elrader Browning in June, 1987, when Browning was about to be 
arrested by federal agents in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Waddy and his brother, Conway Willie Waddy Jr., are facing trial in Detroit. 
Ron Waddy was arrested in July in Paris where he was on the lam with Garcia, 
federal authorities allege. His scheduled extradition hearing is set for Sept. 
27 in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's extradition proceedings, to transport him for trial from Luxembourg to 
Los Angeles, is being handled by the State and Justice departments. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman, David Denny, said the agency's lawyers "would 
have to consult the (extradition) treaty" between Washington and Luxembourg to 
determine whether Garcia's six-month sentence on the passport violation could 
snag the extradition process. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to stand trial with Garcia, 42, of Rancho Palos Verdes, are two other 
former Drug Enforcement Administration agents, John Jackson, 40, of Claremont, 
and Wayne Countryman, 46, of Walnut; Jackson's wife, Barbara, 41, and Jackson's 
former business partner, Sherman Lair, 39, of Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heroin Worth $7.5 Million 
</P>
<P>
The DEA corruption investigation being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office 
in Los Angeles turns partly on the suspected theft in the 1980s of more than 
five pounds of Asian heroin with a street value of $7.5 million from the 
custody of the DEA here. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia had been a fugitive for seven months, apparently traveling on a bogus 
Mexican passport until his arrest in early July by Luxembourg police, who got a 
tip from DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
The trial had been scheduled Nov. 7 before U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in 
Los Angeles. But that date was recently canceled, and no new one has been set. 
</P>
<P>
The chief prosecutor in the Garcia case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Karlin, 
said she did not know whether Garcia's six-month sentence in Luxembourg would 
substantially delay the extradition proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But, in any case, Karlin said Friday that she will oppose Garcia's trial being 
handled separately from the other defendants.

DISABLED ROCK SINGER TAKES ON TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorik Perman is a rock-and-roll entertainer. He's got cool shades, weird 
clothes, a briefcase full of his own music, a fancy stage show and a foxy 
backup who is also his real-live nurse. He's also got a wheelchair, and he's 
got a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair is a necessity because Perman is a paraplegic, disabled since 
childhood with muscular dystrophy. The problem, he said, is getting a booking 
at the Troubadour, one of the Sunset Strip's legendary rock-and-roll clubs. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of musicians have trouble getting bookings at a lot of clubs, especially 
new talent. But Perman, 34, has filed a complaint with the state Department of 
Fair Employment and Housing, charging that the Troubadour has refused to book 
him because of his handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they'd heard I had a following of 50 wheelchair groupies coming 
to watch me perform and they couldn't have that stampede," said Perman. 
</P>
<P>
Troubadour officials deny that they discriminated against Perman. Instead, they 
said the refusal was based on his ability, or inability, to draw an audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Following 
</P>
<P>
"He does not have a following, and those who don't, we don't book. That's just 
business," said Gina Barsamian, who is in charge of bookings for the club. She 
said that the booking agent who talked to Perman no longer works for them. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "We are not equipped for wheelchairs on our stage. There's no 
ramp and by the time you get the music equipment on stage, there is not room 
for a wheelchair. This would be for his own safety, too." 
</P>
<P>
Perman, who has received good reviews from rock critics as a newcomer, has 
played other local clubs -- the Roxy, Gazzarri's, Club Lingerie, FM Station, 
Coconut Teaszer -- with little problem. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he warned in a half-page advertisement he took out in the monthly 
magazine In Concert: 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Troubadour) are (messing) with the wrong disabled dude." 
</P>
<P>
Perman said the booking agent made the "discriminatory" remark to him after his 
audition several months ago: "I called back and told them to check with other 
clubs, that I don't bring in a lot of audience in wheelchairs, and even if I 
did, so what? 
</P>
<P>
Only then, he alleges, did the club management change its tune. He was told a 
check had been made with another club and it revealed he couldn't draw a large 
audience. "I told them to call some others, because I did have a bad audience 
in that particular instance because I was playing the midnight spot at the end 
of a three-day weekend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Booked Up' 
</P>
<P>
Then he called back and got another story, he said. "This time it was, 'We're 
booked up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Steve White, a senior consultant with the state Department of Fair Employment 
and Housing, said that the agency has received the complaint. Officials have 
not yet interviewed Perman about his charges, the first step in the complaint 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other local clubs said they have had no qualms booking the 
wheelchair-bound musician. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no problems the several times we have played him," said Bill 
Gazzarri, owner of Gazzarri's. "We just got him up on stage and let him 
perform." He added, he could not remember the size of the audiences. 
</P>
<P>
A former free-lance writer from San Francisco, Perman started playing keyboards 
and synthesizers as physical therapy for his hands, of which he has limited 
use. One thing led to another, and soon he was writing music, making tapes. 
</P>
<P>
His practical nurse Debra Dae, who had played guitar off and on all her life, 
accompanied him. Friends told them they were good enough to go professional, so 
they developed a Las Vegas-like act, in which they have props and wear costumes 
to correspond with the songs. 
</P>
<P>
Perman acknowledges that there is some publicity value in his disability. And 
sometimes Dae dresses in a version of her professional attire, a short nurse's 
outfit with spike heels. But, he said, there are limits on how far he will go 
to capitalize on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
One producer suggested that Perman dress up his wheelchair. Someone else 
suggested he write a "wheelchair rap." 
</P>
<P>
"That would be too much like a sideshow," he said. "I figure I'm doing some 
trailblazing and I want to be judged by my music, to show people that handicaps 
aren't necessarily handicaps."

Oxford and Cambridge University presses have taken the usual task of Bible 
publishing a step further. 
</P>
<P>
The joint publishers of the Revised English Bible, an updated version of the 
20-year-old New English Bible, have translated the spirit of the texts into 
action by giving a percentage of the profits to contemporary charities that 
feed the poor, house the homeless and comfort the sick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Strategy 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide introduction of the Bible will be accompanied by a marketing 
strategy tagged the REB Charity Program that will donate 50 cents for each 
Bible purchased to one of six charities indicated on a card found within each 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
In its various formats and editions, copies of the Bible range in price from 
$19.95 to $50. Purchasers can simply drop the card into the mail if they 
purchase one of the Bibles before Jan. 31, 1990, when the charity program ends. 
</P>
<P>
"We took Matthew 25:35-36 ('For when I was hungry, you gave me food') and we 
tried to translate that into modern terms, into issues that confront people 
daily," said David Perkins, head of Oxford's Bible division advertising and 
promotion department. 
</P>
<P>
If the 150,000 first printing sells out by Jan. 31, that could mean up to 
$75,000 will be shared among Prison Fellowship Ministries; Habitat for 
Humanity, International; AIDS National Interfaith Network; Reading Is 
Fundamental; Save the Children, and Food for the Hungry Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The original New English Bible was hailed by scholars and general readers alike 
when it was published in 1970. It was a best seller for months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Biblical Scholarship 
</P>
<P>
The Revised English Bible is a verse-by-verse review and update of the Greek 
and Aramaic texts by a committee of British scholars in light of the latest 
biblical scholarship. The scholars then passed on their efforts to a group of 
distinguished writers and poets who read the translations with an ear for the 
music of the language and passed back their suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bibles were commissioned by a multidenominational committee of religious 
leaders representing the major Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in 
Britain, Scotland and Ireland.

ACADEMICIANS WILL TRY TO PROVE SHROUD OF TURIN IS NOT A FAKE 
</P>

<P>
A group of academicians say they will try to prove that the controversial Turin 
shroud, which many Christians have believe bears the imprint of Christ's body, 
is not a medieval fake. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people attended a two-day conference late this week in Paris, the 
first since the Roman Catholic Church announced last October that carbon-dating 
tests proved the cloth was a clever forgery from the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The findings seemed to rule out the possibility that the shroud, which bears 
the bloodstained image of a bearded man, was used to wrap Christ's body. 
</P>
<P>
But some scholars, convinced that more can be learned about the yellowing cloth 
in Turin Cathedral since 1587, are determined that the matter should not stop 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Marie-Claire Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, a Belgian expert on carbon-dating, 
criticized the way the so-called carbon-14 tests were carried out. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Tite of the British Museum, who coordinated the research in the 
United States, England and Switzerland and was the only carbon-14 
representative in Paris, dismissed the doubters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt in the accuracy of the tests. But there's no scientific 
argument against peoples' faith," Tite added.

BUSH DRUG STRATEGY FALLS SHORT IN SOME WAYS, RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's drug control strategy is eliciting some positive feedback from 
the religious community, but several religious leaders contacted after the 
President's speech criticized the program for devoting too little to drug 
prevention and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the country's "outrage against drugs" and promising "an assault on every 
front," Bush presented a drug-control strategy over national television Tuesday 
that allocates nearly 70% of a $7.9-billion outlay toward law enforcement and 
the remainder to prevention and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Several religious leaders interviewed said that while enforcement efforts 
against drug traffickers and users is necessary, the President's plan puts 
disappointingly little emphasis on stemming the demand for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Things in Plan' 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sider, executive director of Evangelicals for Social Action, said there are 
"a lot of good things" in the plan, such as suggestions for tougher penalties 
for drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still think there's too much emphasis on limiting supply rather than 
reducing demand," Sider said. He said there should be more resources allocated 
for drug education efforts and to rehabilitation of drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bohlen, director of the substance abuse program for the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of New York, said she was "a little bit disappointed that the 
emphasis was so heavily on law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a coordinated effort to fight the supply side and demand 
side," Bohlen said. "If you continue to have the demand side going up, you have 
exactly what you have today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education Need Cited 
</P>
<P>
Like Sider, Bohlen acknowledged the need for strong law enforcement efforts but 
suggested that more emphasis be put on education programs such as those 
operated by the New York Archdiocese, which sponsors 12 regional substance 
abuse offices. 
</P>
<P>
Among the archdiocese's programs are counselor training classes for adults from 
a broad cross section of community groups and peer ministry programs in which 
high school students are trained to bring the anti-drug message to other young 
people in their parishes. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Patrick L. Williams, pastor of the Crest-Moore-King United Methodist 
Church in Dallas, who is heading up a regional effort that encourages churches 
to establish drug-free zones, said the President's strategy "falls far short of 
where we need to be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Centers Needed 
</P>
<P>
Williams said there is a need for more drug treatment centers "directly in the 
communities" and for education programs that improve the "self-image and 
self-esteem" of inner-city youth. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Bush appeared to stop just short of proposing a strategy that 
would amount simply to increasing the number of judges and jails. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not really the answer, incarcerating people," said Williams. Citing a 
need for an "aggressive" approach to stem not only drug supplies but drug 
demand, Williams said he did not think the President's program does that. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Billy A. Melvin, executive director of the National Assn. of 
Evangelicals, had the most positive response to Bush's drug strategy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism Inevitable 
</P>
<P>
Melvin said the President "is to be commended for addressing a very critical 
issue in our country." He maintained that Bush was bound to be criticized no 
matter how he planned to allocate the $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Evangelicals official acknowledged that drug use 
"permeates our society, and the church community is not segregated from the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Homes of people within the church have been uprooted by drugs," Melvin said. 
"They (the churches) are all dealing with people who are caught up in drugs -- 
you can't avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Cooper, acting director of the National Council of Churches' Washington 
office, welcomed the President's "expressions of profound concern" about the 
drug crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crack Cocaine Threat 
</P>
<P>
She noted that drug abuse, particularly that involving crack cocaine, has been 
an issue of great concern to the National Council. She pointed to a May 
resolution by the agency's Governing Board calling on churches to educate 
members about crack cocaine and urging the government to provide adequate 
funding to address problems of demand and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper also noted that the council's Division of Church and Society 
co-sponsored a crack cocaine conference in San Francisco last spring which 
resulted in creation of a national network of religious leaders dedicated to 
fighting crack.

ORTHODOX PRELATE CONCERNED OVER USE OF ENGLISH 
</P>

<P>
The growing use of English as a primary or exclusive language among Orthodox 
Christians in the United States has drawn concern from a ranking prelate 
recently, but some clerics believe the trend is inevitable, even beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Iakovos, primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and 
South America, has warned that Greek-Americans are cutting "ourselves off from 
our historic past" by not drilling their children in the fundamentals of Greek. 
</P>
<P>
But on the positive side, the shift from ethnic languages such as Serbian or 
Ukrainian to English means that one of the most critical divisions of the 
ethnic churches is evaporating, opening the door to a united American Orthodox 
denomination using English. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, that's the future of Orthodoxy in the United States," said Slavco 
Taskov of New York, former vice president of the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox 
Church. "Since English is the vehicle of communication here, it has to become 
the primary language of the church." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Isaiah of New York, chancellor of the Greek archdiocese, said his church 
considers the Greek language to be an inextricable link to that country's faith 
and culture. Therefore, he said, "Archbishop Iakovos is trying to tell the 
people in a positive way to perpetuate what was nearly taken away from us in 
bygone days." 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 1 letter to the faithful marking the start of a new school year, 
Archbishop Iakovos referred to the 400-year rule of Greece by the Ottoman 
Empire, when Turkish was the official language. He charged that to abandon 
Greek now "would be ingratitude on our part, as well as shameful and a callous 
disregard of history." 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a stage of transition," said Father John Yurcisin of Johnstown, Pa., 
chancellor of the Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Diocese in America.

FAMILY LIFE: WHY WON'T JOHNNY LEARN? LOOK IN THE MIRROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If H.G. Wells was right and civilization is a race between education and 
catastrophe, we'd all better jump out and buy some good running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, catastrophe is a few laps ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Just look at the figures. Adult illiteracy running at a 20% rate, school 
dropouts running between 25% and 70%, depending on the location. Then we have 
the college students whose knowledge of geography is about as good as my cat's 
and the skilled jobs that go unfilled because applicants can't understand 
simple printed instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Something's wrong here. Make that plural. There are a lot of things wrong in 
our society, and in the end it's the kids who pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just the children of the homeless whose futures are at stake. 
Those college students who can't distinguish Iowa from Italy didn't come off 
the streets. They come from some of the nation's most affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is we live in an incredibly ignorant society -- not stupid, mind you, 
not unable to learn, just unlearned. 
</P>
<P>
So, who's to blame? And how do we fix it? 
</P>
<P>
We might start by looking in the mirror for some answers. 
</P>
<P>
One simple start was recently discussed by Joan Abrahamson, 37, who in 1985 won 
a MacArthur Foundation fellowship -- often referred to as a "genius grant" -- 
for creating the Los Angeles-based think tank, the Jefferson Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Washington meeting on illiteracy, she told of watching her very 
young son -- too young to read -- flipping through a Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered why he did that," she said, "and I realized he's just watching us. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have reading material in the home, the child doesn't develop that 
kind of curiosity." 
</P>
<P>
You might think it doesn't take a genius to figure that out, but the fact is 
millions of American homes don't contain books, magazines or newspapers (one 
poll recently showed that 45% of the people in Orange County read no newspaper 
at all). 
</P>
<P>
And many of those people are college-educated. About them, James Lehrer of the 
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" had these words while speaking recently at Southern 
Methodist University in Dallas: 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the dumbest people I know went to great, prestigious colleges and 
universities. . . . They (got their diplomas and) pronounced themselves 
well-educated . . . and proceeded to never read another book, entertain another 
fresh idea or tax their minds in any way beyond what was minimally required to 
make a living or make it socially, or both." 
</P>
<P>
Most of us recognize our children's need for emotional nurturing, but too many 
of us go on to neglect their need for intellectual nurturing. 
</P>
<P>
If we want them educated, we must want to be educated ourselves, develop what 
Lehrer called a "lifelong hunger for more -- more ideas, more information, more 
good thoughts, more challenges." 
</P>
<P>
And we must be involved in their educational lives, both in school and at home. 
</P>
<P>
We recently asked readers to give some of their thoughts on how involved we 
should be. One of the more impressive responses came from Kathy Brown, a mother 
of five who lives in San Juan Capistrano. Following are some excerpts from her 
letter: 
</P>
<P>
"As a parent, you are your child's first teacher. What an opportunity that is! 
What a challenge! 
</P>
<P>
"That is not to say . . . the schools are unimportant -- they are critical, but 
it is up to us as their primary teachers to provide the example that will help 
shape the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"One of (my) most rewarding activities is reading with my children in the 
evening. I believe that this the door to lifelong love of reading. 
</P>
<P>
"We cuddle on the bed and read for up to an hour . . . one of our special times 
together. As the children get older, they read to me as well, a practice that 
increases their reading capabilities phenomenally. 
</P>
<P>
"(As a result), my older children are excellent readers, have wonderful writing 
skills and excellent vocabularies . . . and continue to enjoy reading 
recreationally. 
</P>
<P>
"Trips to the zoo, Sea World, the San Diego Wild Animal Park, county fairs, 
parks, tide pools, et cetera, are also stimulating learning experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"As your child moves from your domain into preschool, kindergarten, then on to 
elementary, secondary and high school, the parent's role begins to change. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the parent to be (aware of) programs offered in those 
schools . . . and to develop good communication with the teacher. You must be 
aware of any homework that has been assigned and make sure those assignments 
are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"While some children readily take on the responsibility for themselves, others 
need supervision until they learn to be more responsible. As for actually 
assisting your child with the homework, I believe it is important to explain 
concepts, but equally important that completion of the homework be the child's. 
</P>
<P>
"As the child grows more confident in handling these things himself, your 
assistance will not be needed as often, (but) your child's teacher needs your 
reinforcement at home. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my observation," she writes, "that the majority of high achievers in 
school have parents who are very involved in their education." 
</P>
<P>
And that's the point.

DISCOVERY: WILLELLA HOWE-WAFFLE HOME AND CARRIAGE HOUSE

The Willella Howe-Waffle House in downtown Santa Ana has defied the odds for 
sheer existence as it celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. Its survival 
was neither likely nor probable: It took several stays of demolition by the 
wrecker's ball, fund-raisers, even a banner nailed to the house pleading for 
foundation funds before preservationists won over condominium developers in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The Howe-Waffle House, considered at the turn of the century one of Santa Ana's 
showplaces, was built by Dr. Alvin Jared Howe, Santa Ana's second mayor, and 
his wife, Willella Earhart, one of Orange County's first woman physicians. The 
building, originally situated on the northwest corner of Bush and Seventh 
streets, was threatened by the street-widening project of 
</P>
<P>
Civic Center Drive 
</P>
<P>
and after numerous negotiations with City Hall was moved to its current 
location at the southeast corner of Civic Center Drive and Sycamore Street 
during March, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of this two-story gingerbread house, with its multigabled roof 
and turret tower, became a passion for Santa Ana resident Adeline Walker, who 
died in 1985 just before the project's completion. In the mid-1970s, the house 
"was in a state of disrepair," says Scott Morgan, chief executive assistant to 
Supervisor Roger Stanton. Walker, working with other volunteers, personally 
stripped away wallpaper (once discovering a covered window), stripped paint 
from the wood, even single-handedly planted a jacaranda tree in the yard, then 
furnished the house as it might have looked at the time of Dr. Howe-Waffle's 
death in 1924. (The Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society was founded at 
Walker's instigation and currently has 200 members.) 
</P>
<P>
The house displays its original California redwood throughout its 12 rooms. At 
the entrance, the main staircase to the second story is made of beautifully 
carved wood. Lace curtains, in the style of the early '20s, border the bay 
windows. Dried flowers accent the rooms throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
The rugs in the parlor and family parlor room are bordered with a rose pattern 
that was a particular favorite of Dr. Willella's, displaying Walker's 
painstaking research; the revolving bookcase, in the family parlor, was 
returned by the family to complete the Howe-Waffle museum. Walls are covered 
with wallpaper popular in the 1910s and the '20s. The so-called Wisteria Room, 
named after its wallpaper pattern, holds an original washstand and dresser. 
</P>
<P>
The fireplace in the 
</P>
<P>
dining room has also been 
</P>
<P>
there since the turn of the 
</P>
<P>
century; the table is covered with a lace tablecloth. The kitchen retains its 
1910 kitchen stove and a single-burner alcohol stove; the linoleum is a 
reproduction of a 1904 pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"It took (10 years) till about 1985 to get it in 
</P>
<P>
the shape it's in now," Morgan says. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society's early hope to develop a small 
medical museum containing suitable medical equipmentto honor the pioneer 
physician was scratched. The doctor's medical instruments, including items 
labeled "forceps for delivering babies" and "needles and cat gut" appear in 
display cases or hang framed on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The house's wraparound veranda is original; the gazebo, replacing what was once 
an aviary, was built by Max Becker, another member of the preservation society. 
The carriage house boasts three carriages such as those Dr. Howe-Waffle may 
have used to make house calls. (In earlier years she visited sick patients by 
horse and buggy.) Becker and Royal Spurrier, another society member, "have 
spent thousands of hours doing repair work, often six to eight hours every 
weekend," Morgan says. "It's all been a community effort." 
</P>
<P>
Diann Marsh, an active member of the Historical Preservation Society and a 
resident of Santa Ana's French Park district, remembers Walker as having been 
very protective toward the house, wary of guests or visitors. The house's 
restoration was her mission in the last decade of her life. Today Marsh says 
the home deserves a wide viewership; she "would like to share it with others." 
</P>
<P>
(Addendum: The marriage of Alvin and Willella led to divorce, after which Dr. 
Willella married Edwin D. Waffle, owner of a livery business. The prejudice 
that greeted a woman doctor in Orange County in the 19th Century was "as 
relentless as an Apache Indian," Dr. Howe-Waffle is quoted as saying. But after 
she established her reputation, she is said to have delivered half the babies, 
known later as "Waffle babies," born in Santa Ana's growing population at the 
turn of the century.)

ASK THE JUDGE: MAN WHOSE BROTHER GAVE HIS NAME TO POLICE HAS A LEGAL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Q: My older brother has received a lot of traffic tickets that he has just 
ignored. Not surprisingly, they have all gone to warrant. It now turns out that 
he has been giving the police my name, so all the warrants for arrest are for 
me! What do I do? 
</P>
<P>
J.Y., 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: You should take care of this problem as soon as possible. The tickets 
normally have a physical description of the traffic violator on them. I would 
hope that your brother and you differ in the colors of your eyes or hair or in 
your height or weight. If you do not, you should be prepared to prove to the 
judge or commissioner that the tickets are not yours. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge or commissioner believes you, you may request a copy of the 
court's record or a letter stating that you are not the person wanted on the 
tickets. You should carry this paper with you so that if you are stopped, you 
can show it to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
You should be prepared to give your brother's name, date of birth, and address 
to the court. The tickets will then be amended to show his name, and the 
warrants will be then be re-issued for him. You should not feel guilty about 
providing this information, since your brother had no qualms about giving your 
name and exposing you to the possibility of being arrested and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I hired a contractor for some remodeling on my house. The contractor, in 
turn, hired some subcontractors to perform the job. Before any work was done, I 
paid the contractor a hefty deposit, which he said was necessary to pay the 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
To make a long story short, the contractor has disappeared, and the 
subcontractors are now claiming they were never paid for their work. They are 
threatening to put a lien on my property. 
</P>
<P>
Can they do this? It doesn't seem fair that they can get me when it was the 
contractor who cheated them. 
</P>
<P>
O.G., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A: A subcontractor is entitled to place what is known as a mechanic's lien on 
property for which he has provided labor or materials. The subcontractor may do 
this even if the owner of the property paid the contractor and it is the 
contractor who has failed to pay the subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractor must comply with specific requirements regarding notice to 
the owner in order for the lien to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
If the subcontractor does record a mechanic's lien on your property, your 
remedy would be to sue the contractor and his bonding company, if there is one. 
The law is such that even though the owner may be innocent of any wrongdoing, 
he has received value from the subcontractor, who is therefore entitled to be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My girlfriend absolutely will not use a seat belt when she is riding in my 
car. I keep telling her that I could get a ticket for this, but she refuses to 
believe me. Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
J.K., 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: The driver of a car can receive a ticket if his passenger is not wearing a 
seat belt. The maximum fine for a first offense is $22. For a further offense, 
it increases to $55. 
</P>
<P>
You would have a defense if your girlfriend suffers from a medical or physical 
disability that prevents her wearing a belt. She must, however, be able to 
prove it.

PHOTOGRAPHY: FAST LENS, GOOD FILM HELP KEEP UP WITH TODAY'S SURFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Brouillet does what most everyone would like to do when it's time to go 
to work -- he heads for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Brouillet is a senior staff photographer for Surfing Magazine and photo editor 
of Body Boarding Magazine, both published by Western Empire Publications in San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Brouillet, who was reared in Southern California, started surfing in the early 
1960s when the sport was gaining in popularity. But he didn't get interested in 
photography until he needed two units of credit to graduate from Cal State Long 
Beach (where he had enrolled mainly because it offered a surfing class). 
</P>
<P>
The class developed Brouillet's interest in photography, and he landed a job as 
a lab assistant at the surfing publication. Eventually, he worked his way up to 
staff photographer. He also returned to Cal State Long Beach, where he received 
his master's degree in photography. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's surfers are faster, and the moves are much more radical," Brouillet, 
40, of Huntington Beach, said. "It's been an evolution. The surfers are getting 
better, and their equipment has improved, so they can make tighter turns 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also a different mentality. In the old days, we had the Endless Summer, 
where everyone was out looking for the perfect wave with their long boards. The 
kids today don't want to travel too much. They want to go out in their own back 
yard with boards which are so much more maneuverable." 
</P>
<P>
The photography aspect has also changed. The standard for surfing photographers 
has become Kodachrome 64 film. A shutter speed of 1/500 and fast lens allows 
you to catch the peak moments of the ride. Of course, you still have to contend 
with the weather and tides. 
</P>
<P>
Another major need is clear, clean water -- difficult to find in Southern 
California. And if the sun isn't out, just pack up your gear and join the 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Brouillet recently spent two weeks in Hawaii, and it rained every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't shoot one roll of film of surfing the whole time I was there," he 
said. "The magazine realizes it's just the nature of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Professional surf photographers mostly use a 600-millimeter (f/4) or an 800-mm. 
(f/5.6) lens to get most of the action. Brouillet, however, says amateurs can 
get by with 200-mm. or 300-mm. lenses. 
</P>
<P>
An understanding of the sport is also a must. He says magazines are always 
looking for personality and life-style shots even though most of the pictures 
are action oriented. 
</P>
<P>
Brouillet does recommend some locations in Orange County to start your surfing 
picture collection: 
</P>
<P>
* The south side of the Seal Beach pier. It has some of the best waves on the 
coast that break very close to the beach. You can shoot it from the beach with 
a 300-mm. lens or longer. The disadvantage is the runoff from the river on the 
north end of town. During the winter, the water is very muddy. 
</P>
<P>
* The north side of the Huntington Beach pier. It was a photographer's paradise 
when the pier was open. There are usually good surfers in the water. When the 
pier reopens, lenses of 200-mm. and longer are advisable. 
</P>
<P>
* Newport Beach at 54th or 56th streets. It's possible to shoot with shorter 
Telephoto lenses from the jetties. A lot of the photography is shot with a 
300-mm. lens. 
</P>
<P>
* The Wedge at Newport Beach. During the summer when the waves are big you can 
shoot body boarders at the Wedge. The beach is front-lit in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
* Salt Creek by the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point. You need a 600-mm. or 
longer. This site is not recommended for the shooter with short Telephoto 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
* San Clemente north of the pier. A short Telephoto lens can do the trick here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Photography Column, which runs Saturdays in Orange County Life, is intended 
to help the serious amateur and weekend shooter. Questions and ideas are 
encouraged. Write to: Robert Lachman, Photography Department, The Times, 1375 
Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif., 92626.

COUNTY'S FIRST GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of protests from some fundamentalist Christians, Orange County's 
first gay pride festival is set to open today at Centennial Regional Park in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day festival is the first major organized gay celebration in a county 
known for its conservativism, and national gay activists and opponents of 
homosexuality alike have stated they will monitor the event. Opponents say 300 
persons will march today along the park's boundaries to protest the event. 
</P>
<P>
The festival itself will be a modest production compared to other gay pride 
festivals in West Hollywood and San Francisco, which feature hundreds of booths 
and dozens of stages. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, simplicity is the key word. The festival will be one-fifth 
the scale of the one in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a "generic" celebration, said Janet Avery, president of Orange 
County Cultural Pride, the nonprofit group organizing the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no glitz or glamour," Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, organizers began setting up about 50 booths from a variety of 
organizations, including the Gay Democrats of Orange County and the Republican 
Log Cabin club, in the 87-acre park's multipurpose field. A chain-link fence 
has been put up to border the festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers have pitched a 40-by-70-foot tent to house Art Expo, a display of 
more than 100 works of art by 20 artists that range from simple sketches of a 
pickup truck to landscape oil paintings. The Art Expo is the festival's largest 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor cafe has been built in the center of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Music and comedy will be performed both days on a main stage in the corner of 
the site. Festival hours will be 10 a.m. to 11 p.m today and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Sunday. Admission is $10. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's main draw is expected to be a parade Sunday in which more than 
60 participants, including Orange County's chapter of Parents and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays, will march a mile around the park's lake. 
</P>
<P>
The theme, like that at many other gay pride celebrations this year, is 
"Stonewall 20: A Generation of Pride," marking the 20th anniversary of the 
birth of the gay movement in New York City. In 1969, a police raid on a gay bar 
called the Stonewall provoked a three-day riot, increasing awareness of 
homosexual rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, organizers have also adopted the slogan "Orange County Comes 
Out." A pink triangle inside an orange is the symbol of the event. Organizers 
adopted the pink triangle because homosexuals were forced to wear pink 
triangles in Nazi concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the festival will be about $65,000 and will be covered by donations 
and fund-raisers, Avery said. About $15,000 of the money already has gone to 
Santa Ana for a security bond. 
</P>
<P>
Despite contentions from opponents that the festival would present a "clear and 
present danger" to the community because of the number of people it would 
attract, Santa Ana police said they do not foresee problems. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert Helton said the police are prepared to handle crowds as large 
as the 10,000 predicted by organizers. 
</P>
<P>
The park will also be patrolled by county park rangers and security guards, 
Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of an Anaheim-based lobbying group called the 
Traditional Values Coalition and the festival's staunchest opponent, said he 
expects more than 300 protesters to turn out Saturday. The counterdemonstration 
will be held on sidewalks of Edinger and Fairview streets bordering the park. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing peaceful demonstrations on the sidewalk for the heterosexual 
ethic," Sheldon said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said his protest will be held Saturday, but not Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to desecrate the Lord's day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said his supporters are continuing their effort to recall six of the 
seven Santa Ana City Council members who refused to sign a statement promising 
to ban the gay pride festival.

MAN KILLED IN SHOOT-OUT AFTER OFFICER IS WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Placentia police officer was shot and wounded outside a bar by a woman's 
outraged boyfriend, who was later cornered by police and killed in a gun battle 
on a gravel vacant lot, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old officer, a five-year veteran whose name was being withheld by 
authorities, was in stable condition at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana 
after three hours of surgery for an abdominal wound. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Buena Park man suspected of shooting the officer late Thursday 
night at The Railroad Inn was killed after a half-hour standoff with more than 
a dozen officers from the Placentia and Anaheim police departments in a vacant 
lot at Van Buren Street and Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis William Smith, 32, was killed by officers after he fired shots at them 
shortly before midnight, said Sgt. Jay Fricke, a Placentia police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure how many shots were fired off," Fricke said. "One officer 
estimated at least two gunshots were fired by the suspect" before officers 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like a war going off," said Martin Garcia, 20, a neighbor who was 
walking back to his house when police opened fire. "It sounded like a 
free-for-all." 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Bill Johns, 43, said police "blasted off about 50 shots" like 
something "from the movies" before an officer yelled to cease fire. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Orange County district attorney's office combed the area 
Friday morning, examining Smith's bullet-riddled car and picking up spent shell 
casings and bullet fragments. A concrete wall that served as the backdrop for 
the midnight drama was pockmarked with bullet holes that investigators circled 
with yellow markers. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities disclosed few details of the events that led to the shooting of the 
officer, who has a pregnant wife and three children, or the gun battle in the 
vacant lot, which is bordered on two sides by pastel, wood-frame houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a number of investigators out there since last night," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Brian Brown, who is handling the shooting investigation. "It would 
be premature for me to talk about anything we've learned at this point. We'll 
try to get the investigation concluded as quickly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Police reported no other casualties besides Smith and the wounded officer. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, however, said a resident of the area, Robert Rodriguez, 32, was 
grazed on the lip by a stray bullet while he peeked from behind a concrete 
block wall during the final shoot-out. His mother, who declined to give her 
name, said Rodriguez was in good condition after being treated at the hospital 
and was interviewed by police Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at The Railroad Inn, a Placentia restaurant and bar where Smith's 
girlfriend worked as a bartender, said they were surprised by the events of 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time (Smith) came in, he seemed like a real nice guy," said Troy Cullen, 
a waiter at the restaurant. "Quiet. Real low-key." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a painter, and the woman, who was not identified by police, dated for 
about two months but did not live together, employees said. During their short 
courtship, Smith showered the girlfriend with presents, among them numerous 
gold rings, jewelry, necklaces and clothing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said there was no clue that anything was amiss in the relationship 
between the woman and Smith, a Texas native who served a stint in the Marines. 
Smith preferred to drink coffee rather than alcohol when he stopped by the 
tavern at the end of his girlfriend's shift, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was usually very quiet," said Gary Farrinton, a cook at the restaurant. "I 
never saw him out of line. . . . But he might have just wigged out." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the episode unfolded about 11:15 p.m., when the officer went 
to the restaurant in the 1200 block of East Orangethorpe Avenue in response to 
a report of a fight between Smith and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
When the officer confronted Smith in the parking lot, which is shared by a 
7-Eleven and other small shops that line the small commercial strip center, the 
boyfriend shot him, authorities allege. Smith fled in his car as the officer 
slumped to the ground, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Placentia police officer arrived just as Smith drove away and was told 
by his still-conscious colleague to pursue Smith, Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
After a short chase, Smith's car crashed through a light standard at a railroad 
crossing about a mile away. His car came to rest in the vacant lot, and Smith 
took cover behind the upraised engine hood as police closed in, Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers had fanned out behind squad cars and the low concrete walls of nearby 
houses, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors echoed police accounts of the final gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he was at his house nearby getting ready to sleep when he heard "a 
big bang" and ran out to find a man crouched behind a battered car, locked in a 
standoff with police. 
</P>
<P>
The stalemate lasted about 20 minutes, as officers used a loudspeaker to urge 
the gun-wielding man to give up his weapon and come out peacefully, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Johns, who lives directly across the vacant lot on Van Buren Street, said the 
cornered man alternately pointed his handgun at police and then raised it to 
his temple, as if preparing to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
At about midnight, the gunman lowered his weapon and "threw a few shots" at the 
officers, said Garcia, who watched the events with other neighbors from behind 
a wall about 50 feet down the street. One police officer responded by firing a 
shot back at the gunman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, a Placentia policeman ran over to Garcia and other huddled 
residents and ordered them to return home. A minute or two later, as the 
residents were milling toward their houses, "we just heard gunshots going 
wild," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like, man, it sounded very awful," he said. "I never heard anything 
like that."

U.S. HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS UCI DIVERSIONS ARE 'INAPPROPRIATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although UCI Medical Center officials are not violating federal law when their 
security guards advise women in labor to go to other hospitals, their 
controversial "obstetrical diversion" policy is "inappropriate" and will 
continue to be monitored, a federal health official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald M. Moskowitz, San Francisco regional administrator of the U.S. Health 
Care Financing Administration, said he still would like medical center 
administrators to halt the unusual practice, which has been used since June 2 
as a response to crowded emergency room and maternity wards at the hospital in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
And until the policy is abandoned, his staff will monitor it closely, Moskowitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's inappropriate -- oh yes," he said, "because I think folks coming 
to the facility should be able to come into the facility. That's what the law 
requires." 
</P>
<P>
But because the hospital allows pregnant women who insist on entering its 
crowded maternity ward to do so, it does not appear to be doing anything 
illegal, Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal and state laws, hospitals are required to examine and stabilize 
patients who show up for emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, "there has been no documented instance of patients diverted 
inappropriately (from UCI) to another facility," Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 1 letter to the medical center, Moskowitz had demanded that 
administrators halt the diversion policy immediately because that action 
"intimidates" pregnant women and could endanger their health and that of their 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
But after meeting with medical center Director Mary A. Piccione, her security 
director and other administrators on Thursday, Moskowitz said, "I am convinced 
the process they're using is with compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz's agency handles Medicare and Medi-Cal reimbursements to hospitals, 
but none of those funds are now threatened by the diversion policy, federal 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal inquiry was the second to conclude that UCI Medical Center was not 
violating any law with its diversion policy. 
</P>
<P>
In June, State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer said the policy was 
not illegal as long as security guards made it clear that a patient could still 
enter the hospital if she wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
Piccione said Thursday that Moskowitz appeared to understand that the medical 
center's policy began because the maternity ward was so crowded. Recently, as 
several hospitals dropped Medi-Cal contracts and their patients turned to UCI 
Medical Center, the obstetrics unit has been swamped -- handling more than 500 
deliveries a month in a facility built for 250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials "would like us not to do these diversions," Piccione said. 
But until there are other places that can handle these pregnant women -- more 
doctors and hospitals that will accept Medi-Cal patients or perhaps a birthing 
center, "that's pretty much what we have to do," she said. "When we have enough 
places to put the babies, it will be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz agreed, saying: "One needs to look at the entire situation. Our main 
concern is to correct the system." He added that his agency is encouraging 
state officials to add more Medi-Cal hospitals in Orange County and make 
reimbursements less cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center's controversial diversion policy was announced in June as 
Piccione and acting chief of obstetrics Thomas J. Garite sought to relieve 
maternity ward conditions that they described as crowded and unsafe. Doctors 
there have complained that there sometimes are not enough fetal monitors, 
oxygen tanks or beds for all patients. 
</P>
<P>
When a diversion procedure is in effect, security guards meet the pregnant 
women at the curb, handing them a map to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Since the policy began, 17 diversions have been announced, some lasting a few 
hours and three lasting more than a day, said hospital spokeswoman Elaine Beno. 
She said 27 pregnant women have gone elsewhere during diversions, and an 
unknown number have been admitted at their insistence. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz said Friday that he had initially become concerned about the 
diversion from news accounts of the practice. "My personal impression was there 
would certainly be intimidation. Uniforms certainly produce that kind of 
intimidation -- especially if there is a language barrier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Moskowitz said that in talking with Piccione and her staff, he learned that 
they consider their guards' notification to pregnant women "advisory." Also, 
Moskowitz said he was impressed that in one instance, seven or eight patients 
were admitted to UCI during a diversion period.

DRIVER FLEEING POLICE DIES AFTER STOLEN CAR RAMS ASPHALT ROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected car thief being pursued by police died Thursday night after he 
rammed a stolen car into a 10-ton asphalt roller parked on the street at a 
construction site, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose identity was withheld pending notification of relatives, was 
fleeing police at speeds of up to 80 m.p.h. in a short chase that started on 
the southbound San Diego Freeway around 11 p.m., said Irvine Police Sgt. Phil 
Povey. The driver had allegedly stolen a 1987 Hyundai Excel from Costa Mesa 
before the chase began, Povey said. 
</P>
<P>
The man left the freeway at Culver Drive, then turned west onto Campus Drive. 
</P>
<P>
With two police cars in pursuit, the suspect attempted to pass two cars in 
front of him, but ran into an asphalt roller in a lane that had been closed for 
construction near the UC Irvine campus, Povey said.

</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN IS SUBJECT OF HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Habra Redevelopment Agency will have a public hearing Sept. 19 on its 
five-year plan to spend $84 million to improve parks, widen streets and create 
new parking spaces downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The Resource Allocation Plan envisions eight major projects, and it is subject 
to regular reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Already under way are the expansion of the county library, improvements to 
Portola Park, the widening of La Habra Boulevard and the creation of new 
parking spaces in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious plans involve more than 115 acres scattered throughout the 
city. The $52-million project, authorized last July, involves commercial and 
industrial developments. 
</P>
<P>
One major feature is the demolition, to begin next year, of most of the Fashion 
Square Shopping Center at the northeast corner of Beach Boulevard and Imperial 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is a plan to replace the drive-in theater at the southeast corner 
of Imperial Highway and Idaho Street with a 200,000-square-foot retail center.

STAIRWAY TO SCHOOL WORRIES PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't take long for Janet and Greg Armstrong to name the steep flight of 
steps that their 11-year-old son must climb each day to get to class. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel couple have dubbed it "the death staircase" and are praying 
that it will not live up to the name. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound like I'm hoping for the worst," Janet Armstrong said 
Friday. "But it's an accident waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified School District officials, faced with a burgeoning student 
population, recently placed 12 portable classrooms on a narrow hilltop that 
overlooks Niguel Hills Junior High on Paseo Escuela, near Street of the Golden 
Lantern. The stairway is the only access to the elementary classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings, which opened Thursday, were ordered moved onto the site by the 
school board earlier this year to accommodate 300 fifth- and sixth-graders who 
are awaiting the opening of George L. White Elementary School, district 
spokeswoman Jacqueline Cerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Classes at the new school will begin sometime in January, school officials 
said, and the students will be transferred there from the portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, angry parents say, their children must walk up and down 
what they consider a hazardous stairway an average of four times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Already having placed calls to several administrators to make their fears 
known, the parents have vowed to organize to persuade school district officials 
to rip out the cement stairs and install a sloping trail up the 40-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it's an issue of safety," parent Greg Armstrong said. "We believe that 
the staircase is inadequate, unsafe, and (that) our child is at risk (along 
with) the children of other parents." 
</P>
<P>
The 68 steps have not been properly "roughed" for good footing during rainy 
days, parents contend. And they fear that in an emergency such as a fire, 
children hastening down the stairs could be trampled. 
</P>
<P>
School district administrators disagree that the stairs are unsafe, and say 
that they have devised a system to monitor the children going up and down. The 
children must walk in pairs, each pair four feet apart, and must hold on to 
guardrails, Niguel Hills Principal Jean Trygstad said. As many as six teachers 
watch them, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no problems the first day," said fifth-grade teacher Laurie Allen, who 
stood in front of Niguel Hills Junior High on Thursday morning to greet 
elementary students and escort them to the stairway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see (the stairs) as a hazard," she said, but added: "We do have to be 
really careful." 
</P>
<P>
William F. Dawson, a district assistant superintendent, said that the stairway, 
which was completed last week, "meets or exceeds" all city and state Department 
of Education building regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's very safe for those kids," Dawson said. While acknowledging that 
the stairway is considered substandard by district building inspectors, the 
inadequacies are all superficial, such as uneven steps, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"That staircase is structurally sound and safe for use," Dawson said. "We even 
tested it with hoses. It didn't get slippery." He confirmed, however, that 
there is an ongoing dispute with the contractor who built the stairway for 
failing to put a rough surface on the steps, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the district is withholding payment to the contractor until the 
staircase is refinished. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plans for building a ramp beside the stairway, Dawson said. The 
ramp, however, will be designed for use by maintenance and janitorial workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the kids will take the time to use the ramp," Dawson said. "It's 
going to be a long trail." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said that he is surprised to hear that parents began complaining about 
the stairway one day after school started. "I was at the orientation (Wednesday 
night), and parents didn't know who I was. And I didn't overhear one 
complaint." 
</P>
<P>
But several parents who attended orientation night said that they were shocked 
to see the staircase. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood at the top and got dizzy," Janet Armstrong said. "It's quite a trip up 
those stairs. You could have a heart attack."

YOUTH SLAIN IN SHOOTING; NEIGHBORS SAY GUNFIRE COMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Santa Ana youth standing in front of a house with some friends 
was killed in a drive-by shooting, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was withheld by investigators while they determined whether 
he was an intentional target, was standing on the front lawn of a house in the 
2300 block of West Elder Avenue at 8:48 p.m. Thursday when a white car drove 
by, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Words were exchanged and a flurry of shots was fired from a pistol, hitting the 
youth in the chest, she said. The car sped off, and police Friday had no one in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the neighborhood of single-family homes said such shootings are 
becoming a common occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too bad during the day, but at night, look out," said Sergio Lopez, 
15. "It's a nightmare. You can't walk down the street without looking behind 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Students gathered around an ice cream cart near West Elder after school Friday 
said they did not know the victim, but two youths said they believed the 
shooting was part of a turf war between rival Latino gangs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happening more and more," said Gary Vasquez, 17. "A lot of my friends are 
in gangs, and I'm worried for them." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said gang shootings "are well known in that part of Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Police would not disclose the names of the gangs in the area for fear of giving 
them notoriety, Thomas said, adding: "To do so would jeopardize the 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
Officers would not comment on the nature of their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Picon, a resident in the brown house where the shooting took place, said 
he did not know anyone involved in the shooting. The victim did not live there, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But on the street, passers-by said they worried about gunfire in the night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible environment for children," said Sylvia Hernandez, a mother of 
four. "It takes a lot of discipline to keep them away from gangs."

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: ANGEL RIDE: FUN WHILE IT LASTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unless Jose Canseco joins a gun club, Dennis Eckersley loses his nerve, Tony La 
Russa practices law, Rickey Henderson pouts, Mark McGwire bunts or Dave Parker 
puffs up, the Oakland Athletics are going to win the AL West and the Angels -- 
surprise -- are not. 
</P>
<P>
I told you so. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I also told you that the Angels would be out of the race by May and 
look what happened. They lasted until late summer and have won 80 games, five 
more than they won last year. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone picked this team to win the division, I want to meet the person and 
then say, "Liar, liar, Angel pants on fire." Either that, or recommend they 
seek professional care. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody chose the Angels to do this well in 1989. Even Gene Autry, who owns the 
team, didn't expect them to win this many games. A good season for Autry would 
have been 2.5 million fans and less cheese on his nachos. 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame him for modest expectations? The proposed Angel starting 
rotation was 40-54 the year before (or 49-57, if you count Jim Abbott's senior 
season at the University of Michigan). They didn't have the prototypal cleanup 
hitter. Their left fielder could produce heart murmurs, what with his very 
special brand of defense. Their newly acquired catcher had a history of back 
aches, to say nothing of batting-average ailments. The manager, if the stories 
were true, was good friends with Norman Bates. 
</P>
<P>
The '27 Yankees, they weren't. Or the '37, '47, '57 editions, either. 
</P>
<P>
They were, however, a team with enough holes and intrigue to earn a curious 
following. You figured these Angels to be awful, but in a fun, interesting way. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, that was before we discovered that Doug Rader had filed his fangs 
down from his stormy days as the Texas Ranger manager. Engaging isn't the right 
word to describe the new and improved Rader, but it's close. Turns out he was 
the perfect choice for a team in need of the strong, not-so-silent type. 
</P>
<P>
And who would have guessed that an aging practical joker would officially 
replace Mike Witt as the rotation's anchor piece? But there was Bert Blyleven, 
his curveball revived, his clubhouse pranks unleashed, winning games and 
friends on a team heretofore known for its stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
A polite round of applause also goes to Abbott, who won more games as a rookie 
major leaguer than he did last year in the Big Ten. And have you noticed that 
fewer people are using the usual qualifiers when mentioning his name. No longer 
is it, Abbott, who was born without a right hand . . . Now it's just pitcher 
Jim Abbott . . . 
</P>
<P>
Much better. 
</P>
<P>
There are other moments that tend to linger from this season, beginning with 
the time Chuck Finley sent Boston Red Sox All-Star Mike Greenwell to the dirt 
with a knockdown pitch. It may not sound like much, but Finley, who had watched 
Roger Clemens whiz one past Angel Jack Howell earlier in the game, was making a 
statement: the Angels wouldn't be intimidated, not even by a Clemens heater. 
</P>
<P>
And let me ask you one question about the play of one Mr. Charles Theodore 
Davis: 
</P>
<P>
What would you rather have -- a Gold Glove or another 20-plus home runs and 
80-plus runs batted in? 
</P>
<P>
I thought so. 
</P>
<P>
This also was a season of tranquility, thanks partly to Angel vice president 
Mike Port. Port pushed for Rader's hiring and was rewarded with an unexpected 
record. Port acquired Blyleven and took a chance on Abbott. And Port didn't 
waste half the spring pinching the copper out of pennies. His player 
negotiations didn't feature the bitterness of past bargaining sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I wonder if Port doesn't regret not doing more to get Rickey Henderson 
atop the Angel lineup. Instead, Henderson went to the A's and pestered the rest 
of the American League in an Oakland uniform. He ignited rallies, stole bases, 
forced mistakes. The Angels could have used him, as well as another starting 
pitcher, when Finley went down with a toe injury. But alas, nothing, though 
there were rumors of Yankee reliever Dave Righetti or Detroit Tiger Doyle 
Alexander coming to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
More moments . . . 
</P>
<P>
How about the gentle guidance of pitching coach Marcel Lachemann? Lachemann 
helped turn Finley into a 14-game winner. He led Abbott through a difficult 
rookie season. He did what he could with Witt. He didn't panic when reliever 
Bryan Harvey suffered his inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
And for those of you who were driven to chain-smoking when Harvey took the 
mound, remember this: he still allows fewer hits than innings pitched. Better 
yet, opponents are hitting less than .200 against him. One of the reasons -- 
Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
As Angel seasons go, 1989 was a doozy. It had drama and suspense, two items not 
seen in Anaheim Stadium since 1986. What it didn't have was a few more 
victories, which is why the A's soon will be dousing themselves with bubbly and 
the Angels won't. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, though. No one expected them to be soaked in champagne come October. 
And they were right -- sort of.

SHERMAN RUNS FOR 136 YARDS; EDISON TOPS EL MODENA, 21-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was enough ebb and flow, and change in tide and momentum to make a fan 
seasick in the season opener between Edison and El Modena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's running game, led by Shane Sherman's 136 yards, finally proved to be 
the difference in a 21-14 victory in front of 2,000 at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were effective mounting long drives. 
</P>
<P>
On its first possession, El Modena took over at its 19 following a Chargers' 
punt and marched 81 yards for a quick touchdown. Quarterback Adam Garcia hit 
Graham Brown with five- and nine-yard passes in the series. But the big play 
was a 33-yard touchdown run by sophomore tailback Tom Mazzone. 
</P>
<P>
Edison came right back and mounted a nine-play scoring drive. Sherman started 
the Charger series with a 25-yard run to move his team to El Modena's 45. 
Quarterback Donnie Smith had six and nine-yard passes and a nine-yard run. 
Craig Shusterick finally ran it in from the five to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Edison sacked Garcia for a nine-yard loss on the opening play of El Modena's 
next series, pushing the Vanguards back to their 15. El Modena's Mike 
Vermillion eventually was forced to punt from his end zone. Edison ended up in 
excellent field position at El Modena's 38 and scored nine plays later. Shane 
Sherman carried the ball six times in the drive for 22 yards and a one-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded touchdowns in the second half with Edison scoring first on a 
22-yard Smith-to-Brian Higgins pass for a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards came back early in the fourth quarter on the strength of Garcia's 
arm. He hit passes of 13 and 24 yards to Ron Murrietta and capped the 8-play 
drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Gavin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't quite put them away when we had a chance," Edison Coach Dave White 
said. "El Modena is a good team. I think it was more to its credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of flowed back and forth. Neither team really dominated," White said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers' Sherman certainly did, carrying the ball 23 times and scoring 
one touchdown. That, coupled with 25 yards rushing from the versatile Smith, 
gave Edison the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was six of 10 for 50 yards and one touchdown and one interception. Not 
exactly dominating but, along with his running, he got the job done. "We didn't 
throw a whole bunch but we're more of a running team, a play-action team," 
White said. "He's (Smith) a leader and that's the most important thing at the 
quarterback spot."

IT'S A MOST OFFENSIVE OPENING; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSES REST, FOUNTAIN VALLEY TOPS MATER DEI, 28-22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fountain Valley and Mater Dei high schools opened the season Friday night with 
their offenses in midseason form and their defenses looking less than 
respectable. 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 50 points and 711 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Fountain Valley, a team with only two returning starters from last 
season's Division I champion, won the game, 28-22, in front of 7,000 in Santa 
Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Willy Puga, a senior getting his first start at quarterback in a varsity game, 
looked like a veteran, completing 13 of 17 passes for 228 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game, I was really nervous, but I was trying not to be nervous," 
Puga said. "But people kept coming up to me before the game and asking 'Are you 
nervous?' That only made it worse." 
</P>
<P>
It was Puga's 27 yards pass to Rob Dubar early in the fourth quarter that gave 
Fountain Valley the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The pass came with 9:07 left in the game and Fountain Valley facing a 
fourth-and-four situation at the Mater Dei 27. Puga looked to his right and 
then floated the ball to Dubar in the left flat. Dubar, who caught six passes 
for 105 yards, outran two Mater Dei defenders to score. 
</P>
<P>
Dubar caught a 42-yard pass from Puga in the second quarter to open the game's 
scoring and ran 40 yards for another touchdown in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"I had huge holes to run through," Dubar said. "We had great offensive surge 
all game, and we just ran right up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
And Fountain Valley had great success all game running right at the Monarchs. 
Of course, it also had great success running right by them. Receiver Doug 
Weaver, the lone returning offensive starter from last season's team, caught 
four passes for 93 yards. He ran past the Mater Dei secondary and then caught a 
27-yard touchdown pass from Puga in the second quarter to put Fountain Valley 
ahead, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
The game was to be tied three times, with the pattern the same every time. The 
Barons would score first, then Mater Dei would match it. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei quarterback Danny O'Neil scored his team's first touchdown on a 
two-yard run. After Weaver's touchdown reception, O'Neil led Mater Dei on a 
60-yard drive that ended with running back Kealii Clifford scoring from a yard 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Down 22-14 in the third quarter, O'Neil completed a nine-yard touchdown pass to 
David Gonzalez and then threw a pass to Jonathon Packard for a two-point 
conversion to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil completed 15 of 22 passes for 182 yards. He also rushed for 56 yards on 
10 carries. Clifford gained 89 yards on 11 carries and caught five passes for 
52 yards.

HUNTINGTON BEACH STOPS CORONA DEL MAR'S STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corona del Mar High School learned the painful lesson Friday night that a team 
can't live off its past accomplishments and glory. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings entered their season opener with the longest unbeaten streak (14) 
in Orange County, but they was no match for Huntington Beach in a stunning 19-6 
loss in front of 2,200 fans on Huntington's Sheue Field. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar posted a 12-0-2 record while winning the Division VI 
championship last year, and big things were expected again with some talented 
players such as twin receivers Warren and Weston Johnson returning. 
</P>
<P>
But the Johnsons never got their hands on the ball as Huntington Beach limited 
Corona del Mar to only 44 yards passing and intercepted two passes. Tailback 
Brian Lucas was the only standout for the losers, gaining 102 yards in nine 
carries, including a 76-yard touchdown run that kept his team from being shut 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach, which won only two games last year, piled up 178 yards 
rushing and 16 first downs as it controlled both lines of scrimmage and outhit 
the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Cunningham, a converted wide receiver, gained 98 yards in 24 carries and 
scored a touchdown to lead the Oilers' rushing offense. Kelly Cotton, a 
transfer from Los Amigos, added 31 yards in seven carries and also scored a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited about our chances this season going into the game, and now I'm 
really excited," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said. "The kids have 
dedicated themselves since last January to having a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
"They worked hard in the weight room and it showed tonight. Last year, we 
didn't have a running game. Tonight, we ran against a good football team. I'm 
surprised, but I also know how hard the kids have worked." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach didn't exactly get off to a rousing start, throwing an 
interception on its first play and losing possession on a fumble the next time 
it had the ball. But Cunningham led the Oilers on an 80-yard drive late in the 
first quarter with some fine running that resulted in a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's defense limited Corona del Mar to only one first down in the 
opening half, and the Oilers extended their lead to 12-0 early in the third 
quarter following an interception by Cunningham, who doubles as a strong 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar had problems generating offense all evening, but the Sea Kings 
had figured to start slowly this year with a sophomore quarterback in Todd 
Kehrli. Kehrli completed only 6 of 17 pass attempts, repeatedly overthrowing 
open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid just needs to get some playing time," said Dave Holland, Corona del 
Mar coach. "We didn't have the ball much tonight, and they've got almost their 
entire defense back, so this was a big test for him. We're going to be all 
right. It will just take time."

MISSION VIEJO COASTS PAST LONG BEACH JORDAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo, led by quarterback Don Disbro and tailback Mark Gaw, rolled to 
an easy 42-0 victory over Long Beach Jordan in the season opener for both teams 
Friday night before 1,800 at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos led the defending Moore League co-champions, 28-0, at halftime and 
then added 14 third-quarter points to coast to the win. 
</P>
<P>
Disbro passed for two first-half touchdowns, scored a on a nine-yard run and 
kicked all six extra points. Gaw scored Mission Viejo's first touchdown on a 
five-yard pass from Disbro, and ran 10 and 17 yards for two other scores. On 
the night, Disbro was 11 for 20 for 102 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Also scoring for Mission Viejo were wide receiver Terry Kesner, on a 5-yard 
pass from Disbro, and fullback Ryan Darke, on a 2-yard run. VINCE AGUL

WOODBRIDGE PREVAILS OVER SAN CLEMENTE, 24-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior quarterback Gary Fishel did most of his damage in the first half of 
Woodbridge High School's 24-12 victory at San Clemente Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fishel, who totalled 142 yards on 9 for 23 passing, threw for 133 of those in 
the first half, when he hit five passes of 18-or-more yards. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge scored first following Larry Brophy's fumble at the San Clemente 
10-yard line. Steve Masters scored from one yard out with 5:04 left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente roared back to score on a nine-yard pass from Mario Watkins to 
Brophy with 2:28 left in the first quarter to tie the game at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente went ahead on a 41-yard field goal by Derek Marshall with 9:57 
left in the second quarter, but Woodbridge took the lead for good before 
halftime on a 14-yard touchdown run by Scott Seymour.

VILLA PARK POUNDS BOLSA GRANDE, 45-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes everything goes right for a football player. Take Gary Bladow, for 
example. Virtually every time Bladow carried the ball for Villa Park High 
School Friday night against Bolsa Grande, something good happened for the 
Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Bladow only rushed 11 times, but he gained 112 yards, and his two touchdowns 
were a big reason for Villa Park's 45-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Bolsa Grande was that the night was going well for the rest of 
the Spartan backfield as well. Craig Moresco ran for 69 yards; Shane Norris ran 
for 47 and Shawn Potter ran for 35 yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Jason 
Martian completed three of his seven passes for 61 yards and a touchdown. You 
get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take the points when we get them," said Villa Park coach Pat Mahoney. 
"They were hard to come by last year." 
</P>
<P>
This Spartan defense didn't allow Bolsa to come close to the end zone. Of 
course, Bolsa didn't give itself much of a chance as it fumbled away its first 
three possessions. And on the fourth, with Bolsa already behind 9-0, Villa 
Park's Garrett Johnson tacked Bolsa punter Tim Desrosiers on the one-yard line 
after Desrosiers ran down an errant snap. 
</P>
<P>
Bladow followed with one of his touchdowns and the game was all but over with 
the Spartans leading, 17-0.

NEWPORT HARBOR POUNDS LAGUNA BEACH

<P>
Newport Harbor High School overpowered host Laguna Beach, 30-6, in the 
non-league opener for both teams Friday at Guyer Field. 
</P>
<P>
Junior kicker Josh Klein accounted for 11 of Newport Harbor's points on field 
goals of 45, 36 and 35 yards and two extra points. 
</P>
<P>
Senior running back Todd Farley scored the first Newport Harbor touchdown on a 
two-yard run, and senior quarterback Stephen Scheck connected with junior tight 
end George Greenwalt on an 11-yard touchdown pass for the other Newport Harbor 
score. Scheck completed 13 of 21 passes for 98 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight for Laguna Beach came early in the first quarter, when linebacker 
Sean Mallett hit Scheck in the backfield, causing a fumble, and defensive 
tackle Simplicio Rimando recovered at the Newport Harbor 22. Three plays later, 
Mallett burst into the end zone to make it 6-0 with 5:30 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Farley was the leading ground-gainer for Newport Harbor with 90 yards on 12 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach senior quarterback Aaron Scheid completed 10 of 19 passes for 116 
yards. Senior flanker Eric Spraker caught five of Scheid's passes for 55 yards.

SADDLEBACK REAPS POSITIVE RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
COACH'S NEGATIVE OUTLOOK IS AN INCENTIVE FOR HIS PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback College football Coach Ken Swearingen is seldom optimistic about his 
team this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
He normally spends most of his time talking about the holes the Gauchos have to 
fill. 
</P>
<P>
But judging from his record, the questions generally get answered, and his 
teams are usually in contention for a conference title by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen has a 213-54-6 record in 27 seasons. He was 98-31-5 in 14 seasons at 
El Camino, and is 115-23-1 at Saddleback over the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen's teams have won 12 conference titles, 10 at Saddleback. His best 
season was 1985, when Saddleback was 11-0 and won the J.C. Grid-Wire mythical 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the success, Swearingen seldom has many positive things to say 
about his team at the start of the season, and this fall is no different. 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarterback is gone, so is his backup and so is his backup," Swearingen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Saddleback returns only three offensive starters, none of whom played 
a full season. There are three part-time starters back on defense as well. 
</P>
<P>
John Burns rushed for 459 yards in 96 carries last season and is back at 
tailback. He suffered a broken leg, missing three games, but is healthy again. 
Center Mark Esposito missed the last half of the season because of a knee 
injury but is also healthy. Dylan Candelaria returns at tackle after being a 
part-time starter last fall. 
</P>
<P>
John Barnes, who played at Trabcuo Hills High School two seasons ago, and 
Robbie Adams, who played at Mission Viejo two seasons ago, are the favorites in 
the quarterback derby. 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen's concern is that neither has played a down of college football. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the job will be throwing to one of the county's best freshman 
receivers: Mike Cook of Fountain Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Cook passed on nearby Golden West and Orange Coast in favor of traveling to 
Saddleback, which throws the ball more often than most area colleges. Cook will 
replace Scott Miller, who led the state with 78 catches. Miller is playing at 
UCLA this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Allison, an all-Pacific Coast League receiver from Laguna Hills High 
School, and Toney Jenkins, an all-South Coast League receiver from Capistrano 
Valley High School, are among many wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
The defensive line returns Mike Montreuil at defensive end, and Tony Perry is 
back at tackle after playing mostly on special teams last season. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback got immediate help at linebacker thanks to a couple of transfers. 
One is Mike Spinello from Mission Viejo High School, who played very little as 
a freshman at San Diego State. The other is Chris Drossos from Purdue; he was a 
USA Today All-American in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Smith had a team-leading five interceptions last season and is back at 
one corner. Kendall Robbins and Greg Riles also return, but neither played much 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
Riverside joins Fullerton, Golden West, Orange Coast, Rancho Santiago and 
Saddleback to make up the six-team Central Division of the Mission Conference. 
El Camino is the favorite again in the Northern Division, which also has 
Cerritos, Mt. San Antonio, Long Beach and Pasadena. San Diego Mesa and 
Southwestern appear to be the class of the Southern Division. San Grossmont, 
Palomar and San Diego City round out the division.

THIS YEAR, FULLERTON TRIES TO KEEP GUARD UP FOR NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
This week, a lesson in comparison and contrast at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Week 2 opponent: West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
This year's: Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
They do use the same football. Shall we turn to contrasts? 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, the team that would in recent years go anywhere and play anyone for 
a guarantee check, have turned the tables. This time, it's Northridge, a 
Division II team that has been lured into the stadium of a team that plays on a 
higher level. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find a big-guarantee game that fit the Titans' needs this season, 
Athletic Director Ed Carroll turned to Northridge to fill a home date, 
fulfilling a Fullerton guideline that calls for at least four home games a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The game at Santa Ana Stadium today (1 p.m.) will mark the first time in seven 
years that the Titans have played a Division II team. The last was Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo in 1982, a 14-10 Fullerton victory. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coach Gene Murphy, who will be going against a former assistant in 
Northridge Coach Bob Burt, has been admonishing his players not to take this 
game lightly. 
</P>
<P>
You can hear the echoes of his cautions in the players' words. 
</P>
<P>
"They have good athletes," said running back Mike Pringle. "They're going to 
come after us. This is a game we have to play, and we're going to." 
</P>
<P>
To Murphy, the issue is not the Roman numeral of a team's division, but the 
caliber of the team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"What every coach wants is an opportunity to be competitive against the 
opponent," Murphy said. "We will be competitive with Northridge. And they will 
be competitive with us, and they know it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were higher in the hierarchy of Division I, it would be something else," 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the Titans will meet a good Division II team, one that trailed Cal 
State Long Beach only 7-3 in the fourth quarter last week before losing, 28-9. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the team . . . (we) are Division I-A, but if they think they are better 
than anybody, they could be mistaken," Murphy said. "We're not awesome enough 
to look past anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will be trying to get its first victory of the season against 
Northridge and will try to establish a running game in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fullerton had 309 yards of offense in a 26-17 loss to Northern 
Illinois -- and 304 of those yards were passing. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who averaged 4.7 yards per carry last season, had 14 yards on 10 
carries. No other Fullerton player had positive yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're capable of running the ball, and we will run the ball," Pringle said. "I 
have a lot of confidence in my offensive line. I think the line takes it to 
heart that we didn't have success. I know I take it to heart." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Free safety Mike Schaffel, who suffered a concussion in the first quarter of 
last week's game, only walked through practices this week but will play today. 
With Schaffel out, the Fullerton secondary was significantly weakened. "It's 
good to get Schaffel back," Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. . . . 
Second-year freshman Mike Kent from Esperanza High School will start at tight 
end, replacing Bill Brennan, who suffered a hip pointer in last week's game and 
is questionable for today. . . . Cal State Northridge Coach Bob Burt was the 
defensive coordinator under Murphy 1980-85. "We'll probably stand out at 
midfield before the game and talk about everything but football," Burt said. . 
. . Albert Fann, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound tailback, ran for 110 yards for 
Northridge last week and Quarterback Paul Oates completed 19 of 27 passes for 
296 yards. . . . Tom Berry, a junior who went to Cypress High School and Mt. 
San Antonio College, starts on the defensive line for Northridge. Preston 
Hayslette, a senior linebacker from Marina High School, is a starter and a 
captain. . . . A taped interview with Augie Garrido, the former Cal State 
Fullerton baseball coach now at Illinois, will be aired at halftime of the KMNY 
broadcast.

CALIFORNIA YACHTS TO CLOSE THREE O.C. PLANTS, LAY OFF 138 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 138 employees of Tustin-based Californian Yachts Inc. were told Friday that 
the main plant and two smaller facilities in Santa Ana and Anaheim will be shut 
down by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Volz, chief financial officer for Carver Boat Corp., California Yachts' 
parent company, said that a "market softening in the marine industry" was 
behind the Pulaski, Wis., company's decision to consolidate operations and 
continue building its luxury motor yachts in a more modern plant in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad because we run a profitable division," said Jerry Henry, manager of 
the Tustin plant. "If the market had not decreased, we'd still be operating." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County used to be one of the boat-building capitals of the world, but in 
recent years many manufacturers have shut down or moved to the East Coast, as 
escalating rents and strict air pollution controls in Southern California have 
cut into profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unfortunate situation, but the company feels it is necessary, 
given the market," Volz said. 
</P>
<P>
Carver considered building a new Southern California plant, Volz said, and even 
conducted an engineering study. 
</P>
<P>
But strict regulations on pollutants released into the air by the materials 
involved in boat building -- including wood, paint and fiberglass -- made the 
project unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
By boat manufacturing standards, Carver's Tustin plant is small, producing one 
of the company's 42- to 48-foot yachts a week. The new plant near Wilmington, 
N.C., now produces three yachts a week and is not yet running at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Carver California yachts ranges from $300,000 to $500,000 and 
can go up considerably depending on options. "It is not unlike a luxury car; 
there are a number of standard items and optional features," Volz said. 
</P>
<P>
Yacht building is "very labor-intensive," Volz said, with many of the jobs 
requiring a high level of skill. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he believed Carver had planned to shut down the Tustin plant, at 
1402 Morgan Circle, when the lease on the facility expired in 1991, but that 
the market downturn accelerated the timetable. He said the marine market "has 
got to be off 40%." 
</P>
<P>
Company employees knew that sales were slow and had heard rumors of the plant 
being closed but still "they were surprised this was finally happening," Henry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the employees are protected under the plant-closing notification rules of 
the federal government," he said. The plant-closing law, which took effect 
earlier this year, requires most employers to give workers 60-days notice of a 
plant closing or large layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who has worked for California Yachts for 11 years, said Carver would 
help some employees find other jobs in the shrinking boat-manufacturing 
business and help others find jobs in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Volz said Carver has not yet determined whether it will offer any of the Orange 
County employees a transfer to the company's other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Tustin plant closure, Carver is laying off 90 of its 1,020 
employees in Wisconsin, he said.

J.M. PETERS REPORTS DROP IN PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J.M. Peters Co. Inc., the Newport Beach home builder, said profits dropped to 
$3.5 million in the second quarter on housing sales of $56.6 million, compared 
to $7.3 million in profits on $86.1 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
The lower earnings disappointed stock analysts, who had projected profits of as 
much 75 cents a share earlier this year. That was far higher than the 25 cents 
a share the company actually earned in its fiscal second quarter, which ended 
Aug. 31. Last year the company earned 53 cents a share, or 53% more. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts attributed the problems to construction delays, particularly in 
J.M. Peters' Los Angeles markets. That meant the company sold fewer homes even 
though orders for homes increased: Buyers ordered 322 homes during the second 
quarter compared to 277 last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Peters earned $8.5 million on sales of 
$112.1 million, compared to $14.5 million on sales of $173 million. New orders 
for the first half were down by nearly 200 homes, the company reported, or 25%. 
From 758 last year, orders dropped to 572 this year.

INTEREST IN BATMAN ART GOES BOOM!; 
</P>
<P>
WORK OF COMICS ILLUSTRATOR BOB KANE FEATURED IN TRAVELING SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Holy Bat Merchandising! 
</P>
<P>
Batman shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Batman shoes and socks. 
</P>
<P>
Batman books and posters. 
</P>
<P>
Batman albums. Batman pins. 
</P>
<P>
And now Batman art. 
</P>
<P>
The work of illustrator Bob Kane, who created the super-hero with a dark side 
50 years ago for DC Comics, is now the subject of a traveling show, "Batman: An 
American Icon," at the Brea Gallery through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, there's not a whole lot to it. Only one of the sketches actually 
ended up in a comic book (in 1962). 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the show is just fairly stock paintings of the Batman characters 
and quickie sketches of the Caped Crusader, apparently knocked out for Kane's 
acquaintances and fans (e.g., "To my friends Abby and Shane -- Best always"). 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Scott, who organized the exhibit for the Titus Fine Arts gallery in 
Beverly Hills, maintains that interest in Bob Kane was running high even before 
the current Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson movie infected us all with Bat-fever. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kane's illustrations even hangs in the Museum of Modern Art in New York 
City, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the frenzy sparked by the movie apparently now has lent Kane, who served 
as a consultant on the film, a golden touch. 
</P>
<P>
Those simple sketches -- which date to the '60s and '70s and were done for 
friends and admirers, are offered here for as much as $9,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
The comic book sketch is priced at a cool $10,500. (Scott said original 
sketches for the Batman comic books are extremely rare: "I don't know of 
another one around.") 
</P>
<P>
Kane, who stopped illustrating the comics in 1966, now splits his time between 
homes in Hawaii and Los Angeles and continues to paint and draw. 
</P>
<P>
An oil painting titled "Batman Over Gotham," the basis for the exhibit poster 
($50) and a lithograph ($1,595), recently sold in London for $100,000, 
according to Claire Oliver of the Brea Gallery. A pastel with the faces of 
Batman, Robin, Catwoman, Joker and Penguin is on sale at Brea for $49,500. 
</P>
<P>
Early interest in the exhibit was strong, according to Oliver, who said several 
of the posters and lithographs sold before the show even opened. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers, she said, "are wanting to share something they grew up with with their 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
After Brea, the exhibit will move to other galleries in the United States and 
eventually, organizers say, to London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Permission to photograph any of the art was denied by the show's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Batman: An American Icon" continues through Sunday at the Brea Gallery, 
downstairs in the May Co. wing of the Brea Mall. Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
today, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Information: (714) 990-6636.

STUDYING THE FINE (FOOT)PRINT AT THE SEASHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISE T. CHISOLM, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wet sand of early morning, no two sets of footprints look alike. 
</P>
<P>
The physiognomy of the human foot is a marvel of ambiguity. I become entranced 
with it while walking at low tide during five vacation days at South Bethany 
Beach, Del. 
</P>
<P>
Here, where the foam of the waves leaves the sand slightly vulnerable, I walk 
my three miles each morning. 
</P>
<P>
I gaze seaward and wonder at the rhythm of the tide, the continuous reminder of 
nature's forces. 
</P>
<P>
The first morning, like a forensic expert, a police detective, I begin to study 
the foot patterns in the sand -- all so varied. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes a challenge, a game to see if I can tell the runner from the walker, 
the women from the men, the overweights from the thins. 
</P>
<P>
I can, and so can you. 
</P>
<P>
Here the runner's foot digs deeper into the sand at the toe while the walker's 
foot digs in at the heel. 
</P>
<P>
The male stride is longer, and the man's footprint seems to splay outward more 
than the woman's. 
</P>
<P>
The more serious runners leave prints of designer shoes: Reebok, Nike and 
Adidas -- wonderful designs like a modern abstract -- herringbone, corrugated, 
geometric patterns leaving the imprint of the latest art in man's material 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Even prints of the gulls give me a feeling of being part of the order of 
things. Their tiny imprints mingle with the record of the designer shoes. 
</P>
<P>
If you get up at dawn and run or walk in the cool of the seaside morning, you 
are probably serious about your body: your blood pressure, your cholesterol, 
your weight, your muscles. These prints tell me these people are here for good 
health. 
</P>
<P>
I try to put my footprints in some of the designs -- impossible; it doesn't 
work. Some people seem to run incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
You may ask me now why I'm looking down, at footprints, and not enjoying the 
magnificence of the ocean. But I am; it is never better than in the morning 
before the desecraters of beaches stake out a place for their noisy radios, 
kids, plastic throwaways and garbage. But the footprints make me think about 
the human being to whom they are connected and the wonderful mechanism of the 
human body that works so intricately while running or walking. I ponder and 
praise the amazing structure presented on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown footprints are as mesmerizing as the mysteries of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder about the people whose prints I study. Are they good or bad? Greedy, 
giving, caring, spiritual, sexual, tragic or troubled? Are they housewives, 
stockbrokers, truck drivers or biochemists? 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a small, shoeless print: a child running with a parent. I follow 
their paths to a sandy knoll where they seem to have sat down and rested. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine them looking seaward and the child asking the same questions my 
3-year-old asked when she first saw the ocean: "Mom, what makes the waves? Do 
they ever stop?" 
</P>
<P>
I like to think about parent and child communicating without the television and 
the noises of home. 
</P>
<P>
I was sure I'd see more men's prints than women's. Don't more men than women 
run in the morning? 
</P>
<P>
I counted, and I found more women's -- good! Things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Footprints in the sand are like dreams, ephemeral; you can read into them 
anything you like. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is later, and the tide is encroaching on my detective work. 
</P>
<P>
What fun it has been to guess about people. And as the waves start slapping at 
my feet, I'd like to think that these are happy people who have walked before 
me -- as free-spirited as the soaring and ever-present gulls. 
</P>
<P>
And that is what vacations are all about: doing something you don't do at work, 
giving space to speculation and wonderment. Unencumbered.

PSYCHOLOGIST TELLS OF MEMORY'S TRICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROCHESTER, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memory, it's been said, is the thing you forget with. Or, as playwright Harold 
Pinter once commented, "The past is what you remember, imagine you remember, 
convince yourself you remember, or pretend to remember." 
</P>
<P>
A University of Rochester psychologist who has studied the way people recall 
their experiences agrees that indeed, when people think about their past, their 
memories are anything but reliable. 
</P>
<P>
"What we might call autobiographical memories are different from the mind's 
data storage capacity for things like phone numbers, state capitals, or the 
Pledge of Allegiance," Craig Barclay says. 
</P>
<P>
Many people think of memory as a file cabinet that stores facts ready for 
retrieval, or as a videocassette recorder with instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Edit Memories 
</P>
<P>
But Barclay contends that when we try to recall things past, our memory behaves 
more like a historian writing a biography: Just as the author sifts through his 
subject's past, highlighting some events and downplaying others, so do 
individuals freely edit personal memories. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the old man who was a bench warmer for his high school football team may 
now vividly recall his glories on the gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his first studies about memory, Barclay asked six adults to keep a 
diary of three events daily for four months, then turn over the diary to him. 
Over the next 2 1/2 years, Barclay tested them on what they had written. Each 
test included some of the subject's original records of events, some "foils" -- 
original records that Barclay altered -- and a few totally fictitious events. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, they were able to identify their original records with precision 
over the course of the study," Barclay says. "And they also rejected false 
memories -- at first. But after five months, while they continued to identify 
correctly their own records, they began to accept false memories as their own, 
with a relatively high level of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Barclay looked at how accuracies and inaccuracies in 
autobiographical memories may be tied to people's attitudes and beliefs about 
themselves. A study to be published later this year compared women with 
Premenstrual Syndrome to a control group not subject to PMS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mood Affects Memory 
</P>
<P>
The research supported the claim that mood does interact with our attitudes and 
beliefs about ourselves to affect our memories. For example, when tested, PMS 
subjects were found to be more error-prone than the control group in 
distinguishing between original records and altered ones. (Barclay theorized 
that PMS subjects were distracted by mood swings and thus stored less specific 
information.) 
</P>
<P>
However, the control group -- people who in psychological tests showed that 
they had a more positive view of themselves -- had trouble remembering negative 
events in their past. In other words, thinking positively about oneself isn't 
just a self-fulfilling prophecy, it can be a self-fulfilling "history" as well. 
Barclay terms the phenomenon the "Pollyanna Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Even "flashbulb" memories -- those pictures we carry around in our heads of 
what happened on an important day -- are subject to distortion, Barclay says. 
</P>
<P>
"People have shown that, even though these memories seem extremely vivid after 
many years, they can be quite inaccurate. A researcher at the University of 
Utah tells the story of one of her colleagues who said, years after President 
Kennedy was killed, 'I know that you came down to my office and told me about 
what you had heard on the news.' She went back and checked, and she had been in 
Washington that day." 
</P>
<P>
The study of memory as it occurs in real life, and how it may be linked to what 
sort of person we believe ourselves to be, is a relatively unexplored field for 
psychologists, Barclay says. But the phenomenon of memory has interested human 
beings through the centuries, and writers from Shakespeare to Proust have 
explored it. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my ideas have come from literary criticism, not from psychology," 
Barclay says. "I think writers have understood memory for a much longer time 
than psychologists."

The Rev. Patrick L. Williams of Crest-Moore-King United Methodist Church in 
Dallas may be critical of President Bush's drug program, but he is one of a 
growing number of clergy who are not relying on the government to solve the 
drug crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is heading an effort in the Texas-New Mexico area to encourage local 
churches to create four-block "drug-free" areas in their communities, pulling 
together the expertise of a variety of counselors, therapists, social workers, 
church workers and other professionals to do the job.

The Dallas minister is Southwest coordinator for the Black Family/Community and 
Crack Cocaine National Network, a group which grew out of a conference held in 
April in San Francisco organized by the Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide 
Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco.

Conference This Month 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Williams, who is not related to the San Francisco minister, said he 
hopes the program begins to take shape in the Southwest Sept. 22-23, when an 
organizing conference takes place at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
He said the idea of drug-free zones will be tested at the conference, 
commenting, "I don't know whether the community is going to buy into it." 
</P>
<P>
But if that approach that is adopted, then all of the resources of the 
communities will be brought to bear to completely "turn around" the four-block 
areas, wresting control from drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, noted Williams, there has been a vast outpouring of support from 
professionals who work in the drug rehabilitation field. More than 100 have 
signed up for the conference.

Few From Clergy 
</P>
<P>
The clergy response has not been so encouraging. "I have to be honest with 
you," Williams told Religious News Service in a telephone interview. "The 
response (from clergy) has not been that overwhelming. . . . We're lucky if we 
have a dozen." 
</P>
<P>
Williams explained, "My theory is that the church is in denial in such a big 
way that it's hard for us to admit we're impotent in this area." 
</P>
<P>
But he is not giving up. He said he plans to send representatives to churches 
with personal invitations to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dallas area, Williams noted, he plans to flood the area with 23,000 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
"The clergy have not been very responsive, that's the bottom line, and we're 
the ones who should be leading the charge," Williams said.
