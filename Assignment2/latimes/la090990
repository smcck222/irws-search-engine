REACHING BACK AND GIVING LIFE TO PHILIPPINES' MUSICAL PAST; 
</P>
<P>
A SMALL TROUPE OF MUSICIANS WORKING FROM A RESEDA GARAGE HOPES TO KEEP THE 
KULINTANG TRADITION ALIVE IN AMERICA.

<P>
The music of the kulintang, a multi-gong instrument with a history stretching 
back into the 3rd Century, is rarely heard these days outside of small, 
isolated villages in the southern Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Those villages are not easy to visit. Because of sporadic fighting between 
government troops and Muslim secessionists in the area, musicologists 
determined to study the kulintang and associated instruments are warned that 
travel to the villages can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Los Angeles Festival officials searching out the traditional music of 
Asia had to look for kulintang no farther than Reseda. There, in a garage that 
is also used as a martial arts studio, is the World Kulintang Institute, the 
headquarters for a small troupe of musicians who aim to bring the kulintang 
tradition to life in this country. 
</P>
<P>
A five-person ensemble sponsored by the institute will play music for the 
kulintang and accompanying instruments at three festival events. It will appear 
Thursday night as one of the opening acts for the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Next Saturday and Sunday the ensemble will be 
part of the free Around Town series at Descanso Gardens in La Canada 
Flintridge. Finally, it will play next Sunday evening as part of an Around Town 
bill at the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Among the musicians who will be playing are two of the best known kulintang 
players in the United States, Danongan Sibay Kalanduyan, who gives kulintang 
lessons in San Francisco, and Usopay Cadar, who teaches in Seattle. Also 
playing will be Eleanor Academia, a local singer, songwriter and musician who 
founded the World Kulintang Institute in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a music that has been handed down from generation to generation all 
these hundreds of years without anything being written down," said Academia, 
"so, there certainly has to be something to it." 
</P>
<P>
Academia, 26, mixed music of the kulintang with far more modern electronic 
instruments on her pop album, "Jungle Wave," released by Columbia Records in 
1987. Her second album, "Global Conversation," is scheduled to be released next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are involved in other forms of music, but a tradition as rich as 
the kulintang's should be paid attention to," she said, "especially by 
Filipinos who feel it is important to keep a connection with their heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Musicologists believe the kulintang originated on the island of Borneo and was 
eventually introduced to the Philippine island of Mindanao. Although it's most 
closely associated with parts of the Philippines that are now Muslim, Academia 
said the kulintang is not, as it is often described even in that country, an 
Islamic instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam didn't become prominent in the region until the late 1300s," she said. 
"By then, the kulintang had already been there for several centuries." 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand Magellan's ship historian made note of the "gong music of the 
natives" in a journal when the famed explorer made his ill-fated visit to the 
archipelago in 1521. Shortly after the journal note was made, when the ship 
docked at the island of Cebu, Magellan was killed during a battle with natives. 
</P>
<P>
The kulintang basically consists of a set of five to 11 gongs, depending on 
which village it comes from, sitting in a row on a wood frame. The gongs were 
originally made entirely of bronze but are now usually made of a mixture of 
bronze and the more plentiful brass. 
</P>
<P>
Kulintangs are never played in duos, because the pitch is always slightly 
different. "After they cast each set, they break the molds," Academia said. 
"That way, each set is unique." 
</P>
<P>
A full kulintang ensemble has several supporting instruments, including two 
large kettle gongs and a goblet-shaped drum. 
</P>
<P>
Academia, who was born in Hawaii and raised mostly in San Diego, had barely 
heard of the kulintang when she was a music student at USC in the late '70s. "I 
had gotten into jazz, classical, R&amp;B, soul, pop, just about everything but 
the music of my own heritage, she said, "with a goal of becoming a recording 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen a visiting dance troupe that used some kulintang music, but it was 
recorded so I didn't see the instruments. And later I found out it wasn't 
really authentic, traditional kulintang music." 
</P>
<P>
On a summer break in San Diego in 1980 she met Bayani DeLeon, a musician who 
specialized in traditional music of the Philippines. "He challenged me," 
Academia said. "He said to me, 'How can you really consider yourself a musician 
if you do not know the music of your own country?' " 
</P>
<P>
Academia began studying the kulintang with him and in 1984 she and her younger 
brother, Jerome, who is also a musician and will be playing with the ensemble 
during the festival, traveled to Manila to further their studies. They had 
planned to visit the southern villages where the kulintang is still part of 
village rituals and entertainment, but the unsettled political situation didn't 
allow for that. 
</P>
<P>
She traveled back and forth between Los Angeles and Manila several times to 
continue her studies. Last year, she received a $21,400 grant from the National 
Endowment for the Arts to start the institute in her husband's martial arts 
studio. She brought in Kalanduyan and Cadar to teach a series of workshops over 
several months. Later grants paid for more workshops and kulintang players 
trained at the institute have played several local concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Academia hopes that her institute will one day be able to cast its own gongs, 
which are still made only in the Philippines and range in price from about $400 
for what she described as a "tourist set," to the authentic models that can 
cost up to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
She also hopes to raise money to create a notation system for kulintang songs 
and to set them down on paper in case the oral tradition is interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
She will continue to use the kulintang in her pop music, but said she will 
never go the other way and try to bring modern influences to the strict regimen 
of kulintang playing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep the two completely separate," she said. "Once you start 
mixing something into traditional music, there is confusion. 
</P>
<P>
There is something about that music that has allowed it to last this long. When 
you start messing with that, it can be lost."

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: ECSTASY SINGER MAKES FORAY INTO ORIGINAL MATERIAL WITH 
FAULTLINE AFTER TIRING OF TOP 40 
</P>

<P>
The days of Ecstasy are over. For eight years, the band, perhaps the San 
Fernando Valley's most popular Top 40 group, played each weekend at the Sasch 
in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
But former lead singer Debra Raye is more ecstatic than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time for some new blood," Raye said, "and we got it. Things were 
getting real boring at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Raye recently formed a new group, Faultline, with ex-Ecstasy guitarist Gary 
Edwards and keyboardist Craig Jones. She said the new group, which has also 
played a few weekends at Sasch, comes closer to her true musical roots. "We're 
definitely into a lot more rock 'n' roll," she said. "We have more energy, plus 
we're doing our own material. Before, everyone was sticking to the same Top 40 
format." 
</P>
<P>
At first, she admitted, she was concerned that the Sasch audience would be 
confused by her band's new name. She said, however, that fans recognize her 
from Ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
Raye doesn't want Faultline to become the next Ecstasy, relying on the Sasch 
gig. "We don't want to be there every weekend, getting back into the same rut. 
And we don't want to just tour all the clubs as one of those Top 40 groups. We 
want to do originals." 
</P>
<P>
She said the band will try to play its new material at one of the club's 
upcoming nights of original rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Raye, Edwards and Jones, Faultline's members include bass player John 
Menzano and drummer Tim Pedersen. Raye said she believes that the remaining 
ex-Ecstasy members are trying to keep that band alive. 
</P>
<P>
Venice, the popular Los Angeles band, is scheduled this week to release its 
first nationwide single, "People Laugh," an attack against what members see as 
the public's callousness toward the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
The song, which has had limited release at college radio stations, is from the 
band's debut album, "Venice," which came out in March. The album, according to 
lead singer Kipp Lennon, hasn't sold well because the band, until now, hasn't 
had a single getting significant airplay. He said the proceeds of the single 
will be donated to the Warwick Foundation, an AIDS education group. 
</P>
<P>
The band, which will tour the Pacific Northwest in coming weeks, hopes the new 
single will be a big career boost. "We want to open up for a headliner band," 
Lennon said. "Headliners are looking these days for someone who can help them 
fill the seats; they can't always do it alone. One song could put us out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The premiere issue of Country Music Video Magazine, a nationwide roundup of 
country entertainment, will feature seven minutes from the Valley's weekly Barn 
Dance concerts held Tuesdays at the Palomino in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, a one-hour video featuring live performances, reviews and 
interviews, recorded the Ricky Nelson tribute held at the Barn Dance in May. 
Among the Nelson songs performed by other artists that evening were "Hello, 
Mary Lou" and "Poor Little Fool." 
</P>
<P>
"We picked that night," said Laurie Kaye, the magazine's editor, "because he 
had such a huge country following, and we knew there would be a lot of people 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Kaye said the Barn Dance concerts, hosted by Ronnie Mack, remain the focus of 
country music in California. She said the next magazine, due to be released in 
November, will also feature segments from Barn Dance.

D.A. WIDENS INVESTIGATION OF CITY HALL; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDORA: NEARLY FINISHED CHECKING ON CITY'S DEALINGS WITH INSURANCE FIRM 
CO-OWNED BY THE MAYOR, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DIGS DEEPER.

<P>
The district attorney's office, which had planned to complete an investigation 
this month into the city's insurance practices, has expanded its inquiry to 
consider other alleged improprieties at City Hall, authorities said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors declined to reveal any details of the investigation but said they 
are looking into at least two complaints separate from their original review of 
the city's dealings with an insurance firm co-owned by Mayor Bob Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that happens when you start digging and talking to 
people," Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Wenke said. "It just sort of expanded. . . . 
You bring up one matter and they bring up other topics." 
</P>
<P>
Wenke, however, cautioned against reading anything into the probe or 
speculating on who might be the target. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether there's any merit to these additional complaints, I don't know," he 
said. "It's so sketchy at this point. All I can tell you is that it doesn't 
relate to the Kuhn insurance incident at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn is being investigated by prosecutors to determine if his ties to Alandale 
Insurance Agency, which has done more than $125,000 in business with the city 
since Kuhn joined the City Council in 1986, posed a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who has denied any wrongdoing, has abstained from voting on at least 
13 payments to Alandale, a firm in which he holds more than a two-thirds 
interest. A review of records by The Times in May, however, showed that he 
voted to approve payments to the firm on at least three other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the council has voted to obtain coverage from a different insurance 
broker, and the state Fair Political Practices Commission has found no evidence 
that Kuhn acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is ridiculous," said City Manager Art Cook, adding that he had 
not been informed of the new allegations. "It's like anybody can file a 
complaint . . . and all of a sudden they come knocking on your door." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, which indicated that it was close to completing 
its review of Kuhn, decided to hold off on a final report and conclude the 
entire investigation at one time.

Have you been contemplating the artistic potential of your toaster? Got an urge 
to spout some poetic couplets? Want to paint a fence? You can do all this and 
more during a month of festivities in Claremont, where they're putting on the 
Fourth Annual Fringe of the Fringe Arts Festival, starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 events, to be held from Pomona to Riverside and points in 
between, are scheduled for the festival, which runs through Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The Fringe of the Fringe got its start three years ago as an offshoot of the 
Los Angeles Fringe Festival, which was originally organized as an artistic 
component of the 1984 L.A. Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Fringe Festival is now known as the Open Festival, running as 
an adjunct to the Los Angeles Festival. Got that? See related listings, JX. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not enough venues for artists in this area so we really wanted to 
bring some events here," explained Marlene Pou, a board member of Pomona's DA 
Gallery, the nonprofit arts organization that sponsors the Fringe of the Fringe 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony on Saturday begins 
</P>
<P>
with a mask parade in which artists create moving, noise-making sculptures that 
will frolic around Claremont's Memorial Park, starting at 8th Avenue and Indian 
Hill Boulevard at noon. The day will continue with music, airborne art such as 
kites and balloons, performance art, puppetry in the park and a 40-foot-long 
fence mural that the public is invited to paint. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 22, people are invited to bring household objects, such as the 
aforementioned toaster, to the DA Gallery in the afternoon and help transform 
them into objets d'art for exhibit that night. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, at the Huntley Bookstore in Claremont, there will be a "Night of 
Full Moon Madness" during which 100 poets will take turns reading short 
selections from their work. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically throughout the festival, 28 local artists, including Michael 
Woodcock of Claremont, will open their homes and studios to tours. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the events are free, but some have small admission fees, Pou said. For 
a schedule of all the events, write the DA Gallery at 244 1/2 S. Garey Ave., 
Pomona, 91766 or call (714) 397-9716. KAREN E. KLEIN

ALTADENA TOWN HALL WAITS FOR A HOME

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its peeling wallpaper, yellowed curtains, smoke-stained fireplaces and 
maze of upstairs bedrooms bearing the strewn-about belongings of a half-dozen 
student tenants, the Hawkins House fits its motto -- "A Dream in the Making." 
</P>
<P>
While others may see just a worn, 99-year-old house, the Altadena Town Hall 
Board of Directors sees a future. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks pretty awful, but I think we can do a lot with it," said board 
President Geri Gauthier, as she stood inside the Hawkins House last week and 
enthusiastically pointed at empty rooms. 
</P>
<P>
As she talked, visions formed of offices, a community theater, meeting rooms, 
heritage and historical museums, and a chamber of commerce headquarters office. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, Gauthier and her 15-member board have promoted that 
vision, raising $100,000 toward relocating and converting the Victorian home 
into a town hall. The fund raising has been done mainly on a one-on-one basis, 
Gauthier said, because the unincorporated community of 42,000 lacks an official 
focal point or town center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the town hall will do -- unify the community," Gauthier said. 
</P>
<P>
But the group faces an Oct. 31 deadline by which they must raise an additional 
$200,000 and move the house. The developer, Nottingham Ltd. of West Covina, 
which donated the 6,000-square-foot structure to the Altadena community, needs 
to give away the house by that date in order to take advantage of tax breaks, 
said Jonathan Webb, a Nottingham official. 
</P>
<P>
Nottingham plans to build seven condominiums and a commercial building on the 
1.47-acre lot now occupied by the house. Construction on the condominiums is 
expected to begin this winter, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has pledged $20,000 toward the fund-raising effort, but $100,000 
that was expected from developers Cantwell Anderson, builders of the unrelated 
La Vina housing project, has been in limbo ever since La Vina opponents 
succeeded in stopping that project by filing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were almost there on our original (fund-raising) plan, but because of the 
litigation, we don't know what will happen," said Patricia Bunin, town hall 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
With the $100,000 raised so far, the town hall group has enough money to pay 
for moving the house and placing it on blocks at the new site a mile away on El 
Molino Avenue, between the county sheriff and fire stations. There, under a 
low-cost lease from the county, it will be refurbished by volunteer efforts, 
Gauthier said. 
</P>
<P>
But the town hall group wants to ensure that the house is functional after the 
move. The $200,000 would be used for a foundation at the new site needed to 
convert the house's basement into a 250-person capacity ground-floor theater 
and change the house from two stories to three, architect George Fulks said. 
The new foundation would also take care of much of the earthquake safety work 
needed on the structure, he said. In addition, the money would fund electric 
and water connections. 
</P>
<P>
The town hall group hopes to raise the money by the deadline by finding 
"founders" willing to donate $1,000 each and by holding a public event to 
gather smaller donations. "We're optimistic," Bunin said.

MALL SITE A BURIAL GROUND, INDIANS CLAIM; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: WHITTIER HAS AGREED TO HIRE AN EXPERT TO EXAMINE THE TRACT 
EARMARKED FOR A $20-MILLION SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whittier officials said they will ask an archeologist to examine the site of a 
proposed $20-million shopping center to see whether it contains an Indian 
burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
An archeological find in the vicinity of the abandoned Southern Pacific train 
depot could stall and even endanger a commercial project that the city has 
planned for 12 years and floated $7 million in bonds to help finance. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying by two Indians prompted the city's move. The 16-acre triangular site, 
about a mile east of the San Gabriel River Freeway, is the likely location of 
an Indian burial ground and should rest undisturbed, said Jimi Castillo and 
Lupe Lopez, cousins-in-law who trace their ancestry to Southern California 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
After initial surprise and skepticism, the city is taking the issue seriously 
and has invited an Irvine environmental firm, LSA Associates, to bid on an 
archeological study of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of further delays comes just as the shopping center cleared two 
major hurdles. At its Tuesday meeting, the city's Redevelopment Agency approved 
the building and landscaping design. 
</P>
<P>
Next, agency members unanimously approved a proposal that will settle, for the 
time being, the issue of what to do with the 100-year-old depot on the site. 
The station, a national historic landmark, will be moved to a Penn Street lot 
owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. Leasing the land will cost the city $700 a 
year; moving the depot will cost $34,730. Many preservationists who lobbied to 
save the depot have said they accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Cunningham, the city's assistant city manager for community development, 
said he hopes the city can also resolve the burial ground issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication of any historic or archeological artifacts on the 
site," he said. "And we base that on two previous evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the UCLA Archeological Information Center surveyed its archival 
collection of published accounts and records and found no mention of a village 
or burial ground at the depot site. Whittier commissioned the first study when 
it targeted the Whittier Boulevard area for redevelopment in 1978. The second 
study was part of a street-widening project near the Whittier Quad shopping 
area earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, a large archeological site doesn't escape the eyes of archeologists 
and researchers," said Brian Glenn, the center's acting coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not documented any remains at that location. That doesn't mean they 
don't exist. It simply means that whatever documentation is available is not on 
file at our office." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn noted that the depot vicinity had been a highly developed commercial and 
residential area for years and that an earlier site could have been destroyed 
without proper documentation before preservation became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more names of villages than we have places located," he said. "A great 
number of villages are probably fully destroyed under Los Angeles. But there's 
also an excellent chance that some sites are preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 53 and a Gabrielino Indian who lives in South Whittier, said she has 
documentary evidence supporting her belief that one such Indian burial ground 
lies under or near the depot. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez turned to page 210 of a 1978 edition of "Chinigchinich," a book little 
known outside of Indian and archeological circles. 
</P>
<P>
The title refers to the name of a prophet figure for the local tribes, 
anthropology consultant Chester King said. 
</P>
<P>
The book's author was missionary Geronimo Boscana. More than 150 years ago, 
Father Boscana, writing in Spanish, recorded his observations of the "beliefs, 
usages, customs and extravagancies" of local Indians. His notes were translated 
into English and published in 1846. 
</P>
<P>
Later, ethnographer John Harrington, starting about 1913, annotated Boscana's 
work. One such note refers to an Indian burial ground: 
</P>
<P>
"In the vicinity of the Southern Pacific junction tower, which stands in the 
western angle of the crossing of the Whittier spur of the Southern Pacific with 
the Santa Fe Railway, there is another Indian graveyard. A Mr. Cooper tried to 
make a cesspool there and found the ground full of Indian bones." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Castillo believe that Whittier's depot is what the text calls the 
Southern Pacific junction tower. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials, based on UCLA research, disagreed, placing the possible 
burial ground south of Whittier, in the northern part of Santa Fe Springs. That 
section of Santa Fe Springs contains a few houses, a sandwich stand and 
industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Powell, city manager of Santa Fe Springs, said he cannot recall 
construction in that area that would have required deep excavation. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, like Lopez, places little faith in expert opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials "kept telling me they would go ahead with the development," 
Castillo said. "I decided to come forward and protect my ancestors' burial 
sites. According to our faith, the development would disturb the spirits of our 
ancestors, which in turn would disturb the spirits of the living." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, 47, an unemployed cabinetmaker, said he only recently began studying 
his Indian heritage after a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that he said 
wrecked his marriage and separated him from his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been sober," the Whittier native said, "I've been getting back into 
my culture and everything." 
</P>
<P>
He recently entered the depot site, he said, to conduct a religious ceremony 
that involved burning sweet grass and sage. "I felt a spiritual belonging, 
almost a feeling of being at home. I looked behind my left boot, and there 
lying on the ground was a tail feather of a red-tailed hawk, which I believe 
was a sign." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials have privately expressed skepticism about the burial 
ground, wondering whether the issue represented a last-ditch effort by 
activists who opposed moving the depot or disliked the shopping center project. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo acknowledged sympathy with residents who want the depot to stay put: 
"I am for preserving history. I would prefer to see the depot refurbished where 
it sits, and perhaps plant some green grass around it, and put in walkways and 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Jeanette McKenna, a supporter of Castillo's efforts, has also 
opposed moving the depot and approving the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the (shopping center) design reflects the community of 
Whittier," she said. "It doesn't reflect a small Quaker town. It's more 
designed for an open area of Orange County, with lots of stucco and blank wall 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the developer, Encino-based Urbatec, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If remains are found, the first person with jurisdiction is the county coroner, 
who would make sure that the corpse is not recent. The coroner would then 
contact the Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento, which would 
search for what it terms "the most likely descendants." 
</P>
<P>
There are about five such designated Gabrielino descendants in Los Angeles 
County. Castillo is one of up to 3,000 identified Gabrielinos in Southern 
California who do not yet have that designation. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielino Indians got their name from their close association with the San 
Gabriel Mission. Their most direct ancestors may have migrated here up to 3,000 
years ago, said anthropological consultant King, whose dissertation work was on 
local tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mission era in the late 1700s, he said, there was about one Indian 
village per six square miles in the Los Angeles Basin. Communities ranged from 
15 to 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
He also estimates that there was a stable population of 3,000 Gabrielino 
Indians until diseases imported by colonists decimated them. 
</P>
<P>
The missionaries turned the Indians, who were hunter/gatherers, into farmers 
and cattle herders, King said, adding that Indians were pressed to leave behind 
native cultural practices and abandon villages and burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said: "Rather than be known as Indians, which at the time was lower than 
dirt, they became Mexican or Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there was not much respect for Indian burial grounds either, 
said Larry Myers, the executive secretary of the state's Native American 
Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian burial grounds were not treated the same as other burial grounds. 
There's been a tremendous amount of desecration," he said, not only by 
developers but by museums that have collected Indian bones. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, it is a felony to willfully destroy Indian remains in a 
burial site. Most often, descendants reach a compromise with a developer to 
relocate the bones, bury them deeper at the site or build around them.

So Jose Menendez was an overachiever, had great charm, intense drive and 
ambition, a need for excellence and perfection and tried to instill these 
traits in his children as well as control their destinies. For years we have 
read how these same traits made old Joe Kennedy's dream of having a son sworn 
in as President possible, but Johnson and Soble seem to think that same 
single-mindedness drove Menendez' children to murder him. 
</P>
<P>
So Lyle went on a spending spree after his parents' deaths, and that should be 
sufficient proof of his guilt. As someone who has experienced when young the 
death of a parent, fortunately for me in less dramatic circumstances, I know 
children grieve differently, as when my brother tried to bury his pain at the 
death of the mother he adored by attending, or throwing, as many parties as he 
could fit in a day, or my sister seemed to think it necessary to be reassured 
of her family's love at every waking moment, or I myself retreated and for 
months afterwards thought I hated everyone who had a mother. 
</P>
<P>
So the police have found a manuscript written by Erik relating a similar crime, 
and this too should convince us of his guilt. As a would-be writer I have 
written manuscripts based on many subjects, and I now shudder to think what 
would happen if, God forbid, any child close to me should suffer an accident, 
would my novel based on child abuse convince the police of my culpability? 
</P>
<P>
I think a person who is capable of not only killing his parents but blowing off 
his mother's face, knows no loyalty, and would never have flown back home to 
surrender after his brother was arrested as Erik did.

In 1985, an 18-year-old Calabasas High School student, from a prominent 
Calabasas family, gunned down a schoolmate during a brief, uncharacteristic and 
emotionally difficult time in both young men's lives. Both of these 
high-society kids met with circumstances they were unable to deal with -- and 
both resorted to violence. 
</P>
<P>
The final outcome was a tragedy for all involved. The Times reported the story 
as in unfolded with many front-page and front Metro page stories. The Times 
kept an unbiased viewpoint and simply reported. That 18-year-old was me, and I 
have now been in prison for over five years, serving a 17-years-to-life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in 1990, two high-society kids, also from Calabasas of late, have been 
charged with the murder of their parents. However, the differences in the 
reporting styles now and then are immense. It is appalling that The Times has 
decided to become judge, jury and executioner for these two young men. 
Reporters Johnson and Soble have unequivocally pronounced these two young men 
guilty as charged. The reporting style fails entirely in any attempt to 
maintain objectivity and has, in fact, taken on the clear tone of a 
prosecutor's closing arguments -- inherently biased monologues which often 
stray wildly from fact. 
</P>
<P>
In the interest of justice, I urge you to reconsider your reporting tactics in 
this case and to report the facts as fact and speculation as speculation, but 
keep in mind the difference.

Lyle and Erik Menendez came of age in a society that worshiped material excess 
from the crib. If you didn't have everything you wanted by the time you reached 
puberty, you were a failure. 
</P>
<P>
They and their spoiled, brat-pack friends drove $50,000 cars before they could 
shave; cribbed someone else's arduously written school papers or had their 
mothers write them; spent more on clothes in a month than whole families spend 
for food and shelter in a year; dated glamorous 30-year-old models; dined in 
the best restaurants. In short, as teen-agers they had the good life many of us 
strive for but rarely reach, even if we live to 100. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we have-nots are in the long run the richer. For these young victims 
are as impoverished and needy as the lowliest Calcutta street beggar. The 
animal imagery, the driving force behind their father's success, became twisted 
and bent in the next generation. But Jose paid his dues before becoming king of 
the jungle he lived in. His sons, perhaps borrowing a page from recent history, 
wanted to be lionized without experiencing the necessary but humbling years as 
cubs. It took but a few minutes to kill their parents and they would have it 
all now. 
</P>
<P>
How many more needless crimes of avarice before this nation returns to some 
good old but recently maligned Yankee horse sense and values?

I just read the smug letter by Lorraine Evans (Viewers' Views, Aug. 19) 
regarding the TV commercial for Secure Horizons. 
</P>
<P>
I had seen the commercial many times but paid no attention to it until January, 
1986. Then I listened, acted and received the information from the company. You 
have no idea what Secure Horizons has meant to us and still does.

<P>
Lorraine, don't be so smug. That commercial has been a blessing financially to 
hundreds of senior citizens.

Lauren Lipton's "Anchored in L.A." piece on Aug. 5 was a good story. 
</P>
<P>
All of the news anchors listed were A-OK. Some were better than others, but all 
very acceptable. Among the women, Bree Walker of KCBS has warmth, knowledge and 
looks. Among the men, we like Paul Moyer, Jim Lampley, John Beard and Keith 
Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
As for the morning shows, we don't like Bryant "Grumble" and can't stand 
Deborah Norville of NBC's "Today." Poor chemistry.

The Puzzler has changed. I'm not sure when it started -- it's been some time --

The Puzzler used to provide a goodly dose of personal satisfaction upon its

a battle of wits, it has become an exercise in deciphering the lame puns of its 
creators.

Most officers hate tow-away calls more than anything. They waste a great deal 
of time waiting for the tow truck to arrive and for the information to reach 
them covering the vehicle, and then the "dreaded" report to do. Contrary to 
public belief there are no Brownie points for this.

Place the blame where it belongs -- not on the shoulders of the officers.

RECORD RACK: COLOURFUL ANTHEMS TO BLACK-ROCK MOVEMENT *** 1/2 LIVING COLOUR 
"TIME'S UP" EPIC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A 
CLASSIC).

"Elvis Is Dead" trumpets the gleeful, attention-getting track on this second 
album from the hard-driving leaders of the black-rock movement. Well, so are 
Malcolm X and Jimi Hendrix, but that doesn't stop them from being big 
influences on this group. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't stop Elvis either -- the frenzied abandon with which this 
quartet often plays can be traced in part back to the Pelvis himself. The point 
of the song, which does acknowledge Elvis as a great performer, is that he was 
just the first white rock apostle -- it's certainly no coincidence that the 
song locomotes along to a metalized James Brown riff. So it's no surprise that 
in "Solace of You," when Corey Glover sings "Gotta go inside, back where it 
started," he means Africa, a point confirmed by the song's South 
African-inspired township jive shuffle and Mandela-inspired message. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a black-rock manifesto? It is, as was the band's 1988 debut album, 
"Vivid." But thanks to matured songwriting and that frenzied abandon 
(highlighting Vernon Reid's jazz-informed metal-master guitar heroics) it's 
much more than that: a rousing collection that rocks hard and rolls poetically, 
and that will be best appreciated by the colorblind -- but not the colourblind.

Half of "Tangled" is slick and over-sweet. The former Go-Go does much better 
when setting her fragile, Cyndi Lauper sound-alike voice in more intimate 
ballad surroundings. Wiedlin also excels in two anthems that engage broad 
themes of war and freedom with emotional acuity. Why not make every song 
matter? MIKE BOEHM

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 ANTHRAX "PERSISTENCE OF TIME" ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthrax has always been the least apocalyptic of new-metal bands, obsessed with 
Mad magazine instead of the post-nuclear battlefield; playing at a spare, 
crunching walk where the competition screeches through warp-speed 
diminished-seventh chords. They've been the first in the genre to accommodate 
outside influences, too, from hip-hop to power pop to hard-core punk. 
</P>
<P>
(Anthrax's biggest hit, "I'm the Man," is basically a rap song.) 
</P>
<P>
Here, Anthrax use the bricks of their sound to construct something different, 
way closer to the dissonant post-punk of Gang of Four or Fugazi than to the 
death spew of Sodom or Vio-Lence. 
</P>
<P>
The title song might be the first mature speed-metal meditation on middle age, 
and "Blood" seems to be a full-on attempt at the fusion of metal and dub, with 
Anthrax's patented blocks of pitched white noise taking the backbeat. The 
lyrics are heavily anti-racist, anti-hatred, pro-togetherness. And the Joe 
Jackson cover even fits in. "Persistence of Time" is more or less an art album 
within the context of Anthrax, and a small masterpiece of metal. JONATHAN GOLD

*** GEORGE MICHAEL "LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOL. 1" COLUMBIA: ALBUMS ARE RATED 
ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

Parts of this somber, ballad-heavy album play as a sort of apologia for the 
pop/soul superstar's previous recordings and videos, where his considerable 
craft was overshadowed by an oft-mocked sexy pinhead persona. 
</P>
<P>
"When you shake your ass? / They notice fast / And some mistakes were built to 
last," he sings in "Freedom '90" (an old Wham! song with new, pointedly updated 
lyrics), in apparent prediction that his derriere-wiggling days will forever 
leave extreme prejudice in the hearts and minds of his most ardent detractors. 
</P>
<P>
That's followed by a promise: "There's something deep inside of me / There's 
someone I forgot to be." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your preconceptions about Michael, "Listen" -- some self-seriousness 
aside -- is an impressive piece of work in which Michael's rich feel for 
melodies and instinctively perfect production skills have finally met up with 
songs that have the ring of personal, not commercial, passion. 
</P>
<P>
With only a couple of vaguely danceable cuts in earshot, and an emphasis on 
Elton John-ish mournful ballads, the album's two major themes -- regret over 
career to date, regret over a lost love -- are indeed enormously self-absorbed 
but ring with a conviction that isn't negligible. And when he sings "All we 
have to do now / Is take these lies and make them true somehow," he speaks 
eloquently for any artist who ever found himself grappling for something 
meaningful to say well after superstardom has set in. This isn't a bad start. 
Apologia accepted. CHRIS WILLMAN

A TRIP FROM STARK TO CHIC TO EXOTIC; 
</P>
<P>
FROM BISTRO 201'S OUTSIDE TO ITS INSIDE TO ITS FOOD, DAVID WILHELM GOES UPSCALE 
WITH A VENGEANCE IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we last saw David Wilhelm, he was creating Southwestern oeuvres in his 
arty Laguna restaurant, Kachina. He's the chef who created the original Newport 
Beach version of what has turned into the El Torito G-R-I-L-L. Now he has gone 
quintessentially Orange County and opened a dazzler of a restaurant smack in 
the middle of an office complex. 
</P>
<P>
And what a complex: It's a maze, a grid of office buildings east of John Wayne 
Airport. You could even find Bistro 201, Wilhelm's hot new restaurant, and not 
know where you are. The restaurant sign is so small -- according to Irvine city 
regulations -- that you have to squint to see it. 
</P>
<P>
You walk up to a nondescript door that looks like the entrance to an ultra-chic 
office building. It's so quiet here you can almost hear the discreet hum of the 
air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
When you pull on the heavy glass door, you have no clue as to the drama that is 
about to unfold. From the moment you stride past the zinc-topped bar -- all raw 
metal, blond wood and sharp, angular corners -- your evening is being 
orchestrated in a surprisingly clear pattern: from stark to chic to splendid. 
</P>
<P>
Just past the bar is the main dining room, a place of high ceilings and 
sculpted, inlaid walls. Soft Diva lights perch on wires above lush booths 
upholstered in raw silk; at the same time, 12-foot-high wooden slats suggest a 
Japanese temple. If you want, you can continue in a beeline to the more 
intimate patio, where a little forest of bamboo shields tables that are 
shadowed by giant canvas umbrellas. The place is positively overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
So are the people who dine here. This is simply great people-watching 
territory, because Irvine makes such an unapologetic show of its affluence. 
Everyone is here to see and be seen, in formal evening wear and stunning 
designer fashions. At Bistro 201, the sideways glance becomes an art form. 
</P>
<P>
The food is even more avant-garde than the surroundings. Often Wilhelm's dishes 
are like a David Lynch movie: creative to the point of self-indulgence. They 
are so exotic you are surprised they're not served in tiny, precious portions a 
la nouvelle cuisine. The menu refers to appetizers as "small plates" and main 
dishes as "large plates" but the conceit is misleading -- all the portions here 
are huge, unqualifiedly huge. 
</P>
<P>
In another unusual turn of affairs, the first course is actually the least 
satisfying. Grilled shrimp on creamy polenta with roasted peppers has a 
Southwestern flair that Wilhelm knows all about: The shrimp are slightly 
blackened and served on a bed of creamy, bright yellow polenta, while the 
peppers are pureed to a verdant green and a red salsa is drizzled on top. But 
you don't eat color. The shrimp is bland and the polenta is apt to be mushy. 
</P>
<P>
Other appetizers have unexpected problems too. Cold smoked filet of beef, 
served in attractive rounds with an onion marmalade, has an unpleasant cutting 
flavor; perhaps the hardwoods used in the smoking process need to be 
reevaluated. Lobster cakes with basil sauce and corn relish sound absolutely 
irresistible, but the aromatic flavor of the basil mutes the taste of the 
lobster, and the corn relish has a sharp flavor, as if slightly fermented. 
</P>
<P>
You're better off trying the more straightforward appetizers. Forest mushrooms 
and hickory smoked ham in brioche is delicious (despite the apparent absence of 
any ham). The mushrooms come in an intense cream sauce that you will long for 
more of. Caesar salad with herbed croutons is the strong-and-not-so-silent 
type, with a wonderful bite and a fresh crispness to its greens, mostly romaine 
lettuce. The steamed clams with leeks, garlic and mashed potatoes are fine too; 
the lumpy mashed potatoes are the very best thing this restaurant serves. And I 
should mention the complimentary tapenade, a rich suspension like an aioli with 
olives mixed in. It's impossible to stop eating. 
</P>
<P>
The main courses are pretty consistent, ranging from the mundane (bistro burger 
-- the only thing even remotely bistro-like about this place) to the bizarre 
(grilled swordfish with pesto and apricot relish). Muscovy duck with Michigan 
sun-dried sour cherry sauce is a solid choice. The duck is tender and gamy, 
charred black around the edges for extra complexity, and the sauce works like a 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
Something the restaurant calls rustic noodles are a pleasant surprise: eggless 
noodles shaped like pappardelle (flat, wide and wavy), crisped up in a pan and 
served with smoked chicken, mushrooms and herbs. Best of all is one of the most 
nearly traditional things Wilhelm serves, roast pork served on apples with a 
green peppercorn sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Do try the summer vegetable plate, a symphonically orchestrated platter of up 
to 12 wonderful baby vegetables from the Chino Ranch. You can expect squash 
blossoms, fennel, an excellent potato gratin among them. However, do not try 
things with fruit butters, relishes or sauces that sound too weird to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert is the best course of all. There are, among other things, a masterful 
souffle made from Belgian chocolate that explodes with chocolatey richness in 
your mouth and a sumptuous apple and blackberry cobbler with homemade vanilla 
ice cream. The star is raspberry brioche bread pudding, a feathery-light 
concoction whose taste belies its sinfully rich composition. Better still is 
the cappuccino, one of the best cups of coffee I have ever tasted. 
</P>
<P>
As you walk out, pick up one of the restaurant's spiffy Rolodex business cards. 
The fax number is printed neatly on the bottom. That'll make it easy for you to 
reserve a table directly from the office. 
</P>
<P>
Have the restaurant fax you some directions while you're at it.

ZAN THOMPSON: LOST IN THE SHUFFLE BETWEEN 2 COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't think counties talk to each other. At least, Los Angeles County and 
Riverside County seem to have a prickly relationship. 
</P>
<P>
When I lived in Pasadena, I had a property tax deduction on my Linda Vista 
house that I thought was because of Proposition 13. Now, I am told it is 
propositions 60 to 90. Do you suppose that means that one proposition has been 
supplanted by 31? Surely not, although counties do seem to like paper a lot. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Riverside tax collector's office some weeks ago and spent the day 
listening to a busy signal. Then I called the Los Angeles tax collector's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of recordings, none of which was applicable, I finally reached a 
lady named Josie Gonzales. I asked her for a copy of my tax bill for Linda 
Vista that Riverside wanted, along with a copy of my driver's license or birth 
certificate. For one ecstatic moment, I thought they might be planning a 
birthday party to welcome me to the county, but I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
Josie sent me a copy of my last tax bill, showing that I had paid half of the 
bill and that the people who bought my house had paid the other half. I bundled 
it up and sent it to the people in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
After some days I received a letter from Tonia Bealer saying they must have a 
copy of my most recent tax bill, which I had already sent them. "We need to see 
the assessed valuation of the former property that is shown on the regular tax 
bill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I had no such paper, having sent the perforated part, along with my check, to 
Los Angeles County. But remembering that Tom Swift was not dismayed (I had 
always wondered what was the matter with the dolt), I started all over again. 
</P>
<P>
First, I called the tax collector in Los Angeles County and heard a recorded 
message repeated many times. The county seemed to use the same kinds of 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles one kept saying, "Please stay on the line. An operator is being 
dialed to assist you." 
</P>
<P>
After 12 repetitions, my spirits were beginning to flag, and I was beginning to 
have the teensiest doubt that anyone was being dialed to assist me. Under and 
over the record, a reggae beat was playing. 
</P>
<P>
I hung up and called again and waited a long time and heard a human voice. It 
was more startling than an encounter of the third kind. 
</P>
<P>
My mouth was dry and I stammered, "Can I speak to Josie Gonzales?" 
</P>
<P>
I did get to speak to Josie, who told me I needed to speak to Trudy. I spoke to 
Trudy, who told me I should speak to Emma and gave me a telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
I started to dial again, went through the entire thing, the recording, the 
reggae, and finally reached Emma. She said she didn't know why I had been given 
her number. I told her I didn't either, but I guessed that the other women were 
just getting rid of me. 
</P>
<P>
Then Emma said, "But I handle unsecured property." 
</P>
<P>
That sounded promising, so I asked her what kind. She said, "Boats and 
airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
I began to wonder if I had inadvertently bought a boat or an airplane instead 
of a house. Emma was nice and patient and said, "I'll tell you what to do. I'll 
give you a number and if you can reach Tricia Ewell or Tyrone Hunt, they will 
be able to help you." 
</P>
<P>
I wished Emma a happy life and thanked her extravagantly, which she deserved, 
sitting there with all those unsecured boats and airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
I called the number Emma had given me and reached Tricia Ewell. She was 
delightful and listened to my story -- which I had almost ceased to believe 
myself. I told her I needed something that showed the value of the Linda Vista 
house. 
</P>
<P>
She told me that she did not have the bills but would send me a Certificate of 
Payment from the County of Los Angeles with the assessed valuation. I received 
it in a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
I will send all the stuff off again today and pray that Tonia Bealer accepts 
the valuation. If that isn't what she wants, I don't know what to do next. I do 
not want to talk to anyone except Tricia Ewell, deputy tax collector for Los 
Angeles County, and Tonia Bealer, office assistant in the Proposition 60-90 
Section in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all this, I sent the Riverside property tax office a check for 
$532.07. Tonia says that if all goes well, I will get that money back in maybe 
six months because they only have two people working in that section. Oh, dear.

<P>
THEATRE REPERE'S MULTILINGUAL 'DRAGONS' TRILOGY' IS A POETIC LOOK AT THE 
COLLISION OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN KELLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Dragons' Trilogy" suddenly became topical this year. Writer-director 
Robert Lepage and the Quebec City troupe Theatre Repere created the sprawling, 
epic play five years ago -- long before the current wave of tension between 
French- and English-speaking people that has shaken Canada's political 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
That often uneasy relationship is at the heart of "The Dragons' Trilogy." It 
starts off in Quebec City's Chinatown during the Depression, but the complex, 
experimental work isn't really about the setting. Chinatown is where the 
English and French meet, and its image is the catalyst for a poetic look at the 
collision of French and English cultures, complete with a guided tour of 
20th-Century Canada, with pit-stops in 1930s Quebec, World War II Toronto, and 
present-day Vancouver. Multilingual pieces are Theatre Repere's trademark, and 
there is English, French and Chinese dialogue in the production. 
</P>
<P>
The linguistic melting pot is certainly a factor in the play's phenomenal 
success. The show's 200th performance will take place during its monthlong run 
at UCLA's Freud Amphitheater starting Friday as part of the Los Angeles 
Festival. The play has packed houses in Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto, 
Chicago, London, Paris, Barcelona, and Adelaide, Australia. Repere has been 
touring the show on and off for the past five years, and they've amassed an 
impressive stack of rave reviews from newspapers around the world, including 
the Times of London, which called "The Dragons' Trilogy" "a masterpiece." 
</P>
<P>
It's an extraordinary track record for a challenging, loosely structured play 
created by a small, avant-garde theater company from Quebec City. It's been 
popular since Day One. But it only became controversial this year, due to the 
renewed political feuding in Canada in the aftermath of the failure of the 
Meech Lake Accord last June. (The deal was to bring Quebec back into the 
Canadian constitutional family, but it fell apart just before the self-imposed 
June 23 deadline.) 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lepage is the director of "The Dragons' Trilogy," one of the authors of 
the collective creation and the main man behind Theatre Repere. The 32-year-old 
Quebec City native is considered the boy wonder of Quebec theater. He is a 
prolific writer, director, and actor (he plays Pontius Pilate in the movie 
"Jesus of Montreal"), and he's had major success with Repere and on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Lepage was dismayed when "The Dragons' Trilogy" became a victim of anti-French 
bigotry in Western Canada this summer. During its run in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
there were threats of a boycott, audience members walked out on the play and 
shouted insults during the performances. All because the play is partly in 
French. The version in L.A. will be approximately two-thirds English, one-third 
French. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a victim of this misunderstanding," said Lepage, in a recent 
interview. "I have the same opinion as a lot of people in Quebec. I'm very 
shocked by English Canada's reaction to Quebec, by the manifestation of hatred. 
Of course, it fuels the separatist in me. But I think there's a lot of 
misunderstanding on both sides in the post-Meech period. We have to be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
Lepage's willingness to fault both camps in the debate doesn't sit well with 
the more doctrinaire nationalists back home in Quebec. Lepage and Theatre 
Repere have taken criticism from the beginning for their willingness to 
incorporate English into their work. Their more international perspective was a 
break with traditional Quebec theater, and it led to criticism that the company 
was watering down Quebec culture to succeed outside the province. 
</P>
<P>
There will be more ammunition for the critics this fall, as Repere gears up for 
a 
</P>
<P>
serious assault on the English-speaking theater world. After the L.A. premiere 
of "The Dragons' Trilogy," the troupe heads to Glasgow for a Scottish 
co-production of "Tectonic Plates" -- the group's latest major piece -- and 
then the new work goes to London's National Theatre in December. In October, 
another set of actors from the company will present the American debut of the 
murder-mystery "Polygraphe" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Lepage believes they have made in-roads into the international scene without 
compromising their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am a nationalist," says Lepage. "But the nationalists think I'm 
fishy because I don't express my nationalism in an obvious way. 'The Dragons' 
Trilogy' is about the Canadian mosaic, but it's French-Canadian impressions. 
It's a very Quebec show. I think it is one of the most nationalist pieces ever 
written in Quebec theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly shows a very distinct society. It's very nationalist even if I'm 
very interested in English Canada. Maybe that's because I'm sure of my 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
"People were shocked because there was so much English in it. We answered that, 
of course, Quebec is a French province, but it is surrounded by English, and we 
use English a lot. We cannot pretend that we don't hear English on the street." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dragons' Trilogy" grapples with this cultural baggage using Repere's 
unique visual, stream-of-consciousness style. The central image is a parking 
lot where Quebec City's Chinatown once stood. Lepage has the uncanny ability of 
transforming ordinary objects into extraordinary images. The parking lot, the 
attendant's booth, a huge pile of sand and an array of props manage to stand in 
for a large slice of 20th-Century life in Canada. The parking lot cabin becomes 
a doctor's office, a Chinese laundry, a stairway and an airport gift shop. 
Shoeboxes become stores in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our work is visually explicit," says Lepage. "We use lots of body 
language. When we perform partly in French, people know the key words. People 
discover they know much more French than they think they know. Suddenly 
Americans understand French. The audience loves to feel intelligent. The idea 
of using that much French when we go to the U.S. is an interesting limitation. 
It's like traveling for the audience, and people love to travel." 
</P>
<P>
The central characters in "The Dragons' Trilogy" are two French-Canadian girls, 
Jeanne and Francoise, and it charts their lives from the 1930s to the present. 
For actress Marie Gignac -- who portrays Francoise, and has been with the show 
since its debut in Quebec City in 1985 -- the play's appeal is easily 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is simple to understand, but you go real deep into your emotions when 
you watch the show," says Gignac. "It's about love, tenderness, death, and 
tolerance between people from different ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
The original version of the play was three hours, but there is now an expanded 
six-hour version too. Both versions will be performed in Los Angeles. Lepage 
and his cast prefer the longer one, and, surprisingly, they insist the audience 
likes the epic format as well. 
</P>
<P>
"For six hours, people just sit here and they have the impression that they're 
part of a community," says Lepage. "Today, artists are into communication, not 
communion. 'Trilogy' has this sense of communion. It's a moving show. Nowadays, 
when people are moved by a movie or a TV program, there's always something 
fishy about it. Usually, you're trying to sell something. But there's no 
commercial trend attached to 'Trilogy.' There's a sense of ritual and community 
that you don't get at other events. It's a simple story, but it touches you in 
places that you're not used to being touched. People like to be told stories 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dragons' Trilogy" was the first show to put Theatre Repere on the map 
internationally. The group was founded in Quebec City in 1980, and Lepage 
joined two years later. He stepped down as artistic director last January to 
accept the prestigious post as artistic director of the French theater section 
at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, but he continues to work closely with 
Repere. 
</P>
<P>
Lepage's invents all his Repere plays collectively with the actors, using 
improvisation and other experimental methods. 
</P>
<P>
"For Lepage, the text is a point of departure," says Richard Frenchette, one of 
the actors in "The Dragons's Trilogy." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a sculptor working in the theater. Robert has a great ability to 
rediscover the meaning of objects and the meaning of language. He uses language 
like a theatrical object. He uses French, English, Italian, or Chinese like a 
chair." 
</P>
<P>
Lepage calls it "theater of exploration," and he feels it packs such an 
emotional punch because it deals in impressions not intellectual analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"We never start with an idea," says Lepage. "We always start with a resource, 
and that changes the whole process. If you start with an intellectual idea, 
you'll get into a lot of discussion. but we never do that. We start with a 
resource, which is something you can only have impressions about. Like a deck 
of cards or a parking lot. People give their impressions, and, suddenly, you 
see there's a line. Something comes out. The basic resource or metaphor for 
'The Dragons' Trilogy' was the parking lot and seeing all these footprints. You 
can imagine streets in Chinatown and, if you dig deep enough, you can imagine 
people being buried there."

THIS TIME, IT ISN'T ABOUT JOKES; 
</P>
<P>
WITH 'THE FIVE HEARTBEATS,' FILMMAKER ROBERT TOWNSEND LEAVES THE COMFORT OF 
COMEDY FOR A LOOK AT THE LIFE OF A '60S SOUL GROUP

Actor, comedian and filmmaker Robert Townsend grew up on the west side of 
Chicago in the 1960s listening to R&amp;B groups like the Temptations, the 
O'Jays and the Spinners. After the surprising success of his first movie, 
"Hollywood Shuffle," Townsend decided he wanted to make a movie about the rise 
of a '60s soul group -- a comedy, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Shuffle," which Townsend wrote with his partner and friend Keenan 
Ivory Wayans (the creator of Fox Television's popular comedy series "In Living 
Color"), was essentially a series of comedy sketches about the way blacks are 
portrayed in Hollywood films. Famous for being financed by its star-director's 
credit cards, the $100,000 production charmed critics and grossed $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the comedy script Townsend and Wayans began writing, "The Five Heartbeats," 
soon took an unexpected turn. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was going after pure comedy, but it took another shape," says 
Townsend. "I traveled on the road for a few months with an actual group from 
the '60s, the Dells, and heard their stories of being ripped off and taken 
advantaged of by people in the business. After spending time with that group I 
felt sad. I kept telling myself, it isn't about jokes, Robert, it isn't about 
jokes." 
</P>
<P>
The storyline of "The Five Heartbeats," in which Townsend acts as well as 
writes and directs, was altered to concentrate on the friendship of five black 
men from the same neighborhood. It follows them through the dramatic turns in 
their lives that come with the group's rapid success. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, they were just kids, they didn't know what was going on and they got 
taken advantage of because of it," said Townsend, wearing jeans and an MTV hat 
at a Sunset Strip health food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a story about friendship, and that can be one of the most difficult 
experiences to explore, much less write about. The story is a positive look at 
five young black men with an attempt to break away from any of the negative 
stereotypes that are tagged to us through the media," said Townsend. "Each 
character is totally different from the other. One might be what most people 
expect from the black male, while the others take you in completely different 
directions. I want to show people something that they haven't seen before -- 
not the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Making the transition from comedy to scenes of intense drama as an actor and 
director was difficult, admitted Townsend, but he feels it was a change he was 
ready to make. 
</P>
<P>
"This film is something I've had in mind for a while now, but there were a 
variety of things I wanted to do with the script, and those things took time to 
complete. In many ways this is the most difficult film I've made as an actor," 
said Townsend. "There are a lot of emotions in each scene that really pushed me 
as an artist, but I'd rather that than coming back with the same performance 
time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
Cast and crew on "Heartbeats" said Townsend artfully balanced the tasks of 
directing and starring as one of the Five Heartbeats. 
</P>
<P>
"He handled it well -- better than I thought possible," said Leon, who played 
the black biblical character in the controversial Madonna video "Like a 
Prayer." "Since we portray brothers in the film, we have a great many scenes 
together, which means I was very aware of how he adjusted to both roles. I have 
to give it to him -- he handled it like a pro, which made my job a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
Diahann Carroll stars as Eleanor, the wife of the group's manager. "After 
meeting Robert, I was attracted to him, his maturity and insightfulness. He 
made me immediately interested in his project," she said. "I was impressed by 
his gentle strength and commitment and wanted to know and see how he worked and 
what stimulated him. I enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
Leon, Harry J. Lennix, Tico Wells and Michael Wright are the remaining four 
Heartbeats. Harold Nicholas, of the legendary Nicholas Brothers dance team, 
also has a starring role as the group's choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend and the members of the Heartbeats spent weeks watching old tapes of 
performances by the O'Jays and Temptations. The group also performed around the 
Los Angeles area, even entering amateur-night talent shows to perfect their 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Those skills will come in handy once again as the the Heartbeats go on a 
promotional tour around the country before the film's release next February. 
</P>
<P>
But the story also moves beyond show business. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a scene where the girlfriend of one of the guys in the group gets 
pregnant and an abortion is considered," said Townsend. "The way this male 
character deals with it is with compassion and true concern. I hope that men 
who see the film will say, 'Hey that's the way a man deals with it and if that 
happens to me, that's the way I am going to deal with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
As a black filmmaker, said Townsend, "I feel total responsibility for what I am 
putting out there for people to see. That is one of the reasons I've taken time 
to make my second film, because I understand what effect films and movies have 
on peoples' lives. They affect the way we dress, comb our hair, even the way we 
decorate our living rooms. That's powerful stuff, and you have to treat it 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend says much of his imagination developed by watching a great deal of 
television in order to stay out of trouble while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching TV kept us inside and off the streets," he said. "Through watching 
television I was exposed to all types of influences, from Red Skelton to Sidney 
Poitier, which made my range of interest in entertainment just that varied." 
</P>
<P>
Loretha Williams, who is producing "Five Heartbeats" and also produced Spike 
Lee's "School Daze," said of Townsend, "He is probably one of the most directed 
and focused people I've ever met. The thought process he goes through when he 
is dealing with a project is really amazing. He has such a clear-cut vision in 
his mind of what he wants and accepts nothing less." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend says there were a variety of reasons for his three-year wait to make 
another film. 
</P>
<P>
Though there was a brief period in the early '70s when black films such as 
"Shaft," "Superfly" and "Cooley High" were commercially successful, the 
interest and development of predominantly black films, with the exception of 
"The Color Purple" and "A Soldier's Story," hit a long drought in the late '70s 
to early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
That drought ended with the emergence of director Spike Lee and Townsend's 
"Shuffle." But despite the critical success of Lee and the increased 
marketability of black-oriented films such as Eddie Murphy's "Coming to 
America," Townsend said he still had difficulty getting the deal he wanted for 
his second film. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a variety of offers for 'Heartbeats,' but I wasn't comfortable with 
them," he said. "And I heard a lot of people say, 'How dare Robert Townsend 
walk away from a studio,' 'How dare Townsend take his time.' But that's me, and 
I wasn't comfortable with what was being offered; it would have been like 
getting in bed with a stranger. My bottom line was I'll wait until I do my film 
the way I feel it should be done. I have a story to tell. Hopefully, people 
will listen when it gets done -- be it this year or six years from now." 
Townsend finally signed with 20th Century Fox to finance the $9-million film. 
</P>
<P>
Though Townsend, filmmakers Lee and Wayans (who also made the satire of 
"blaxploitation" movies "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"), and entertainers Eddie 
Murphy and Arsenio Hall have been warmly embraced by white audiences and, to 
some extent, the white film Establishment, there have been conflicts among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Hall disagreed hotly on Hall's late night talk show about Lee's 
criticism of Murphy for not pressuring Paramount, where Murphy has a long-term 
arrangement, to hire more blacks. Hall, who is a close friend of Murphy's, 
attacked Lee for going public with that accusation. (That rift was apparently 
mended a few weeks ago when Lee appeared on Hall's show a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend makes a conscious effort to distance himself from the verbal warfare. 
"For me it's not about blasting anyone," said Townsend, who directed Murphy in 
the concert film "Raw." "We are all out there doing what we can and that's what 
matters; the negative stuff isn't necessary. No, I may not agree with 
everything Spike does or Eddie does or Arsenio. But isn't up to me to agree 
with them. That's not my place. They are out there doing what they are doing 
and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend added that he was particularly dismayed over rumors that he and 
longtime pal Keenen Ivory Wayans were at odds with one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Keenen and I have been good friends and partners for years, and that hasn't 
changed," said Townsend. "He was originally set to be in the film before his 
show got picked up. That's why we aren't working together at this time and for 
no other reason. No one is happier than I am about the success of his show." 
</P>
<P>
The two currently have plans to co-write another film together sometime next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the works is a deal for Townsend to continue directing "Partners in 
Crime," an HBO showcase for new comedians from around the country that Townsend 
directs. He hopes to soon start a two-week workshop on filmmaking for 
inner-city children in large urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very important aspect of what I want to do, and that is giving back 
to the community," said Townsend. "Showing kids, particularly inner-city kids, 
that there are other things out there for them to do. That it is possible for 
them to become successful. I really don't think a lot of kids, particularly 
black kids, believe that." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said he was reminded of the need for such a program when he and a 
white casting director held auditions for "Heartbeats." "The both of us were 
sitting there and this kid begins to audition, but he was directing everything 
to the casting director as though I wasn't there," said Townsend. "It is that 
slave mentality that we as blacks have. We think that though we may be on the 
team, we can't be the quarterback. Unfortunately, that thought process sets in 
at a very early age. I want to work to see that change."

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: BACK TO THE SOURCE; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR MOVIES, FOUR BOOKS -- HOW THE ART OF LITERARY ADAPTATION WAS SERVED THIS 
SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adaptations have enriched Hollywood's bloodstream since the nickelodeons fed 
off the dime novel. In the '30s, Liberty magazine or Collier's or the Saturday 
Evening Post overflowed with stories by the first rank of American writers, 
virtually there for the taking. And the movies took them by the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
For more tony properties -- ones that could be counted on to bring Oscars for 
their casts and Thalbergs for their producers -- Hollywood reached to its 
bookshelves and pulled down inspiration willy-nilly, from "Gone With the Wind" 
and "Wuthering Heights" to "The Godfather" and "Out of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
We've gotten a little out of the habit of literary adaptations lately, ever 
since old movies became the literature of fascinated young filmmakers -- old 
movies, old television shows, old comic books. Recently it's new movies; 
blockbusters we hadn't even had a chance to forget were turned into sequels, 
each of them noisier, bloodier and less imaginative than the original. It's 
been some summer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it seems that the action-adventure sequel has cycled out, at least for 
the moment. And while we catch our breath in relief, a quartet of movies has 
made the summer more interesting, all of them from notable books: "Quick 
Change," "Presumed Innocent," "Wild At Heart" and "After Dark, My Sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Page to screen is a delicate matter. How much needs to be invented? How much 
infidelity to the original will readers stand for? How many memorable 
characters must be sacrificed to keep the narrative line going? These are a few 
of the questions four screenwriters faced as they brought these very different 
novels to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Quick Change's" author, Jay Cronley, possesses a cracked and wild humor, he 
draws real characters whose outlook is about a quarter-inch away from surreal. 
His wit is all the more pungent because his heroes are frequently outlaws; they 
may not brandish guns, but they are unquestionably outlaws of the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Cronley concocted a grand scheme for his "Quick Change" sweethearts, Grimm and 
Phyllis, and their dim cohort Lackey -- the film's Bill Murray, Geena Davis and 
Randy Quaid. The novel's trio gets away with its ingenious Manhattan bank 
robbery, just barely makes it through the city's everyday booby traps to the 
plane, gets fleeced en route to England and doggedly starts all over again. In 
Cronley's fatalistic view, it's a sort of tongue-in-cheek paean to American 
persistence. 
</P>
<P>
In the novel the three are definitely no better than they should be. Raffish is 
too delicate a word; Grimm is a petty criminal -- with class; the tone is a 
little like "Breaking In" or even "The Hot Rock," although Grimm is as 
resourceful as "The Hot Rock's" gang was terminally inept. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Franklin, who adapted the movie, was obviously drawn to Cronley's 
dialogue, so seductively cadenced it speaks to you right from the page and so 
uncannily close to Murray's own deadpan voice that it might have been written 
for him. So the question for Franklin became how far from the straight and 
narrow could these anti-heroes be allowed to stray, and how much of Cronley's 
picaresque characters and narrative meandering could the audience absorb? 
</P>
<P>
Franklin has jettisoned major points of the original story, including its final 
quarter; he's tidied up Grimm's background -- he's now a disillusioned city 
planner -- and made a pass at making Grimm's robbery a final act of protest 
toward a city Grimm considers morally bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
These are big changes, and co-directors Franklin and Murray have come up with 
wild new improvisations on inner city madness in the cityscape section, yet the 
feeling from the movie is that it's Cronley's people you're meeting up there, 
in all their nutty glory. The book and the movie remain separate yet equally 
funny; you leave the movie wanting to read more of the author, at the same time 
your appetite is whetted for more from these debuting directors, together or 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
With "Presumed Innocent," screenwriter Frank Pierson and director Alan J. 
Pakula, who shares the writing credit, had their work cut out for them. Scott 
Turow's novel on the unalterable weight and workings of the law had been the 
must-read of 1987, so a certain portion of the audience would be in on the 
ending. The trick would be to hold them in spite of what they already knew; to 
de-emphasize the mystery part of the murder and concentrate on the ironic 
workings of justice, and to make the reading audience feel that "their" 
characters were in the best possible hands. (In this respect, obscure material 
is far easier to work from; there's at least room to maneuver without being 
thought a defiler of the temple.) 
</P>
<P>
"Presumed Innocent" is not a case where hacking cuts were made in the novel; 
it's more like extremely skillful cosmetic surgery. As one audience member has 
already noted in an acerbic letter to The Times, Carolyn Polhemus, the pivotal 
siren of the piece, was made 10 or 12 years younger, the better to be played by 
Greta Scacchi, while her teen-age son and his minor plot contributions were 
jettisoned completely. 
</P>
<P>
While the reader's indignation is understandable, it's also a tellingly naive 
view of big studio moviemaking; she sees no reason why the seductress couldn't 
be in 
</P>
<P>
her early 40s, as she is in the book, gaining the depth that those 10 years of 
living might have given her. A major studio film with a wife and a mistress 
both in their 40s? What does she take Hollywood for, romantic France? 
</P>
<P>
Next, it was crucial that audiences have the maximum empathy with Bonnie 
Bedelia's Barbara Sabich, deeply wounded by her knowledge of her husband's 
ongoing affair with the alluring Polhemus. To cut her character closer to the 
upper middle-class American norm, out went the book's idea that she had money 
of her own. Instead of Barbara volunteering her trust fund to finance her 
husband's trial, the Sabiches mortgage their house to pay the legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
The book's in-depth characterization of this wife -- analytical, ferociously 
intelligent, facing her doctorate in mathematics, "weird" in the eyes of most 
people outside her family -- has only been suggested. It's left for Bedelia to 
fill in her psychological profile and she's done so with equally ferocious 
intelligence. There's no question that Barbara Sabich has been made less 
cerebral, somewhat less complex and more balanced; however in terms of the 
film's final emotional equilibrium, it's a smart adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
In the precarious matter of keeping an audience's sympathy, the screenwriters 
cannily opted for Sabich togetherness in the wake of the trial, rather than the 
book's trial separation. Then, most critically, they switched characters in the 
grand finale, a change that made it infinitely more cinematic and personal. In 
the novel these dark matters are told to a peripheral character, a device that 
only works on paper -- do that in a film, keep the camera away from the 
characters' faces and the moment is fatally distanced. 
</P>
<P>
Of all these movies, "Presumed Innocent" has been made as nearly congruent with 
its original novel as possible in a film. As for those who found Harrison 
Ford's playing of prosecutor Rusty Sabich too tightly reined in, there are 
dozens of citations from the book to suggest he's exactly on target. The novel 
is written in Sabich's first-person; one of author Turow's most telling 
glimpses of the man himself is the scene as Sabich's mother is dying of cancer. 
It is the supposedly cool and aloof Barbara who is able to be there for her, 
keeping up a running murmur of comfort, while Sabich comments that "I, as ever, 
was too full of private grief to make my own approach." 
</P>
<P>
Wrangles over "Wild at Heart" are probably going to break up dinner parties 
until the next great movie controversy comes along, but if you're curious to 
know how David Lynch could make a boring film, part of the answer lies in Barry 
Gifford's novel, the other part with Lynch himself. Lynch's inventiveness has 
seemed inexhaustible, yet "Wild at Heart" finds him running in place, his 
darkly comic vision turned into exhibitionistic silliness. One can only hope 
it's a very short phase. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, novelist-biographer-poet-editor-essayist Gifford finds Lynch the 
"perfect cinematic translator" for his mini-novel, the first quarter of "The 
Sailor and Lula Novels" due out early next year. Gifford's road saga is almost 
solid dialogue, the salty cracker conversation of 20-year-old Lula Pace Fortune 
and her 23-year-old lover Sailor Ripley, on the run from her mom and his parole 
board. Glued together in perfect, dippy harmony they juke their way through New 
Orleans and the South to a dead end in Big Tuna, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
They are Sail and Peanut to each other, although on the printed page, Lula 
doesn't know if she completely enjoys his calling her "peanut" so much: "Puts 
me so far down on the food chain." Lula is never quite this cracklingly aware 
on screen; Lynch never gives us enough examples to back up Sailor's claim that 
she has a really odd mind. 
</P>
<P>
On screen she's simply a fool for love -- or "Love Me Tender" -- and she and 
Sailor seem so disaffected, so jaded that, in spite of the heroic work of Laura 
Dern and Nicolas Cage, they can't give the film the center it needs to keep us 
amused and interested. The book doesn't have one either, but it's able to coast 
for a while on its funny, funky peapatch dialogue, until even interest in that 
splutters out. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who did the adaptation himself, tries to give the lassitude of the 
narrative a little push, then he gets sidetracked adding eye-popping 
embellishments to the baroque characters along the way. Thus if Gifford gives 
us Auntie Rootie's slightly deteriorating son Dell, Lynch gives Dell 
matchbook-size cockroaches in his underwear and 
Lynch-only-knows-where-else-besides, then casts Crispin Glover to get the 
maximum weirdness from this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Anything Gifford has done, Lynch has done one better -- or wilder and he has 
held the patent on grotesquerie since "Eraserhead" in 1978. In "Blue Velvet," 
one could ascribe a certain political subversiveness to Lynch's vision of rot 
beneath the surface of Reagan's perfect white-picket fence America. This time 
the embellishments seem like a kid's gross-out contest: a lot of spilled 
brains, a dog running off with a severed arm while its owner flops after it; 
the cockroaches; the arc of a shotgunned head before it squishes onto the 
ground and no discernible purpose to any of this filigree. 
</P>
<P>
In Gifford's eyes Lynch may be his perfect cinematic translator, but it may not 
go both ways: the loose weave of Gifford's prose, his fondness for bizarre 
anecdotes and characters may be more encouragement than Lynch needs. Especially 
when the director's only weapon against rampant evil seems to be spun sugar, 
hyper-romanticism (well, maybe irono-romanticism) and "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Thompson's unrelenting novels have come to be synonymous with film noir, 
particularly the dark side of the "sunny" Eisenhower era; for all their 
popularity it's been said they leave no comfortable place for a reader to sit. 
Thompson's yarns are frequently told in the first person, a person you'd think 
twice about before you'd be left alone with him. 
</P>
<P>
So, how to make a film from the point of view of a character roughly as stable 
as quicksand? In what era to set it? Are Thompson's books so irrevocably 
anchored to their time that they can only be made as kitschy period pieces, 
full of Venetian blind shadows and bias-cut dresses? These were some of the 
questions Robert Redlin and co-writer/director James Foley wrestled with in 
adapting "After Dark, My Sweet," one of Thompson's marginally less nihilistic 
books. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no problem moving "After Dark's" three desert dwellers into 
the present: the narrator, unbalanced ex-boxer Collie (Jason Patric); the 
self-destructive widow Fay (Rachel Ward); and the small-potatoes con man Doc 
(Bruce Dern.) The very cliche of the desert's timelessness works in the movie's 
favor. Actually, what sets Thompson apart from his cohorts in noir, Dashiell 
Hammett and Raymond Chandler, is Thompson's trick of setting action in an 
unidentifiable, unnamed town and in a state of mind rather than a season. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist-screenwriter Donald E. Westlake, who wrote "The Stepfather," the novel 
of "The Hot Rock" and the forthcoming adaptation of Thompson's "The Grifters," 
said in a radio interview recently that at the end of a day of working on "The 
Grifters" the question he asked himself was always, "Does it sound like Jim 
Thompson?" 
</P>
<P>
"After Dark, My Sweet" does. It has good, tough imaginative additions that 
could have come straight from Thompson's pages, but didn't: those frowsy date 
palm trees, for example, in back of Fay's stucco ranch house. At the same time, 
they are eloquent witnesses to her dead husband's dotty get-rich-quick schemes 
and they provide Collie with his one real taste of accomplishment, getting 
those trees "working" again. The adapters have been scrupulous too, as they 
weeded out period slang, not to lose the biting metallic flavor of Thompson's 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge was empathy. Film noir with its classic, world-weary 
narrator, its loners and its dames, all selling each other out at dizzying 
speed, means to keep us at arm's length and it succeeds. But with a child 
kidnapping at the center of its plot, if "After Dark, My Sweet" is to work with 
audience members at all, it must have one character for them to hope for. 
Unlikely though it seems, that person becomes Jason Patric's Collie, boxing's 
lethal Kid Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Presumed Innocent's" Rusty Sabich, but on the other end of the physical 
spectrum, Collie comes alive through a performance of consummate intensity. To 
read the book is to see that Patric has internalized everything Thompson has 
written about this sweet, maybe dangerous escaped mental patient who in the 
final paroxysms becomes the film's moral center. "After Dark, My Sweet" is a 
complex, extraordinarily generous complement to its source and the 
kaleidoscopic brilliance and intelligence of Patric's work is at its heart. 
We'll have more major books-into-films between now and Christmas: Carrie 
Fisher's "Postcards from the Edge," for director Mike Nichols; Nicolas 
Pileggi's "Wiseguys," which has become "Good Fellas," for Martin Scorsese; 
Larry McMurtry's "Texasville" for Peter Bogdanovich; another Jim Thompson work, 
"The Grifters," for director Stephen Frears; Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the 
Vanities" for Brian De Palma and Peter Viertel's "White Hunter, Black Heart," 
for Clint Eastwood.

Books and films are separate art forms and it's useless to wish that one would 
perform the other's high-wire act. But when all's right with the heavens, 
movies that grow from books seem to have an extra layer of subtlety and 
resonance. When you see one that has, stop for a minute to think about the work 
of the adapter, an artist working with respect, compassion, wit, humanity and 
the sharpest razor this side of Sweeney Todd.

DONNIE WAHLBERG OF NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Squealing girls could be heard in the background when New Kid on the Block 
Donnie Wahlberg called from backstage at the Gene Stone Stadium in Greenville, 
N.C. Shrieking girls are, in fact, the unofficial trademark of this teen 
phenomenon. In the tradition of Frankie Avalon, the Monkees and the Bay City 
Rollers, the New Kids -- Jordan Knight, Danny Wood, Jonathan Knight, Joe 
McIntyre and Wahlberg -- drive the little girls wild and the critics to 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived in 1985 by producer Maurice Starr (who writes and produces most of 
New Kids' material), this group from Dorchester, Mass., has racked up worldwide 
sales of more than 18 million copies of their four albums, and they're 
currently in the midst of a hugely successful tour that brings them to the 
Pacific Amphitheater on Wednesday and Thursday (both shows are sold out), and 
Dodger Stadium on Friday. (Tickets are still available for that show.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlberg, 20, was the first to join the group and often assumes the role of 
spokesman. A thoughtful, intelligent young man, Wahlberg views the craze 
surrounding New Kids with a detachment that's impressive for one so young. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: The kind of success New Kids are enjoying can't last. Do you dread 
the day when the career shifts gears, or are you looking forward to having 
things cool off a bit? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: That's an interesting way to ask that question -- most people just say, 
"Brace yourselves 'cause it's all gonna come crashing down." Actually, it may 
be kind of nice for it to end, to get a little freedom. Everyone tells us New 
Kids are just a fad and that like all teen idols we'll disappear, but we're 
doing things a lot of those other groups didn't do because this is a different 
age. 
</P>
<P>
When the Beatles were around, you watched Ed Sullivan and that was it, but 
music is everywhere now. It's in your car, in school on your Walkman, and there 
are TV channels devoted to music. Music is in a different state now than it's 
ever been and that may play a part in our longevity. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, the girls are gonna grow up and stop screaming, but we give our fans 
everything we've got and I think a lot of these people ain't gonna forget that. 
But if this all ends tomorrow, it's not gonna be the end of my life -- I'll 
just go on and do something else because there's lots of stuff in my life 
besides this. I was alive 15 years before I was a New Kid and I'll probably be 
alive at least 15 more after New Kids. 
</P>
<P>
Q: New Kids have been criticized for involving themselves with merchandising 
tie-ins. Is it necessary for you to do this to finance your tours, or do you do 
it simply because you like the products? 
</P>
<P>
A: When you tour with a stage that costs over a million dollars, it's hard to 
pay for. So when McDonald's tells me -- a guy who came from a family on food 
stamps -- that we wanna help pay for your stage and all you have to do is have 
a McDonald's sign on stage, am I so great that I gotta say hell no, get outta 
here? There are companies I wouldn't work with and we turn tons of stuff down, 
but there are five people in the group. If four Kids wanna do something and one 
Kid don't, sometimes you gotta sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you feel about the fact that so much of what's written about you 
focuses on the marketing of the group rather than its music? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's true that critics usually only write about the screaming girls and the 
McDonald's signs and hardly mention our work as entertainers. I think a lot of 
writers are afraid to write anything else because it wouldn't be considered 
hip. How can a 30-year-old, supposedly hip rock critic give us a good review 
when our shows attract 10,000 girls between the ages of 8 and 20? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Maurice Starr is often credited as the creative force behind the group. How 
true is that? 
</P>
<P>
A: He's the creative force in the sense that it was his idea, but I don't know 
why people see that as a knock on the group, because every group comes from an 
idea. I'm sure U2 wasn't every member in the band's idea -- it was one guy's 
idea and he got the other guys together. Maurice's role has been very much 
exaggerated. I'm shocked when supposedly serious writers ask me, "Does Maurice 
pick what you wear?" Are these people crazy? 
</P>
<P>
Maurice put the group together, he writes and produces the music, and that's 
it. He didn't teach me to dance, sing, rap or have soul -- the reason we got in 
the group was because we knew how to do that stuff. These rumors are all a 
reflection of ignorance on the part of the press. For instance, there's the 
lip-syncing rumors. Reviewers have come to our shows and said New Kids are 
lip-syncing -- when I'm singing notes out of tune and my voice is cracking! You 
can hear it clear as day and they've still got the nerve to say I'm 
lip-syncing! (New Kids manager Dick Scott told The Times that during some 
vigorous dance numbers in concert, the group does lip-sync to vocal tapes.) 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does the group represent to people? What do you see as being its image? 
</P>
<P>
A: Everything written about us focuses on how clean-cut we are. I feel bad 
about our image because we're not responsible for it -- it's something the 
media created. I've never been a clean-cut person, but I do consider myself a 
positive person, and that's why I speak out against drugs. I grew up with drugs 
in my own family and saw them take some of my family members down, so I know 
what a serious problem it is and I'm committed to working against them. But 
that don't make me a goody-goody -- that's just being smart and positive. 
</P>
<P>
This wholesome image the press has foisted on us is a double-edged sword. 
They've put us on this pedestal and now they want to knock us down, and they're 
all waiting for one of us to have a baby or get caught doing drugs. If I spit 
on the sidewalk or get in a fight -- stuff that's been happening all my life -- 
it's a big deal now. But I refuse to be constrained by that. People can write 
what they want, but I'm gonna keep on being me. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you feel about the fact that you're a role model for thousands of 
kids; do you feel a sense of responsibility about that? 
</P>
<P>
A: I didn't get into this intending to brainwash 10 million white kids. We came 
out as ourselves and they accepted us as role models. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the best thing about having money? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a funny thing. All my life I wanted money 'cause I never had any, and 
now that I've got it I don't want the gold jewelry that I wanted or the cars 
and the clothes -- all I want is to do for my family. And that's all I've done. 
I bought a house for my mother and a house for my father, a car for my brother, 
and put 50 grand into my brother's album, which I'm producing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The New Kids are together around the clock. How do you all manage to get 
along? 
</P>
<P>
A: We were surprised when we first discovered that we didn't always get along. 
We were just having fun when this started, then all of a sudden we're together 
24 hours a day every day of the year. It hit us like wham! This is not just fun 
and games! We realized we were different people with different tastes and 
beliefs, and we've gone through phases adjusting to that. 
</P>
<P>
On the first tour we did everything together, then on the next tour people 
started wanting to do different things -- and we realized we didn't all have to 
do everything together. It was hard at first 'cause you feel left out and 
stuff, but this tour everyone's just doing their own thing. It's helped the 
unity of the group 'cause it's taken a lot of pressure off us. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has what's happened to you in the past two years made you grow up fast, or 
has it arrested your natural development as people? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's hard to say. What's happened to me is kind of weird and I try and 
deal with it the best way I know how, which is to have fun with it. But I don't 
think it's changed me that much. When this first started I remember my father 
saying to me if I ever came home and wasn't the same kid, he was gonna kick my 
ass, and remembering that has helped me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that New Kids have on-stage hugging contests at their concerts? 
</P>
<P>
A: Naw. It may have happened a few times because things often happen out of the 
blue on stage. We do a lot of spontaneous stuff. I used to bring like 10 girls 
on stage and kiss 'em all. It wasn't a part of the show -- one night I just did 
it. As to how serious the kisses were, I try and be fair but sometimes the fans 
get a little too generous with their kisses.

U.N. TO COMMIT FUNDS FOR 'CHILDREN'S VACCINE' SEARCH; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: WORLD ORGANIZATION SEEKS A SINGLE-DOSE IMMUNIZATION AGAINST ALL MAJOR 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

<P>
The United Nations is expected to announce today that it will commit $150 
million to begin development of a universal "children's vaccine" that would 
provide protection against all major childhood infectious diseases with a 
single dose. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a giant step toward harnessing the biotechnology revolution for 
the child survival revolution," said James P. Grant, executive director of the 
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), one of three U.N. agencies sponsoring 
the project. The others are the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United 
Nations Development Programme. 
</P>
<P>
"We can now begin to redirect our . . . objectives to protecting children 
against killer diseases with vaccines designed to meet the rigorous delivery 
requirements of the developing world," Grant said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the three agencies, which were scheduled to announce the program 
in New York today, predicted that the combined vaccine could save the lives of 
at least 8 million children in the developing world who die annually from these 
diseases, as well as prevent some 900 million episodes of severe illness. 
</P>
<P>
International health experts have long believed that vaccine immunization 
programs represent the most cost-effective way to protect the world's children 
from the major killers, which include polio, measles, tuberculosis, whooping 
cough, tetanus and diphtheria. But the programs are constrained by the need to 
administer multiple injections and follow-up booster shots, causing costs to 
increase and participation to fall off. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the limitations, vaccination programs already have achieved a 
remarkable degree of success. In 1974, for example, only 5% of children in the 
developing world received vaccines for the major diseases, said Dr. Barry 
Bloom, a professor of microbiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 
the Bronx. By 1990, however, the figure had jumped to 60% to 70%, "which is an 
extraordinary achievement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The vaccines have made an enormous impact," said Bloom, who also serves as a 
consultant to the U.N. agencies. "Two million lives are saved each year that 
would have been lost in 1974. But we know we're going to have great trouble -- 
even with existing vaccines -- getting from where we are now to all kids. 
That's why we need new kinds of vaccines." 
</P>
<P>
A "dream" children's vaccine would be designed to overcome the two biggest 
obstacles to successful immunization: It would require no refrigeration and 
would minimize a child's contacts with the health delivery system, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a single-dose vaccine that contains all the substances required to 
protect children against the major infectious diseases, that is given once 
orally and that would remain stable without refrigeration," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Most vaccines require refrigeration, a problem in the hot climates of many 
developing nations, and also require booster shots. With existing vaccines, 
complete immunization against the six major diseases now requires between seven 
and 14 contacts between a child and health providers, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, DPT, the combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria, 
pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus, requires an initial shot followed at 
separate intervals by two boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"For each booster in the Third World, about 15% of the kids drop out," Bloom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that only 14% of the expense of vaccinating a child is the cost of the 
vaccine itself. "The rest is the cost of getting it out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials characterized a universal children's vaccine as "a distant but 
achievable goal," and would not predict when one might be available. Bloom 
speculated that such a vaccine could be developed within a decade, particularly 
as a result of advances in genetic and molecular engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Work is under way on vaccine technology that can deliver booster shots with 
only one injection. The technique is called microencapsulation and involves 
administering antigens -- substances that produce antibodies and provide 
immunity -- in a biodegradable, "time released" delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
Such a one-shot, controlled-release vaccine is now being developed for neonatal 
tetanus, which afflicts children in developing countries at the time of birth 
and kills an estimated 750,000 newborns annually. Currently, immunization for 
tetanus requires three injections. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said that another priority will be to develop vaccines for 
diseases for which vaccines are now lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Such diseases include rotavirus, which kills 800,000 children annually from 
acute diarrhea; respiratory syncytial virus, an infectious disease of the lower 
respiratory tract that accounts for 40% of all acute respiratory infections in 
children under the age of 1; meningococcal meningitis, which afflicts between 
600,000 and 1 million children annually, with a mortality rate of 20%, and 
dengue, a viral disease spread by mosquitoes that infects 30 million to 60 
million people every year. 
</P>
<P>
"New and improved vaccines will help us to save millions of young lives by 
extending the effective reach of preventive medicine," Grant said.

IRAQ'S ARSENAL A PEACE BARRIER, MUBARAK SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Middle East can never enjoy real peace as long as Iraq maintains its potent 
arsenal of missiles and chemical weapons, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
And, without setting a deadline for the current economic sanctions to force an 
Iraqi capitulation, Mubarak strongly suggested that the military threat posed 
by Baghdad must be eliminated within a matter of months. 
</P>
<P>
With Secretary of State James A. Baker III standing at his side, Mubarak said 
he would prefer diplomatic measures to neutralize President Saddam Hussein's 
threatening weaponry but that military means may prove necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"You know we are against chemical weapons, against the presence of missiles," 
Mubarak said " . . . I think peace will never go with the presence of all these 
forms of weapons in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks there is any chance that Iraq will give up those arms unless 
it is defeated militarily, Mubarak said, "We would like, first of all, to try 
peaceful solutions. We shouldn't go through war solutions at all unless that is 
a hopeless case." 
</P>
<P>
By suggesting that the five-week-old gulf crisis cannot be resolved until Iraq 
surrenders its missiles and chemical weapons, Mubarak went far beyond U.N. 
Security Council resolutions calling for Hussein's regime to end its occupation 
of Kuwait and restore the exiled emir to power. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has scorned the U.N. sanctions, insisting that it will never reverse its 
annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's regime is even less likely to agree to give up its chemical weapons 
capabilities without a fight. However, if Iraq reverses course and ends its 
occupation of Kuwait, there would be tremendous pressure to end the economic 
sanctions, making it unlikely that Baghdad could be persuaded peacefully to 
destroy its chemical arms. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sent several thousand troops to the multinational force in Saudi 
Arabia, probably making it the second-largest foreign contingent on the ground. 
While refusing to disclose exact numbers, Mubarak said Egypt will soon expand 
its contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"We are supporting the Saudis as much as we can," he said. "We will send them 
the forces needed which is agreed upon. We sent some forces now. We are 
intending to send other forces in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Bush Administration has said that a military offensive cannot be 
ruled out if the U.N.-imposed economic boycott does not force Hussein to end 
his occupation. But Washington has set no deadline. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak said the crisis must be resolved -- either peacefully or by 
armed force -- within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not predict that the crisis would end in one, two or three 
months "but I'm telling you that doesn't mean it is going to stay for one 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Baker met alone for 90 minutes in a lavish 19th-Century palace 
overlooking the Mediterranean which once was used by King Farouk, the 
free-spending libertine who was Egypt's last monarch. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, Baker flew to Helsinki, Finland, to attend 
President Bush's summit meeting today with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he had told Baker that he hopes Bush and Gorbachev will be able to 
avoid any sort of disagreement on their approaches to the gulf crisis. He said 
that if there were differences "this would be a hell of a problem in this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
During a hectic three days in the Middle East, Baker discussed the crisis with 
the king of Saudi Arabia, the president of the United Arab Emirates and the 
deposed emir of Kuwait as well as with Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told reporters that he discussed the possible use of military force at 
every stop. 
</P>
<P>
However, it seems clear that no consensus has emerged on military measures. A 
senior Saudi official said the kingdom opposes the use of force unless Iraq 
attacks Saudi Arabia, but a member of Kuwait's exiled Cabinet said military 
action probably will be needed to end the occupation and it should be 
undertaken as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington, Baker suggested the creation of some sort of Persian 
Gulf security structure, including long-term American participation, to contain 
Iraq's military might even if the crisis ends peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday, 
Baker compared his proposed structure to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. The next day, in an appearance before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, Baker said that consideration of the plan was still in its 
early stages and that the NATO analogy might not be apt. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials, perhaps alarmed by a banner headline in the English-language 
Saudi News saying Baker had proposed "a Gulf NATO," told Baker they did not 
want a NATO clone in their region but were willing to discuss other approaches. 
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Mubarak, Baker said, "We don't have anything 
specifically in mind. . . . The president (Mubarak) and I discussed the 
importance of states that are located in the region giving some thought to what 
form of security arrangements can best guarantee peace and stability in the 
Persian Gulf after we get beyond the current crisis." 
</P>
<P>
As for long-term deployment of U.S. forces in the area, Baker noted that 
Washington has had at least a token naval presence in the gulf since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
In one consequence of the crisis, Mubarak hinted that he may be ready to end 
Egypt's support for Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, 
who embraced Iraq's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process is not only for Yasser Arafat but the 
Palestinian people," Mubarak said. "So, anything that is done by Yasser Arafat 
doesn't mean we are going to stop dealing with the Palestinian problem."

U.S. CONSIDERS AIR BLOCKADE TO STIFFEN EMBARGO 
</P>

<P>
The United States is considering escalating the trade embargo against Iraq into 
an aerial blockade and will seek Soviet endorsement of the plan along with 
other military assistance in the Persian Gulf at today's summit in Helsinki, 
Finland, diplomatic sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leaders have already agreed "in principle" to transport a Syrian armored 
division to Saudi Arabia and may also agree to ship American military materiel, 
including spare parts and medical supplies, to help support the multinational 
defense force in the Saudi desert, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
It is considered unlikely that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would 
agree to commit Soviet troops to the multinational force, but leaders of the 
defense effort in the Persian Gulf consider even a token Kremlin commitment, 
such as an agreement to transport troops and war materiel, to be crucial to 
maintaining international backing for the military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union will end up shipping Syrian troops, and may even ship 
American war materiel for the U.S. to Saudi Arabia," said one source who, with 
the others who discussed the Soviet talks, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't send troops, fine. But the point is, if they help ship troops, if 
they help send American materiel, you implicate them. . . . They're part of the 
operation," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said President Bush will also consult Gorbachev about 
the possibility of stepping up the naval blockade of Iraqi imports and exports 
into an aerial blockade, halting air shipments of supplies bound for Baghdad 
from Iraq's allies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"To go from here to an air blockade is only one step more," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said there is evidence that Libya has been flying supplies 
into Iraq in violation of the international sanctions, and some Arab sources 
said they believe that Yemen and possibly North Korea may also attempt to 
airlift supplies to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Many officials believe the U.N. resolution authorizing the naval blockade does 
not restrict the measure to the halting of ships bound for Iraq or departing 
from there, but the matter of stopping flights into and out of Iraq presents 
unique problems and requires additional international support, several 
diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Planes are a little bit harder to force down than ships. You can board a ship, 
or you can fire over the bow, but it's kind of hard to board an airplane in 
flight," one official said. "It's either all or nothing. You have to assume 
that if you fire at an airplane, it's going down." 
</P>
<P>
To enforce such a blockade, countries over which supply flights would pass 
would have to sign agreements forbidding the overflights. Any flights violating 
the overflight regulations could be confronted in the air by military escort 
jets or, in the worst case, if a plane refused to land, "you would have good 
international grounds to force it down," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another way of enforcing the blockade would be to require any flights bound for 
Iraq to present themselves for inspection before takeoff, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, most officials do not believe that airlifts into Iraq can furnish 
that nation with enough provisions to outweigh the impact of an effective naval 
blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically speaking, you can't support 17 million people with an airlift," 
said one source. "It's way beyond the logistic capability of Iraq or even those 
countries that are aiding him (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein). Remember, the 
countries that are aiding Iraq are all desperately poor themselves." 
</P>
<P>
If things go well at the summit, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al 
Faisal is expected to travel to Moscow soon after the summit to announce the 
resumption of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union after a 
break of more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that talks about renewing relations began in earnest a 
little less than two weeks ago, when Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United 
States, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, traveled to Moscow to discuss growing Soviet 
concerns about the American military buildup in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis believe that with the Soviets now out of Afghanistan, Ethiopia and 
what was formerly South Yemen, "now is the time to establish relations, and 
Gorbachev is a man we can work with," one government source said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet assistance in helping transport an additional Syrian armored brigade to 
Saudi Arabia is key to helping supplement Arab and Islamic forces in the 
region, which officials this week said could soon nearly equal the number of 
U.S. forces now on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt has indicated it may commit an additional 30,000 troops to the 2,000 
commandos it has already stationed near Saudi Arabia's border with Kuwait, and 
Pakistan may dispatch an additional 5,000 troops to supplement the 5,000-troop 
force already committed, diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, they said, the Arab and Islamic forces could total 75,000 to 80,000, in 
addition to an American force that is expected to reach 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of the forces would be prepared to launch an offensive action 
until mid-October, a time at which officials will determine how well the 
economic sanctions against Iraq have worked, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The troops sent into Saudi Arabia by the last half of October will be in a 
position to launch a military attack," one official said. "The next step at 
that time would be to get the right to intervene militarily, to dislodge Iraq 
from Kuwait."

DEUKMEJIAN SAYS 'BIG GREEN' WILL JEOPARDIZE JOBS

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, echoing the campaign of the chemical industry and 
business leaders, attacked Proposition 128 on Saturday as a threat to the 
state's economy that could cost some voters their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor also charged that environmentalists and celebrities who 
support the sweeping environmental initiative are trying to trick the public 
into approving a costly measure that would create "new government bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
"You may have heard the expression, 'it's not nice to fool Mother Nature,' " 
Deukmejian said. "But these so-called supporters of Mother Nature are trying to 
fool you." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, dubbed the "Big Green" by its backers, would ban 
cancer-causing chemicals in food, tax oil companies to pay for the cleanup of 
offshore oil spills, preserve ancient redwood forests and try to slow the 
destruction of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Pope, conservation director of the Sierra Club and a co-sponsor of 
Proposition 128, countered Deukmejian's charges, saying that the governor's 
refusal to sign stricter environmental laws had made it necessary for 
environmentalists to go the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"George Deukmejian is more responsible for Big Green than anyone else," Pope 
said. "It has been his lack of leadership, his veto of good environmental 
legislation and his refusal to implement environmental laws that forced us to 
put Big Green on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's charge that environmentalists were seeking to fool the voters, 
he added, is part of a "big lie campaign" by the industry to mislead voters 
into defeating the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a well-worn track record of who's trying to fool people," Pope said. 
"It's not the environmental community. It's the people who have tried to 
destroy the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's assault on the initiative, his first formal opposition to the 
ballot proposal, comes as the opposition, financed primarily by chemical 
companies and other corporations, gears up its campaign to defeat the measure 
in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Industry radio commercials aired throughout the state have been attacking 
Proposition 128 as "the Hayden Initiative" because Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), a onetime anti-war radical, is a leading co-sponsor of the 
measure. The ads also charge that the initiative tries to do too much and will 
cost the taxpayers billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In his Saturday radio address, Deukmejian picked up the same themes, saying 
that "the Hayden Initiative" will cause "tornado-like changes" in California's 
"favorable business climate." 
</P>
<P>
"This measure would force California's farmers and businesses to comply with 
hundreds of new regulations," the governor said. "It also would create a new 
government bureaucracy that would immediately spend 40 million of your tax 
dollars each year. And according to the Legislative Analyst, the long-term 
price tag of the measure could reach nearly $3 billion." 
</P>
<P>
During nearly eight years as governor, Deukmejian has often been at odds with 
the environmental community, resisting major environmental laws and opposing 
such landmark measures as Proposition 65, the anti-toxics initiative 
overwhelmingly approved by the voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But in his speech, the governor cast himself as a supporter of the environment 
saying: "Protecting the environment is important to all of us." He argued that 
the state already has enough laws to protect the state's coast, forests, air, 
water and food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"California already has the toughest environmental safeguards in the nation, if 
not the entire world," the governor said. "We should allow those laws to do 
their job rather than pile on layer upon layer of new regulations which will 
have marginal impact on the environment, but could have a drastic impact on 
your jobs and livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
Pope of the Sierra Club noted that Deukmejian made the same kind of speech four 
years ago when he charged that Proposition 65 would damage the state's economy. 
Instead, Pope said, California has created more jobs than in any other 
four-year period in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 has drawn much of its support from the entertainment community, 
with dozens of celebrities -- ranging from Jack Lemmon to Jane Fonda to 
Sylvester Stallone -- helping to raise money and promote the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian sought to counter their appeal, saying: "These individuals are 
entitled to their opinions and the right to express them. But voters should 
remember that, for the most part, these stars are not considering the kinds of 
policies we need to keep our people working." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said it was important to strike a balance between the environment 
and the economy.

A DESERT SPREAD IN COACHELLA VALLEY FOR FRINGE-TOED LIZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COACHELLA VALLEY PRESERVE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This 13,000-acre stretch of desert 15 miles east of Palm Springs was purchased 
for $25 million to save, preserve and protect a rare, elusive lizard. 
</P>
<P>
The world's only home of the Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard is 500 acres 
of sand dunes in this preserve. 
</P>
<P>
But those who come here expecting to see the 8- to 10-inch-long, sand-colored, 
black-mottled lizard -- a species listed by the federal government as 
threatened and by the state as endangered -- are almost always disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Since the dedication of the preserve four years ago, fewer than 100 of the 
80,000 visitors have seen one. The others had to settle for photographs and 
descriptions at the Thousand Palms Oasis visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
The fringe-toed isn't a leaping lizard. But it's a real speedster, able to bury 
itself in the sand almost in the flick of an eyelid. With its shovel-shaped 
snout, the lizard digs several inches into the dune and disappears in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It gets its name from fringe-like scales on its toes that provide traction, 
like snowshoes, on the sand. A heat sensor on top of its head that looks like 
an eye warns the lizard when the temperature is too hot, and it's time to duck 
beneath the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Superbly adapted to being a dune dweller, the fringe-toed lizard's snout has a 
trapdoor that prevents sand from entering its nose and lungs. Its double set of 
eyelids, one horizontal, the other vertical, also keep out sand. 
</P>
<P>
Beetles, crickets and other insects provide the main diet for the lizards, 
which hibernate beneath the sand surface from November through March. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, fringe-toed lizards were found on sand dunes scattered throughout 
200 square miles of the Coachella Valley. Today several thousand exist only on 
a mile square of sand dunes in the preserve," said Cameron Barrows, 35, the 
Nature Conservancy's Southern California manager. 
</P>
<P>
Areas where lizards once thrived are now desert communities, golf courses, 
mobile-home parks. With the habitat shrinking and further development looming, 
the Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the 
state Department of Fish and Game joined forces to purchase the preserve land 
and manage it as wild desert. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, when the federal government listed the Coachella Valley fringe-toed 
lizard as threatened, the action initiated a series of events that culminated 
in the establishment of the preserve," Barrows said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Off-road vehicles were running amok on the sand dunes (and) killing 
the fringe-toed lizards in wholesale fashion. The dunes where the lizard lives 
are replenished with sand washing down an alluvial fan from the Indio Hills and 
blown into dune areas by strong winds." 
</P>
<P>
To preserve the lizard's habitat, it was necessary to protect the area 
generating the sand as well as the dunes. By setting aside 13,000 acres, an 
entire ecosystem of flora and fauna once common throughout much of Coachella 
Valley is being preserved, Barrows said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the preserve are a dozen oases containing the largest groves of desert 
fan palms in California. There are palm-boring beetles, cockroaches, Jerusalem 
crickets, giant red velvet mites and a round-tailed ground squirrel that, like 
the fringe-toed lizard, is found nowhere else on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wilhelm, 78, is probably better acquainted with fringe-toed lizards than 
anyone. "I've grown up with the lizards. I've seen them all my life," said the 
nature writer and former resident caretaker of the preserve's Thousand Palms 
Oasis. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen fringe-toed lizards swimming under the sand many, many times. When 
they bury themselves in the dunes, you can see them moving rapidly under the 
surface, disturbing the sand on top." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm's father bought the 80-acre Thousand Palms Oasis in 1906 from 
prospector Albert (Alkali) L. Thornburg for two mules and a wagon. The oasis is 
a lush grove of huge 60- to 70-foot-tall 100- to 250-year-old fan palms 
surrounding a spring-fed pond. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, when he was 20, Wilhelm built a home there out of palm logs. His pump 
house now serves as the preserve's visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm, a lifelong bachelor, sold the oasis to the Nature Conservancy in 1984 
with the provision he would live out his life in a cabin he built here near the 
palm log house. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, seeing the oasis and the desert surrounding it set aside forever as a 
nature preserve is a dream come true," Wilhelm said. He pointed to a thicket of 
mesquite bushes growing on the summit of a nearby mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"Cahuilla Indians for centuries have cremated their dead and buried their ashes 
in that mesquite grove. I have heard them sing their funeral dirges from the 
mountain top since I was a little boy. 
</P>
<P>
"The fringe-toed lizards, the oasis, the Indian burial grounds. There are many 
sacred things saved and protected in this unique nature preserve," the old man 
said.

A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHITE HOUSE IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are photographs of all but the first seven men to hold the office of 
President. But not until 1860 did photography helped a candidate get elected to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1860, a little-known Illinois lawyer walked into Mathew Brady's New 
York studio to have his portrait shot before he spoke at Cooper Union. Copies 
of that photograph of Abraham Lincoln were widely distributed on baseball 
card-sized boards; Lincoln later credited Brady and his Cooper Union speech 
with playing crucial roles in getting him elected to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first President to keep a military photographer 
around to shore up his public image; staff photographers and photojournalists 
through the days of President John F. Kennedy kept the public in touch with the 
magic of the office. 
</P>
<P>
George Tames, a New York Timesman and the 71-year-old dean of the White House 
photography corps, recalled taking pictures of the crippled Roosevelt after he 
had hoisted himself up by a crossbar installed in the back seat of his campaign 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"Roosevelt knew the value photography had in perpetuating the (presidential) 
myth," Tames said. "Every appearance was contrived to give the illusion that he 
could walk." 
</P>
<P>
Such a ruse held for Kennedy, too, Tames said, noting there were rarely 
pictures of the young President grimacing from back pain. Kennedy's clever 
press aides gave exclusives to magazine photographers to spend a day with the 
President. They produced cozy portraits -- the image of a demigod and his young 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House used us all by giving us breaks," recalled Cornell Capra, 
director of the International Center of Photography. "They created a great 
amount of excitement, and some of us were dazzled from our ringside seat."

WHITE HOUSE PUSHES OIL FIRM TAX BREAKS; 
</P>

BUDGET: DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN NEGOTIATORS CONTINUE MARATHON DEFICIT TALKS. 
THEY HOPE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT BY MONDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
As budget negotiators headed into the second day of marathon deficit reduction 
talks Saturday, the Bush Administration pressed for an agreement that would 
provide tax breaks for the oil industry and refused to rule out higher gasoline 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Against long odds complicated by a weakening economy and the Persian Gulf 
crisis, the negotiators hoped to reach an agreement by Monday to raise taxes 
and cut spending enough to slash the 1991 deficit by $50 billion and to save 
roughly $500 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, in a televised interview from 
Helsinki, said the Administration was "asking for some additional incentives, 
economic incentives" for oil drilling as part of any bipartisan budget accord 
for the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
While noting that the White House was not "enthusiastic" about Democratic 
proposals to raise gasoline taxes, Sununu acknowledged in a Cable News Network 
interview that such a tax increase could be "part of the package" worked out by 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers had considered higher energy taxes unlikely, particularly in 
light of widespread public objections to recent gasoline price increases caused 
by the disruption of oil shipments from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in self-imposed isolation at this air base 10 miles from Capitol Hill, 
Republicans and Democrats held separate sessions Saturday to review the other 
side's opening positions before resuming full-scale negotiations together. 
</P>
<P>
As the day went on, the negotiators -- including White House Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and more than a dozen 
lawmakers from both parties -- ejected staff members from the meetings and 
later forced reporters to leave the base. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators had a serious "blow-up" in mid-afternoon Saturday because of 
the sharp differences between Republicans and Democrats over the level of 
defense spending and the amount of cuts in domestic programs, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
But tempers cooled later and the talks got back on track. "There's a certain 
increasing sense of optimism," according to a source close to the discussions. 
"We are making progress." 
</P>
<P>
After months of desultory talks and a five-week summer break, the bargaining is 
finally getting serious, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're feeling each other out," said one source close to the negotiations. 
"It's getting close to make-or-break time." 
</P>
<P>
"It's what I call the basketball theory of politics," said Sununu, who is in 
Helsinki for President Bush's meeting today with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. "It's all done in the last two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
But negotiators must still pass major hurdles if they are to achieve a 
long-sought budget package that would make a substantive dent in the federal 
deficit. Without an agreement, the deficit for the fiscal year that begins on 
Oct. 1 is expected to soar to as much as $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
With the public largely disgusted with the endless maneuvering over the deficit 
but ambivalent over what to do about the situation, Democrats continue to fear 
blame for the politically painful spending cuts needed to narrow the budget 
gap. Republicans, despite Bush's decision to renege on his campaign pledge 
against higher taxes, remain sharply divided over raising taxes that would harm 
their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we cut? What do we reform on the domestic side? That's always the most 
difficult," Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) said just before negotiations opened 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Following the morning caucuses, bargaining between Republicans and Democrats 
resumed in the early afternoon. According to aides, who spoke on condition they 
not be identified, Democrats continued to demand deeper cuts in the Pentagon 
budget than Republicans want, while GOP bargainers said Democrats were 
reluctant to accept substantive cutbacks in major benefit programs such as 
Medicare and farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats opened discussions Friday with a proposal to raise gasoline taxes by 
seven cents a gallon, phase in a new energy tax, impose higher income taxes on 
those earning more than $200,000 a year and increase other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Congress acts to change the Gramm-Rudman budget law, failure to approve 
a package by Oct. 1 is supposed to trigger more than $100 billion in automatic 
spending cuts. If left in place for more than a short time, the cuts would have 
a devastating effect on a wide variety of programs.

NATURE: A FLOOD DEVASTATES AN INDIAN VILLAGE IN GRAND CANYON. NOW, RESIDENTS 
ARE TRYING TO ASSESS DAMAGE TO HOMES, LAND AND LIVESTOCK.

SUPAI, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Uqualla was riding behind his string of fully loaded pack horses toward his 
village in the Grand Canyon when the biggest flash floods of his life roared 
down Havasu Creek, sweeping the animals away like toys. 
</P>
<P>
Each was weighted with six, 80-pound sacks of feed pellets. As the floundering 
horses vanished in the sudden wall of water, rock and mud, Uqualla was certain 
they would drown. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the water made the pellets swell, causing the sacks to burst open. 
Free of weight, the frightened horses scrambled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Holmeyer, a kindergarten teacher at the Havasupai School, was one of those 
hiking down the solitary eight-mile trail when the flood struck on Labor Day 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like it was a 50-foot torrent of water just going over and over and 
over," she said. After spending a fearful night stranded on a rock, she 
surveyed her surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see where the water had come," she said. "The trees were uprooted. 
The bridges were gone. The houses were leaning." 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the deluge, Havasupai tribal members are still uncertain how 
many horses and other livestock were lost, tribal chairman Don Watahomigie 
said. "The whole village has been pretty much in a panic," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A walking tour of Supai reveals the devastation. Several houses near the 
normally placid Havasu Creek took the full force of the flood and were knocked 
off their foundations or leveled. Few homes or gardens were spared. About a 
third of the 518 acres under cultivation was washed away. Everywhere the fences 
are down. Crops, saddles, blankets and other possessions are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Many families fled to the talus slopes and canyon walls high over the valley 
floor and are only now returning to their muddied homes after camping there 
most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Only twice before in memory -- in 1910 and 1928 -- has a flood this size 
thundered down the narrow canyon where the Havasupai Indians have made their 
home in the Grand Canyon since the 1300s. 
</P>
<P>
To the thousands of tourists who visit every year, Supai is a lush paradise in 
a narrow place. Generally cut off from the outside world, the tiny village of 
700 Indians is a world-renowned destination for its high, red canyon walls, 
majestic tall cottonwood trees and its clear, blue-green creek from which the 
people take their tribal name. 
</P>
<P>
But after the hourlong rainstorm last Monday sent a 14-foot wall of water down 
Havasu Creek and through the village, it turned the peace of the place to 
terror for visitor and resident alike. 
</P>
<P>
"The area around this Supai village is flat, semi-arid desert," explained 
Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards. "The surrounding area of perhaps more 
than 2,000 square miles and its drainage canyons, all feed into two major 
canyons, into Hualapai Canyon and into Cataract Canyon. Those two canyons feed 
right down into the village of Supai." 
</P>
<P>
When the flood began, Roland Manakaja said, his family went to see how quickly 
the creek was rising, only to be left with too little time to head for higher 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It rose so fast that within five minutes it was already up to our house," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wanna Manakaja, his mother, who lives next door, said her granddaughter was 
crying and screaming that the family's hens had been washed away. "She said to 
me, 'Grandma, Grandma, our chickens are all died.' " 
</P>
<P>
While the creek was at flood stage, the gathering rain on the plateau above 
found its way into little-used washes and turned three huge notches on the 
cliffs hundreds of feet above the village into thundering waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
In the half-mile wide valley, the tiny village held on under 18 inches of water 
at its shallowest point and perhaps 20 feet at its deepest. Everything loose in 
the path of the flow was washed over the three famous waterfalls below the town 
and down the 11 miles to the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Tribal ranger Clayton Watahomigie said he went down to the campground at dusk 
to warn tourists to evacuate and was caught in the flood himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to climb up a tree," he said. "When it got lower, I swam across. It was 
about chest high." He said he saw huge cottonwoods tumbling end over end down 
the stream. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the flood was playing with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At first light Wednesday, Army National Guard helicopters evacuated 60 tourists 
and returned for 107 elderly tribal members and many young children. 
</P>
<P>
In calmer times, the village's single, shaded dirt lane leads past the cafe, 
store, post office, clinic, school, church, tribal offices and modest homes. 
There are no cars, no gas stations. Every family relies on horses, the only 
means of transportation to the canyon rim. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-week, though, the chop of Army helicopters has replaced the thud of 
hooves as water, food, animal feed, hand tools, medicines and empty sandbags -- 
80,000 pounds in all -- are delivered. The single trail to the village is still 
impassable. Telephone service and electricity were quickly restored, but it 
will be weeks before the sewer, water and irrigation systems can be replaced, 
raising concern among health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the sewage is going down into the creek," said Dr. Philip Woodall, 
who fears an outbreak of disease. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their new problems, many Havasupais say the flood was a sign from 
nature regarding another threat the tribe has grappled with for years -- 
potential uranium mining. 
</P>
<P>
This spring a federal court cleared the way for a Denver-based mining company 
to sink a 1,500-foot shaft 35 miles east of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Havasupai have long feared that a flood such as this one would wash uranium 
tailings all the way into their canyon home to contaminate water and soil. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the devastation that we've experienced, it can be worse if the 
mines go in," said Roland Manakaja. "I'm thankful the mines aren't there. If 
they were, we probably wouldn't drink this water again."

that size thundered down the canyon where the Indians have lived since the 
1300s. To thousands of tourists, the town of Supai has been a picturesque haven 
dwarfed by the majestic canyon walls and cottonwood trees. But flood damage,

PORTS IN LOWER GULF SAY SHIPS FACE NO WAR RISK 
</P>

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its confidence bolstered by Western warships in the Persian Gulf, Dubai's 
busiest port is trying to convince London underwriters that war-risk insurance 
is no longer necessary in the lower end of the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suggesting they rezone the gulf into a realistic pattern," Dick Denning, 
marketing manager for Port Rashid, said Saturday. "We'd like to get some of 
those fellows out here to see how calm it is." 
</P>
<P>
When Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, the London underwriters, who handle the 
majority of the world's marine insurance, drew a line across the Strait of 
Hormuz and demanded war-risk riders for any ship going farther up the gulf. For 
a typical $50-million container ship, that meant $100,000 in extra premiums for 
insurance on the ship itself and higher premiums on cargoes as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Port Rashid Authority is proposing that the line be moved about 110 sea 
miles farther west to a point just beyond Abu Dhabi, which would place the 
ports of the United Arab Emirates in a risk-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
Denning said that the Emirates' ports have been getting bad press, and that 
there is no reason the shipping situation in the lower gulf should not be 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the underwriters are making their judgments based in part on the 
British press," he said at his port authority offices. "That's why we want to 
get them out here for a firsthand look." 
</P>
<P>
The Emirates' ports have clearly been affected by the confrontation in the 
gulf, however. On the dock at Port Rashid, for instance, 1,800 cargo containers 
ticketed for Kuwait sit undelivered, caught in a legal morass. They were aboard 
ships at sea when the Iraqis invaded and got no farther than Dubai. Other ships 
bearing Kuwait- or Iraq-bound cargoes were turned away, particularly those 
carrying cargoes such as steel and timber. 
</P>
<P>
Many cargoes had been sent CIF (cost, insurance and freight), which is the 
shipping equivalent of cash on delivery. With Kuwaiti importers hamstrung by 
frozen assets and other problems, a legal thicket has arisen over rights and 
payments on the cargoes. "It will be a real jungle to sort out who owns this 
stuff now," one gulf port official said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti business people who were overseas when their country was occupied are 
attempting to claim their consignments, but they don't have the paperwork. "All 
of their documents are in Kuwait," said Abdul Rahman Mutaiwee, head of the 
Dubai Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Denning rebutted reports that millions of dollars worth of meat and chocolate 
were rotting in refrigerated containers -- "reefers" -- on Emirate docks. "We 
have some Kuwaiti-bound reefers here," he said, but he showed a reporter how 
they were connected to electrical power and kept refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, 300 Kuwaiti containers have already been cleared from the 
docks, their cargoes presumably being reconsigned to Emirate importers for 
local distribution. "If the shipping line and an importer tell us they have an 
agreement, we move them out," he said. The remaining 1,800 represent a small 
fraction of the 30,000 containers now at Port Rashid, waiting for transshipment 
into the lower gulf markets. 
</P>
<P>
Port Rashid and Dubai's other big port, Jebel Ai, have been aggressively 
promoted in recent years and have made the sheikdom a key center for trade in 
the Middle East and beyond. Cargoes of containers, automobiles and general 
freight deposited in the tax-free ports are reshipped to ports in the Far East, 
India, East Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East.

RESERVIST CRASH VICTIMS SALUTED AS VOLUNTEERS IN CAUSE OF PEACE

With songs, prayers and tears, the families and friends of nine Air Force 
reservists killed in a military plane crash celebrated the airmen's lives 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Life was lost, but not in vain. It was given by volunteers who selflessly 
served the cause of peace and freedom in an unprecedented United Nations 
effort," Gen. Hansford T. Johnson told about 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 relatives of the men attended the ceremony in a hangar at Kelly 
Air Force Base. It followed two days of funerals for the officers and enlisted 
men, who were part of the 433rd Military Airlift Wing at Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were among 13 people killed Aug. 28 when a C-5A Galaxy cargo 
plane crashed and burned on takeoff at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. The 
plane was taking supplies to the Persian Gulf region under Operation Desert 
Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Wreaths decorated the hangar for the service. Patriotic songs recorded by Ray 
Charles and Elvis Presley resounded through the breezy building, and sunlight 
beamed in from one open side. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officers began the nondenominational service by placing neatly folded 
American flags beneath the identification tags of each of the dead reservists. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr. -- the only surviving 433rd reservist on the 
ill-fated flight -- placed a single red rose on each flag. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan, who has declined to give interviews since the crash, issued a statement 
Saturday, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I have suffered a great loss. Our flying squadron and wing has 
suffered an even greater loss. But the greatest loss falls on the families of 
our departed crew members." 
</P>
<P>
After the service -- concluded by an F-16 flyover in the "missing man" 
formation -- dozens of family members moved outside to look at and climb around 
on a C-5, described by the Air Force as the non-communist world's largest 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The 433rd reserve wing operates C-5s and has been taking part in the U.S. 
military buildup in the Middle East for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When the reservists were killed, their wing had not been called to active duty. 
The men were volunteers who had arranged time off from their civilian jobs to 
make the Middle East missions.

OUTRAGE OVER BREAD SHORTAGES UNDERMINING SUPPORT FOR SOVIET REFORMS;

Into the tiny guardhouse of the Zotov Bread Factory rushed a worker in 
shirt-sleeves despite the cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
"Open the gate," he commanded, gesturing toward the truck waiting outside to 
carry freshly baked loaves to the capital's stores. "People are left without 
bread!" 
</P>
<P>
People are left without bread. It is a terrifying sentence for a nation that 
lives on bread, that has come to consider it the one dependable product in the 
midst of an economy gone haywire, that sees it, as it has throughout history, 
as the symbol of well-being, even of life itself. 
</P>
<P>
For a Russian, a meal without bread is considered no meal at all, and that 
quick stop in the neighborhood bread store for a couple of loaves to put on the 
family table has been a central ritual of Soviet daily life for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The steady supply of bread, in fact, was an unwritten but inviolable Communist 
covenant with the people after decades of deprivation: No matter what happens, 
the party told them, you will always have bread; you will never go hungry 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But for a week now, the lines at Moscow bread stores -- those that still have 
anything to sell -- have snaked longer and longer, and the indignant panic has 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
"How can this be?" an outraged pensioner standing in line the other day at the 
capital's premier bread store on Kalinin Prospekt demanded. "They bring in a 
great harvest, and there's no bread in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon the windows in all the bread stores will be shattered," he predicted. 
"The people will rise up." 
</P>
<P>
As President Mikhail S. Gorbachev prepares to launch a radical new economic 
program and Moscow readies equally daring plans to turn the city into an island 
of virtual capitalism, the bread shortage is costing the reformers in power 
desperately needed public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We curse Gorbachev and the Moscow Council," an old man in a cap said as he 
packed away the two loaves of bread he had bought after a half-hour wait. "We 
should have thought before electing them." 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev's new reform program to succeed, he must have active support from 
a populace that believes in the future enough to invest energy in it and to 
tolerate the new hardships that it will bring at first. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to be presented this week, the reform program moves the country away 
from a state-owned, centrally planned economy by instituting a mass selloff of 
government property to private citizens and a gradual shift to higher, 
free-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the bread shortage is unfortunate, and "the psychological damage 
is enormous," Yuri M. Luzhkov, chairman of the Moscow City Council's executive 
committee and the head of the capital's new Anti-Crisis Committee, said. "We 
should have avoided it." 
</P>
<P>
City officials reported midweek that there had -- so far -- been no violent 
incidents connected with the bread shortage, none of the street protests dubbed 
"tobacco rebellions" that broke out nationwide over cigarette shortfalls this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet populace is famed for its stoic patience, but politicians learned 
the lesson earlier this year that they must not tamper with bread. 
</P>
<P>
When Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov proposed tripling the price of a loaf -- 
now cheap at about 30 cents for a loaf that weighs more than two pounds -- he 
triggered such an outcry and rush of panic buying that the government had to 
back off. 
</P>
<P>
"Bread is the foundation of a person," said a man in a slow-moving line of 
shoppers waiting to buy the hard bread rings that Russians dunk in their tea. 
"We can be without anything -- without sugar -- but not without bread. A person 
without bread is like cattle without hay." 
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said that 25% of the city's bread stores were empty or under-stocked; 
other estimates put the shortfall at approximately the amount of bread consumed 
daily by 300,000 Muscovites. Outside Moscow, shortages have been reported in a 
number of provincial towns, but none appear to be as severe as that in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov pledged last week that the bread crisis would pass within the next few 
days as all the baking industry's idle ovens are fired up. Those responsible 
for the shortage will be punished, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our problem, and it's our fault," Luzhkov told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov has proposed that hundreds of soldiers be brought in 
to help bake and transport bread. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, acting to ensure that the government's low grain supply does not 
cause bread shortages in the future, ordered regional leaders to guarantee that 
farmers deliver the grain they have promised to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow officials predicted that the head of the city's bread industry would be 
fired, but otherwise, this shortage -- like so many others -- appeared to be 
the fault of everybody and nobody, a natural phenomenon for an economy in the 
process of falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began when hundreds of thousands of Muscovites swarmed back into 
the city from their countryside vacations. The baking industry was prepared for 
a jump in demand, but it exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
So many other foodstuffs are now in short supply, including vegetables and 
meat, that people are eating more bread to compensate, Luzhkov said, explaining 
the unanticipated demand. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the new shortage spread, Muscovites began buying twice or three 
times more bread than they normally do: storing it, drying it into toast so 
that it has a long shelf life or freezing it. 
</P>
<P>
All that has driven up demand, and the cycle of shortage, stockpiling and even 
greater shortages was again under way. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers tend to have their own theories about the shortage's origins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Mafia," said Yelena Yelkina, one of scores of people waiting in the 
Kalinin Prospekt store for the next batch of loaves. Many of those waiting 
nearby agreed, supporting the popular belief that shady figures purposely 
create shortages, either to profit from the resulting black market or to bring 
on the downfall of those in power and put in their own people. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Askold Tarusin blamed the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"With the principles it ruled by, it brought us here, and this is the result," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Years of neglect that came with a system in which no one felt personally 
responsible -- the Russians call it "lacking a master" -- have clearly taken 
their toll on the bread-baking industry, as on other segments of the Soviet 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
When the shortage arose and officials asked why production could not be 
increased immediately, it turned out that 21 bread production lines were 
standing idle for want of modernization and repair, and that much of the city's 
baking equipment was more than 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The Zotov Bread Factory in central Moscow is one of the more sorry examples. 
</P>
<P>
The giant "1931" drawn on its brick walls may have connoted progress 60 years 
ago, but these days it means machinery so hopelessly antiquated that, according 
to director Vasily Molodykh, the factory's biggest production line has been out 
of order for four years. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its emergency measures, the Moscow City Council has ordered the idle 
line restarted within three days. "We have to do it," Molodykh said. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which operates Moscow's bakeries, is also trying to attract more and 
better workers to the manpower-starved industry by doubling their salaries from 
about $320 a month to about $700. 
</P>
<P>
The worsening shortage has also prompted proposals to ration bread or raise 
prices, Moscow City Council member Yuri Khramov said, but he warned that price 
increases "would bring exactly the blood on the streets that we don't want." 
</P>
<P>
For all their grumbling and the dire predictions, Soviet consumers for the most 
part still seem far from violence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Kalinin Prospekt store, Tarusin said that if the bread shortage gets 
worse, "We'll learn to suck our paws like a bear. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have substitutes, like potatoes," Tarusin added. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov announced earlier that the city was running about 120,000 tons short of 
the stores of potatoes it needs for the winter.

Voters in Albania will be given some freedom of choice, but the ruling 
Communists will maintain tight control over the election process, that 
country's leader says. 
</P>
<P>
In comments made available Saturday, Communist Party leader Ramiz Alia also 
hinted that wide-ranging changes may be necessary to accelerate economic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Without combating red tape, without being freed from the old management 
complexes . . . the hindrances we are coming across cannot be eliminated," Alia 
said in a speech to legislators and officials of organizations supervised by 
the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Albania in recent months has sought to usher in modest reforms and shed its 
image as a hermit country and Europe's last bastion of hard-line Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining planned election legislation, Alia said it would give all citizens 
the right to stand for office except those "expressly deprived of this right by 
law." He did not indicate who would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Balloting would be secret and there would be two nominees for each precinct. 
The right to nominate candidates would be granted to the party, trade unions 
and other groups, Alia said. 
</P>
<P>
But the party controls all public organizations in Albania, and it is unlikely 
the elections could pose a political threat to current rulers.

LITTLE PROGRESS AT MEETING TO UNIFY EUROPEAN CURRENCY; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY: FINANCE MINISTERS OF 12 EUROPEAN COMMUNITY NATIONS DISCUSS WAYS TO 
ACHIEVE MONETARY UNION. THEY ARE FAR FROM A CONSENSUS.

<P>
Europe's finance ministers, stumbling on the path to economic unity, emerged 
Saturday from an all-day meeting as divided as ever on whether and how to 
transform the moneys of the 12 nations of the European Community into a single 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said he won new sympathizers for 
his go-slow approach to monetary union. "Of the 12," Major said after the 
meeting, "nine in one form or another saw some merit in elements of our 
proposals." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Otto Pohl, director of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, was asked 
whether the meeting advanced the cause of monetary union. "Not at all," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Guido Carli, as host to the session, claimed that 
"some progress has been made in identifying ways in which differences can be 
met." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that the 12 finance ministers were far from a consensus on all 
the delicate issues involved in abandoning such currencies as the British 
pound, the German mark and the French franc. 
</P>
<P>
EC President Jacques Delors proclaimed himself optimistic that European heads 
of state could advance the cause of monetary union when they meet in Rome in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Delors is the author of a 1989 report urging movement toward a single European 
currency promptly after the 12 EC nations create a single market for goods and 
services as of Jan. 1, 1993. A single currency, in Delors' view, would bind the 
European economies more closely together and eliminate the cost of exchanging 
money from one currency to another as it crosses borders. 
</P>
<P>
Although France and some of Europe's smaller nations have signed on to the 
Delors formula, officials in Germany and, more particularly, Britain have 
balked. 
</P>
<P>
Pohl, less favorably disposed toward currency union than German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, has argued that Germany's vigilantly anti-inflationary monetary 
policy might fall victim to a common monetary policy for all of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has warned that to accept a common 
European currency would be to abandon an important aspect of national 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Major launched an alternative proposal to establish not a 
single currency for all of Europe but a pan-European currency that could be 
used even as the existing 11 currencies (Belgium and Luxembourg share the 
Belgian franc) stayed in use. 
</P>
<P>
A single European currency cannot work, Major said after Saturday's meeting, 
unless all nations adopt matching economic policies. Although conceding that 
none of the other finance ministers supported the British position in full, he 
said many of them expressed support for elements of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 EC members range from the German juggernaut to the relatively weak 
economies of Greece and Portugal, and Major said the weaker nations would face 
massive unemployment and a collapse of asset values if they were yoked to the 
tight monetary policies that the larger European nations would demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Major insisted that the goal of a single currency is not dead. 
</P>
<P>
"All that has happened," he said, "is that people are coming upon some of the 
hard practicalities."

Nobel laureate Mother Teresa, who five months ago announced her retirement 
because of ill health, was reelected Saturday as head of the Missionaries of 
Charity order she founded in 1950, a church official said. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the election suggested that the 80-year-old Roman Catholic nun 
has decided to continue to work among the impoverished people of the teeming 
Indian metropolis of Calcutta, ignoring medical advice to curtail her 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sisters of the organization greeted her reelection by holding a special prayer 
to mark the occasion. "We are exceedingly happy because of the mother's 
reelection. She is our mother, and we are her children," one sister said. 
</P>
<P>
Vicar-General Francis Gomes, a representative of the Archbishop of Calcutta, 
said that Mother Teresa was reelected in a secret ballot by 103 delegates 
representing 3,046 Missionaries of Charity nuns from around the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
An argument between two south Orange County teen-agers on a sunny beach here 
ended Saturday with one man shot dead and the another in custody, the Sheriff's 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place about 1 p.m. in an area known as Dana Strand, at the 
southern tip of county-run Salt Creek Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. William Francis said deputies responded to reports of a shooting 
on the beach, where they found bystanders giving first aid to an 18-year-old 
Dana Point man who had been shot. Paramedics transported the man to a nearby 
hospital, where he was reported dead on arrival. The man's identity was 
withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses gave deputies a description of the suspect and the vehicle he was 
driving. A 16-year-old Laguna Niguel youth, whose name is being withheld 
because he is a juvenile, was arrested without incident in San Juan Capistrano, 
Francis said. The suspect was being questioned by sheriff's deputies in Santa 
Ana, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses gave the following account: 
</P>
<P>
The two were apparently involved in a running dispute that began before 
Saturday over a pickup truck window that had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was walking down a bluff toward the area in the sand where the 
suspect and a group of friends were sitting. The suspect saw the victim walking 
toward him and pulled a small-caliber, short-barrelled pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect shouted, "Leave the beach or I'll kill you. I'll kill you if you 
come after me. I don't want to kill you, just leave." The victim replied, "Just 
pay me for the window." 
</P>
<P>
The two continued their shouting match as they headed north along the strand, 
the victim pursuing the youth with the gun. The suspect turned and pulled the 
trigger, hitting on an empty chamber. He ran again, then turned, went to his 
knees and fired again, hitting the victim in the chest, police said.

BEIRUT FRAGMENTS; A WAR MEMOIR BY JEAN SAID MAKDISI (PERSEA BOOKS: $19.95; 265 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Rieff, Rieff is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Said Makdisi is all too well aware that the world has given up on Beirut, 
the city to which she came in 1972 with her husband, a professor at the 
American University, and their children, and in which she stubbornly remains. 
</P>
<P>
For most outsiders, even that dwindling number who can still muster the moral 
energy to mourn for Beirut, the city's martyrdom has come to seem less a 
tragedy than a Hobbesian tale of undifferentiated brutality masquerading as 
politics and war. And how is the onlooker, no matter how scrupulous and 
well-intentioned, to make sense of a situation in which, as often as not, the 
people who were massacring each other last year have become allies today, and, 
doubtless, will become enemies again tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, the ideological and religious explanations that usually 
are advanced come to seem like obfuscations, the refuge of scoundrels, or, at 
least, of foreign correspondents on tight deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Like all disasters that, in our impatient age, go on and on without 
amelioration, or even the prospect of amelioration -- and Beirut is a 
paradigmatic situation of this type -- Lebanon is commonly thought to belong to 
that special category of events that simply defy rational understanding, 
limiting cases in our "can-do" world. In all likelihood, any ongoing tragedy in 
a foreign place toward which few of us, even in a country as heterogeneous as 
America, have any sentimental attachments can be understood only through the 
evocation of ordinary experience. For although peoples may refuse to concede 
the humanity of other people (in any case, there can be few groups more 
estranged from each other at present than Americans and Arabs), individuals 
have a much easier time imaginatively, at least when called upon to apprehend 
the particulars of a situation rather than its politics. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest accomplishment of this profound, heartbreaking book is that, 
through Makdisi's eyes, it is possible to rid one's mind of all the cant and 
rubbish that has been spoken about Beirut, and to see what has happened to that 
city not as a nightmare, with all the connotations of otherness and unreality 
which that world implies, but as a terrible human possibility. Makdisi begins 
her book with a bleak act of self-interrogation. "How can I write about 
Beirut?" she asks. Her reply should put to rest, once and for all, those 
comfortable, distancing stereotypes about Middle Eastern politics, the Arab 
character, and religious obsession that for too long have passed for profundity 
about the Lebanese catastrophe. "Beirut," Makdisi writes, "was a city like any 
other and its people were a people like any other. What happened there could, I 
think, happen anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Makdisi, like so many people who lived in Beirut before the 
beginning of the Lebanese Civil War, tends to idealize the city. It was, she 
claims, a place that combined "the famous generosity of Arab hospitality with 
cosmopolitan sophistication," a place where intermarriage between members of 
religious sects was not uncommon, where culture flourished and harmony 
prevailed. In Makdisi's view, even the confessional system under which 
political power was apportioned along sectarian lines was beginning to atrophy. 
</P>
<P>
To Makdisi's credit, she is aware of her own romanticizing tendencies. She 
tells a story of standing on her balcony on New Year's Eve, 1974, and watching 
young men from the slums snake through her middle-class street. "They wore 
paper hats and threw streamers," she writes, "often interspersed with cans and 
bottles picked up from the rubbish, thus burlesquing the more elegant parties 
that were taking place behind closed doors in homes and nightclubs throughout 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
She notes that "I felt a deep alarm that night, sensing that their celebration, 
although apparently good-humored, was not entirely so; that the line between a 
laughing crowd and an angry mob was a fine one, and that it took the merest 
spark to transform one into the other." The fighting, of course, broke out only 
four months later and Beirut began to die. 
</P>
<P>
Makdisi's rare combination of love for Beirut and keen awareness of its 
contradictions have much to do with her particular background. She was born in 
Jerusalem, into a prosperous Palestinian Christian family that fled in 1948. 
The Saids (Makdisi's brother is writer Edward Said) settled in Cairo, where the 
children were educated in English schools and confirmed in the All Saints 
cathedral, in Makdisi's case by the Anglican Archbishop of the Middle East. 
Thus, Makdisi belongs to the last generation in the Arab world to have had a 
colonial education, one in which, as she puts it, "living in Egypt, being part 
of it, was a secondary reality; real life was defined as centered on the 
British Isles." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she left Cairo to go to university in the United States, where she 
remained for 14 years. It was there, she recounts -- as much,it seems, as a 
reaction to the anti-Arab feeling that she encountered -- that she began to 
feel a part of Arab as well as Western culture. Thus, Beirut, when she returned 
there in the early '70s with her Lebanese-born husband, at first was ideal, a 
place where West and East "seemed to enjoy a peaceful coexistence." 
</P>
<P>
But "Beirut Fragments" is, of course, the story of how this harmony was 
destroyed. The book is aptly titled, and its best sections are diaristic 
descriptions of what it was like to live in the city as it collapsed. Above 
all, Makdisi's Beirut is a city in which people keep trying to behave normally. 
The life of neighborhoods is reproduced in bomb shelters; people sweep the 
streets free of rubble even during the fiercest bombardments, knowing full well 
that their work will be undone when the guns begin again the following day; 
children are sent to school. 
</P>
<P>
Makdisi cannot entirely explain why she stays on. In part, her decision appears 
to be an act of faith, a stubborn refusal to abandon Beirut because to do so 
would be to abandon hope itself. But one gets the feeling reading Makdisi's 
book -- which is not the polished work of a writer but an anguished cry of the 
heart -- that the Christian schoolgirl she once was also had a say in her 
decision, and that remaining in Beirut is, for her, an act of witness. She 
herself speaks of commitment, of solidarity, of loyalty and, paradoxically, of 
anger, of what she calls a "furious defense of the collective humanity so 
outraged in Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical people doubtless will come to the conclusion that Makdisi's gesture 
is a futile one, and indeed, her closing evocation of a Beirut at peace is at 
once the noblest and the most unpersuasive paragraph in the entire book. 
Perhaps the skeptics are right. But then again, it is precisely Makdisi's kind 
of lofty, almost perverse nobility that has marked the lives of spiritual 
people since the days of the early church. 
</P>
<P>
In a time in America where, despite all the professions of faith that can be 
found everywhere, few people seem to believe in much of anything, Makdisi's 
example is worth pondering, her words worth listening to, and her faith in 
humanity worth emulating.

<P>
BENEDICT ARNOLD; PATRIOT AND TRAITOR BY WILLARD STERNE RANDALL (WILLIAM MORROW: 
$25; 706 PP.; 1-577-10034-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anthony Bailey, Many of Bailey's books are on Anglo-American subjects, 
including the recent novel Major Andre (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For readers who keep up with Revolutionary War studies, two questions are 
immediately posed by this book. At 706 pages plus index, what does it tell us 
about the nascent republic's most infamous renegade that we do not know from 
"Traitorous Hero," Willard M. Wallace's skillful 1954 biography of Benedict 
Arnold, which was little more than half as long? What fresh insights does it 
provide into the events of the summer and early autumn of 1780, when, despite 
the French alliance, the fortunes of the discordantly united new nation once 
again hung in the balance (moments acutely examined in Carl van Doren's "Secret 
History of the American Revolution" and James T. Flexner's "The Traitor and the 
Spy")? The answers -- for this reader -- are, to the first question, not a lot, 
and, to the second, not many. Yet the subject remains compelling. Read on! 
</P>
<P>
Arnold was a brilliant opportunist whose energy, judgment and luck in the heat 
of crisis carried him far but finally failed to hold. A Connecticut boy, son of 
a well-to-do Norwich merchant who became an impoverished drunk, and a religious 
mother with strict notions about how young Benedict should grow up, he seems to 
have been a pushy, irascible fellow from early on. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteering for military jaunts was preferable to apprenticeship in an 
apothecary shop. Trading to the West Indies served his ambitions better than 
staying behind a New Haven counter. The upsurge of dissidence against the 
mother country handed him a vehicle for his belligerent ardor and for what was 
quickly evident as innate military ability. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time when all sorts of patriotic amateur soldiers and wheeler-dealers 
on the make found themselves serving together, and the chances of damaging 
dispute were often as strong among the rebels as between the rebels and the 
king's forces. Even so, particularly massive quarrels attended Arnold, even on 
his greatest exploits: the taking of Ticonderoga; the march through Maine to 
Quebec; the naval check given to Carleton on Lake Champlain, and the battles of 
Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was military governor of Philadelphia, he had been twice wounded 
in the leg by the British and possibly more wounded in pride by American 
questioning of his ethics and accounts. His enthusiasm for success as a 
revolutionary major general was matched by his fierce disgruntlement with 
Congress and the Pennsylvania authorities. 
</P>
<P>
And then he met Peggy Shippen, young enough to be his daughter, a pretty belle 
who, during the British occupation of the city, had charmed many young British 
officers, including John Andre, now aide to Gen. Sir Henry Clinton in New York. 
It continues to be a moment when one feels almost sorry for Arnold. Knowing as 
we do how the story turns out, delicious Peggy seems to represent his doom. 
</P>
<P>
Randall clearly has done an immense amount of research. Every byway of Arnold's 
saga is diligently examined. Some of this detail becomes irksome, as in his 
discussion of the Old Light versus New Light religious rivalries in New 
England, or the three pages devoted to Andre's pageant, given when the British 
pulled out of Philadelphia. On the arduous march to Quebec, Randall's trees 
often obscure his woods and the reader feels as lost as Arnold's hungry troops, 
lugging their heavy bateaux. 
</P>
<P>
A writer with panache might not provoke these criticisms, but the pace of 
Randall's writing rarely rises above a steady trudge, with occasional stumbles. 
A bullet which wounds Arnold is confusingly described as "flattened and sharp." 
At one point, Randall tells us that Gen. Gates approved a plan of Arnold's on 
Oct. 3; eight pages later he says that Gates hadn't yet sent his approval four 
weeks after Sept. 18, which I reckon to be Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
He writes of "a highway from Canada north toward Albany," leading us more than 
somewhat astray. He attributes the nautical invention of the drop keel or 
centerboard to the year 1776, although it usually is granted to the Chinese, 
centuries before, if not to early Colonial boat builders on the Chesapeake. The 
impression of a writer at an insufficient distance from his mountainous notes 
is enhanced by the introduction of characters we have already met a few lines 
before, and Arnold on several occasions being assigned the wrong age. 
</P>
<P>
As for the pivotal figure of John Andre, he does not captivate Randall as he 
has done other authors. Fair enough. But on matters of age, Randall is mistaken 
in regarding Andre at 21 years of age, before he joined the army, as "a fixture 
in England's literary society." It is questionble whether Andre was a culprit 
rather than simply an agent for Gen. Grey in the filchings of Benjamin 
Franklin's possessions. Randall calls Andre by turns wealthy and penurious. It 
is hard to take seriously his hints at a "homosexual affair" between Andre and 
Clinton, for which there is in fact no evidence (or even suggestion in the 
so-called gossip Randall prints as apparent testimony). Andre was re-buried in 
Westminster Abbey, but not in Poets' Corner. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these considerable demurs, Arnold's demon draws us along. Even his foes 
felt the attraction. Lord Germain in Whitehall called him "an enterprising 
man." To the Indians he was Dark Eagle. Gen. William Maxwell, a fellow American 
but no friend, wrote of him as "our evil genius" after Arnold -- at the cost of 
many of his own craft -- had brilliantly thwarted the superior British fleet on 
Lake Champlain. (The historian Alfred T. Mahan credited the success of Saratoga 
to the year of grace gained by this action at Valcour Bay.) 
</P>
<P>
Randall's description of this naval engagement is well done. So is his 
painstaking examination of Arnold's bookkeeping. Although he brings in new 
evidence that Arnold didn't fiddle the accounts of his Canadian expedition, he 
leaves unchanged our impression that, with his army salary greatly in arrears, 
Arnold never ceased being a merchant-trader, even a privateer, looking after 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Randall rightly stresses two factors which would affect Arnold's loyalty. 
Congress made the drastic error of passing him over for promotion and hurting 
his easily hurt feelings. Washington curiously appointed him governor of 
Philadelphia, where he was soon at odds with the local politicians, living a 
high life he couldn't afford and pursuing Peggy Shippen. 
</P>
<P>
He might well have served the American cause best if he had been allowed to 
follow his amphibious bent, given a fleet and raiding parties and a chance of 
prize money. As it was, his wounded leg gave him pain -- which may have 
affected his judgment. He was reprimanded by Washington for misusing his 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, newly married to Peggy, he saw the New World rights of property-owning 
and money-making for which he had gone to war being diminished by his fellow 
Americans. Perhaps he was totally exasperated by their inability to work 
together to keep armies in the field -- fed, paid, clothed and properly 
commanded. 
</P>
<P>
While taking us through all this, step by meticulous step, Randall never quite 
brings this difficult, apparently unlikeable man to life. What, for instance, 
did Peggy see in him -- a middle-aged man with a limp? 
</P>
<P>
Although Randall lays out the available information and clearly retells the 
tale of the conspiracy with Andre, he has difficulty, as others have done, in 
converting Arnold from "patriot" to "traitor" -- in getting us to understand 
this leap, which would have allowed him to surrender West Point, "the key to 
America," as Washington called it, and possibly facilitate Washington's 
capture. Perhaps one reason for this is that Arnold was never entirely a 
patriot or a traitor (terms that require only a letter changed and a slight 
rearrangment to turn one into the other). He kept using the phrase "conscious 
of my own rectitude" and it was the "my own" that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he went over to the British, and Andre was hanged, Arnold remained 
contrary. He took all the blame for his action; he continued to haggle about 
money. He went on being tactless -- praising Washington, damning British 
inactivity. He gave Cornwallis perceptive advice not to base his army at 
Yorktown. He went on eagerly seeking conflict, and his customary battle fury 
brought about a great bloodletting on his home river, the Connecticut Thames. 
</P>
<P>
The closing years, in Canada and London, were not a success, apart from an 
initial welcome from the king. He sired an illegitimate son in Nova Scotia; all 
the other sons of the man who had been America's most effective fighting 
general became British army officers. Peggy stood by him to the last.

RICHARD EDER: CHALLENGING THE ACQUIESCENCE OF ULSTER; 
</P>
<P>
LIES OF SILENCE BY BRIAN MOORE (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95; 200 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is all there, perhaps too plainly there, in the title. Brian Moore has 
written an angry political novel that is also a novel of suspense. The suspense 
is intricately tangled in an impossible moral choice, faced by a Northern 
Irishman who struggles to resign from his country's conflict, and cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Impossibility is the curse of the politics that has made Ulster's history a 
strangled gyre that grinds away, decade after decade, sinking but never sinking 
through. And it is the focus of Moore's anger. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is a prolific novelist who has written on a variety of themes since he 
got out of his native Belfast, young, in 1948. Belfast -- Catholic Belfast, 
specifically -- is not out of him, though. "Lies of Silence" is his phrase for 
the mental and moral excusing and evading that allow the Irish Republican Army 
to operate out of the Catholic community, even though Catholics will deplore 
its violence, or at least, the seeming hopelessness of its violence. 
</P>
<P>
Acquiescence in the face of evil is the charge Moore brings against the 
minority population of the North. He barely mentions the Protestant majority, 
and the British appear only in the form of a cool and barely glimpsed security 
official. The author's quarrel is with the sentimentality that allows his 
Catholics to wink at present atrocities in the name of past heroics. His target 
is Mother Machree. She'll kill you, the message goes; and in "Lies of Silence," 
she does. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dillon is civilized and apolitical, the successful manager of a Belfast 
hotel that is owned by an American chain. He hopes for promotion to one of the 
chain's London hotels; he cannot wait to get out of the city he was born and 
reared in. 
</P>
<P>
London means a decent life and escape. Escape, also, because he will leave 
Moira, his gloomy and sub-hysteric Belfast wife, and go live with uncomplicated 
Andrea, a researcher for the BBC. Escape, finally, out Europe's last medieval 
war, and into Europe of the Common Market and no-fault history. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Michael is about to take off, his house is seized by an IRA gang. With 
Moira as their hostage, and under threat of death, Michael must drive a 
bomb-rigged car into his hotel parking lot -- as manager, he will not be 
searched -- where a time-device is to detonate and kill a lot of people, 
including an Ian Paisley-like Protestant extremist who is attending a lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Lies of Silence" is tightly, sometimes breathtakingly, constructed around the 
dilemmas that ensue. If Michael warns the police, he threatens Moira's life. If 
he does not, he risks the lives of dozens of others. (One of the ingenious 
half-turns on this dilemma is that he cannot be sure if there is a dilemma. The 
IRA itself may or may not have given a warning; his captors will not say.) 
</P>
<P>
The painful but undoubtedly correct choice is to sacrifice one life -- perhaps 
-- instead of many -- perhaps. Except that Moira's death would also be highly 
convenient. And Michael twists in the arid scruples of choice and conscience of 
a sort that Graham Greene wrote about more finely in "The Heart of the Matter" 
and "The Power and the Glory." 
</P>
<P>
It is Moore's skill to give a living answer to this moral puzzle. No normal 
human being, much less a scrupulous one, could abide doing nothing, however 
finely balanced the choices. The hotel is bombed; its guests are evacuated in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
A moral dilemma, however, now turns political as well. Moira, too gruesomely 
whiny up to now to matter much, suddenly becomes real. She and Michael, 
Catholics but uninvolved, must make new choices. He will go to London, the 
longed-for escape now justified by police warnings that he is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Moira, on the other hand, refuses "to let them push me out." She will stay and 
denounce the IRA on television. In the book's most effective confrontation, she 
lets Michael know that if he was willing to see her die to stand up against the 
terror, she is willing to lose him to another woman to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Even in London, though, Michael is not free. He had recognized one of the 
gunmen; the police ask him to make the identification. A priest with IRA 
connections comes over, ostensibly to plead mercy for the son of a parishioner. 
"A lovely woman," he calls her. As for the youth: "You know what these lads are 
like, they're just kids." As if mercy were all that was at stake, and the duty 
of any Catholic, even a sophisticate, was to exercise it exclusively with other 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
But the priest brings an unspoken message as well: The IRA will kill Michael if 
he talks. And he must decide finally whether he can escape the war and its 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
In a number of ways, "Lies of Silence" succeeds remarkably. On the level of 
sheer suspense, for example. It is marvelously canny. And if there is 
contrivance in using this suspense, and the dilemmas that nourish it, to open 
up a larger political and moral dimension, it seems well justified. 
</P>
<P>
Moore will be criticized for making his exclusive targets the IRA and the 
failure of most Catholics to confront the kind of choice that Moira and Michael 
are brought to. But he is not writing an overview of Northern Ireland; he has 
chosen, as is his right, to focus upon one aspect of its tragedy. If the 
chicken of majority oppression has laid the egg of minority violence -- which, 
in turn, hatches a violent Protestant chicken, and so on -- why, Moore has 
decided to tell an egg story. He tells it well. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he can be plodding in his prose. When Michael and Andrea 
arrive in London and enjoy a few days of happiness, Moore writes: "They were 
here. Everything had changed. Everything." 
</P>
<P>
He can also be crude in his characters, manipulating actions and discourse to 
make political points. The priest is oily and repulsive. Moore has cast a role 
instead of writing a character. 
</P>
<P>
It is all too convenient when Michael, driving the bomb-rigged car after the 
night of terror in his hijacked home, passes the Catholic school where he was 
taught to hate Protestants. It was "run by priests whose narrow sectarian views 
perfectly propagated the divisive bitterness which led to the events of last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
As the protagonist, Michael has moments of real substance when he truly 
embodies the dilemmas he is in. But he is given too much to do, to feel, to 
think; the agony that is the heart of the book is a busy agony, and the 
busy-ness weakens it.

TOLSTOY'S FINAL DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAST STATION BY JAY PARINI (HENRY HOLT: $21.95; 290 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward Condren, Condren is a professor of literature at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tolstoy was one of the greatest novelists in any language. As a man whose 
ideals often contradicted his life, he has a less certain reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Among his many idiosyncrasies, none seems more apparent, nor more responsible 
for tormenting his last months, than his habit of laying guilt upon others to 
atone for his own excesses; or, to turn the same coin on its opposite side, his 
fondness for half-baked ideals which actually arose from some personal 
inability. For example, though he was born to the wealthy, land-owning 
nobility, his opulence embarrassed him, since he believed -- and continually 
lectured those around him -- that to own property is to be a thief; yet the 
only possessions he ever tried to give away were the copyrights to his work, a 
gesture that could only have hurt others. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, his once-prodigious sexual appetite -- indeed 13 legitimate children 
and at least one illegitimate one were born at his huge estate, Yasnaya Polyana 
-- later influenced him to preach against all forms of sexual activity. Yet 
here, too, he did not so much surrender a comfort as find relief from a burden, 
for he was already an old man becoming increasingly estranged from Sofya 
Andreyevna, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most ironic of all, this consummate creator of intensely emotional 
characters eventually believed the novel a frivolous form, later abandoning it 
for the craft of essayist and philosopher, though he had often called analysis 
inferior to love. Yet it cannot be a coincidence that by this time he feared 
his creative powers had waned. 
</P>
<P>
In Tolstoy's last months, the most obvious manifestation of this attack of 
conscience, and coincidental evidence of his deteriorating marriage, was the 
battle between the author and his wife over the copyright to his works. Leo 
Nikolayevich wanted to atone for his own privileged birth by assigning the 
copyright to a publisher, Chertkov, a disciple who had promised to make the 
works available to the public in inexpensive editions. To Sofya Andreyevna, 
this was the worst kind of disloyalty -- failure to provide for his family's 
future, while preferring a hanger-on who would only enrich himself. A mortal 
battle developed, not between Chertkov and Sofya over the soul of Tolstoy, for 
Sofya had already forbidden Chertkov to set foot on Yasnaya Polyana, but 
between Tolstoy and his wife over which way Tolstoy would bestow his 
affections. 
</P>
<P>
"The Last Station" unfolds the fascinating story of these Dantean circles -- 
made by both Tolstoy and others -- that closed about Russia's then greatest 
writer and most outspoken critic during his last year. In his closest circle, a 
constant jockeying for the great man's quixotic affections alternated with 
sincere attempts to effect what these several people in their different ways 
deemed his best interest. Others were ruled by self-interest, as careers and 
incomes stood in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
And at the widest circle was the ruthless world beyond, hovering like birds to 
screech the latest scandal in Tolstoy's marriage, as it had done a decade 
earlier; gossiping that the celibate wife-murderer in "The Kreutzer Sonata" was 
an image of Tolstoy himself; or flapping in delight when some Tolstoyan 
disciple had been imprisoned for slandering the czar's government. And all the 
while everyone ghoulishly awaited news of Tolstoy's health. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Parini faithfully re-creates these events with the unusual technique of six 
narrators, all historical figures, who offer their perspectives of the 
day-to-day activities leading up to Tolstoy's death. As each chapter ends, a 
new narrator takes over. Chertkov has the fewest chapters, three; Tolstoy's 
doctor has four; his secretary-daughter five, and his wife eight. 
</P>
<P>
The largest role -- nine chapters -- and most attractive personality belong to 
a young writer whom Chertkov had sent to Tolstoy to be a kind of research 
assistant/spy. His name was Valentin Bulgakov (not to be confused with the 
near-contemporary Mikhail Bulgakov, author of "The Master and Margarita"). 
</P>
<P>
Several of these narrators believe that the overly dramatic Sofya became so 
unstable, and so obsessed with what she thought was her husband's sordid 
attraction for Chertkov, that she drove Tolstoy to leave her secretly in the 
middle of the night of Oct. 28, 1910, on a desperate journey that caused his 
death nine days later. This belief, however, overlooks some obvious facts. 
</P>
<P>
When he converted a domestic temper tantrum into a secret journey, Tolstoy was 
a man so advanced in years that his health was already precarious. Then, 
exploding the secrecy of his trip by sending letters and telegrams to everyone 
and by giving something of a public lecture on the train suggests that he was 
as much of a self-dramatizer as his wife. Moreover, this final journey, 
especially its first stop at a sparse monastery to visit his sister, a nun at 
the adjacent convent, may have appealed to Tolstoy as a symbolic rejection of 
the worldly possessions he had often philosophically disowned. 
</P>
<P>
Although a sub-title describes the book as "a novel of Tolstoy's last year" 
(Gore Vidal even calls it a historical novel), this may be a misleading 
category. For, apart from two poems signed J. P. and an unsigned sestina 
probably also by the same hand, the entire work is a tour de force of editing. 
As Parini himself says, the subject first suggested itself to him in a 
used-book shop in Naples while he was browsing through Bulgakov's diary of 
Tolstoy's last year. He later learned that Dr. Makovitsky wrote a book about 
his prominent patient; Sofya wrote extensively about these times; Tolstoy's 
daughter Sasha kept a diary. Even that archvillain (from Sofya's point of view) 
Chertkov published his version of these events. 
</P>
<P>
Having access to all of these first-hand accounts offers a splendid advantage: 
a variety of narrators giving authentic historical perspectives, many 
incompatible. But there are disadvantages as well. By presenting these voices 
twice removed from their original sounds -- once due to the translation from 
Russian to the English from which the author worked, and then in editing for 
continuity -- Parini gives us six narrators who sound very much alike. Some of 
this editing doubtless improves the book, as a brief look at Parini's sources 
clearly shows. (The colorless, blunt style of Andreyevna's diary required a 
more extensive editorial effort than did the interesting prose of Bulgakov, 
which was largely taken verbatim.) Nevertheless, the final result is not 
exactly a novel, with all that that term implies about an author's invention. 
</P>
<P>
One example of the author's skillful selection of material from the available 
diaries provides happy relief from what might otherwise have been a lugubrious 
chronicle of an old man's decline. Bulgakov, the young assistant, was staying 
at Telyatinki, a Tolstoy residence a few miles from Yasnaya Polyana, where he 
met and fell in love with Masha, another young Tolstoyan. The passages 
describing this affair, like fresh air let into a musty room, remind us of what 
the young Tolstoy must have been like when he was passionately in love with his 
22-year-old wife and the two of them worked together on "War and Peace," he 
writing new material a few pages at a time, she copying it in smooth draft and 
making suggestions along the way. Sofya often said that these were the happiest 
days of her life. 
</P>
<P>
In the contrast between the young lovers Bulgakov and Masha and the tired old 
warriors Tolstoy and Sofya we see, then, not only the beginning and end of one 
of the world's greatest artists but also the two facets of Tolstoy's life. This 
story is about deeply emotional people who were willing to sacrifice everything 
for each other, and the complicated life that Tolstoy himself actually led 
outside his art. By selecting the most interesting observations of people whose 
works we would perhaps never consult, in a novel that grows more compelling as 
it proceeds, Parini has made a valuable contribution to our understanding of 
Tolstoy. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, he confirms what we have always known in some subconscious way, 
but still need to learn: that we can always trust a great writer's works, never 
his commentary -- on anything.

THE NARRATIVE ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
THROUGH THE ARC OF THE RAIN FOREST BY KAREN TEI YAMASHITA (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS: 
$9.95, PAPER; 192 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Through the Arc of the Rain Forest" is a sermon on the evils of technology 
worship, media hype, metastasizing capitalism and environmental rape. 
Fortunately, it's also much more. It may be, for example, the only novel in 
existence to be narrated by a "personal satellite" -- a sentient sphere the 
size of a golf ball, whizzing around the head of a Japanese expatriate in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
He and five other characters -- an American industrialist with three arms, a 
Sao Paulo couple who raise homing pigeons, an old man who heals the sick with 
feathers, and a religious pilgrim -- converge on the Matacao, a mysteriously 
flat, smooth clearing in the Amazon basin. The floor of the Matacao proves to 
be made of plastic -- a bunghole for the world's accumulating wastes. The 
plastic has myriad uses and seems to be the ultimate technological fix, but 
efforts to exploit it lead to excess, frenzy, plague and ruin. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the sermon. The rest is humor and exuberant melodrama, a satire on 
science, philanthropy, marketing research, corporate climbing and pop 
evangelism. Karen Tei Yamashita, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and spent 
10 years in Brazil before returning to Gardena, says she modeled her story on 
the Brazilian soap operas, which are broadcast even to "the most remote towns, 
(where) a single television in a church or open plaza will gather the people 
nightly" to find out what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
This is Yamashita's first novel. As a playwright ("Hannah Kusoh: An American 
Butoh," "Omen: An American Kabuki"), she showed interest in crossing cultural 
lines. "Through the Arc of the Rain Forest" takes the process a step further. 
</P>
<P>
"I like ideas," Yamashita said in a 1989 interview in the newspaper Rafu 
Shimpo. "I don't like writing dialogue." This suggests an impatience with the 
fictional vehicle for those ideas, but "Through the Arc" doesn't show it: 
Besides remarkable speculative reach, it has OK dialogue (by soap-opera 
standards, at least), engaging characters, tight plotting and all the necessary 
regard for what happens next.

A HIGH CALLING; 
</P>
<P>
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BY JOHN BUCKLEY (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 386 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeff Silverman, Silverman, a former Herald Examiner columnist, is certain he 
lived through the '60s but doesn't quite remember it. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those Buckleys. How cheeky can a family get? 
</P>
<P>
All right, I admit it from the start: I've spent half a lifetime shielding 
myself from the Yahoo world view of Citizen William F. and the logorrhea he 
schleps with him. But I admit this, too: The guy's charm, wit, and overworked 
erudition can be thoroughly engaging. So what if his lips hardly move, his spy 
thrillers do. Now there's his second son's drug-themed second novel to contend 
with. 
</P>
<P>
So, caveat emptor and Liberals of the world, unite, because John Buckley has 
most assuredly been dunked in the same socio-political gene pool as his old 
man, but with a few serious adjustments we can be thankful for. First, Buckley 
fils writes a helluva lot better than Buckley pere. Second, the kid is much 
funnier and a good deal less self-righteous. But, more importantly, there's the 
younger Buckley's take on things, darkly comic and a shade askew. He's no mere 
ideologue. He understands that life overflows with moral ambiguities: "You 
didn't have to live in a city as wracked by crack as the District of Columbia," 
writes Buckley, ". . . to realize how things had changed from the days . . . 
when smuggling drugs into the country was a high calling, no pun intended, 
since it was a game no more serious in the larger questions it raised than 
moonshiners versus 'revenuers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, conservatives need not worry. His bloodline and partyline lean far 
enough to the right as to almost topple over. But while he served as a deputy 
press secretary to the '84 Reagan-Bush campaign before heading off to run the 
press staff for the Republican Congressional Committee, he's also toiled as a 
rock critic, a line item that begs a veto from most right-wing resumes. If John 
Buckley hasn't completely embraced what passes for culture in this the twilight 
of the 20th Century -- you know, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll -- he at least 
acknowledges its presence. Reading him, you get the picture he might have 
indulged a little himself. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he's a Buckley all right -- at times extreme right -- but with 
pretensions towards hipness. Things could be worse, no? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe not. Because what John Buckley has pulled off in "Statute of 
Limitations" is really a kind of cosmic joke. He's elected a sort of decent if 
weak-willed Democrat (for a Buckley, is there any other kind?) to the White 
House (a Democrat in the White House?), given him a speech writer with a very 
good heart and very bad judgment, and then embroiled the latter in a 
drug-running plot that's hinged on his drug-using past. 
</P>
<P>
What salvages "Statute of Limitations" is the question it raises about a 
generation's past drug use. "Statute of Limitations" is, of course, the phrase 
given for the time limit within which a crime can be prosecuted. Murder has 
none. Drugs do. But given America's vehement anti-drug temperament these days, 
just how long must the Baby Boomers be held accountable for their 
experimentation with recreational pharmaceuticals in the Good Old Days? 
</P>
<P>
The question's an important one, and will continue to be raised in the coming 
years. We've already seen one Supreme Court nominee shot down in part over his 
admission to smoking pot, and, in a Massachusetts election last year, several 
of the state's politicos -- from Sen. John Kerry, a decorated Viet Nam vet, 
down -- came clean with the fact that they'd blown some weed back when hair, 
and tolerance, both seemed a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
So, just when will the statute of limitations lapse on an activity that, 
illegal as it may have been, became a de facto part of life for a significant 
segment of the country's population now stepping into real roles of power and 
leadership? 
</P>
<P>
Until then, we are all potential prisoners to our pasts, law-abiding citizens 
forced to sneak around the back alleys of our lives for fear that someone, 
somewhere, might point a finger and say, "Remember when?" It is a scenario for 
emotional blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely the predicament Thomas O'Malley, subscriber to the old 
prep-school creed of "Admit nothing, deny everything" and speechwriter to the 
newlyelected Democratic president of the United States, finds himself in when 
his old Amherst roommate, David Nicole, former campus dealer extraordinaire, 
reappears with a scheme that almost results in the collapse of the presidency. 
O'Malley doesn't bring down the President, but, in the end, he does bring down 
the novel. 
</P>
<P>
He has to be one of the stupidest protagonists (and he's the first to admit how 
dumb he is) ever to wander between covers, petty in his fears, selfish in his 
ends, and constructed with the moral consistency of Jell-O (which is probably 
why a Buckley made him a Democrat). Moral ambiguity is one thing; the ability 
to make a decision in the face of danger to control your life is something 
else. Once events take control of him -- and they do -- it's not O'Malley's 
character but rather his luck, and the ability of a dogged, if thoroughly 
soused, suspended FBI agent in the right place at the right time that 
ultimately saves him. 
</P>
<P>
What saves "Statute of Limitations" is Buckley's own delicious wickedness. His 
portraits of White House back-stabbing, an over-preening press, and the marital 
woes of O'Malley's parents -- his father's an alcoholic former CIA operative; 
his mother's a bleeding-heart -- are finely detailed, drawn with wit and 
precision. So is the way Buckley counterpoints the ravages of alcohol abuse 
with the dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But what's most worthy here is that Buckley locked onto a question that needs 
to be grappled with by a society whose forgiveness tends to be selective. It's 
what keeps "Statute of Limitations" from ultimately going up in smoke.

For anyone who was around in the 1950s, when the medium of television was 
relatively new and hadn't yet become altogether defined, in Robert Hughes' 
phrase, as "wet-nurse to the culture," mere mention of the name Ernie Kovacs is 
enough to induce a near-paralysis of reverie. The Kapusta Kid, Percy 
Dovetonsils, the Nairobi Trio, Uncle Gruesome, the endlessly inventive bits 
that teased our naturalistic assumptions about time and space as viewed on the 
tube, the sheer sense of fun and gentle play that emanated from a Kovacs show, 
were wholly innovative then -- and unmatched since (though the Monty Python 
troupe has come close). 
</P>
<P>
At the center of an improbable world stood an improbable figure, a tall, soft 
man with a low, fond voice who smoked a big cigar, wore a vivid mustache, and 
whose eyes seemed forever fixed at the molten edge of a sweet Hungarian 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
It's been nearly 30 years since Kovacs was killed in an auto accident in 
Beverly Hills, and though there's been a resurgence of interest in his life and 
times over the past decade -- ABC television produced the 1984 "Ernie Kovacs, 
Between the Laughter," and in 1987 he was inducted into the Academy of 
Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame -- there's been almost nothing of 
substance written about him. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly we have two books: Diana Rico's "Kovacsland" is the more formal and 
detailed biography, with notes and appendixes; Edie Adams' autobiography, while 
revealing a woman of talent and conviction, does nothing to begrudge his place 
at the center of her life for as long as they knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
Both offer the biographical details of Kovacs' difficult start in life -- he 
was born in Trenton, N.J., in 1919 to Hungarian immigrant parents. His father 
was a bootlegger and restaurateur, which gave the young Ernie a taste for the 
high life that never was to leave him. His mother was an implacable scold who 
grew worse as time went on and never relinquished her grip on him even after he 
was married (she defied a court order by insisting on moving in with him and 
his family). He nearly starved while studying acting in Manhattan. Later he 
came down with pleurisy and pneumonia, and, owing to a medical mix-up, 
tuberculosis, all of which kept him confined for 18 months in a Welfare Island 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Rico gives an excellent thumbnail history of radio days in America, before 
Kovacs joined up with WTTM in Trenton as a disc jockey. In nearly no time he 
began changing the format to suit his penchant for anarchy and playfulness. 
He'd set fire to a news announcer's script; once he lowered a rubber spider on 
a string in front of a singer as she was performing -- she screamed on the air. 
In late 1949, he went to work as a staff announcer for WPTZ-TV in Philadelphia, 
and in March of 1950, with five minutes' notice, went on the air to host a 
cooking show called "Deadline for Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
In those days there would often be lots of time to kill, a perfect condition 
for Kovacs' love of invention. (Edie Adams, a fledgling singer from Tenafly, 
N.J., who was added to "Three to Get Ready" -- the first TV morning wake-up 
show in America -- also learned to wing it when Kovacs often arrived late to 
his own show.) He, and the medium, were growing up together; as his reputation 
expanded, so did the number of stations that hired him and the fans he picked 
up along the way. By the time he left New York for Hollywood in 1957, he'd 
worked for CBS, NBC, ABC and the Dumont network -- sometimes for more than one 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
While "Kovacsland" ably places him in a historic and cultural context, "Sing a 
Pretty Song" offers a more intimate insight into the life of Ernie Kovacs. 
</P>
<P>
Edie Adams was a highly disciplined and resourceful young woman with a 
developing theatrical career of her own before she met Kovacs. (She would later 
win a Tony Award for her role as Daisy Mae in "L'il Abner".) Although her book 
is somewhat uneven in the scope of its detail (as Rico's book is occasionally 
tentative when it doesn't have details to lean on), it's a straightforward 
story of an unavoidably difficult emotional life. She owns up to having failed 
his two daughters by a previous marriage (one of the most harrowing periods in 
Kovacs' life was when the girls' mother kidnaped them and hid them in Florida). 
Kovacs was unquestionably the love of Adams' life, but also the source of her 
greatest pain -- until the death of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Kovacs hated New York, but never enjoyed the brilliant screen success in 
Hollywood that he had had in television in the East. He was an extravagant, 
compulsive gambler. His battles with network brass and sponsors became more 
pitched. The IRS swept in to take 90% of the money he made. In both books, the 
sense of his mounting exhaustion and desperation becomes increasingly palpable 
so that, by the time he slipped behind the wheel of his Corvair that rainy 
night in January of 1962, he seemed to be an accident waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Kovacsland" and "Sing a Pretty Song" complement each other well, and let us 
warm again to this brilliant, impossible, endearing, lovely man.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Prohibition wars of the '20s and '30s roar through Detroit again as rival 
gangs (one of them Purple) fight over the turf and almost nobody on either side 
of the law stays untainted and incorruptible. No Eliot Ness here. Loren D. 
Estleman's Whiskey River (Bantam: $17.97; 272 pp.) stirs together historical 
research and entirely believeable invention, with only a brief preface to 
suggest what really happened and what might have but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of a young hood named Jack Dance (ne Danzig) is chronicled by 
reporter/columnist Connie Minor, who in those days consorted with the mobsters, 
trading discretion for scoops and knowing which news wasn't fit, or safe, to 
print. He is looking back on the events from his present role as an advertising 
writer in a wet-again city. 
</P>
<P>
From a gun battle at night on a frozen river as one gang tries to hijack 
another gang's caravan of touring cars sneaking illegal hooch in from Canada, 
to a final shoot-out when the music stops for Dance, Estleman's novel is a 
wizard piece of historical reconstruction, exciting as a gangster film but with 
a texturing of the characters and the times that rises well above genre. It is 
an exceptional piece of crime fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptional as well is Laurence Henderson's The Final Glass (Academy: $18.95; 
299 pp.), a tensely credible look within the Provos -- the Provisional Irish 
Republican Army -- as a small knot of them plot their explosive protests in 
present London. 
</P>
<P>
A bomb goes off on a double-decker bus trundling through the London night. It 
seems to have been purposeless, no evident target aboard and no apparent 
symbolic importance. The Yard commences its expert researches (the fragments 
identify the explosive as a brand the Provos have used before) and Henderson 
looks in on the local Provos, who are as confused as the police by the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Odd Man Out," Henderson's novel is a story of betrayal and corruption, 
reaching to the top of the organization. Increasingly, the story focuses on 
Maureen Driscoll, a university radical drawn to the IRA by what had seemed 
sufficiently idealistic reasons to her and her late husband, who presumably was 
gunned down by British troops during a bungled caper in Northern Ireland. She 
is in London as a kind of untrusted auxiliary to the male bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The double-crossings are as intricate as anything in early Le Carre; the 
confrontations are hair-raising, and Driscoll's fate a matter of high suspense 
and concern. Henderson, a British author whose fifth novel this is, has a 
narrative flair both non-stop and highly polished. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Rendell continues to be improbably prolific and clever and, as always, 
appears to set herself ever trickier tasks, just so she can make them look 
easy. In Going Wrong (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 260 pp.), her target is a 
fairly obviously addled and dangerous young man who has lunch every Saturday 
with a young woman he has known since they were children. 
</P>
<P>
He imagines she loves him (they were teen-age lovers, briefly). She doesn't, 
and is so aware of his unbalanced state that she's afraid not to keep their 
routine dates. In his obsession, whatever she does appears to him to confirm 
her love. Love is seldom quite this blind. 
</P>
<P>
As writing, it is a high-wire act, and Rendell executes it wonderfully well, 
generating much the same suspense you might feel in the presence of a coiled 
snake. All hell is going to break loose, but just when, and exactly how? She 
even manages to be tartly funny, as in the confrontations between the suitor 
and the girl's contemptuous mother. 
</P>
<P>
The denouement is sheathed in an irony that is saved for the very last page (by 
now a frequent Rendell trademark). Her vision is too dark for some readers, but 
no one is presently conducting more memorable tours de force than Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
There can hardly be an American lawyer these days who is not writing a 
courtroom thriller on the side. It must be the Turow lure. One of the latest -- 
and very good, too -- is Paul Levine, a Miami trial lawyer specializing in 
First Amendment cases. To Speak for the Dead (Bantam: $17.95; 282 pp.) is his 
first novel, with a second to be published in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers write about lawyers and Levine's hero is Jake Lassiter, a trial lawyer 
who occasionally suggests Travis McGee with an LL.B. His client is a dashing 
young doctor being sued for malpractice in the death during surgery of an 
elderly patient, whose sexy young wife does not seem as grief-stricken as she 
might and who is afflicted with indiscriminate hots. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers also write about judges and courtrooms, and the appeal of both is large 
and evidently unquenchable. Levine gets out of the courthouse to do a spot of 
grave-robbing with a very cinematic retired coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Irony also is perennially in vogue, and there is a hearty helping of it in the 
solution of Lassiter's case. After a shaky prologue, Levine finds his stride, 
and in the end, his debut novel is an assured and exciting piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
Crime-fiction writing has been a white near-monopoly but there are exceptions, 
and Gar Anthony Haywood is a recent one: an able black writer with a black 
hero. His "Fear of the Night" in 1987 won a $10,000 prize as the year's best 
first private-eye novel. Not Long for This World (St. Martin's: $17.95; 260 
pp.) is his second book and again features Aaron Gunner, the eye from the 
prize-winning original. 
</P>
<P>
Haywood, who lives in Los Angeles, takes the South-Central L.A. of the violent 
gang wars as his turf this time. A respected leader who has been trying to 
defuse the gangs is killed in a drive-by shooting. A Legal Aid attorney 
persuades Gunner to check out whether an accused gang member, who protests his 
innocence, is really guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Gunner finds a plot -- a near-demented plan to handle the gang problem in a 
euthanasian, Hitlerian way. As with the Provos, betrayal from within is again a 
strong plot element. But the real interest of Haywood's book is the realism of 
the speech, the gang life, the black-police, black-white relations (or 
non-relations), the despairing intensity of South-Central. The final shoot-out 
is a shocker, but all too credible. Haywood hasn't blinked, and his serviceable 
prose style tells it like it is in areas not all writers could or would invade. 
</P>
<P>
Sharyn McCrumb is a writer of generally comic mysteries, and very good, too. In 
The Windsor Knot (Ballantine: $16.95; 283 pp.) there is hardly more than a 
footnote of a mystery, only a good deal of suspense and amusing detail over her 
series character's forthcoming nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth MacPherson, a forensics student and amateur detective, is rushing to 
marry her Scots fiance because he has an invite to the Queen's garden party in 
Edinburgh, and Elizabeth, madly Royalist though a loyal Southern American, is 
eager to attend, which as a wife she can. Thus the knotting, in a Windsor 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
When Elizabeth gets home to Georgia to prepare for the wedding, there's a 
mystery after all: a local woman whose husband apparently has died twice, 
several years apart. The moral is that you can never be sure about ashes. But 
the peripheral hardly detracts from the author's lightly, brightly satirical 
view of the wedding. McCrumb writes with a sharp-pointed pen. Of one character 
she says, "Charles' idea of foreplay was the Mensa test." 
</P>
<P>
Georges Simenon died in 1989 and had stopped writing novels several years 
before that, but he was so prolific that new English translations of his work 
continue to appear. Actually, Madame Maigret's Own Case (Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich: $17.95; 146 pp.) was first published in Paris in 1950 as "Madame 
Maigret's Friend," and published here in different form in 1959. It has not 
been available since, and it is Cmdr. Jules Maigret at his quietly persistent 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Maigret, killing time on a park bench before visiting her dentist, 
agrees to watch a small boy while his nursemaid runs off on an errand. She's 
gone nearly two hours, returns, seizes the boy and dashes off in a taxi with 
never a thank-you. How can this event possibly relate to an anonymous letter 
reporting that a quiet bookbinder has burned a body in his furnace? How indeed. 
</P>
<P>
More a police procedural than many Maigrets, with everything but an All Points 
Bulletin, the solution still derives from the detective's intuitions about 
character and relationships. It remains true that no one ever has captured a 
milieu, Paris, and a particular detecting mode better than Simenon. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the new breed of female private eyes, created by women, is Linda 
Grant's Catherine Sayer, gumpump of Blind Trust (Scribners: $18.95; 274 pp.). 
Like several of the others, she calls California home, San Francisco 
specifically, and the money is not rolling in, which is also a trend. Then a 
banker hires her to locate a missing computer whiz who knows how to break 
through the bank's computer codes and probably is going to heist $5 million in 
trust funds when the codes are vulnerable in a few weeks' time. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wants to stop her, of course; the trail leads all over the West and 
there is a link to Vietnam. The plot is intricate and if the denouement is not 
exactly an amazement, the book is a comfortable adventure, although Sayer is 
not yet as well-defined as, say, Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone. 
</P>
<P>
In the quest for ever-more-offbeat crime-solvers, Rick Boyer has given us Doc 
Adams, an oral surgeon who operates, as you might say, in Massachusetts. In 
Gone to Earth (Fawcett: $16.95; 295 pp.), Doc and his wife have bought a 
long-abandoned farm in the Berkshires. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the premises reveals four pristine Harley-Davidsons, one partly 
buried, in a barn. Not far off are four buried bodies, all young people 
previously reported missing. Dentistry comes in handy; one of the males is not 
who he's reported to be. Missing is a dimwitted young giant abused by family 
and institutions and clever enough to be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer conceives a very tense pursuit: a trap eluded, Doc's career almost 
capped, some sly misdirection by the author. In the end, the monster is as much 
to be pitied as feared, as monsters often are, and the real villainy lies 
elsewhere. This is the sixth in a series, and by now there is probably more of 
the home life of the Adamses than there might be, but it is here the incidental 
underscoring to a strong central motif.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: JOURNEY TO A WAR BY W. H. AUDEN &amp; CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
Commissioned by their publishers to write a travel book, Christopher Isherwood 
and W. H. Auden traveled to China in 1938 to observe the Sino-Japanese War. The 
writers make only brief mentions of their interviews with Generalissimo and 
Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Chou En-Lai, unaware of the crucial roles their 
subjects would play in the postwar world. 
</P>
<P>
But the errors and evils of 19th-Century European policy toward China are 
summarized in Isherwood's devastating account of the artificial splendor of the 
foreign enclave in Shanghai, separated by an unbridgeable social gap from the 
harsh realities of the occupied city. Auden uses the occupation of Shanghai as 
a metaphor for the savagery of all warfare in a sonnet cycle and commentary in 
verse that damns the Japanese as invaders "Who even to themselves deny a human 
freedom,/ And dwell in the estranging tyrant's vision of the earth/ In a calm 
stupor under their blood spotted flag."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BEST COMICS OF THE DECADE SELECTED BY THE EDITORS OF

<TEXT>
<P>
The first installment in a projected two-volume set, "Comics of the Decade" 
examines the graphic work being done outside the mainstream newspaper strips 
and comic books, stressing original approaches to storytelling and imaginative 
visual styles. Bill Griffith ("Zippy the Pinhead") offers a slyly satirical 
self-portrait of an artist torn between the conflicting claims of aesthetic 
purity and commercial gain. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Groening and Jules Feiffer provide delightfully acerbic commentaries on 
the follies of contemporary American politics and culture. However, not all the 
work in this anthology attains that level of excellence: Howard Cruse's rather 
heavy-handed portrait of a repressed clergyman lacks the insouciant charm of 
his "Wendel" series; John Callahan's cartoons about alcoholism seem merely 
crude. "Best Comics" proves that the comics needn't be restricted to the 
homogenized humor of "Garfield" and "Hagar the Horrible".

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CLASSIC PLASTIC RADIOS OF THE 1930S AND 1940S BY JOHN

A celebration of radios made of Catalin, a plastic similar to Bakelite that 
produces deeper, more attractive colors. 
</P>
<P>
As is so often the case with Art Deco chatchkis, these radios have strong 
architectonic elements. The consummately elegant 1933 "Air King" looks like a 
miniature celadon skyscraper. The designs for the pleasingly streamlined 1940 
Fada "Bullet" and 1940 Addison also incorporate architectural elements, with 
similarly graceful results. Unfortunately, John Sideli allows his enthusiasm 
for his subject to carry him away: He describes every radio as wonderful, 
charming, handsome, etc. when some of them are not. Required reading for 
connoisseurs of camp Americana.

SITTING OUT 'DANCE'

<TEXT>
<P>
What a disappointment! When I read Kirk Douglas' autobiography, "Ragman's Son," 
I was enormously impressed with this fine actor's ability as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
I looked forward to reading his recent book and first novel, "Dance With the 
Devil" (July 22). I should have saved my time and money.

OUTTAKES: SECOND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's taken nearly 14 years for William Friedkin's "Sorcerer" (1977) to make it 
to video stores -- it's due Oct. 4 -- and it gave the director time to 
"rethink" the film in terms of color and sound, thanks to changes in 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
What happened when he took it back to the editing room? 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by the movie," he tells us. "I thought I had made an adventure 
film, and instead I had made a grueling and intense two hours." 
</P>
<P>
In the transfer to video, Friedkin says he was able to adjust and enhance the 
film, shot by shot. "The color scheme," he notes, "is psychologically important 
to the story." It's based, you'll recall, on "The Wages of Fear," Henri-Georges 
Clouzot's mid-'50s suspense drama about four fugitives who try to buy their way 
to freedom by transporting a load of fragile explosives over hazardous terrain. 
(Friedkin also remixed the movie's electronic score, by Tangerine Dream, from 
monaural to stereo.) 
</P>
<P>
"Sorcerer" opened to some favorable reviews but died at the box office when 
"Star Wars" opened a week later. Video rights to "Sorcerer" then got tangled up 
in litigation between co-producers MCA/Universal and Paramount Pictures. MCA 
eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin admits that the delay -- and the chance to work again on the picture 
-- has been a boon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy about it," says the Oscar-winning director of "The French 
Connection" and "The Exorcist." "It's my favorite film of the ones I've 
done."SI David J. Fox

OUTTAKES: MORE COS TO COME 
</P>

<TEXT>

Although this summer's "Ghost Dad" failed to boost Bill Cosby's big-screen 
career -- particularly after the notorious failure of his previous film, 
"Leonard Part 6" (1987) -- he's actively developing several scripts at 
Universal, which is ready and willing to back another Cosby feature. 
</P>
<P>
That's according to Stanley Robertson, Cosby's producing partner -- and 
confirmed by the studio, which considers Cosby "a member of the Universal 
family," according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson praises the studio for its marketing of "Ghost Dad," and blames 
critics for its disappointing gross: $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that we made a picture that deserved much better treatment," 
Robertson says, pointing to strong approval ratings from audience surveys. "We 
got bashed unfairly by the critics. Some of the reviews were mean-spirited." 
</P>
<P>
Both comedies and dramas are being considered for Cosby's next outing, 
Robertson says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it ("Ghost Dad") was a perfect picture," he adds. "It didn't 
live up to everyone's expectations. Next time, we're going to do a better 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're not ashamed of it."

NOTEBOOK: ALL THE BICE NEWS THAT'S FIT TO PRINT: CLARK COMES WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Roberto Ruggiero, president of Da Bice U.S.A., announced recently that he 
had hired noted New York-based chef Patrick Clark (most recently of the 
just-closed Metro) and former Tavern on the Green general manager Bruce Axler 
to launch a series of casual new eateries dubbed Cafe Med, he simultaneously 
informed us that he had a "surprise" planned for the Beverly Hills Bice this 
fall. Paul Guzzardo, director of operations for the company, has now revealed 
just what that surprise is -- and part of it is that Clark won't have anything 
to do with the Cafe Med chain after all. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, Clark will be coming to Bice in Beverly Hills as chef, 
starting in early October. The restaurant's original chef, Pino Pasqualato 
(formerly of our own Valentino and La Bruschetta), will continue in the 
kitchen, working side by side with Clark. "Patrick's forte is really fish and 
meat," says Guzzardo, "so he'll concentrate on those areas, while Pino 
concentrates on pastas and other specifically Italian items. We also hope 
they'll engage in a little bit of competition that will spark new ideas for the 
menu." 
</P>
<P>
That menu, Guzzardo continues, will evolve under Clark's direction. "We'll keep 
the same basic dishes, but add a little American-Continental accent to our 
cuisine," he says. "Roberto (Ruggiero) has taken the advice of many who have 
said, 'Basta with the pasta!' I don't mean that we'll be deviating from our 
main line, but it will be fuller than it's been." 
</P>
<P>
He adds that Clark is expected to stay at the Beverly Hills Bice for at least a 
year. Later, he might transfer to another location, in keeping with a 
longstanding Bice practice of exchanging chefs between restaurants. As for the 
Cafe Meds, says Guzzardo, "Patrick will consult on them, but basically our 
feeling is that he's so good, we want to use him at Bice, rather than asking 
him to downplay his creativity for a more informal place." 
</P>
<P>
In other Bice news, Guzzardo has announced that the old Bice Pomodoro site on 
La Cienega, shuttered for some months, has just reopened under new management 
-- but with Da Bice U.S.A. continuing as owners of the property. The new 
management group is headed by Alain Hasson, who was maitre d' at Mr. Chow in 
Beverly Hills, and the restaurant has been rechristened Le Bilboquet -- no 
relation to the trendy little bistro of the same name in New York. "The cuisine 
is mainly Mediterranean, from Nice," says Guzzardo. "We're just letting Alain 
go with his concept and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
THE BIG STINK: The annual L.A. Garlic Festival, usually held each July on a 
closed-off portion of San Vicente Boulevard in West Hollywood, did not perfume 
the air this year. The event, which was organized by Bruce and Katherine 
Veneiro of Nucleus Nuance and benefited the local American Red Cross 
(garlic/vampires/blood -- get it?), was reportedly squelched this year by West 
Hollywood officials on the grounds that it was frivolous, and might help give 
the community a reputation as a "party town." 
</P>
<P>
Garlic-lovers should not despair, though, because at least one longtime regular 
participant in the event, Ken Frank of La Toque on the Sunset Strip, plans a 
mini-garlic festival of his own at his restaurant, from the 10th to the 15th of 
this month. "Somehow," Frank says, "when people go out for a garlic menu, 
they're always in a good frame of mind." The observance -- which Frank has 
dubbed "La Cure d'Ail" (The Garlic Cure) -- will include a different 
four-course menu every night, priced at $36 a head (of people, not of garlic). 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be regular garlic and elephant garlic, raw garlic and cooked garlic," 
says Frank. "We'll make pastas and salads and soups -- a good Provencal fish 
soup with truly garlicky rouille, for instance -- and offer diners a choice of 
meat or fish as a main course every night." Desserts, Frank adds, will not be 
garlic flavored. "We've been there, we've seen, we've learned, and we will not 
be returning," he says of such confections. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, incidentally, Frank has dropped his plans, announced two 
years ago, to convert La Toque into a larger, more informal California-style 
restaurant. "I think at this point," he says, "I'm just going to be satisfied 
-- to keep doing a good job, keep doing what we've been doing for the last 11 
years." 
</P>
<P>
NEW FERRY SCHEDULE: Gerard and Virginie Ferry, owners of L'Orangerie on La 
Cienega and Pastel in the Rodeo Collection in Beverly Hills, plan to close the 
latter restaurant at the end of this month. "It's the end of our lease," says 
Gerard, "and I think I'd rather concentrate on L'Orangerie instead. We've 
always done very well at lunch here, but the whole Rodeo Collection is dead at 
night -- we're the only ones here -- and we do very badly at dinner time. A 
restaurant can't survive on lunch alone, especially today." At the same time, 
the Ferrys have hired a new chef at L'Orangerie -- 31-year-old Jean-Claude 
Parachini, a veteran of the kitchens at two prominent Paris restaurants, 
Vivarois and L'Ambroisie, and himself recently the head chef at La Grenouille 
in New York. The former chef at L'Orangerie, Jean-Francois Meiteignier, is 
investigating the possibility of opening a restaurant of his own, says Gerard. 
</P>
<P>
OUT AND ABOUT: Lawry's California Center in Los Angeles celebrates Mexican 
Independence Day -- the real Mexican Independence Day, not Cinco de Mayo -- 
with a four-day program of special events and buffet meals, from the 13th 
through the 16th (the last date is Independence Day). The vast majority of the 
planned activities are free. Information: (213) 224-6842. . . . Annie and David 
Gingrass, former chefs at Spago and now chefs at Wolfgang Puck's Postrio in San 
Francisco, come to Los Angeles this Friday to teach a cooking class at the 
Epicurean Cooking School in West Hollywood, beginning at 10:30 a.m. The cost is 
$60 per person. The school also starts its new Professional Chef Training 
Series, taught by graduates of the Culinary Institute of America, this month. 
Tuition is $1,150, all-inclusive. Information: (213) 659-5990. . . . More than 
20 Brentwood area restaurants -- including Berty's, the Brentwood Bar &amp; 
Grill, Camelion's, the Daily Grill, Spangles, Sushi Boy, and Toscana -- will 
offer tasting samples at Great Tastes of Brentwood next Sunday, Sept. 16, on 
San Vicente Boulevard between Bringham and Darlington avenues in Brentwood. (In 
offering to close a portion of its stretch of San Vicente Boulevard for this 
event, Brentwood apparently doesn't mind if it gets a reputation as a party 
town.) Tickets are $25 in advance -- call (213) 820-6888 to order them -- or 
$30 at the event itself. Proceeds benefit the California Special Olympics, the 
Brentwood Library, and SOS Coral Trees. . . . And Monday evenings in September 
are "Wash Night" at Patout's in West Los Angeles, featuring all-you-can-eat 
servings of red beans and rice with smoked sausage -- said to be traditional 
Cajun wash-day fare -- for $12 per person.

THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE WORDS HISPANIC AND LATINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calendar's recent articles on La Raza prompt me to try to clarify why the 
distinction between the word Hispanic and the word Latino is important. 
</P>
<P>
The people who are currently in power in this country are mostly of 
northwestern European ancestry. After the Renaissance, the English were locked 
in a struggle with Spain and Portugal over the dominion of the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniards were the frame of reference for the English who came to the New 
World, and, deluded by the language there, Anglos called the natives Hispanics, 
even if they were Spanish-speaking Indians, with whom the criollos intermarried 
soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
This had the convenient effect of negating the existence of the indigenous 
people, who numbered and continued to number in the millions (there are today 1 
million Nahuatl speakers in Mexico alone, according to Encyclopaedia 
Britannica). 
</P>
<P>
This ties in neatly with the (false) rationale that there were almost no 
Indians in the New World, that the land was empty and for the taking. It 
ignores the obvious achievements of the Indians, making them invisible -- 
unpersons. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the fact remains that the genetic pool of the non-Anglos on the North 
American continent is overwhelmingly Indian. The famous dark skin, which Anglos 
are almost at pains to point out, did not come from the Moor. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniards were feared and hated by native peoples, and revolutions were fought 
to throw off the yoke of exploitation over most of the continent. To call 
someone (who is not a Spaniard) Hispanic is simply an insult. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Latino correct? First of all, because that is what we call ourselves. It 
is not a word given to us by people who are historically hostile to us. 
</P>
<P>
It acknowledges the use of French, Portuguese and Spanish, all widely spoken in 
the hemisphere, and it affirms our American-ness -- that is, our Indian-ness. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinoamericano is a word to be used with pride. Latinos have fought 
injustice, repelled foreign invasions, and have, for the most part, replaced 
feudalism with liberal republics. We have won Nobel prizes and made outstanding 
contributions in art, science and medicine, as well as contributed to the 
wealth of the world with our labors. 
</P>
<P>
If we are called Hispanics, however, all this is negated. We are no more 
Spaniards than Bush is British. 
</P>
<P>
How would U.S. Americans feel if all their achievements were considered to be 
European, and not native? 
</P>
<P>
I salute The Times for using the word Latino.

DRUG USE IN CHEECH MARIN'S EARLIER FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope Cheech Marin's new film, "The Shrimp on the Barbie," becomes the 
box-office flop of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Cheech, and his partner in crime, Thomas Chong, made a fortune by glamorizing 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Marin is as guilty as the Colombian drug lords for propelling untold thousands 
of young Americans into the horror of drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Cheech and Chong movies were nothing but propaganda and free 
advertising for drug deals, persuading the naive that the lies they had been 
told about that "Weed From Hell -- Marijuana" were the same lies being told 
about other "harmless drugs" such as uppers, downers, cocaine and LSD. 
</P>
<P>
With acid rock and slapstick humor, these two movie doper heroes put on a 
convincing act of Better Partying Through Chemistry with a "Far out, man!" 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Cheech and Chong's irresponsible portrayal of having fun by 
getting high, I wonder, how many people began a descent into hell while using 
"harmless drugs"? I did, and it's taken me over 13 years to crawl back.

We send a round of applause to Champlin for his balanced and critically 
accurate article on Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry's fans get a little tired of the constant Jerry-bashing, an activity that 
seems to have become a trendy cottage industry practiced by several uninformed 
journalists and critics. It was, therefore, refreshing to read about his 
accomplishments for a change. 
</P>

In Kari Granville's article "A Couple of Cops, With a Twist" (Sept. 2), 
producer Rob Cohen and director John Badham found this wonderful screenplay, 
"The Hard Way." And actor Michael J. Fox loved the unique story and actor James 
Woods thought the idea was fabulous, and throughout the article we learned all 
about Rob's and John's and Michael's and James' feelings and thoughts about 
this fantastic screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Only one thing was left out of the article: Never once did anyone mention the 
name of the person who wrote this wonderful, fabulous, unique screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder what would happen if, suddenly, by some magic, the words on the script 
disappeared and Rob and John and Michael and James were left holding 120 blank 
pages. Would they be able to make their wonderful movie or would they be just 
sitting there quietly, with their fingers up their you-know-what?

IF GROCERY SHOPPING gets any easier, it might even become fun again. Bristol 
Farms, Pasadena's gourmet market, has opened a cook store and a cooking school 
next door -- and they house everything a kitchen whiz needs. 
</P>
<P>
It makes for a natural progression from Bristol Farms, says executive chef 
Claudia McQuillan. Cooks "can shop for groceries and wine in the market; at the 
cooking school, they can learn how to prepare their purchases; then they can 
buy the proper equipment to cook them in." 
</P>
<P>
The cooking school, run by McQuillan, is state-of-the-art, employing such 
equipment as a video monitor system (rather than the standard mirror system 
generally associated with cooking instruction) for helpful close-up viewing,

"I'M A FOODAHOLIC from start to finish," admits jewelry designer Hilary 
Packard. "I love old utensils and have been treasuring and collecting them all 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
Things like an old pie server and an old spatula have found their way into my 
jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
Food is her current subject, again with a stylized contemporary approach: 
spaghetti-and-meatball earrings, in different sizes and configurations, with a 
lacy, abstract serving of pasta with (or without) meatballs; the ratatouille 
pin (a green onion with an eggplant, green pepper and tomato slice); the snack 
necklace, featuring a pretzel, a corn chip, popcorn and a cracker; and the 
milk-and-cookie earrings (a glass of milk dangling from a butter cookie). 
</P>
<P>
Packard's whimsical designs are made of stainless steel, brass and copper, 
sandblasted to achieve the matte surfaces that give the pieces their 
sophisticated appearance and soft colors. An antique patina is imparted to the 
brass and copper elements through a chemical process. 
</P>
<P>
Packard finds her jewelry particularly well suited for the California sense of 
style. "Californians really get what I'm trying to say quickly," she says. 
"They're willing to express themselves and willing to wear something, rather 
than just admire it in a case." And that includes spaghetti and meatballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilary Packard's food jewelry is available at the MOCA Store, 250 S. Grand 
Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 621-1710; and Lawry's Gift Shop, at Lawry's California 
Center, 570 West Avenue 26, Los Angeles, (213) 224-6800.

ETHNIC TURKS TOSSED OUT OF BULGARIA BY FORMER REGIME ARE WARY OF RETURNING 
</P>

ISTANBUL, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sennur Kurkmaz is a 21-year-old ethnic Turk who was separated from her soldier 
husband of three months and deported from her Bulgarian homeland along with the 
rest of her family last summer. She now lives with an aunt, works a 66-hour 
week in an Istanbul bar for about $200 a month, and is helping her adolescent 
brother to get to college. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her problems, Kurkmaz will not be tempted by offers from the new 
post-Communist Bulgarian government to return home. She hopes her husband will 
join her when his 2-year military conscription ends, but she has little faith 
in Bulgarian officials and wonders how long he will have to wait for his 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
Kurkmaz was among an estimated 10,000 ethnic Turks thrown out of Bulgaria by 
the former hard-line Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, in May and June last 
year. Their "crime" was to have opposed their enforced ethnic assimilation, 
which included bans on speaking Turkish, and practicing the Muslim religion, 
and the humiliation of having their names changed to Slavonic ones. 
</P>
<P>
By Aug. 22, when the Turkish government closed its frontier with Bulgaria, 
another 320,000 ethnic Turks had voluntarily followed the Kurkmaz family in 
what became the greatest European population movement since World War II. About 
130,000 subsequently returned, but exactly a year later Turkish Foreign 
Ministry sources estimate that over 1,000 a week have continued to receive 
emigration visas and settle in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"We were made strangers in our own country because we had a Turkish ethnic 
consciousness," Sennur Kurkmaz explained. "My life is difficult here, but I am 
accepted in Turkey and can live more freely." 
</P>
<P>
Kurkmaz's views were echoed by many of her compatriots attending a gathering of 
Istanbul's Balkan Turkish Cultural and Solidarity Organization. The president, 
Mehmed Cavus, explained that the organization was helping to overcome problems 
of integration for the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are helping with housing applications, job retraining, uniting divided 
families, and resolving outstanding problems left behind in Bulgaria," Cavus 
said. "All retired people who came have lost their pensions and most people 
have lost their property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has helped nearly 1,000 immigrant high school children go on 
to universities. Others are benefiting from a second $10-million U.S. Agency 
for International Development grant for vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 22 young people in a 4-month, full-time computer-studies course," a 
committee member, Hanife Mutlu, said. "Our youngsters would not have had such 
chances in Bulgaria." 
</P>
<P>
Family tragedies are not scarce at the meeting. Habil Takavidov pleaded for 
information about the death last September of his 21-year-old army-conscript 
son, Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Takavidov, a former political prisoner, said that last year boys due for 
military service were refused exit visas by the Bulgarian authorities and they 
effectively became hostages. "I am too frightened to return at the moment and I 
only know from a relative's letter that he died in hospital. I have no official 
information." 
</P>
<P>
There are few regrets among those who have settled in Turkey, although many 
speak warmly of their immediate Bulgarian friends. Hanife Yilmaz told how her 
Bulgarian neighbors had stored her furniture and other belongings when 
officials emptied her flat into the street after she fled last July. 
</P>
<P>
"The authorities have now taken the flat back even though we paid our mortgage 
for 20 years and we have been offered no compensation," she said. "My husband 
was shot during a human rights demonstration last May; he still cannot work and 
we will not risk going back in case he is arrested."

MEXICO CITY, LARGELY REBUILT SINCE '85 QUAKE, COPES DESPITE OFFICIALDOM; 
</P>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The catastrophic earthquake that devastated Mexico City five years ago lasted 
only a minute or so, but it set in motion political and social tremors still 
felt today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides leveling buildings and homes, killing thousands (some estimates say 
30,000) and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, the quake seriously damaged 
the image of invincibility of the governing political party, radicalized many 
citizens and demonstrated to many others, if only briefly, the viability of 
"people power." 
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) still governs the city of 15 
million, but less certainly than before. Most of the volunteers who poured into 
the streets returned home changed, more confident of their power and 
distrustful of the government. Some of the volunteers stayed on as political 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
In the moments after the thunder of buildings falling to the ground subsided, 
citizens took charge. 
</P>
<P>
They rushed into the battered streets to rescue the trapped and unearth the 
dead. They set up shelters for the homeless and started rebuilding. And they 
did all this without help from a paternalistic government that had always done 
everything; did it without the omnipresent PRI. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that five years later it is still trembling in Mexico City," said 
Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a political analyst, newspaper columnist and researcher 
at the National University's Center for U.S. Studies. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed Mexico City for just a second in the historical framework of time 
what it would be like to be in a city where the government becomes subordinate 
and accountable and the people emerge, and the people rule and the government 
obeys." 
</P>
<P>
The quake hit at 7:19 a.m. on Sept. 19, while most people were at home or en 
route to work. Registering magnitude 8.1, it was classified a "great" quake. 
Another the next day measured 7.5, but most of the damage was already done. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where the government had been the main provider of assistance for 
decades, citizens of all stripes -- students, neighbors, private engineers, 
tough street gangs -- went into the streets by the thousands to help. One 
government estimate said there were 1 million volunteers, unusual in a country 
with no tradition of grass-roots volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
They organized themselves into brigades to dig their way to survivors, pull out 
bodies, bring food and water to the homeless and the rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were trying to save people's lives and the government was trying to 
regain control," said Adrian de Lope, then a student at the private Anahuac 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Now 25, De Lope was one of those who stayed in volunteer work. He spent four 
years after his graduation working with the school's housing and community 
development project for earthquake victims. He is still a fund-raiser for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have the power, or at least they know that they can have it," he 
said. "They now know that they are able to do things that they didn't know they 
were able to do before." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico, said many city dwellers 
were already fed up with the authoritarian political system. 
</P>
<P>
"But that particular (governmental) tardiness, the slowness of the response, 
made them more willing to criticize openly the behavior of the bureaucracy and 
the lack of leadership of (President Miguel) de la Madrid." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, government officials say no city hit by such a large 
disaster has been able to rebuild so fast. They point to the reconstruction, 
replacement, repair or financing of 105,000 housing units in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the damage, the tragedy, was so great that we even had to 
take a while to be able to perceive and know the extent of the disaster," said 
Enrique Jackson, president of the PRI in Mexico City. "Certainly if it hadn't 
been for society we wouldn't have been able to begin to attend to and help the 
affected people. The people had a big role." 
</P>
<P>
The PRI began to recoup, organizing residents into reconstruction committees at 
the new housing units. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the rubble, questions arose. Citizens asked how the buildings that fell 
had been built. They wondered why hospitals, government offices, the 14-story 
Nuevo Leon building collapsed, killing hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
After a week, the government stopped counting bodies, as if to try to diminish 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The government was directly in charge of some of those constructions, somebody 
you can pinpoint as the guilty one," Meyer said. "You can end with another 
classic case of corruption, so you diminish the importance of the damage and 
hope that society will not demand an inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
No one went to jail in connection with any of the collapses. 
</P>
<P>
But in the July, 1988, general election, De la Madrid's successor, Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, lost in the capital to leftist parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The rejection of the PRI in the '88 election is very connected with the 
earthquake, with the incapacity of the government to resolve the problems and 
also with the many neighborhood organizations that emerged," said Heberto 
Castillo, a Democratic Revolutionary Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI's Jackson said economic crisis and increasing masses of poor, not the 
quake, hurt his party. The party won in the voting districts hardest hit by the 
quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI won the congressional and Mexico City assembly races, but in those same 
districts, the left defeated Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
The city today looks much the same as it did. Many of the shiny glass-walled 
high-rises are reconstructed earthquake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the weathered steel skeleton of an Agriculture Department building 
juts out on Reforma Boulevard, one of numerous structures yet to be rebuilt or 
torn down. There are parks or vacant lots where buildings once stood. Small 
camps house some of the thousands who remain homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Brightly colored vecindades -- small row houses around an inner patio -- stand 
out in low-income neighborhoods where old shacks, given a final blow in the 
quake, were torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Some government offices moved out of downtown or to the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
A construction code passed after the quake stiffened requirements for tall 
buildings. But there is lingering worry about another major quake. 
Seismologists are keeping an eye on a fault in a different location off the 
Pacific Coast. Movement there, they say, could shake the lake bed where Mexico 
City sits as strongly as the last quake. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a tremor now, it's not the same as before. Now we know that 
buildings fall and people die. Now people react with more fear of earthquakes," 
said Carmen Blanco, a National University psychology professor. She worked in 
the school's post-earthquake psychology service. 
</P>
<P>
If the city has been largely rebuilt, its people will never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelina Corona, 52, who worked as seamstress on San Antonio Abad Street, 
dared not confront her employer before the quake. Now she is an outspoken union 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Before the quake, she sewed so fast her machine smoked. She thought it good of 
her employer to give a country woman with a third-grade education a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Then the buildings crammed with sewing factories gave way, trapping hundreds of 
seamstresses. Her boss said the jobs were gone, there would be little 
severance. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-October, seamstresses from the different factories had organized into a 
non-government union. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Paz quit his job as a government social worker because of the way the 
government was handling recovery efforts. He helped organize his damaged 
neighborhood first to survive, then rebuild, without government help. 
</P>
<P>
Paz works with an organization called Campamentos Unidos (Camps United), a 
self-help housing association rebuilding neighborhoods with no government 
assistance. With help from Operation USA and other international groups, it 
also has built a neighborhood clinic and is planning to build a Center for 
Studies of the Neighborhood to provide research, advice and training for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the quake victims are also rebuilding their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by handicapped Vietnam Veterans in Miami where he was fitted for 
prosthesis, Celso Garcia has remarried and he and his wife are expecting a 
baby. His first wife, one of his two daughters, a sister and a cousin died in 
the quake when their fourth-floor apartment collapsed. Both his legs were 
crushed and later amputated. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jose Juan Hernandez Cruz, trapped four days between the concrete slabs of 
the government's Juarez Hospital, has not married but has adopted a daughter, 
now 2. He works at a Health Department clinic until midafternoon and at a 
prison in the evenings. He is looking forward to visiting the French team that 
rescued him. 
</P>
<P>
The 19 babies who were discovered one by one in the wreckage of hospitals, the 
last one nearly nine days after the quake, are now in kindergarten. One has met 
the American firemen who rescued her. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 19 is Evelia Alvarez Gasca, whose mother died in the quake. She is 
being cared for by a 31-year-old aunt who has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Reyes Gonzalez is a street vendor, selling fried pork skins and other 
tidbits. Since the earthquake he has been doing volunteer work at a 
neighborhood housing association. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Gonzalez's old slum neighborhood was the site of one of Campamentos 
Unidos' first projects. Before the quake it was a collection of one-room wood 
and cardboard shacks with two bathrooms for 600 people, too flimsy to be 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Government and private projects put up condominiums, replacing communal toilets 
and laundry sinks with facilities for each apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply with the bathrooms, socially there has been a 90-degree turn," Reyes 
said. "We aren't yet high society, but we're living like human beings." 
</P>
<P>
He said he still works as a volunteer for the satisfaction of seeing others 
"have a home worthy of a Mexican."

ELDERHOSTEL OFFERS LEARNING, LORE, LEISURE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Big Easy" credits rolled, the lights came up and the class was full of 
questions. Was the movie based on fact? Was Jim Garrison really responsible for 
cleaning up Louisiana? How do you pronounce that strange name, Tchoupitoulas? 
Is Cajun music taught? 
</P>
<P>
As in most classes, a few people asked most of the questions and the class 
clown made a crack or two. But there was a difference between this class and 
others at the University of Southwestern Louisiana: no college kids. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 students had come from around the country to Lafayette for a weeklong 
"Elderhostel," part of a national program for people 60 or older. 
</P>
<P>
"We must continue our education," 66-year-old Douglas Rowley said, and winked. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Lila, said they spent the past two winters in Texas. They came 
through south Louisiana on their way home last winter and wanted to see more of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
They looked in Elderhostel Inc.'s fat tabloid catalogue -- Elderhostels are 
given in every state and Canadian province and numerous countries overseas -- 
and found the right combination of time, place and subject in Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
"We've known about them for three or four years, but this was the first time we 
were finally motivated enough to try one," said Mrs. Rowley. 
</P>
<P>
The classes were an odd gumbo of topics: Cajuns and Creoles in Louisiana films, 
Louisiana architecture, Mississippi River customs and geology, and the Cajun 
waltz and two-step. 
</P>
<P>
That's often the case in Elderhostels. 
</P>
<P>
You can go, for example, to Connecticut College in New London and study 
psychological portraits of American presidents, Dante's "Inferno" and country 
dances of old England. 
</P>
<P>
Elderhostels try to schedule a variety of topics, preferably divided among 
science and arts and humanities, said Cynthia Trahan, administrative director 
for USL's program. 
</P>
<P>
There are some exceptions. The Elderhostel timed to coincide with the Festivals 
Acadiens focuses on Cajun food, Cajun music and dancing, and Louisiana arts and 
crafts. The Mardi Gras Elderhostel describes the history of Carnival and its 
various traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition at Louisiana Elderhostels ranges from $210 to $265. The classes bring 
instructors and the schools a little money, but not riches, Trahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Elderhostels put their students up in dormitories, but USL uses part of 
the tuition to pay for rooms in a motel, shuttling students back and forth in 
vans. 
</P>
<P>
John and Corabeth -- or Jack and Bess -- Fuller of Houston liked that. "I 
always look for two or less to a room and a private bath," said Mrs. Fuller, 
72. "I look at the subject carefully, but if you stay in cabins with six people 
to a room ..." She shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, 69, said he was particularly interested in the daylong tour of the 
Mississippi River and in the descriptions of Cajun life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
They learned that Cajuns are the descendants of French Canadians whom the 
British kicked out of what was called Acadia in 1755. 
</P>
<P>
They also learned that the movie "Belizaire the Cajun" is, as teacher Mathe 
Allain put it, a fairy tale; that inaccuracies in "Blaze" include having 
someone as handsome as Paul Newman play Gov. Earl K. Long; and that a pair of 
dams in central Louisiana is all that keeps the Mississippi River from changing 
course and leaving New Orleans on a mud flat. 
</P>
<P>
As for "The Big Easy," Allain told the class its plot wasn't based on any 
particular case; Garrison was a district attorney rather than the judge he 
played in the movie and was known best for his investigation of John F. 
Kennedy's assassination; and that there aren't a lot of formal lessons in Cajun 
music. 
</P>
<P>
One detail tripped her up. She spelled Tchoupitoulas Street correctly, but 
pronounced it "ChoopiTOOla" rather than the "ChoppuhTOOlis" heard in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"It does throw outsiders," she said.

EMU KEY TO MILLION-DOLLAR EXPORT VISION

"Emus are the dumbest animals put on this planet, but never stand in front of 
them or they'll rip you open," said Steven Hawker, sporting the scars to prove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Hawker, who manages the Kalaya Emu Farm nine miles out of remote Cue in the 
middle of Western Australia, said farming the tall, ungainly, native birds is 
normally easy work -- except during mating season. 
</P>
<P>
"They get quite aggressive during mating season and often kill each other," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to pair them you've got to make sure you're standing behind them 
or they'll try to kick you -- and they can open you up from head to toe." 
</P>
<P>
But Hawker is hoping that what the flightless emu may lack in intelligence, it 
will make up for in other ways on the export market. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years Hawker and a group of local Aborigines have been raising 
the 6-foot-6 emus with the intention of selling their meat overseas as a 
delicacy, their leather hides for fashion garments or book binding, and their 
oil for use in cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the first emu steak graces the plate of an upscale restaurant in 
Europe in 1992, $150,000 will have been injected into the farm. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on land above a vast artesian spring system, Kalaya's 1,000 acres are 
a plush green oasis in this arid and dusty land, boasting date trees and grape 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"You can grow anything here provided you have the water, and we have the 
water," said Hawker. 
</P>
<P>
Kalaya's unique natural resources have placed it at the vanguard of the 
embryonic emu farming industry in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"We are involved in a major expansion operation here. We hope to have 2,000 
birds by the end of the year thanks to two incubators we've ordered," Hawker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 17 licensed emu farms across Australia supporting an 
estimated 4,000 birds. 
</P>
<P>
This year about 1,000 emus will be slaughtered purely for market research. The 
industry's first commercial cull will come in 1992, when an estimated 11,000 to 
15,000 birds will be killed for domestic and export consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is at a critical stage," said Noel Fallon, president of the Emu 
Farmers' Assn. of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got great potential but it needs to be carefully managed to avoid 
overproduction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fallon said an initial overproduction and fall in prices is inevitable, but he 
hoped prices, now currently $150 a bird, will not fall much below $98. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it (the industry) gets up on its feet I think it will survive quite well, 
but we must first overcome that trough that besets any sunrise industry," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1997 the industry hopes to be exporting 80,000 birds annually and earning 
just under $12 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy, France and Spain have all expressed interest with the industry, but the 
Asian market remains largely untapped," Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
Fallon said the industry is being modeled on the ostrich industry in South 
Africa, where a farmers co-operative issues quotas to both producers and buyers 
and monitors quality control. 
</P>
<P>
Farming emus is not hard work -- like sheep, the long-legged emus are docile 
creatures and can be easily worked. 
</P>
<P>
Pairs of mature birds are kept in small pens while mating. Once the eggs have 
been laid they are taken to incubators and the mature emus herded into larger 
paddocks containing a few dozen birds. 
</P>
<P>
Emu chicks are nursed in separate pens as the mature birds leave them to their 
own devices once they are old enough to walk and leave the nest. 
</P>
<P>
Fully grown birds, their bulbous bodies weighing between 99 and 110 pounds, 
will yield 33 pounds of meat, 10.7 square feet of leather and 1.3 gallons of 
oil.

FORCES TEST SWEDEN'S HISTORIC NEUTRALITY 
</P>

<P>
Swedish neutrality has survived intact since the time of Napoleon. But how will 
it fare without concrete means of support? 
</P>
<P>
Like the cannons of Kalmar castle on Sweden's east coast, pointing proudly out 
to sea but taken over by rabbit dens, the foundations of its defense policy are 
starting to slip. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweden has continually put off reforming its World War II defense structure. 
Now the issue has become a crisis," researcher Wilhelm Agrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Swedes have always been led to believe their neutrality rests on two pillars -- 
compulsory military service and self-reliance on the most important weapons. 
Now both these items are costing too much for a country of 8.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if we removed the two pillars? Nobody has ever proved that 
neutrality depends on them," said Agrell, assistant professor of history at 
Lund University. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Johan Aberg, chairman of the Parliamentary Defense Committee, said: "We 
are not thinking about dropping our neutrality. But we need to change what it 
means in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials, politicians and researchers agree that an unchanged defense 
budget of $5.1 billion means cutting either arms spending or the length of 
military service from the present 7.5 months, or both. 
</P>
<P>
The military threat to Sweden is perceived not so much as a potential invasion, 
but that a great power might try to march through on its way to attack Norway 
or Finland, as happened during World War II, or set up bases here. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson believes the defense committee's budget 
proposals next year will be a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense industry is in bad shape. Running it down any further could 
jeopardize our preparedness for war. It is easier to train people in arms than 
build up a defense industry from scratch," Gustafsson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden cannot expect any immediate benefits from the upheaval within the Warsaw 
Pact and NATO military alliances. 
</P>
<P>
"While the Soviet military threat on the (European) Continent will be 
drastically curtailed, the threat to Sweden and Finland will not be affected," 
Ingemar Dorfer of the Swedish Defense Research Establishment said in a paper. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said recently: "We are a neutral country relying 
on our own strength. We must see a positive development between the two rival 
military alliances before we draw definite conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's policy is to design and produce its own military aircraft, ships, 
tanks and guns to avoid reliance on outside suppliers in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
The country has four out of the world's 100 largest arms producers and ranks 
ninth largest in arms exports. However the foreign policy goal of mediating in 
foreign conflicts prevents unrestricted sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The development costs per plane, per tank are very high because of the small 
numbers. But non-alliance is becoming less important, and the international 
price of arms is falling. There could be savings there," the daily Dagens 
Nyheter commented. 
</P>
<P>
The first test could come Oct. 1, when the defense procurement agency FMV is 
due to announce the price it has negotiated with a Swedish consortium for the 
second batch of 110 Jas Gripen warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden has already ordered 30 of the lightweight aircraft, which rely on 
computers for stability and can be used for interception, ground attack or 
reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
The project, delayed by the crash of the first Jas Gripen prototype, is running 
about $1.3 billion beyond its initial budget of about $8.45 billion, Dagens 
Nyheter reported. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's second prototype has now completed two short test flights. "I hope 
the project survives. But the darned plane has still to prove it can fly," 
Dorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden must also decide next year whether to proceed with a new battle tank 
designed by the Bofors company. The alternative would be to buy an 
off-the-shelf M1 from General Dynamics Corp. or the Leopard II from West 
Germany's Kraus-Maffei.

U.S. LEGAL EXPERTS AID IN WORLD JUDICIAL REFORM 
</P>

<P>
While democratic changes spread through Eastern Europe, San Francisco lawyer 
Steven Mayo is helping countries to reform their justice systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The world seems to be involved in legal reform; people are demanding a greater 
role in justice systems," Mayo said during a recent visit to Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling from my readings is that governments believe they cannot stay in 
power without giving a little," said Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, Mayo, 31, has organized delegations of American lawyers 
and judges to give demonstrations of U.S.-style trials and to hold seminars in 
22 South American and Asian countries. In the fall, he plans to go to Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best export we have got in the states is our democratic 
institutions, and the basis of those institutions is our justice system," said 
Mayo, whose trips are funded in part by the U.S. State Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite our faults, we have a system that works," Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo recently brought a delegation to Argentina at the invitation of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"In Argentina, we cannot see trials; we cannot participate in trials. The 
witnesses don't even participate. All this adds up to a system that does not 
function," said Argentine Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo. 
</P>
<P>
Six-and-a-half years after the military handed over rule to an elected civilian 
president, the Argentine Congress is considering opening courts to the public. 
</P>
<P>
At present, virtually all legal proceedings in Argentina take place behind 
closed doors and are written rather than oral proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a very strict tie between how a justice system functions 
and how a democracy functions," said Ocampo. 
</P>
<P>
"In Argentina, we have a tradition of not respecting the law, and that carries 
over to a lack of respect for political systems," Ocampo said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo's visiting delegations include men like California Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas and Los Angeles District Judge Matt Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
"If Argentina had a new kind of cataract surgery, we would want them to come to 
the United States and tell us about it. That is why we are here: We feel we 
have something that works, and we want to share it," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big advantage of the oral trial in the United States is that it is a 
transparent process -- the public can see everything that is going on," Lucas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo said he tries to reach the people watching and participating in the 
re-enactments of oral or jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
"This is education through participation," Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Boscoscuro, 25, an Argentine law student watching the mock trial of 
California bank robber John Johnson, said the demonstration showed him how the 
system should work. 
</P>
<P>
"This trial is about something extremely important," he said. "It means 
deciding whether we can participate in justice. It means trying to stop 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Boscoscuro explained that under the current system, cases drag on for years. 
And judges, protected by closed doors, are easily bribed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the money, you go free. If not, you spend years waiting for your 
trial," Boscoscuro said. 
</P>
<P>
But Argentine reform efforts have met with criticism, especially, in this 
economically strapped country, over the cost. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most lawyers in Argentina have never cross-examined a witness or 
made an appeal and must learn oral arguing skills from scratch. Mayo says he 
expects to return to Argentina in a year to give a seminar on how to argue 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics note that the government will be forced to build new courtrooms 
to house public trials, added expenditures that come when funds are so tight 
that justice workers bicker over paper and pencils. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo said judicial reform is gaining ground in countries like the Philippines, 
South Korea, Thailand, China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which Mayo said now has a system of government-appointed judges with a 
near 98% conviction rate, is considering switching to jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Japan are saying, 'We want a little larger slice of the pie," 
said Mayo.

ARGENTINA: VICTIM OF AUTO BURGLARY GIVES CHASE, KILLS TWO THIEVES. HE IS FREED

<P>
Crime has tripled, muggers walk free, anger grows in tandem with fear, and 
Horacio Santos, who chased down and killed two thieves because he couldn't take 
any more, has become the symbol of it all. 
</P>
<P>
The Santos case jarred many of the 10 million people in Buenos Aires, who felt 
safe in their city until the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Historians, sociologists, judges, police, government officials, newspaper 
vendors and nearly everyone else express opinions about the case at cocktail 
parties, in letters to editors, on street corners and radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
One Saturday morning in June, Santos, a 42-year-old engineer, heard glass 
breaking outside his home and recognized the sound of his car alarm. He rushed 
to a window and saw two men, laughing, walk off to their own car with his tape 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
Santos' home had been burglarized twice and thieves had broken into his car 14 
times. Overwhelmed by anger, he gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
When Santos caught up to the thieves on the road, he shot one in the head and 
the other in the throat. Two bullets, two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on homicide charges and confined in a hospital for psychiatric 
tests. His wife, Norma, said: "I can't believe what happened. Horacio can't 
either. This is a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Judge Luis Cevasco ruled that Santos was "non-indictable" 
because he acted while in a state of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
The men Santos killed were not career criminals. One was a 31-year-old bus 
driver and the other, 29, worked in a butcher shop. Both had wives and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
As Argentina's economic recession has shrunk real wages and increased 
unemployment, more people have turned to crime. 
</P>
<P>
Did Horacio Santos do the right thing? 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same, may God forgive me," said Bernardo Neustadt, 
Argentina's most popular news commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Grondona, host of the television program "Key Hour," said: "About 99% 
of the calls to my program were in favor of Santos' reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Luis Passero, chief of the federal police, said Santos "can't be taken as 
an example" for others because "that would be going back to the law of the 
jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Robbery and assault have become commonplace in Buenos Aires. Crimes such as 
rape and murder are relatively rare, but some highly publicized cases of 
violence make people feel vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, two days before the Santos shooting, a businessman who had 
identified a mugger in a police lineup was shot and killed after the alleged 
assailant was released. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, men brandishing a machine gun tried to force investment broker 
Esteban Reynal off the main highway north of the city as he drove to his 
weekend home. He accelerated and outran them. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a judge's home was bombed and gunmen shot up the car of 
another. The second magistrate, Luis Cevasco, blamed "parapolice groups" that 
were trying to influence cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is that it's not just criminals, but also the forces of 
security" who commit crimes, said Reynal, who recognized one of his assailants 
in the police station where he reported the shooting. The provincial policeman 
was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In July, three policemen who offered to free a jailed person in exchange for a 
computer were sentenced to jail. A judge has been accused of trying to extort 
$500,000 from a medical clinic in return for dropping charges the clinic claims 
the judge fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
Corruption is a serious problem among police officers, who are paid the 
equivalent of only $100 a month and usually have second jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of crimes in Buenos Aires province 
was 122,000 last year, compared to 47,000 in 1985. Argentines are increasingly 
careful about what they wear, where they go and how they get there. 
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Santos and his neighbors organized teams to watch homes and cars. 
Private security guards patrol wealthy communities. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the zone of weekend homes and country clubs along Rio de la Plata 
are buying guard dogs, electric gates and handguns, and chipping in to provide 
the police with better cars and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Buenos Aires province has announced plans to transfer more officers to street 
duty and hire 2,000 new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Police acknowledge that crime is increasing but claim it isn't out of control. 
Most of the offenses are muggings and thefts from cars and homes. Street gangs 
and drug peddling, like major violent crimes, are uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Passero said that the conviction rate is low because of reforms in the 
penal code made in 1984, when civilian democracy returned after nearly eight 
years of military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Each 100 arrests result in only 2.6 convictions and half of those get off 
without jail terms, he said.

Pope John Paul II, in Kabgayi, Rwanda, called for a narrowing of the gap 
between Africa's urban elite and rural poor and urged peasants in this 
infertile nation to redouble efforts to improve the quality of their lives. The 
pontiff said Rwandan peasants, who make up more than 80% of the population of 7 
million, have the right to demand the same health, social and administrative 
facilities, including credit banking, as their urban counterparts.

N.Y. SPEEDS DOWN THE ROAD TO TRAFFIC DISASTER

It is 4:01 p.m. at Shadow Traffic Network, and Fred Bennett's headset is 
buzzing with bad news. 
</P>
<P>
A school bus accident has snarled traffic along Flatbush Avenue. A disabled 
tractor-trailer is tying up the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. Another truck accident 
is blocking an entrance to the George Washington Bridge. Five minutes later, 
the Manhattan Bridge is packed after being closed while President Bush's 
motorcade carried him to a GOP fund-raiser at the Waldorf Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, operations manager for a firm that provides live reports to 62 area 
radio and television stations, alternately works the phones and takes two-way 
radio reports from six aircraft and 40 cars, furiously typing each tie-up onto 
a color-coded computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:37, helicopter pilot Bob Glantzberg reports that construction is causing 
bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Van Wyck Expressway. At 4:57, things look bad 
on the New Jersey Turnpike. At 4:59, Glantzberg's voice crackles over the 
headset with word of yet another accident, this one causing a standstill on the 
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Bennett's computer screen is full. 
</P>
<P>
Shadow Traffic's far-flung network provides minute-by-minute confirmation of 
what anyone who drives in and around New York City already knows: The place is 
a commuter's nightmare. With 900,000 smoke-spewing vehicles crawling into 
Manhattan each weekday morning -- 25% more than a decade ago -- traffic 
routinely backs up at the 20 bridges and tunnels connecting the island with the 
rest of the sprawling tri-state area. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, New Yorkers waste 50 million hours a year stuck in traffic. 
Eleven million cars compete for space across the 31-county region, a number 
that is expected to jump to 16 million within 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Things have gone from awful to absurd recently as a spate of construction 
projects has further constricted the aging concrete arteries that bind the 
region. Two lanes on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, Manhattan's main north-south 
highway, were closed in July for a reconstruction project scheduled to last 
three years. Two lanes were shut down in June on the Queensboro Bridge, where 
endless construction has tied up traffic since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Repaving on the Long Island Expressway approach to Manhattan will last until 
1995; work will continue on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway through 1994. From 
cable repairs on the Brooklyn Bridge to nighttime work on the George Washington 
Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the list seems endless. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no off-peak period any more," said former city traffic engineer 
Samuel Schwartz, who writes the "Gridlock Sam" column for the New York Daily 
News. "We've moved into a dimension of round-the-clock rush hours. We're 
condensing 50 years of construction work into 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the jackhammer pace of construction is that the city's highways 
and bridges are falling apart. Local officials plan to spend $3 billion during 
the 1990s, most of it federal and state money, just to keep open the same basic 
system that carried about half as many cars into Manhattan during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"This construction is necessary because we have the oldest infrastructure in 
the country, and it's been subjected to years of neglect," said Joe DePlasco, 
spokesman for the city's Transportation Department. "Many of these facilities 
are in very poor shape. Most of the highways are approaching 50 years old; many 
of the bridges are approaching 100 years old. Some of them haven't been painted 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
The price of bottlenecks -- from Montclair in New Jersey to Montauk on Long 
Island -- is more than just frayed nerves and increased air pollution. "It's 
definitely a drag on the economy: time wasted in traffic, wear and tear on 
roadways, the very high cost for truckers trying to get goods in and out of the 
area," said Mary Rivers of the Regional Plan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The danger level is also increasing. Last year, a 500-pound slab of concrete 
fell from the FDR Drive, killing a Brooklyn dental technician in his car, and 
part of the Manhattan Bridge was closed after two support beams rusted through. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Williamsburg Bridge was closed for a couple of months for safety 
reasons a year after two 30-pound steel bars fell from the bridge into the East 
River. In 1982, part of the West Side Highway collapsed. A year earlier, a 
Japanese photographer died after being struck in the head by a 600-foot cable 
that snapped on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to New York's seaside geography, traffic is constantly snarled at toll 
booths, where drivers pay up to $5 for the privilege of traversing rivers and 
bays. The gridlock even extends to the skies: Flight delays soared 111% at La 
Guardia Airport and 52% at Kennedy Airport last year. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, only 16% of the 3.4 million daily commuters converging on midtown 
Manhattan arrive by car or taxi, compared to 60% by subway and 23% on buses and 
commuter trains. Yet despite years of official hostility to the automobile 
("Don't Even THINK of Parking Here"), a tripling in the number of parking 
tickets and $32-a-day midtown garage fees, still more commuters are hitting the 
highways. Others are fleeing the subway system -- where ridership is down 6% 
because of rising crime and higher fares -- for such alternatives as express 
buses and private car services.

MALPRACTICE CLAIMS CITE DOCTOR'S USE OF FORCEPS TO SPEED DELIVERY 
</P>

<P>
The birth and brief life of Diana Perkins has focused attention on the use of 
forceps in the delivery room, a practice that can save a baby's life -- or end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
New York state officials have found Dr. Ronald Loffredo, an obstetrician here, 
to have been negligent in nine of 12 deliveries, including Diana's, over three 
years. In each case, forceps were used. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo and his attorney are preparing to fight damage claims brought by 
Diana's parents, the only family to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Diana was born May 20, 1986. She died three days later. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo was accused of failing to determine that she was too large for vaginal 
delivery, and thus neglecting to perform a Cesarean section. He also was found 
negligent for not having assessed the baby's position before he used forceps, 
for administering a uterine stimulant "in a potentially obstructed labor," for 
using excessive force in the delivery and causing unnecessary trauma to both 
mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo no longer practices at Saratoga Hospital, and the state Board of 
Regents, which oversees medical practice, in July suspended his license for one 
year. Once the suspension runs out, Loffredo will remain barred from delivering 
babies or performing gynecological surgery until he has completed a retraining 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1988, his admissions privileges at Saratoga Hospital were 
revoked after a 28-year-old woman under his care died just days after giving 
birth to a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo still has support among his longtime patients, some of whom picketed 
the hospital and have raised about $50,000 for his legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been ruinous, absolutely ruinous!" Loffredo said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He defended his actions in the Perkins case and criticized Saratoga Hospital as 
having allowed itself to be goaded by the state Health Department. Loffredo 
said the hospital exonerated him after conducting its own investigation of the 
Perkins case, but state health officials later forced a review of its findings. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the cases was brought about by patient complaints," said Loffredo, who 
is suing the Health Department and Saratoga Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This process is being driven by a bureaucracy," his attorney, Frederick 
Killeen, said. 
</P>
<P>
Use of obstetrical forceps, which date to 18th-Century Europe, has long been 
questioned. The instrument, which resembles hinged salad tongs, is used to 
speed up delivery if the mother's life is in danger or if the umbilical cord is 
wrapped around the fetus's neck. Forceps also are used to rotate the baby if it 
is turned away from the normal birth position. 
</P>
<P>
The shallow steel or aluminum blades fit the contours of the baby's head and 
the birth canal, but even in highly skilled hands forceps can cause permanent 
injury to mother and child, experts acknowledge. Forceps can leave permanent 
indentations on the skull, as well as cuts and bruises on the infant's face, 
ears and scalp. 
</P>
<P>
When actor Sylvester Stallone was born, forceps severed a nerve on the left 
side of his face, causing a slur in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo's use of forceps allegedly left bruises on Diana Perkins' neck and one 
earlobe. Loffredo, a soft-spoken man who built his practice in Saratoga Springs 
after training in forceps at Rochester General Hospital, said the baby suffered 
"minor scrapes" but was not traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1980 survey by the National Center for Health Statistics in 
Baltimore, forceps were used in 17.4%, or 625,000, of 3.6 million live births. 
No accurate records were kept before that, said Ken Keppel, spokesman for the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The use of forceps has declined dramatically in most areas of the country, 
partly because of high medical malpractice premiums, said Dr. Maurice Drusin, 
director of obstetrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been linked to all kinds of problems which have nothing to do with 
forceps at all," said Drusin, who is expert in high-risk deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Loffredo, 40, estimated that he used forceps in 25% to 35% of about 1,500 
births he assisted during his 10 years as an obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
David Stewart, executive director of the National Assn. of Parents and 
Professionals for Safe Alternatives in Childbirth, said that some doctors don't 
have the patience to wait out lengthy labors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against any kind of technology when it's used appropriately and for 
a good cause. Our organization objects when it becomes routine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are not trained to handle normal birth," he said. "Forceps is a piece 
of the whole pathological orientation doctors have. 
</P>
<P>
"A good midwife has alternative ways to handle a difficult birth. A good 
midwife never uses forceps." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and his Missouri-based organization say that 90% of the obstetricians 
in the United States should be replaced with midwives. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Ruddon of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 
Washington, D.C., called the suggestion that obstetricians are impatient and 
use forceps to speed up deliveries "utterly absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"The data on infant mortality speaks for itself," Ruddon said. She cited 
statistics showing that the U.S. infant mortality rate has declined, to 9.9 
deaths per 1,000 live births in 1987 from 47 in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a West Virginia jury awarded $15.25 million to a couple who 
claimed that their obstetrician should have performed a Cesarean section to 
prevent brain damage to their child and instead used forceps, which caused a 
brain hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Calif., Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. came under scrutiny for using 
forceps to hasten the delivery of a girl so that she could be on nationwide 
television as perhaps the first baby of the year in the region. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy Myra Kristine Palmer (6 pounds, 12 ounces) was delivered seconds 
after midnight, quickly cleaned, wrapped in a blanket, stuffed into a Christmas 
stocking and rushed to a religious service being televised in a studio next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the mother push at 11:59," Turner said. "I put the forceps on and 
pulled the infant out. We had her at 15 seconds after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the forceps because I wanted to have the first baby of the new year," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The California attorney general's office filed charges of gross negligence and 
incompetence against Turner on Aug. 6. Prosecutors say his license should be 
suspended or revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Both the doctor and Myra's father, Gary Palmer, insist that Brigitte Palmer 
went into labor prematurely and was sufficiently dilated to begin delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing done that was wrong in this case," he said. Turner, 64, said 
he used forceps in more than 5,000 of about 18,000 deliveries he has performed 
in 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, 27, whose wife and daughter have had no complications since the birth, 
said he trusts Turner, who also delivered Palmer's first daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing his best," Palmer said. "I'd go to him for anything, from the 
common cold to major surgery."

Business was brisk, the music loud and the sunny scene spicy with the fumes of 
marijuana and broiling polish sausage Saturday at the 21st birthday of 
Berkeley's top radical symbol, People's Park. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far cry from the dawn of May 15, 1969, when this vacant lot three 
blocks from the University of California campus erupted in a screaming, 
club-swinging riot in which one person died and more than 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a generation, People's Park has represented to Berkeley's 
assorted street people and longhairs a lasting victory over usually sacrosanct 
American private property rights.

JUDGE ORDERS TRIAL FOR MAN WHO AIDED WIFE'S DEATH

<P>
A 72-year-old man who said love moved him to complete his terminally ill wife's 
suicide attempt was ordered Friday to stand trial on murder and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram Harper faces mandatory life imprisonment if convicted of conspiring to 
murder his 69-year-old wife, Virginia, who died Aug. 19 in the motel room they 
rented after flying to Michigan from their home in Loomis, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Harper planned her suicide after learning she was terminally ill with 
breast and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The murder case against Harper rests largely on his telling police that he put 
a plastic bag over his wife's head and secured it around her neck after a 
non-lethal combination of pills and alcohol caused her to fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
The official cause of death was asphyxiation, according to the Wayne County 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Henry Zaborowski ordered Harper tried on one count of open 
murder -- which may be defined at trial as first- or second-degree murder, or 
manslaughter -- and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Shanda McGrew, 40, Mrs. Harper's daughter and Harper's stepdaughter, flew to 
Michigan with them and was present at her mother's death. She is an unindicted 
co-conspirator in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Zaborowski let Harper return to California under $25,000 bond. He probably will 
not have to return to Michigan until his trial begins in late October or early 
November, defense lawyer Hugh Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a retired engineer, was asked after the hearing whether he feared 
spending the rest of his life in prison. "I don't think it's ever going to get 
to that point," he replied. "But if it comes to that, I'm 72 years old. I don't 
have that much time left." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after his wife's death, Harper told police they had chose to come to 
Michigan because they believed the state had no law making it illegal to assist 
in a suicide. Under California law, such an act is a felony, punishable by up 
to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Harper cited a 1983 Michigan Court of Appeals ruling listed in a book by Derek 
Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock Society, which advocates death on 
demand for the terminally ill. Mrs. Harper was a member of the Eugene, 
Ore.-based group, which is paying for Harper's legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Wayne County prosecutor Timothy Kenny argued that the ruling did not 
outweigh a 1920 case in which the state Supreme Court upheld the first-degree 
murder conviction of a man who mixed poison for his ailing wife and left it 
within her reach. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny argued that Harper, in tying the bag over his sleeping wife's head and 
not calling police until an hour after she stopped breathing, did more than 
simply assist in her death. 
</P>
<P>
Under Michigan law, first-degree murder is punished by mandatory life 
imprisonment; second-degree murder by up to life imprisonment, and manslaughter 
by up to 15 years in prison.

A 27-year-old Marine drill instructor has been booked into the Imperial County 
Jail on suspicion of murder after allegedly digging a hole off an isolated 
desert road to bury his wife's body, officials said. Michael Kenneth La Faver, 
27, is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, a jail spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday, two U.S. Border Patrol officers spotted a car 
parked near Dunaway Road on the south side of Interstate 8, said Chief Deputy 
Michael Hackett of the Imperial County Sheriff's Department. The officers 
approached the car because the area is popular spot to smuggle people over from 
Mexico, Hackett said. They saw La Faver, who Hackett said told the officers he 
was working out. "The officers got suspicious because people don't work out in 
the middle of the desert in 100-degree heat," Hackett said Saturday. Inside the 
car, officers found the body of a woman who apparently had been strangled. She 
was identified as La Faver's wife, Rebecca Joy La Faver, 27, of El Cajon, from 
whom he had been separated for a few weeks. The couple have two sons, both 
under 4.

<P>
On a drab Bucharest street, an 8-year-old boy hawks beer for twice the price it 
was intended to sell for in the empty shop it failed to reach. Nearby, his 
father buys dollars from tourists at an inflated exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
From a car in Sofia's bitpazar market, a dealer sells sugar and soap powder, 
which have long vanished from the dreary stores of the Bulgarian capital, where 
they once cost a third of today's price. 
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, visitors from all over Eastern Europe hawk consumer goods that are 
either unavailable or too expensive in Hungarian stores. Poles, Russians and 
Vietnamese are changing money on the streets of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The dark days of communism may have passed and Eastern Europe may be moving 
toward capitalism, but black markets are thriving in the region as its people 
struggle with weak local currencies and shortages of food and consumer goods 
during the painful transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Poland and Yugoslavia, which have opted for economic shock therapy, have 
virtually wiped out their once-rampant currency black markets in a single 
stroke through reforms that made their currencies convertible. 
</P>
<P>
However, while the new democratic governments of Czechoslovakia and Hungary 
have a clear commitment to the market, shortages persist and the black market 
economy could remain a lifeline for their citizens until the new system is 
firmly in place. 
</P>
<P>
Romania and Bulgaria, ruled by former communists, have an ambivalent attitude 
toward market economy. As they hesitate to dismantle inefficient state sectors, 
black market activity is running wild and the governments seem at a loss in 
coping with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad the Socialist (formerly Communist) Party won the Bulgarian 
elections," said Todor, a black market dealer in Sofia's bitpazar, a bazaar 
where everything from baby food to car parts changes hands at inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only system under which my business could survive. Soaring 
inflation, empty shops and hungry people are the best possible conditions for 
my business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is bringing back rationing in response to dire shortages of essentials 
such as sugar, cooking oil and detergent. "These things are the real currency 
in Bulgaria," said the black marketeer. "Without them you are a poor man." 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent crackdowns by Romanian police, similar markets have sprouted 
along the streets, providing clothes, food, electronic goods and other luxuries 
brought in from abroad or illegally diverted from Romanian factories. 
</P>
<P>
The police arrested 1,500 black marketeers last month, but the trade continues 
to grow, and the government is drafting new laws to regulate it, ranging from 
the mundane to the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian customs recently seized 100 pounds of mercury from Romanian travelers 
crossing into Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The valuable mercury could have been sold for a handsome sum in Istanbul, where 
the travelers could have bought jeans, cigarettes and cosmetics -- prized 
products in short supply back home. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines of cars form in Romanian towns to buy gasoline. Line-jumpers 
discreetly hand the pump attendant a couple of packets of Kent cigarettes, 
Romania's stablest currency, and, as if by magic, their tank is filled. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians hop across the border into Yugoslavia to top off their tanks because 
fuel is often virtually impossible to buy at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists get seven Bulgarian leva for one U.S. dollar at official exchange 
offices, while on the street they can get 11 leva. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar officially fetches 20 Romanian lei, but the black marketeers give up 
to 140 lei per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians line up outside travel agents and banks for the $75 worth of hard 
currency they are allowed once in two years for traveling abroad. Many of them 
immediately change it into lei on the black market. 
</P>

The currency weakness in both countries gives racketeers a field day, enabling 
them to grow rich overnight.

One returned Romanian emigrant, using lei obtained at the black market rate, 
bought tons of furniture cheaply, shipped it to Sweden for sale and became an 
instant millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, the black market turns over an estimated $200-million worth 
of hard currency per year, more than the country's income from organized 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
But the exchange rate difference has steadily narrowed, and the government has 
introduced currency auctions as a first step toward creating a regular foreign 
exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for hard currency is high among Czechoslovaks, who are officially 
allowed only 100 West German marks (about $65) per year for travel abroad.

BOAS, PYTHONS ON THE CRAWL IN FLORIDA; 
</P>
<P>
SNAKES DUMPED IN FLORIDA GROW INTO BIG PROBLEMS 
</P>

In just two years, an exotic snake abandoned in the wild can grow from a cute 
pet into a raccoon-eating monster, and large snakes are becoming a large animal 
control problem in southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Big pythons and boa constrictors have been popping up with unwelcome 
regularity, but the capture of 15-, 12- and 10-foot snakes within eight days in 
June in Palm Beach County were evidence the problem is getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think it's nifty to have these snakes as pets," said Ron 
Magill, assistant curator of Miami's MetroZoo. "Within a few years, that snake 
can exceed 10 feet. . . . They're also escape artists." 
</P>
<P>
But the escapees are only part of the problem in a region that offers an ideal 
climate for the cold-blooded, cold-wary animals. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts believe dozens of snakes have been abandoned in the wild by 
pet owners after the novelty wears off, the feeding gets too expensive, medical 
bills get too high or the snakes become a threat to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They release it, evidently unaware or not caring about the impact on the 
natural environment or the human population in Florida," said Lt. Jim 
Hoffstodt, spokesman for the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission in West 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Todd Hardwick, a private trapper of nuisance animals, captured 
20-foot, 250-pound Big Mama, a reticulated python that landed him and her on 
"The Tonight Show." A crawl space under a Ft. Lauderdale house was the snake's 
home -- apparently for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I get reports all the time of big snakes down on Old Cutler Road," a suburban 
Miami thoroughfare that borders mangrove swamps, Hardwick said. "Airboaters and 
hunters see big ones in the Everglades, so there's a lot more out there." 
</P>
<P>
State officials acknowledge that they don't have a good grasp on the numbers. 
But Magill warned: "Keep in mind, I think for every snake that's found, there's 
10 of them that are never seen." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, the Port of Miami handled imports of 1.26 million reptiles, 
including snakes, turtles and lizards. A total of 18,150 ball pythons, a 
constrictor known to curl up in a ball, cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize the sheer amounts of animals moving through this country, 
the amounts being imported into the United States for the pet trade," said Lt. 
Tom Quinn of the U.S. Custom Service's inspections division in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
And Hardwick said he has found baby constrictors at two locations in Miami's 
Dade County, indicating that the big snakes may be mating in the wild. Boas can 
give birth to 60 offspring at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest may be ahead. A python "as big as Big Mama or bigger yet" is 
being spotted every few months in a rugged, inaccessible area of Dade County, 
Hardwick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for my opportunity to apprehend it," he said, refusing to disclose 
the location. 
</P>
<P>
The state tightened regulation of venomous reptiles July 1 to require one 
year's experience with the species, but non-venomous snakes such as the 
constricting boas and pythons aren't covered. No permit is needed for 
ownership.

Lauderdale, Fla. The discovery of 10-, 15- and 20-foot snakes in South Florida 
is an animal control problem that seems to grow each year, officials say.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE FOLLOWED HIS ORDERS, BUT PLAN FAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On opening day of the 1933 NFL season, Washington Redskins owner George Preston 
Marshall instructed Coach William (Lone Star) Dietz to kick off if the Redskins 
won the coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
When Marshall arrived at his seat, he looked down at the field and saw his team 
lined up to receive. He immediately picked up his phone to the bench and 
demanded to know why Dietz had disobeyed his order. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dietz: "We did kick off, Mr. Marshall. But they ran it back for a 
touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In 1946, the Rams' first season in Los Angeles, what was the 
outcome of their opening game? 
</P>
<P>
Cobb and Carew, they're not: Stealing home never was easy. Chicago police 
proved it again when they caught two men, 19 and 21, trying to steal home plate 
from Comiskey Park shortly after 1 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sharon Gaynor, one of the arresting officers: "They're not career 
criminals, just kids who basically decided that they wanted the plate . . . so 
they'd have some part of the White Sox park for their unborn grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
The park opened in 1910 and will close on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Short pitch: Greg Norman advocates their use. Jack Nicklaus says he wears them 
when he plays at home. 
</P>
<P>
And Tom Kite recently told Len Ziehm of the Chicago Sun-Times: "It certainly 
would be cooler. I don't see anything wrong with seeing a guy's legs. You see 
it in basketball. You see it in track. I don't think that our legs are any more 
offensive than the guys' in those sports." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the PGA Tour and PGA of America forbid the wearing of shorts in major 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
News you can use: From Associated Press: "The distance from the pitcher's mound 
to the plate is 60 feet 6 inches, but he is much closer when he releases the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Move over, Pete Axthelm: The folks at NFL headquarters aren't going to like 
this one bit. It's nearly as disruptive as predicting games against the point 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
No less an authority than Regis Philbin announced Friday on his daytime 
television show that the Detroit Lions are his first choice for the underdog 
team most likely to make it to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe viewers would be better off this year with the pick Philbin 
made last summer for Super Bowl XXIV, the Houston Oilers. Got that? Try the 
Oilers in XXV, the Lions in XXVI. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip genes: Anthony Dorsett Jr., a senior backup wide receiver at 
Richardson (Tex.) Pierce High School, has played very little football. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't matter to USC, West Virginia and Pittsburgh, all of whom have 
contacted the 6-foot, 165-pound wide receiver, whose father, Tony, won the 1976 
Heisman Trophy at Pitt, then went on to become the NFL's No. 2 all-time rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pierce Coach Mike Jennings of the recruiters' attention to Dorsett Jr.: "I 
don't know what they are basing it on, really. He's a good little athlete, he's 
working very hard, and we are very proud he's on the team. But he's pretty shy 
on experience." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Rams lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 25-14, at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Oakland Athletics outfielder Darren Lewis, on being called up from 
triple-A Tacoma to replace Dave Henderson in late August: "I wake up every 
morning and almost can't believe where I am. All I've got to do is look at the 
feather pillows. Most hotel pillows are flat." TED BROCK

DETMER PASSES BRIGHAM YOUNG OVER NO. 1 MIAMI; 
</P>
<P>
COUGARS: QUARTERBACK THROWS FOR 406 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN 28-21 UPSET.

<P>
Little Ty Detmer led Brigham Young to a huge upset over top-ranked Miami 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer passed for 406 yards and three touchdowns as the 16th-ranked Cougars 
shocked the defending national champions, 28-21 -- only the Hurricanes' third 
loss in their last 55 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty Detmer is unbelievable," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. "He's a great, 
great quarterback and he showed it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer, who led the nation in passing last season, outdueled Miami quarterback 
Craig Erickson in what was billed as a battle of Heisman Trophy favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The junior, who is generously called 6 feet and 175 pounds in the BYU brochure, 
picked apart Miami's feared defense with short, pinpoint passes. He completed 
38 of 54 throws, including a seven-yard TD toss to Mike Salido and two-point 
conversion pass to Andy Boyce that gave BYU a 28-21 lead late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, who led Miami to the national title in his first year as a starter, 
completed 28 of 52 passes for 299 yards and no touchdowns. Both quarterbacks 
had one pass intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer's 406 passing yards were the most against Miami since Doug Flutie of 
Boston College threw for 472 yards against the Hurricanes in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this one game will mean I'll win the Heisman," Detmer said. "I'm 
just glad I played well enough for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
Sensational scrambling by Detmer gave him time to get off two of his TD passes, 
a 14-yarder to Matt Bellini in the second quarter and the winning toss to 
Salido in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I do out there," said Detmer, who needed six stitches at 
halftime to close a deep cut on his chin caused by a Miami tackle. "I just run 
around and jump out of the way when I feel something coming. I guess I learned 
it from playing in the front yard." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer's performance thrilled a record crowd of 66,235 on a warm night at 
Cougar Stadium and impressed his Miami counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty played an outstanding game," Craig Erickson said. "He really ignited the 
place tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Miami drove into BYU territory twice late in the fourth quarter, but both 
drives were halted by Cougar cornerback Ervin Lee. Lee intercepted a pass in 
the end zone with 6:28 left and knocked away another Erickson pass on the BYU 
goal line with 1:49 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the opening game of the season for Miami, which defeated BYU in their 
only previous meeting, 41-17 in 1988. BYU opened its season last week with a 
30-10 victory over Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
BYU's other points came on field goals by Earl Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's scores came on a pair of short TD runs by Steve McGuire in the first 
half and a five-yard run by Leonard Conley in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, which led the nation in total defense last season, was shredded by the 
BYU offense. The Cougars outgained the Hurricanes 474-395 and had the edge in 
first downs 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
Although BYU dominated the first half, the Cougars led only 17-14 at halftime 
because of four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer, who led the nation in passing last season, completed 26 of 35 throws 
for 289 yards and two touchdowns in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's defense, which allowed only 217 yards per game last season, gave up 332 
in the first half against BYU while the Hurricanes' offense gained only 134 
yards. Erickson completed six of 11 passes for just 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
BYU's first two drives were halted by fumbles, one by Detmer and the other by 
Salido. 
</P>
<P>
After Darryl Williams recovered Salido's fumble at the Miami 21, the Hurricanes 
drove down the field and scored on a seven-yard run by McGuire. The big play in 
the drive was a 40-yard run by fullback Alex Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
BYU scored on its opening drive of the second period to tie it at 7-7. Detmer 
completed five passes in the 60-yard drive, including a scrambling scoring toss 
to a wide-open Bellini in the left corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took a 10-7 lead midway through the period on a 32-yard field goal 
by Kauffman, but Miami capitalized on another BYU turnover to regain the lead 
near the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After catching a pass from Detmer, Brent Nyberg fumbled and the ball was 
recovered by Miami's Hurlie Brown on the BYU 43. The Hurricanes then drove for 
the go-ahead score, a 2-yard run by McGuire with 1:48 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But BYU came right back and marched 74 yards for a touchdown. Detmer completed 
seven passes in the drive, including a 23-yarder to Salido that brought the 
ball to the Miami 2. From there, Detmer hit Boyce in the right corner of the 
end zone to put BYU ahead 17-14.

MIKE DOWNEY: BRUIN PERFORMANCE AGAINST OKLAHOMA RATED TBD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now winless in its last seven football games, UCLA could be a sequel in the 
making: 
</P>
<P>
"Die Harder." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's season opener was a real eye-opener, even for UCLA's coaches. The 
34-14 loss to Oklahoma left quarterback coach Homer Smith, like everybody else 
at the Rose Bowl, uncertain who UCLA's quarterback is. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Jim Bonds would start again next week, Smith shrugged and said: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that." 
</P>
<P>
Had Bret Johnson stayed and played instead of bootlegging to Michigan State, he 
would have been put to work against Oklahoma no later than the third quarter, 
and possibly would be starting next week's game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the obvious difference between last year's team and this year's team is 
that this year's team changes quarterbacks faster. 
</P>
<P>
Like, by the play. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a quality quarterback coach in search of a quality quarterback, played 
Bonds in the first half, Tommy Maddox in the second half and Bert Emanuel on 
third down. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth down, he let the punter punt. 
</P>
<P>
In his return engagement after two years at Alabama, the offensive coordinator 
ended up on the defensive. He couldn't even bring himself to specifically 
evaluate his quarterbacks' performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still thinking of what I did wrong," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed himself for not knowing how to attack Oklahoma's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just dead-set on not letting us roll to the outside," Smith said. "I 
wish we hadn't tried it as many times as we did, frankly. That's my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Not that UCLA's defensive preparation was much better. This unit was not at all 
prepared to contain the Sooners when they rolled to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA strong safety Matt Darby: "We couldn't stop them sometimes, and the 
main thing was their speed. Our second team (in practice) couldn't simulate 
their speed. We were a step slow against Oklahoma all day." 
</P>
<P>
And UCLA's special-teams unit needn't take any bows, either. 
</P>
<P>
On the official flip card published before the game, one position on UCLA's 
side -- punt return -- was listed as "TBD." This stood for "To Be Determined" 
-- and now we understand why. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the way UCLA handled punts Saturday, all we can say is that for next 
week this position still needs to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
It was the offense that was most painful to watch, though -- for Smith, for 
Terry Donahue, for everybody who bled blue. 
</P>
<P>
Four first downs by rushing. Twenty-eight yards net rushing. Four passes 
intercepted. Three footballs fumbled. Ugh. 
</P>
<P>
The passing game got no passing grade from Princeton graduate Smith, who, to 
quote Homer, said the quarterbacks "just couldn't airify the ball." 
</P>
<P>
If that means pumping air into it, they could. If that means passing it into a 
teammate's hands, they couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
And what happened when the Bruins got close to the enemy goal line? Foul-ups 
happened. One play was nullified because they had too many men on the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the problem of getting guys onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
Smith pulled a trick from his hat in which one quarterback, Emanuel, relieved 
another quarterback, Maddox, on third down. This was a device designed to make 
use of Emanuel's ability to run with the football. 
</P>
<P>
Only what it turned out to be was to show Emanuel's ability to run from 
tacklers. Once he even went backward nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my fault, too," Smith insisted. "I didn't have the unit on the field 
soon enough. I hadn't tested it in a combat situation. Everybody was watching 
the shot clock. We wanted to get his (Emanuel's) legs into the game, but we 
weren't organized. That cost us." 
</P>
<P>
An exasperating day, yes? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, an exasperating day," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
For his quarterbacks, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what a big disappointment the whole thing was," said Bonds, whose 
appointment as starting quarterback was what got Bret Johnson digging out his 
old Big Ten recruiting brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds looked good for a while but had trouble guiding the ball into the end 
zone. That's why it came as no shock when the coaches went to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"When your starting quarterback goes out there and the offense sputters, you 
expect a change," Bonds said. "That's the way the game works. With Tommy and I 
here, it's probably going to end up like that all year." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox looked a little smoother than Bonds, but did so against a defense of 
Oklahoma second-stringers or starters wilted from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some mistakes, but also did some positive things to build on," Maddox 
said. "The team in general did the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
So . . . quarterback, quarterback, who's got the quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
Paging Mr. Bret Johnson, white courtesy telephone. Mr. Johnson, please? 
</P>
<P>
Naw, no reason to panic yet. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds hardly expects to forfeit his job after 2 1/2 quarters, but said: "I 
haven't really thought about it. Just have to let the coaches decide. You know, 
play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
What says the quarterback coach? 
</P>
<P>
"We will be very much better immediately," Smith said. "That is my comment on 
the matter. Overall, we will be a better offensive football team. We will be 
very much better right away. That's my promise. We are going to be immediately 
better." 
</P>
<P>
To be determined.

OKLAHOMA'S ORDERS: PLAY LIKE CHAMPION; 
</P>
<P>
SOONERS: THEY DO EXACTLY THAT AGAINST UCLA IN BEGINNING OF AN ATTEMPT TO ERASE 
CLOUDS OF THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Saturday matinee in Pasadena was a revival of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot to prove," said defensive tackle Scott Evans after the Sooners 
proved they were better than UCLA, 34-14. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we lost to Colorado and Nebraska in our conference. I don't even 
know what we were ranked coming into this game. We were underdogs to a team 
that went 3-7-1 last year. This was a big win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gibbs agreed. Gibbs is the guy who replaced Barry Switzer as coach of 
Oklahoma last year. If you thought Gibbs was brand new on the job, maybe it's 
because he has a low profile, and his first Sooner team had a 7-4 record and 
was not seen on television or in a bowl because it was on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners' conduct off the field was unnoticed, too, because Gibbs is the 
disciplinarian that Switzer apparently wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Written on the chalkboard of Gibbs' dressing room and on pieces of paper tacked 
to his players' lockers Saturday was this message: 
</P>
<P>
"Play Like a Champion. Beat UCLA Today." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said the Sooners carried out those orders pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm a very happy football coach," Gibbs said. "And I've got 60 
players who are very happy and excited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to win on national television against a quality opponent. We worked 
like champions in the spring and summer, and it was time to go out and play 
like champions." 
</P>
<P>
The unit best showing championship form was a defense that held UCLA to 28 
yards rushing, 203 net yards and 10 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't establish their running game, and it's hard to pass in obvious 
situations against five defensive backs," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had new quarterbacks, and we felt we could put that to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins also had a new-old offensive coordinator in Homer Smith, who was 
starting his third tour with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"He was there the last time we played them in 1986, so we had a reference 
point," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who seemed familiar with the UCLA scheme was Evans, a 6-3, 
251-pound senior who was voted All-Big Eight the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an attacking, physical defense," he said. "Our attitude is very good. I 
look to either side and behind me, and I see a lot of guys who have worked very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Evans said this was the typical Oklahoma defense, with the same sets it has 
used during his five years in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
This was also typical Oklahoma offense. When passers Steve Collins and Cale 
Gundy were cold -- four for 18 for 44 yards -- the Sooners rushed for 299 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the game, we found out their line wasn't as good as their 
secondary," said Collins, who ran for 85 yards. "We hit 'em in their weak 
spots." 
</P>
<P>
At least, Collins didn't question the Bruins' manhood, as Brian Bosworth did 
after the Sooners won, 38-3, on opening day of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a great team in 1986. We weren't a great team today," Gibbs said. 
"That team had a 'Who's Who.' But, like that team, we had success on both sides 
of the line of scrimmage today." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs' fullback, Kenyon Rasheed, didn't want to hear history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to focus on the present, not the past," he said. "They did their 
thing, and now we have to establish ourselves. Sure, the tradition was 
tarnished by what happened off the field, but we can't control that. We just 
have to show that we're a nice football team."

<P>
Fresno State avenged its only loss last season by defeating New Mexico, 24-17, 
Saturday night in a nonconference game at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico stunned the Bulldogs, 45-22, in Albuquerque at the end of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (2-0) have won 18 consecutive games at home and have 20 victories 
in their last 21 games overall. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Craver gained 175 yards in 31 carries and scored two touchdowns to lead 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Barsotti completed 27 of 38 passes for career-high 301 yards 
and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Craver scored on a 61-yard run early in the third quarter to give Fresno State 
a 17-14 lead and later scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State took a 7-0 lead on a 14-yard scoring pass from Barsotti to Marty 
Thompson in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But New Mexico (0-1) led at halftime, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific 41, CS Sacramento 33 -- Kris King passed for 289 yards and four 
touchdowns in leading the Tigers (1-1) at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento's Bobby Fresques, who passed for 329 yards and three touchdowns, was 
taken from the field by ambulance after being hit in the back with about 5 1/2 
minutes to play. He was hospitalized; the seriousness of his injury was not 
known.

<P>
TITANS: AFTER JUMPING TO A 31-3 HALFTIME LEAD, THIRD-RANKED AUBURN IS GIVEN A 
GAME, 38-17.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton flies home from Auburn today with its $250,000 guarantee 
check and an unexpected piece of carry-on luggage -- a big bag of respect. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans didn't exactly put fear into the hearts of 77,500 fans in 
Jordan-Hare Stadium, but they did give the third-ranked Tigers a decent game 
before losing, 38-17, a score not nearly as lopsided as most anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton outscored Auburn, 14-0, in the third quarter, their second touchdown 
coming on a play reminiscent of Pittsburgh Steeler running back Franco Harris' 
Immaculate Reception, to turn a 31-3 deficit into a 31-17 game. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans forced a punt on Auburn's next possession and would have had good 
field position had return man Greg West not fumbled the ball away at the Titan 
41-yard line. The Tigers later scored on Stan White's 13-yard pass to Greg 
Taylor -- the redshirt freshman quarterback's fourth touchdown pass of the game 
-- to make it 38-17 with 11:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't win, but it was a big, big moral victory for us," Fullerton kicker 
Phil Nevin said. "I think people were expecting a Long Beach-Clemson type score 
(59-0 last week), but they're going to look at this and say, 'Wow, they gave 
them a ballgame.' We played a hell of a second half, and their first team was 
in there most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
To Fullerton's credit, the Titans' offensive success didn't come against the 
Tigers' third- and fourth-string players. Auburn Coach Pat Dye shuffled 
reserves in and out of the game but never pulled entire starting units. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton quarterback Paul Schulte, going against a defense many consider to be 
among the nation's best, completed 17 of 28 passes for 235 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have told me before the game that (preseason All-American 
defensive tackle) David Rocker and (All-American offensive guard) Ed King would 
be in there at the end, I would have thought there was something the matter 
with you," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But our kids played very hard the 
whole game. Auburn was flat, and justifiably so, but they weren't playing 
against air, either." 
</P>
<P>
It only seemed that way in the first half when the Tigers scored on five of 
their six possessions. White had plenty of time to carve up the Titan 
secondary, completing 14 of 22 first-half attempts for 241 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet we were wide-eyed at the start of the game," Murphy said. "To say 
anything else would be lying. Our most inexperienced players are on offense, 
and it took us time to get in the flow. But we gained more confidence in the 
second half once we found out we could move the football." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finally found the end zone late in the third quarter when Schulte 
completed four of four passes on a 49-yard drive, the last a five-yarder to 
J.J. Celestine to make it 31-10 with 2:42 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, from the Titan 34, Schulte threw to Celestine up the left 
sideline. Celestine and Tiger cornerback Mike Pina went up for the ball, and 
Pina tipped it in the air. The players collided and fell, but Celestine managed 
to kick the ball to teammate Reggie Yarbrough, who snared the deflection at the 
Fullerton 47 and raced into the end zone for a 66-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton defensive back Terry Tramble suffered a broken arm in the first half 
and might be out for the season. . . . The Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Enquirer, in 
its prediction for the game in Saturday morning's paper, said it would be 
"Auburn by two. By two minutes, it will be over." Added a Ledger-Enquirer 
columnist: "The Tigers don't really start the season until next week at Ole 
Miss. Auburn invited 75,000 or 85,000 of its fans to Jordan-Hare Stadium for a 
scrimmage."

Blaise Bryant scored four touchdowns to tie a school record and rushed for 177 
yards Saturday as Iowa State opened the season with a 35-6 victory over 
Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, the nation's top returning rusher, is from Cypress High and was a 
junior college All-American at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up right where he left off last season, when he ran for 1,516 yards 
and 19 touchdowns. He carried 36 times and scored on runs of one, two, three 
and 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State led, 7-6, in the third quarter before Bryant scored three times in a 
span of 8:06 to break the game open. The Cyclones held Northern Iowa (1-1), a 
Division I-AA team, to 57 yards rushing and 204 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's four rushing touchdowns tied an Iowa State record first set by George 
Amundson in 1971 and matched by Dwayne Crutchfield in 1981 and Joe Henderson in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant also tied a Cyclone Stadium record with his 24 points, tying 
Crutchfield, Iowa's Owen Gill (1983), Missouri's Marlon Adler (1983) and 
Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders (1988).

Kevin Bogan and Larry Sims each rushed for more than 100 yards and a touchdown 
Saturday night at El Paso, Tex., as Texas El Paso defeated New Mexico State, 
27-24, extending the nation's longest losing streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Sims, who gained 112 yards in 11 carries, scored on a 55-yard run in the third

New Mexico State (0-2) closed to within 27-24 on a two-yard pass from David 
Chisum to Alvin Warren with 4:25 left in the game.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

DRABEK WINS 19TH FOR PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reliance the Pittsburgh Pirates have on Doug Drabek is of major concern to 
the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
When the talented right-hander takes the mound these days, the Pirates count 
the game a victory. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that way for most of the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek gave up seven hits in 7 2/3 innings at Pittsburgh and the Pirates turned 
on their tormentors Saturday night, the Montreal Expos, 6-1. Drabek, beaten 
only once since June 28, improved his record to 19-5 and kept the Pirates 3 1/2 
games in front of the Mets in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Van Slyke and Sid Bream hit home runs for the Pirates, who had lost three 
in a row to the Expos. Van Slyke drove in three runs to lead the Pirates to 
their seventh victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway point of the season, it was speculated that the battle for the 
Cy Young Award was between Ramon Martinez of the Dodgers and Frank Viola of the 
New York Mets. There was no mention of Drabek. 
</P>
<P>
Since then Drabek is 11-1 and has become the leading candidate to win the 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can worry about 20, because that's my next one," said Drabek, the first 
Pirate to win 19 games in 11 years. "I kind of shove all that Cy Young stuff 
aside because the race is a long way from over. All I want to do is win the 
pennant." 
</P>
<P>
New York 12, Philadelphia 2 -- The Mets got 12 hits for Dwight Gooden (16-6), 
including home runs by Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies, and ended their 
six-game losing streak against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so much they hit Bruce Ruffin, it was that he couldn't find the 
plate. He gave up three hits and four walks before departing in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden pitched a five-hitter and struck out 10. San Francisco 2, Houston 1 -- 
Matt Williams' second home run of the game at San Francisco came with two out 
in the 10th inning to give the Giants the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Williams leads the league with 107 runs batted in and has 29 home runs. The big 
surprise is his .285 average. After three seasons and 220 games, Williams had a 
.198 average. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know he would hit this consistently," Manager Roger Craig said. "His 
high average is a major plus." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, St. Louis 4 -- After Cardinal left-hander Ken Dayley brushed back 
Mark Grace twice in the seventh inning at Chicago, Grace responded with his 
eighth home run to break a 4-4 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ryne Sandberg of the Cubs hit his league-leading 33rd home run. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 11, San Diego 5 -- A throwing error by San Diego rookie Paul Faries set 
up a five-run eighth inning as the Braves rallied in San Diego for their eighth 
victory in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
With Atlanta trailing, 5-4, Dave Justice and Mark Lemke opened the eighth with 
consecutive singles off Derek Lilliquist (3-9). 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson bunted down the third-base line off Greg Harris and Faries picked 
up the ball bare-handed and threw wildly to first. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Roberto Alomar, who was covering, was hit by Olson as he reached 
for the throw and the ball rolled into foul territory as Justice and Lemke 
scored and Olson advanced to third. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Thomas' single made it 7-5 and Lonnie Smith hit a two-run homer. Thomas 
added another RBI single in the ninth and scored on Jeff Blauser's groundout.

C'MON AL, JUST GIVE US A LITTLE HINT . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me get this straight, the Raiders are opening the season here again? 
</P>
<P>
A year after they took "Los Angeles" off their merchandise and introduced their 
Generic Raider line, six months after announcing they were Oakland-bound, 
they're still around, complaining about the treachery of politicians and 
negotiating with all they can find from the Bay Area to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Despite speculation that the team could be yanked up to Oakland at any moment, 
Al Davis refuses to say what he's up to. Who ever saw anything like it, a major 
franchise dangling over the plum Los Angeles market on a string? 
</P>
<P>
The best Davis could do, after reports of an imminent move this summer, was to 
say: "We expect to play in Los Angeles, but anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
How would season-ticket holders feel about a four-game plan? Weekly charter 
flights to Oakland? A Sunday party at the old facility in El Segundo to watch 
the game on big-screen TV? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, local Raider fans are owed more, as are Oakland fans. But granting 
this decency would deny Davis his lifelong penchant for playing one side 
against the other. Everyone will just have to wait till the moving trucks roll. 
</P>
<P>
Raider inner-circle types are as much in the dark as anyone, but not all remain 
by their phones. 
</P>
<P>
One L.A. Raider loyalist, Bud Furillo, midwife of the move south, resigned. 
Furillo was the man who hung a "Welcome Los Angeles Raiders" banner from the 
Coliseum press box at a 1979 Ram-Raider game -- three years before the Raiders 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Furillo sat at Davis' knee, as much as anyone could, taking into account that 
withdrawn style Davis inflicts upon employees. Furillo says Al used to phone 
him four times a week, but after Furillo became editor of Raider Weekly, it 
once took Davis a week to return a call. After the death of Davis' friend, 
Dodger scout Don McMahon, in 1987, Furillo says Davis called him late at night, 
and they wept like babies. 
</P>
<P>
Furillo and Davis aren't as tight any more. Raider officials run on unrequited 
hero worship until they abandon all hope. There is no more embittered exile 
than an ex-Raider. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think they're headed to Oakland," Furillo says. "I don't think there's 
any question about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Al since 1957. I've always appreciated his accomplishments. He did 
a lot. He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. At the same time, there's a 
darker side that isn't that nice. There are silver and black sides of Al Davis, 
and the black has overcome the silver." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, Raider indecision on the grand level contrasts with progress 
on the field. The team looks better. The defensive front looks as if it could 
be a vintage striking weapon again, capable of leading a resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
This could compound local unhappiness. We get four years of Davis tripping over 
his shoelaces. Oakland gets the rebuilt team? 
</P>
<P>
An announcement is expected within days, weeks, months, for sure before the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Davis loyalists note that three deals -- with Los Angeles, Irwindale and 
Oakland -- have already fallen apart, so he's entitled to make sure. Maybe he 
would have less trouble if he wasn't always trying to get the bidding as high 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
If he wants to go to Oakland, why doesn't he just deal with Oakland? If he 
wants to stay, why not just deal with Los Angeles? Is all he wants in life the 
best deal he can extort? Is he incapable of assuming good faith by anyone? 
</P>
<P>
Dear Al, if you're going -- to borrow a phrase from a famous Raider's sneaker 
commercials -- just do it.

A 35-year-old man fell to his death from the top of Veterans Stadium during the 
early innings of the baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the 
New York Mets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released, fell from the 700 level to the 300 level 
and landed on a cement ramp behind the stadium seats, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Lt. Richard Eife said the fall appears to have been an accident and 
homicide detectives were not called. He added that alcohol may have been 
involved.

WILLIE WOOD FINALLY FALTERS, FALLS INTO TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As next-door neighbors and college teammates, Willie Wood and Bob Tway played a 
lot of rounds of golf together. 
</P>
<P>
As co-leaders heading into today's final round of the Hardee's Golf Classic at 
Coal Valley, Ill., they'll play one more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many hundreds of rounds we've played together," Wood said 
after he double-bogeyed No. 18 to fall back into the tie with his Oklahoma City 
neighbor and Oklahoma State teammate at 199, 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
Two shots back were second-round leader Billy Mayfair, first-round leader Jeff 
Sluman, Jim Gallagher Jr. and Jay Delsing. Mayfair had a 71, Delsing a 70, 
Gallagher a 67 and Sluman a 65 at the Oakwood Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was cruising toward his second consecutive bogey-free round before he hit 
his tee shot on the final hole out of bounds and had to settle for a two-under 
68. 
</P>
<P>
Tway, who carded a third-round 67, said if he couldn't win the $180,000 first 
prize, he hoped Wood did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to see him playing well," Tway said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been more successful than I," said Wood, looking for his first title 
after more than six years on the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Tway tied for fifth at Phoenix and tied for seventh at the Bob 
Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 golfers are within five shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher beat Mayfair in a playoff for last weekend's Greater Milwaukee Open 
title and the two will be together again in one of today's threesomes. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Harrington got the first hole in one of the tournament when he used a 
six-iron on the 174-yard No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Rives McBee finished with an eagle to shoot a five-under 67 
for a two-stroke lead in the Senior Tour event at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
McBee, who won his first Seniors event in the 1989 tournament, birdied No. 17 
before the eagle on the 531-yard final hole on the Kearney Hill Golf Links. He 
had a 36-hole total of 133, 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
Quinton Gray shot a 67 to stay two strokes behind McBee. Lee Trevino pulled 
into contention with a 66, and is at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo overcame wrist problems with a six-under-par 64 to move two shots 
behind Gordon Brand in the European Open golf championship at Sunningdale, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Brand, from England, shot a 65 to give him a one-stroke edge over Welshman Ian 
Woosnam, Jose Maria Canizares of Spain and Australian Peter Senior. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley shot a 68 to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA event at Portland, 
Ore. Bradley is at six-under 138, one up on Dottie Mochrie and Sherri Turner.

NEWSWIRE: HEYWARD SUES AGENT BRUCE ALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Craig (Ironhead) Heyward of the New Orleans Saints has filed a 
$3.3-million lawsuit against sports agent Bruce Allen, charging breach of 
contract and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Friday in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, charges 
Allen, his former partner Bob Owens, and their GBA Sportsworld agency with 
consumer and securities fraud, racketeering, breach of contract and breach of 
fiduciary duty in a real-estate deal. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is the son of George Allen, football coach at Cal State Long Beach. Owens 
was interim head coach in 1979 at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward's suit alleges that in the summer of 1988, Owens met with Heyward and 
his wife, Charlotte, to discuss investing in a condominium project in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Heyward understood he was investing in actual property when 
instead he was investing in a promissory note. It also alleges that Owens and 
Allen were involved in the development and did not disclose their interest. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges Heyward suffered damages of $450,000 in investment losses, 
fees paid and lost investment opportunities while his money was tied up in the 
condominium investment. The suit seeks treble damages, which are granted in 
Arizona law in some instances, plus $1 million in punitive damages from each 
defendant.

BALDOMERO WINS OSUNITAS, GIVES SHOEMAKER FIRST STAKES VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago and one day after his biggest milestone, Bill Shoemaker came 
up with another on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Baldomero, a 9-1 shot in the $83,025 Osunitas Handicap, provided the world's 
winningest rider with his first stakes victory as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old Pas de Seul mare's victory over 50-1 shot Kikala and eight 
others almost coincided with the 20-year anniversary of Shoemaker's historic 
6,033rd victory. On Sept. 7, 1970, he guided Dares J. into the winner's circle 
and propelled himself past John Longden. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being his first stakes victory, the Osunitas was Shoemaker's initial 
success at the Del Mar meeting. He was 0 for 16 going into the restricted race 
after a solid Hollywood Park season. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to say?" Shoemaker said after Baldomero won by 
three-quarters of a length while completing the 1 1/16 miles on turf in 1:42. 
"(Gary Stevens) rode her well. She ran well. The last time, she had to go 
around the field and Wedding Bouquet (the 9-5 favorite Saturday) got through on 
the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great. I predicted she would be a stakes winner when these people 
bought the horse. It makes you feel good when your predictions come true." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Baldomero has been a model of consistency since coming to the United 
States. She hasn't been worse than second in five starts and the Osunitas was 
her second victory. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't that good a filly in Europe, but she's improved over here," 
Shoemaker said. "Probably the air. She blossomed out; she's a better-looking 
mare. I rode her once at Ascot (in England) and she was kind of washy and 
silly. Mr. (Robert) Sangster sent her over here last year; she was one of the 
first horses I acquired." 
</P>
<P>
Fifth after six furlongs behind the moderate pace being set by Paper Princess, 
Baldomero rallied on the outside through the stretch and was going away at the 
wire. Kikala, the longest shot in the field after finishing last as the 5-2 
favorite in her previous start, defeated Tessla by a neck for second. Wedding 
Bouquet, who was very impressive in her American debut Aug. 22, was another 
head back in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoe told me to ride her like you own her," Stevens said. "That's all he said. 
She's a consistent mare. She gives 100% every time. Today's extra distance 
helped her. 
</P>
<P>
"That mile the other day was just too short. She's only got one quick burst, 
but the distance was to her advantage this time. I'm happy for Shoe." 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron had no excuses for Wedding Bouquet, concluding what was a 
less-than-memorable day for trainer Gary Jones. Earlier, his Timebank had 
finished last as the 6-5 favorite in Belmont's Fall Highweight Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good trip," McCarron said. "She moved up there real nice, but then she 
hung just a tad near the end." 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis is looking for a new agent. 
</P>
<P>
The rider, who has won only four times from 107 tries at Del Mar, and Jeff 
Franklin, his agent since he came to California early in 1989, parted company 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie and I are still friends; it's an amicable parting," said Franklin, who 
previously had worked for Gary Stevens, among others, and is generally 
considered one of the best agents. "There are overriding personal concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to Davis, it's clear the decision to split wasn't his. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," he said. "I'm losing a great agent, probably the best I've ever 
had. It's going to be very hard to replace him. I'm sorry he had to do what he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was off for three weeks with a bad back, then my wife had a baby. There's 
been a lot of stress and we didn't bounce back as well as we had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea, I haven't got a clue (about a new agent). Jeff's been with me 
ever since I came here, so I don't know too many agents out here. I want to 
stay here. That's why I left New York; to come out here." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City is the 4-1 third choice on the morning line for today's $1-million 
Molson Export Million at Woodbine. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Julio Canani and owned by Clover Racing Stable, Kansas City has won 
two in a row since returning from a seven-month layoff. Claimed for $32,000 
late last year, the son of Habitony won a Hollywood Park sprint in his 
comeback, then got his first stakes victory, the Windy Sands Handicap here Aug. 
15. Kansas City, who has won four of seven, will be ridden for the first time 
by Chris McCarron. Clover won the Molson last year with Prized. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia, the Canadian Triple Crown winner, will be the heavy favorite in the 1 
1/4-mile race. Owned by Kinghaven Farm, the son of Icecapade will be shooting 
for his eighth consecutive stakes victory. Don Seymour will ride. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field includes Shot Gun Scott, Baron de Vaux, Bloody Caesar, 
Pleasant Rapture, Piper Gray and Chief Honcho. 
</P>
<P>
A full field of 12 is expected for Wednesday's $350,000-estimated Del Mar 
Futurity, the closing-day feature. 
</P>
<P>
The probable favorite is Best Pal, winner of the Balboa and I'm Smokin stakes 
at the meeting. The gelded son of Habitony will race coupled with Magnificent 
Red, a Secretariat colt who broke his maiden at first asking Aug. 25. Both 
2-year-olds are owned by John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The other probable starters are Sunshine Machine, who will be ridden by Jose 
Santos in his Del Mar debut, Formal Dinner, Bucking Bird, Arctic Deputy, 
Pillaring,. Regional, Terrific Trip, Southern Justice, Got To Fly and Running 
Total. 
</P>
<P>
Of the dozen expected to go, five were supplemented for $10,000 before the 
Friday deadline. They are Sunshine Machine, Formal Dinner, Southern Justice, 
Got To Fly and Running Total. Drag Race, the surprise winner of the Futurity 
last year, was also supplemented. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was senior citizen's day at Del Mar. Trainer Steve Ippolito, 75, won the 
featured Torrey Pines Stakes with 15-1 shot Oh Sweet Thing and, five races 
earlier, L.J. Brooks, who will turn 84 Sept. 28, clicked with 5-1 shot Chief 
Dare. Brooks is the oldest trainer ever to win a race at Del Mar. . . . Russell 
Baze and Julio Garcia both won twice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham will start two of the four entrants in today's $206,300 Del 
Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup over a mile. Ruhlmann is the 123-pound highweight 
and he will be ridden by Gary Stevens. Whittingham's other contestant is Lively 
One, who is partial to Del Mar. Alex Solis has the mount. The other starters 
are Stalwart Charger and Flying Continental.

GALANTER URGED TO OPPOSE GATEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The back-room deal revealed in your article (Times, Aug. 30) underscores 
several serious obstacles for residents who wish to maintain control of the 
development within their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Your article quotes that the developers are determined "to move ahead with 
their projects before the remaining traffic capacity in the Venice-Marina del 
Rey area is used up." What you failed to mention is, if indeed Los Angeles has 
determined that the traffic capacity of Lincoln Boulevard is not saturated, 
then how can they explain the slow bumper-to-bumper traffic on Lincoln and 
Washington boulevards that already exists? Why isn't the L.A. Times 
investigating the foolish methods of measuring traffic capacity? 
</P>
<P>
(Jerry) Snyder claims that Ruth Galanter knew nothing of his negotiations, yet 
he also claims that he has been working on the planned negotiations for weeks, 
with Galanter providing the framework of the settlement. Seemingly blinded by 
the double talk, your article states: "One important player was apparently not 
a party to the negotiations: Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. . . . 
" Obviously Ruth Galanter wants to have her cake and eat it too; hopefully her 
constituents will see through this web of deceit. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder maintains that he advised Melvin Simon to "try being a goddamn 
responsible developer." I would advise Melvin Simon and Jerome Snyder to follow 
that advice. The surrounding communities don't need or want a Marina Place or a 
Channel Gateway. There are plenty of shopping centers, theaters, restaurants 
and exclusive housing close by. And we certainly don't need low-cost housing 
with time limits. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and Simon are interested only in windfall profits, and as such have no 
concerns as to the impact their projects will have on the community. I would 
urge both Jerome Snyder and Melvin Simon to instead build low- and 
moderate-cost housing in perpetuity. If this isn't cost-effective, well too 
bad, the era of carpetbagging is over. Let's begin an era of responsible 
community planning. 
</P>
<P>
I would urge Ruth Galanter to withdraw her support of Channel Gateway. Despite 
Snyder's continuing assertion that the community supports Channel Gateway, I 
assure Councilwoman Galanter there are many people opposed to the Channel 
Gateway project.

WAXMAN DENIES REDISTRICTING PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your Aug. 26 edition you report that I would redistrict Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson's seat so as to turn it Republican. 
</P>
<P>
This contention is totally false. While I may or may not have some input, I 
most certainly will not use what ever influence I may have to destroy the 
career of a fellow Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Beilenson and I have been friends and colleagues for two decades. Had your 
reporter checked with me, he would have learned that I have no desire to bring 
about such a change.

DEVELOPERS' FIX DELIGHTS READER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I haven't ever enjoyed a newspaper article as much as I did this one. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Simon and Jerry Snyder . . . are caught in the middle of lawsuits 
instituted by Los Angeles and Culver City, two municipalities whose elected 
officials have been more than willing to sacrifice the quality of life of 
residents for campaign contributions from developers. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the Culver City officials receive no financial gain from the 
Snyder development, and Ruth Galanter receives no financial gain from the Simon 
development, these politicians, in order to keep their jobs, are trying to 
convince the voters that they have some concern for the damage overdevelopment 
is causing to their constituents by attempting to prevent those developments 
which are not actually located in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
This all puts Simon and Snyder in the position where the avarice of each 
developer greatly damages the other. Welcome to the world of greed and 
corruption, fellas! 
</P>
<P>
I guess maybe there is a God after all.

LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR SANTA MONICA ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica residents who intend to vote Nov. 6 might consider putting in a 
request now for the day off. It's going to take some time. 
</P>
<P>
Along with voters everywhere else in California, Santa Monica residents will be 
choosing a governor, lieutenant governor, controller, treasurer, secretary of 
state and insurance commissioner, and representatives in Congress, the state 
Assembly and state Senate. They will decide on 28 statewide ballot measures 
(Propositions 124 to 151) and three Los Angeles County propositions. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Santa Monica voters will be about half-finished, because the 
longest city ballot in recent memory includes the following: 
</P>
<P>
* City Council elections: nine candidates for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
* Rent Control Board elections: six candidates for three full-term seats, and a 
two-candidate contest to fill two years of an unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
* Board of Education elections (school district includes Malibu): six 
candidates for four seats. 
</P>
<P>
* Community college trustee elections: five candidates for four seats. 
</P>
<P>
* Municipal judge runoff election: two candidates for one seat. 
</P>

HER WORLD: ODD FACTS CAN SURFACE IN SHIPBOARD LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Which foreign country would you hit first if you traveled due east from New 
York City? 
</P>
<P>
If you traveled due west from Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
Which city is farther north: Mexico City or Honolulu? Rome or San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
Which is bigger: one Africa or two Antarcticas? 
</P>
<P>
This was part of the daily quiz that sent me to an atlas in the wood-paneled 
library aboard the Seabourn Pride. 
</P>
<P>
We were cruising off Norway at the time, wending among flat rock islands called 
skerries that are strewn along the coast like endless skipping stones. The 
mighty Sognefjord was behind us. The beauty of Geiranger lay ahead. Quiz 
answers were due in by tea. 
</P>
<P>
On any ship, on any sea, I have spent happy moments in the library. The quiet 
of the space is appealing, as well as the maps and resources. Libraries have 
proved a safe haven on cruises. I've never been sunburned there. 
</P>
<P>
At sea -- cut free from the duties of home and office -- there is time to read 
last year's best-selling novel, or one from the year before. There is time to 
dip into a Churchill biography . . . and put it back down without guilt. 
</P>
<P>
You can check out videos of all the Oscar-winning films you have missed. And on 
some ships -- including the laid-back sail-cruisers of the sleek Windstar fleet 
-- you can line up for X-rated shorts that you might not want to show inside 
your home. 
</P>
<P>
The library on the Greek ship Illiria was a warm and important gathering place 
when we cruised to the Antarctic Peninsula one Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists and birders would open large books with glossy pictures to settle 
arguments. A passenger from New Zealand spread out shells she had collected in 
the Falklands and began identifying their markings. 
</P>
<P>
The library was a retreat for artists with sketchpads. Its big-screen corner 
became a hangout for video camera buffs who could not wait to get home to see 
their penguin footage. 
</P>
<P>
On ships where cabins are small and workmanlike, a library offers a welcome 
change of space. 
</P>
<P>
My first love among shipboard libraries was the cozy nook just off the lounge 
on the former Lindblad Explorer, now operated by Society Expeditions. 
Furnishings were simple: a desk for typing notes, a sofa and a chair. 
</P>
<P>
The shelves held nature books that related to our voyage. Paperback copies of 
"The Malay Archipelago" -- a classic study written by Alfred Russel Wallace in 
1869 and still the best source on the area -- were well-thumbed by the time we 
had sailed from Bali to the Asmat coast of New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
Since its launching in the 1970s, the Royal Viking Line has been generous with 
libraries that are rich with rosewood and brass appointments. I recall an 
afternoon on the Royal Viking Sea when I paused to reread the endings of four 
Agatha Christie mysteries so that my tablemates would stop quibbling over the 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
And on board the mighty Royal Princess -- on the day before a transit of the 
Panama Canal -- I finished reading a library copy of David McCullough's 
historic tale: "The Path Between the Seas." 
</P>
<P>
I always go cruising with some books from home in case what I want is checked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took an atlas to confirm that Portugal is the first foreign country 
due east of New York City; the Soviet Union the first due west of Seattle. And 
that Honolulu is north of Mexico City, and Rome is north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
I was pretty sure that one Africa was bigger than two Antarcticas, but without 
the library on the Seabourn Pride I would not have known that Africa covers 
11,696,000 square miles; two Antarcticas would be 11,000,000.

SHORT CRUISES OUT OF L.A. HARBOR CAN HELP TRAVEL DOLLAR GO FURTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's no news that consumers are cutting back on spending. All of us, it seems, 
have less discretionary income these days, and we're becoming more cautious 
about parting with our money. 
</P>
<P>
What is a revelation is that vacations are one thing that people are not giving 
up, at least according to such statistical soothsayers as the U.S. Travel Data 
Center, Travel Industry Assn. of America, Travel Industry Indicators and Cruise 
Lines International. 
</P>
<P>
Their consensus is that while vacationers might have become more frugal -- 
going from luxury to economy, for instance -- or might have cut down on the 
duration of their holidays, vacations remain at the top of people's "must-do" 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Escape has almost become a necessity. More than ever, there's a need to get 
away, to reduce stress by leaving home, work and responsibility behind, even if 
it is for just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend vacations climbed 28% between 1984 and 1989, and indications are that 
this year the figure will climb even higher. The trend toward quickie getaways 
may not only be due to cost-cutting effortsbut also to the time crunch faced by 
an ever-increasing number of two-income households with conflicting family 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Hottest on the list of those shopping for brief reprieves are short cruises. 
Last year, 85% of the more than 3 million Americans who took cruises sailed for 
seven days or less, with an increasing number on three- and four-day sailings, 
according to Cruise Lines International. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angelenos, short cruises are an even better bargain than for those 
living inland since air fares on fly-sail packages can be eliminated. If you're 
among the thousands who are focusing on value for a weekend high-seas getaway, 
here's a list of what's available locally (reservations may be made through 
most travel agents): 
</P>
<P>
Azure Seas: Built in 1955 and completely reconstructed in 1980, the 
756-passenger vessel sails every Monday and Friday through April 29 on three-

all cabins have at least two lower beds, and there is wall-to-wall carpeting,

a swimming pool, spa, disco, sport area, duty-free shop, video games, card

to the longer trip. The ship carries 752 passengers in 376 staterooms, all with 
twin and double beds; many cabins have folding upper berths to accommodate

remodeled in 1984 and the fall of 1989, the stately, Old World, 25,000-ton 
vessel has retained much of its wood paneling. It sails every Saturday from 
Sept. 29 through Nov. 3, and Nov. 17 through Jan. 6 on seven-day trips to Cabo 
San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. It has accommodations for 925 
passengers in 467 cabins, and offers wall-to-wall carpeting, air conditioning,

Saturday for seven nights to Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas. 
Rates: $745 to $2,045 per person, double occupancy. After a $75-million 
refurbishing that will add 260 cabins, boosting occupancy to 1,500, the ship 
will debut three- and four-night cruises on May 17, 1991, that will call at 
Catalina, Ensenada and San Diego. The remodeling will feature a new dramatic 
lounge surrounding the ship's funnel stack, 10 decks above the water line and a 
new dining room, plus expansion of the existing dining room, expansion of the 
casino, new indoor/outdoor cafe and gift-shop area, a nightclub with soda 
fountain for teens, disco and video arcade, a kids' center with bubbleball pool 
and facilities just for toddlers. Rates for the three-day cruises: $315 to 
$1,195 per person, double occupancy, and $345 to $1,300 for four-day sailings.

YOUTH BEAT: A HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO JOINING SHIP'S CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concept of free cruising throughout the world's waters as a member of a 
crew conjures up one of the ultimate romantic images for budget travelers. But 
just how realistic is this dream? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll discover that enjoying this type of adventure is based more on 
personality rather than gender, age or occupation," writes Alison Muir Bennett 
and Clare Davis in their recent book, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Oceans: 
Crewing Around the World." 
</P>
<P>
The British authors combined knowledge gained from their crewing experiences 
for a book designed to help others determine if the concept was something they 
would like, and, if so, how to go about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Topics include recognizing the skills that make you valuable to a skipper, how 
to acquire more skills, how to contact skippers who need crews, presenting 
yourself, what you should consider before signing on, the life style on board, 
and financial arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the authors write that just because you may not have had any 
"hands-on" experience crewing, don't think it means that you wouldn't be 
valuable. You may have other skills that would make you a desirable crew member 
-- skills such as cooking, teaching and navigation, plus knowledge of 
mechanics, languages and/or medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Even being able to play a musical instrument could help sway some skippers in 
your favor. 
</P>
<P>
You also get tips on the ways that "yachties" network, so you can plug into the 
system and make it known that you would like to sign on. For example, in some 
harbors, all the boats tune in to a daily radio session and exchange 
information, an ideal medium for a crew to make it known they are looking for 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
To use this method you have to go where the boats are docked. Each year the 
cruising boats migrate following patterns dictated by trade winds, hurricane 
seasons and other world weather conditions. The book includes a map and chart 
that indicates the bottleneck areas where skippers are most likely to be 
recruiting crews while waiting out the weather. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more valuable points offered is that you can't just expect to fly 
into any area with a minimum amount of funds, find a berth and be on your way. 
</P>
<P>
Without the proper documentation and references from a waiting skipper, you may 
have problems entering the country unless you can prove that you have the funds 
or a ticket that would take you home. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also learn that some island nations require each member of the crew, and 
the skipper, to post a bond equal to the amount of their air fare home, which 
is held until their day of departure. 
</P>
<P>
The authors encourage readers to consider some of the drawbacks to crewing, 
such as: adjusting to the time patterns required for a crew to man a boat 24 
hours a day, dealing with seasickness, living in cramped quarters, the 
complications of communicating with friends and family by phone or mail, 
washing in saltwater and learning to live in a less-than-democratic environment 
(the skipper's word is final). 
</P>
<P>
The book also points out the ways you can judge which skippers would be best 
suitable to sail with. You'll learn that it's important to pay attention to 
their reasons for making the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Are they escaping, relaxing or trying to achieve something? This can make a big 
difference in the type of atmosphere you can expect on board. 
</P>
<P>
You should also take into consideration that some vessels could be involved in 
illegal activities. The book suggests some ways for checking out your skipper, 
an important concern considering that even recreational drugs can lead to the 
confiscation of a boat and the arrest and sentencing of the crew. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the world, the sentencing of foreigners for drug offenses has 
even included the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Oceans: Crewing Around the World" is distributed 
by Tab Books, 13311 Monterey Ave., Blueridge Summit, Pa. 17214, (717) 794-2191.

Freebies: Free for the asking, "World of Cruising" is a listing of fall cruise 
specials offered by Cruise Line Inc., a Miami-based discount cruise and 
information center. Among the bargain listings are cruise lines offering 50% 
off for the second passenger on selected cruises. Call (800) 777-0707.

giveaway from the Ship Ahoy Cruise Club. The booklet contains the ins and outs 
of cruising, plus a detailed cruise guide for honeymooners, active adults and 
children. Call (800) 446-4943. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Singles: Ships with the largest number of single staterooms, according 
to Consumer Reports, include the Canberra (148), QE2 (98), Crown Del Mar (88), 
Dawn Princess and Fair Princess (59), Sagafjord (54), Rotterdam (42), Royal 
Viking Sea and Royal Viking Sky (both 39) and Vistafjord (36). Loners will 
still pay more than per-person rates sharing a double cabin, but not as much as 
they'd pay for occupying a double stateroom alone. 
</P>
<P>
Half-price Sail: Princess Cruises is offering Southern Californians a special 
"Second Person at 50% Off" rate for a transcanal cruise this fall aboard the 
Island Princess. The 11-day cruise sails from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to 
Acapulco, departing Oct. 16. During the voyage, the ship will visit St. Thomas, 
St. Maarten, Martinique and Curacao, and transit the Panama Canal. Fares begin 
at $2,140 per person, double occupancy; the 50% second-person discount is based 
on one-half of the tariff for the category. Round-trip air transportation 
connected with the ship is included from several Southern California gateway 
cities, including Los Angeles and San Diego. See your travel agent or call 
(800) 421-0522. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise to Eclipse: It's not too early to start planning a Hawaiian cruise to 
view the solar eclipse next year. American Hawaii's Independence and 
Constitution sail July 6, 1991, for seven-day voyages from Honolulu. The 
cruises will include the usual ports of Kauai, Kona, Hilo and Maui, but will 
reroute on July 11 off the Big Island. The total eclipse is due at 7:28 a.m. 
and will last more than four minutes, but passengers will be able to witness 
unusual lighting in the sky for up to two hours. Cruisers are invited to bring 
the kids, who can cruise free with certain types of accommodations. For 
details, see your travel agent or call (800) 765-7000. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise Hotline: A 24-hour Cruise Shoppers Hotline has weekly updates from 
around the country on where to locate discounted cruises, cruise line special 
offers, last-minute specials and special-interest group cruise sailing dates. 
For $2 a minute, callers can hear current information on such destinations as 
the Caribbean, Mexican Riviera, Alaska, Hawaii and Europe. Have a pencil ready 
and be prepared to quickly jot down money-saving information, telephone numbers 
and prices that will come at you rapidly. Call (900) 740-3400. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise Savings: South Florida Cruises, based in Ft. Lauderdale, offers savings 
from as little as $300 to $1,500 per cabin, based on double occupancy and 
availability. The company allocates millions of dollars annually to buy group 
space in advance on 23 different cruise lines. "This allows us to offer our 
customers the group rate, whether they want one or 101 or more cabins," says 
firm president Jim Bone. "The more cabins we buy, the easier it becomes to pass 
the savings on to our customers." Founded in 1985, the national company, with 
more than 30,000 past passengers, is a member of the Association of Retail 
Travel Agencies, Cruise Lines International Assn. and the National Assn. of 
Cruise Only Agencies. Call (800) 327-7447. 
</P>
<P>
Weather or No: To those potential cruisers concerned about hurricanes, the 
season officially begins in June and ends in November. Historically, most 
storms occur in August, September and October. But while there is some risk 
that a hurricane may occur on the week you've chosen to cruise, modern weather 
tracking systems virtually eliminate the danger of being caught in one.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: HIGH-QUALITY BARGAINS ABOUND IN CARIBBEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caribbean bargain-hunting is so good that many vacationers design 
island-hopping itineraries around shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on liquor, perfume, sweaters, woolens, famous-maker clothing, 
accessories, jewelry, china, crystal, linens and other labelled merchandise are 
similar throughout the islands, about 20% to 30% below U.S. mainland retail. 
Basic differences have to do with ambience and U.S. Customs regulations. 
</P>
<P>
There is no dollar limit on merchandise that may be brought home duty-free from 
Puerto Rico. Imports from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa are 
duty-free up to $1,200. From foreign Caribbean countries, $600 worth of goods 
may be imported duty-free, if citizens have been abroad at least 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
For greatest savings, know the prices at home and on board ship before island 
shopping. Principal shopping areas are usually near piers, and many ships 
provide shopping brochures, bulletins and/or maps for their ports of call. 
</P>
<P>
Except in Puerto Rico, liquor and perfumes are cheaper if bought in-bond (for 
export only) and delivered to your ship. Most shops deliver free of charge 
before your departure. 
</P>
<P>
When choosing your cruising-for-bargains itinerary, these top shopping ports 
deserve special consideration: 
</P>
<P>
San Juan, Puerto Rico -- La Plazoleta del Puerto, a crafts market opposite the 
piers, has stalls of folk art by local potters, needle workers and doll makers. 
</P>
<P>
On nearby Calle Fortaleza, Barrachina Center (No. 104) has small but noticeable 
diamond rings for under $120. Ole's (No. 105) handcrafts include Ecuadorian 
basketry, Chilean silver and Puerto Rican santos. The Butterfly People's (No. 
152) Lucite-encased arrangements of multicolored butterflies are $20 and up. 
Puerto Rican Arts &amp; Crafts (No. 204) has pottery, woodcarvings, textiles 
jewelry and papier-mache masks, plus paintings and prints by Puerto Rican 
artists. Bared &amp; Sons (No. 264) has designer crystal and china, watches and 
jewelry, but know the U.S. prices to assure yourself that their claim of 50% 
discounts is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
On Calle Cristo, Casa Cavanagh (No. 202) sells English, French and Italian 
crystal and china at about 30% discount. Don Roberto's (No. 205) offers 
Colombian leather goods, costume jewelry and gift items, plus antique Puerto 
Rican santos (wooden carvings pertaining to saints) and ceramics at fair but 
not cheap prices. Galeria Botello (No. 208), in the former home of artist Angel 
Botello, exhibits works by top Puerto Rican artists, plus antique santos. 
</P>
<P>
Factory outlets are found on Calle Cristo: Hathaway (No. 203) has Christian 
Dior, Ralph Lauren, Chaps and other big-name labels for up to 50% off list. 
Ralph Lauren Polo (No. 205) offers men's, women's and boys' clothes at 25% off 
list price for first quality or up to 50% off list for irregulars. Spend $300 
or more and they'll ship purchases home for free. 
</P>
<P>

T-shirts and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, on Main Street, Little Switzerland has three outlets with name-brand

both well-stocked general stores, issue discount cards (obtainable from cruise 
directors at airports or by writing to the stores with the date that you'll be 
in port) for 10% off on all merchandise, including already low-priced liquor 
and special sale items. Sparky's sells discounted cameras, but before buying 
compare prices at the Royal Caribbean shop on Main Street. It has a bigger 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
At A.H. Riise, designer labels include Bing &amp; Grondahl and Wedgwood 
porcelain, A.C. Bang furs, Liberty of London scarves and ties, and ilias 
LALAoUNIS jewelry, all 25% to 30% less than mainland retail prices. A.H. Riise 
Gift Shop Alley has less expensive gift and souvenir items, plus many small 
shops with a wide variety of goods. Don't miss Lion in the Sun, a terrific 
big-name boutique with discounts on attire by Yves Saint Laurent, Sonia Rykiel,

hard-to-resist prices) and The Jewelry Vault (styles similar to H. Stern at 
lower prices). 
</P>
<P>
In Palm Passage, an exclusive esplanade, chic boutiques sell Laroche, 
Courreges, Feraud, Mondi and other top labels at island prices. Island styles 
are sold at Java Wraps, a great source for batik fashions and fabrics. Mr.

NO GUARANTEES SHIPS' DOCTORS ARE WELL-TRAINED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THERE IS NO LAW, INTERNATIONAL OR AMERICAN, THAT GOVERNS MEDICAL CARE 
FOR PASSENGERS AT SEA. THIS LOOPHOLE ALLOWS SOME LINES TO GET BY WITH COVERAGE 
THAT IS FAR LESS THAN SATISFACTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY NELSON, Nelson is a former Times medical writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public and private agencies are beginning to look more closely at the adequacy 
of medical services aboard cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers may be surprised to learn that there is no international or U.S. law 
requiring minimum standards of medical care for cruise passengers. In fact, no 
law even requires that there be a doctor aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Although all large cruise ships do provide some kind of medical service -- some 
good, some poor -- this absence of standards has allowed a few companies in the 
highly competitive market to get by with far less coverage than satisfies U.S. 
maritime medical experts. This in spite of the fact that 81 of approximately 
100 of the world's large passenger liners regularly sail from U.S. ports such 
as Miami, Los Angeles and Seattle with mostly American passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of those ships are owned by U.S. companies, all but one of them 
operate under foreign flags. Together, they carry some 4 million passengers 
from U.S. ports to the Caribbean, Mexico and other exotic settings each year. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned by instances of sloppy safety and reports of non-credentialed or 
inadequately trained doctors, broken medical equipment, sick passengers 
abandoned on islands and questionable medical care, various agencies and groups 
are demanding tighter controls on ships leaving from U.S. ports, even those of 
foreign registry. While some lines provide adequate medical care, stories 
abound of the shortcomings on cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
On one ship out of Miami, according to a Ft. Lauderdale newspaper which 
investigated the problem, a doctor was irritated by having to see a patient 
with chest pains and delayed a consultation until he had dressed in full 
uniform. The patient died, and the family is suing the cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
The same Florida paper found a "doctor" on one ship who had no license from any 
country in the world. His only medical experience was taking blood in a blood 
bank. Another doctor who allegedly gave questionable care, according to court 
testimony, had previously been fired by the Veterans Administration for the 
same offense. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Merson, a Baltimore resident who runs a medical 911 emergency service for 
ships at sea, said he recently studied the physician accreditation, 
record-keeping, equipment maintenance and drug controls on 12 cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I found doctors who are not allowed to practice in the United States. Some are 
involved in diploma-mill scandals and some can't speak good English," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, they had no concept of emergency medicine. Typically they are reluctant 
to tell the captain about a problem or to call shore for help." 
</P>
<P>
On one ship, the cardiac defibrillator -- a device used to restart a stopped 
heart -- had been broken for five years. Merson said the medical staff did not 
know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he called their medical 
records "abysmal." 
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by Merson cited Cunard, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal 
Caribbean Cruise Line and Holland America as lines that provide good medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter's phone call to the New York-based Cruise Lines International Assn. 
asking for its policy regarding the qualifications of shipboard medical 
officers revealed that the association deals only with marketing and consumer 
education. A spokesman said medical policies are determined on a "line-by-line" 
basis. The association represents 36 companies. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to two lines that sail to Alaska and Latin America out of West Coast 
ports provides contrasting impressions. In Los Angeles, a Princess Cruises 
public relations woman said she would have to fax a reporter's questions to 
London, where medical affairs are handled. One week later the reporter still 
had not received a reply. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Sue Averill, manager of the medical department at Holland America, 
said the public "should check the quality of medical care on ships" they plan 
to take. She said her company provides a doctor and three registered nurses -- 
all trained in emergency medicine and available 24 hours a day -- on board each 
of its ships. 
</P>
<P>
The infirmary has cardiac monitors, a defibrillator and X-ray equipment, and is 
able to fax electrocardiograms to shore. There is no operating room. She said 
medical air evacuations have been arranged often to ports along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"If we feel the care at a nearby port is substandard, we keep them on the 
ship," Averill said. "When we're out in the toolies, we do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Averill said passengers who travel internationally should have travel insurance 
-- available for less than $100 a week -- that pays up to $20,000 for 
evacuation from nearly any part of the world. Most health insurance, including 
Medicare, will not cover such service, she said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard officials in Long Beach said that they do annual inspections 
on cruise vessels to insure compliance with international safety regulations. 
One officer said "spot checks" on cleanliness are made of the infirmary and 
galley, but that they have no authority to inspect for medical quality. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation aboard ships is the responsibility of a branch of the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control, which inspects each ship twice a year. Within the past 
year there have been five or six major food-poisoning incidents, involving 10% 
to 40% of the passengers. All occurred on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to learn the sanitation record of a U.S.-based ship you plan to 
board, you can obtain a copy of the latest inspection report by writing the 
Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control, Vessel Sanitation Program, 
1015 N. America Way, Room 107, Miami, Fla. 33132. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board asked Congress for 
legislation that would enhance passenger safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers should know that when they cross the gangplank, they are on their 
own," said Alan Pollock, an NTSB spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign-flag ships currently do not have to meet the same levels of safety 
that U.S. authorities demand. Also, they should understand that the NTSB can't 
investigate an accident outside U.S. waters unless the owner approves."

UPGRADES: WHILE TRAVELING, THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO OBTAIN A BETTER SEAT, ROOM OR

<P>
Getting upgrades to better airline seats, hotel rooms, ship cabins and rental 
cars can be a tricky business, and travelers often have misconceptions about 
their chances. 
</P>
<P>
Upgrades can come through a variety of ways -- various frequent traveler or 
corporate programs, use of promotional coupons, overbooking situations and 
problems with the room/cabin such as plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, upgrades are complimentary. Often, however, travelers are asked 
to pay the difference. And in some cases with hotels and car rental companies, 
simply asking for an upgrade may produce surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
One example of a misconception stems from the mistaken belief that if a 
traveler is in an overbooked situation on a cruise, he or she will wind up with 
a more expensive cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"There's usually some upgrading on every one of our cruises as we complete the 
berthing process," said Diane Moore, vice president of reservations for San 
Francisco-based Royal Cruise Line. 
</P>
<P>
"If a cabin category is oversold, we offer complimentary upgrades, but these 
better staterooms may go to other passengers who have sailed with us before or 
booked very early. Overbooked passengers then would get the same type of cabin 
they purchased." 
</P>
<P>
Another misconception comes when passengers decide that the original cabin they 
bought isn't for them, pay for an upgrade and then decide that their new 
stateroom isn't the improvement they expected. 
</P>
<P>
"We contact their travel agent to make sure the passengers know what they will 
get, since passengers tend to think the upgraded cabin will always be better in 
every way and on the same location on the same deck," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, a passenger has an inside cabin on a higher deck and gets 
upgraded to an outside cabin but on a lower deck. Or a passenger could go from 
an inside cabin on a lower deck but midship, to an outside cabin on a higher 
deck but more forward." 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks before sailing, lines may also try to sell unsold higher-priced 
cabins at a discount to already-booked passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"On our Crown Odyssey, for example, we might sell 10 or 15 cabins in this type 
of category per cruise out of a total of 60 to 70 cabins," Moore said. "It 
depends on the ship and the specific sailing. We contact passengers in the 
next-lowest cabin category and offer them a special rate." 
</P>
<P>
Repeat passengers and early bookers might get the first crack since the offers 
are made on a selective basis, Moore said. Once you're aboard ship, paid-for 
upgrades depend on availability of cabins. However, you would pay the exact 
difference between the cabin rates, Moore explained. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines can provide upgrades, but this is generally done just prior to the 
flight. "We have a stand-by upgrade list by which you can be upgraded if a seat 
is available in first class," said Agnes Huff, a spokeswoman for USAir. 
However, you pay the difference between the classes of service. 
</P>
<P>
Upgrades can also come about through frequent flier programs and various 
airline promotions, such as with financial institutions and supermarket chains. 
Another possibility for an upgrade can come from the station manager at an 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Station managers have the authority to upgrade someone if there has been a 
significant amount of inconvenience to a passenger," Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
If you think your situation warrants an upgrade, broach the subject to one of 
the carrier's agents. 
</P>
<P>
Some tour operators may offer consumers upgrades on the air portions of their 
packages. New York-based Perillo Tours is an example. The tour operator offers 
10-night packages from Los Angeles to Hawaii starting at $2,199 per person, 
double occupancy, and including round-trip economy-class flights as well as 
accommodations, meals and a helicopter tour. 
</P>
<P>
However, consumers can obtain an upgrade to first class for $659. The flights 
are on American Airlines. American's current regular LAX-Honolulu round-trip 
economy fare (without any restrictions) is $1,018. First-class fare will set 
you back $1,716. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, people on package tours also seek upgrades of their hotel rooms. 
"Sometimes people in Hawaii may decide they want an ocean-view room after 
seeing the room they have," said Steve Perillo, vice president of Perillo 
Tours. 
</P>
<P>
In such cases, if space is available, the traveler is likely to pay the 
difference between the room rates. However, there is still a savings since 
travelers would pay the tour operator's rate -- wholesale rather than retail. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels will generally upgrade guests on a complimentary basis if rooms in the 
category booked aren't available. If it was just a matter of seeking a better 
room, travelers would probably have to pay the difference. 
</P>
<P>
However, chances of getting an upgrade at no extra cost can still come about, 
depending on the hour of day and the policy of the property. If a guest is 
checking in fairly late in the day, some hotels might be more willing to 
negotiate and not risk the possibility of losing any revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no harm in asking," said Tony DiRaimondo, vice president of sales for 
L'Ermitage Hotels. "But people think upgrades can happen easier than they do." 
</P>
<P>
Repeat guests, of course, have a better chance of being upgraded. Indicate if 
you have stayed at the hotel previously. 
</P>
<P>
Car rental companies also offer upgrades. Consumers can request an upgrade at 
the time of the reservation, and a note will be made on the booking order. 
</P>
<P>
"The best time to ask for an upgrade is at the counter," advised Brian Baker, a 
spokesman for Dollar Rent A Car. Baker added that it's sometimes possible to 
get an upgrade at no extra cost.

<P>
The great thing about sailing is that after awhile, the earth moves. 
</P>
<P>
Or seems to, anyway, every time you come ashore and try to stand still on it. 
Sailors have a phrase for this. It's called getting your "sea legs." Sailors 
have a phrase for every damn thing. 
</P>
<P>
I was pretty sure, until five of us chartered a bareboat for a nine-day sail 
around the Virgin Islands in the spring of 1989, that "sea legs" was what 
Safeway calls those red-tinged, extruded-whitefish things impersonating crab 
meat in the seafood bin. 
</P>
<P>
Now I can safely say that my concept of seafood is forever changed by having 
lived among it -- with the attendant ever-present risk of becoming part of the 
food chain -- for a week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
It was exhilarating, yes. It was gorgeous, yes. It was sailing the deep-aqua 
seas and famed trade winds of the Caribbean. Need I say more? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that Michael, Ed, Megan, Lynn and I had a definite vacation aboard 
the aptly named Nirvana -- in the sense that for nine days we all very 
definitely vacated the premises and preoccupations of our workaday lives, in 
the process taking roughly 200 pictures apiece and layering on a combined total 
Sun Protection Factor of approximately 950. 
</P>
<P>
But a couple of us also got a definite education, and relearning "sea legs" is 
nothing compared to the thrill of comprehending compass headings or chart 
markings upon which your hull depends for its continued watertight state; or 
staying up all night when the wind is blowing you toward a rocky shore and your 
anchor won't hold; or fathoming that if you let the wind cross behind the 
mainsail on your current course, the boom will switch sides with enough force 
to tear off most of the deck, not to mention any friends of yours who might be 
on it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe these seafaring types just don't want you to forget that everyday 
necessities -- like sleep or shelter in a storm, or mixed drinks that don't 
fling themselves into your lap -- are not to be taken for granted when you're 
hitched to a couple of ancient and almighty forces like wind and sea. Maybe 
that's why sailors have a different word for everything: to keep outlanders on 
their toes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, on a boat like the 35-foot O'Day we chartered out of Charlotte Amalie, 
St. Thomas, everything is tied to everything else, right? But are there any 
ropes on this boat? Hah. 
</P>
<P>
"Just lines . . . and sheets," as Ed said knowingly on one of the first days 
out. He was bent over the winch on the port side of the companionway checking 
the halyard at the time. I remember because we were on a beam reach and I was 
trimming the jib sheets as the captain was shouting, "Helm's a-lee!" Got all 
that? 
</P>
<P>
I didn't, but I do now. I was probably the least experienced sailor aboard; I'd 
logged a few hours on the six-foot sunfish of my lakefront youth, numerous 
water skiing-inclined powerboats and a couple of Cape May-Lewes ferries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, our captain, sails every chance he gets, mostly on Chesapeake Bay, 
where he keeps his 25-footer in the water year-round. A Maryland state 
mental-retardation consultant during the work week, Michael dreams of someday 
living aboard his own boat, making an annual summer sail up the coast to Maine 
before heading back home -- to the Virgin Islands or thereabouts -- for the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Masking his intense passion for sailing's finer points behind a wry smile, an 
occasionally lit pipe and an always-calm demeanor, Michael is a real sailor. 
Ed, a writer in real life, could easily be a real sailor, too . . . if he had a 
boat. In any case, for the rest of us -- two more writers and a folk singer -- 
real sailors were a good thing to have around. I mean aboard. 
</P>
<P>
We spent the first few hours in Charlotte Amalie harbor getting to know the 
boat. This meant, for Michael and Ed, learning the diesel engine's 
peculiarities, where the lines and tools and winch handles were stowed, how the 
radio and instruments worked, and how the craft sailed on various tacks and 
under differing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us got to know other sailing essentials. While Michael and Ed got 
the official briefing from the barefoot, beer-bellied, sunbaked charter 
agent-mechanic, Lynn and I learned how to make 12 bags of groceries disappear 
into half a dozen tiny cabinets and two small top-loading refrigerator 
compartments. 
</P>
<P>
And Megan learned how to make pina coladas with the canned pineapple chunks she 
inexplicably bought instead of pineapple juice. And since few boats this size 
have blenders, much less AC current, for the duration of the trip we chewed our 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
We got used to it. 
</P>
<P>
On the water for nine days, actually, you get used to a lot of things. You get 
used to standing, walking, eating, napping and even pouring boiling water into 
a drip coffee basket while the floor beneath you is pitched at about 30 
degrees. You get used to damp clothes -- and soggy shoes, sheets, towels, 
potato chips, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
You get used to the smell in the "head" (that's sailor talk for "astonishingly 
small bathroom that doubles as an exercise room because you have to pump the 
toilet by hand"), and the smell in the refrigerator compartment that persisted 
for days after an early accidental frozen-fish thaw. 
</P>
<P>
You get used to it -- you even grow fond of most of it -- with good reason: 
When you go to sleep, gently rocking in a surprisingly comfortable berth that a 
moment ago was a booth for a party of five; when you wake up at sunrise or just 
before, rested and (unless you chewed one too many the night before) refreshed; 
when you're plotting a course made at once easier and more exciting by a wind 
that always blows -- strongly -- from the same compass point, the reason 
becomes as clear as the water beneath you: You're in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, you can go anywhere or do anything you like. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost anything. If you're with Megan you almost have to go snorkeling 
every 10 minutes, the ultimate goal being snorkeling the sublime (and, as it 
turned out, slippery) Caves of Norman Island. And if you're with Michael and Ed 
-- well, they tend to steer most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Actually I steered (OK, OK, I "took the helm") for a while on the third day, 
when we headed north from the waters between U.S. territories St. Thomas and 
St. John to the small, barely populated British Virgin island of Jost Van Dyke. 
</P>
<P>
The charts said we were to clear British Customs at a grand-sounding place 
called Great Harbour. The first thing we saw, after we dropped the sails and 
were motoring into a small bay lined with multicolored shacks, was a goat 
wandering the narrow beach. In the Virgin Islands, you learn quickly, the local 
definition of "great" is not the same as, say, the San Diego version. And you 
get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the tiny customs office, which was about to close for the day at 4 p.m., 
was a not-so-tiny line of other mostly pleasure-craft captains and crews, whose 
papers were being processed by two white-uniformed officers, one of whom kept 
cheerfully but ominously warning that he'd be quitting for the day any minute. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a decidedly less fettered side of British hospitality that night among 
the rowdy pleasure-boat crowd at a little restaurant/night spot called Sydney's 
Peace &amp; Love, up the coast a bit in Little Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney's, which is more or less a covered patio right on the beach, was covered 
this night with a capacity crowd that included a dozen loud and lubricated 
young Canadian guys, the apparently hard-working crew of the huge 75-foot-plus 
yacht we'd passed on the way in. 
</P>
<P>
By the time we arrived, their party had logged 45 drinks in the book at the 
self-service bar. By the time we'd finished our Caribbean lobsters and logged a 
few ourselves, one of them had fallen asleep in his dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney's did not constitute the typical night for the serious sailors of the 
Nirvana, however. About half the time we did eat out -- which usually meant 
dinghying in from our mooring or anchorage in a safe harbor (in the Virgin 
Islands, reefs and rocks make night sailing a perilous pastime to all but those 
intimately familiar with the channels) and dinghying back for an aperitif, some 
star-gazing and amateur philosophizing and, possibly, again depending on one's 
share of pineapple chunks, a skinny-dip or two. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time we cooked aboard the boat -- there was a barbecue grill 
that clamped to the stern rail -- cleaned up, sat around and fell asleep early. 
</P>
<P>
As the days passed, a routine developed. It mostly involved getting used to the 
all-but-routine things that happen when you're living on top of an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
First one up in the morning made coffee, supposedly. Unfortunately, the first 
ones up were usually Michael and Ed, which meant that the third one up (not 
Lynn, not Megan) had to make coffee during a close haul, which is sailing 
terminology for cutting across the wind on a specific angle that causes the 
boat to heel sharply and the hot water to miss the filter basket. 
</P>
<P>
We spent one afternoon snorkeling and exploring at Green Cay, a truly tiny 
unpopulated island east of Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgins that we dubbed 
Gilligan's Island -- until an unwanted rescue party (actually another boat full 
of tourists with better snorkeling equipment) showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The morning that we sailed out -- about two hours had passed under sail -- 
Michael turned to us from the swim platform on the stern, where he had been 
standing for some minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said calmly, cheerfully. "Has anyone seen the dinghy lately?" 
</P>
<P>
We had been towing a dinghy. We looked back and saw what Michael had seen. Or 
not seen. 
</P>
<P>
We turned around and headed back. We searched. We got on the radio. We searched 
some more. When we were about to give up (this is a nautical term denoting the 
start of discussions about what the charter insurance does and does not cover), 
Lynn cocked her head toward the radio. Someone had seen a dinghy! They couldn't 
pick it up for us -- they were a "vessel under sail," as the real sailor on the 
radio put it -- but they told us where they'd seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Though I was assigned the "bow watch" -- I wedged myself between the bow rail 
and the jib as we crashed through a choppy, deep channel and pretended I could 
see something besides blue blur when I looked through the binoculars -- Megan 
spotted the dinghy from the stern. We were saved. (About $500, we reckoned.) 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the trip, after a luxurious mooring at the Bitter End Yacht 
Club on Virgin Gorda, we visited Virgin Gorda's much-touted Baths -- giant 
rocks and formations tossed into a series of caves with warm, swirling pools of 
water inside. 
</P>
<P>
What the guidebook didn't mention were the giant tourist and vendor formations, 
or the dangerous swell along the tiny, not-quite-rock-free stretch of beach 
where we attempted to land the dinghy. (Lynn was almost crushed by the dinghy 
after we jumped out and a large wave tossed the 500-pound fiberglass thing on 
top of her.) 
</P>
<P>
On the way out we bent the stock of our Danforth anchor, which was wedged under 
a rock, rendering it useless. Luckily, we had another -- a plow anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Unluckily, it was not the best anchor for the grass-covered bottom at Norman 
Island, our next stop. We reached the small harbor just at sunset, squeezed 
into one of the few remaining spaces in the harbor, anchored and dinghied in 
during a sudden squall (rain and wind to you and me) to the island's sole 
restaurant in a permanently anchored boat called the William Thornton, for a 
nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
Rum costs less than drinking water in the Caribbean, they say. In any case, one 
thing led to too many others in the cramped bar of the William Thornton, and by 
the time we were all back in the Nirvana's cockpit/family room we were singing 
in French, acting silly and starting to yawn. It had been a particularly long 
day. 
</P>
<P>
About that time I noticed that we seemed to be closer to our neighbors than 
we'd been. There followed a healthy racket of denial. Then Michael got up, and 
Ed got up, and the rest of us got up, and we began checking our position 
against landmarks. We were drifting toward shore. It was midnight. We had to 
start the engine, pull up the anchor (that was my job, and there was no 
handy-dandy winch involved), keep watch off the bow (Michael) and relay 
directions (Lynn and Megan) to the helm (Ed) -- all this in the dark. We 
probably would've functioned more like a well-oiled machine had we not spent 
the last three hours getting so well-oiled. We got the anchor fixed a couple of 
days later at Cruz Bay, a nifty little village at the opposite end of St. John 
(most of which is a U.S. national park), and we hit Norman Island again on the 
way back to St. Thomas -- and snorkeled at the Caves. 
</P>
<P>
Some guys we had met at the William Thornton bar had passed on instructions to 
feed the fish bread crumbs while we snorkeled. Scores of multicolored fish swam 
right into Michael, Megan, Ed and Lynn while I kept anchor watch aboard 
Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a few minutes after the brave snorkelers departed, the anchor 
began to drag. Another boat was anchored 20 feet downwind, so I had to act 
quickly: I started the engine, sprinted up to the bow and hauled up the anchor, 
ran back to the cockpit and chugged off. 
</P>
<P>
When the snorkelers exited the Caves, there I was, puttering in a lazy circle, 
feeling satisfied -- proud, even -- for having done the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors have a word for this kind of serendipitous tumult, too, by the way. 
They call it "sailing."

MEN'S FALL FASHION; 
</P>
<P>
REVOLUTION IN COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
WHILE NEW women's styles regularly burst onto the fashion scene, swinging from 
neon miniskirts to leopard-look full-lengths in the blink of a season, men's 
fashions have a tendency to plod. Year after year, blues, dark greens, browns 
and grays pass down the runways in a predictable blur. Those moments when 
designers have taken a risk -- pink polo shirts, colorful ties, wild socks, 
sport shoes with suits -- are rarely earthshaking. 
</P>
<P>
Until this season. Get out your sunglasses and all your fashion courage, 
because there's a menswear revolution brewing. For fall, designers are offering 
patterns and ensembles that have one thing in common -- adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Start with color -- bold, mixable color. Shades of turquoise, purple, orange, 
red and yellow are guaranteed to turn even the most classically shaped jackets, 
suits, pants, sweaters and shirts into shocking and innovative fashion 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional stripes, florals and plaids are thrown about fearlessly, and the 
old rules of pattern mixing are forgotten, replaced with a sense of humor and 
experimentation. Painterly prints in broad color spectrums are the most modern 
choices, gracing shirts of velvet, silk, rayon and cotton knits. 
</P>
<P>
This revolution comes complete with that key fashion ingredient, accessories. A 
chain belt around an otherwise classic tuxedo makes a play on Chanel; an 
embellished vest glimmers beneath a traditional suit; fancy necklines offer 
quirky alternatives to ties; special buttons, textural trims and unique pocket 
treatments give jackets and pants that extra oomph. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not quite ready to take the plunge and restock your wardrobe, 
colorful ties, socks, belts, watches and glasses can offer a hint of audacity 
-- a bold start for a beginning sartorial risk taker. 
</P>
<P>
Many men will be delighted at the absence of rules; others will be terrified. 
And an unsuspecting few will find themselves suddenly on the cutting edge: The 
golfer in his bright green pants and orange shirt or the tourist in his 
flower-print shirts and plaid shorts just may have the most fashionable looks 
going.

MALIBU GETS EARLY START ON POLITICAL INFIGHTING; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CITY COUNCIL-ELECT IS ALREADY SHOWING DEEP DIVISIONS ON SEVERAL KEY 
ISSUES. MEMBERS HAVE NO POWER UNTIL SEASIDE COMMUNITY FORMALLY BECOMES A CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has no budget, no staff and little real power, but in the three months since 
Malibu voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood, the seaside community's 
unofficial City Council has done its best to substitute for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
In weekly sessions that last up to four hours, the five council members -- 
elected but unable to take office until the famous coastal enclave becomes a 
city -- wrestle with an array of problems for which there are few solutions. 
</P>
<P>
A homeowner wants to know when the landslide near his house will be cleaned up. 
Residents complain about traffic along Pacific Coast Highway. Self-appointed 
community watchdogs want a say in where City Hall will be located. 
</P>
<P>
The three men and two women listen dutifully, often argue among themselves, and 
frequently ask questions no one can answer. 
</P>
<P>
At their meetings, held in a stylish auditorium at Hughes Aircraft Co.'s 
research laboratories high in the Malibu hills -- which the company makes 
available free of charge -- the most common phrase one hears is "after we 
become a city." 
</P>
<P>
As standard-bearers for a community where movie stars and ordinary retirees 
have linked arms to throw off the mantle of Los Angeles County government, 
which wants to install an unpopular sewer system there, the council members 
have gone from relative obscurity to household names in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
With the county trying to delay incorporation until March in a bid to start 
work on the sewer before a new city government has the chance to block it, they 
are, in a sense, all dressed up with no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a government-in-waiting, if you will, and while we would obviously like 
to jump in there and take real action on behalf of the people who elected us, 
we're unable to do that," said Councilman-elect Mike Caggiano. "It's very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing the council has been able to do is fight for cityhood -- and in 
that effort it has earned high marks. 
</P>
<P>
After a state appeals court in July ruled that the county Board of Supervisors 
had the authority to delay incorporation until March, the council-elect turned 
to the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A measure that would nullify the supervisors' delay swept both houses of the 
Legislature without opposition two weeks ago. At the close of the legislative 
session Aug. 31, Gov. George Deukmejian had not acted on the bill. He has until 
Sept. 30 to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members have worked shoulder to shoulder against a county 
government that is about as popular in Malibu as a cloudy day at the beach, 
there are already signs of deep division on other matters. 
</P>
<P>
The differences reflect a rivalry between the two slow-growth groups that 
spawned the community leaders who won election to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wan, who finished second in the balloting, is the former president of the 
Malibu Township Council, the oldest residents' group in Malibu. Two other 
council members -- Caggiano and Missy Zeitsoff -- also came from its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Keller, the top vote-getter, and Carolyn Van Horn emerged from the 
Malibu Committee for Incorporation, which they co-chaired. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, there was a tacit agreement that the Township Council would 
take the lead in opposing the sewer, leaving the incorporation group in the 
forefront of the cityhood effort. 
</P>
<P>
A few months before the June election, however, the incorporation group's 
leaders accused the Township Council of plotting to invade their turf. Despite 
private assurances of cooperation before the election, the rivalry quickly 
asserted itself once the council-elect began to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, there was a bitter rift over the hiring of a city attorney. 
Keller and Van Horn favored Graham Ritchie, the incorporation group's lead 
attorney. The other council members settled on Michael Jenkins, who is city 
attorney for West Hollywood and a couple of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up involves the choice of Keller to receive the mostly 
honorary title of mayor-elect. 
</P>
<P>
Keller's supporters had insisted since June that, because he won the most 
votes, he should be mayor. They noted that the top vote-getter was named mayor 
in all but one of the last dozen cities to incorporate in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
When the matter was brought up at an early meeting of the council, the majority 
faction favored postponing a choice until after incorporation. Then, in a 
surprise move last week, Wan offered the motion to appoint Keller. 
</P>
<P>
In the excitement of the moment, Keller and some of his supporters apparently 
did not notice that the motion called for him to surrender the title in April. 
Keller said later that he thought the appointment would last until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
If the county gets its way in forcing the delay of cityhood until March, it 
means that the new mayor-elect may only be mayor for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Keller's partisans cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's somebody's idea of a fence-mending gesture, the fur is going to 
fly," said Van Horn, who, although she voted for the appointment, has since 
expressed misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
In their overall tone, the council sessions fall somewhere between a New 
England town hall meeting and a television talk show. Members of the audience 
sometimes shout opinions at the council, and at each other. 
</P>
<P>
There is not even a gavel yet to put the budding gadflies in their place. The 
council members dutifully make motions, second them and take votes. Of course, 
they do not have a dime to spend and cannot order anybody to do anything. So 
the votes are largely on ministerial matters, such as sending a letter to the 
California Coastal Commission on the scheduling of matters that could affect 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first venture into elective politics for each of the council 
members. Three hold doctorates: Wan, who owns a high-tech products company; 
Keller, a retired aerospace engineer, and Caggiano, a public policy analyst. 
The two others are retired schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides conflicts over the mayor and city attorney, their infighting has 
resulted in several stalemates. 
</P>
<P>
Although actor Michael Landon has donated office furniture, there is no place 
to put it because the council, after weeks of bickering, only last week settled 
on a future city hall. 
</P>
<P>
Similar disagreements have stalled efforts to hire a support staff. After much 
wrangling, the panel just agreed to begin contract talks with a prospective 
interim manager. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much distrust between the two factions you can almost reach out and 
touch it," said one community activist. "If this is a dress rehearsal, what 
will it be like when there really is a city?" 
</P>

CHABAD -- IT IRRITATES AND INSPIRES JEWS IN SOUTHLAND; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: DESPITE ITS HOMELESS SHELTER, DRUG PROGRAM AND OTHER GOOD WORKS, 
CONTROVERSY SHADOWS THE HASIDIC SECT. 
</P>

<P>
On the eve of its yearly telethon, Chabad of California finds itself busier 
than ever and, as usual, strapped for cash, according to Rabbi Boruch Shlomo 
Cunin, the sect's charismatic leader. 
</P>
<P>
But this year is different, because the Hasidic sect is enmeshed in a bitter 
squabble that focuses on a Jewish student housing co-op near UCLA and has riled 
many in the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has again drawn attention to Chabad's role among Los Angeles Jewry, 
where the black-coated rabbis of the mystical denomination have won support 
among many who have no other contact with organized religion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chabad's unabashed evangelical efforts have managed to 
irritate others who have viewpoints of their own, including some in the 
strictly observant Orthodox community. 
</P>
<P>
The latest development came Thursday, when a two-page ad in the Hollywood 
Reporter appealed to show business celebrities to boycott tonight's telethon on 
KCOP, held from 5 p.m. to midnight, when Chabad expects to raise more than $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it true that Chabad obtained title to three Jewish student living 
cooperatives, with an equity value of $2 million, by fraud and deceit?" asked 
the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
The ad was placed by a group called Friends of the Bayit (which means "house" 
in Hebrew), which wants the buildings returned to the board that previously ran 
them. It urged performers ranging from Bob Hope to Whoopi Goldberg to press 
Chabad to go to court to settle the dispute, which has dragged on since last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it took over the properties only 
after other Jewish groups declined to underwrite the housing projects in 
Westwood, Berkeley and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the previous board have scheduled a demonstration for 1 p.m. 
today outside Chabad headquarters in Westwood, but Cunin, Chabad's West Coast 
director, said that he still expects a successful telethon. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the dispute is a messy, complicated legal wrangle over real estate. 
That it has become a hot topic of conversation and debate among Los Angeles 
Jews attests to Chabad's ability to both inspire and irritate. 
</P>
<P>
The sect, which traces its beginning to the 18th Century, has spread like 
Bermuda grass since Cunin arrived in Los Angeles 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters praise Chabad's drug rehabilitation and homeless shelter, its 
outreach to uncommitted Jews and its school network that provides Jewish 
education in areas where there are few other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
And they rave about the leadership of the silver-bearded Cunin, a 49-year-old 
father of 13. 
</P>
<P>
Starting from the garage of his house in the Fairfax District, Cunin built a 
network of 42 synagogue centers, 12 social service facilities and 14 schools 
stretching from San Diego to San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
While no more than a few thousand Jews actually pray regularly at Chabad 
synagogues, about 10,000 pupils attend its Hebrew schools and youth programs, 
and thousands more have been touched through the telethon or personal 
encounters with Chabad emissaries, who often stop people on the street and urge 
them to say their daily prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Sympathizers and detractors alike attribute the success of Chabad in California 
to the charisma of Cunin. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you know him you kind of fall in love with the guy," said Howard Furst, 
owner of AAA Flag &amp; Banner Manufacturing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Furst met Cunin while trying to drum up business for his company. He now finds 
himself donating $30,000 worth of flags and banners to publicize the telethon, 
which last year featured appearances by a broad range of celebrities. Bob 
Dylan, for example, performed "Hava Nagila." 
</P>
<P>
The telethon, first aired in 1980 after a fire gutted the Chabad headquarters 
in an old fraternity house, raised $1.2 million the first year, increasing to 
$5.4 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Furst may be typical of the Jews who support Chabad without subscribing to its 
elaborate belief system, which is summed up in the three words whose initials 
make up the name Chabad -- wisdom, understanding, knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't join their temple because that's not the way I believe," Furst said. 
"It's too religious for me . . . (but) I got interested in the good things 
they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But others in the Jewish community say that Chabad is a maverick movement whose 
leaders would rather have little to do with the rest of the organized Jewish 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with Chabad is the perception not only that its way is the only 
way (to Judaism) but that Chabad is the only institution," said Rabbi Laura 
Geller, executive director of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American 
Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Geller's group has been tussling with Chabad for years over whether to place a 
Hanukkah menorah in City Hall, something that the Jewish Congress opposes as a 
mixing of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the Orthodox camp, where Chabad is among the strictest exponents of 
traditional Judaism, there are those who are disturbed by its zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad's emissaries want to convert the entire Jewish people to their point of 
view, said one rabbi, who declined to be identified. Sme Orthodox Jews do not 
like the idea that somebody has a corner on truth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad also has stirred up considerable controversy with its activities in 
Israel. Since 1970, it has been the driving force behind a campaign to change 
Israeli immigration laws so that only converts whose conversion was supervised 
by Orthodox rabbis would qualify for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative has been roundly denounced by Reform and Conservative Jews as an 
attack on their legitimacy in the United States, where they make up the bulk of 
the organized Jewish population. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy is nothing new to Chabad, a sect whose origins lie in the Hasidic 
revival movement that took Eastern European Jewry by storm at the end of the 
18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Hasidism's founder, an itinerant preacher known as the Baal Shem Tov (Master of 
the Good Name), taught the importance of mystical belief, urging Jews to 
emphasize sincere, joyous prayer and good deeds. 
</P>
<P>
His followers set up different schools, or courts. Chabad is also known as 
Lubavitch, after the town in Byelorussia that was its headquarters for a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad's current leader, Menahem Mendel Schneersohn, called the Lubavitcher 
Rebbe, was born in 1902 and came to the United States in 1940, where he oversaw 
from his Brooklyn headquarters the expansion of Chabad to dozens of cities in 
the United States and outposts overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Not the least of his emissaries was Cunin, who vividly remembers the day when, 
as a young rabbi in the 1960s, he received his mandate from Schneersohn: "Go -- 
California is yours." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago, however, Chabad of California was so deep in debt that we 
were "well over the edge," Cunin said in a recent interview, and Schneersohn 
criticized him in his internationally distributed weekly talks for "leaping too 
high." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Cunin recalled, "We owed $18 million to an assortment of 40 banks 
and 18 individuals -- and all of it (secured by) my beard." 
</P>
<P>
As Cunin knocked on the doors of mansions in Beverly Hills, following up old 
leads in the hopes of finding new contributions, he came upon a woman who later 
said their brief meeting had changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
Hermine J. Weinberg, who was then going through a divorce from her hotelier 
husband, William, sent Cunin a check for $1,000, but that was small compared to 
the provisions of her will -- a bequest of the bulk of her multimillion-dollar 
estate to Chabad. 
</P>
<P>
William Weinberg and their children, who were cut out of the will less than two 
days before Hermine Weinberg took her own life in 1985, contested the bequest 
but a settlement was reached in 1988 in which Chabad netted $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Weinberg miracle," Cunin calls it. 
</P>
<P>
In its 25th anniversary magazine, Chabad claims to have brought Judaism to 
rapidly growing cities like Lancaster, Palmdale, Upland and Fresno, "where 
there had been but a dim flicker." 
</P>
<P>
Some would take issue with that statement. "There has been a lot more than a 
glimmer of Judaism at this synagogue for the last 40 years," responded Rabbi 
Alan Henkin of Beth Knesset Bamidbar, a Reform synagogue in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Cunin says he has a mailing list of about 58,000 homes in Southern California, 
where his yearly telethon has made him one of the region's most widely 
recognized Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad's success is "an example of what L.A. can offer to people of an 
entrepreneurial way of thinking," said Max Vorspan, a historian of Los Angeles 
Jewry and vice president of the Conservative movement's University of Judaism 
on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rabbi Meyer May, executive director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center: "To 
the credit of Chabad, they recognized that they have a major responsibility for 
reaching out to unaffiliated Jews, and in this effort they are almost 
unparalleled. . . . Nobody has made as large a commitment as they have in L.A."

NEW RULING LIFTS VEIL OF SECRECY IN CIVIL CASES; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: CONTENDING PRIVATE ACCORDS WERE KEEPING 'DAMAGING INFORMATION' FROM 
THE PUBLIC, THE SAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF A NATIONWIDE 
MOVEMENT WITH ITS ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
When James and Patricia Miller went public with the news that the Ford Motor 
Co. was paying them $6 million to settle a lawsuit, their disclosure was the 
exception rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Ford had wanted to keep secret the terms of the agreement ending the 
$23-million suit -- which the Millers had brought in San Diego Superior Court 
over a car crash on a country road near Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers, who live in Carlsbad, had agreed to keep quiet -- but only if the 
company would notify its customers about what the family claims is a need to 
fit the rear seats of Ford autos with shoulder harnesses and lap belts, not 
just the belts. 
</P>
<P>
Ford declined, contending that a damage suit settlement was not the way it 
wanted to debate seat belt policy -- and so, last April, when the deal was 
done, the Millers told all about the $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The family's action marked a departure from the secrecy that increasingly has 
enveloped court cases fought over product and environmental hazards and over 
medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, however, it no longer is the exception to make public the details 
of civil settlements such as the one the Millers negotiated with Ford. It is, 
in fact, the rule. 
</P>
<P>
In a first for a California court, the San Diego Superior Court has enacted a 
rule that does away with secrecy agreements in most civil cases. It came about 
after the court's former presiding judge complained that secrecy agreements 
were being used to keep "damaging information" from other victims in all kinds 
of cases, but especially those involving hazardous products. 
</P>
<P>
The rule, which took effect July 1, goes well beyond settlements. It includes 
the other documents in the court file on the case and any exhibits, too. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rule, a court file can remain secret only after a three-part test 
proves that secrecy is "in the public interest," the material contains trade 
secrets or other privileged material and disclosure "would cause serious harm." 
Everything else remains open. 
</P>
<P>
The court's presiding judge, Judith McConnell, said the rule is likely to be 
controversial because it had become so common for lawyers, especially defense 
attorneys, to seek confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers had sought to keep secret information that could be damaging. But, just 
as routinely, they would seek to stifle material that was just plain 
embarrassing. Even they concede there were abuses. 
</P>
<P>
David E. Monahan, a San Diego lawyer, said it got to the point that "you would 
wind up with something about as confidential as a laundry ticket being marked, 
'Attorneys' Eyes Only.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, defense attorneys said, there can be legitimate reasons for secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
During a case, a corporation might have a genuine business reason for keeping 
material from a rival who is able to peek into the court file, said Wayne 
Boehle, a Santa Monica lawyer and president of the Assn. of Southern California 
Defense Counsel. 
</P>
<P>
And, when it's over, the company might not want to release the amount of a 
settlement for fear it will be inundated by thousands of other lawsuits, only 
some of which may have merit, Boehle said. Going to court, if only to file 
dismissal papers, takes time and money, and the public already is frustrated 
with clogged courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without further clarification and some indication as to how this (rule) is 
going to be utilized, I would hope it does not filter its way up into the Los 
Angeles court system," Boehle said. 
</P>
<P>
But, given the San Diego court's reputation for innovation -- it was the first 
court in California to experiment with a fast-track system that pushes civil 
cases to trial speedily, a plan that since has spread throughout the state -- 
McConnell said she suspects the rule may be copied. 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, the court's judges, who enacted the rule by themselves and 
without outside lobbying, are sure it's the right rule. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to use public courts, you have to be willing to expose 
yourself to public scrutiny," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment is the precise motivation behind a movement emerging around the 
nation to keep court files open to the public -- despite lawyers' efforts to 
the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, Texas passed a court rule and Florida enacted a law 
calling for open files. A similar rule is under consideration in New York. And 
a Virginia law that took effect in July, 1989, allows attorneys in separate but 
similar personal injury cases to share information. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Rhode Island, an open files law that passed the legislature earlier 
this summer was vetoed by Gov. Edward D. DiPrete after pressure by a lobbyist 
with ties to General Motors and by defense lawyers from around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules shift control over secrecy from partisan lawyers to impartial 
judges -- requiring the judges to grant secrecy only when it is justified under 
the rules or as a matter of law. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over secrecy signals that the legal system is "in the throes of 
completely changing the perception of a civil lawsuit," according to George 
Washington University law professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
With the government unwilling or unable to look at harm being caused by unsafe 
products or other dangers, lawsuits are replacing consumer protection agencies, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Cheh said tension always has been inherent in the 
court system, because the courts are publicly funded yet provide a forum for 
suits between private parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really thought about the implications of that until we realized that 
lawsuits sometimes were the only way to vindicate serious harms by large 
corporations or other aggregates of power," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers and government regulators might remain unaware of a safety hazard 
until it becomes the focus of a high-profile lawsuit, she said. The suit, and 
the public attention it sparks, then serves as the vehicle for change, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But lawsuits bring change, she said, only if the results reach consumers, who 
then can shun an offending product; manufacturers, who can opt to stop 
producing it; and the government, which can regulate the field. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Doggett, the author of the openness rule in 
that state, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of cases in which the general public health and safety is 
seriously undermined by secrecy," he said, because problems are handled case by 
case rather than as an overall problem affecting many people. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, a national organization 
that serves plaintiffs' lawyers, the use of secrecy practices in civil cases 
has jumped "steadily and significantly" since the mid-1970s. Specific figures 
on the number of cases kept secret are not available. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the secrecy process is initiated by defendants, judges and lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because, under the wide-ranging questions that both sides pursue under 
court authority in preparing for a trial, called "discovery," a plaintiff can 
demand all information that a defendant has about the cause and circumstance of 
an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Under a protective order, issued by a judge, a party to a suit is legally 
barred from distributing information received from the opposing side to others. 
In a 1987 manual produced for defense lawyers, the attorneys were urged to 
routinely seek protective orders in all complex products liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
Most civil cases are settled before a trial. Under a confidentiality agreement, 
a plaintiff promises, in return for a favorable settlement, to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
That paid-for secrecy is often too attractive to pass up for a plaintiff -- 
especially if the plaintiff is handicapped or elderly or has a fixed income -- 
or for a cash-strapped plaintiff's lawyer, who probably operates on a 
contingency fee. 
</P>
<P>
After commonly waiting two or three years since filing the suit, the choice 
then becomes to accept the immediate cash or "wait another year to go to trial 
and risk that they may not win," said Michael C. Maher, an Orlando, Fla., 
attorney and the current president of the trial lawyers' group. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't afford that risk. Literally." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the process, the public is denied vital truths on health, safety and 
the environment that could protect people from injuries and even death, 
plaintiffs' lawyers claim. 
</P>
<P>
According to the trial lawyers' group, secrecy has kept the public and 
regulators from learning about such hazards as automobile fuel systems that 
could ignite upon impact, exploding cigarette lighters, defective heart valves 
and chemical leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Miller settlement with Ford became public knowledge, it has generated 
intense press attention over the safety of lap-only rear seat restraints, said 
Craig McClellan, the family's San Diego lawyer. His office has collected an 
inch-thick collection of newspaper clippings on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stemmed from a 1988 head-on collision that killed one of James 
Miller's 11-year-old twin sons and left the other a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
Both boys were seated in the rear of the family's 1986 Ford Escort and were 
wearing lap belts. The parents, who were seated in the front, wore shoulder 
belts and escaped with bruises and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that, if we kept quiet about this that it wouldn't help anybody else 
in the future," said James Miller, 45, a pressman. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't matter how much money they offered," he said. "We weren't going to 
keep quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's San Diego lawyers declined to comment on the case or could not be 
reached. The company has denied any liability in connection with the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, meanwhile, claim that an avalanche of additional suits is not 
the sole product of widespread publicity about settlements. 
</P>
<P>
They said that widespread publicity about settlements can make it more 
difficult for any company to obtain a fair jury in a future case. And, they 
said, a settlement in one case may mistakenly indicate the value of claims in 
another case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, defense lawyers said, some plaintiffs' lawyers are too interested 
in publicity for themselves and distort the nature of cases and reasons for a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether it's the public's right to know or a special interest 
group wanting to be able to get information for litigation in subsequent cases, 
whether that's an overriding interest," said Edward D. Chapin, a San Diego 
defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael I. Greer, the former presiding judge of the San Diego Superior 
Court, said that the defense concerns have validity. But, he said, the San 
Diego rule came about at his urging after he "became acutely aware of the 
widespread abuse" of secrecy practices. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum he sent last December to the court's approximately 70 other 
judges, Greer said confidentiality agreements and protective orders were "being 
used to conceal damaging information from potential plaintiffs in a wide 
variety of cases." 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose I have a case against XYZ Products Co.," Greer said in an interview. 
"XYZ answers (questions in the case), but the court says those answers can be 
used only for this lawsuit and may not be passed onto other lawyers, just 
because XYZ contends they're trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got 200 other lawsuits against XYZ in the court. Are we going to go 
through that 200 times?" 
</P>
<P>
McConnell, the current presiding judge, said the new rule still allows for some 
secrecy. Tax returns in domestic cases, psychological evaluations in custody 
cases and cases that the law keeps confidential -- such as juvenile and 
adoption cases -- will remain secret, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule does not define when or how secrecy is "in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said judges' busy calendars might prove the ultimate flaw 
with the San Diego rule. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court is confronted with issuing an order permitting a confidential 
agreement or running some risk of not settling the case, I guarantee you the 
judge is going to issue the order permitting the agreement and settling the 
case," said Douglas M. Butz, president of the San Diego Defense Lawyers, a 
defense bar group. 
</P>
<P>
Michael I. Neil, a San Diego attorney and a past president of the Assn. of 
Southern California Defense Counsel, the nation's largest group of insurance 
defense lawyers with about 2,300 members, said he thinks the rule may be a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure that's in the best interest of the litigation process," he 
said. "Courts are inundated with suits right now. I think we ought to be doing 
everything we can to encourage settlements. If that proves to discourage 
settlements, it's not in the best interest in my opinion of the judicial system 
or taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Butz said, "I don't envision any massive uprising in response to this 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
Cheh, the law professor, said she could envision several ways for inventive 
lawyers to get around the rule. 
</P>
<P>
The case could be brought in any other county in California but San Diego, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Or settlements could be reached before the case ever makes it to the courthouse 
door, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Or, she said, a case could be taken out of the mainstream court system and into 
the increasingly popular rent-a-judge market, where the two sides agree to have 
it heard by a private judge. 
</P>
<P>
Or, since the whole point of having a settlement agreement signed by a judge is 
to make it enforceable as a court judgment, defense lawyers could simply insist 
that the judge never sign off on the deal -- a likely prospect if a check is 
presented with the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell even conceded that there are ways around the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that, if a party clearly wants to keep a settlement 
confidential, they can do it," she said. "It doesn't take a great deal of 
intelligence to figure out." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, "We are going to take them one case at a time." She added, "And 
the courts are supposed to be open to the public unless there's some reason to 
be closed."

PIG LOVERS GO HOG WILD OVER EXHIBIT AT FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people who glance at Thummer, the official mascot of the Los Angeles 
County Fair, see 600 blubbery pounds of pig panting atop a cool bed of sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
But Billie Hart, the resident hog maven at the fair's "World of Pigmania" 
exhibit, sees latex gloves, whipped cream, anti-freeze and ChapStick. 
</P>
<P>
"If people only knew how much these noble creatures give us, they'd love them 
even more," said Hart, a 72-year-old former nurse from Villa Park. "They're in 
everything we touch. Isn't it marvelous?" 
</P>
<P>
That may not have been the first thought on the minds of the tens of thousands 
of people who flooded the Fairplex in Pomona on Saturday for the second day of 
what has been billed as the world's largest county fair. 
</P>
<P>
Until Sept. 30, Hart and the "Pigmania" pavilion will have to compete for 
attention with a replica of the space shuttle Columbia, shooting galleries, 
inflatable Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and stomach-challenging rides such as 
"Orbiter," "Kamikazi," "Gravitron" and "Quasar." 
</P>
<P>
Even the livestock, often hailed as the heart and soul of the fair, is exotic. 
There's a miniature horse, pygmy goats, wild Watusis, 8 1/2-foot-tall ostriches 
and a team of racing armadillos. 
</P>
<P>
But given a chance, Hart, a livestock consultant whose business card reads, 
"There's More than Meats the Eye," can more than hold her own. Although she may 
be something of a Dr. Strangelove to the animal-rights lobby, she says her 
fascination with the by-products of four-legged creatures has only enhanced her 
respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
"You just know that they're going to be grazing forever on the beautiful green 
grass that must be up there," she said with a nod to the heavens. "I really 
feel God planned it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Look for her seated under a small tent, just a couple yards from Thummer's pen, 
behind an extraordinary spread of products -- apart from the obvious -- for 
which pigs have given their all. There's a beer can, crayons, photographic 
film, gum, an eraser, a cassette tape, air freshener, insulin and a heart valve 
encased in plastic. 
</P>
<P>
She might even pick up a baseball, courtesy of the California Angels, and 
explain how the leather comes from cowhide, the stuffing from sheep wool, the 
rubber core from the fatty tissue of livestock and the cork, although 
originally from a tree, gets treated with their blood. 
</P>
<P>
"People usually don't get squeamish when you tell them this," Hart said. "They 
just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone at the "Pigmania" exhibit wanted to talk science. 
</P>
<P>
"I love pigs, I really do," said Virginia Young, 66, who has a collection of 
nearly 200 ceramic swine at her Torrance home. "And I don't eat them either. 
They're so cute." 
</P>
<P>
But as Thummer dug his huge snout into the sawdust, hoping to beat the heat, 
Hart said being cuddly is only half his mission. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pig, there's life after death," she said. "Long after they're 
gone, they go on serving."

MANY SALUTED ROSE BOWL'S BEER BAN WITH A CAN OF SUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a very hot and very dry Saturday in Pasadena for UCLA 
Bruin and Oklahoma Sooner fans determined to tank up for their college football 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
No more brew-and-gold. Kaboomer Sooner. 
</P>
<P>
This was going to be the day that threatened to sober up those traditional 
tailgate party-goers and show imbibing fans just how dry the Arroyo Seco really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
But for dedicated chuggers, what was ballyhooed as the Rose Bowl's big beer 
crackdown turned out to be just so much froth. 
</P>
<P>
"Beer ban, what beer ban?" asked a smiling Jeff Jansen as he stood outside the 
stadium's main gate, sporting his Oklahoma Sooner jersey and waving his cold 
bottle of half-consumed brewsky. "If there's a beer ban, you can see how 
effectively it's being enforced." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, some UCLA rooters were polishing off a keg of beer, cans of beer, 
bottles of beer and the occasional glass of wine while they waited for the 
kickoff of the 1990 football season. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that this is illegal but they're letting it slide," said UCLA alum 
John McCutcheon as he nursed a can of beer. "That's my impression." 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, what was happening outside the Rose Bowl wasn't so much 
lawless activity but confusion over who was enforcing what. 
</P>
<P>
As some fans walked around drinking openly, others did so surreptitiously. And 
there was no crackdown by law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're not going to stop them unless they get rowdy," said Pasadena 
Police Officer W. L. Saltsman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been no different than in the past," said Rose Bowl general manager Greg 
Asbury. "The only change was that no alcohol was being sold in the stadium and 
no alcohol was being brought in." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the ruling? Here's an instant replay: 
</P>
<P>
To cut down on mayhem in the stadium and on the road afterward, Rose Bowl 
officials have banned the sale of beer or any alcoholic beverages inside the 
stadium during UCLA's home games. The one-year trial that began with the 
Oklahoma game is supposed to encourage a more family-oriented environment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city of Pasadena told UCLA officials a year ago that it would 
begin enforcing a longtime ordinance against drinking in city parks, like 
Brookside Park which surrounds the Rose Bowl, although they would not target 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
On the endangered list, however, were traditional pregame parties where friends 
or organizations gather to eat and imbibe. One of the largest is the Great 
Bruin Alumni Tailgate Party, which went private for the first time in its 
15-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Strand, a former UCLA cheerleader who helped found the party, which 
attracts up to 12,000 Bruins, said organizers fenced off their party, charged 
admission and called it a private affair just so they could satisfy the city's 
ban on selling or serving alcohol except at private parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's happy with the new regulations imposed by Pasadena and there is some 
question of their justification, but we are going to make the best of it and 
we're going to have fun in spite of it," Strand said. 
</P>
<P>
An Oklahoma fan, Robert Knott, stood outside the Rose Bowl before the game in 
his red Sooner shirt, red OU visor, white shorts -- and cowboy boots. After 
arriving from Norman, Okla., to cheer on the high-octane Oklahoma offense, 
Knott was disappointed to learn of a dry Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is high cocktail consumption to fuel the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But others, like high school teacher Rose Gilbert, applauded the ban. Gilbert 
said she has been going to UCLA games since 1935 and has seen some rowdy drunks 
"moon one another and take off their clothes and vomit down here." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said sales of non-alcoholic beer and bottled water were brisk. And, he 
said, there were no alcohol-related incidents or arrests among the 53,000 in 
attendance at the Rose Bowl Saturday.

SHATTERED LIVES;

JAILED TEENS' PARENTS SEARCH FOR ANSWERS IN WAKE OF TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Their parents could understand if they had spotted a pattern. Likedrug abuse. 
Or hard-core gang involvement. Or the persistent psychological and emotional 
problems that often accompany such erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
But, since Jonathan Arrington, Hubert Phillips and Khalil Mohammed did not seem 
to belong to any of those categories, since they came from decent homes and 
loving families, it is difficult to explain the events two weeks ago that 
landed two of them in jail and left another dead. 
</P>
<P>
How could they, their parents ask, have done what they've been accused of: rob 
two convenience stores in Escondido and a Vista cab driver; steal a car; lead a 
speeding convoy of police cars wailing down Interstate 5; and discuss a suicide 
pact that police believe Mohammed followed? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't figured it out," said Bob Phillips, the deputy district attorney who 
is prosecuting the teen-agers. "It's all pretty senseless. You look at the 
backgrounds, and these are kids who had options. They weren't stuck in ghettos. 
They had the availability of scholarships. It makes you wonder what went 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong has weighed heavily on those who still are sifting for clues 
involving the teen-agers. Educators don't know what happened. Parents are 
baffled. Coaches are confused. 
</P>
<P>
Johnathan Arrington, who is an assistant high school principal used to dealing 
daily with other students' problems, has trouble accepting his own son's 
dilemma. Charlie Phillips, Hubert's father, has so far refused to visit his son 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Sultana Mohammed, Khalil's mother, cannot believe she has just buried her 
17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, 19, a first-team All-Metro Conference running back who had a 
</P>
<P>
football scholarship at the University of New Mexico, is in the South Bay jail, 
held on $100,000 bail. Arrington, 19, a standout defensive back at Southwest 
High who won a scholarship to his father's alma mater, Tuskegee Institute in 
Alabama, is in the County Jail in Vista, held on $105,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Each is charged with three counts of armed robbery and one count of stealing a 
car. Phillips also is charged with failing to yield to the police caravan. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the boys' friends, Raul Olave, 18, is in County Jail downtown, held 
on $10,000 bail. He and Arrington are charged with robbing two convenience 
stores in Chula Vista. He also is charged with Arrington and Phillips with 
robbing someone of $20 at an automatic teller machine in National City, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
The four teen-agers came from similar backgrounds, and all lived within 5 miles 
of one another and Southwest High School, which they all attended. Their 
parents, hard-working and middle class, said their sons lacked for nothing. Not 
an education. Not clothing or food. Not their full support. Delores Vazquez, 
Olave's mother, had hoped to see her son in college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers were frequent visitors to each other's homes, often appearing as 
last-minute dinner guests. They excelled together on the football field. More 
than anything, though, they were the closest of companions, racing through the 
streets in Arrington's gray Ford Festiva. 
</P>
<P>
But hanging around together has meant trouble. In January, 1989, someone fired 
a bullet at Mohammed while he sat in Arrington's car outside Sweetwater High 
School in National City, Arrington's father, Johnathan, said. The bullet hit 
Arrington in the back of the head, but did not enter his skull. Arrington rode 
straight to Scripps Memorial Hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, police said, Olave and Arrington, over two days, robbed the Chula 
Vista convenience stores but came away empty-handed. The next day, they grabbed 
$20 from a man at an automated teller machine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
And, two weeks ago, police said, a frantic freeway chase began in Vista and 
ended 50 miles away on the front lawn of Southwest High School, when their car 
hit a water main. Arrington darted from behind the wheel, and Phillips 
scrambled out of the passenger seat, police said. As they were getting out and 
preparing to run, they both heard a shot, their parents said. In the back seat, 
Mohammed was dead, an apparent suicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found Arrington hiding in the bushes nearby. Phillips made it 
home, but a large number of police officers turned up that same night and 
escorted him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating whether Arrington and Phillips were involved 
in a series of hotel robberies along freeways between downtown San Diego and 
Mira Mesa. At one hotel, an off-duty Huntington Beach police officer was 
seriously wounded. No charges have been brought in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what had gone wrong, each of the parents had a different opinion. None is 
certain he has the correct answer. 
</P>
<P>
Arrington said his son, who excelled in high school track and football, let the 
pressure of his friends influence him. 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan had a problem all his life being placed in a gifted class, and he 
arranged to misbehave," Arrington said. "It seems like it's more attractive 
nowadays to be an undesirable person. Since he has not been a problem child his 
whole life, I think he feels a need to show the kids who have been in trouble 
that he can be a bad kid too." 
</P>
<P>
Arrington, a vice principal at Twain Continuation High School in Linda Vista, 
said he admired Jonathan's friends and wouldn't have let them into his house if 
he believed they had been a bad influence. 
</P>
<P>
Because he deals with problem students every day in school, Arrington said he 
feels all the more helpless that he could not prevent his son's actions. And he 
is deeply hurt by Jonathan's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a problem with alcohol. Never had a problem with drugs," he 
said. "Nobody in my family has ever been in jail. I know very few people in any 
way who have been arrested or in trouble with the police. If I knew my son was 
having these types of problems, I would have taken care of it myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Festiva, a gift from his parents, was Jonathan's bad-luck charm, his 
father said. Although his father warned him that he was not to transport his 
friends, Jonathan's buddies always persuaded him. His father even had a 
suggestion: "Get a girlfriend. Ride a girlfriend in your car, and the guys will 
be too embarrassed to get in." 
</P>
<P>
The night of the high-speed chase, Arrington was in a different car: a white 
sedan that police say he stole. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors and police, Hubert Phillips sat in the passenger seat 
during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who flunked out of the University of New Mexico and lost his 
scholarship for disciplinary problems, had been an above-average student in 
school and outstanding on the football field, gaining 1,165 yards his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
His senior year also brought bad grades and a lack of motivation. His football 
coach, Carl Parrick, said Phillips maintained a 3.0 grade point average through 
his junior year. He did so poorly his senior year that he barely managed to 
keep it about 2.0, the minimum he needed to stay in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Charlie Phillips, a 25-year employee of Rohr Industries, which 
develops airplane engine prototypes in Chula Vista, is lost when asked to 
explain his son's recent string of problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could answer why he did what he did, I would patent it and sell it to 
every parent in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips had three assignments when he left San Diego for the Albuquerque 
campus, his father said: "To keep his nose clean, get an education and carry 
the pigskin." 
</P>
<P>
At New Mexico, Phillips was redshirted during the fall and suspended by spring 
for discipline problems, according to Greg Remington, the school's sports 
information director. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to him at the university said Phillips developed a problem with 
alcohol, couldn't get to class on time, slept late, fought with others and lost 
his ambition. Despite his problems, nobody could believe Phillips would land in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not a gang guy," said one person at the campus who watched Phillips. 
"He just wasn't motivated. He was more of a follower than a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Phillips strongly disputes that his son had a problem with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubert never had a drinking problem," he said. "I went to the campus for a 
visit, and I saw that everyone went to parties and stuff. You're 18 years old, 
and you're leaving home for the first time, and parties are going on. Of 
course, you'll be participating. But Hubert knew right from wrong. He was not a 
dumb kid." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has not yet visited his son in the South Bay jail and has talked to 
him on the telephone only once. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think I could put up $10,000 to get him out of jail if I wanted to?" 
he asked. "I'm something of a disciplinarian." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips and Arrington are angry about allegations by deputy district attorney 
Phillips that Mohammed killed himself in a suicide agreement that their sons 
had discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips: "That's asinine. A farce. Never, ever, ever in a thousand years would 
Hubert commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Arrington: "Jonathan had no reason to commit suicide. Jonathan had every reason 
to live. If he had been missing something in life, like love, or a home, or 
food, if we turned him down for any reason, I could understand. I've talked to 
every kid around. Nobody has heard Jonathan talk like that." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Phillips said the suicide pact is fact. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got information that it's true, and it was something they talked about," 
he said. "If I got into any more of it, I would be giving out evidence that is 
to come out at trial." 
</P>
<P>
Arrington and Phillips also both have a hard time believing that Khalil 
Mohammed was a gang member, as police have asserted, and say their sons never 
were in a gang. 
</P>
<P>
Both were wary of Mohammed because of his brilliant mind and charisma, a leader 
who could get others to do his bidding. But they both personally liked him and 
often invited him to dinner at their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We always heard he was a gang member," Phillips said. "But I never saw any 
colors or any hat pulled down over his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed formed a multiracial gang of blacks, Hispanics and Filipinos called 
"Four Corners of the World" which got involved in territorial fights with other 
gangs, according to Sgt. Art Palmer of the Police Department's southern 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"Paco," as he was called, was the natural leader of the group because of his 
large physical build and charm, Palmer said. Palmer said the gang was not into 
drive-by shootings but rather an occasional rumble. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing that leads me to think he would have become another John 
Dillinger," Palmer said. "He was more the leader that would get something 
started and not be there when it happened." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, Sultanta Mohammed, is enraged by such talk. 
</P>
<P>
"The police have made him out to be a gang member. My son was not a gang 
member," she said last week. "It's a vicious lie! He was a good boy who went 
wrong. He was troubled." 
</P>
<P>
She will not say much more. Sultana said she has told police that they should 
not have spread rumors about her son. 
</P>
<P>
"They told all the parents that my son was in a gang, or for their kids to be 
careful and stay away," she said. "Those other boys are responsible for their 
own actions." 
</P>
<P>
Upset by her son's death and the publicity it has generated, she looks worn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going through a lot right now. Enough is enough," she said. "My son's 
dead. Nobody's going to get the story straight." 
</P>
<P>
Khalil's brother, Sultan, was so disillusioned with his younger brother that he 
kept his distance, according to Bill Kinney, head coach at Southwestern College 
in Chula Vista, where Sultan plays football. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he was opposed to his brother's group of guys," Kinney said. "He said, 
'Coach, we haven't been close for a number of years. I tried to be a big 
brother to him, but he won't listen to me.' He said his brother had been out of 
control for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
Sultan declined a request to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Delores Vazquez has told her son Raul Olave that Mohammed's death should not be 
in vain. 
</P>
<P>
When she thinks of her son, a high school graduate who had enrolled this fall 
at Southwestern, possibly robbing or stealing, she shakes her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was hanging with the wrong crowd," she said. "Individually, they 
were fine, nice boys. Together, they weren't good for each other." 
</P>
<P>
At Southwest High, Principal Alan Goycochea had only been on the job four days 
at the South San Diego school when the high-speed chase ended up on the lawn 
near his office. 
</P>
<P>
New to the job, Goycochea doesn't personally know any of the young men. 
</P>
<P>
"One teacher wrote to me, 'We have a real sense of loss that we just can't 
explain,' " Goycochea said. "A teacher who said, 'Here's a youngster I worked 
with. Here's someone I helped prepare for college and helped with SATs. They 
all had ambition.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Like most good teachers, they have a sense of 'Where did we go wrong?' " he 
said. "But I would say that we all choose for ourselves. We make difficult 
decisions every day, and there are consequences to every decision we make. In 
this case, these kids made some very bad decisions."

PLANNERS' REJECTION OF N. COUNTY LANDFILL SITES IS FAR TOO HASTY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS SHOULD REVERSE THAT DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1985, county staff members have been searching for the right site for a 
North County landfill. During those five long years, they have trimmed the list 
from 168 candidates to the three they presented to the Planning Commission on 
Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
But the Planning Commission, in refusing to approve a necessary zoning change 
and certify an environmental impact report, would have the staff go out and 
evaluate still more sites. That process could add a year or more to the search 
for a new dump. 
</P>
<P>
Why the hasty rejection? The Board of Supervisors should take its staff's 
recommendation and reverse the decision to dismiss these sites out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Then the board should commission further study of possible ground-water 
contamination that the Planning Commissioners found so daunting. 
</P>
<P>
The time for a new North County landfill is here. If not expanded, the San 
Marcos dump will reach its 7-million-ton capacity next year; if it is expanded, 
the landfill might last until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Even if North County residents ultimately are willing to pay the expense of 
trucking trash to existing landfills in other parts of the county, there are 
perhaps 10 years until space runs out. 
</P>
<P>
That's how long it took Orange County to site the Bee Canyon landfill it opened 
earlier this year, because of the complicated permit process involved. 
</P>
<P>
That facility is described as the high-tech landfill of the future, with clay 
and polyethylene liners and a sophisticated drainage system to protect the 
ground water below. 
</P>
<P>
Could such a system be successfully installed here? We'll never know if the 
supervisors follow the planning commissioners' lead and take these landfill 
sites off the list prematurely.

CRITICAL JUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The approval process for the construction of California 56 West is reaching a 
critical milestone. On Sept. 13, the California Coastal Commission will hold a 
public hearing to review the environmental impact report for the California 56 
West-Carmel Valley Restoration and Enhancement Project. 
</P>
<P>
Along with this EIR, the commission will hear testimony on the Interstates 5 
and 805 widening and the California 56 and I-5 interchange. 
</P>
<P>
California 56 is a regional solution, the only solution. Adopted by the State 
Highway Commission in 1965 and consistent with the 1989 regional transportation 
plan, it has always been regarded as a vital east-west transportation link. The 
voters of San Diego also regard California 56 as a regional road. In 1987, both 
California 56 West and California 56 East received overwhelming approval as 
part of the 1987 Proposition A half-cent sales-tax measure for transportation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no east-west freeway between California 52 and California 
78, a gap of 22 miles. It is a gap that forces regional traffic onto local 
streets and arterials, a gap that adds to overwhelming congestion on I-5 and 
I-805 in the west and I-15 in the east, a gap that affects public safety by 
severely increasing response times for the Highway Patrol and police and fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
California 56 West will convert a 1.8-mile section of Carmel Valley Road into a 
four-lane freeway. It will re-create a biologically enhanced drainage and 
sediment control channel and also modify a small portion of development area 
and land use in North City West and Sorrento Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Without California 56, there will be a complete breakdown at the I-5 and Carmel 
Valley Road interchange, with traffic volume estimated at 2,500 cars per hour. 
Additionally, forecasts show that the main lanes of I-5 would experience 
extended breakdowns during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
The intolerable congestion and safety hazards on the I-5 and I-805 interchange 
necessitate the road improvements and construction of the dual freeway. The 
approval of these two freeway projects is the only answer to the ever-mounting 
traffic problems of that area.

COUNTY DRAFT REPORT MAY OVERESTIMATE LANDFILL NEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE HEAD OF ONE WATCHDOG GROUP SAYS THE RESULT IS THAT THE 
SANITATION DISTRICTS WILL BE LESS COMMITTED TO WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report by Los Angeles County sanitation officials appears to overstate the 
disposal capacity local communities will need if they comply with a new state 
law that limits landfill dumping. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report, issued Aug. 31 by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts, argues that substantial new dump space will be required 
even if area cities meet the goals of the new law, which mandates a 25% 
diversion of waste going to landfills by 1995 and a 50% reduction by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
But in computing future disposal needs, the report uses a different method than 
specified in the law, state officials said in interviews with The Times. 
Consequently, the report shows a need for about 15% more landfill capacity than 
would have resulted from using the law's formula. 
</P>
<P>
Scaling back the estimate of landfill demand by 15% would not erase the 
report's basic conclusion that new dump space will be needed. However, it could 
have some effect on the number or the timing of new landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is likely to be seized upon by dump opponents, who see sanitation 
officials as eager to build landfills but cool toward recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The law, Assembly Bill 939, allows cities and counties to consider population 
growth in computing the volume of required waste reduction. And the draft 
report puts the annual population growth of Los Angeles County at 1% between 
now and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report also factored in a 1.5% growth rate for per capita trash 
generation -- based on historical data suggesting the garbage produced by the 
average person is increasing at that rate. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the 1.5% growth factor pumps up the county's projected trash volume by 
more than 9,200 tons per day by the year 2000. The report shows 50% of that 
amount being diverted but 50% going to landfills -- raising the estimated need 
for landfill space by more than 4,600 tons, or about 15%, per day. 
</P>
<P>
But the law does not appear to permit the use of the 1.5% trash-growth factor, 
two state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows consideration of "increases or decreases in population and not 
increases or decreases in" the average person's trash production, said an aide 
to Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), author of AB 939. "As the law is 
written right now, it appears pretty clear that that kind of addition or growth 
factor could not be" considered, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're saying may have some historical precedents down there, but it's 
not specifically allowed in the statute," agreed Chris Peck, a spokesman for 
the California Integrated Waste Management Board, which administers the law. 
</P>
<P>
A sanitation districts official disputed these contentions, saying the law must 
consider society's growing wastefulness. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nellor, chief of planning and engineering for the districts' Solid Waste 
Management Department, said he did not "see how you can get around taking that 
into account. . . .It would be foolhardy for solid waste planners to ignore the 
historical reality." 
</P>
<P>
But the head of one environmental group said waste diversion should be measured 
only against current trash volumes. She said the report's use of a growth 
factor is "completely counter to the spirit" of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an effort to secure more landfill capacity than would really be 
needed if those goals are met," said Jill Ratner, Southern California regional 
director of Citizens for a Better Environment, a statewide environmental group 
involved in waste disposal issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the County Sanitation Districts are trying to protect themselves, 
because they're afraid that people will continue to grow more and more 
wasteful," Ratner said. "Regardless of the intent, the effect is to reduce the 
county's commitment to source reduction and recycling." 
</P>
<P>
Ratner said she will raise the issue in written comments on the draft 
environmental report, which will be the subject of public hearings in October. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is complicated by the fact that individual cities -- not the 
Sanitation Districts -- are covered by the law, and subject to the 25% and 50% 
trash diversion goals. The districts own and operate landfills that take trash 
from their 78 member cities. But it is the cities that must file compliance 
plans with the state waste management board. 
</P>
<P>
The districts have helped organize cities into regional groups and have 
committed up to $1 million to help them plan recycling and waste reduction 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental report, co-sponsored with the districts by the Los 
Angeles Department of Public Works, called for extending the lives of seven 
existing public and private landfills, whose permits will lapse in the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The landfills needing expansion include Sunshine Canyon, Lopez Canyon and 
Bradley West in the San Fernando Valley, Chiquita Canyon in the Santa Clarita 
Valley and Scholl Canyon in Glendale, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report said another big public landfill will be needed by 2001 to ensure 
sufficient disposal capacity for the county. Blind Canyon above Chatsworth and 
Towsley and Elsmere canyons in the Santa Clarita Valley were identified as 
feasible sites for the next big dump, along with Mission, Rustic and Sullivan 
canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains, which together are considered a single 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that as an alternative to a new dump in the local mountains, 
large volumes of trash could be hauled 200 miles by rail to one of two remote 
landfill sites proposed by private firms in San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties.

OUTPATIENT CLINICS CRIPPLED BY CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a young man hobbled into an examining room at Olive View Medical Center 
recently, the diagnosis was simple. 
</P>
<P>
The man's dislocated ankle might need surgery, said Dr. Pramod Gan, as he 
peered at the swollen, discolored leg that had been set and put in a cast a few 
days earlier. "He really needs to see an orthopedic surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he was told that nobody at Olive View could help him. Instead, he was 
handed a yellow referral sheet and a map to help him find County-USC Medical 
Center 24 miles away. He was dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can make it," pleaded the man who said he had no one to 
drive him to County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
But he had no choice. He had arrived at Olive View on Aug. 23, the day the 
county-run medical center shut its orthopedic clinics. The orthopedic surgeons 
had been told not to show up. No one had told the patients, however, and they 
waited in vain with bandaged feet and aching limbs for someone to unlock the 
blue clinic door. 
</P>
<P>
The walking wounded were the victims of Los Angeles County's latest health 
crisis. Faced with a $7.6-million deficit, the county's Department of Health 
Services decided to reduce services at the outpatient clinics at Olive View and 
its four other major hospitals. At the other medical centers, hours at 
specialty clinics, such as urology, ophthalmology and oral surgery, have been 
shortened. Waiting times in some cases will double, and at County-USC, some new 
patients will be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were a setback for Olive View, which was already treating tens of 
thousands of patients more than they were receiving funding for. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the belt-tightening, it was taking 144 days for a child diagnosed 
with an orthopedic problem to see a doctor. A new gynecology patient was 
waiting 94 days. A person with a skin rash was waiting 118 days for a first 
visit. The initial appointment for a person with hypertension took more than 
four months to schedule. A newly diagnosed AIDS patient had to wait five weeks 
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
An immediate consequence of the new cuts will be that patients will wait even 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes an administrative nightmare. Who decides who's going to get help 
and who's going to wait?" said Maple Gray, Olive View's assistant 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to make clinical judgments and see the sickest ones," said 
Administrator Douglas Bagley. "Then on a relative scale decide who are less 
acute and try to defer them or see them less frequently." 
</P>
<P>
In the cramped clinics, physicians typically treat people who are not sick 
enough to be hospitalized. The doctors try to keep these patients out of 
hospital beds, where the costs of treatment are exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 203,500 people passed through the emergency room and the clinics, 
which are scattered along a confusing maze of corridors on the hospital's 
second floor. The clinics' popularity has soared since three years ago, when 
145,000 visits were logged at the newly reopened hospital in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
To save nearly $1 million, Olive View physicians are supposed to eliminate 
7,600 patient visits in the next 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
The dental and orthopedic clinics were shut down immediately, though 
administrators later decided to restore 40% of orthopedic services. Still, 161 
patient visits a month will be eliminated. Many other clinics, including those 
specializing in pediatrics, skin disorders, spinal deformities, kidney 
ailments, podiatry and neurology, will be open fewer hours. 
</P>
<P>
When possible, physicians are being asked to spend less time with patients and 
to delay booking new appointments. A patient who normally would return in three 
months, for instance, might be given enough medicine for six months instead. 
</P>
<P>
Those with medical problems needing immediate treatment will always be squeezed 
in, physicians emphasized. But some less-urgent problems will go untended 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Those who will suffer most will be the elderly, children and the working poor 
who use Olive View and its noisy, crowded waiting rooms. Most have no private 
insurance or they are covered by Medi-Cal, the state's medical insurance for 
the indigent. But many private physicians shun Medi-Cal because they say the 
program's reimbursements are laughably low. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gino Iovine, Olive View's associate medical director and director of 
outpatient services, said he has instructed physicians to see more patients by 
speeding up exams without sacrificing quality. But he acknowledged that the 
task will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"If you reduce a 20-minute examination down to 10 minutes, it becomes very 
difficult to decide what to do," Iovine said. "If a patient has a headache, 
it's easy to check and say there is nothing wrong with them. But, on the other 
hand, you don't want to miss a brain tumor." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians lament that they long ago cut out bantering with patients. In the 
cancer clinic, where most of the patients are dying and terrified, Dr. Harry 
Griffith said he feels more like a "technocrat." He only has time to ask people 
how they feel, tell them their blood count and ask about their chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to sit and discuss some of their concerns and beliefs and 
thoughts about how they want to die, but we don't have time," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors predict that trying to slow the stream of people into Olive View will 
backfire. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't play the shell game with patients," insisted Dr. Robert Galli, an 
emergency room physician who, like many of the hospital's physicians, is 
affiliated with UCLA. "If they aren't seen in one area, they will go to another 
area of the hospital to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened after the orthopedic clinics closed. Dr. Susan Tully, head 
of the pediatric clinic, one day found five infants with possibly dislocated 
hips in her waiting room. She spent hours on the phone trying unsuccessfully to 
persuade orthopedic surgeons at County-USC to see the infants. Ultimately, 
physicians at the private Orthopaedic Hospital near USC agreed to take them. 
</P>
<P>
"This ortho business has caused a tremendous mess," grumbled Tully, who added 
that cutting back patients in her clinic is probably impossible because worried 
parents will continue to bring in children who just need chicken soup. "You 
spend so much time trying to send them away, you might as well see them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least initially, the adult orthopedic patients bound for County-USC weren't 
as lucky as the babies. The day that physicians tried to persuade the man with 
a dislocated ankle to go to County-USC, another of the patients they referred 
was sent back to Sylmar. Hospital administrators said that is no longer 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a tremendous amount of people out there who were sent adrift," said 
Dr. Martin Morris, a private Mission Hills physician who ran one of Olive 
View's closed orthopedic clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Some physicians worry that delaying care will only aggravate health problems 
for patients who usually postpone getting help anyway. In fact, it's already 
happening, Galli said. Once or twice a week, someone suffering from diabetes, 
angina or hypertension ends up in the emergency room because they ran out of 
medicine before their next clinic appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators acknowledge that the emergency room will become more congested 
as access to the clinics tightens. The emergency room, where gurneys are 
separated by pin-striped curtains, is expected to have an influx of 3,700 more 
people this year than last year, said Tony Rodgers, associate hospital 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
With no money to hire extra emergency room staff, the wait to see a doctor, 
which can now last several hours, will be even more unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect frightens the nurses in the hospital's busiest waiting area. They 
decide in what order people will see doctors in the emergency room or the 
walk-in clinic, where less seriously ill people are seen without appointments. 
</P>
<P>
One or two "triage" nurses sit behind a counter with a plastic barrier erected 
to protect them from spitting patients, flying soda cans and medical 
clipboards. While most patients are appreciative of any help at all, the long 
waits sometimes cause tempers to boil. 
</P>
<P>
"You are being cussed out constantly, attacked and spit at," complained Yvonne 
Estrada-Heinrich, a registered nurse in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Like the emergency room, not all clinics can postpone treating patients. In the 
cancer clinic, for instance, patients with malignant tumors must be seen 
quickly and often. Consequently, 60 cancer patients are often scheduled to see 
physicians on clinic days -- a 100% increase in recent years, said Dr. Nancy 
Feldman, who oversees the oncology clinic. 
</P>
<P>
With so many patients, the chemotherapy area is jammed. To create more space, 
the two chemo nurses have sometimes resorted to laying a board across a trash 
can to make a support while inserting a needle into a patient's arm. There is 
only room for two reclining chairs for chemo patients, who are often medicated 
to prevent nausea when the drugs are administered. The unlucky ones must sit in 
straight-back chairs in the hallway. On a recent day a man with colon cancer, 
who was feeling well enough to read the National Enquirer, was asked to give up 
the recliner for a frail, partially bald Korean woman. 
</P>
<P>
The high-risk prenatal clinics could also pose problems for administrators 
trying to lower patient counts. Most of the poor pregnant women with diabetes, 
high blood pressure and other complicated problems in the San Fernando Valley 
end up receiving prenatal care at Olive View. Considering it a high priority, 
the county has provided the obstetricians with extra staff and money. 
</P>
<P>
But the opportunity to receive quality care has each year attracted a record 
number of mothers. This year, physicians will see 10% to 20% more women than 
last year's record number, said Dr. George Mikhail, head of the obstetrics and 
gynecology department. 
</P>
<P>
Some physicians privately worry that the pregnant women will drain more and 
more money away from the other clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"We are overburdened, but no more than anybody else," Mikhail said. "I wouldn't 
trade places with other departments. I get a lot of responsive ears." 
</P>
<P>

Her husband may be in the Mideast with the Marines, but Olivia Sosa does not 
want to know the details. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I watched the news, but all the analysts do is talk," said 
Sosa, a 20-year-old insurance saleswoman with huge brown eyes. "What's the 
point? It worries me. So now I just pray he'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
The three short letters Sosa has received since her husband, Lance Cpl. 
Christopher R. Sosa, 22, left six weeks ago have told her all she really wants 
to know: He's alive. 
</P>
<P>
"He asks how the baby behaves, gives his love to his mother and grandmother, 
and says it's 130 degrees during the day and 90 at night," Sosa said. "He says 
he hardly has time to write, so I'm happy to get anything." 
</P>
<P>
A quiet, industrious youth with an iron will and a talent for restoring old 
cars, Christopher Sosa has been stationed on a ship in the Persian Gulf before, 
said his mother, Rita Sosa, a 43-year-old housewife who lives next door to her 
daughter-in-law in a working-class neighborhood in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
While in the military, Christopher has traveled to the Middle East and Japan -- 
places he could not otherwise afford to see, his mother said. Her living room 
walls are covered with more than 25 photographs of her four children, including 
nearly a dozen of Christopher. She also has pinned up such souvenirs as paper 
money Christopher sent her from the Persian Gulf when he was on duty two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you about Bahrain, a small country in the beginning of the gulf," 
Christopher wrote in a letter dated Dec. 3, 1987. "The people here dress with 
sheets on their heads like sheiks. It's just like Beverly Hills in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Although she is glad her son is getting to see the world, Rita Sosa said that, 
like her daughter-in-law, the less she hears about the present crisis in the 
Middle East, the better she feels. "If I listen to the news, I won't sleep," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher had been home for only two days on emergency leave after his wife 
had surgery to remove a cyst from her spine when he was called back to Camp 
Pendleton Aug. 5 and sent to Saudi Arabia. The couple's child, Christy, is 1 
1/2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"She sees his shoes, his hat and yells, 'Papa, papa,' " Olivia said tearfully. 
"I say, 'Papa is at work, and he'll be home soon.' " 
</P>
<P>
The family says they are confident their prayers will keep Christopher safe 
because he has so much to live for. There's the 1963 Chevy Impala waiting in 
the back yard for him to restore. And there's his fledgling marriage, which 
began about two years ago when the couple eloped to Las Vegas. The couple has 
been together largely only during weekend leaves ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we just got married. We're not tired of each other," Olivia said. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Mallett walked out of his Glendale print shop in the middle of the 
afternoon again last week, but this time it was to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Last time he left work early, Mallett had just learned that his only son, 
Robbie, had been sent with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the first letter in the six weeks since the 20-year-old 
parachutist left that sent Mallett zooming home to San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter ripped it open and read it to me over the phone, but I just had to 
see it for myself," said Mallett, 38, who has had sole custody of his two 
children since he was 20 and they were toddlers. "I was so happy to get 
anything. I wouldn't have cared if it was just one line." 
</P>
<P>
Since it arrived, Robbie's letter has rested on the television set in the 
Malletts' living room, where family members reach for it over and over again. 
Mallett said the letter's place of honor is appropriate because the TV is 
constantly tuned to the news, the family's main source of information on the 
Middle East situation. 
</P>
<P>
"To be quite frank with you, I'm getting a little bored with the whole thing," 
said Mallett, who has said he fears for his son's life. "I'll bet I know as 
much as George Bush does by now." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mallett said he would like Robbie to send him more details on "what he 
sees through his binoculars when he looks out on the desert." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I was there in his place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallett said he and his family have sent Robbie more than 50 letters since he 
was flown to Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night shortly after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2. Robbie did not mention receiving those letters in the first 
one he wrote home, nor does the family know exactly where he is stationed. 
</P>
<P>
He did report that he has been promoted from the rank of private first class to 
specialist. But the promotion hardly compensates for the overseas duty. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi ya, Pops" the letter begins. "Me, I'm doing fine, just sittin' sweating . . 
. in this God-awful country." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one knows when the Middle East crisis will end, Robbie wrote that 
he has been told he will be there for at least six to nine months. Before 
shipping out, the tall, easygoing youth had been eager to get out of the 
service and embark on another career, possibly as a math teacher, his family 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That means I won't be home for X-mas," Robbie wrote. "You know if they keep me 
here nine months, I'll save $8,000 -- cool, huh? 
</P>
<P>
"But don't worry, I'll make it out of Saudi Arabia in one piece." 
</P>
<P>
Robbie has been trained to provide air defense for his unit by operating a 
shoulder-fired, infrared homing missile. The assignment is particularly 
dangerous, according to Army spokesmen, but Robbie seems to regret that the 
standoff in the Persian Gulf is preventing him from demonstrating his 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do is bust a MiG-23 out of the sky, and I'll be happy," the 
letter says. "Cuz 'happiness is a confirmed kill.' (Just kidding). I do want to 
use the Stinger though and show the world what kind of Army we are." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest problem the soldiers face, says Jimmy Mallett, is keeping up their 
morale during the long, hot days. Care packages from home can help, he says, 
adding that he is incensed over news reports that Saudi authorities are 
searching Americans' mail and destroying anything that offends their Islamic 
sensibilities, including magazines that show women's forearms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're over there to protect them, and they take their mail away," the elder 
Mallett said in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not send any packages," Robbie wrote. "They won't deliver them . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
But Robbie did ask his father to send him about $100 because his paychecks are 
directly deposited in a stateside bank 6,000 miles away. For the past week, 
Mallett has been trying to devise a scheme to get the cash past the Saudis so 
Robbie can buy cigarettes, which the Army stopped supplying free of charge in 
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie also asked his father to send him stamps, which he said are difficult to 
get. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) announced Saturday that he will introduce 
legislation to allow letters to and from American troops stationed in Saudi 
Arabia to be sent free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who recently returned from a visit to the area, said, "just about 
everyone I spoke to said that what they wanted most was letters from home and 
to be able to write their friends and relatives often and easily."

TEACHER ANGRY AFTER POLICE SEARCH LATINO YOUTHS INVITED TO HER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Barbara Nagy teaches in urban South-Central Los Angeles, but she lives on a 
quiet suburban street in Torrance. She sometimes invites a few former students 
to her condominium complex to swim in the pool, eat pizza and play computer 
games. 
</P>
<P>
On a Sunday morning last month, two of her teen-age guests got an unexpected 
welcome when Torrance police stopped them and questioned them for 20 minutes on 
the street outside her home. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths say they think they were singled out for questioning because 
they are Latino. And Nagy says she is outraged by how they were treated. 
</P>
<P>
"They're my invited guests. . . . It really disturbs me," said Nagy, a teacher 
at Bethune Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Police Department does not have a policy of targeting non-Anglos 
for questioning, said Sgt. Ron Traber, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Traber said the officers were merely responding to a call from a neighbor "who 
was concerned about the prospect of burglary or whatever. . . . They saw a 
presence in their neighborhood who didn't belong." 
</P>
<P>
The two youths, Carlos Pineda, 18, of Los Angeles, and Rafael Gonzalez, 17, of 
Inglewood, say they arrived at Nagy's home near the intersection of Carson 
Street and Elm Avenue while she was away fetching two other former students who 
also had been invited. 
</P>
<P>
The youths parked their car on Elm Avenue and ate a takeout breakfast from 
McDonald'srestaurant, Gonzalez said. They walked to the corner, and two 
Torrance police cars drove up soon after, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him we were there for a reunion," Gonzalez said. He said he gave the 
officers Nagy's name and address but, "they didn't believe us." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and Pineda said the police searched them and pulled their wallets out 
of their pockets to look at identification. The police also searched Gonzalez's 
car after asking permission, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither youth was wearing gang-like clothing, Nagy said. Pineda wore gray pants 
and a gray football-style jersey with white stripes on the arms, and Gonzalez 
wore gray jeans and a gray-and-white sports shirt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a good reason to be here. They explained it to the police. They 
should have just dropped it at that point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Traber characterized the questioning as "relatively quick." He said the police 
were dispatched to Elm Avenue at 9:33 a.m. and left at 9:56 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers called the incident "a very low-profile contact" without 
name-calling or shouting, Traber said. He said one youth looked like a gang 
member, but the other was clean-cut. The officers had satisfied themselves and 
were leaving when Nagy arrived home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything wrong here," Traber said. The police have a 
responsibility to question non-residents when needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths say that during the questioning an officer made a demeaning comment. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them said, 'Why you come here for, to have sex for money or what?' " 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Traber, after talking to one of the officers, reported that "he heard no such 
comment like that."

MOTHER DISPUTES VIOLENT IMAGE OF MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of the bouncer who has been charged with murdering a patron last 
week at a Redondo Beach bar said Saturday that her son never meant to hurt 
anyone and that reports of Eric Meyer's violent nature are outlandish and 
distorted. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from her Torrance home, Diane Meyer said her 
32-year-old son -- charged Wednesday with the Sept. 1 slaying of Michael Alvey, 
a Harbor City father of three -- is a conscientious man who only a few years 
ago had aspired to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all going to sound like sour grapes because it comes from his mother," 
she said. "But . . . he didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, a door host for the past nine months at Pancho &amp; Wong's bar near 
King Harbor, is accused of having thrown Alvey down a short flight of stairs 
onto a concrete patio, causing massive and ultimately fatal head injuries. 
Police said Meyer, who at 200 pounds outweighed Alvey by 65 pounds, had carried 
Alvey out of the bar by the neck after the smaller man got into an argument 
with another patron. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews in the week since following the incident, former employers, old 
acquaintances, other patrons at Pancho &amp; Wong's and several of Meyer's 
co-workers at the bar have described him as a short-tempered and intimidating 
man, and said they were not surprised to hear that he had been arrested for a 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, 
could not be reached for comment and has not yet retained a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But Meyer's mother, along with his best friend, Bob Jones, a 37-year-old 
refinery worker from Gardena, said Saturday that the police account of the 
accident and descriptions of Meyer as an aggressive bully are distorted. 
</P>
<P>
In phone calls from jail, Eric Meyer told his mother and Jones that he carried 
Alvey from the bar in a half-nelson hold and that Alvey fell backward down the 
stairs and onto the concrete after Meyer released him because he was too drunk 
to stand, they said. Alvey's death, they added, may have been hastened by 
another bar patron, who, after Alvey fell, dragged him 15 feet across the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Alvey didn't deserve to die, but Eric didn't mean to hurt anybody," Jones 
said. "The guy was just doing what he thought was his job. If he was so bad, 
why didn't (the owner of Pancho &amp; Wong's) fire him a long time ago?" 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, both said, only looked threatening. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncers can't go in there looking like little pansies," Diane Meyer said. 
"They have to have a stern appearance or people will just run all over them." 
</P>
<P>
She described Meyer as "a good son and an excellent father" to his 5-year-old 
son, and said that despite his criminal record and harsh descriptions of him by 
acquaintances and co-workers, he is a conscientious and clean-living person. 
</P>
<P>
One ex-boss said in interviews that Meyer was a "human time bomb" and had 
threatened to beat him up in 1988 after he fired Meyer for threatening a 
customer. Another man -- the operator of a health club in Torrance where Meyer 
had applied for work -- said Meyer blew up before they had a chance to hire him 
when he found out what the pay would be. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer served a year in jail in 1982 for robbing a parking-lot attendant and a 
month in 1987 for making a phone threat. Court records show that in the phone 
conversation, Meyer told a man with whom he was feuding that he would dismember 
him while he was still alive, sodomize his corpse and throw it in a dumpster. 
An off-duty police officer was listening on an extension phone when the threat 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's mother said that the robbery conviction was a frame-up and that the 
telephone threat was simply one episode in a long feud he had with a fellow 
body-builder who had once threatened Meyer with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if someone pulled a gun on me, I might give him a sneaky phone call, 
too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Meyer said the year her son spent in Los Angeles County Jail was a 
turning point in his life. At the time, he was a semester away from a degree in 
sociology at Cal State Dominguez Hills and had hoped to start a career in law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
But jail derailed those plans. Continuing to live at home, she said, Meyer 
worked a string of jobs, most of them at health clubs, and at one point even 
competed in the Mr. Apollo body-building contest. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to the gym every day. He never drank or smoked or did drugs," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones disputed accounts by other body-builders who knew Meyer and have 
speculated that his short temper was the result of anabolic steroid abuse. 
Jones said Meyer was thwarted in his one attempt at using steroids because the 
ones he bought were fake. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Meyer supervised an after-school activity program at Jefferson 
School in Redondo Beach, his mother and Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials confirmed Saturday that Meyer was employed by the city as a 
playground supervisor from September, 1987 to June, 1988. But Recreation and 
Parks Director Bob Atkinson said Meyer was fired from the job. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson would not say why. Another source familiar with the incident said 
Meyer had threatened his supervisor.

A Santa Barbara developer who wants to build a 50-home subdivision in Meiners 
Oaks received a setback this past week when a state Court of Appeal declined to 
reconsider his lawsuit against Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Frederick W. Clough said developer John J. Schuck of Franciscan West 
Developments has a week to decide if he will take the case to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Schuck sued the county in 1988 after it adopted a General Plan banning new 
subdivisions that would increase traffic on California 33 through Casitas 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He won the suit last year on grounds that his application fell under the old 
General Plan. A state Court of Appeal overturned that ruling in August, finding 
that his application became a new project when he reduced it from 52 to 50 
homes. Schuck asked the court to reconsider its ruling, but it declined last 
week to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after more than two years of review, the county Environmental Report 
Review Committee unanimously passed the project's draft environmental impact 
report to the County Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, the report requires Schuck to contribute a fair share toward the 
building of a $24-million highway bypass around Casitas Springs and a 
park-and-ride lot near California 33. THIA BELL

WOMAN, 21, DIES AFTER WALKING INTO MOVING BLADES OF HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Torrance woman was killed Saturday when she walked into the 
moving blades of a helicopter at Long Beach Airport, a Long Beach Fire 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released pending notification of her next of kin, 
was airlifted to Long Beach Memorial Hospital and pronounced dead at 6:58 p.m. 
of massive head injuries, Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 6:41 p.m. when the victim, who had just returned from 
a helicopter ride with her boyfriend and another friend, stepped out of the 
helicopter and walked behind it into the blades, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people don't think and they move real quick," Caldon said. "It was 
just a very unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
A helicoptor owned by Life Flight Helicopters, a private firm that airlifts 
accident victims to hospitals, was refueling at the airport when the accident 
occurred and immediately flew the woman to the hospital.

REDONDO BEACH GETS TOGETHER TO DECIDE HOW A PIER SHOULD APPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tile-roofed Mediterranean! 
</P>
<P>
Cape Cod quaint! 
</P>
<P>
More fishing! 
</P>
<P>
A less fishy smell! 
</P>
<P>
Having finally decided to rebuild their landmark, storm-shattered pier, the 
residents of Redondo Beach gathered this week for the first of three meetings 
to discuss how it should be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Barbara Doerr expressed disappointment that only 60 people showed 
up for Thursday's well-advertised public meeting, most of them activists and 
business people whose opinions are well-known. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance architect Edward Carson Beall, who has been retained to design the 
pier -- which will cost between $6 million and $7 million -- said the meeting 
gave him plenty of ideas to work with. He expects to return in six to eight 
weeks with variations of two basic layouts. They will be based on the 
horseshoe-shaped structure that was decimated by fire and storms two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody said 'Make it the statement of your career.' Well, why shouldn't I?" 
Beall said. "I'd like to make this thing part of Redondo again. It's been sort 
of divorced for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly destroyed in 1988, the 60-year-old pier is a shadow of its former 
bustling self, and the community has argued whether Redondo Beach should bother 
to rebuild the landmark at all. Despite vocal opposition from neighboring 
homeowners who argued that the pier is a magnet for riffraff and vermin, an 
advisory question on the June ballot showed 58% of voters wanted the pier 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
The question now, city officials say, is determining the future look and feel 
of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Thrown out by the audience Thursday was a wide array of ideas and demands. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion, for example, was to rid the pier of the fishy fragrance that in 
the past hung over the area like a stale fog. Though some have contended that 
any attraction involving fishing is bound to smell like fish, Beall said the 
smell could be greatly diminished by refrigerating the garbage and doubling the 
garbage storage capacity at eateries, which would halve the number of times the 
trash would have to be hauled past crowds to the dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* Separate fishing areas from walkways for the general public, possibly by 
creating a step-down fishing deck. 
</P>
<P>
* Plant shade trees and grass to create at least three miniature "parks" on the 
pier (an idea that Beall said might also create maintenance headaches). 
</P>
<P>
* Give the pier a theme based on a single architectural style -- either Cape 
Cod, to match the buildings on the pier parking structure, or a more 
Californian style such as Mission Revival or Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
* Get rid of the pier's unisex bathrooms and build separate facilities for 
women and men. 
</P>
<P>
* Do something, anything, to keep the pier cleaner this time around. 
</P>
<P>
But a few in the crowd remained convinced that the only way to improve the pier 
area is to tear the whole thing down.

BYSTANDER HIT BY STRAY BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 61-year-old Southeast San Diego man was hit in the back by a stray bullet 
fired by an unidentified man who had been having an argument with four women. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Smith was listed in good condition at Mercy Hospital, a hospital 
spokeswomen said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that two men and four women got into an argument in the 
5400 block of Imperial Avenue about 11 p.m. Friday when one of the men pulled 
out a handgun and started shooting, said Sgt. Chuck Peck of the San Diego 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was standing about 60 feet away from the group and was not involved in 
the argument, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the argument might have been between members of rival street 
gangs.

FUTURIST SAYS FREE MARKET CAN BEST SOLVE URBAN ILLS; 
</P>
<P>
VISION 2020: CIVIC LEADERS ARE URGED TO BACK GROWTH AND TO USE CASH INCENTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sluggish economy, freeway congestion and overpriced housing in Ventura County 
can best be addressed by an unrestricted free-market economy, a noted futurist 
told a group of government and business leaders in Thousand Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address to the Conejo Future Foundation, author Roger Selbert 
said the future of the region can be bright if progressive change and growth 
can overcome slow-growth philosophy and "political gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot have a steady state," he said. "Change is the only thing that is 
going to be a constant." 
</P>
<P>
Snail-paced traffic and overflowing landfills can be addressed, Selbert said, 
through cash incentives, such as charging commuters for driving during peak 
hours and boosting the cost of garbage collection for people who don't recycle. 
</P>
<P>
Selbert, who worked for six years as a corporate futurist for Security Pacific 
Bank, was the headline speaker at "Vision 2020: Shaping Tomorrow Today," a 
series of seminars and workshops aimed at solving problems in transportation, 
housing, water and waste management and the environment over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Future Foundation is a nonprofit civic think tank founded in 1972 
that includes business executives, journalists, council members and real estate 
agents among its members. 
</P>
<P>
Selbert, a laissez-faire economist, told the group that government needs to 
"develop an environment that is low on red tape . . . so that you do have an 
incentive for growth." 
</P>
<P>
Local real estate specialists and community planners also discussed such issues 
as housing prices and traffic in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
At a housing workshop, Kim Bryson, co-owner of Bryson Escrow, suggested 
breaking from traditional planning techniques to provide affordable housing for 
the county's growing population. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still building with a post-World War II mentality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson suggested taking the approach of building "high-density, cluster housing 
projects" with large areas of open space around them. She also supported the 
development of a regional growth plan drafted by a coalition of city, county 
and business interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson spoke critically of the emerging slow-growth sentiment in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we really think we can limit growth?" she said, noting that births 
accounted for 47% of the county's growth in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson said the county's population should jump to 915,000 in the year 2010 
from 653,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Although support for slow-growth policies seems to be increasing, Bryson said 
housing prices would skyrocket unless new development is allowed. "In the '40s 
and '50s you were in the mainstream if you were a 'pro-growther'; today you are 
ducking shells going over your head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The median income in Thousand Oaks is $43,400, Bryson said, and the median 
house price is $290,000. To afford such a house, she said, a family needs an 
annual income of $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases we are losing the first-time buyer," who she said are usually 
young, middle-income people such as nurses, plumbers and firefighters. "These 
people are the lifeblood that make this community tick." 
</P>
<P>
At a transportation workshop, Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission, predicted that the biggest advance in 
transportation by the year 2020 will be electronic devices that tell motorists 
where congestion is and how to get around it. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the biggest problem facing commuters is "that most people 
think mass transit is great but it's not for them. The time is now to make a 
decision whether gridlock is going to be a thing of the past."

AT LAST, COSTA MESA SHOWS GOOD SENSE; 
</P>
<P>
A REJECTED PROPOSAL TO BAR PUSHCART VENDORS FROM THE CITY WAS -- AGAIN -- 
EXTREME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several times in recent months, the Costa Mesa City Council has plunged 
unwisely into muddy waters, leaving good sense and compassion for minorities 
and the poor behind. On Tuesday, the council majority showed reasonable 
restraint in refusing a chance to do it again, this time against pushcart 
vendors trying to make a living on the city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the council acted to prohibit dayworkers from using the streets to 
solicit work, and it also tried to make charities an arm of the federal 
government by holding them responsible for screening those seeking help, as a 
way to weed out illegal aliens. Both actions, halted by the courts in one 
instance and by the federal government in the other, were aimed at forcing 
illegal immigrants out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not surprising that critics of the proposed plan to bar pushcart 
vendors from the city's streets viewed the latest action as but another move in 
the same direction, especially because most of the vendors, and their 
customers, are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The argument raised by Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed Glasgow in pushing 
for the ban was that the vendors who sell food from the carts are a threat to 
the public's health and safety. To their credit, Councilwomen Sandra L. Genis, 
who led the opposition to the ban, Mary Hornbuckle and Mayor Peter F. Buffa 
were not buying into that extreme approach. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a problem, existing regulations cover it. Vendors must have a city 
business license and a county heath permit to take their food carts onto the 
street. In one 10-day period last month, police cited 22 vendors for 
violations, code enforcement officials reported. All the city needs to do is 
continue to enforce those regulations. If police can't, or consider it too 
troublesome to try to do so, why punish every vendor by barring them from 
earning a living? 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants must also have business licenses and health certificates, and if 
any eatery is found to have unsanitary conditions that are not corrected, it is 
closed -- not every restaurant in town. The same approach should prevail for 
those who sell their wares from carts. 
</P>
<P>
The council judiciously recognized that contradiction and is considering 
stricter regulations that will require vendors to display their business and 
health permits and picture identification. We hope that the city's reasoned 
restraint on Tuesday signals a new, more responsible approach in its dealings 
with Latinos and the less affluent in its midst.

SAFETY OF BICYCLISTS IS TWO-WAY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was interesting to read Richard Beene's column requesting motorists to be 
mindful of the safety and well-being of cyclists. The story also asks that 
cyclists ride safely and responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
All very applaudable, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's talk about cyclists' use of multiple-use pathways in Huntington 
Beach. An alarmingly large number of cyclists daily ignore posted speed limits 
(10 m.p.h. maximum, 5 m.p.h. when pedestrians are present). These offending 
cyclists ride at speeds of up to 20 m.p.h. and more, weaving between 
pedestrians and other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
Last week I was struck from behind by a cyclist going 15 to 18 m.p.h., 
according to him. He wasn't watching where he was going. It still hurts. 
</P>
<P>
If cyclists want to go fast, then get out on the highway and take your chances 
with cars -- your 20 m.p.h. versus the car at 55 m.p.h. Don't be such cowards 
as to ride down a path of people on foot with your 20-m.p.h. dangerous speed, 
however.

SHELTERING THE HOMELESS MERITS TAX INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taxophobia -- a disease that has swept the country -- is creating mounting 
problems. This fear of taxation, while well-intentioned, has been taken to the 
extreme, with the result that problems that need addressing are going begging 
or receiving only Band-Aid attention. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters' efforts to maintain law and 
order in the city by removing the homeless from the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
While I agree with his efforts to rid the Civic Center of disorderly behavior, 
disorderly behavior is not the problem. It is the symptom; homelessness and a 
society morally bankrupt is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
We must demand that solutions be found to the problem of homelessness. We must 
demand that all of our elected representatives work together to find these 
solutions. And if it takes additional funding, we must have enough pride and 
sense of caring for humanity to find the money necessary to fund the solutions 
even if it means increased taxes! 
</P>
<P>
Taxophobia is a disease that is eating away at the very fabric of our society. 
All the chief's horses and all the chief's men/women cannot put the city back 
together again. Not without help.

URAM AMONG FEW SPEAKING UP FOR MEDICALLY INDIGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations on your excellent, in-depth interview with Thomas Uram 
("County's Health Care Boss Fights a Fund-Short Battle," Sept. 2). He may be 
the only official in the county with the credibility and courage to explain to 
the public what the indifference of our lawmakers to the health-care system has 
done to the well-being of the poor and to describe the damage to the surviving 
medical-care resources still available to the not-so-poor. 
</P>
<P>
Uram is the most visible public servant to describe the enormity of the local 
health-care calamity. But he is not the only Paul Revere. The alarm has been 
sounded to all the media, to the Board of Supervisors, to the governor, to all 
who would listen by the shock troops of our medical defense system, the 
emergency room physicians, and by the Orange County Medical Assn., whose 
president and Access to Care Committee have for months been screaming a 
monologue at the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are best able to observe how the blight of fiscal drought is withering 
the infrastructure of all local medical facilities. But when they speak out, 
they are accused of vested self-interest. It seems that the image of the 
Mercedes trunk lid closing on a golf bag will never be too hackneyed to be 
trotted out yet one more time by the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Cynically, it is argued that doctors want medical care for the poor just so 
they can receive fat fees. No lawmaker wants to recall that physicians have 
been serving the needy for little or no fees ever since the sale of the Orange 
County Hospital years ago freed the county of any fiscal responsibility for its 
medically indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators know of the crisis, but money is tight, and everyone has "read his 
lips," and nobody has the nerve to mention the "T word." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the poor are a feeble constituency. They have no powerful citizen 
groups to argue for them in the Legislature. There are no MADD lobbies for the 
impoverished, no Gray Panthers battling for the destitute. Each of these 
lobbies has its own important agenda that it is not willing to share with the 
medically indigent. 
</P>
<P>
The print media has mentioned the plight of the poor only in the abstract and, 
until today, without much emotional energy. It is the people -- the same 
ordinary, compassionate citizens who responded to the famine in Ethiopia -- who 
should be appealing to their government for funds for this crisis, but there 
are no pictures of potbellied children with flies on their eyes dying in the 
streets of Santa Ana or Laguna Beach to evoke their pity. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
If doctors are not credible and politicians are afraid to act and the ordinary 
citizen doesn't yet realize or care about the magnitude of the problem, where 
are the clergy? Traditionally, in our culture, when social systems break down, 
it has been the church and the synagogue that speak for the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Uram, the compassionate and courageous head of the Orange County Health 
Care Agency, ably abetted by two Times reporters, has graphically described the 
future of health care in Orange County as beyond crisis and headed for chaos. 
</P>
<P>
If we, the citizens of this county, don't force immediate and meaningful 
governmental action, the legacy of Howard Jarvis and Proposition 13 will be a 
return to an ice-floe mentality, and we will all be physically more vulnerable 
and certainly morally bankrupt.

SECOND AMENDMENT SHOULDN'T NEED DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is disheartening for those of us who believe that the Second Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution is just as important as the First to be forced to defend 
it every time there's a murder or fatal accident with a firearm. I refer to the 
"plea" for handgun control by Rod and Lois Briggs (Letters, Sept. 2). 
</P>
<P>
The Briggs' reading of the Second Amendment is that the people are allowed to 
have firearms only to support militias. James Madison, however, saw the state 
militias as a way to give the people's right to keep and bear arms maximum 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that we do not at present live under tyranny is no reason to relax our 
vigilance because would-be tyrants are everywhere, willing to take advantage of 
a people who have given up the means to defend their liberties.

IN DEFENSE OF PERSONNEL AT NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 8, Daniel C. Tsang wrote to inform your readers of errors in the way 
items in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace were labeled. "The National 
Archives would not have committed these faux pas," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since we have not yet hired our curator and recognized that we needed 
the assistance of a professional to complete the gift displays, we contracted 
with a curatorial specialist -- from the National Archives and selected by the 
National Archives -- to oversee all labeling and display of gifts and 
artifacts. That individual worked long hours to complete the job, and we are 
grateful both to her and to her employers. 
</P>
<P>
But the only substantive error Mr. Tsang pointed to was, in fact, made by the 
National Archives. He is certainly entitled to his harsh opinions about our 
exhibits, but they should not have impelled him to make correspondingly harsh 
and misinformed judgments about the library's staff. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud of what they have accomplished to open the nation's first 
non-taxpayer-funded presidential library and birthplace.

SAFETY OF BICYCLISTS IS TWO-WAY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Richard Beene's commentary on bicycle safety: When I gave up motorcycles, my 
entire family had sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Now we all participate in another life-threatening sport, but we are not going 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
We find that the rewards outweigh the risks, which we reduced with proper 
bicycle maintenance, using helmets, practicing defensive riding and using 
designated bike lanes and paths whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist can make the difference. I, unfortunately, know all too well the 
alternatives to responsible cycling.

LANDFILL FOES CHAIN SELVES TO OAKS IN PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven people chained themselves to oak trees at the mouth of Sunshine Canyon on 
Saturday afternoon in a symbolic gesture to protest planned expansion of a 
landfill there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to show . . . that we will be back when they do bring the bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
This is a warning," said Mark Andrews, 30, of North Hollywood, a member of the 
National Coalition Against Inappropriate Development. 
</P>
<P>
The seven were accompanied by about 25 other people who hiked across six miles 
of forest land north of Granada Hills that is slated for destruction by the 
landfill, operated by Browning-Ferris Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group was trespassing on BFI land, company officials decided not 
to have them arrested, though a pair of police officers were on hand. The seven 
remained chained to the trees for about a hour, until BFI officials left the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Koblin, 17, of Santa Monica said the point of the demonstration was to 
"make the public aware." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an emergency," she said.

GWYNN IS LEFT SEETHING AFTER 'SICK JOKE' IS PULLED

<P>
Right fielder Tony Gwynn started to sit down on the bench Saturday before the 
Padres' 11-5 loss to the Atlanta Braves, then looked up, stared at the object 
and began to shake with rage. 
</P>
<P>
He can put up with clubhouse gags as well as anyone. He has been teased this 
year about everything from his weight to his laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not the least bit funny. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging from a coat hook, with a rusty chain around its neck, was a figurine of 
himself. The arms were cut off. The legs were cut off. The noose was tight. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me, absolutely shocked me," Gwynn said. "I can't believe someone 
would do that." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It's like someone's testing me. This whole year, it's been like a 
test. People want to see me fail. They want to see me come down. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they can damn well do what they want, they're not bringing me down." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever was responsible for the grotesque act surely couldn't have been pleased 
with Gwynn's performance Saturday in front of the crowd of 12,802 at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn ended his slump by going three for five, driving in three runs to equal 
his season high, made a running catch in the outfield and ran the bases with 
reckless abandon. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it was a sick joke," Gwynn said after the game. "It seems like 
somebody is trying to make me the center of attention." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch said: "I was standing by the batting cage, and Tony 
said to me, 'Is somebody trying to tell me something?' I didn't know what he 
was talking about. I walked over, I took it down and threw it away. Where 
something like that would come from, I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
But Gwynn's performance Saturday sent a clear message. Go ahead and taunt him . 
. . tease him . . . torture him . . . but the man is going to keep on hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not hit with power, and I may not have the best arm in the world," Gwynn 
said, "but what I do, nobody does better. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm not embarrassed to say that." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Gwynn drove in Bip Roberts from second with a one-out 
single to left that tied the game. He went to second on Jack Clark's fly ball 
to center and to third when Ron Gant's throw got away from second baseman Jeff 
Treadway, and scored on Joe Carter's bouncer up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning, with Roberts on third and Roberto Alomar on second, Gwynn 
hit a one-run single to center, scoring both runners, and later scored himself 
on Benito Santiago's single. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, he saved a possible run when he ran down Andres Thomas' long fly 
ball that was headed into the right-center gap, preserving the Padres' 5-4 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But just as everything has gone this season, Gwynn's heroics all went for 
naught when the Braves scored five runs (three unearned) in the eighth, putting 
not only the game away but perhaps Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar for at 
least awhile. 
</P>
<P>
David Justice led off with a single, and Mark Lemke followed wit another. Padre 
Manager Greg Riddoch lifted Derek Lilliquist and brought in Greg Harris to face 
catcher Gregg Olson. All Olson wanted to do was lay down a sacrifice and move 
the runners into scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Olson laid a bunt in front of rookie third baseman Paul Faries. Faries 
was slow getting to the ball, and when he threw to first, it was off-line, 
causing Alomar to drift into the path of Olson. The ball sailed past both of 
them, Alomar dropped to the ground and Justice and Lemke scored while Olson 
went to third. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar immediately left the game, was examined by Dr. Steve Copp and diagnosed 
as having a sprained ligament in his left elbow. His status is listed as 
day-to-day, although it's possible that he could be out as long as a week. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves then made sure that there would be no comeback when Thomas drove in 
another run with a single, and Lonnie Smith capped it off with a two-run homer. 
The result was a five-run inning, the most yielded by the Padres in an inning 
since July 19 at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
And for the 11th time in 14 games, the Padres (63-75) went down in defeat, 
falling to within 5 1/2 games of last place and making it a season that will go 
down as one of the most frustrating in the franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
Really, Gwynn said, it's a tribute to himself that he's even been able to 
survive, batting .309 with 67 RBIs, four shy of his career-high of 71 set in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never gone through a year like this, believe me," Gynn said. "I'd like to 
get everything that happened to me this year and throw it all in toilet and 
just just shove it in the trash can." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn's troubles actually started during the winter meetings, when he said he 
upset after having become the seventh highest-paid player on the Padres. But 
instead of receiving sympathy, he was chastised by management and fans. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, he was the subject of the first trade rumor of his career when a 
New York tabloid reported that he was headed to the Mets in exchange for third 
baseman Howard Johnson and pitcher Ron Darling. 
</P>
<P>
The season started off quietly and controversy-free, but along came May, and 
the next thing he knew, third baseman Mike Pagliarulo was accusing one of his 
teammates of being selfish. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo never mentioned names, but Gwynn believed he was talking about him. 
After the ensuing team meeting, he was sure of it when nobody came to his 
support and he was left to fend for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a feeling, I don't know why or who," Gwynn said, "that someone upstairs 
is not happy with the way I'm playing, with what I've done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like every year I've got to convince somebody I can play this game, and 
I'm getting tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padre ownership vowed three months ago that it would sit down with Gwynn 
and his agent, John Boggs, and talk about possibly restructuring Gwynn's 
contract. They have yet to even call. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the situation say that ownership is awaiting to address the 
issue at the end of the season, particularly after contract negotiations with 
first baseman Jack Clark are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gwynn waits, saying that he wouldn't even be surprised if he's traded 
away before the opening of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what will happen," Gwynn said. "That's OK, too. Whatever 
happens happens. I'm not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, I'll have my shot too (free agency after the 1992 season). 
And I'd be lying to say I'm not looking forward to that opportunity."

WASHINGTON SIZES UP EXPANSION COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the National League prepares to make its initial evaluation of candidates 
for the two teams it will add in 1993, baseball news again is being made in 
Washington on a daily basis. But for all the smaller developments involving the 
groups led by real-estate developers John Akridge and Mark Tracz, only one 
issue really matters: 
</P>
<P>
Will Washington get a team? 
</P>
<P>
The city is the largest media market without a major-league team. Washington's 
average household income is among the highest in the nation. There's a subway 
system with a station at an existing stadium. Both of Washington's prospective 
ownership groups are well-financed with local money. And since the groups are 
proceeding separately, they are giving the National League a choice between RFK 
Stadium, where Akridge's group would like to locate a team permanently, and a 
new stadium in Northern Virginia, where Tracz's group would like to move a team 
after initially playing at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Washington seems widely viewed as anything but a front-runner. The other 
major contenders are Buffalo, Denver, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa-St. 
Petersburg. A group representing Charlotte, N.C., is making a bid. Groups 
representing Nashville and Sacramento also met Tuesday's deadline for 
submitting a response to the NL Expansion Committee's questionnaire and a 
$100,000 deposit on the $95 million entry fee. A group in Vancouver has asked 
for a 30-day extension. 
</P>
<P>
The groups that responded are scheduled to make presentations before the NL 
Expansion Committee in late September or early October. Douglas Danforth of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates chairs the committee, whose other members are NL President 
Bill White, John McMullen of the Houston Astros and Fred Wilpon of the New York 
Mets. The committee is supposed to announce a short list of finalists by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming Washington's prospective ownership groups have their finances in 
order, it would seem likely one of them will make the initial cut. And if that 
happens, so might baseball in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Washington is a viable candidate for National League expansion," said 
former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, whose keen interest in Washington was 
no secret when he was commissioner. "I think it is competitive with anybody 
seeking a team. Florida, Denver, Buffalo, Phoenix -- anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Washington attorney Stephen Porter agrees. But Porter, a former legal counsel 
to the District of Columbia Baseball Commission, is investing in a group from 
St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Washington is just a wonderful market," said Porter, one of the owners 
of the Class A St. Petersburg Cardinals, a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate. "But 
I saw an opportunity (in St. Petersburg) and think the market is very strong 
for baseball there." 
</P>
<P>
Even Sovran Bank President Robert Pincus, who has been helping Akridge form his 
group, understands the power of the Florida market. "We feel the state of 
Florida is a lock" to be awarded a team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That presumably would leave Washington in competition with Denver, Phoenix and 
Buffalo. Denver and Phoenix have been struggling to solidify prospective 
ownership groups. Buffalo, which has frozen-food magnate and Class AAA Buffalo 
Bisons owner Bob Rich Jr. entrenched as a prospective owner, faces potential 
problems concerning market size. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Washington may not be in such a bad position. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, real-estate developer and Class AAA Denver Zephyrs owner John Dikeou 
always had been viewed as that city's answer to Rich. But Dikeou encountered 
financial problems, and in July he bowed out of a majority ownership role. 
</P>
<P>
After Denver-area voters on Aug. 14 approved a referendum on a small tax 
increase to finance the construction of a baseball stadium, Colorado Gov. Roy 
Romer stepped into the breach by appointing an ownership-search committee. The 
committee produced New York businessman Mike Nicklous and former Boulder, 
Colo., attorney Steve Ehrhart, now commissioner of the Memphis-based World 
Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they constitute the local ownership baseball usually requires remains a 
question. At a Friday news conference, Romer announced the Nicklous-Ehrhart 
group had received commitments from a number of local investors, including the 
Coors Brewing Co.; Greeley, Colo., meat-packing company owner Charles Monfort; 
the Rocky Mountain News; and several out-of-town businessmen who own vacation 
homes in Vail, Colo. Three more local investors were named this week, bringing 
the group's equity commitment to more than $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another group, led by Denver businessman Cary Teraji and involving former major 
leaguers Doug DeCinces, Ernie Banks and Hank Aguirre also submitted an 
application Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix seemed to have lost its benefactor, Lake Placid, N.Y.-businessman and 
Class AAA Phoenix Firebirds owner Martin Stone, at the beginning of August when 
Stone balked at the size of the entry fee. He said the fee would make his 
initial start-up costs as much as $140 million -- a figure he considered 
prohibitive in part because he projects only $3 million to $3.5 million a year 
in radio- and television-rights revenue. He has expressed an interest in 
bidding for the Montreal Expos if owner Charles Bronfman makes them available 
to U.S. interests, but last week said he would go forward with his application 
for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Maricopa County, Ariz., Sports Authority decided to take no 
chances. It announced it would respond to the questionnaire, and obtained 
permission from the NL to do so without the backing of a prospective ownership 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The possible availability of the Expos also has interested Washington's Akridge 
and Buffalo's Rich. 
</P>
<P>
"No city is perfect," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn added he has spoken with many baseball people in recent months. "Do they 
(baseball's owners) have a closed mind on Washington? No," he said. "Is is it 
possible people were just being polite to a former commissioner? Yes. But I 
think I can read their real responses and understand them." 
</P>
<P>
Their responses probably resemble that of Chicago White Sox Chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf. "I'm sure Washington is going to be given fair consideration," he 
said. "But somebody is going to ask them to explain how it has changed since it 
has failed twice in the past." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Washington's major-league baseball history is not pretty. The 
other cities now campaigning for a team haven't had a team to lose. Washington 
had two. It lost both. The original Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961. The 
replacement Senators moved to Texas in 1971. One can argue about the 
circumstances behind those departures; but the hard facts remain. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the letter O, as in O's. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bavasi spent more than 20 years as a baseball executive before leaving 
the sport in 1987. He was involved with the start-up of the Toronto Blue Jays 
when they entered the American League in 1976. He was set to become the general 
manager of Washington's team in 1973, but then-San Diego Padres owner C. 
Arnholt Smith made a last-minute change and decided to sell the team to Ray 
Kroc instead of a Washington group that included Bethesda, Md., dentist and 
businessman Robert Schattner, the late Joseph Danzansky and the late Marvin 
Willig. 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi has been watching the latest expansion developments closely. And Bavasi 
refers to the Orioles as Washington's "geographic impediment" -- as in, 
"Frankly, I think the geographic impediment is the only thing" standing between 
Washington and a major-league team. But it's a powerful "thing," regardless of 
Orioles owner Eli Jacobs's statements that his club will remain neutral on 
Washington. Other baseball owners are reluctant to make decisions that will 
adversely affect existing clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Geography cuts both ways," Bavasi said. "You have the impact of a Washington 
expansion team on Baltimore and the impact Baltimore has on this fledgling 
franchise. You have to ask, 'Is the Baltimore-Washington area capable of 
supporting two clubs -- one that is established and one that will have to 
establish fan acceptance and a media following?' The Orioles are marketed very 
effectively in the Washington area." 
</P>
<P>
It is important (to the Orioles) from a marketing standpoint and important from 
a television standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
How important? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Villante is a New York sports-marketing consultant who was Major League 
Baseball's executive director of marketing and broadcasting from 1978 to 1982. 
Among Villante's clients are the Orioles. They hired him in 1983, about four 
years after the late Edward Bennett Williams, a Washington attorney, purchased 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the marketing meetings I've had with the Orioles, the attention paid to 
Washington and its environs ... well, they certainly spend a lot of time on 
it," he said. "Everything they do, Washington is a very important part of it. 
The site of the new stadium (in Camden Yards) was selected with Washington fans 
in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the effect a Washington franchise might have on the Orioles, 
Villante talked about the obvious potential for lower attendance (the Orioles 
say about 20 percent to 25 percent of their attendance comes from the 
Washington area). But he also raised the issue of a potential reduction in the 
size of the Orioles' radio and television audience. A smaller audience and 
access to fewer potential advertising dollars could mean less revenue for 
broadcasting rights. And with salaries continuing to skyrocket, baseball's 
owners are becoming increasingly concerned about the ability of teams in small 
media markets to remain competitive with teams in large media markets. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it (a Washington franchise) would have an immediate effect in the 
broadcast area," Villante said. "It would dampen the value of television 
rights. The Washington area is now an important part of their network. I don't 
know the dollar value, but somewhere between 25 percent to a third of their TV 
audience, at least" comes from the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' vice president for marketing, Marty Conway, confirmed that figure 
and said a similar portion of the club's radio audience comes from the 
Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Could the Orioles be compensated? Perhaps. Is the Baltimore-Washington area 
large enough to accommodate two teams? Washington's prospective ownership 
groups say yes. They say the presence of two teams in this area would benefit 
both teams as well as baseball in general. 
</P>
<P>
Florida cities don't have to face this problem. Neither do Phoenix or Denver. 
Buffalo faces it to a lesser extent. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for Washington is one of perception. People who have been 
involved with previous attempts to obtain a major-league team for Washington 
have heard them all before: Washington is a crime-riddled city. The population 
is transient and, thus, a baseball team will have a hard time building a 
well-rooted fan base. The Washington community can get excited about big events 
that happen infrequently (eight Redskins home games a year, for example), but 
becomes blase about events that happen frequently (such as 81 baseball home 
games a year). 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to answer each of those issues, and I thought we had good 
answers," said Schattner, who in addition to nearly obtaining the Padres has 
been involved with several efforts to purchase an existing team or obtain an 
expansion team. "The glass is always half empty or half full. For Washington, 
it has always been half empty." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought about Washington's chances of being awarded a team in 
this round of expansion, Schattner replied: "My feeling always has been there 
will be baseball in Washington when baseball wants to put a team in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
It may be that no matter how well represented Washington is -- no matter how 
solid its ownership group, no matter how eloquently its economic case is stated 
-- baseball's owners simply may want to put a team in Florida or Denver or 
Phoenix or Buffalo more than they want to put one in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
James Clark, a Washington construction magnate, seemed to come away with that 
impression in 1986, when he was a key part of a prospective ownership group 
that made what was said to be an impressive presentation to baseball's 
long-range planning committee. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Friday he is not an investor in either of Washington's current 
prospective ownership groups. Part of the reason, he said, is that baseball's 
owners "were not very encouraging" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the answers will have to come from Akridge's group and Tracz's 
group. Both say they are ready. And they will have to be. Their commitment, 
financial strength and compatibility with baseball's current owners will be 
compared very carefully with that of prospective ownership groups in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Said Akridge: "There are perceptions that have built up, but the facts don't 
support them. We don't have to put a spin on things or gloss over things. We 
have the facts. The facts are in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tracz: "I think the problem is that baseball people might be thinking of 
Washington the way it was in 1971. There has to be an education process about 
how the area has changed since the Senators left. We have to talk about the 
reality of what has happened around the Beltway. I think that's an aspect 
baseball has overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
While Tracz's group will not have to fight negative images of the city itself, 
it will have to convince baseball's owners that Northern Virginia is more than 
just a Washington suburb, that it also is an entity capable of supplying a 
team's fan base by itself. Virginia Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, who is from Northern 
Virginia, is solidly in its corner. And they will be seeking to build 
government and business support throughout the commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
"The balance of power" in terms of demographics "has shifted to Northern 
Virginia," Tracz said. "It's very difficult for old-line people to realize 
that. But we have to make people look at it (Washington) as a region, not as 
the city itself." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Akridge's group is saying essentially the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get them (baseball's owners) into Fairfax County (Va.) and 
Montgomery County (Md.) as well as in town," Pincus said. "Before Metro this 
was a city, not a region. But this region has grown faster than any other 
region in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Pincus said the group "will do what we have to do" to make other baseball 
owners and fans feel comfortable about RFK Stadium, on which the group plans to 
make $30 million to $35 million in renovations. Akridge is passionate when he 
talks about this issue. And when he does so in a one-on-one manner, he can be 
quite convincing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I know is to sit down with the facts and tell people the real 
story on Washington," Akridge said. "I don't believe this race will be won in 
the press. We don't have to hard sell. They will know that when we apply, we're 
for real."

TOREROS OPEN WITH 20-12 VICTORY OVER OCCIDENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It was classic USD-Occidental football -- with one exception. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1981 and the first time in USD Coach Brian Fogarty's 
eight years at the school, USD was the winner -- 20-12 in front of 4,000 fans 
in USD's Torero Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those deals where we knew we could always do it, but in years 
past, we never could quite pull it off," Fogarty said. 
</P>
<P>
This time, of course, USD pulled it off, despite: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Having to wait a while to start after the stadium's lighting system shut 
down before the game. The delay created doubts as to whether the game could be 
played but lasted only 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Having to watch Brian Madlangbayan, a freshman who led El Camino High to 
the San Diego Section 2-A championship in 1989, run for 157 yards in 28 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Having to wait until just 2 minutes 10 seconds were left in the game before 
being able to breathe easily. 
</P>
<P>
On a fourth-and-three from the Toreros 19-yard line with 2:10 left, USD 
linebacker Lenny Territo stopped Occidental quarterback John Selle for no gain 
to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Taumoepeau gained 146 yards in 25 carries to earn game ball honors for 
USD. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, taking advantage of a number of early USD mistakes, took a 12-10 
lead into halftime. The Tigers' advantage could have been much greater, but USD 
pulled together defensively a number of times to keep it close. 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan had 99 yards in nine carries in the first quarter alone, including 
a 65-yarder on the Tigers' first scoring drive. From the Occidental 31, he took 
a handoff, veered to the right sideline, high-stepped a diving USD tackler and 
ran to the 4-yard line before being dropped by Darryl Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Selle scored on a nifty keeper around left end The snap was 
high on the conversion, and Occidental held a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On its ensuing possession, USD drove 45 yards in 11 plays before All-American 
kicker Dave Bergmann was successful on a 40-yard field goal 4:29 into the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Occidental kicker Mark Collinsworth had missed badly from 
40 yards. That occurred just a few minutes before USD stopped Madlangbayan for 
no gain on a fourth-and-one from the Torero 9-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Those opportunities for Occidental came after two USD fumbles in the first 5:15 
of the game. This after Todd Jackson, USD's all-time leading rusher who 
graduated last spring, had just two fumbles in 189 attempts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's second touchdown came with 7:07 left in the second quarter and 
gave the Tigers' a 12-3 lead. Sophomore fullback Michael Winslow dived over 
from the 1, capping a 65-yard, 10-play drive. The conversion again was no good 
after a muffed snap. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:58 remaining, USD sophomore Damien Staricka scored on a 6-yard option 
play around left end to cap a 59-yard, nine-play drive. The carry was 
Staricka's first as a college player. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental looked to be in great shape after Ben White returned the ensuing 
kickoff 68 yards to USD's 20, but backup quarterback Derrick Williams, who came 
in for the first time on the drive, fumbled four plays later, and USD 
linebacker Dan Chandler recovered at the 3-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
To start the second half, Bergmann kicked a 41-yard field goal to give USD a 
13-12 lead. Then after Occidental went nowhere on its possession, USD drove 
55-yards for a touchdown in just under four minutes to pull ahead, 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Brendan Murphy hit Zac Fielder on a crossing pattern for the score.

FAY VINCENT WEATHERS A ROCKY FIRST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Friday, Sept. 1, 1989. The start of a long, lazy Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Fay Vincent was sitting on the sundeck of his Cape Cod summer home when the 
phone rang about 3 p.m. Bobby Brown, the American League president, was on the 
line with word that Bart Giamatti was stricken with a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour Vincent would learn -- by radio -- that his friend and boss, the 
baseball commissioner, was dead. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, it seems the sorrow and turmoil of that hot summer day have come 
to characterize Vincent's first year in office as Giamatti's successor. 
</P>
<P>
And while his life as a behind-the-scenes deputy commissioner ended abruptly, 
his link to Giamatti lingers. Indeed, the phrase "Bart and I" still finds a way 
of fitting into his conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"A year since Bart died," Vincent said, sitting in his office earlier this 
week. "It doesn't seem possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost him and I lost the fellow who was president of Columbia at the same 
time, Dick Gallop. I lost two guys that I was closer to than virtually anyone. 
Those were two big blows," Vincent said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart and I hung out on all different levels ... and baseball was just one of 
the layers." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I miss him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said last September that he was "willing to stick it out and perform" 
because he knew Giamatti's agenda. He was willing, in effect, to play Harry 
Truman to Giamatti's Franklin Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Just eight days before Giamatti's death, the two had finished the messy 
business of banning Pete Rose for gambling. That over, they looked forward to 
the pennant races and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sept. 2, Vincent was made acting commissioner; on Sept. 13 the job was 
his for 4 1/2 more years. 
</P>
<P>
And on Oct. 17, the World Series became the Earthquake Series, and Fay Vincent 
was front-and-center at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I think to some extent there was a problem of establishing one's own persona 
and becoming recognized to be the commissioner," Vincent said in his 
soft-spoken, measured way. "In one sense the accident of the earthquake, which 
happened very quickly after I became commissioner, probably helped that in the 
sense it was a situation where I had to do something very visible and very 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"We got through it and I think in the process I became better known as the 
commissioner as opposed to Bart's deputy. It was hard because, in a way, we had 
done everything together. I think it was hard not to say, 'Bart and I,' 'Bart 
and I' all the time when in fact Bart was dead." 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was only the first test of Vincent's resolve and stamina. Next 
came a lockout that delayed spring training and the start of the season, and 
the George Steinbrenner investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Even the rain delays at the All-Star Game and Hall of Fame ceremonies somehow 
came to be associated with Vincent's presence. 
</P>
<P>
He has conducted news conferences by candelabra (earthquake), in a New York 
hotel at 1:15 a.m. (lockout), in the lobby of a Manhattan office building 
(Steinbrenner) as bewildered tourists looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the last year normal? That's the question I've always wondered," he said. 
"That may be the normal pace here." 
</P>
<P>
He has no doubt whatsoever that Giamatti would have made the same decisions he 
has in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"There would have been some differences maybe in style," Vincent said. 
"Certainly the major issues that we dealt with during the year he would have 
agreed with wholeheartedly." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he said, he never asked himself "What would Bart do?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's not productive because I don't know that that would help me make a 
decision. I tend to think that Bart and I fundamentally agreed on the 
principles, what's important. We had the example of the Rose case where we 
worked through that so closely. I know the areas where we might have disagreed 
a little bit during the Rose proceedings. That was a tough example in a 
difficult time, and as a result I think Bart and I ... on the one hand we came 
together, and on the other hand we saw the differences in our approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is he wasn't a lawyer and I was, and therefore for me it was much 
easier to encounter litigation. Bart was like most human beings, much more 
confused, if you will, by the whole Rose litigation and the lawyering. I think 
had Bart been alive during the Steinbrenner mess he would have found that 
difficult because it was so lawyerly. Whereas for me it's somewhat easier." 
</P>
<P>
It's easier because his background was in business and law; Giamatti was a 
Renaissance scholar at Yale. Before Giamatti, Vincent ran Columbia Pictures 
Industries and was an executive with Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
He moves just as comfortably among movie stars as he does among baseball stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Candy Bergen made a great statement. I was with her one time at a friend's 
house. I said to her, 'Does it bother you that you are so visible and people 
come up and ask you for autographs?' And she said something I've never 
forgotten. She said, 'Look Fay, all my life I've tried to be a successful 
actress. I got to the point where I was successful and well known. How can I 
complain about people coming up to me when that's what I set out to do, become 
visible and become a celebrity? Once you achieve your objective, don't sit 
there and complain about it.' She was very smart." 
</P>
<P>
Like Giamatti, Vincent has a reverence for baseball that comes from being a 
lifelong fan. Giamatti didn't hide his passion for the Red Sox, nor does 
Vincent conceal his devotion to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old commissioner has managed to visit every ballpark this season, 
schmoozing with his subjects during batting practice, criss-crossing the field 
in his Faymobile. The little golfcart helps ease the pain of standing, the 
result of arthritis and a spinal injury from his college days. He relies on a 
cain to support his 6-foot-3, 240-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I was advised by people in baseball to go to ballgames, to be a commissioner 
who was on the field and knew the players and cared about the game within the 
lines. And I think I did that. I think the players know me, the owners know me, 
the people at the field know me, the groundskeepers know me. I'm there. And I 
think they know that this administration cares a lot about the game of baseball 
as opposed to the business of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what I really learned is how important baseball is to people in this 
country, how much they care about it. I travel around and people come over to 
me and tell me how important it is that I do this job properly and how 
supportive they are and how much they care about the game, how often they come 
and what distances they travel. There's a devotion to baseball that is just 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
He said his job has been easier since Steve Greenberg became deputy comissioner 
this winter, a sort of Vincent's Vincent. Greenberg is a former agent and the 
son of Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say when Steve came I really didn't know whether we would capture the 
same sort of remarkable relationship that Bart and I had, but we have, I 
think," Vincent said. "If anything, he's a better deputy than I was. It's been 
wonderfully successful from where I sit." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, naturally, attaches a special significance to the Earthquake Series, 
saying the worst brought out the best. After 11 days, the series resumed with a 
special ceremony before Game 4. Red Cross workers and other volunteers threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch, and the crowd at Candlestick followed with an a 
cappella version of "San Francisco." There weren't many dry eyes in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole pregame period was very special. I think it will be very hard to 
find a moment that is as emotionally powerful as that one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So how does he think he's done? 
</P>
<P>
"If I do give myself a grade, I'll do it privately," he said. "I don't think 
it's good to get into that." 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't nearly so shy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kept this ship on its proper course through some very, very difficult 
times," said Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, who as chairman of the Player 
Relations Committee has worked more closely with Vincent than any other owner. 
</P>
<P>
"No commissioner had a more difficult first year," he said. "That the game is 
still on its proper course and still transcends everything is a tribute to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"At great sacrifice to himself, because he has difficulty getting around, he's 
at the ballpark," said New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon, who flew to Hyannis, 
Mass., in his private plane and took Vincent to Martha's Vineyard the night of 
Giamatti's death. "He recognizes he's got to be a shirtsleeve comissioner ... 
talking to the people on the field, meeting the middle management of baseball 
teams. He's experiencing it, not preceiving it. That's a sign of his 
dedication. That's an effort." 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, head of the players association, says: "No one has made any pretense 
that he would have gotten the job in the ordinary course of events. I think 
that a year ago people would have viewed him as the guy who stepped in when 
Giamatti died. People wouldn't have that view today." 
</P>
<P>
If Vincent acknowledges anything it's that he has come to be associated with 
trouble -- the kind wrought by nature and man. 
</P>
<P>
"They were teasing me this morning," he said, dusting ashes off his shirt from 
his first cigar of the day. "They had a gnat infestation in Toronto last night 
and somebody said, 'How could that happen when you weren't there?' I had 
nothing to do the gnats in Toronto. I'm clean."

VETERINARY RESEARCHER CLAIMS BREAKTHROUGH IN BLEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Silver Springs, Md., veterinary researcher claims to have isolated an 
abnormality of the red blood cells that he believes to be the cause not only of 
exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in racehorses but of other 
exercise-induced maladies common in the equine athlete. He also claims to have 
developed drugs that will correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. John H. Boucher, there is evidence that the red blood cell 
disease echinocytosis is the root of a number of "exertional diseases" found in 
most thoroughbreds, pulmonary hemorrhage (commonly known as "bleeding") 
foremost among them. Echinocytosis, he claims, develops spontaneously when 
horses exercise intensely and is linked to muscle and orthopedic disease, 
exercise intolerance and equine sudden death. His research, Boucher claims, has 
led to the conclusion that a myriad of exertional diseases result from a single 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of echinocytosis is marked by the spontaneous production of a 
large number of abnormal red blood cells called echinocytes. These are rigid 
cells that clump together, rupturing small blood vessels through which they 
have difficulty flowing, thereby disrupting the entire circulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
Echinocytes and their relationship to tissue ischemia and abnormal pulmonary 
hemodynamics may be the missing link in understanding the origin of diseases 
associated with exercise, Boucher claims. Horses are the only species known to 
suffer disease as a result of exercise, Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the quality of blood flow to tissues of exercising horses is 
important, if not the key, to exertional diseases. An estimated 50 percent of 
horses that start into training never make it to the racetrack, but become 
discards due to exertional diseases or injury. Healthy thoroughbreds should be 
capable of racing about every 10-14 days. But not so, because of inevitable 
injuries and diseases associated with exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Studies undertaken in 1988 at Canterbury Downs by University of Minnesota 
researchers determined the blood of thoroughbreds to be three to four times 
more viscous immediately after a race than at rest. They also determined the 
cellular component of blood volume is 58-percent higher after exercise. Rigid 
red blood cells more than doubled by the end of a race. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher's company, Rheotech Labs, is developing therapeutic drugs known as 
hemorrheologic agents, which would correct the echinocyte problem by 
normalizing blood flow. These are being tested on horses at the University of 
Minnesota. Boucher envisions the drugs as replacements for current methods of 
treatment, particularly for furosemide (Lasix), which recent studies claim is 
not effective in treatment of pulmonary hemorrhage and acts as a 
performance-enhancing agent. Lasix, while prohibited for racing use in New 
York, is legal and widely used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs being developed by Boucher's firm, he claims, have no effect upon 
performance beyond normalizing blood flow. Boucher says these drugs also lack 
the power to mask the presence of other drugs, which is among the most 
controversial properties attributed to Lasix, a powerful diuretic. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher's research is a great distance and a substantial amount of 
developmental funding short of being approved by the Federal Drug 
Administration and eventually reaching the marketplace. It is further still 
from approval for racing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"If (bleeding) or any of the other exertional diseases that plague and abuse 
racehorses can be conquered, then the entire racing industry would gain," 
Boucher said. "The gain would result from eliminating the needless loss of 
horses to disease, injury and death. That economic devastation drains trainers, 
horse owners and racetrack management."

SAN FRANCISCO IS NO MATCH FOR HEAT, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the fuss earlier in the summer about the Los Angeles Heat moving, one 
has to wonder if Saturday night's first game of the American Professional 
Soccer League West championship at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach was the final 
nail in the South Bay's coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before 3,500 -- its largest home crowd of the season -- Los Angeles 
dominated the San Francisco Blackhawks in a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The home-and-home series resumes Wednesday at San Jose's Spartan Stadium and 
all the Heat have to do is win in regulation to claim their first APSL West 
title. A 30-minute mini-game would be played if San Jose wins. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco midfielder Marcelo Balboa, a member of the United States World 
Cup team, reinjured a ligament in his right knee in the first half and limped 
off the field. His status was listed as day-to-day. Balboa scored both goals in 
a 2-1 victory over the Heat at West Torrance High on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat won only five of 10 league games at West Torrance High, normally their 
home field, but has won seven of their last eight road games. Overall, L.A. has 
won eight of its past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Heat midfielder Jim Gabarra scored the first goal by slapping a weak cross off 
the sole of his foot into the net with 20:43 gone. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat came out shooting and led in total shots 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Brad Smith, who scored the second goal off an assist from Bobby Bruch 
with 35 minutes remaining, said, "We have to take them one at a time, and we 
have one left, but we have finally found the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Heat President John Ajemian might have found the picture, too. A handful of 
dissident owners were rankled when Ajemian, who bought into the team this 
spring, announced he was planning to move the team to South Orange County next 
year. But excited by the results and the crowd Saturday night, a Heat 
spokesperson said that the team might consider playing at Veteran's Stadium, a 
compromise of sorts, between the South Bay and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The APSL West champion advances to play Maryland, the APSL East champion, for 
the national title on Sept. 22. The winner of that game plays the Canadian 
champion Vancouver 86ers for the North American title on Sept. 26.

SOUTHWEST SPUTTERS IN 21-7 VICTORY OVER RIO HONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no surprises Saturday afternoon during L.A. Southwest's football 
opener against Rio Hondo at Southwest. It turned into a rather boring and 
sloppy game with little scoring and few exciting plays. 
</P>
<P>
But Southwest's players were ecstatic after the 21-7 victory in which they 
committed numerous penalties and four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad we got through this," Southwest Coach Henry Washington said. 
"We're going to be a lot better football team down the line.' 
</P>
<P>
Washington also believes that sophomore quarterback Craig Manigo, who led 
Southwest to its first postseason bowl last year, will perform a lot better in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Craig was a little nervous," he said. "I expect him to do a lot better 
later on." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 150-pound Manigo completed 10 of 19 passes for 101 yards, three 
touchdowns and three interceptions. His 12-yard touchdown pass to freshman 
receiver Michael Stephens started the scoring with 11:38 left in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The pass completed a five-play, 39-yard drive. Freshman Angel Andrade's extra 
point put the Cougars ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Hondo, third in the Foothill League last season, scored its only touchdown 
with 2:46 remaining in the second quarter after linebacker Gus Flores 
intercepted a Manigo pass that was intended for Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners went 46 yards on four plays to tie the score. Quarterback 
Albert Solarzano passed to Gabe Cotero for a 25-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars drove 66 yards on six plays on their next possession. Manigo passed 
27 yards to freshman tight end Michael Scott for a 13-7 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars scored their last touchdown with 9:40 remaining. After driving 43 
yards in eight plays, Southwest punted only to regain possession and 15 yards 
after a Rio Hondo penalty on the kick. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman running back Larry Edmonds ran five yards on first down, and Manigo 
hit Stephens for a 12-yard touchdown pass and 19-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo connected with Stephens for the two-point conversion and 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are off next week. They will open Western State Conference play at 
Harbor College on Sept. 22.

YELLOWTAIL BITE SLOWS, BUT BONITO ACTION HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Big bonito provided anglers aboard Redondo Sportfishing's fleet plenty of 
action over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Dan Armstrong said that schools of bait fish at rocky point helped 
lure bonito into the area. The bonito weighed up to eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the yellowtail bite slowed due to the heavy holiday traffic. 
Bonito have accounted for the daily 10-fish limit. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun returned Monday from a two-day albacore trip. 
Only 10 albacore were landed along with 15 skipjack and four dorado. Steve Oba 
of West Los Angeles won the jackpot with his 20-pound albacore. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Johnson of Torrance caught a 22-pound yellowtail and lost one of the 
jackpots to a dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The half-day boat Matt Walsh from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing was fishing outside 
the horseshoe kelp area when a marlin jumped near the stern of the 65-foot 
sportfisher. Felix Cowall of San Pedro had a small mackerel on his hook and 
made a cast toward the area where the marlin had jumped. 
</P>
<P>
Cowall had a strike and a marlin peeled all his 30-pound test line. Capt. Ray 
Duane moved the boat with fighting fish. 
</P>
<P>
Cowall was unable to gain any line, and after 15 minutes, his line snapped. 
Duane estimated the fish to be in excess of 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Giant squid have invaded an area three miles out from Point Fermin. The live 
bait boat Chovey Clipper, which supplies anchovies to the South Bay 
Sportfishing fleet, was preparing to make a set for bait when giant squid came 
up to the boat's floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Bill Verner and his crew were able to scoop up four squid, which were 
placed in the bait well. 
</P>
<P>
A call was made to Larry Fukuhara at the Cabrillo Museum who had the squid 
transferred to the museum's holding tanks. Fukuhara said that one squid on 
display is 15 pounds and 14 1/2 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Information: Cabrillo Museum (213) 548-7562 
</P>
<P>
Benny Marsh of Wilmington was fishing for bonito from his 20-foot skiff near 
Portugese Bend and snagged a giant squid. He said it was about eight-feet long 
and weighed 11 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven marlin were weighed in during the weekend at Avalon's scale. Brian Rapf, 
7, of Malibu caught his first marlin and it took him only 25 minutes to land 
it. It weighed 139 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches -- Jim Kinsinger of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Shogun on a 
tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week, a 48-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Rubinson of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina aboard the Toronado, caught 
a 30-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Torres of Torrance, fishing aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 26-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Moon of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Aquaris, caught a 25-pound white 
sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Jenstrom of Redondo Beach, fishing at horseshoe kelp aboard the Victory, 
caught a 22-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Garrett of Redondo Beach, fishing aboard the City of Redondo, caught an 
18-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports -- There are schools of bullet tuna moving into local waters. San

EL CAMINO BRUSHES PAST VENTURA, 48-26 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Ventura College football Coach Dick James should have demanded a 
recount when his team, in a near-unanimous vote, elected to schedule El Camino 
in its 1990 opener. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino is 31-1 over the past three years and finished fifth in the final 
1989 national Junior College Athletic Bureau poll. The Warriors, who draw 
heavily from City Section prep powers Carson and Banning, were ranked No. 2 in 
the nation by USA Today in a junior college preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night against Ventura, El Camino won in a landslide, defeating the 
Pirates, 48-26, in a nonconference opener at Ventura High's Larrabee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of schools won't play us. They simply dodge us," El Camino Athletic 
Director Dave Shannon said. "I take my hat off to Ventura that they would 
schedule us." 
</P>
<P>
James' Pirates were competitive, drawing close in the third quarter by making 
big plays and capitalizing on El Camino turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino jumped to a 21-0 lead in the second quarter. A fumble by Ventura 
quarterback Tim Albrent set up Anthony Daigle's five-yard touchdown run in the 
first quarter, and the Warriors scored again in the second quarter when Shannon 
Thompson caught a flat pass from Rod Harvey and went 28 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by Ventura running back Robert Cunningham at his own five set up a 
five-yard touchdown run by Daigle for a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle led all rushers with 173 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Big plays drew Ventura close until the fourth quarter. Tony Williams went 53 
yards in the second quarter for Ventura's only touchdown of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
After El Camino went up, 28-6, early in the third quarter, Chris Thomas romped 
89 yards down the left sideline for a touchdown on the ensuing kickoff return, 
cutting Ventura's deficit to 28-12. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by El Camino's Bryan Reeves on a punt return gave Ventura the ball at 
the Warrior seven-yard line late in the third quarter, and Albrent hit Charles 
Roberson for a seven-yard touchdown pass two plays later. After making a 
two-point conversion, Ventura trailed, 28-20. 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino blew the game open in the fourth period, scoring three 
touchdowns, including Ivan Wilson's 71-yard scoring run.

Charles Taumoepeau gained 146 yards in 25 carries to lead the University of San 
Diego past Occidental, 20-12, before 4,000 in USD's Torero Stadium. It was the 
first Torero victory over Occidental since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman running back Brian Madlangbayan led the Tigers with 157 yards in 28 
carries, including 99 yards in nine first-quarter carries.

Junior quarterback John Selle gave Occidental a 6-0 lead in the first quarter 
when he scored on a four-yard run around left end after a nice fake up the 
middle by Madlangbayan. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's second touchdown came with 7 minutes 7 seconds left in the second 
quarter and gave the Tigers a 12-3 lead. Sophomore fullback Michael Winslow 
dived over from the one, capping a 10-play, 65-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
All-American kicker Dave Bergmann kicked a 41-yard field goal to start the 
second half, giving USD a 13-12 lead.

EAST L. A. COMEBACK SHOCKS PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago Alvarez hit Kevin Owens with a 17-yard touchdown pass with 1 minute 30 
seconds to play, lifting East Los Angeles College to an improbable 32-31 
nonconference win over host Pierce on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a seemingly comfortable 31-20 lead with seven minutes remaining, Pierce 
watched helplessly as Alvarez completed his third and fourth touchdown passes 
of the game to lead the Huskies to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, a freshman who passed for 4,019 yards last season at Franklin High, 
completed 29 of 44 passes for 371 yards against Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
After the final touchdown, Pierce got the ball back two times. On the first 
possession, quarterback Jamie Grossman was intercepted at the East L.A. 
nine-yard line and on the second series, Derek Chernow's 42-yard field-goal 
attempt was blocked as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierce loss put a damper on freshman LaShante Parker's collegiate debut. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a standout at Palmdale High last season, gained 117 yards in 19 carries 
and scored Pierce's first two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas jumped to a 13-0 lead in the game's first 3 1/2 minutes before 
wilting down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Parker returned the opening kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown and, after the 
Brahmas forced East L.A. to punt, Pierce drove 83 yards in four plays for 
another score. 
</P>
<P>
Parker went the final 31 yards on a draw play, but it was tight end Scott 
Wheeler's 49-yard reception and run that keyed the drive. 
</P>
<P>
In what would be a rare sight, Chernow converted a point after. Pierce missed 
four of five conversion attempts (three kicks, two two-point attempts) and it 
came back to haunt the Brahmas. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce took a 25-7 lead on Grossman's 22-yard touchdown pass to Jay Rich with 
37 seconds left in the half, then put on a clinic on how not to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
Pinned on their own 23-yard line, the Huskies proceeded to march 77 yards in 
five plays. Pierce aided the East L.A. drive with a personal foul after a 
15-yard run by Larry Espinosa, then gave up two touchdowns in the last 12 
seconds, although only one of them counted. 
</P>
<P>
The first score came on a first-down play from the Pierce 26. Alvarez completed 
a pass to Carl Gilliam at the 12-yard line, and Gilliam bounced off Brahma 
defensive back Carlton Bowen and waltzed into the end zone as time expired. A 
personal foul nullified the score, however. 
</P>
<P>
No matter: Alvarez connected on a 45-yard Hail Mary pass to Owens on the next 
play.

MILES HELPS PASADENA OUTDISTANCE GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone knew about the big, bad Wolf, Pasadena City College's highly touted 
tailback Wolf-Payne Barber, but it was the lesser-known Ostell Miles who 
provided the crucial yardage in Pasadena's 17-7 victory over Glendale Saturday 
in a nonconference opener. 
</P>
<P>
Miles scored Pasadena's first touchdown on a first-quarter, one-yard plunge and 
finished with 107 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Barber, meanwhile, didn't get untracked until the second half and finished with 
54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Coach John Cicuto was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have great running backs at this school," Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale didn't get untracked until the second half against a Pasadena team 
picked as the fourth best in the country in one preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale scored with 5 minutes 24 seconds left in the third quarter when Bobby 
Webster danced around right end on a four-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's run climaxed a 12-play, 80-yard drive in which Glendale relied on the 
power running of fullback Wes Bender and the speed of Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Webster finished with 91 yards to lead Glendale, and Bender had 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale threatened to pull within a touchdown late in the game. Robert Floyd 
intercepted a pass from Pasadena's Ken Edwards and returned the ball to the 
Pasadena 26. 
</P>
<P>
However, on the next play, Glendale quarterback Marco Arcipreste's pass was 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale later drove to the Pasadena 22 with less than two minutes left, but 
Arcipreste threw another interception and Pasadena ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marco is going to develop," said Cicuto, who also played quarterback 
Cole Speer in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arcipreste finished with 80 passing yards and Speer threw for 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"This team can be a good team if they become more disciplined on both sides of 
the ball," Cicuto said.

Marty Washington passed for 165 yards and two touchdowns to lead visiting 
Antelope Valley College to a season-opening 22-15 victory over San Diego City 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, a former redshirt at Grambling, completed 14 of 42 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Miller rushed for 105 yards in 19 carries and David Brown and Chris 
Johnson caught scoring passes from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in confusion. With the game clock broken, Antelope Valley let a 
free kick drop untouched. The Knights recovered and marched to the Antelope 
Valley 11-yard line before the officials declared the game over.

HART'S DIXON RULED INELIGIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Dixon, the top returnee from Hart High's Southern Section 3-A Division 
cross-country champion team, has been declared academically ineligible for the 
first month of the season. He could become eligible next month if he maintains 
a 2.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"He realizes his mistakes and is trying his best to make up for them," Hart 
Coach Gene Blankenship said. I have no doubt he will be back and running in 
five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, a senior who recorded marks of 4 minutes 23.4 seconds and 9:24.32 for 
1,600 and 3,200 meters in track last season, was Hart's second man on a team 
that advanced to the state Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
Hart is ranked second in the preseason Southern Section Division II poll.

After the ensuing kickoff, Fillmore stopped Pater Noster in four plays and set 
up a short drive that ended when Alvarado ran two yards for the first of his 
two touchdowns. His other touchdown came on a one-yard run late in the first 
half. 
</P>

FITZGERALD'S FIELD GOAL LIFTS AGOURA;

Agoura High beat Santa Clara, 3-0, Saturday after both teams stumbled through 
two sloppy hours in a nonleague game that might only go to show that the 
Chargers are not quite as bad as the Saints at this point in the season. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Agoura's 146 total yards are only impressive compared to Santa 
Clara's 86. And the teams combined for 177 penalty yards and eight turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, neither coach was impressed with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more kinks than anything else," Santa Clara Coach Larry Lawrence said. 
"If we had gone out and played hard and were beaten by a better team, I could 
accept the loss, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura wasn't much better than the Saints, who have been hurt by inexperience 
and injuries. The Charger offense sputtered and eventually escaped on Pat 
Fitzgerald's 30-yard field goal with 56 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither team was functioning on all cylinders," Agoura Coach Frank Greminger 
said. "We weren't ready offensively. We played decent defense, and I'm not even 
sure about that." 
</P>
<P>
The series of plays that perhaps best described the contest occurred early in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura was unable to field the second-half kickoff and Santa Clara recovered at 
Agoura's 19-yard line. Santa Clara's Lloyd Mix fumbled on the second play from 
scrimmage. Agoura recovered and on the next play, Matt Francisco (50 yards in 
15 carries) fumbled it back to Santa Clara at the eight. The Saints couldn't 
advance past the four, where they returned the ball to Agoura on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura also fumbled the ball away at its 49 with 11 minutes 10 seconds 
remaining. The Saints advanced to the 16 with 7:17 left but lost 17 yards in 
the next five plays, and Agoura again took over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Clara penalty on a punt prolonged Agoura's drive and gave the Chargers 
a first down., When Agoura finally was forced to punt again, the Saints fumbled 
and Sina Sayahi recovered to preserve the victory.

Junior quarterback Richie Donati threw three scoring passes to wide receiver 
Ricky Demarest, leading Bishop Diego High to a 30-13 nonleague victory over 
Calabasas at Santa Barbara on Saturday night in the opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego, which won only one game last season, went to the air early and 
often, scoring on its first possession on a 10-yard pass from Donati to flanker 
Benito Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas put together an impressive 11-play, 78-yard scoring drive, capped by 
Ron Adelman's seven-yard pass to tight end Cameron LaBrache to tie the score, 
7-7, early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Donati-to-Demarest connection began to click. 
</P>
<P>
Donati threw scoring strikes of 21 and 34 yards to Demarest in the second 
quarter. A 10-yard touchdown strike in the third quarter capped the Cardinal 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Donati also kicked a 29-yard field goal for Bishop Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas mounted a 70-yard drive late in the third quarter, with running back 
Dave Christiansen scoring on a six-yard run over right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Donati completed nine of 19 passes for 167 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen gained 73 yards in 15 carries and Adelman completed seven of 13 
passes for 84 yards for the Coyotes. PAUL OLSON

<P>
We have paid a heavy price for this community. Let those who would comment 
lightly on us beware: We are unforgiving judges of those who have not shared 
our experiences. We are like a secret society. We have our own language; we 
recognize signs that no one else does; we joke about our most intense pain, 
bewildering outsiders; we walk a tightrope pitched over an abyss of panic that 
a novice does not even perceive, let alone understand. 
</P>
<P>
We are provoked to anger and fear by the smallest detail while suffering 
calamity calmly. We are, each of us, bundles of nerves wound up so tightly into 
little balls of extra-awareness that we bounce off the walls of our personal 
and collective catastrophes with an apparent ease. 
</P>
<P>
Every new battle, every new death, every new car bombing and massacre, every 
new piece of bad news is felt by each of us as a personal injury to be borne 
silently. A patient in hospital being subjected to an endless series of 
injections, jabs and other ignominies will eventually cease to protest and will 
lapse into quiet endurance, even as each jab is felt by every nerve in his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
So, at all costs, we doggedly, stubbornly carry on, but always with an 
obsessive eye on the outside world against whose established reality we measure 
our own, fraught with doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Beiruti's eye is constantly confronted by buildings in various 
stages of collapse; broken glass and torn awnings; dangling and broken electric 
signs: that once glittered in advertising gaudiness; shabby, dirty, overcrowded 
streets; blocks full of refugees, their children playing in the piles of 
rubbish scattered here and there, monuments to the war; telephone and electric 
lines hanging loosely from bent poles; stray dogs and cats, diseased and slow, 
sniffing at the garbage on empty corners. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient ruins are, somehow, beautiful and uplifting; the imagination works on 
them, restores them to their original state and function and brings those who 
built them to life. Modern ruins, however, are ugly and depressing. It is not 
the imagination but the memory that works on them, and there is nothing sweet 
in the memory of war. 
</P>
<P>
The ear, too, is constantly affronted not only with explosions, bullets, 
screaming jets and sirens, but also with the sound of glass shattering (or, 
later, the so-familiar sound of glass being swept up), of the anarchic traffic 
negotiating ever narrower streets and smaller neighborhoods. Now, the most 
recent irritant is the sound of an ever-increasing number of intensely noisy 
generators lining the streets or perched high up on balconies, making a 
deafening roar. When and if it ever comes, peace will mean to us quiet as much 
as anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Our horizons have been so narrowed by the war that we suffer a terrible form of 
claustrophobia and, every now and then, remind ourselves of the old days when 
we would drive for hours to get somewhere far away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now we are confined, not only each to our own city and town but even to our own 
quarter in the city. The confinement is not only physical but social as well. I 
look in my telephone book sometimes and read it to remind myself of the 
existence of people whom I have forgotten, to see if there isn't someone around 
whom I can visit as a change from my few remaining friends. My friends' words, 
motions and gestures are so predictable that I can anticipate them, and often I 
feel I may as well talk to myself (which, by the way, I have caught myself 
doing once or twice). But the telephone book yields nothing but a profound 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
I read the names of those who have moved away, gone to America, England, Amman 
or Athens; those who have died, some naturally, some violently; and those whom 
I no longer care to see. I have shed people in rather the same way as I have 
shed clothes that no longer fit, or whose shape no longer appeals to me, and 
put them away. In a strangely morbid way, however, when the old telephone book 
is worn out and tattered and I start a new one, I mechanically copy into it all 
the names and numbers, including those of the distant and the dead, as though 
by this doubtful magic I would resuscitate them and the old days, as though I 
would erase the last terrible years. 
</P>
<P>
 April 28, 1989: The water came (on) this morning! I poured it on the plants. 
What a pleasure it was to fill the watering bucket over and over again and to 
soak the leaves, the soil; to see the geraniums lifting their drooping heads at 
last. I gave them shower after shower and felt intoxicated at the feel of my 
wet feet as the excess water splashed on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
May 11, 1989: The other night in the shelter I saw a cockroach. It was an 
enormous one, a member of a flying species that thrives here especially in the 
hot months. Often in the summer, one of these creatures would fly in through 
the window and the whole household would be in pandemonium, so disgusting are 
they. Cushions, brooms, shoes, anything at hand would be held up in the general 
mobilization against this invidious intruder; and everyone would shudder when 
it was finally tracked down and crushed, its remains swept up and flushed down 
the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
That night in the shelter, I felt no such revulsion. I watched the cockroach 
crawling in the corner near which I sat and wished it no harm, feeling that it 
was a kindred spirit, a creature, like me, of dark hidden places, living out 
its life in ignominy.

AN ARAB POINT OF LIGHT THAT BUSH SHOULD NURTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mansour Farhang, Mansour Farhang, professor of politics at Bennington 
College, was revolutionary Iran's first ambassador to the United Nations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I met President Saddam Hussein in late August, 1979, at the Ninth Non-Aligned 
Heads of States conference in Havana. I was a political adviser to the Iranian 
delegation. It was during that meeting that representatives of revolutionary 
Iran first encountered the Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
Although the talks were largely useless, they provided some glimpses into the 
nature of Hussein's personality and leadership. Twice in the course of the 
two-hour discussion, he lifted a cigar from his breast pocket. Instantly, his 
two interpreters, each flashing a fancy cigarette lighter, jumped to their feet 
and vied to be the one who lit the president's cigar. At another time, I 
noticed two Iraqis walking backward and sideways when they left and returned to 
the room -- in an effort to avoid turning their backs to the exalted leader. 
Throughout, Hussein appeared disdainful of the Iranian delegation's uninhibited 
mode of expression. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein is a modern dictator, par excellence. The country he rules is 
aptly described as the "Republic of Fear." The delusion of grandeur that sent 
Iraqi soldiers into Kuwait again highlights the primary and lasting cause of 
the state violence that plagues the Middle East and threatens world order: 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, not a single Arab head of state in the Middle East has 
retired or limited his tenure to a fixed term. They have either died in office, 
been assassinated or deposed. The pro-Western dictators rationalized their 
repressive rule by invoking the communist threat, and Washington was all-too 
willing to assist them with training and equipment. Radical nationalist despots 
justified their brutality in the name of fighting imperialism or Zionism. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cold War is over, the United States cannot credibly continue its 
support of Arab dictatorships under the guise of protecting them against Soviet 
intrusion. Moscow's unambiguous condemnation of Hussein's aggression should 
convince remaining skeptics that obstacles to peace and civility in the Middle 
East lie not beyond the region's border but within its atavistic political 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East has been devoid of any concern for the 
general lack of democracy there. In the post-Cold War era, such concern need 
not contradict legitimate U.S. interests in the region. In fact, it may well be 
the least costly way of safeguarding those interests. 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, a preference for political 
pluralism is, in various degrees, an element of U.S. diplomacy and trade 
policy. With American lives on the line in the Arabian sand, U.S. policy-makers 
must abandon their static view of the region's politics and political cultures. 
The tribal roots of Arab dictatorship make the road to democracy more difficult 
than some other parts of the Third World, but the region's natural resources 
could enable its peoples to overcome the material impediments to democratic 
behavior with more speed than many other societies. 
</P>
<P>
Washington frequently makes observance of human rights a condition of doing 
trade or aid business with it. It has never done so in the Middle East. But why 
shouldn't the Saudi government permit its citizens to monitor its tolerance for 
human rights in exchange for U.S. arms? Why shouldn't the sale of grain or 
communication technologies to Iraq be tied to the regime's treatment of its 
Kurdish minority? The grievances of secularists in Saudi Arabia, and of Kurds 
in Iraq, are at least as serious and legitimate as those of the anti-communists 
in China or Jews in pre-Gorbachev Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Every year the State Department publishes the details of extreme and pervasive 
human-rights violations in the states of the Middle East, and the White House 
responds as if the information were from another planet. The pro-democracy 
forces of many Third World dictatorships have their defenders in the U.S. 
Congress -- but not a single Arab country is among them. If the United States 
goes to war with Iraq, it would be the first time that American soldiers would 
die on foreign soil without the honor of dying for democractic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait presents the United States with a historic 
opportunity to include a pro-democracy objective in its Middle East policy. 
Doing this would not require a sudden change of direction or abandonment of 
allies. Forces for democracy, to be sure, have to emerge from within society. 
But Washington can foster them by encouraging the growth of a political culture 
that protects dissident voices. 
</P>
<P>
This approach would help to blunt the appeal of Hussein's demogogic tactic of 
emphasizing the double standards in U.S. foreign policy. It would also head off 
his attempts to project a Robin Hood image of himself, which can resonate with 
the Arab masses. Hussein is probably the most brutish of Arab leaders, but his 
rule is no less legitimate for being so. His expansionist drive can be readily 
comprehended if we remember that nothing produces more hubris in the mind of a 
dictator than success. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while Iraq's aggression must be rolled back, restoring the Sabah dynasty 
to power in Kuwait can hardly make the American people feel proud. Siding with 
a tribal family who arrogated to itself an eternal right to rule and exploit a 
country's oil reserves as its private property is not exactly an envious 
position for a nation that takes pride in championing democracy throughout the 
world. The U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf ought to have a more 
worthy purpose than safeguarding a "lifestyle." A stated preference for 
democracy can be this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's despotism should be countered by its antidote. Internationally 
supervised elections have been held in Namibia, Nicaragua, Cambodia and 
Afghanistan. Why not in Kuwait? It would be difficult to reach such an 
agreement but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
His rhetoric aside, Hussein does not relentlessly adhere to any dogma. While at 
war with Iran, he portrayed himself as the protector of the gulf sheikdoms' 
sovereignty. Today, he wants to terminate their autonomy and special status. 
For 10 years, he ridiculed Khomeini's preachings and claimed to be the defender 
of secular politics against Islamic fundamentalism. Today, he calls for a holy 
war. 
</P>
<P>
He is not oblivious to means and ends. He is both high-risk gambler and 
ruthless realist. He simply wants to expand his domain as the all-powerful 
leader, but he is unscrupulously flexible in choosing his means of reversing 
his course, particularly when the survival of his regime is at stake. In short, 
Hussein can be forced to retreat sooner than it is generally believed. 
</P>
<P>
War between the United States and Iraq will aggravate our Middle East problems 
and intensify the fragmentation and repressiveness of Arab states. Only a 
movement toward democratization can ease the dilemmas and frustrations that 
underly the spread of violence and adventurism in the region.

'GALLANT LITTLE KING' IS NO LONGER A 'WESTERN LACKEY'; 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN: WHY HAS KING HUSSEIN BACKED IRAQ? BECAUSE HE BELIEVES SADDAM HUSSEIN IS 
IMPLEMENTING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ARAB UNITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The sudden change in Western assessments of Jordan's King Hussein, from 
favorable to critical in six months, proves once again there are no permanent 
friendships, only permanent interests -- or what, sometimes inaccurately, are 
perceived to be a country's interests. 
</P>
<P>
For years before the Gulf War, then all through its eight years and until early 
this year, King Hussein was, for the West, "the gallant little king," "the wise 
and experienced ruler," "a force for moderation" -- because he did what the 
West approved of. During this period, at different times, for different 
groupings in different Arab countries, he was "the dwarf king," "the Western 
lackey," "the traitor to the Arabs." The Western and the Arab perceptions of 
the king's roles have now been almost reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The West cannot understand why the king has taken such a strongly pro-Iraqi 
line on the Kuwait crisis and why he has become increasingly critical of the 
West. At the same time, his stand is drawing applause from Jordanians and the 
broad masses of the Arab people, if not from their governments. The motivations 
for the king's apparent switch in policies have to be understood. 
</P>
<P>
His support for Iraq now is merely a continuation of the solid and consistent 
support he gave that country all through the Gulf War, which also suited 
Western policies. He did not have to be so wholehearted in his support. He 
could have provided Iraq with arms for cash. He could have allowed the 
transport route from Iraq to Aqaba to be used, for cash, without publicly 
giving Jordan's moral, political, diplomatic and propaganda support. 
</P>
<P>
The king himself frequently explained why: Iraq was defending itself and all 
the Arabs (read Sunni Muslims) against the expansion of Iranian (read Shia 
Persian) territorial ambitions. The Arab sentiment is particularly strong in 
Hussein because he is a Hashemite, a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, 
he personally being the 40th in the line. Mohammed was the prophet of the Arabs 
and the initiator of past greatness. Therefore to be an Arab is a matter of 
tremendous pride to the king. 
</P>
<P>
Until they were driven out in 1924 by the usurping Saud family, the Hashemites 
once ruled Hejaz, the former kingdom where Mecca and Medina are located. From 
Hejaz came the 1914 Arab revolt against the Ottomans, in which the king's 
beloved grandfather, King Abdullah, played a leading role. The core principle 
of that revolt was the assertion of Arab dignity -- that the Arabs should be 
masters of their own destiny and that they should be united as one people. 
</P>
<P>
The king and the Arabs inside and outside Jordan believe, rightly or wrongly, 
that these principles are being implemented by Saddam Hussein's Iraq, 
especially in the Kuwait crisis. But how so, since the Kuwaitis are Arabs and 
Sunni Muslims who stood by Iraq, especially during the Gulf War, especially 
financially? 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis and Jordanians reply that the Kuwaitis and Saudis did nothing more 
than pay protection money, which Iraq had earned by blocking Iranian subversion 
of their populations and expansion into their territories. The depth of 
contempt that modern suit-and-tie Arabs have for the traditional white-robed 
moneybags of the gulf, which the Kuwait crisis brought to the surface, has 
surprised the Arabs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Kuwait, along with its vast wealth went overweening Kuwaiti 
arrogance, displayed toward the expatriates who kept the hydroponic state going 
by manning its essential services. The largest expatriate group was the 
Palestinians, and since Palestinians constitute more than 60% of the Jordanian 
population, Jordan was always rife with anti-Kuwaiti, anti-"Gulfi" sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Hence it was almost inevitable that all groups in the Jordanian Parliament, 
from Communists to the Muslim Brotherhood, should vote unanimous support to the 
king's policy on Kuwait. In a sense, and for the best democratic reasons, he 
had no choice but to support Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The future of King Hussein, the Jordanians and the Palestinians, since they 
have thrown in their lot with Iraq, depends on how the scenario of events 
evolves in the Iraq-U.S. confrontation. If, in the worst case, Iraq goes down 
in defeat with Saddam Hussein dead, Jordan will find itself in a truly 
catastrophic situation. Without Iraq's military backing, Jordan would be 
helpless in the face of an invasion by Israel. There would be no way to stop 
Israel from bringing about an enforced "transfer," as some Israelis call it, of 
the West Bank Palestinians to the East Bank, which could then be designated as 
the Palestinian state while the Hashemites went off into exile. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians have always considered Jordan to be part of southern Syria within 
"Greater Syria." So with the area in confusion, the Syrians could strike a deal 
with the Israelis, giving the Syrians a slice of northern Jordan in 
compensation for the Israelis retaining the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this doomsday plan -- doomsday from the Jordanian point of view -- 
could go seriously awry. One possibility is that the people of the East Bank 
and the West Bank (where Jordanian flags have recently been raised) could rally 
round the king and fight the Israelis to the bitter end. That would be the 
"gallant little king's" personal preference, but there would be heavy 
destruction and heavy casualties on both banks. 
</P>
<P>
In a moderately grim scenario, Saddam Hussein would be eliminated but Iraq 
would not be devastated by U.S. air power. In that case Jordan, as an 
independent entity, could survive, but its main problem would then be 
financial. It would face bankruptcy because it has alienated its main financial 
backers -- Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which, furthermore, would not be willing to 
allow the return of the 400,000 Palestinians whose remittances contributed so 
much to the Jordanian economy. When faced with that utterly desperate prospect, 
economists in Amman have expressed the hope that, besides practicing strict 
austerity at home, Libya has said it would replace the defaulting financiers. 
But Col. Moammar Kadafi is an impulsive and unreliable person. 
</P>
<P>
The best-case scenario for Jordan and Iraq would be something on the lines of 
"the Arab solution," according to which Kuwait would survive as a separate 
entity without the Al Sabah ruling family but linked to Iraq; as of now, this 
seems a hopelessly unrealistic possibility. Yet it might come about if the 
economic burden of the massive U.S. expeditionary force compels Washington to 
moderate its anti-Saddam spleen. In that eventuality, King Hussein and Jordan 
would have been proved right and be rewarded by a "victorious" Iraq. In the 
absence of Palestinian remittances, Saudi Arabia, as a form of insurance, could 
resume some of its aid to the friend of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Seen from the outside, Jordan would seem to be in a perilous and precarious 
position, and yet that is not the feeling within Jordan itself. There the mood 
is one of joyous nihilism: "Because of our frustration caused by the endless 
betrayals of our Western friends, we have chosen the option of honorable Arab 
defiance, and if it brings the roof down on our heads, so be it."

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW;

<P>
ANATOLY SOBCHAK; 
</P>
<P>
TURNING LENINGRAD INTO A REFORM BEACON BY THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alex Alexiev, Alex Alexiev is a senior analyst of Soviet affairs at the RAND 
Corp. He interviewed Anatoly A. Sobchak during the mayor's recent visit to Los 
Angeles to sign a sister- city agreement. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late May, the citizens of Leningrad, by an overwhelming majority, elected 
Anatoly Alexandrovich Sobchak as the new chairman of the Leningrad City 
Council, the top executive position in the great Russian city once known as the 
"Venice of the North." A local paper editorialized that his election marked the 
first time in living memory when "the opinions of the people and those who 
speak on their behalf coincide." Others have seen Sobchak's victory as the 
beginning of the end of Communist rule in Leningrad and, coupled with the 
election of Boris N. Yeltsin as Russia's president and Gavriil Popov as mayor 
of Moscow, as a sign that democracy can no longer be denied to the Russian 
people. Sobchak comes to the mayor's job with solid promise of being able to 
deliver on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Siberian city of Chita 53 years ago and raised in Uzbekistan, he 
began his lifelong association with Leningrad as a student, then as a professor 
of law. The author of 12 scholarly books advocated market reforms in his 
doctoral dissertation, the cause of its rejection for nine years. Until 
recently, he had also refused to join the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak burst onto the national scene as a deputy to the first elected Supreme 
Soviet, gaining national attention through a series of impassioned speeches 
calling for market reforms, political pluralism and the rule of law. In so 
doing, he took on the entire Establishment, including conservatives' hero Yegor 
K. Ligachev, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the military and the KGB. One 
of his stinging criticisms of Ryzhkov, accusing the prime minister of failing 
to implement reform, was castigated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev as "undignified . . 
. tactless and out of place." 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak has also criticized striking miners for breaking the law and urged 
severe punishment for instigators of ethnic rioting. Despite numerous 
detractors in the Establishment and some in the reform movements who consider 
him overly ambitious, Sobchak's popularity has soared. Opinion polls 
consistently rate him one of the most popular personalities in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Since his election, he has presided over the proclamation of Leningrad as a 
free economic zone, conducted separate economic-cooperation negotiations with 
the Baltic republics and threatened to outlaw the Communist Party in the city 
and confiscate its property if it continues to advocate the "dictatorship of 
the proletariat." A call for any dictatorship, argues Sobchak, is a "call for 
violence and the overthrow of the existing system" and will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
This is revolutionary rhetoric. But with Sobchak leading the charge in 
Leningrad and the like-minded Yeltsin doing the same in the Russian republic, 
it is a brave new world in Russia and one that offers real change at long last. 
</P>
<P>
Question: As the new mayor of Leningrad and one of the leading reformers in the 
Soviet Union today, you have become a symbol of the struggle to change the 
ossified Soviet system from below. What are the main obstacles you are facing 
in your efforts to bring about political democracy and a market economy? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Though this may sound odd, the greatest obstacle is not opposition from 
the Communist Party or the hostile bureaucracy but problems within the 
democratic forces -- their general weakness, their inability to unite behind a 
common platform and their lack of experience. Perhaps the main problem is the 
absence of organized democratic parties, which leads to a situation in which 
every deputy speaks on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
This is the case also in Leningrad, despite the fact that we have the most 
democratic City Council in the country and tremendous support from the 
population. A recent poll showed that only 2.5% of Leningrad's population has 
any confidence left in the Communist Party, which is less than the number of 
party members in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Leningrad is a center of the defense industry, with perhaps two-thirds of 
the industrial enterprises engaged in defense-oriented work. How do you propose 
to bring these factories under municipal control? 
</P>
<P>
A: The laws governing a free economic zone stipulate that all enterprises that 
were under state control -- and that includes defense industries -- will be 
transferred to local control. (Defense) industries are currently experiencing 
great difficulties because of large cuts in military orders. Many of them must 
either close down, curtail their production substantially, or start producing 
goods for the civilian market. . . . We have developed a plan to buy such 
factories from the state with the help of new investment banks, which we hope 
would be able to attract foreign capital as well. The objective is not just to 
buy them, but to help them accomplish the necessary restructuring so they can 
become profitable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What sectors of Leningrad's economy do you see as the most attractive and 
potentially profitable for a Western investor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Small business, especially in the service sector. But to achieve the 
privatization of this sector, we would need money . . . our citizens, 
generally, don't have the necessary resources. They would need loans to acquire 
private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
We also have tremendous potential in international tourism. . . . The city has 
tremendous industrial and scientific resources in shipbuilding, space research 
and communications as well. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we would like to refurbish the center of Leningrad, which, though in 
disrepair, has preserved almost all its magnificent 18th-Century architecture. 
We would like to count on international assistance in this effort, since we 
consider our city to be part of the world cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
Q: As you begin refurbishing the city that Peter the Great built, what are the 
chances that it will revert to its historical name and no longer be known as 
the city of Lenin? 
</P>
<P>
A: This is not a pressing issue for us. The process of giving Russian cities 
their old names is well-established. But precipitously changing Leningrad's may 
provoke a violent political reaction from people for whom Lenin is still a 
saint. There is a Russian proverb that is appropriate: "Don't shake the tree 
before the apples are ripe enough to fall." 
</P>
<P>
Q: After staying away from the Communist Party throughout most of your career, 
when membership would have been a definite career advantage, you joined in 
1988, when many already considered it a spent force. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: I wasn't interested in party membership because I knew what was going on 
inside (the party). But after Gorbachev withdrew our troops from Afghanistan, I 
became convinced that radical change is possible. I also knew that without 
change inside the party, a radical transformation of our political system would 
not be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There are many in the West who believe that the economic achievements of 
perestroika have been negligible. Some blame Gorbachev's indecisiveness, 
perhaps caused by his need to maneuver constantly between the conservatives and 
the radicals. Yet Gorbachev has now accepted Yeltsin's blueprint for radical 
economic reform, known as "500 days." Does this mean that the president has 
finally cast his lot with the radicals? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that Gorbachev, as a politician, is a realist and will act as the 
circumstances demand. He now realizes that the economic plans of Ryzhkov and 
(Leonid I.) Abalkin are not realistic and have been rejected by the people and 
life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But why has it taken him so long to realize that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It seems to me that he hoped to change the system with the help of the 
party, and thus assure its staying in power. This is, of course, an illusion, 
but he did entertain such hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Wouldn't Gorbachev's support for Yeltsin be seen by the conservatives as 
final proof of his betrayal of socialism and therefore reason to mobilize 
against the president? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many have believed for a long time that Gorbachev has betrayed socialism, 
but others still trust him. Gorbachev has been the most important guarantee 
against a military takeover, though this danger is receding with each passing 
day. He has also made sure not to alienate important segments of the political 
spectrum. . . . For instance, the Presidential Council is a representative body 
on which all the different political opinions are represented and can make 
their views heard. As an advisory organ, it is not very effective, since 
Gorbachev is smarter and more knowledgeable than any of his so-called advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you believe that the Soviet Union will remain a union and, if so, in what 
form? 
</P>
<P>
A: I do believe that the Soviet Union will remain an union, but in the form of 
a confederation. . . . It will be a confederal state, in which treaties and 
agreements and relations with each of the union republics will be different. 
For instance, relations between the central government and the Baltic republics 
may be based on greater independence for the Balts than those with the Central 
Asian republics. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if some republics -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and so on -- want to 
stay in the union. Would this be in the best interests of the Russian Republic, 
since it probably would have to bear most of the huge economic burden needed to 
alleviate the terrible conditions in such republics? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Kazakhs make up only 28% of the population in Kazakhstan, the Russians 
about 60%. . . . (O)ne should not forget the Russian-speaking populations. It 
is because of this factor that I cannot agree with the notion that it is 
against Russia's interests to have these republics remain in the union. Russia 
cannot build its economy while disregarding the interests of Russians in 
Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Moldavia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yeltsin has developed a very good program for the return of 
the Russians to Russia, especially to its central region, which have been 
abandoned and depopulated. When this program succeeds and the problems with the 
Russian-speaking populations are solved in this way, there will be no 
difficulties with the secession of these republics, if they so desire. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last spring, you were sharply critical of Gorbachev's decision to impose an 
economic blockade on Lithuania. Presently, you are conducting separate 
negotiations on economic cooperation with the Baltic states. What kind of 
relations between the Baltic republics and Leningrad do you envision, 
especially if the former become completely independent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Regardless of the degree of independence the Balts end up having, we should 
have the closest economic relations with them. In the very near future we will 
create a common Baltic market and hope to secure much of our food supplies from 
the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who will participate in this Baltic common market? 
</P>
<P>
A: At first, it will be just Leningrad and the three Baltic republics. But 
later on, Kaliningrad may join, then the Scandinavian countries, Poland and 
Germany. Ultimately, we may even be able to recreate the old Hanseatic League 
of great northern European cities. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several republics have come up with "sovereignty" declarations that go 
beyond claims for jurisdiction over economic and political matters. They want 
republican rights over decision-making on military, even foreign-political 
matters. If this trend should continue, what prerogatives would be left for the 
central government? Could it be said that Gorbachev is becoming a king without 
a kingdom? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. The problem today is that the central government is not pursuing its 
legitimate functions. Gorbachev is presently busy solving such problems as 
distribution of goods. He should not be doing that. Instead, Gorbachev should 
act as an arbiter of conflicts between republics and between the central 
government and republics. For example, the conflict 
</P>
<P>
between Armenia and Azerbaijan is very much Gorbachev's business and he, alone, 
should be responsible for its solution. . . . As the republics acquire 
independence, the role of the president will become more important and more 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if, say, the Ukraine follows up its declaration by not allowing its 
boys to serve outside the republic, or becoming a nuclear-free zone, or setting 
up its own embassies, or joining independent organizations? Will the president 
be able to conduct military or foreign policy effectively? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The statements and declarations being made are not well thought out. They 
stem from a lack of political culture and a lack of understanding that an 
independent army and independent foreign policy for each republic would 
actually do damage to the republics, weakening them and the union. That's why I 
think that this is a temporary phenomenon, a passing affliction. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, questions related to the defense of the country will be 
left to the central government. All other questions -- economic problems, 
internal security, and so on -- will be left to the jurisdiction of the 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening today is that not having independence in areas where they 
really need it, the republics demand total independence, even though, for many 
of them, it would be impractical to have it. In Leningrad, we have a City 
Council and rayon (district) councils. The rayon councils are now demanding 
that we give them the right to distribute land, buildings and other property. 
We are not going to do that. We tell them to take care of their real 
responsibilities -- street and sewer repair, housing maintenance, trade and 
services. The question of land and city property is the proper concern of the 
City Council alone. Jurisdictional conflicts like this are taking place across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What advice would you give President Bush on U.S. policy toward the Soviet 
Union? 
</P>
<P>
A: Bush's policy toward the Soviet Union has been correct. . . . If he were to 
ask my advice, however, I would talk about how American aid and subsidies could 
best be used to help us. This is important, because I do not think that the 
Soviet economy can achieve rapid progress without aid from America and other 
countries, and lack of progress could be very dangerous politically. . . . 
(T)he key problem is how to manage such aid so that it doesn't end in the 
pockets of bureaucrats and only serve to consolidate and strengthen the 
monopoly of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance must be tightly controlled and given only to specific 
people in specific institutions for specific projects. We are ready to present 
such concrete projects and name people and organizations with which Western 
partners should work together. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, we have identified five areas where we could use foreign capital. 
One, the program of privatization, which emphasizes the development of private 
enterprise in trade, the service sector, food industry and so on. Two, 
demilitarization of our industry and the conversion of defense production to 
civilian uses. Three, housing, where we would like to emphasize private 
ownership and the development of a private construction industry. Fourth, in 
attacking the massive ecological problems threatening our city. Last, our 
program to renovate the historical center of the city. In all these programs, 
with the possible exception of the last one, (the return on) Western investment 
could quickly be very profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Western governmental aid must be coordinated with the efforts of private 
entrepreneurs. One of the best solutions would be to set up an investment bank, 
with Western government funds, private capital and funds from the Leningrad 
City Council. Such a joint bank would allow us to work successfully.

America is now taking on the dubious mantle of maintaining the status quo in 
the Arab world that was once the exclusive domain of the leading European 
colonial powers. Due to the diminishing role in the recent past played by these 
same powers, we are now assuming the role of "hired gun" to preserve that old 
order. 
</P>
<P>
For the millions of impoverished Arabs, the rise of Saddam Hussein to military 
and economic power is seen by them as a chance to redress the wrongs so long 
endured. Much as we may deplore the tactics deployed by Hussein, he appears to 
these same Arabs as a charismtic leader. Much in the same tradition of Mao 
Tse-tung, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Ho Chi Minh: leaders in their respective 
countries who threw off repressive foreign domination. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the Saudi and Kuwait governments are hardly the type of regimes that 
the Western world endorses. But that is exactly what we are being asked to 
uphold. Divested of the high-flown rhetoric, principles and lofty ideas, cheap 
Persian Gulf oil is the catalyst that triggers the action we are about to take.

The world should have the determination to tighten the encirclement of Hussein 
by these or similar efforts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somewhere in Egypt, now the beneficiary of $7-billion forgiveness of debt, 
there should be saboteurs capable of stopping the convoys moving vital suplies 
from Aqaba to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somewhere in Saudi Arabia, including the absentee government of Kuwait, 
there must be Kuwaitis who, with minimal instruction, should be capable of 
returning to their homeland and sabotaging the Iraqi occupying forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somewhere, in the rest of the world, Iraq's commercial planes should be 
seized in partial payment of their massive foreign debt, rather than allowing 
them to be used for blatant propaganda purposes as the only egress for European

KOREA DIALOGUE: SLOW BUT STEADY; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION UNCERTAIN, BUT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO KEEP TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To some, there was no progress. To others, some, but not enough. Yet last 
week's meeting between South and North Korea was at least a beginning. Seoul 
and Pyongyang finally opened a dialogue after a 45-year estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The historic talks between Prime Minister Yong Hyon Muk of North Korea and 
Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon of South Korea -- the most senior officials ever 
to meet formally since the peninsula was split in 1945 -- ended without a major 
agreement but on a promising note. There was some compromise, frank discussions 
of their differences and a commitment to continue the dialogue next month. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the meeting even occurred, and in Seoul, was a breakthrough in 
itself. It was uncertain whether Pyongyang would make good on its plans to meet 
with its most hated rival until the very last minute. Then Pyongyang pressed 
for joint entry into the United Nations, an end to joint U.S.-South Korean 
military maneuvers and the release of political prisoners jailed last year for 
their unauthorized visits to the north. Seoul preferred cultural and family 
exchanges and joint economic ventures to build confidence first before future 
discussions on military issues. 
</P>
<P>
They overcame an impasse when Seoul said it would not pursue an application for 
separate entry into the United Nations. In turn, Pyongyang appeared willing to 
resume border talks between Red Cross organizations in the north and south to 
allow humanitarian family exchanges. They had been cut off in protest of joint 
U.S.-South Korean military exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul is right in moving cautiously towards its Communist neighbor. It has 
reason to be mistrustful of North Korea's Kim Il Sung, who started the bloody 
Korean War in 1950. His 42-year Stalinist regime is becoming increasingly 
isolated with the transformation of the Communist world. He agreed to a meeting 
only after the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic ties with South Korean President 
Roh Tae Woo's government. 
</P>
<P>
The capitalist south and Communist north have little in common except for their 
people. Their reconciliation at best will be long and difficult, their 
reunification uncertain.

THIS IS NOT THE BASE TO MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
PENTAGON SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT ITS PLANS TO MOVE EL SEGUNDO AIR FORCE 
FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California invented aerospace and for years could afford to look down its nose 
at out-of-state hustlers trying to pry loose bits of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Times are changing. The Pentagon is talking these days not about closing some 
obsolete cavalry post in California, but of moving a center of excellence in 
the design and deployment of space satellites, a growth industry with a bright 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Satellites can serve as eyes in the sky over flash points like the Persian Gulf 
and other places where regional conflicts are more likely now than clashes 
between the superpowers. They will have a growing role as the means of 
verifying compliance in the arms control agreements that the United States and 
the Soviet Union expect one day will put a formal end to the global nuclear 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, which is in many ways an 
anchor that may well keep some of Southern California's big satellite 
manufacturers from drifting away, is on a list of seven bases that may be moved 
to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The base is home to the Air Force's Space Systems Division, which handles 
satellite procurement for Washington. Another El Segundo operation is the 
Aerospace Corp. whose 4,000 employees provide the research and development 
expertise for decisions on what hardware to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The air base is not on the list because satellite manufacturers are themselves 
moving out, and the space division and the Aerospace Corp. want to stay close 
to them. So the base should be left where it is. 
</P>
<P>
The base made the list because housing and services are so expensive in 
Southern California that it has trouble keeping civilian employees, and 
two-thirds of its military personnel have trouble paying the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Housing shortages are not new to the region. Nor are traffic jams, smog, and 
other results of the volcanic growth that makes Southern California less 
attractive to people than it once was. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Sacramento, our congressional delegation in Washington 
and business leaders have had to think seriously about scrambling to hold onto 
something that always seemed a birthright. 
</P>
<P>
As James Miscoll of the Bank of America, chairman of the Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce, put it: "We can't keep saying we don't have to make deals because in 
California the sun shines every day." 
</P>
<P>
Business and political coalitions are forming to fend off the idea of moving 
the base and to make more housing available for space division workers. 
</P>
<P>
But having rediscovered the virtues of hustling, the region can't stop until it 
learns how to deliver better education, cleaner air and water, more housing and 
the other necessities to offer hope that the future can be as bright as the 
past.

<P>
Saddam Hussein, with the enthusiastic support of his people, is causing the 
civilized world billions of dollars in defense and related expenditures. 
Starting with the first day of the invasion of Kuwait the American people have 
been forced to pay higher prices for gasoline, and within a short time other 
goods and services were more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Our taxes will reflect the military expenditures for this insane adventure of 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
It would only seem fair that the United Nations seek reimbursement so that all 
its members can be paid for the proportionate share of this project. Iraq is 
one of the largest oil-producing countries. After a successful conclusion, the 
American people and their allies should see concrete evidence as a result of 
Iraq's reparations in lower gasoline prices and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
We should contact President Bush, our congressmen and U.S. senators at this 
time to make plans for reimbursement to the American people and the entire 
civilized world.

Our presence in Saudi Arabia is costing us a lot of money, obviously much more 
than we can readily afford. 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion as to who should pay the cost. It is Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq probably has $200 billion or more of assets that are available to us. The 
money we should use immediately for our daily expense, and other assets we 
should prepare to sell. 
</P>
<P>
We have been too good to the Iranians, and will probably, eventually, give back 
to them the billions we have seized. 
</P>
<P>
But it's time to get really tough with this ruffian. Make him understand that 
every day he postpones getting out of Kuwait, he is frittering away his assets.

What in the world can you say to something like that? My first reaction is that 
it's hyperbole that comes out of Alice in Wonderland or as (marijuana

</P>
<P>
Over the years, drug policy has widened its net of who moves into the criminal 
category, so that more and more U.S. citizens are pulled into criminal 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The question was what severity of criminal sanctions is going to produce the 
necessary result.

What this one does for people who are not committed drug-users is to move them 
into criminal categories that (Gates) says are equal to treason. What it does 
is place the government at war with its citizens -- for the most part citizens 
not at war with their government. 
</P>
<P>
Their behavior for the most part is recreational and ought to be outside the 
whole scope of what is considered criminal.

CRYONICS: FREEZING BODIES FOR LATER, UH, REANIMATION GAINS POPULARITY. BUT 
RESURRECTION IS NOT WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS.

<P>
To date, 26 people have been cryonically suspended -- frozen for the future -- 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, 24 of them are in California, where the urge to live forever is 
beginning to look like a serious business. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are still tiny. And cryonics, an ad hoc science that was born with 
the icy suspension of a Glendale physician in 1967, still faces some daunting 
questions about its practicality and legal status. 
</P>
<P>
After 23 years on the fringe, however, cryonics is clearly evolving from cult 
phenomenon into California's latest -- and perhaps most troubled -- growth 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in cryonics societies is rising sharply, thanks partly to publicity 
from a cryonics-related homicide investigation in Riverside three years ago and 
from the more recent request by a Silicon Valley mathematician to be frozen 
before his death. (Cryonicists hope to preserve themselves until science can 
find a way to revive them.) 
</P>
<P>
At Riverside's Alcor Foundation, for instance, membership has tripled to 590 
since 1987. "1990 has blown us away. . . . If we keep going at anywhere near 
this rate, things are going to change radically around here," says Alcor 
President Carlos Mondragon. 
</P>
<P>
The sign-up boom -- and the prospect that some groups will receive 
multimillion-dollar inheritances as the first generation of aging cryonics 
advocates begins to die -- has sparked entrepreneurial vigor, as well as new 
problems, in the field that itself nearly expired in 1976. That's when the 
Cryonics Society of California suffered financial collapse and several bodies 
were allowed to thaw. 
</P>
<P>
Some new-wave cryonicists are unabashedly commercializing their activities in 
the belief that cryonics, like the biotechnology and computer industries, will 
achieve key technological breakthroughs only when big investors begin to smell 
profit in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Once people found out you could make money using genetic technology, the thing 
just steamrolled. . . . Now, the commercialization of cryonics is occurring. 
The companies are beginning to amass respectable capital," says Paul Segall, a 
Berkeley-based medical researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he helped found Cryomedical Sciences Inc., a publicly traded company 
that is seeking medical applications for organ-freezing techniques developed by 
cryonics enthusiasts like himself. 
</P>
<P>
Others are grappling with some weird questions of personal finance that arise 
when, largely outside conventional legal structures, you try to take your money 
with you. "If you think (cryonics) might work, the question is not only will 
you be restored in the future, but will you have any resources at that time," 
explains 51-year-old cryonics activist Saul Kent. In 1987, Kent became 
embroiled in a homicide investigation after his mother Dora's head was frozen 
-- the preferred term for heads-only preservation is "neurosuspension" -- and 
the Riverside County coroner determined that her body was suffused with a 
lethal dose of barbiturate. 
</P>
<P>
(It is cheaper to preserve just a head, and some cryonicists believe it 
advantageous, since they expect science to devise new bodies by cloning or 
another technique in the future.) 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Alcor, which performed the suspension, maintained that the drug 
was administered after death, and the investigation was eventually suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Kent, who acknowledges that the resulting publicity boosted Alcor's membership, 
is now preoccupied with developing IRAs: individual reanimation accounts. They 
promise investors fanciful returns (see chart) in 100 years or more on money 
that will be moved, through a Liechtenstein foundation, to a Swiss bank. And 
they are only the latest twist in a business that is virtually unregulated 
because authorities have been reluctant to put an implied stamp of approval on 
what may prove to be just a silly attempt to cheat death. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, cryonics has been in legal limbo since state health officers two years 
ago stopped issuing death certificates for frozen corpses and asked the 
district attorney in Riverside to prosecute Alcor for disposing of human 
remains without a license. Alcor sued the state health department and has 
continued to perform suspensions -- arguing that it would seek a cryonics 
license if any state agency offered one. Meanwhile, prosecutors have withheld 
action pending a decision on the matter from a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a hole in the law," concedes California Deputy Atty. Gen. Y. Tammy 
Chung, who is handling the state's defense against the Alcor suit. 
</P>
<P>
Though generally wary of authority, cryonicists have often been even warier of 
each other since the 1976 meltdown, known among initiates as the "Chatsworth 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a financial debacle, four bodies maintained at a Chatsworth 
storage facility were allowed to thaw, and a Los Angeles jury eventually 
entered a $1-million fraud award against CSC and its companion Cryonic 
Interment Inc., both now defunct. 
</P>
<P>
That helped to persuade cryonics advocates that nothing -- except, perhaps, 
body-damaging autopsies requested by nosy insurance examiners -- was to be 
feared more than financial instability. 
</P>
<P>
Many cryonicists now believe that the prospect of healthy, long-term profits 
will be the best incentive for future generations to maintain their bodies 
across time. "I don't think altruism alone will do it," says Arthur Quaife, 
president of Trans-Time Inc., a commercial cryonics company that is housed in 
an industrial zone near the Oakland airport. 
</P>
<P>
Trans-Time, small and closely held by Quaife and others, raised about $1 
million in fresh capital last year by spinning off organ-freezing technology to 
Cryomedical Sciences in return for stock. Cryomedical, based in Bethesda, Md., 
has no significant sales now. But its backers envision enormous profits if it 
can find a way to chill human organs for transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Trans-Time insiders, meanwhile, say their company contemplates further 
spin-offs, or even a public stock sale of its own, to raise capital for new 
quarters, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
According to Quaife, the company has made a small profit from fees for its 
eight suspensions to date but still loses money on long-term maintenance. He 
hopes to remedy that situation as economies of scale, helped along lately by 
the lucrative sideline of freezing pets for up to $16,000 each, bring storage 
costs down. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, preservation is a pricey proposition, largely because each 
"cryonaut" must set aside enough capital to pay for maintenance indefinitely 
out of interest alone. 
</P>
<P>
Trans-Time's current minimums for preservation arranged through the American 
Cryonics Society, a nonprofit group based in Cupertino, are $45,000 for "neuro" 
-- head only -- and $125,000 for a whole body. Alcor, working with a commercial 
adjunct called Cryovita Laboratories, provides similar services for $35,000 and 
$100,000, though prices at both facilities are scheduled to rise shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, a Canadian group will bury you in the Arctic for as little as 
$5,000, but many cryonics advocates believe the permafrost just isn't cold 
enough for reliable long-term preservation. In Michigan, the Cryonics Institute 
is maintaining two bodies for less by relying heavily on volunteer labor, 
though some cryonics professionals are skeptical of their staying power. "You 
might as well pick a grave site," says one. 
</P>
<P>
In a whole body suspension, roughly 30% of the payment is applied to initial 
processing. The two facilities quibble about technique, but both use heart-lung 
resuscitators and other equipment to wash the blood out of a corpse and 
"perfuse" it with a fluid designed to protect organs against damage from 
extreme cold. Then the corpse is frozen at minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit in a 
container, or "dewar," of liquid nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
(Cryonicists acknowledge that the suspension process creates problems of its 
own. "Between the temperature of the body (and) liquid nitrogen, we probably 
are causing extensive freezing damage," says Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham, president of 
ACS. Generally, ice crystals inside of each cell expand, destroying membranes 
and other cell structures. Cryonicists hope perfusion with glucose and glycerol 
will limit such damage enough to permit eventual revival.) 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the payment is deposited with Alcor, ACS or some other caretaker 
entity to be invested on the "patient's" behalf at a rate presumably sufficient 
to beat inflation and cover costs of annual storage and liquid nitrogen 
replacements -- $4,500 at Trans-Time and just $1,700 at apparently more 
efficient Alcor. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred means of paying for the service is a life insurance policy naming 
the cryonics organization as beneficiary. Such policies pay off quickly with 
little danger of interference from frustrated would-be heirs and can be 
purchased by, say, a 30-year-old for only $60 a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
But the insurance connection has also fed one of the more controversial 
financial practices in cryonics. 
</P>
<P>
Until earlier this year, 21-year-old ACS -- California's oldest cryonics 
organization -- maintained recruiting arrangements that gave exclusive sign-up 
rights in California to James Yount of Cupertino, and in the rest of the world 
to Irving Rand, of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Both are insurance brokers, and each openly treated persons who inquired about 
cryonics as prospects for insurance policies. In addition, Rand charged paper 
work fees of up to $1,500 for processing new members, on top of the society's 
$1,000 entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
After a leadership shake-up that began last year, ACS severed its ties with 
Rand and scrapped the up-front charges. Yount became the organization's 
secretary under the new regime and continues to recruit, but says he doesn't 
sell insurance to any prospective member now that he's an officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not take as a client anyone who comes in via ACS. Because of conflict of 
interest, I do not," he said, while conceding that the previous arrangements 
discouraged all but a few prospects from enlisting with ACS. 
</P>
<P>
Rand says his arrangement was a fair trade for footing the cost of ACS's "800" 
number. He also argues that cryonics will only come into its own when 
soft-headed enthusiasts, many of them Silicon valley professionals with science 
and technical background, become more comfortable with capitalist realities. 
</P>
<P>
"Cryonics is my passion, insurance is my business," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Segall and some others who drifted away from ACS after the internal 
shake-up, Rand earlier this year founded the International Cryonics Foundation, 
based in Stockton. Once again, he is in charge of recruiting and is currently 
approaching cemeteries and mortuaries, looking for alliances that will give 
cryonics added vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, death itself is already boosting the societies, as first-generation 
advocates begin to "deanimate," often having committed substantial estates to 
their organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor apparently reaped the first major bequest when television writer-producer 
Dick Clair ("The Carol Burnett Show") died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Clair left two wills, one of which named the foundation as his principal heir, 
and placed no restrictions on his bequest. After a costly legal battle with 
other would-be heirs, Alcor reached a settlement giving it TV show residuals of 
perhaps $2 million over 10 years, as well as about $500,000 cash and title to 
Clair's North Hollywood home, valued at about $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
For Alcor, it was enough to fund staff positions and equipment purchases that 
are the envy of its northern rivals. The next step will be to find seed money 
for a planned new facility, which is likely to become a major selling point as 
Alcor competes with ACS and Trans-Time for sign-ups. 
</P>
<P>
At ACS, meanwhile, officers estimate that half of the group's 102 suspension 
members have committed all their wealth, totaling tens of millions of dollars, 
for management by the society, which generally promises to invest the funds for 
research and patient care and to return any balance to the members upon 
"reanimation." 
</P>
<P>
While eager for fresh funds, cryonicists also fear the bequests will attract 
unscrupulous operators who might seize a society's assets by purchasing a 
controlling number of memberships, or will trigger closer official scrutiny of 
the various groups' finances. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get up to more than one (suspension) a month," says ACS Treasurer John 
Day, "the money will grow to the point where it will attract government 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Cryonicists believe that legal scrutiny, if it comes, is likely to focus on the 
"rule against perpetuities," a common law principle that strictly limits the 
duration of personal financial arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
In short, you can't control your money forever. But cryonicists keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
At ACS, suspension customers have tried to sidestep the rule by establishing 
individual charitable trusts, which are not limited in duration. A key purpose 
of each trust is the maintenance and eventual reanimation of the cryonicist's 
body -- a charitable cause that even devotees believe will someday receive 
close examination by California's attorney general, the "super-guardian" of all 
trusts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor, founded as a nonprofit foundation in 1972 by a group of CSC dropouts, 
simply executes a contract to care for its bodies indefinitely, and pools its 
care funds for management by an investment committee appointed by the 
foundation's board. The preferred investment of the moment is U.S. Treasury 
bills, according to 34-year-old Mondragon, a former financial analyst who 
became Alcor's chief executive in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even some close Alcor allies are less than satisfied with Alcor's financial 
arrangements, however. "There's nothing in those contracts that indicates 
you're ever going to get a penny back -- because they can't do it" due to the 
rule against perpetuities and other strictures, says cryonicist Kent, one of 
the foundation's most active members. 
</P>
<P>
Kent, not surprisingly, recommends investment in his foundation, which promises 
to place the investor's funds with the Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, 
because of its presumed solidity, and to hold it, forever if necessary, under 
Liechtenstein law. The foundation has chosen the tiny European principality 
because, according to Kent's research, it numbers with the Turk and Caicos 
Islands in the Caribbean and Nauru in the South Pacific as one of three places 
where the rule against perpetuities doesn't hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's really necessary," UCLA law professor Robert McGowan says 
of the Liechtenstein ploy. McGowan, who is not associated with any cryonics 
organization, points out that South Dakota and Wisconsin, for instance, have 
virtually abolished the rule and are more easily reached by contributors trying 
to enforce their own rights. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Kent acknowledges that he hasn't worked out the tax consequences 
of a bequest to oneself -- a problem that could be considerable if a reanimated 
investor were to awaken with, as he predicts, billions of dollars in 
accumulated interest. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll come back to tax problems. The government's going to say, 'That's very 
nice -- here's what you owe,' " warns Lance Brofman, a New York municipal bond 
fund manager. 
</P>
<P>
Brofman offers a solution, however: His own Cryonic Asset Trust, which he plans 
to market in association with the fledgling ICF. He claims already to have 
contacted the New York state legislature about an exemption from the rule 
against perpetuities, and figures that tax-free municipals will prove the best 
investment for a future that may test the staying power of even the biggest 
industrial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Most likely, the State of California, the City of Los Angeles, is going to be 
around 500 years from now," he advises. "But IBM . . . who knows?"

NUCLEAR INDUSTRY TRIES TO MAKE A COMEBACK; 
</P>

ENERGY: DESPITE SOARING OIL PRICES, THE OUTLOOK FOR NEW PLANTS IS BLEAK. BUT 
THE INDUSTRY SEES SEVERAL HELPFUL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE HORIZON.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices soaring, America's nuclear 
power industry was on the offensive. Its advertising, already scheduled to run 
in several national magazines, showed a menacing cobra whose body was made of 
oil drums. The message: Continued U.S. reliance on foreign oil is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraqi tanks crossed the border, the U.S. industry was ready. Within two 
weeks, the ad campaign was expanded to 18 major daily newspapers, at a cost of 
$150,000. But the extra spending -- and the discomfort of rising oil prices -- 
marked only a small and temporary blip in the $6-million-a-year media campaign 
by the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness, an arm of the nuclear power industry, 
to revive the long-dormant business of building power reactors. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than rely on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, suppliers of nuclear power 
are placing their bets on longer-term hopes: continued steady growth in 
electricity demand and new designs for reactors that are cheaper to build and 
easier to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is pretty much 'steady as she goes,' " said council spokesman Carl 
Goldstein. Indeed, analysts say, there may be no other viable strategy for an 
industry that hasn't received a new construction permit since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power provides 19.5% of the nation's electricity. But these days the 
industry makes its domestic profits doing repairs and maintenance on existing 
plants rather than designing and constructing new ones. 
</P>
<P>
There are 114 operating plants, but only nine under construction -- and only 
two of those have firm completion dates. "There simply are no more in the 
pipeline," said Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. "We suspect several of (the plants under construction) may never 
get finished." Meanwhile, Ingram noted, the agency is concentrating on making 
sure that existing reactors run safely. 
</P>
<P>
The major reason that the utility industry has shunned new orders for reactors 
is that it simply takes too long -- usually a decade or more -- before a 
utility can win final approval from regulators to begin operating a new nuclear 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective customers for nuclear power plants do "not trust the regulatory 
system on (both) the state and federal levels," said Goldstein of the Council 
on Energy Awareness, whose membership consists of utility companies, equipment 
manufacturers and builders of power plants. "They have no confidence that if 
they make investment decisions, these will be supported when the plant is 
built," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in many areas, state regulatory bodies are prohibiting utilities from 
increasing their prices to help pay for nuclear power plants, effectively 
forcing them to take the construction costs out of their profits. During the 
1980s, the amount of construction costs that public utility commissions refused 
to include in rate-setting totaled a staggering $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nation's appetite for electricity keeps rising -- it has jumped 
54% in just seven years -- the future of nuclear power looks comparatively 
bleak. 
</P>
<P>
California, with nearly 30 million people the nation's biggest state, gets 14% 
of its electricity from nuclear power plants, but prospects are virtually nil 
that more will be built there. State law forbids licensing of new plants until 
there is a demonstrated safe method of disposing of nuclear waste. And the 
federal Energy Department isn't expected to complete its work on waste disposal 
methods and site selection until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see nuclear power representing a viable option in the foreseeable 
future," said Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the waste-disposal problem is solved, the high cost of building nuclear 
power plants -- and lingering questions about their reliability -- still pose 
massive obstacles, Imbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power "commands an enormous amount of capital over a long period of 
time and is simply not going to attract customers" unless the technology 
becomes more competitive, he said. If it has any future at all, he asserted, it 
lies with smaller-sized plants -- not the behemoths that were built in the 
1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Imbrecht insisted that California's diverse sources of power -- from natural 
gas, underground steam fields, hydroelectric power and purchases of electricity 
from other regions -- have made the state less vulnerable to foreign 
interruptions. Only 1% of California's electricity is generated by oil, down 
from a whopping 48% during the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the United States. 
There is "absolutely no danger of the lights going out in California any time 
this decade," Imbrecht asserted. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, even nuclear power enthusiasts don't foresee any easy expansion. 
"Clearly, we favor nuclear power," said Tom Dennis, Southern California 
Edison's Washington representative. The company's nuclear power plant at San 
Onofre "has a great record," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis said Southern California Edison has been bullish on nuclear power, "and 
we think it can work." But he conceded that even the crisis in the Persian Gulf 
won't move Congress to ease the licensing process. "I doubt any fast-tracking 
will be done as a result of what takes place in the Middle East," he said. "I 
don't think the crisis will result in anything but a clearer recognition that 
there needs to be a national energy policy." 
</P>
<P>
Strategists at the Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. say they believe that the 
United States needs both coal and nuclear power to meet its future energy 
needs. But Herb Woodeshick, special assistant to the company's president, said 
it would take major regulatory reforms to persuade the nation's utility 
industry to construct new plants. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: A one-step licensing process to replace the separate construction 
and operating permits now required, resolution of the waste-disposal issue and 
a standard new design for nuclear plants. "When someone starts to build a 
plant, you need to be sure it can be done in six or seven years," Woodeshick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With even its friends still reluctant, the nuclear power industry recognizes 
that it is unlikely to make a comeback any time soon, even in the face of the 
gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our campaign is consistent, our message is clear -- that imported oil is 
dangerous," Goldstein said. "Fortuitously, our latest series of ads fit right 
into the world situation." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein emphasized that, every day, nuclear power displaces the use of 
740,000 barrels of oil in producing electricity -- about the same amount that 
the United States imported from Iraq and Kuwait before the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Only 6% of America's electricity is generated by burning oil, but almost 20% of 
total generating capacity is oil-fired, he warned. "If utilities had no other 
choice but to use this spare capacity," he said, "oil consumption could shoot 
up as much as 3 million barrels a day." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's pessimism, there are some changes on the way: 
</P>
<P>
* Analysts expect that a new generation of nuclear reactors -- a standard 
design that would be far less complex and easier to operate -- will be 
certified by 1994, or possibly sooner. 
</P>
<P>
* The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has adopted a proposal recommending a 
single-permit procedure to replace the current two-step system. But industry 
officials believe that they will need new legislation to make the procedural 
changes unassailable to challenges, and Congress is likely to balk at such a 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
* The industry hopes to wage its future public relations battles partly on 
environmental grounds, arguing that nuclear energy is clean and emits no 
"greenhouse gases." "Our polls show environmental concerns are more telling 
than energy issues," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
If the industry is politically skillful -- and lucky -- utilities may be 
ordering new plants by the middle of the decade, Goldstein suggested. 
</P>
<P>
But an air of pessimism still prevails. A publishing and economic consulting 
company has scheduled a conference in Washington later this month on the theme 
of standardization of nuclear power plants. "Can it save the nuclear industry?" 
the program asks.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: STOP PROCRASTINATING; PLAN NOW FOR TAX SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Labor Day has passed, summer is over. It's time to stop procrastinating and 
focus on how to reduce your tax bill come April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, you have more than three months before year-end. But Christmas is too 
late to start planning tax-saving strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Congress has not performed any major surgery on tax laws this past 
year, so the steps you used last year generally still apply, says Edward 
Rosenson, tax partner in the Century City office of Ernst &amp; Young, the 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Basic planning is not a whole lot different," Rosenson says. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a checklist of year-end tax strategies you can consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Defer income. By shifting income from this year to next, taxes on it won't be 
due until 1992. Consider buying Treasury bills, short-term certificates of 
deposit or other investment vehicles whose interest won't be paid until 1991. 
Ask your employer to defer bonuses or other supplemental pay. If you are 
self-employed, consider delaying billing your clients until January. If you are 
selling real estate, consider an installment sale allowing you to receive 
payments into the future. One caution: Deferring income could backfire if tax 
rates are significantly raised next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Accelerate expenses. Pushing deductions into this year can generate more 
deductions sooner, thus reducing your taxable income. Such an outcome is 
especially useful if you expect your income to decline next year, you are 
retiring or you plan to stop moonlighting. 
</P>
<P>
Make your mortgage payment, ordinarily due in January, in December instead. 
Prepay your state estimated tax and property tax. 
</P>
<P>
The same caution applies, however: Accelerating expenses may backfire if tax 
rates are significantly increased next year. That would make your deductions 
more valuable next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Bunch expenses. There are some expenses you may not want to accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
Take miscellaneous expenses -- including certain employee business costs, 
magazine subscriptions, union and professional dues, investment and financial 
planning fees. They are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of 
your adjusted gross income. Medical expenses are deductible only to the extent 
that they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, estimate how much of these expenses you are likely to incur this 
year. If you're unlikely to exceed those thresholds this year, consider 
postponing expenses until next year. Conversely, if you will exceed those 
thresholds, accelerate expenses that you would have incurred next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Maximize contributions to retirement plans. Put the maximum into your 401(k) 
company savings plan. It's arguably the best tax-deferral vehicle around, in 
part because companies typically match employee contributions by up to 50%. You 
can contribute up to $7,979 this year. 
</P>
<P>
And if you are planning to contribute to your individual retirement account or 
Keogh plan, start doing so now. Don't wait until April 15. You'll get more time 
to accumulate tax-deferred earnings. 
</P>
<P>
* Reduce your non-mortgage debt. Only 10% of interest paid this year on car 
loans, credit cards and other non-mortgage debt is deductible (that falls to 
zero next year). Considering that credit card debt is so expensive, with 
interest charges as high as 21%, it makes sense to reduce plastic debt. 
</P>
<P>
One way is through a home equity loan or credit line. Interest on loans of up 
to $100,000 is fully deductible. But be careful. If you default on a home 
equity loan, you could lose your house. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan your charitable contributions. If you have assets such as stock that 
have appreciated in value, plan to give those instead of cash. That way you'll 
avoid paying capital gains tax. (If you still like the stock, you can buy it 
again at the same, higher price, increasing the cost basis upon which future 
capital gains taxes will be calculated.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, as another alternative to giving cash, consider giving old furniture, 
books and other garage or attic items. In many cases, you can deduct their fair 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
If you pay quarterly estimated taxes, consider making charitable contributions 
now. That way you might generate deductions sooner to reduce income subject to 
estimated tax. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan your capital gains and losses. It's often a bad idea to buy or sell 
assets solely on tax considerations. But if you have some big losers from the 
stock market, and have other assets on which you'll pay big capital gains tax, 
consider whether it makes sense to sell the losers to generate capital losses. 
Those losses can be used to offset capital gains dollar for dollar. Also, up to 
$3,000 of capital losses per year can be used to offset ordinary income from 
wages and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider gifts to children. The best thing is to give assets that will 
appreciate in value, such as growth stocks or real estate. That shifts capital 
gains taxes to the youngsters, who presumably are in a lower tax bracket. It 
also reduces the size of your estate potentially subject to estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
You can give up to $10,000 per recipient per year, free of gift taxes. Congress 
has been considering limiting the total amount you can give, free of gift 
taxes, to $30,000 per year to all recipients. It's far from certain that such a 
provision will be enacted. But to play it safe, you might want to make gifts 
now instead of later, Rosenson suggests. 
</P>
<P>
* Look at tax-free or tax-deferred investments. In a high tax bracket and need 
more tax-free income? Consider such investments as municipal bonds, 
tax-deferred annuities and Series EE savings bonds. And California may soon 
offer tax-free bonds with face values as low as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Adjust your withholding. If you got a big tax refund last year, adjust your 
withholding to eliminate it. That refund was a big interest-free loan to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Also, adjust your withholding if your situation was changed by marriage or 
divorce, a new job, a baby or a new home.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: EQUITIES ARE PART OF A BALANCED FINANCIAL DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Dow Jones industrial index drops 10% in a single month, as it did in 
August, it can be tough to persuade people to invest in stocks or stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
It can be especially difficult trying to persuade anybody who's nearing 
retirement age. Most retirees live on a fixed income, so they can't afford 
losses. Besides, folks in their early 60s or older remember the stock market 
crash of 1929 and the economic devastation that followed. This explains why a 
lot of people in these age groups have a natural bias against equity 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the risks, most people planning for retirement should have some 
stock market holdings, financial experts say. And the reason can be summed up 
in one word: inflation. "Most people ignore the inflation risk," says Brian 
Roehl, an academic consultant at Educational Technologies Inc., a Troy, Mich., 
firm that conducts retirement-planning seminars for corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, inflation diminishes the purchasing power of everybody, not just 
retirees. But anyone on a fixed income will likely feel the impact severely. 
"People benefit from inflation in that their salaries increase over the years," 
notes Bruce Grenke, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors in Walnut Creek, 
Calif. "When you retire, that advantage ends." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Social Security and company pension plans go a long ways toward 
fulfilling retirement needs. But most people can't depend on these sources to 
meet all their financial requirements. "As a general rule, pension plans and 
Social Security will pay 50% of the retirement needs for a typical person," 
Roehl estimates. 
</P>
<P>
While that percentage will vary according to individual circumstances, most 
people need to tap their savings and investments to defray at least part of 
their living expenses upon retirement. To build up an adequate nest egg, stock 
market holdings are your best long-term choice. 
</P>
<P>
That's because fixed-income instruments such as bonds, money market accounts 
and certificates of deposit have historically returned just slightly more than 
the inflation rate. From 1965 through 1989, for example, long-term government 
bonds returned about 6.7% a year, compounded, but only about 0.9% annually when 
inflation is factored in, according to Ibbotson Associates of Chicago. During 
much of the '60s and '70s, bonds were unable to keep up with inflation, as the 
accompanying chart shows. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, common stocks, as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, 
returned 10.2% annually (4.3% a year when adjusted for inflation) the last 25 
years. Even if you exclude the high-flying '80s, stocks have averaged about a 
9% nominal and 6% real annual return dating back to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Though there's no guarantee that similar results will be seen in the '90s and 
beyond, the more time you have to invest, the better your odds of succeeding 
with an equity strategy. Many people nearing retirement feel that they have to 
play it safe because they don't have much time to make up any losses. However, 
a person turning 60 today can expect to live to 85 or so, Roehl points out. 
"That means he has 25 more years to be invested in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Some investment advisers pursue an aggressive, equity-oriented strategy for all 
of their clients, young and old alike. Norman L. Yu, a Newport Beach money 
manager, restricts his purchases to high-growth stocks, many of which show 
above-average volatility. "Our clients range in age from the low 40s to the 
70s, and they're all in the same type of program," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Like many money managers, Yu generally accepts accounts of $100,000 or more. 
For people with less to invest, he suggests sticking with a well-managed growth 
stock fund. And rather than worry about volatility, he urges investors to 
exploit periods of market weakness by purchasing additional shares. In fact, he 
believes that, following the heavy selling in August, stocks are positioned for 
a strong rally later this year and in 1991 -- an upswing he thinks will take 
the Dow past 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Grenke isn't so optimistic. Nevertheless, he recommends at least some equity 
holdings for just about everybody, at all times. For a person in or approaching 
retirement, he suggests placing even amounts of money in four areas: stocks, 
bonds, cash and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Grenke likes the Evergreen Total Return Fund (no load; 800-235-0064) for the 
stock portion, and either Vanguard's Short-Term Corporate Bond portfolio (no 
load; 800-662-7447) or Fidelity's Intermediate Bond fund (no load; 
800-544-6666) in the fixed-income category. Money-market funds, certificates of 
deposit or Treasury bills all can work for the cash component, he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you own a home, Grenke suggests that you don't need any more real estate 
holdings. Otherwise, you could purchase a real estate mutual fund or real 
estate investment trusts (REITs), a type of stock market investment. At the 
moment, he's not making such recommendations since the real estate industry has 
been hurting so much lately. 
</P>
<P>
Roehl advocates a similar asset-allocation strategy. For investors within a few 
years of retirement, he suggests an equal mix among stocks, bonds and cash. For 
those planning to keep working several more years, he recommends 50% in 
equities and 25% in the other two categories. Only for retired people past 70 
does he advise forsaking stocks in favor of a 50-50 mix of bonds and cash. 
</P>
<P>
Roehl further suggests that you readjust your portfolio once a year to bring it 
back to its original composition. For example, if the bond market has rallied 
the past year while stock prices have fallen, you would sell some of your bond 
fund shares and add money to the equity fund. This is an automatic buy-low, 
sell-high strategy, he says, and an approach that does a bit better than a 
simple buy-and-hold discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no investment approach makes sense it if causes you to lose sleep at 
night. Unless you have an unwavering tolerance for risk, you probably would 
have trouble handling an all-equity strategy. But a retirement-oriented 
allocation that includes perhaps a 25% to 33% weighting in stocks or stock 
funds can provide growth potential without exposing your entire portfolio to 
excessive risk. 
</P>
<P>
Grenke sees a parallel between a well-rounded portfolio and a balanced diet. An 
asset mix that includes equities, bonds, cash and real estate meets all the 
nutritional minimums. "It's like the four basic food groups," he says. "You 
need a bit of each." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STOCKS AND BONDS: THE REAL STORY 
</P>
<P>
It's not what you make that counts but what you keep. That axiom is often used 
to describe the tax bite, but it also says plenty about the impact of 
inflation. The following chart shows the after-inflation, or "real," returns 
for common stocks, as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, and for 
bonds (long-term U.S. governments) from 1965 through 1989. All results are 
compounded and include reinvested dividends and interest, as compiled by 
Ibbotson Associates of Chicago. Note that stocks fared much better against 
inflation than bonds over this period.,

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I would greatly appreciate any information you can give me on Control Data 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
I've held this stock for several years because of information in the firm's 
annual report about reorganizations and other efforts to raise profitability. 
It is difficult for me to understand how the information in the annual report 
can be correct, while the company is not paying dividends and the price of the 
stock continues to fall. -- Jamestown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A: The headline of a recent Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. report about Control Data 
is: "Like Watching Paint Dry." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Frumberg, the analyst who follows the computer company, admits that 
Control Data has been "a war of attrition for investors" who've been waiting 
for an upturn in earnings. But he thinks that good things are about to happen 
for all of you patient shareholders, so he is recommending that clients buy the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Frumberg says the firm's businesses are starting to improve, which might allow 
Control Data to embark on a restructuring that could come in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A restructuring, Frumberg predicts, could give Control Data stock a boost. 
</P>
<P>
But before the company can buy back some of its own stock as part of any 
restructuring, the analyst says, it will have to obtain some debt relief. It 
will probably also want to sell its 10 million shares of Seagate Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Frumberg thinks Control Data will earn $1.25 a share this year. That compares 
to a loss of more than $16 a share in 1989. The Institutional Brokers Estimate 
System at Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan says the average estimate of all analysts who 
follow the company is $1.27 a share -- close to Frumberg's figure. The highest 
estimate is $1.50 a share, the lowest $1. 
</P>
<P>
Says Frumberg: "If someone was ever going to own this stock, now is the time to 
own it. The earnings are now becoming substantial, and a restructuring is 
imminent." 
</P>
<P>
Q: When World War II ended, I bought some Russian bonds that dated back to 
1916, 1919 and 1921. I paid 10 cents on the dollar. I'd like to know their 
value today. Will the new regime in Russia make good on the bonds, or do I have 
a better chance of winning the lottery? -- Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: The bonds are probably worth zilch today. But there is hope. 
</P>
<P>
At the economic summit in Houston earlier this year, the United States 
disclosed that it was negotiating to resolve financial claims with Russia 
dating back to the czar. 
</P>
<P>
Britain struck such a deal in 1986. The Russians agreed to pay off czarist 
bonds that were repudiated after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Bondholders got 
about 10 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past few years, the Russians have coughed up more money, according 
to Robert Fisher, vice president of R. M. Smythe in New York. British holders 
of czarist bonds have now gotten back about one-third of what is owed them. 
</P>
<P>
Keep the faith. But it probably wouldn't hurt to play the lottery anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Q: While I was at an airport in Pittsburgh, I came across the enclosed brochure 
for a investment product handled by a firm called ELCOA. It claims to pay an 
effective annual rate of 10.58% on a six-month investment. Can you tell me more 
about this type of investment? What are the risks, and how secure is ELCOA? 
Venice, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A: What ELCOA is doing is simple. 
</P>
<P>
ELCOA stands for Equipment Leasing Corp. of America. The company will take your 
investment and that of thousands of other people and buy equipment -- 
everything from fax machines to lathes -- which it then leases out. The ELCOA 
offering is handled by an investment firm called Welco Securities Inc. of Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I did was check out Welco. The National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers in Washington says it had a minor problem with the company in 1986, but 
otherwise it appears to be clean. 
</P>
<P>
I then spoke with a Welco salesman, without identifying myself as a reporter. 
He said the ELCOA fund invests one-third of its money in office equipment, 
one-third in light commercial equipment and the rest in restaurant equipment. 
He said defaults on its leases have been running at about 2.75% a year. 
</P>
<P>
The salesman pooh-poohed the idea that a recession could cause the default rate 
to skyrocket and the investment's return to plunge. "If you are talking 
depression, with thousands of businesses folding, then there's a risk," he 
finally conceded. 
</P>
<P>
But I wonder how many restaurants will be returning refrigerators, and how many 
office computers will be returned unpaid for if there is just a run-of-the-mill 
recession. You'll have to decide if this risk is worth the few extra dollars 
you'll earn on your money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been trying to find out the value of two gold coins that I obtained 
from an estate, but have been unsuccessful. One is a 1901 $10 gold piece with 
an eagle, 13 stars and three arrows on the lower right. It is in perfect 
condition. The other is dated 1846 and is a $5 gold piece. It has three arrows 
in the lower right, 13 stars and an eagle. -- Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
A: The key phrase is "perfect condition." If the $10 piece is one of the few 
truly perfect ones -- in the numismatic sense of the word -- it could be worth 
"thousands of dollars," according to Norman Stack, partner of Stack's, a New 
York rare coin dealer. If it is less than perfect, it's worth between $250 and 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 piece is more common and worth around $150, he says. 
</P>
<P>
You should also check the coin for the city in which it was minted. The letters 
O for New Orleans, C for Charlotte, N.C., or D for Dahlonega, Ga., might 
appear. If there is no letter, it was minted in Philadelphia. The D, O and C 
markings would add to the coin's value. JOHN CRUDELE

MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: OBSTACLES DOG STOCKS AS TRADING SEASON BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Albert E. Sindlinger conducted his survey of American households early 
this month, only 3.1% of the people who already owned stock said they planned 
to buy more in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
That figure, while extremely low, was a slight improvement over just one month 
earlier. Sindlinger, who has been conducting his survey daily for 36 years, 
says only 2.2% of the stockholders in early August said they would buy more 
shares. That was an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is as disillusioned about the stock market now as they were in 
1930," says Sindlinger. 
</P>
<P>
The public's attitude is just one of the many hurdles the stock market faces as 
it enters the fall -- which, to Wall Street's mind, is the equivalent of 
beginning a new year. As traders came back from Labor Day and summer vacation 
last week, they faced a major psychological barrier: In two of the past three 
years, the stock market has celebrated the arrival of fall by -- what else? -- 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
And factors like the economy and the outlook for inflation are much bleaker 
this year than during the depressing falls of 1987 or 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Those facts haven't gone unnoticed by foreigners, who seem to have pulled away 
from U.S. financial markets. They've been lured away, the experts say, by 
higher interest rates and greater security overseas, and pushed away by the 
rapid deterioration in the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Even professional investors and money managers, while publicly extolling the 
stock market's virtues, appear to be turning as cautious as small investors 
after this summer's volatility in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street pros are punch-drunk," says William LeFevre, chief market 
strategist for Advest Corp. "They were euphoric in July but became depressed 
after the Middle East situation resulted in higher oil prices and a further 
erosion of the domestic economy." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts would argue that the economy was failing even before Iraq invaded 
Kuwait and put the world over an oil barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Argus Research Corp. had already been predicting that the nation's gross 
national product would contract in the final quarter of 1990. Now it believes 
that the economy will shrink by a bigger amount -- 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Argus also is predicting that the economic contraction will be accompanied by 
uncomfortably high inflation and (for a time) rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Federal Reserve Board reduces interest rates, experts fear that 
there is no way to force reluctant banks to give the economy a nudge by 
granting loans. 
</P>
<P>
As one investment banker said last week, the only way to get banks back into 
the business of lending would be to grant the entire industry a moratorium on 
government supervision of their loan quality. 
</P>
<P>
Since that isn't going to happen, experts say, a reduction in short-term 
interest rates by the Fed (which is now widely expected) might have little 
effect on business. Even worse, once the Fed reduces interest rates -- its most 
effective weapon -- Wall Street won't have anything good to anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, if the rate cut doesn't help the economy, financial markets 
could become more depressed than they are now. 
</P>
<P>
John Williams, a private economist, says it typically takes six months for 
lower interest rates to start pumping life into the economy. A full percentage 
point reduction in interest rates will generate an improvement of only 4% in 
corporate profits, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
Since many experts believe that company earnings are going to be significantly 
lower in the third and fourth quarters, a 4% improvement might go virtually 
unnoticed by the stock market. The Fed could have fired its silver bullet for 
no reason. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Wall Street would have expected a respite between 
now and mid-October, when corporate profits begin to be released. But the 
unstable situation in the Middle East may have robbed financial markets of that 
breathing space. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who might have bought stocks now with the idea of unloading them 
before the arrival of third-quarter profit reports have to worry every minute 
these days about bad news from the Middle East. Some professional traders are 
unloading all their stock just before President Bush or Iraq's Saddam Hussein 
appears on television. They have the attitude that you never know when someone 
is going to say the wrong thing. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts do see a candle at the end of the economic tunnel, however. 
</P>
<P>
H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., says 
private demand for credit is "falling like a rock" as the economy slows. He 
thinks this will offset the federal government's insatiable appetite for 
borrowing, preventing interest rates from rising. 
</P>
<P>
While Heinemann thinks there could be additional pressure on corporate profits 
short term, eventually he believes that declining interest rates will boost 
profits and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, it's Happy New Year -- and keep your head down.

Time Warner May Sell Part of Cable-TV Unit 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Time Inc. merger with Warner Communications was panned by 
investors and the new Time Warner stock was driven off a cliff, Wall Street has 
been wondering what the entertainment firm would do to cure itself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to Wall Street sources, Time Warner Inc. may be thinking of 
revitalizing its shares by selling a piece of one of its biggest assets, its 
cable television business. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Time Warner has already approached some would-be buyers, with 
little success. Speculation is that Time will combine its 82%-owned American TV 
&amp; Communications cable operation with Warner Cable. It would then sell off 
a piece of the combined entity to a third party, or (less likely) to the 
public. Or it could settle for a joint venture with another cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street source said such a move could be "a start." But he wouldn't 
confirm that talks had actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Time Warner officials met recently with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. -- and 
it also left the impression there that a restructuring of the cable operation 
was in the works. "Management indicated that it is aware of investor concerns 
about high leverage, a situation that the Time and Warner managements would 
both like to alleviate," Oppenheimer analyst Dennis McAlpine said of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
McAlpine said, however, that Time Warner management added that it would like to 
see passage of an acceptable cable TV re-regulation bill so it can "compare its 
options." 
</P>
<P>
The Oppenheimer analyst says he took this to mean that the company was 
considering a restructuring of its cable operations -- but would wait for the 
regulatory air to clear first. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent rumors, McAlpine said Time Warner indicated that it would not 
sell a piece of its American magazine operations, or attempt to find a partner 
for its record operations. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner has nearly $11 billion in debt as a result of the combination of 
the two companies. If completely sold, the cable TV operations could be worth 
$10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unions May Be Scaring Would-Be UAL Bidders 
</P>
<P>
Why isn't anyone else interested in owning United Airlines? 
</P>
<P>
UAL is a very profitable company; it flies to some of the most exotic foreign 
cities. Yet in all the months that the airline's unions have been trying to put 
together a buyout of its parent, UAL Inc., no other bidders have stepped 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a very simple explanation. Wall Street sources close to the UAL 
situation say the unions have privately threatened to strike anybody who tries 
to buy the company. The unions apparently want no offers that compete with 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The threat, says the source, may have caused other potential bidders to back 
off. After all, he said, what acquirer in his right mind would buy a company 
that immediately would be struck? And what bank would lend money to someone 
who's buying a firm that would likely be the target of a strike? 
</P>
<P>
So, mysteriously -- or so it seemed until now -- nobody else made a bid for UAL 
over these many months. It seems even more mysterious, given the fact that 
UAL's recent price is enormously below its peak. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, UAL's unions were given two additional months to come up with 
the $4 billion in financing they need to buy the airline. The unions and their 
advisers are now said to be trying to restructure their $200-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest shareholder, is also said to be ready to wage 
a proxy solicitation if the unions' bid fails and UAL's board fails to come up 
with a way to boost the price of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is: What if the unions don't like what the board comes up 
with? Is there a strike in UAL's future? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Bad-News Bears in Baseball Card Outlook 
</P>
<P>
Smith Barney &amp; Co. thinks demographics are just right for a boom in the 
baseball card business. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Morrow, an analyst at Smith Barney, told clients that there will be 17.3 
million boys between 6 and 14 by the year 2000. That's a 7.2% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"With the numbers of 6- to 14-year-olds now projected to accelerate, the 
outlook for sports card sales is even getting better," Morrow says. 
</P>
<P>
Boys between these ages are the biggest customers of the three major baseball 
card makers -- Topps Co., Fleer Corp. and Leaf Inc.'s Donruss division. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, there were 18.86 million boys between 6 and 14. But that group 
dwindled to 16.2 million in 1980 and rebounded only to 16.4 million in 1990. 
Even so, baseball card sales did well in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow estimates that $345 million worth of baseball cards were sold last year, 
up 35% from 1988. And he predicts that the business will expand a healthy 15% a 
year the next several years.

ANYONE WHO SHOPS knows all about the phenomenal success of Laura Ashley's 
classic English designs. 
</P>
<P>
First there were the fashions, then the bolts of matching printed fabrics, wall 
coverings, linens and small home-furnishing items. The company was the first to 
introduce coordinated home furnishings at the consumer level. The 
home-furnishings line grew so popular it demanded its own showcase; thus, the 
Laura Ashley Home Store was born. 
</P>
<P>
The first branch in Southern California, a 2,640-square-foot South Coast Plaza 
store, features the entire range of Laura Ashley furnishings, presented, for 
inspiration, in room vignettes.

JEWELRY FOR THE SPACE AGE

<P>
IRIDESCENT, METALLIC bits glitter against black backgrounds, resulting in the 
illusion of sparkling objects floating in dark waters. In Julie Bauer's 
wearable art glass for men and women, the fusion of layers of glass creates a 
third dimension. 
</P>
<P>
New in her repertoire -- which includes earrings, pins, necklaces, bracelets, 
tie bars, bolo ties and color pins -- are works using dichroic glass, which she 
describes as "a modern, Space Age material in neon colors: fluorescent green, 
turquoise blue and gold." 
</P>
<P>
It is apparent from her work that the San Diego-based artist likes to play with 
triangular designs. Elements in her jewelry always appear in sets of threes, 
borrowing the concept from Japanese gardens. "I want peace in my work, not 
chaos," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to designing jewelry (prices range from about $25 for a pair of 
earrings to $200 for elaborate necklaces with 14-karat-gold stars imbedded in 
glass), Bauer also makes free-form bowls and wall sculptures -- all in her 
trademark media: iridescent, fused glass. (Bowls are tagged at $35 up to $500; 
wall sculptures, from $125 to $1,800.) 
</P>
<P>
Though Bauer has pieces for men and women, she says she has made a special 
effort to produce jewelry for men, because designers "are not spotlighting men 
as much as women. Men are not ornamented enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Bauer can be reached at Glass Act, 544 3rd St., Imperial Beach; (619) 
423-4150.

ORANGE COAST SHUTS OUT LONG BEACH IN OPENER

<P>
As opening games go, Orange Coast College had to be pretty pleased with its 
30-0 victory over Long Beach Saturday at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates were impressive in all aspects, despite preseason reports that Long 
Beach had one of the best defenses in Southern California. OCC used three 
quarterbacks, 10 running backs and eight receivers. And no one got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased," OCC Coach Bill Workman said. "We knew their defense was going 
to be very, very tough and they proved it. We just wore them out. They were out 
there so long." 
</P>
<P>
OCC's defense was as impressive as expected and because of it, Long Beach's 
offense was almost nonexistent for the first half. The Vikings had only 18 
yards in the first quarter and 54 by halftime. Long Beach finished with 148 
yards passing, 52 in the fourth quarter, and 24 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 possessions, Long Beach reached OCC territory only three times. The 
Vikings punted seven times, were intercepted twice, turned it over on downs two 
times and fumbled once. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Roberts and defensive back Scott Seymour each had an 
interception and defensive lineman Vince Legaspi recovered a fumble for OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Greg Angelovic and tailback Adrian Steen led OCC to 343 yards in 
total offense. Angelovic was nine of 16 for 106 yards and a touchdown and had 
an interception. His scoring pass, a 19-yarder to Jeff Smith, gave OCC a 20-0 
lead with 12:55 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Steen ran for 72 yards in 15 carries. Brian Theriot, a 32-year-old former 
middle-distance runner from UCLA, had 40 yards in six carries. Last season, he 
ran for 15 yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wade of OCC kicked field goals of 45, 25, and 27 yards and three extra 
points for OCC. He lined up to try a 39-yarder in the second quarter, but 
holder Mark Recktenwald picked up the ball and threw a 22-yard scoring pass to 
Derek Whiddon with 9:23 left in the half. Whiddon reached over two Long Beach 
defenders to get the ball and give OCC a 10-0 lead.

Esperanza High School managed to defeat Santa Ana, 20-7, Saturday night at 
Bradford Stadium without throwing many passes and without top running back Mark 
Parlin, who is injured. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Esperanza, which was supposed to take the wraps off third-year 
quarterback Keith McDonald in 1990, reverted to its old standby, the running 
game, to gain the nonleague victory before 2,500 fans. The Aztecs gained 228 
yards rushing and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald completed two of six passes for 61 yards and a touchdown, but the 
senior wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept everything simple tonight," McDonald said. "We just ran our basic 
offense. We don't want to show everything we've got in the first game." 
</P>
<P>
That approach was guaranteed two weeks ago when Parlin bruised his thigh in the 
team's final scrimmage. A year ago, he sustained torn ligaments in his ankle in 
the scrimmage and missed the opening three games. 
</P>
<P>
Parlin's replacements, Marcus Tayui and Jarod Smith, were more than capable 
Saturday night. Smith led all rushers with 107 yards in 14 carries and scored 
on a 70-yard run off a double reverse in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tayui scored the first touchdown of the game, shifting through the right side 
of Santa Ana's defensive line and then outracing the secondary to the end zone 
for a 25-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza used another big play for its second touchdown of the first half. 
Smith sprinted down the left sideline and McDonald found him all alone on the 
10-yard line for a 30-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Plasencia Santa Ana's returning all-league kicker, used his feet to get his 
team its only touchdown of the first half. Plasencia ran 34 yards on a fake 
punt play to give Santa Ana a first down on Esperanza's 21-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Perez threw an 11-yard pass to Marc Contreras, the player he beat out 
for the quarterback position, to give the Saints another first down at 10-yard 
line. Fullback Kevin Pola scored two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana gained only 41 yards rushing and its top back, Alfonso Rivas, has 
been declared academically ineligible for the next five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Perez completed eight of 20 passes for 78 yards and had one interception.

Villa Park High School scored 30 points in the first half of a 43-21 victory 
over host Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans scored first when Stanton Nielson recovered a blocked punt in the 
end zone to make the score 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande came back with a 12-play, 80-yard drive capped by Marcus Wilson's 
one-yard run which tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Williams' 90-yard touchdown run on the Spartans' first offensive play of 
the game gave Villa Park (1-0) a 14-7 lead with 5:02 minutes remaining in the 
first quarter. The Spartans, ranked No. 7 in Orange County, controlled the rest 
of the game as five players scored touchdowns. They led 30-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a junior, paced the Villa Park offense by gaining 153 yards in 14 
carries. He also had an 88-yard kickoff return negated by a clipping penalty.

SLAYING ENDS BEACH DISPUTE IN DANA POINT

<TEXT>
<P>
An argument between two South County teen-agers on a sunny, crowded beach ended 
Saturday with one of them shot to death and the other in custody, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place about 1 p.m. in an area known as Dana Strand, at the 
southern tip of Salt Creek Beach Park, a county-run beach just north of the 
Dana Point Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheriff's Lt. William Francis, deputies responded to reports of a 
shooting on the beach, where they found bystanders giving first aid to an 
18-year-old Dana Point man with a chest wound. Paramedics took the victim to a 
nearby hospital, where he was reported dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
His identity was being withheld Saturday night until relatives could be 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Francis said shootings on Orange County beaches are "very 
uncommon." Police and lifeguard officials up and down the county coast said 
Saturday that not a single beach shooting had been reported this year. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting gave deputies a description of the suspect, a 
16-year-old from Laguna Niguel, and the vehicle he was driving. The youth, 
whose name is being withheld because he is a juvenile, was arrested without 
incident a short time later at Interstate 5 and Ortega Highway in San Juan 
Capistrano, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was being questioned Saturday night by sheriff's deputies in Santa 
Ana, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses agreed that the two had been involved in a running dispute that began 
before Saturday, involving a pickup truck window that had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, according to a witness who asked not to be identified, was walking 
down a bluff toward the area in the sand where the suspect and a group of 
friends were sitting. The suspect saw the victim walking toward him and pulled 
a small-caliber, short-barreled pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up, and he had this gun," said Andy Manning of Monrovia in Los 
Angeles County, who frequents the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect shouted, according to another witness, "Leave the beach or I'll 
kill you! I'll kill you if you come after me! I don't want to kill you, just 
leave!" 
</P>
<P>
The witness said the victim replied, "Just pay me for the window!" 
</P>
<P>
"They were both shaking," added a third witness, an 18-year-old man from Dana 
Point who also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The two continued their shouting match as they headed north along the strand, 
the victim pursuing the youth with the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said the victim said several times: "You're not going to shoot me! 
You're not going to get away this time! I'm going to get you!" 
</P>
<P>
The suspect turned and pulled the trigger -- hitting on an empty chamber, 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth ran again, then turned, went to his knees and fired again, Manning 
said. This time the pistol fired and hit the victim in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, witnesses said, the suspect ran north along the beach, to a 
beach path. Paul R. Jacobson of Glendale said he saw the young man calmly 
walking up the beach path, with the pistol in his hand, pointed at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said he saw police retrieve a pistol from the bushes near the top of 
the beach path. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials who patrol San Clemente, San Onofre, Doheny, Huntington 
Beach and Bolsa Chica beaches said no shootings have been reported at any of 
those beaches this year; police and lifeguards at Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, 
Huntington Beach and Seal Beach made a similar report. 
</P>
<P>
However, a man was shot to death last month in the parking lot of Huntington 
State Beach.

WILSON'S MARGIN IN O.C. FALLING SHORT OF VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: TIMES POLL PROJECTS HIS VOTE TOTAL WELL BELOW THAT CAPTURED TWICE IN 
THE COUNTY BY GOV. DEUKMEJIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In California's most Republican county, GOP Sen. Pete Wilson is well ahead of 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein in the race for governor, but a Times Orange County 
Poll found his lead still below the level that experts consider necessary to 
win statewide. 
</P>
<P>
With about eight weeks remaining until the Nov. 6 election, more than 1 in 4 of 
the county's voters were still undecided about their choice for governor. Even 
among Orange County Republicans -- some of the most loyal voters in the state 
-- nearly a quarter said they had not made a selection. 
</P>
<P>
Among all county voters, Wilson led Feinstein 48% to 22% and he ran ahead in 
every age, income, sex and geographic category. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Wilson holds a better than 2-to-1 edge over Feinstein, the high 
number of undecideds means that the size of the margin of victory is an 
uncertainty in this race," said Mark Baldassare, who conducted the poll for The 
Times. "Wilson's current vote margin is well below Deukmejian's in 1982 and 
1986." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for lieutenant governor, the poll also found Orange County's native 
daughter -- Marian Bergeson -- running ahead of incumbent Democrat Leo T. 
McCarthy but far short of the winning margin she should have in California's 
Republican mother lode. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, a state senator from Newport Beach, was ahead 35% to 26% and she was 
leading in all of the age, sex and geographic categories. McCarthy was slightly 
ahead, however, among voters earning annual incomes under $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's position was particularly weak considering that 4 of 10 voters from 
the home territory she has served since 1984 were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll of 486 Orange County registered voters was conducted Sept. 4 
through 6 by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. The margin of error for the 
entire sample is plus or minus 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is such a stronghold of the Republican Party that GOP strategists 
consider it a key benchmark of their performance in statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, they figure statewide candidates need a victory margin in Orange 
County of at least 200,000 votes in order to offset Democratic strongholds in 
San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said Wilson's 26-point lead in The Times Orange County Poll 
represents about 174,000 votes. In comparison, Wilson carried Orange County by 
323,000 votes when he won reelection to the U.S. Senate in 1988 over Democrat 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson is running in her first statewide general election, and Baldassare 
said her nine-point lead over McCarthy represents less than a 10,000-vote edge. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide poll conducted by The Times two weeks ago showed McCarthy leading 
Bergeson 35% to 17% with nearly half of the voters undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide in the governor's race, The Times Poll found that Wilson and 
Feinstein were running dead even, both with 39% of the vote. That poll also 
found that the strong support from women that Feinstein enjoyed in the primary 
had faded. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, The Times Orange County Poll found sex to be a slight advantage 
for Feinstein but no help for Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was supported by 28% of the county's women voters, six points ahead 
of her support among all voters. But Wilson had a strong lead among men. Even a 
surprising 31% of Democratic men favored Wilson. He was also backed by 73% of 
the Republican men. 
</P>
<P>
"The gender advantage (for Feinstein) fades among Republican women, where only 
13% intend to vote for Feinstein and 56% support Wilson," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, meanwhile, had almost identical support from men and women. 
</P>
<P>
One possible reason for the flat performance by Bergeson among women voters 
could be the issue of abortion. Bergeson is opposed to legalized abortion while 
McCarthy supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Both Feinstein and Wilson also support abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's support improved slightly among middle-income and South County 
voters. Wilson's lead, on the other hand, expanded significantly (57%-18%) 
among voters earning annual incomes over $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was also supported by 65% of the Republican voters but the poll found 
fewer than half of the Democratic voters (44%) backing Feinstein. Nearly 1 in 3 
Democrats was undecided in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
In the lieutenant governor's race, the poll also found that Bergeson may have 
been right when she claimed in her primary that Wilson would benefit from her 
placement on the GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"In what could be a factor in this expected close election, lieutenant governor 
candidate Bergeson could end up assisting Wilson win votes more than McCarthy 
helps Feinstein," Baldassare said. "Three in four Bergeson supporters would 
vote for Wilson for governor, while only 45% of McCarthy voters say they will 
back Feinstein."

How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County poll was conducted Sept. 4 through 6 by Mark Baldassare 
&amp; Associates. The telephone survey of 486 registered voters was conducted 
on weeknights using a random sample of listed and unlisted Orange County 
telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey included a question screening for registered voters. An equal number 
of men and women were interviewed. The sample was statistically weighted to 
reflect the actual population distribution of Orange County registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
For a sample of this size, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.5% for the 
total sample. For subgroups such as Democrats and Republicans, it would be 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
Sampling error is just one type of error that can affect opinion polls. Results 
also can be affected by question wording, survey timing and other variables.

SAND SCULPTORS LEND A HAND TO CHARITABLE CAUSES

As the team of amateur sculptors from Southern California Gas Co. tackled a 
small mountain of hardened sand Saturday morning, Perry Hallman spelled out 
their goal for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, hopefully, we will beat Disneyland," said Hallman, who was 
overseeing creation of the gas company's sand sculpture, a boy beckoning to two 
playful dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The entry, titled "Friends Helping Friends," was one of 51 entries in the 
seventh annual Sandcastle Contest, sponsored by the United Way of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The contest that pitted corporate and nonprofit companies in friendly 
competition marked the beginning of the United Way's yearlong campaign to raise 
$22.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The money, said United Way spokesman Jeff Rocke, will go to fund a variety of 
charitable programs, from the Red Cross to an array of programs dealing with 
health care, child care, homelessness and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying hard to emphasize that although this is a day of fun and sun," 
Rocke said, "the real purpose of the United Way contest is to help people know 
that we are there to help." 
</P>
<P>
For four hours, while beach-goers and family cheerleaders looked on, teams of 
amateur sand sculptors hunkered down to turn blocks of sand into towering 
castles, detailed sculptures and free-form objects. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, neither the gas company nor Disneyland took home the 
trophy for best sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Disneyland's dazzling sculpture of characters from the motion picture 
"The Little Mermaid," the top honor went to the the nonprofit organization Sand 
Sculpture Coalition for its rendering of "Hobbit" creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It was darling," said United Way spokeswoman Dena Montiel. 
</P>
<P>
Honors for the best sandcastle went to Chevron USA, whose fortress was 
surrounded by a mermaid-eating dragon. 
</P>
<P>
A special award went to Pacific Mutual for its sculpture of a homeless man and 
his dog lying in the street. The free-form first-place award went to Kevin 
Chung and Friends for their creation called "Waves." 
</P>
<P>
The best first-time entry went to Texaco for its carving of seals on the beach. 
The award for the most team spirit went to Lucky Market for a sculpture called 
"At the Hop." 
</P>
<P>
And the most humorous award went to Unocal for a sculpture called "Conserve 
Water, Bathe with a Friend," in which a boy taking a bath is horrified to 
discover an alligator swimming in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we did an offshore oil rig," said Unocal employee Marie Nixon. "That 
didn't go over at all."

3 INJURED IN COLLISION NEAR IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: A TEEN-AGER LOSES CONTROL OF HIS CAR ON JEFFREY ROAD AND HITS A SEDAN 
CARRYING A WOMAN AND HER SON, CHP SAYS.

<P>
Three people were injured, one critically, when a 17-year-old youth lost 
control of his car Saturday on Jeffrey Road near Irvine and crashed into an 
oncoming sedan carrying a woman and her son, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed Jeffrey Road for 90 minutes between Irvine Boulevard and 
Trabuco Road as emergency crews removed the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Young, 46, of Irvine suffered severe head injuries and both of her legs 
were broken, according to Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young, who helped 
supervise the removal of victims from the wreckage. She was listed in critical 
condition late Saturday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Her son, 12, whose name was withheld because of his age, sustained a broken arm 
but no other apparent injuries, Young said. The boy also was treated at UCI 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old, whose name was not released, suffered facial cuts and a broken 
hip and legs and was flown to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Based on observations by Dan Young and comments from a spokeswoman for the 
California Highway Patrol, this is what happened: 
</P>
<P>
At 12:48 p.m., the 17-year-old was traveling on Jeffrey Road, just north of 
Irvine Boulevard, a semi-rural stretch bordered by an orange grove. He drifted 
to his right, losing control of his 1983 Mazda. In an attempt to regain 
control, he over-corrected to the left, colliding head-on with the car carrying 
the mother and her son, who were traveling in a 1985 Volvo sedan. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Young said Eleanor Young was removed after 10 minutes and taken to 
the hospital. Crews had to slice off the top of the Mazda and use the hydraulic 
"jaws of life" to free the 17-year-old, Young said.

YOUTH SHOT IN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT MOTEL

<P>
A 16-year-old boy was shot early Saturday by an innkeeper during a failed 
robbery attempt at an Anaheim motel. The teen-ager and an alleged accomplice 
were arrested a short time later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded youth was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Alvaro Taboada Jurive, a 21-year-old unemployed laborer from 
Anaheim, on suspicion of commercial robbery. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. Greg Mattis, police were summoned to the Admirals Cove Motel 
in the 100 block of West Ball Road at 2:17 a.m. Someone reported shots being 
fired into the motel, Mattis said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Officers who arrived at the motel were told -- apparently through interviews 
with the innkeeper or witnesses -- that motel manager Jim Chung, 48, of Anaheim 
had exchanged gunfire with two robbers, who fled west on Ball Road after 
failing to steal any money. 
</P>
<P>
Mattis was patrolling that area and stopped a car in which the youth and Jurive 
were traveling on Cerritos Avenue. Chung subsequently identified the pair as 
his assailants, according to police. A sawed-off rifle allegedly used by the 
suspects was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Chung could not be reached for comment. Officer John Oldroyd said he did not 
know the youth's name or what type of weapon with which he was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at UCI Medical Center in Orange, where the teen-ager apparently was 
taken for treatment, declined to comment on his condition.

A 34-year-old Los Angeles man was killed and a 26-year-old Anaheim man was 
wounded in a drive-by shooting Saturday evening at Mile Square Park in Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department, which would not release the identity of 
either man, is seeking five men in connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Francis said the victims and suspects are Vietnamese and apparently 
knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good eyeball witnesses" to the shooting, Francis said. He said the 
department could not say whether the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place about 6:30 p.m. near Euclid Avenue and Heil Street. The 
Los Angeles man was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center, where he died. The Anaheim man was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where he was reported in stable condition.

FIRST O.C. CABLE NEWS CHANNEL TO DEBUT SEPT. 17; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: START-UP OF TV OPERATION WILL OPEN ANOTHER FRONT IN THE ONGOING WAR 
BETWEEN FREEDOM NEWSPAPERS INC. AND TIMES MIRROR CO.

<P>
Over the past several months, a cramped suite of rooms in the Orange County 
Register building here has been transformed into a gleaming warren of 
sophisticated computer and video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Walls are lined with new television monitors, videotape editing machines, 
computer graphics generators and picture storage units. Specially equipped 
Macintosh computers sit atop every desk. Robotic television cameras survey the 
studio set. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, this expensive ensemble will go live on Sept. 
17, beaming an ambitious experiment in local television news to 190,000 Orange 
County cable subscribers. The service, dubbed Orange County Newschannel, will 
be the second in the nation to offer 24-hour local news on cable television, 
and Freedom Newspapers Inc. is betting an estimated $10 million that it will be 
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
OCN represents more than just a new cable service. It also marks the opening of 
another front in the ongoing news war between Freedom, which owns the Register 
and a chain of Orange County community newspapers, and Times Mirror Co., which 
owns The Los Angeles Times and Dimension Cable Services. 
</P>
<P>
Media analysts and others familiar with the project praise Freedom's 
initiative, but caution that OCN has a number of marketing, journalistic, and 
organizational hurdles to clear. Freedom must create an interesting program, 
persuade local cable operators to carry the service, persuade large numbers of 
advertisers to buy commercial time and build an effective partnership between 
the Register and OCN. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it has some attractive potential benefits (for Freedom), and if it 
takes off it will have major benefits," said Tom Adams, a newspaper analyst 
with Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm in Carmel. "But it's going to 
be tough to make much money." 
</P>
<P>
OCN's strategy hinges on the idea that Orange County, which lacks a major 
over-the-air television channel of its own, is given short shrift by local news 
broadcasts originating in Los Angeles. Alan J. Bell, president of Freedom's 
broadcasting division, says the absence of local television has created a 
tremendous amount of "anger and frustration" among both viewers and 
advertisers, thus priming the market for OCN. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a niche that's crying to be filled," agreed Jim Bequette, western 
region vice president at Comcast Cablevision in Seal Beach, one of the local 
cable systems that has already agreed to carry OCN. "There is very little 
Orange County-centered news on television." 
</P>
<P>
This theory is already being tested by News 12 Long Island, the only other 
24-hour local news service in the country. Like Orange County, Long Island is 
an affluent, heavily populated suburb that has an identity separate from a 
large, nearby city, yet remains largely dependent on city-based media. 
</P>
<P>
OCN's most important early challenge may be persuading reluctant cable 
operators -- including Dimension Cable, which has over 110,000 subscribers in 
affluent south Orange County -- to put the program on their systems. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Paragon Cable, Comcast Cablevision, Rossmoor Electric, Community 
Services Cable, and Rancho Santa Margarita Cable have agreed to air OCN, 
according to Kenneth D. Tiven, the veteran television news executive hired to 
run the channel. 
</P>
<P>
With two large operators and three small ones signed up, OCN will have access 
to about 190,000 of an estimated 460,000 cable households in Orange County. 
Tiven said contracts are pending with several other companies that would bring 
the total to 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bell is confident that "if we have a good product, we will be on every system, 
because the public will demand it." He offers an attractive package: OCN will 
be provided to cable companies free of charge for the first 10 years, and the 
local operators will also receive two minutes per hour of advertising time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, OCN may have a tough time signing up all the cable firms. Times 
Mirror-owned Dimension Cable poses a special problem because of the heated 
competition between The Times and Register. Leo Brennan, vice-president and 
general manager of Dimension, said no decision on OCN will be made until after 
the service is launched. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times officials are sensitive about the news channel, which will 
compete with The Times for advertising dollars and serve as a promotional 
vehicle for a competing newspaper. The Times in May refused to run a full-page 
advertisement for OCN, a decision that was sharply criticized by Freedom and 
several newspaper analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is also pursuing a limited cable television news project of its own 
through a joint venture with KCAL-TV. The Los Angeles television station 
produces 4 1/2-minute Orange County news spots based on stories provided by The 
Times Orange County Edition, and those briefs are inserted into Cable News 
Network's Headline News Service twice every hour. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Higby, president of the Times Orange County Edition, said the KCAL 
venture was "the only response we envision at this time" to the OCN launch. 
Higby, who previously served as an executive with Times Mirror Cable 
Television, added, "Contrary to what Orange County Newschannel says, more local 
news is not one of the things that comes up in terms of cable viewers' 
desires." 
</P>
<P>
OCN may also be concerned about a different cable project: a full-time Orange 
County news service being considered by Copley/Colony Cable, a joint venture of 
La Jolla-based Copley Newspapers and Providence, R.I.-based Colony 
Communications. Copley Colony owns or operates cable systems serving over 
70,000 Orange County households. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Clark, president of Colony Communications, said the company is still 
pursuing the project, but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cable operators say they have other reasons to be wary of OCN. "We see a local 
news channel as eating into our ad sales," said Steve Everett, general manager 
of Cablevision of Orange. "They're going to be knocking on the same doors." 
</P>
<P>
Many cable companies view local advertising sales as their key source of 
revenue growth in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said OCN will receive a boost from the current political climate in the 
cable business. The cable industry is under fire for rising rates and poor 
service, and providing more local programming is one means of deflecting such 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
OCN has launched a print and radio advertising campaign urging cable 
subscribers to contact their cable companies and request the news channel. OCN 
has also contacted public officials in many communities, providing them with 
information and a video touting the public benefits of true Orange County TV 
news. 
</P>
<P>
OCN clearly hopes that Dimension, Copley/Colony and other systems that don't 
sign up will find themselves under public pressure to do so. Dimension faces 
added pressure because Times Mirror owns a newspaper that serves the same area, 
and any suggestion that it was hindering the development of other news 
operations could have political and regulatory consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Higby called OCN's lobbying of cable subscribers and local politicians a 
"questionable tactic," and characterized the news channel as an attempt by 
Freedom "to protect its (the Register's) local advertising base at the expense 
of cable operators and small local newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
But Bell countered that OCN would help local cable companies in the same way 
that broadcast television networks help local affiliate stations. "A rising 
tide lifts all boats," he said. "A network can afford a level of production 
that an affiliate cannot afford, and the value of the (advertising) time is 
enhanced. They need each other." 
</P>
<P>
The OCN programming will feature more in-depth stories than a typical TV news 
program, Tiven said, though major stories will be repeated frequently in the 
fashion of all-news radio stations. He added that OCN is developing a novel 
format that will attempt to "bring the viewer inside the news-gathering 
process." 
</P>
<P>
OCN hopes to break new ground by using live computer graphics on the air. 
Traffic reports, for example, will feature computerized road maps that 
automatically display alternate routes when the traffic reporter enters 
information on an accident. 
</P>
<P>
OCN will have some national and international news, but Bell says such coverage 
will be sparing and will always be done with an eye toward the Orange County 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Some are skeptical of OCN's ability to keep the program interesting. "There 
just aren't that many stories out there," said Calvin Brack, general manager of 
KDOC-TV in Anaheim, a UHF broadcast station that produces a half-hour evening 
news show for Orange County. "I think they'll have real problems." 
</P>
<P>
But others say OCN should prove very popular. "The people are there, the market 
is there, the news is there," said Warren Cereghino, news director at KTLA in 
Los Angeles. "What they're doing is very smart." 
</P>
<P>
High-tech equipment -- combined with the absence of unions -- will allow OCN to 
operate with fewer technical personnel than comparable operations. OCN has a 
staff of around 70 people -- Tiven would not give a precise figure -- compared 
with 130 at News 12 Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said these efficiencies would keep operating costs below those of News 12, 
which spends more than $10 million annually. People familiar with OCN estimate 
capital costs at $5 million to $7 million, with several million more for other 
start-up-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
OCN will also gain some efficiencies from having the news gathering resources 
of the Register at its disposal. Tiven downplays the importance of the Register 
and says newspaper reporters will be used mainly as expert commentators in the 
fashion of ABC's "Nightline." "We don't need as much help as people think we 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But current and former Register reporters say there have been concerns that OCN 
would add to the workload and tip competing newspapers to exclusive stories. 
Register editor N. Christian Anderson said, however, that any "anxiety" about 
OCN among the staff was simply a natural reaction to change. 
</P>
<P>
OCN will have to tread carefully in the advertising area as well. The 
television station has its own sales staff, but analysts believe some 
advertisers may divert money from the Register to OCN. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising budgets won't expand just because a new medium exists," noted Bob 
Woodworth, senior vice president in charge of media services in the Irvine 
office of AC&amp;R Advertising Inc. "To some extent it will cannibalize" 
Register ad sales, he predicted. 
</P>

But Bell insists that advertisers will try television without cutting print 
budgets, and that the real target is the $25 million spent on local radio and 
direct mail. "We'd like to sell to people who weren't able to use television 
before," he said. No package deals combining the Register and OCN are currently 
being offered. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, 30-second spots on OCN will sell for $100 or less, and OCN will even 
produce the advertisements in its own facilities at no charge. Bell conceded 
that these were start-up rates that will have to rise for OCN to turn a profit. 
He declined to predict when OCN would break even, but acknowledged it might 
take some time.

Cable industry officials say local news channels have been explored in many 
suburban markets around the country, but few have been launched because of the 
financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
News 12 Long Island, serving 600,000 households, hopes to stop losing money 
next year, about five years after it was launched, said news director Norman 
Fein. 
</P>
<P>
But News 12 charges cable operators a fee, and also has an advantage in that 
one of its owners, Cablevision, is also the dominant local cable company. 
</P>
<P>
But even if OCN takes many years to turn a profit, Freedom will have gained a 
strategic foothold in television. 
</P>
<P>
"Newspapers can't tell how important (local cable news) might be, but it's 
potentially a significant competitor," said John Morton, a Washington newspaper 
analyst. "They should at least dabble, and OCN is at the ambitious end of what 
newspapers have done."

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug and Dana Ridenour appeared to have everything they wanted, all within the 
hermetic walls of their 20-year marriage. They appeared prosperous, confident 
and happy. 
</P>
<P>
When they died July 29 in what seemed to be a double suicide, they appeared to 
have made their ultimate decision with mutual certainty. Before their deaths, 
the Ridenours filmed a videotape to document their shared enthusiasm over 
beating the Grim Reaper at his own game. 
</P>
<P>
But underneath the smiling faces and impeccable attire -- worn even while 
performing their bizarre suicide note -- two troubled people concealed their 
vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Despite tales of $50,000 in spare change that would fund a last fling, 
financial strife hounded the Anaheim couple: in 1985, they filed for 
bankruptcy; although they boasted of striking gold with their recent career 
change, their income stayed about the same; they admitted on the videotape that 
they owed $7,000 in back income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And in their videotape, Dana discussed a suicide that would happen "years and 
decades" later, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was only 3 1/2 months after they made the tape that Dana's husband 
put a shotgun to her head and pulled the trigger -- apparently as she dozed on 
a couch. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, Dana's body was curled on the cushions, her gracefully 
crossed feet propped on the arm of the couch. A manicured hand dangled toward 
the floor. The television set still buzzed. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet that (Doug) didn't know his wife would look like this," Barry 
remarked as he scanned photographs of the scene. "Often suicide victims get all 
prettied up before they kill themselves; they don't realize the trauma caused 
by a gun fired point-blank." 
</P>
<P>
Getting "all prettied up" would seem in character for a woman who never stepped 
outside the house in anything less formal than a business suit. Yet on her 
final night, Barry observed, Dana wore a plain cotton gown -- white, 
sleeveless, knee-length, nondescript. 
</P>
<P>
Barry believes that Doug shot the two pet poodles after killing his wife -- 
then sat down on the twin couch adjacent to Dana's deathbed, stuck the shotgun 
barrel into his mouth and fired the last round through his own head. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Doug sitting straight up, the gun resting in his left hand. He was 
dressed in his signature outfit -- crisply pressed jeans and a white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The audiovisual suicide note awaited Ronald Ridenour at his Santa Barbara home 
when he arrived from a birthday party the night of July 31. It had been mailed 
hours before the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Doug's kid brother rushed to Anaheim with hopes of persuading the couple to 
rethink their scheme, only to discover a horrifying fait accompli. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators who viewed the video reported that Douglas and Dana 
Ridenour "cheerfully" and "calmly" expressed their desire to die before they 
grew old. But, Sgt. Barry now admits, that portrayal oversimplified matters. 
</P>
<P>
What struck Barry most about the videotape, he said, was that Douglas and Dana 
seemed to be communicating on different planes. 
</P>
<P>
While Doug considered himself "old" at age 48, his wife reacted with insult 
when he implied the same of her. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see Dana get old," he said on the video. Dana, 45, spunkily 
retorted, "I beg your pardon!" 
</P>
<P>
Although they were on a leave of absence from work when they made the 
videotape, both were dressed for a day at the office -- Doug in coat and tie. 
Their poodles licking their faces, they sat on the couch where Dana would die 3 
1/2 months later. 
</P>
<P>
Doug did most of the the talking, while his wife smiled and nodded 
supportively. He opened with a sentimental tribute to his 22-year romance with 
Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Then he got to the crux of the message. "He said that he and his wife had 
always wanted to be in control of everything they did, and part of being in 
control is determining the point of your death," Barry said. "They were in 
agreement that it was the right thing for both of them, and they didn't want 
people to think that it had been more one person's idea" than the other's. 
</P>
<P>
About midway through the 20-minute presentation, Barry said, the couple's 
bright demeanor crumbled as Doug proclaimed: "This is about as old as I ever 
wanted to get." Dana suddenly seemed to sense his immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she continued smiling, although periodically she would turn her head 
from the camera and wipe away tears. Her voice developed a tremble. 
</P>
<P>
Doug listed the "toys" that Ronald stood to inherit -- VCRs, televisions and 
what not. "Enjoy," Dana piped in. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what's sort of pathetic?" Barry observed. "I walked through that 
house. It was a nice house . . . but they didn't have that much. They acted 
like they were leaving the brother all these treasures. Who needs another VCR?" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the degree that Dana Ridenour participated in her death, Barry plans 
to close the case after he receives the toxicology test results. 
</P>
<P>
"It will always be classified as a murder, but there is no point in us 
investigating it further," he said. "We're virtually certain of who pulled the 
trigger, and the defendant is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Once investigators no longer deemed the videotape evidentiary material, police 
returned it to Doug's brother. "He drove right down here to get it the day I 
called," Barry said. "He was adamant that nobody (outside the investigation) 
see the tape." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that Iraq's invasion of of Kuwait first jolted the headlines, 
Doug and Dana Ridenour shared the front page with Saddam Hussein in newspapers 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Before their deaths, hardly anyone really knew them, except Doug's brother and 
father. Dana had no close relatives, and neither had close friends. Neighbors 
and co-workers remember them as pleasant but standoffish. 
</P>
<P>
Then why the fascination with these unlikely celebrities? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe because such an absolute surrender to our universal fear of aging -- the 
sole rationale Doug and Dana offered -- makes people uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes more courage to live than to die, and that courage comes from 
pressing on to be with the ones you love," said Judy Dillavou, who with her 
husband, Dean Dillavou, owns Lincoln Realty in Orange, where the Ridenours last 
worked. "What I don't understand is, Doug and Dana liked being together so much 
-- why wouldn't they want to keep going on?" 
</P>
<P>
During their half-year stint at Lincoln Realty, the Ridenours sold three 
Anaheim Hills homes for about $350,000 each, Dillavou said. They had met so 
much success that they decided to relax for a few weeks, they told their 
employers last April. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not an unusual thing to do in the real estate business, since the sales 
people are independent contractors," Dean Dillavou explained. "Doug called and 
said they had come into some money and wanted to take a little time off. We 
were under the impression they had inherited money." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the Ridenours gave everyone the impression that they had a lot of 
money -- even colleagues who knew their salaries. At the graphics firm where he 
had worked for 14 years before trying new ventures, Doug boasted about Dana's 
high-paying secretarial position. 
</P>
<P>
"His wife had a fantastic job," former co-worker Al DeSpain recalled Doug 
saying. "He said it allowed him to do what he pleased (occupationally). He 
didn't have a problem with the fact that his wife made more money than he did." 
</P>
<P>
Doug never let on that he and Dana filed for bankruptcy five years ago. They 
were $33,650 in the red -- a debt accumulated mostly through credit card 
charges. Their property value totaled only $2,850, they claimed; the couple did 
not buy a home until 1988. Bankruptcy records show that Dana earned $31,200 in 
1984 at the Orange County branch of Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. accounting firm, 
where she had worked for 16 years. Doug brought in $15,600 as an illustrator at 
Fullerton-based Industrial Publications and Graphics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Doug quit the job he had held since 1975 and tried to start his own 
business, peddling large-scale earthquake-preparedness kits to schools and 
hospitals. When that failed, he persuaded Dana to go into real estate sales 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
A few months before he killed himself, Doug dropped by his former employer and 
raved about his lucrative new career. "He told us that he had made more money 
in one month than he could make in one year working here," said DeSpain, 
manager of Industrial Publications and Graphics. "He was thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
In their six months at her real estate company, Judy Dillavou estimated, the 
Ridenours garnered about $25,000 -- a respectable paycheck, certainly, but not 
much more than their joint income back when they filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet over the previous five years, Doug and Dana indicated on their videotape, 
they had managed to stash away $50,000 -- which they would withdraw for a 
splurge when their suicide became imminent. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the time of their deaths they had shown no signs of a spending 
spree. Neighbors said the Ridenours stayed close to home during their 
sabbatical from work. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the videotape, police said, Doug volunteered that he and Dana owed 
$7,000 in taxes that they might not pay before dying. Their video was filmed 
April 19, four days after the Internal Revenue Service's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Right up to the bitter end, it seems, the proud couple painted a rosier picture 
of their finances than reality bore out. 
</P>
<P>
Said suicide expert Mark S. Goulston, assistant clinical professor of 
psychiatry at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute: "In all my experience, I've 
never known a happy person to commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Ridenour seemed almost as if she landed in Southern California 22 years 
ago without a past. 
</P>
<P>
Her childhood remains hazy even to her in-laws, who could only say for sure 
that she was raised in the Dallas area by relatives other than her parents. "I 
didn't learn too much about her life," said Doug's father, Floyd Ridenour. 
</P>
<P>
What can be gleaned from public records is that Dana Sue was born Feb. 15, 
1945, in Electra, Tex., to Glenn and Opal Houser. At the time of her birth, her 
father was stationed in Europe in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Apparently he never 
saw his daughter; he died in action on March 20, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
On the videotape, according to police, Dana said she had no heirs. "Doug 
brought up her mother, but she quickly cut him off, like it was a taboo 
subject," Sgt. Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug's history is much more accessible. Born on July 2, 1942, to Floyd and 
Nancy Ridenour, Doug grew up in Piqua, Ohio, with a brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very proud of him, and I still am," Floyd Ridenour, 69, said in a 
telephone interview from his home in Troy, Ohio. "He was a nice boy; I had no 
problems with him. He was popular in high school and college." 
</P>
<P>
He had a traditional upbringing. His parents took the kids to a Methodist 
church, played Santa Claus on Christmas and voted Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Doug inherited his mother's good-natured disposition, Ridenour said, wryly 
adding: "Even though she was extremely beautiful, she was so nice that she 
didn't intimidate anyone -- except me." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Ridenour also passed down to her son an intense dread of aging. 
</P>
<P>
"She studied her face in the mirror every morning to see if she had a new 
wrinkle," said Floyd Ridenour, a retired plumber. "I had no inkling that Doug 
had the same fear. He'd talked about it with Ronald, but never with me." 
</P>
<P>
When their marriage unraveled, Floyd and Nancy Ridenour waited until their 
children left home before splitting up. Doug, who had attended the University 
of Dayton and the Dayton Art Institute, was 23 and working as a graphics 
illustrator in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, our kids didn't like the idea of us getting a divorce, but it 
didn't upset them to the point where they took sides," Floyd Ridenour said. His 
ex-wife soon thereafter remarried and moved to Los Angeles, where she got a job 
as a bookkeeper at the renowned Cocoanut Grove night club. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Doug also decided to go west. He told his plan to Dana Sue Houser, a 
secretary at his office. She replied that she, coincidentally, was 
California-bound as well. "They looked each other up when they got out there," 
Floyd Ridenour said. 
</P>
<P>
The sweethearts moved in together in 1968. They married two years later at the 
high-volume Bride's Choice Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Doug's mother died of heart failure in 1980. At 56, she was much too young for 
such a fate by most people's standards. But by her son's standards -- those 
expressed on his videotape -- she had passed the intolerable milestone of 50. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, Doug and Dana dropped anchor at a Santa Ana apartment 
complex -- The Islander -- a sprawling maze of bungalows lushly landscaped with 
tropical plants and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
There the couple remained for 17 years, until they bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for such an inseparable pair, they saw little of each other on 
weekdays. Throughout most of their marriage, Dana worked 8 to 5, while Doug 
clocked in at 9 p.m. and returned the next morning in time to have breakfast 
with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Other than during visits from Ronald or Floyd Ridenour, Doug and Dana 
socialized only with each other. Their entertainment consisted of dining out 
and watching television, Floyd said; they shunned travel. 
</P>
<P>
An elaborate TV aerial that Doug installed still looms above their Santa Ana 
apartment. In the den of their Anaheim home, Sgt. Barry said, they had two 
televisions with head sets -- presumably so they could listen to different 
channels in each other's presense. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't need friends," Doug's father said. "They weren't at all odd; they 
just thought there were a lot of bad apples out there and they were happy being 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did they have much use for children. "They were very verbal with everyone 
in the office about the fact that they'd never wanted kids," said real estate 
agent Judy Dillavou. 
</P>
<P>
They focused their affection on their dogs. "Doug always loved animals," Floyd 
Ridenour said. "He thought hunting was cruel. In his later years, he even 
thought fishing was cruel." 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Erna Lawson, a retired couple who have lived at The Islander for 
years, echoed the common perception that their former next-door neighbors were 
"reclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"We seldom saw her (Dana)," Erna Lawson said. "Whenever we did, she looked 
beautiful. She had an old-fashioned hairstyle -- teased, locked into place. We 
never saw her in slacks or shorts; she wore a dress and high heels even on 
weekends." 
</P>
<P>
The Ridenours always owned two poodles, neighbors said. But the dogs were kept 
out of sight and out of sound; they rarely were taken for walks, and their 
vocal chords had been cut to prevent them from barking. 
</P>
<P>
Although Doug and Dana "stayed to themselves," they were cordial when greeted. 
"He was constantly polishing his car in the parking lot," Richard Lawson said. 
"We would have conversations about the apartment complex. He thought that it 
went downhill once it was no longer adults-only. He seemed very nice." 
</P>
<P>
Al DeSpain, manager of Industrial Publications and Graphics, recalled that Doug 
could be annoyingly chipper. "It drove me up the wall," he said. "Doug would 
get on my case for being pessimistic -- and I would tell him that I'm not a 
pessimist, I'm a realist." 
</P>
<P>
In their 15-year-plus acquaintence, Doug scarcely aged at all, DeSpain said: 
"I'm a year younger than Doug was, and I watched myself grow older while he 
just stayed the same. He reminded me of Fabian." 
</P>
<P>
Within the span of about 18 months, Doug and Dana Ridenour's regimented 
existence took a few wide turns. 
</P>
<P>
They quit predictable jobs that required little social interaction and braved a 
highly aggressive profession. 
</P>
<P>
They suddenly worked the same schedule -- side by side, no less. 
</P>
<P>
They bought a house, after saying for years that they didn't want the 
responsibility of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Doug and Dana did not take well to their new neighbors on South Dickel Street, 
nor their neighbors to them. "They would drive by and keep their eyes straight 
ahead so they wouldn't have to see you and acknowledge you were there," Sara 
Collins recalled. 
</P>
<P>
One time Doug yelled at Ed and Angie Rossol's 3-year-old daughter for 
trespassing on his front lawn. "It scared her -- she cried," Angie Rossol said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's symbiotic marriage made for an ideal sales team, Judy Dillavou 
said: "You could tell they were in love by the way one would stare at the other 
while he or she was talking. They never defied each other; they always 
validated what the other one said. They worked together well, and not every 
husband and wife can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Their indivisibility amused Dean Dillavou. "The message on their answering 
machine said, 'This is Doug, this is Dana. . . .' When they called into the 
office, they would get on the speaker phone together," he chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
Though Dana was less outgoing than Doug, Judy Dillavou said, she held her own: 
"She talked less than he did, but she wasn't shy. He had her on a pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, however, Dillavou recalled a conversation "that seems weirder 
now than it did at the time": 
</P>
<P>
"Doug said that he disconnected the oven so Dana wouldn't have to cook, because 
he wanted to be with her every minute of the day. I asked her, 'But don't you 
miss baking?' She just said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was an odd concession for a woman who, in her father-in-law's memory, "loved 
to cook." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people can get in a delusional system together that is so airtight 
they don't need anything or anyone else," said UCLA psychiatrist Mark Goulston, 
who does "psychological autopsies" of suicide victims for their survivors. 
"It's as if two people have become a single, autonomous person." 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon, known as folie a deux -- double insanity -- "can give the two 
people a grand feeling of superiority," Goulston said. "But when they have to 
react with the rest of the world, the drop from feeling gigantic to feeling 
puny can be dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Some weeks after the Ridenours filmed their joint farewell, Doug tacked a solo 
message onto the tape. He did not specify the date, but enough time had elapsed 
since April 19 for him to grow the beard he had when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Doug's rambling 15-minute epilogue to his brother left no doubt that the end 
was at hand, police said. He seemed distraught, nervous and sad. 
</P>
<P>
"He got choked up when he was talking about the dogs," Barry recalled. "He said 
something to the effect of, 'We're taking the dogs with us -- they'd want it 
that way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Again Doug praised Dana for her devotion, allowing that he had "some different 
qualities" about himself that most people would find difficult to accept. But 
in their 22-year relationship, he said, he and his wife had never had a major 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Then Doug gave detailed and often repetitive instructions to his brother about 
funeral arrangements. He and Dana already had paid a Santa Ana mortuary for 
cremation services, Doug said. 
</P>
<P>
"He stressed that his brother's first responsibility, once he got the 
videotape, was to call the mortuary and tell them to go pick up the bodies," 
Barry said. "I guess that he naively assumed there wouldn't be a police 
investigation or autopsies." 
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Doug Ridenour assigned his brother one last responsibility: to 
safeguard his and Dana's appearance: 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody asks, tell them we were happy."

A CO-OP CHOPPER? CITIES GIVE IT A WHIRL AT DEALERS' EXPENSE; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEILLANCE: HUNTINGTON PARK, BELL, MAYWOOD AND SOUTH GATE WILL SPEND ABOUT 
$72,000 IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO LEASE A HELICOPTER TO TRACK DRUG SUSPECTS 
FROM THE AIR. IT COULD PAY OFF -- BIG.

<P>
Huntington Park, Bell, Maywood and South Gate are pooling their resources to 
lease a helicopter to help their detectives track down major drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The cities plan to spend about $72,000 in the next six months on the 
helicopter, which will be used primarily to track suspected drug dealers over 
city streets and area freeways. It also could be used for general 
crime-fighting in the cities if needed, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are hoping that the helicopter will lead to more drug busts and 
more federal forfeiture money for their police departments. Local police 
departments receive a share of cash seized during federal drug investigations, 
based on the help they provide to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter should take to the air in the next month if leasing talks are 
successful, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Each city will contribute about $18,000 in drug forfeiture money to pay for the 
helicopter and pilot. Federal guidelines require that cities use forfeiture 
money for police purposes. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of six months, the cities will decide whether the helicopter is 
worth the expense. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take too many major drug busts for us to make a profit on the 
situation," Huntington Park Mayor Thomas E. Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The four cities have combined forces in the last several years to work with 
federal agents on drug investigations that often lead outside city boundaries. 
Their police departments contribute detectives to a joint investigative team 
called the South East Area Narcotics Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the cities received more than $1 million in forfeiture funds 
after their detectives played a major role in a 1989 investigation. More than 
21 tons of cocaine and about $10 million in cash were seized at a Sylmar 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the cities decided to use the helicopter after they met in July 
with officials of the U.S. Customs Service Office of Enforcement. Federal 
officials told council members from the cities that their narcotics enforcement 
team would not receive as many tips in the future unless they used a 
helicopter, Jackson said. Tips would instead be passed to law enforcement 
agencies that track drug dealers with choppers. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives our team equal footing," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Maywood Police Chief Ted Heidke said the helicopter will enable detectives to 
track tricky dealers who try to evade capture by driving at high speed and 
making sudden turns. 
</P>
<P>
"You're trying to follow some crook, who many times is doing 80 m.p.h. on the 
freeway and watching for people following him," Heidke said. "We found in too 
many cases (his officers) end up losing the guy." 
</P>
<P>
In these times of tight budgets, the forfeiture funds offer the four 
departments a chance to hire more officers and buy expensive new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Financially troubled Huntington Park, for example, plans to spend about $1.2 
million in drug forfeiture money in the next year to hire seven more sworn 
officers and six other police employees and to buy new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park City Council decided to use the forfeiture money after 
voters last year rejected a proposed 7% utility tax that would have raised 
money for more police. 
</P>
<P>
If the flow of forfeiture money stops, the city will have to lay off the 
additional police employees, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility we will get more drug forfeiture money, which will 
pay, we hope, for the helicopter and much, much more," Jackson said.

JOB-TRAINING AGENCY'S SUIT ACCUSES 3 OF BILKING $39,000; THEY DENY IT, BLAME

<P>
A Cudahy city councilman and a community college trustee have been named in a 
civil suit alleging that they and one other person misused money from a 
nonprofit agency that trains and finds jobs for needy residents in five 
southeast area cities. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit filed by the agency last month in Norwalk Superior Court, 
Councilman John O. Robertson Jr., Rio Hondo Community College board Trustee 
Ralph Pacheco and Maynard Law, former executive director of the Hub Cities 
Consortium, bilked the consortium of $39,000 from August, 1988, to February of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, Pacheco, Robertson and Law said they are bewildered by 
the charges, and all three vehemently denied being involved in a scheme to 
defraud the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this," said Pacheco, whose Whittier-based management 
consultant firm is also named in the suit. "What kind of madness has come over 
the board and staff members at Hub Cities?" 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that no facts support the consortium's allegation that the three 
took the money for personal use and that the suit was generated by political 
foes on and off the consortium board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard about any problems," he said. "The board and staff never 
gave me the courtesy of a phone call or a letter. I could have explained the 
whole thing in three minutes, but they have never bothered to ask me. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to ask why did they just walk in with a lawsuit when they could 
have made a couple of a phone calls? It's a farce. This is all politics." 
</P>
<P>
Law said the charges are "beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Law and Robertson, who once served as chairman of the 
board of the Hub Cities Consortium, signed checks totaling $39,000 to Pacheco 
after Pacheco's contract as a management consultant for the agency expired. The 
suit further alleges that the three men conspired to defraud the consortium by 
hiding the payments to Pacheco from the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"The checks were cashed without being brought before the board for our 
approval," said Lynwood Mayor Robert Henning, who is also chairman of the 
board. "There was something wrong going on that the board members did not 
approve of, and we want our money back." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kennelly, executive director of the agency, said the board realized that 
the money was missing after the board received its annual audit. The audit 
turned up canceled checks in $3,000 or $6,000 amounts, written after Pacheco's 
contract expired, and signed by Law and Robertson, Kennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Three checks were written totaling $12,000 for an economic development study 
that the board had asked Pacheco to conduct in January, 1989. But, Kennelly 
said, no contract for the study can be found, and Pacheco has yet to give the 
board such a study. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kennelly said, none of the checks written to Pacheco ever appeared 
on the item-by-item list of checks that must be approved by directors at each 
monthly board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also reported that Pacheco's original contract, which showed an 
expiration date of July, 1988, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco was given a one-year contract to oversee the formation of the Hub 
Cities Consortium in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my baby," Pacheco said of the consortium. "It is the irony of all 
ironies that the person responsible for taking an idea and making it a reality 
is now being accused of receiving funds for services not rendered. It's kind of 
like kicking Henry Ford out of the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco said that six months after his original contract with the agency 
expired in July, 1988, he received a new contract to begin the economic 
development study. The $3,000 payments are his monthly retainer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco said he never completed the economic development study, because midway 
through the year -- "unbeknownst to the majority of the board and some internal 
staff" -- he was asked by Law and Robertson to begin work on an application to 
the state to receive agency funding directly from the state rather than from 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no written contract for the services but that the board 
had earlier budgeted $40,000 for such services. Pacheco said he worked on the 
application until February of this year, when Gov. George Deukmejian denied the 
consortium's request. 
</P>
<P>
In April, shortly after the audit was released, Law resigned, Kennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson was removed from the board by the Cudahy City Council after the April 
municipal election and was replaced by Mayor Joseph Graffio, once one of 
Robertson's political allies but now one of his most severe critics. 
</P>
<P>
Kennelly said he wrote to Pacheco twice after the audit was completed to demand 
an accounting of the missing money. In August, with no satisfactory response 
from Pacheco, the board voted, 5 to 0, to file suit against Pacheco, Law and 
Robertson, Kennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the reason that neither he nor any of the board members has ever asked 
Robertson or Law why the payments were made is because the checks had been made 
out to Pacheco, so "he is the one that should have the documentation, the 
contracts, the work that they did for us." 
</P>
<P>
"We just want Pacheco to produce the contract or the documents showing he did 
work for us or else give us back the money," Kennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks damages totaling $200,000 and attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hub Cities Consortium was the focus of another controversy 
when the Los Angeles County Private Industry Council, which oversees the 
funding of the consortium, asked for substantiation of the number of people the 
agency claimed to have trained. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium -- which is made up of Maywood, Cudahy, Lynwood, South Gate and 
Huntington Park -- receives about $4,000 in federal funding for every resident 
it serves. That money is distributed through the state and county to local 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The agency eventually satisfied the county's demand and produced documentation 
that proved it had served as many residents as reported, but the incident 
brought scrutiny of the agency's administration, southeast area city officials 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Bell -- a founding city in the consortium -- pulled out to join the 
West San Gabriel Valley Consortium. In a resolution passed at the time, city 
officials said the Hub Cities consortium "had not fulfilled the expectations of 
the city."

VAN DE KAMP IS OPPOSED, BUT PIKE PLANNERS VOW TO PROCEED

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the state attorney general's sudden leap into a yearlong legal fight to 
block a complex at the former site of the Pike amusement park, developers are 
vowing to go "right straight ahead" with work on one of the nation's largest 
renewal endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin by the end of next year on the oceanfront 
3-million-acre, $900-million "city-within-a-city," described by City Hall as 
the centerpiece of a downtown renaissance -- and by critics as an assault on 
the local environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going right straight ahead with the project," said Wayne Ratkovich, one 
of several influential developers for the Pike project. "We are not hesitating 
for a moment. We have a very low regard for the attorney general's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich was responding to a friend-of-the-court opinion filed last week by 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who said the city violated in environmental 
laws when it approved the Pike plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
The brief was a boost to 800 members of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and 
other area watchdog groups that have sued to stop the project, which would 
include 250 condominium units, a 300-suite hotel and 200,000 square feet of 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the project and other downtown developments will attract 
thousands of cars, pollute the air and turn surrounding neighborhoods into 
"freeway off-ramps." 
</P>
<P>
The critics lost in a trial earlier this year, then turned to the state Court 
of Appeal, where Van de Kamp's opinion will be considered along with volumes of 
evidence. A hearing date is pending. 
</P>
<P>
But Ratkovich -- an influential businessman known for restoring the Wiltern 
Theatre complex and other historic buildings in Los Angeles -- said he is 
confident that the lawsuit will ultimately fail and that Long Beach will see 
the completion of a development that has been likened to Embarcadero Center in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine," Ratkovich said, "that an attorney general of any state is so 
wise and so all-seeing and all-knowing that he has . . . greater wisdom than 
the citizens of Long Beach, the (city) Planning Commission, the Redevelopment 
Agency, the state Coastal Commission and the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say a nest of downtown buildings already approved by the city would 
bring 114,000 more cars into town daily -- more than one-third of them 
generated by the Pike project. (That figure does not take into account the 
resort and theme park proposal that was recently unveiled by Walt Disney Co., 
which could attract 13 million tourists a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and others argue that the city broke the law 
by failing to consider the total of environmental damage that mammoth 
development could bring -- further stressing Ocean Boulevard, 7th Street, 
Broadway and other beleaguered east-west corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those streets are already crowded," Long Beach Area Citizens Involved attorney 
Marc Allen Coleman said. "Where are they going to put 114,000 more cars? The 
law says you cannot approve a project until these kinds of problems are 
mitigated. I can't believe they are planning a city this way." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and developers contend that environmental problems have been 
considered and that steps have been taken to make sure Long Beach can absorb 
such impacts, not to mention the wealth of tax revenue new development would 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Shirey said: "We recognize that whether it be 
Disney or the Pike project or somebody who wants to expand a hot dog stand, 
there will be traffic issues. But we think people underestimate the ability of 
the current transportation system to handle traffic in Long Beach . . . and 
they underestimate our resolve to make sure those problems are worked out." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are confident that the Pike project will ultimately go forward. 
But, they wonder, when? 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Pike were unveiled with great fanfare two years ago. But the land 
south of Ocean Boulevard between Magnolia and Pine avenues remains an ugly 
patchwork of vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for downtown," Community Development Director Susan Shick 
said, "so we would like to see it started. A major project is always better 
under construction than simply talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Shick and others looked to the slumping economy, the savings and loan crisis 
and a general "real estate trough" to explain the apparent delay. 
</P>
<P>
But developers said the project is not behind schedule at all, just moving 
steadily through a maze of conditions to put together a virtually 
self-contained community of homes, shops, hotel rooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich said: "The architects are hard at work, and there are armies of 
engineers gathering in Long Beach as we speak. There is an enormous amount of 
work to do on a project this size." 
</P>
<P>
After the project won full approval last year, developers retained New 
York-based Salomon Bros. Inc. to help them market the idea in what is now a 
global search for investors. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hart, manager of Pike Properties Associates, would not discuss financing 
details, other than to say it is going "very well." Pike Properties -- a 
partnership of the Ratkovich Co., Enterprise Development Co. of Columbia, Md., 
and Copley Real Estate Advisers of Boston -- bought the site in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the real estate slump would not affect a project of this size, which 
would be built over 15 years and through two or three real estate cycles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with investors who have the capacity to invest in a $900-million 
project," Hart said. "These are people with a very long-term view. We're not 
selling a building that will be occupied tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the project's four phases will be decided according to the demands of 
the market of the day, Hart said.

MALL SITE AN OLD BURIAL GROUND, INDIANS CLAIM; 
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER: THE CITY COUNCIL AGREED TO HIRE AN ARCHEOLOGIST TO SEARCH THE TRACT 
EARMARKED FOR A $20-MILLION SHOPPING CENTER.

<P>
City officials said they will ask an archeologist to examine the site of a 
proposed $20-million shopping center to see whether it contains an Indian 
burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
An archeological find in the vicinity of the abandoned Southern Pacific train 
depot could stall and even endanger a commercial project that the city has 
planned for 12 years and floated $7 million in bonds to help finance. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying by two Indians prompted the city's move. The 16-acre triangular site, 
about a mile east of the San Gabriel River Freeway, is the likely location of 
an Indian burial ground and should rest undisturbed, said Jimi Castillo and 
Lupe Lopez, cousins-in-law who trace their ancestry to Southern California 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
After initial surprise and skepticism, the city is taking the issue seriously 
and has invited an Irvine environmental firm, LSA Associates, to bid on an 
archeological study of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of further delays comes just as the shopping center cleared two 
major hurdles. At its Tuesday meeting, the city's Redevelopment Agency approved 
the building and landscaping design. 
</P>
<P>
Next, agency members unanimously approved a proposal that will settle, for the 
time being, the issue of what to do with the 100-year-old depot on the site. 
The station, a national historic landmark, will be moved to a Penn Street lot 
owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. Leasing the land will cost the city $700 a 
year; moving the depot will cost $34,730. Many preservationists who lobbied to 
save the depot have said they accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Cunningham, the city's assistant city manager for community development, 
said he hopes the city can also resolve the burial ground issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication of any historic or archeological artifacts on the 
site," he said. "And we base that on two previous evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the UCLA Archeological Information Center surveyed its archival 
collection of published accounts and records and found no mention of a village 
or burial ground at the depot site. Whittier commissioned the first study when 
it targeted the Whittier Boulevard area for redevelopment in 1978. The second 
study was part of a street-widening project near the Whittier Quad shopping 
area earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, a large archeological site doesn't escape the eyes of archeologists 
and researchers," said Brian Glenn, the center's acting coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not documented any remains at that location. That doesn't mean they 
don't exist. It simply means that whatever documentation is available is not on 
file at our office." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn noted that the depot vicinity had been a highly developed commercial and 
residential area for years and that an earlier site could have been destroyed 
without proper documentation before preservation became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more names of villages than we have places located," he said. "A great 
number of villages are probably fully destroyed under Los Angeles. But there's 
also an excellent chance that some sites are preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 53 and a Gabrielino Indian who lives in South Whittier, said she has 
documentary evidence supporting her belief that one such Indian burial ground 
lies under or near the depot. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez turned to page 210 of a 1978 edition of "Chinigchinich," a book little 
known outside of Indian and archeological circles. 
</P>
<P>
The title refers to the name of a prophet figure for the local tribes, 
anthropology consultant Chester King said. 
</P>
<P>
The book's author was missionary Geronimo Boscana. More than 150 years ago, 
Father Boscana, writing in Spanish, recorded his observations of the "beliefs, 
usages, customs and extravagancies" of local Indians. His notes were translated 
into English and published in 1846. 
</P>
<P>
Later, ethnographer John Harrington, starting about 1913, annotated Boscana's 
work. One such note refers to an Indian burial ground: 
</P>
<P>
"In the vicinity of the Southern Pacific junction tower, which stands in the 
western angle of the crossing of the Whittier spur of the Southern Pacific with 
the Santa Fe Railway, there is another Indian graveyard. A Mr. Cooper tried to 
make a cesspool there and found the ground full of Indian bones." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Castillo believe that Whittier's depot is what the text calls the 
Southern Pacific junction tower. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials, based on UCLA research, disagreed, placing the possible 
burial ground south of Whittier, in the northern part of Santa Fe Springs. That 
section of Santa Fe Springs contains a few houses, a sandwich stand and 
industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Powell, city manager of Santa Fe Springs, said he cannot recall 
construction in that area that would have required deep excavation. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, like Lopez, places little faith in expert opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials "kept telling me they would go ahead with the development," 
Castillo said. "I decided to come forward and protect my ancestors' burial 
sites. According to our faith, the development would disturb the spirits of our 
ancestors, which in turn would disturb the spirits of the living." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, 47, an unemployed cabinetmaker, said he only recently began studying 
his Indian heritage after a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that he said 
wrecked his marriage and separated him from his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been sober," the Whittier native said, "I've been getting back into 
my culture and everything." 
</P>
<P>
He recently entered the depot site, he said, to conduct a religious ceremony 
that involved burning sweet grass and sage. "I felt a spiritual belonging, 
almost a feeling of being at home. I looked behind my left boot, and there 
lying on the ground was a tail feather of a red-tailed hawk, which I believe 
was a sign." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials have privately expressed skepticism about the burial 
ground, wondering whether the issue represented a last-ditch effort by 
activists who opposed moving the depot or disliked the shopping center project. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo acknowledged sympathy with residents who want the depot to stay put: 
"I am for preserving history. I would prefer to see the depot refurbished where 
it sits, and perhaps plant some green grass around it, and put in walkways and 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Jeanette McKenna, a supporter of Castillo's efforts, has also 
opposed moving the depot and approving the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the (shopping center) design reflects the community of 
Whittier," she said. "It doesn't reflect a small Quaker town. It's more 
designed for an open area of Orange County, with lots of stucco and blank wall 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the developer, Encino-based Urbatec, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If remains are found, the first person with jurisdiction is the county coroner, 
who would make sure that the corpse is not recent. The coroner would then 
contact the Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento, which would 
search for what it terms "the most likely descendants." 
</P>
<P>
There are about five such designated Gabrielino descendants in Los Angeles 
County. Castillo is one of up to 3,000 identified Gabrielinos in Southern 
California who do not yet have that designation. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielino Indians got their name from their close association with the San 
Gabriel Mission. Their most direct ancestors may have migrated here up to 3,000 
years ago, said anthropological consultant King, whose dissertation work was on 
local tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mission era in the late 1700s, he said, there was about one Indian 
village per six square miles in the Los Angeles Basin. Communities ranged from 
15 to 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
He also estimates that there was a stable population of 3,000 Gabrielino 
Indians until diseases imported by colonists decimated them. 
</P>
<P>
The missionaries turned the Indians, who were hunter/gatherers, into farmers 
and cattle herders, King said, adding that Indians were pressed to leave behind 
native cultural practices and abandon villages and burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said: "Rather than be known as Indians, which at the time was lower than 
dirt, they became Mexican or Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there was not much respect for Indian burial grounds either, 
said Larry Myers, the executive secretary of the state's Native American 
Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian burial grounds were not treated the same as other burial grounds. 
There's been a tremendous amount of desecration," he said, not only by 
developers but by museums that have collected Indian bones. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, it is a felony to willfully destroy Indian remains in a 
burial site. Most often, descendants reach a compromise with a developer to 
relocate the bones, bury them deeper at the site or build around them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mediators that will work with tribes and developers to take care of 
both interests," City Councilman Bob Henderson said. "It's one of those things 
that is going to have to be checked."

A Long Beach businessman carrying $184,000 in checks and cash was robbed 
outside a bank in Paramount by a lone gunman who escaped in a car, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was not released, was about to deposit the money Tuesday 
morning when he was accosted in the parking lot of a Bank of America branch on 
Paramount Boulevard, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no arrests, said sheriff's Sgt. Ray Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old victim had just gotten out of his car with the bank bag when he 
was grabbed from behind and threatened with a gun, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect put a short-barreled blue steel revolver to the businessman's head 
and stated, 'Give me the bag or I'll blow your head off,' " Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The man surrendered the bag and the assailant jumped into a late-model white 
car and fled. No shots were fired.

WOMAN'S FIRING DUE TO IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am often enraged by articles written in daily newspapers, but never have felt 
the need to express my anger with written comment. 
</P>
<P>
The story on Diane De Vries ("Disabled Worker Claims Job Bias," Times, Aug. 23) 
is not to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
This courageous lady is a victim of an ignorance that even in these unsettled 
times is hard to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
We can only have admiration for this fine woman, who earned her degree under 
what must have been the most difficult of circumstances, choosing then to enter 
the work force and live a life independent of unearned subsidies. I'm willing 
to bet that Ms. De Vries enjoyed the struggle toward her goal and the eventual 
freedom it brought her.

EDUCATION: THE SCHOOL BOARD SELECTION OF A BLACK SUPERINTENDENT REFLECTS THE 
PANEL'S RACIAL IMBALANCE, THE BOARD'S CRITICS SAY. SIX OF SEVEN TRUSTEES ARE

Latino leaders say the Compton school board's recent appointment of J. L. Handy 
as superintendent is one more example of the "systematic discrimination" 
against Latinos in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos campaigned for acting superintendent Elisa L. Sanchez to be promoted to 
the top job. But the Board of Trustees last month selected Handy, who is black, 
to head the Compton Unified School District. Six of the seven trustees are 
black; the other is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez will return to her previous job as deputy superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"What qualifications does he have that she doesn't?" asked Joseph Ochoa, a 
veteran Latino activist. "She's been there three or four years. She balanced 
the budget. You can see it's discrimination. What else is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Kelvin D. Filer vehemently denied that the board chose Handy because he 
is black: "Race had nothing to do with the selection, absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He said Handy impressed the board with his knowledge and understanding of the 
district, did his homework and is known as an administrator able to remedy 
troublesome situations. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the Latino community and the black-controlled school district 
and black-run city government have been escalating as the city's Latino 
population and school enrollment increase. 
</P>
<P>
In the district last year, 50.3% of the enrollment was Latino, and that 
percentage is expected to increase. Five years ago, Latino enrollment was 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Latino teachers and administrators represent less than 4% of the educational 
staff in the schools. And only about 9% of city government workers are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos have been demanding that both the city and the school district form 
affirmative action plans for hiring, and parents want the school district to 
hire more Spanish-speaking teachers. The parents complain that their children 
are being taught largely by Spanish-speaking classroom aides. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they are forced to rely heavily on aides because they 
cannot find enough bilingual teachers to serve the 8,000 children in the 
26,000-student district who need bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Some black trustees and educators are openly hostile to the idea of having to 
spend shrinking budget dollars on bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders also said they complained for years about conditions at 
Jefferson Elementary School, a dilapidated facility on the city's north side, 
one of the oldest Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
All but about 50 of the nearly 700 children at Jefferson are Latino. Most of 
the students attended class in old portable buildings that were so deteriorated 
that the school board this summer ordered them bulldozed. New portables are 
being moved onto the site in time for the first day of school, Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
After Handy's appointment was announced, Ochoa said that Latino parents should 
consider protesting by keeping their children out of school for three or four 
days. "It would bankrupt them," Ochoa said of the financially strapped 
district. 
</P>
<P>
State aid received by Compton and other districts is based average daily 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (district officials) could have gotten anybody more qualified 
than Mrs. Sanchez," said another activist, Gorgonio Sanchez, who is not related 
to Elisa Sanchez. "I think they're concerned more with political control of the 
district than with the quality of education." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Pallon, a local bakery owner active in the Latino Chamber of Commerce, 
said about Elisa Sanchez: "She balanced the budget. Here we're getting an 
outsider, someone who doesn't know the issues, (or how) the district is 
politically divided. She knows all this. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we get a good person in a position (to move up), right away for 
some reason or other they get either bypassed or demoted." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was named acting superintendent early this year when Ted D. Kimbrough 
left to head the Chicago school system. During the last seven months she 
steered the district through a difficult budget crunch that necessitated 
layoffs. She was on vacation this week and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez came to the district in 1983 as an associate superintendent and was 
later made deputy, largely overseeing all the instructional and curricula 
issues. She holds a master's degree in education from San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Handy holds a master's degree from San Jose State University and received his 
Ph.D. from the University of La Verne in 1987. He has been a school principal 
and was assistant superintendent in Sacramento for the last two years.

Photo, Hot Wheels in South Gate: Employees of Imperial Tire Co. in South Gate 
try to salvage a tool chest from the smoldering wreckage of a two-alarm fire 
that destroyed eight installation bays and their contents of tires and rims 
early Wednesday morning. The fire, which closed Imperial Highway for several 
hours and pumped a plume of black smoke high into the air, slowed traffic on 
the Long Beach Freeway and caused an estimated $300,000 in damage. County fire 
investigators were trying to determine the cause of the blaze. The business, on 
Imperial Highway a few blocks east of the Long Beach Freeway, is owned by Dale 
Robertson of La Mirada. SARAH M. BROWN / For The Times

Prime Ticket's viewing choices. The service's most ambitious project is "Prime 
Ticket Press Box," a daily live half-hour sports news show set to air at 10 
p.m. beginning Oct. 15. Prime Ticket expects to add a 7 p.m. broadcast in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket's partnership with regional sports networks throughout the nation 
provide it with many other live events, topped by college football and 
basketball and professional tennis. The service also has moved up its weekend 
sign-on to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel 
</P>
<P>
The youngest Southland regional sports service has augmented its programming by

</P>
<P>
Several made-for-pay-per-view events are on the horizon, including the return 
of the "One-on-One Collegiate Challenge" basketball tournament with top college 
stars. A home run contest with top major leaguers is in the talking stages.

WHEN HARRY MET IRVING . . . THE ROOMMATE ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN DE WOLFE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The nights bothered me. Not because I was afraid but because I felt depressed 
and lonely. I looked around and no one was there," said Irving Tarnol, a 
sprightly 87-year-old. "After I lost my wife of 54 years, what I missed the 
most was companionship," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnol thinks he found the best solution when Harry Roberts, 72, moved in a few 
months ago to share his two-bedroom condo in Van Nuys. The two were matched 
through Alternative Living for the Aging, a nonprofit agency that assists the 
elderly with their housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry and I are worlds apart," Tarnol said, "but I'm lucky to have him for a 
roommate. He's a nice, quiet, gentle man. I had a couple of roommates before 
him but they didn't work out. I even tried a lady roommate but she wanted to 
reform me. I'm too independent." 
</P>
<P>
Both agree that the things that set them apart, may well add up to a plus in 
compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Irving is outgoing and takes an interest in more things than I do. He plays 
cards with friends. I don't dig that. We do our own thing," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to read. I'm more introverted and shy. I take things as they come but 
I'm no pussycat. I fight back when necessary," said the former musician. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnol, who just had his driver's license renewed for another four years, 
describes himself as a bit short-tempered and impatient. "Harry takes things as 
they come. I like to do things too quickly. Sometimes I forget I'm 87 years. At 
84, I was still working four hours a day for my grandson. But, since I now have 
a pacemaker, I'm learning to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
Irving is organized and methodical even when he cooks, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"No frozen meals for me. I cook a full meal in about 30 minutes because I 
prepare everything ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll eat anything Irving fixes," said an appreciative Roberts. "Irving's a 
pretty good cook." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the roommates were at the peak of their respective 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnol -- who emigrated from his native Russia in 1920, raised six children and 
now has 18 grandchildren and a second great-grandchild on the way -- was 
running his own successful wholesale laundry and dry cleaning business in the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
"I had between 80 and 100 employees. I was always surrounded by activity, 
family doings and with my wife's involvement with charitable organizations," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a featured orchestra musician for most of his life -- with a talent 
for a variety of reed instruments -- spent most of the 1970s aboard luxury 
ocean liners entertaining passengers on Mediterranean and Middle-East cruises. 
Previously, he had been a staff musician for radio stations in his native 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who has two children and a grandchild, eventually settled in 
California, where his wife died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to travel back East each year on my vacation, and usually had a gig or 
two booked there to cover my expenses. One day my brother, who was a booking 
agent, said: 'Sorry, Harry, I can't get you any work. You're good but you look 
too old.' Instead of getting angry at him. I laughed. He was right. I sold my 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
On their 5Oth wedding anniversary, Irving and Lillian Tarnol received a 
handsome gift from their six children. 
</P>
<P>
"They all got together and gave us this condo. After my wife died, I told my 
children I was too independent to live with any of them. I'd made up my mind 
that as long as I could take care of myself, that's how I wanted to live -- in 
my own home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Tarnol have a simple living arrangement. Each has his own bedroom 
and bath, at opposite ends of the living and dining areas, with light buttons 
installed so that either one may alert the other in an emergency. Each has his 
own TV set, although they sometimes watch a program together in the living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Both manage well on their monthly Social Security check. Roberts, who says he 
could not possibly afford an apartment on his own, pays $300 for his share of 
housing; Tarnol pays for the utilities and both share the cost of the food and 
a cleaning woman every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tarnol is an amiable host who keeps a full bar for friends who may drop by for 
a drink. "And I never have to mark the bottles, 'cause Harry doesn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
"All either one of us really needs is having another human being around," 
Tarnol said. "Someone who will laugh if you think of something funny to say or 
who will occasionally share their feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts agreed. "Yes, it does chase away the loneliness." 
</P>

THE MOST POPULAR HOUSING CHOICE OF AMERICAN'S ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
STAYING PUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hortense Tingstad's husband died of Alzheimer's disease in 1982, she 
thought that most of her life's major decisions were behind her. 
</P>
<P>
She had accepted the task of caring for a husband who often didn't recognize 
her after his condition was diagnosed as the memory-killing illness several 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But when he finally tried to choke her to death in a fit of dementia, she made 
the painful decision to move him from their Mid-Wilshire home of 40 years to a 
hospital, where he could get more professional treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After Edward Tingstad was buried, though, Hortense was faced with yet another 
difficult decision: Where would she spend the rest of her life? 
</P>
<P>
A convalescent home was out. Even now, at 81, she's in fine shape. She pondered 
moving to a resort-type development chock-full of golf courses and the like, 
but soon rejected that notion because she "didn't want to hang around with a 
bunch of old people." 
</P>
<P>
She still occasionally thinks of moving to a condominium, but doesn't like the 
thought of giving up her own yard and some of her privacy. An apartment is 
definitely out of the question: After being a homeowner for nearly half a 
century, she's not about to go back to renting. 
</P>
<P>
"So I've just stayed put," said Tingstad, a chipper, energetic woman who only 
recently mothballed her racy 1964 Porsche and started driving a sedan. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this old house, and it's so full of happy memories. I might just stay 
here until I turn 100." 
</P>
<P>
Tingstad's story illustrates some of the many housing choices open to the 
nation's 41 million people aged 60 or older, about three-quarters of whom are 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly where to live when we get older is a question all of us must face 
sooner or later. If you have already retired, or expect to leave the work force 
soon, it's a decision you need to be thinking about now. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you're middle-aged, a little planning today could let you live out 
your retirement years more comfortably than you would if you waited until the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't want to think about where you'll live several years from now, 
you may have to address the elderly housing issue if you have parents who are 
in their 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, experts say older people should seek the input of their children when 
</P>
<P>
they're making their housing decisions and that the kids should volunteer to 
become involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you move or stay put, the choice you make will affect the entire 
family," said Leah Dobkin, a housing specialist with the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ultimately your decision, but bringing the kids in on the conversation 
can be a real help." 
</P>
<P>
Never before have older people had so many housing options. Hundreds of 
communities for so-called "active adults" have sprung up around the country, 
with golf courses, pools and classes on everything from sewing to woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
Other new developments cater to older people who want smaller homes, but don't 
want all the recreational amenities offered at Sun City-type projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Congregate-care" facilities are geared toward older people who are generally 
healthy, but want a little help with cooking and housekeeping chores. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are nursing homes and convalescent hospitals, where residents 
have access to around-the-clock medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who decide to stay in their present homes now have a range of 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you could bring in a roommate to supplement your income and 
provide companionship. Or, if you need in-home medical attention, you can hire 
one of the 8,000 agencies that provide various types of nursing care and 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
If you're one of the 2 million or so Californians who have lots of equity and 
the home is nearly paid off, you might even consider a "reverse mortgage" -- an 
offbeat type of loan that can provide you with monthly stipends that don't have 
to be immediately repaid. 
</P>
<P>
But with all these options come some hard choices. 
</P>
<P>
No matter where you spend the rest of your life, you'll have to ask yourself 
some tough financial and lifestyle questions. The answers will help determine 
not just where you live, but how happy you'll be with your decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Go slow, and think everything out first," said Stan Ross, co-managing partner 
of the real estate consulting and accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're deciding where you're going to live for the rest of your life, you 
can't afford to make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers, accountants, financial and estate planners can provide valuable 
advice. So can the local chapter of the American Assn. of Retired Persons, 
which has a plethora of free and low-cost publications about housing 
alternatives for older people. 
</P>
<P>
Your physical condition will play a key role in your housing decision. 
</P>
<P>
If you're relatively healthy and mobile, there shouldn't be any problem with 
staying in your current home. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies have shown that between 75% and 85% of people over 60 would 
like to spend the rest of their lives where they are now, so long as they 
remain healthy and can continue making their housing payments and keeping the 
place up without much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even if you're a bit frail or are handicapped, you might be able to 
stay in your longtime home by making some alterations. 
</P>
<P>
"You can install 'grab bars' in the bathroom and other parts of the house for 
more support, or install automatic stair lifts so you don't have to walk up 
stairs," said Jon Pynoos, a professor of gerontology at USC's Andrus 
Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
"You can add more lighting so you can see better around the house, or even 
rearrange your floor plan so you only live on one floor or spend most of your 
time in one particular portion of the home." 
</P>
<P>
New products designed to help older people stay in their home with as much 
comfort as possible are being developed every month. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Canada-based Granberg Superior Systems recently unveiled a 
"movable" kitchen and bathroom for wheelchair-bound people: Cabinets, sinks and 
everything else can be automatically lowered or raised with the touch of a 
button. 
</P>
<P>
If you need nearly constant medical attention or your health is deteriorating, 
you may want to consider moving to a nursing home or continuing-care facility. 
About 3 million Americans live in 25,000 of these projects nationwide. They 
typically offer on-site medical care as well as meals and help with household 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
There are psychological considerations too. 
</P>
<P>
"If you move away from your neighborhood, you usually leave behind lots of 
friends and family members," said Dobkin, the AARP housing specialist. "Or you 
might not want to move if your house holds fond memories of a late spouse or 
your kids. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on how motivated you are to create new memories instead of just 
keeping the old ones. If you're not ready to meet new people and adjust to a 
new neighborhood, you're probably better off staying where you are now." 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to stay put, you'll still have plenty of decisions to make. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you're widowed or otherwise single, you might consider bringing 
in a roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"They could pay you rent to supplement your income, or they could do 
housekeeping or other chores in lieu of rent," said Janet Witkin of Alternative 
Living for the Aged, a nonprofit group that runs a roommate-matching service 
and builds co-op housing for older people. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, a roommate can give you companionship -- and you can't put a price tag 
on that, especially if you've been living alone." 
</P>
<P>
There are no firm estimates on the number of elderly people who live with a 
roommate. But Witkin's group alone has matched up more than 3,100 Angelenos 
over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, some drawbacks to sharing your home with someone else. 
Your privacy will likely be reduced, and there's a chance that the rent paid by 
your housemate may make you ineligible to receive other benefits, such as food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
A few cities even have zoning ordinances that put limitations on shared-housing 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, you simply might not get along with your roommate -- 
and that can cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to spend the rest of your days arguing with somebody, or go 
through the trauma of getting rid of a roommate who makes you feel 
uncomfortable in your own home," said Jacqueline Leavitt, an associate 
professor and expert on elderly housing in the UCLA School of Architecture and 
Urban Planning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all the more reason why you should get to know your (potential) 
roommate before you ask her to move in, and all the more reason why you should 
have a place in your home when you want to get away from it all. If you don't 
have any privacy, you'll go mad." 
</P>
<P>
The free roommate-matching programs operated by Alternative Living for the Aged 
and some other seniors' groups try to minimize potential problems by linking-up 
people with the same characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
They ask potential partners a variety of questions -- from whether they smoke 
to how late they stay up -- in an attempt to ensure compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
If finances will be tight in your retirement years or you simply want to live 
better, you can turn some of your built-up equity into cash by refinancing, or 
by taking out a home-equity loan or conventional second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, though, is that you may have trouble paying the money back. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, your income is probably going to be much lower because you won't be 
bringing home a weekly paycheck," said San Francisco-based financial planner 
Lawrence A. Krause. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you need in your retirement years is to fall behind on your 
mortgage payments and lose your house through foreclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Krause discourages many of his older clients from borrowing against their 
equity. "If they're strapped for cash, I suggest that they consider selling and 
moving to a smaller home, or to move to a less-expensive area." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like the thought of moving but want to supplement your retirement 
income, you can consider taking out a reverse mortgage. About 1,000 of these 
loans have been made in California and 5,000 have been made nationwide -- more 
than twice the number that had been originated just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A reverse mortgage is basically a home loan that works backwards. Instead of 
getting one lump sum that must be repaid in monthly installments, the loan is 
advanced in monthly increments. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on which type of reverse mortgage you select, the money won't have to 
be paid back until the term of the loan expires or you finally sell the home. 
If you die, the money is repaid by your estate. 
</P>
<P>
"People take out reverse mortgages for any number of reasons," said William J. 
Texido, whose San Francisco-based Providential Home Income Plan is one of 
California's biggest reverse-mortgage lenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Some do it to supplement their monthly income and live a little better, and 
others do it to pay medical bills or meet other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"And some folks just do it to have fun," Texido said. "We've got one couple 
that signed up for our program, and they use the money to rent an apartment in 
Paris for six months out of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, reverse mortgages aren't for everyone. Some companies charge high 
interest rates on the loans or demand to share in a portion of the property's 
future appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
People who want to leave as much as they can to their heirs also typically 
avoid reverse mortgages because they don't want profits from the eventual sale 
of the home to be reduced by the loan pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
A cheaper way to tap your equity is to enter a sale/lease-back transaction. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical sale/lease-back, you would sell your home to your grown child or 
even a private investor and simultaneously sign a lease to stay in your house 
for as long as you wish. 
</P>
<P>
As in a typical sale, the buyer would make a down payment and get a bank loan 
to finance the rest of the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
You would get to keep all the sale proceeds and might be eligible for the 
one-time exclusion that lets you pocket up to $125,000 of your profits 
tax-free. You would also have the psychological satisfaction of knowing that 
you can stay in the home for as long as you like. 
</P>
<P>
Your child, meantime, can collect monthly rental payments from you and take tax 
deductions that all landlords enjoy. And, of course, he'll also get the home 
when you move out or die. A sale/lease-back involves some important tax and 
legal issues, so you'll want to confer with a knowledgeable attorney and 
accountant before you enter one. 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Home Equity Conversion provides a guide to 
sale/lease-backs and a model agreement you can use to fashion your own 
contract: It's available for $35 from the nonprofit group's headquarters at 110 
E. Main Street, Madison, Wis. 53703 
</P>
<P>
Whether you stay put or move on, don't put yourself under too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you've got pressing medical problems or financial troubles, there's 
really no reason to rush your decision," said USC's Pynoos. "So go slow -- 
remember, there's always tomorrow."

HOT PROPERTY: 'DAYS OF THUNDER,' NIGHTS IN PALISADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOM CRUISE bought a home in Pacific Palisades just before he left for Australia 
last month on a vacation to meet the parents of his girlfriend and "Days of 
Thunder" co-star NICOLE KIDMAN. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise purchased a secluded, Colonial-style home with electric gates up a long, 
tree-lined driveway. He paid about $4.7 million, according to sources not 
involved in the deal. Title was taken in the name of a trust. 
</P>
<P>
Built in the early '40s, the two-story house was recently refurbished. It has 
five bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths and four fireplaces in slightly more than 6,200 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The home also has a dramatic, spiral staircase; wood-paneled library, two-story 
guest house, motor court, swimming pool, spa, cabana and English garden. 
</P>
<P>
The property had been co-listed by Joan McGoohan, Jon Douglas Co., and 
Micheline Swift and Lisa Duffy, Fred Sands Estates. McGoohan said that she 
could not divulge any details about the transaction, and the other realtors 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
ZSA ZSA GABOR and her husband, PRINCE FREDERICK VON ANHALT, have put the 
Ventura County horse ranch that they bought in February on the market, and she 
has re-listed her Bel-Air mansion at $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
They're asking $3.95 million for the 20-acre ranch, which Gabor named Silver 
Fox Farm for her favorite horse. The ranch has a 48-stall barn, corrals, a 
six-horse electric walker, lighted show ring, an eight-unit apartment building 
and a ranch house. Gabor bought it for $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
She also re-listed the Bel-Air house that she's had on and off the market with 
a couple of realty firms since 1988, starting at $6.95 million. A month after 
she first listed it, she raised it to $10 million, and less than six months 
later, she upped it again to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The French Regency, said to have once been a residence of Elvis Presley and -- 
at another time -- of Howard Hughes, is on an acre and has gardens, a swimming 
pool, city views, two master suites, a ballroom and a room from the set of the 
1952 film "Moulin Rouge," in which Gabor and Jose Ferrer starred. 
</P>
<P>
Both properties are listed with Ruth Hoffman at Mike Silverman &amp; 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Just in time for school, a Japanese family had found a house in Palos Verdes to 
buy for their daughter, bound for Santa Monica City College. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't typical of student housing. 
</P>
<P>
It is a six-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath oceanfront estate with 7,500 square feet of 
interior space, including a gym, sauna and maid's quarters. It also has 
gardens, koi ponds, orchid greenhouses, aviaries, a swimming pool, spa and sun 
deck. Asking price: $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The parents put the house in escrow, and then decided that her commute to 
classes would be too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like that, 2 1/2 weeks later, I got a call from their broker, saying, 
'Please give the deposit to the sellers and don't consummate the deal," said 
listing broker Larry Arman of RE/MAX Rolling Hills Realty. The deposit amounted 
to $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
As for the sellers, Arman said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny thing, but in today's marketplace, they would have preferred 
selling the house (to collecting the deposit), but I tell other people about 
it, and they say, 'Get me the same deal."' 
</P>
<P>
A Chatsworth home described by its listing agent as a former retreat for 
LUCILLE BALL and DESI ARNAZ has come on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"RKO built it for them in 1950," said Bobbie Epstein, who has the $898,000 
listing with Coldwell Banker, West Sherman Oaks. A few years later, the famous 
couple bought the studio and the house, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-square-foot house, which was recently refurbished, has two main 
bedrooms, two maid's or sitting rooms and a living/family room area large 
enough to accommodate a couple of hundred people, she said. The house sits on 
three-fourths of an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Zipp, an international retailer of computer and electronics parts, has 
owned the house for about eight years. "He's moving to Santa Barbara," Epstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
JULES BERMAN, the Beverly Hills man who brought Kahlua to America and helped 
develop Huntington Harbour and Lake Arrowhead, has sold a 10,000-acre ranch in 
the northeast corner of California for $2.75 million, according to Richard L. 
(Dick) Burns, of Rolling Hills Estates, who handled the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Jules bought the ranch in the early '70s with his partner, Bob Prescott, for 
raising game birds; hunting and fishing," Burns said. "They had plans to 
develop it, but then Mr. Prescott died." 
</P>
<P>
Prescott headed a group of investors who founded Flying Tiger air-freight line, 
which was purchased by Federal Express in 1988. When the ranch was sold, 
Federal Express had an interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
Burns described buyers of the ranch as "San Francisco business people and 
investors from Japan, who plan to develop the property into some sort of 
recreational activity."

ABOUT REAL ESTATE: SECOND MORTGAGE AS HOME-SELLING TOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We must sell our house, and this slow real estate market is killing 
us. We have agreed with the buyer that we will take back a second deed of trust 
for five years. Can you advise us how we can best protect our money? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: More and more, sellers are turning to creative financing to make a deal 
in today's real estate market. One of the methods is for the seller to take 
back a second deed of trust. 
</P>
<P>
A second-trust (mortgage) can be a very effective tool to assist you in 
marketing your house. Whether your buyer is assuming your existing loan or 
obtaining a new loan, your willingness to take back financing for a period of 
time may make the difference in the cash needed by the buyer to meet your 
selling needs. 
</P>
<P>
If the interest rate that you offer is significantly attractive, this may tip 
the balance in favor of your making the sale. 
</P>
<P>
It is important, however, that the second trust be properly prepared. Each 
state has different rules, and you must check with your attorney about such 
matters as usury laws, recording details and other requirements that state law 
may impose on a second trust. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the note signed by your borrower might have to state that "it is 
not negotiable." This means that you may not be able to sell (discount) the 
note to a third party, but will have to wait until the full time expires to get 
paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
To protect yourself, you will have to investigate the credit worthiness of your 
buyer. Find out what income your buyer makes and obtain the buyer's permission 
to do a credit search with a local credit bureau. 
</P>
<P>
If the credit bureau reports a history of slow or delinquent payments to such 
places as local department stores or oil companies, you may want to think about 
extending further credit to an already overextended purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
You also want to make sure that there will be more than adequate security in 
the property in the event of a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you are selling your house for $200,000 and your buyer obtains 
an 80% loan for $160,000, you are taking a serious risk if you lend the 
borrower the difference between his loan and the purchase price, namely 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
If your buyer defaults on the first trust loan, and that lender forecloses, you 
may very well end up being wiped out because there is little or no equity left 
in the property. Thus, there should be some restriction on the amount of the 
first trust that is being loaned, before your second-trust financing. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the ideal situation is to sell the property and take back a first 
trust. For those of us who own our house free and clear of any mortgage, or if 
we have but a small mortgage that can be paid off out of the sales proceeds, 
you are always better off taking back a first trust rather than a second. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in today's market conditions, a first trust is probably a better 
investment than putting the money directly into a bank. 
</P>
<P>
Oversimplified, when you lend money, your buyer will have to sign two pieces of 
paper. One is a promissory note, whereby the buyer states that he or she has 
borrowed a certain sum of money, and agrees to repay that money,, with 
interest, in monthly or quarterly payments. 
</P>
<P>
You have to figure out whether you want the payments amortized equally over a 
period of years, or whether the buyer will be permitted to pay interest only, 
until the entire balance of the note becomes due. 
</P>
<P>
This promissory note must reflect provisions for default, so that you will be 
able to call the note in the event the purchaser misses a payment or two. You 
have to take a tough stance in connection with your buyer. 
</P>
<P>
If a payment is missed, and you are lenient, you may end up having to foreclose 
because your buyer will be too far behind in payments to ever catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, to secure the note, the buyer will sign a deed of trust. This 
deed of trust (the mortgage paper) when recorded among the land records in the 
jurisdiction where your house is located, puts a cloud on the title to the 
property, so that if your buyer is unable to make the payments on the note, you 
will have an opportunity to foreclose on the property. 
</P>
<P>
You are putting the world on notice that you have an interest in the real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
You have to select trustees whom you respect and trust. You have the right to 
select any person of your choosing, and it can be a relative, friend, business 
acquaintance or your attorney. 
</P>
<P>
It is advisable to have at least two trustees, and you also must have absolute 
discretion to substitute trustees. When your buyer signs the deed of trust, in 
effect the buyer is deeding the property in trust to your trustees. 
</P>
<P>
They hold title to the property, and will either foreclose on the property in 
the event of a default, or will release the trust when the promissory note is 
paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
The deed of trust is a very important legal document. It must be prepared 
carefully, and it must reflect the true legal description of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The original note, signed by the borrower, must be given to you at closing. Do 
not rely on the title attorney or title or escrow company to keep that note in 
the files. It is a very valuable piece of paper, which you should keep in a 
safe place. 
</P>
<P>
The deed of trust will be recorded in the office of land records where your 
property is located. Make sure that your name and address are written clearly 
on the original deed of trust so that the record's office will be able to mail 
it back to you after recordation. 
</P>
<P>
There are many important provisions that should go into your second deed of 
trust if you decide to go this route: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A "cross-default provision." You want language in your deed of trust that, 
in the event the borrower is in default on the terms of their first trust, this 
will automatically trigger a default on your note also. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The promissory note and deed of trust should contain a very tightly drawn 
due-on-sale clause. You may be prepared to lend this particular buyer money to 
purchase your house, but you do not necessarily want that loan to be assumed by 
a third purchaser down the road. The general rule of law is that in the absence 
of a specific non-assumption clause in your note and deed of trust, that note 
and deed of trust are freely assumable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A provision should be included in the note and deed of trust requiring the 
borrower to maintain adequate homeowners insurance coverage, naming you (the 
lender) as beneficiary in the event of a fire or other destruction of the 
property. Additionally, the buyer should present evidence to you at least once 
a year that the real estate taxes and insurance policies have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, make sure that someone visits the property periodically. If the 
property is run-down, its value may be diminishing, thereby impairing your 
security. If significant repairs are evidence, you may want to insist that your 
borrower take care of these matters promptly. Most standard deeds of trust 
specifically require that the borrower maintain the property in decent 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Second deeds of trust are very valuable tools for a seller, especially in slow 
market conditions. But a poorly drafted legal instrument is of no use to 
anyone.

SOME 'CURES' FOR 'HOME SICK' SUFFERERS 
</P>

A key phrase operates in your tale of the Powells with "a combined income of 
about $75,000" and down payment savings of about $85,000: ". . . they just 
don't like most of what they see." In other words, for such people it is not 
can't but won't. 
</P>
<P>
Between can't and won't lies the compromise wisely sought by Rezowalli and Dean 
who "wanted to live on the Westside" but settled for a house in Whittier. 
That's the sum and substance for those who really want an affordable home. 
</P>
<P>
I still want a home on the Westside myself. But I found advantages in a view, 
privacy and seclusion where I settled near Highland Park that I never could 
have dreamed of on the Westside. I don't think it's rationalization when I say 
those factors have been found to be more important to my changing concepts of 
quality of life for the long run.

SOME 'CURES' FOR 'HOME SICK' SUFFERERS

We sympathize with the present generation on their predicament on the housing 
situation. This family has several couples with the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
However, we of The Older Generation, also had our "Classic Stress Syndrome" in 
the '30s, '40s and '50s: very few jobs, coming out of the Depression into a war 
where our lives and plans were put on hold for a long, long time, and if 
youmade a salary of $90 per month, you were "King of the Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we did get a wonderful break from Uncle Sam -- G.I. loans at 4% -- if you 
qualified. This was a pay-back for putting your life on the line for your 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, and we certainly count our blessings every day of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
So, please give The Older Generation a little TLC.

I grew up quite happily in a rented bungalow in a blue-collar neighborhood in 
Los Angeles. I have for the most part lived in rented apartments since then. 
</P>
<P>
I have never felt deprived nor depressed. My two children are not depressed, 
and for that matter, none of my friends, including those who grew up in and 
raised or are raising their children in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
This is a classic California problem and I have a classic solution. If these 
people live to own a home then they should move to a state where they can do 
just that. Or better still, they can look at those who are not renters, but are 
homeless, many of whom once owned houses but lost them and still "keep on 
keeping on." Life is transitory at best, and these people should try to find 
something more permanent in their lives than chasing illusions of happiness.

Those wanna-be homeowners should look again at less populous/less popular areas 
such as the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Quality of life here is excellent. Housing is more affordable and freeway 
traffic is lighter. 
</P>
<P>
They might drive here, look around and be pleasantly surprised. My husband and 
I are glad that we did!

THE ADVANTAGES OF LOCKING IN A RATE; 
</P>
<P>
HOME LOANS: WITH THE MARKET SO VOLATILE, IT PAYS TO HAVE A LENDER GIVE YOU A 
'RATE LOCK' FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mortgage market is more volatile today than it has been in months or even 
years. Troubles in the Middle East, wild swings in the price of oil and the 
specter of a recession are just a few of the factors that are making interest 
rates gyrate and would-be borrowers sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Since no one can say where interest rates will be next week -- much less 30 or 
60 days from now -- it's a good idea to seek a "rate lock" if you're looking to 
buy a home today or refinance one that you already own. 
</P>
<P>
A rate lock is basically a promise by a lender to give you a loan at a 
specified rate and on certain other terms within a specified period of time. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a lender offered you a 30-day rate lock on a 10 1/4% loan with 
two up-front points, you would be guaranteed those terms for 30 days, even if 
rates skyrocketed in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"A rate lock protects you if rates go up between the time you apply for the 
loan and the time the loan is actually funded," said Tom Criser, a mortgage 
broker and president of the Lender's Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, rate locks aren't as easy to understand as you might think. 
Since policies regarding locks vary from one lender to the next, you'll need to 
ask your loan representative lots of questions to make sure you understand 
exactly what you have been promised. 
</P>
<P>
Some lenders automatically lock in your rate for 30, 60 or even 90 days from 
the moment they receive your completed loan application. Others lock it in for 
only 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still others won't lock it in at all: You get whatever rate they're offering 
when the loan is actually approved. 
</P>
<P>
And some lenders charge you for the privilege of locking in a rate, while 
others don't. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't charge you for a 60-day rate lock on an FHA or VA loan, or a 45-day 
rate lock for a conventional mortgage," said Ralph Mozilo, executive vice 
president of mortgage banking giant Countrywide Funding Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you want a rate lock longer than that, we'll negotiate a fee with you." 
</P>
<P>
The reason why most lenders charge borrowers for longer-term rate locks is 
simple: By and large, lenders don't have any better idea of where rates will be 
several months from now than their customers do. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a loan and want to lock in your interest rate, here are 
some key questions to ask of your loan representative: 
</P>
<P>
* How long will my rate lock last? Again, it could be from as few as 20 days to 
more than 90. If you've been offered extremely good loan terms but the rate 
lock will last only 20 days, you'll want to hurry up and fill out the loan 
application before the lender's offered rate expires. 
</P>
<P>
* When does the rate lock take effect? Ideally, the promised rate will be good 
beginning the day you first talk to the lender. But usually, you won't be 
offered a firm lock until you have turned in your completed loan-application 
package. That's one more reason why you should move quickly to fill out all the 
paper work if the lender is offering an unusually good loan. 
</P>
<P>
* Will the rate lock cost me anything? It's important to realize that the best 
rate locks aren't always free. For example, if one lender offers to lock in a 
10 1/4% rate for free but another offers to lock in a 9 3/4% rate for a $300 
charge, give serious consideration to paying the fee and taking the 9 3/4% 
rate. The savings you enjoy over the life of the loan may offset the money you 
pay up-front. 
</P>
<P>
* What charges will I incur if my loan isn't approved or I choose to cancel my 
loan application? Some lenders will refund most or all of the money you have 
paid for processing fees and the like if your loan application isn't approved. 
But if you voluntarily withdraw your loan application at the last minute, 
you'll still probably be billed for the credit report, appraisal and other 
costs that the lender has already incurred.

CARRY NOTE YOURSELF ON A HARD-TO-SELL HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell, a retired Times staff writer, now is a 
Phoenix-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I were young and naive, and we bought a new mobile 
home in 1982. The home had all the things we wanted and what we thought would 
help the mobile home sell when we were ready to move up to a house. We paid 10% 
down and financed the rest with a typical 15-year mobile-home loan. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, we put the mobile home on the market. Today it is still for 
sale. The problem is that we now have children and have outgrown it. Also, our 
income has almost tripled. 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that we walk away from the home but we are afraid of what 
it would do to our credit rating. We have also considered renting it out, but 
are concerned about it being maintained. Also, it is located in a park and the 
management frowns upon renters. 
</P>
<P>
We currently owe about $14,000 on the mobile home. We have that amount in 
savings and gross about $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: When you bought the mobile home it fit your life pattern at the time. 
Disregard the advice of friends that you simply walk away from it. You 
obviously have an excellent credit rating and this could put big dents in it 
for many years to come. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you knuckle down in your selling efforts -- offer to carry the 
entire note yourself after the payment of a modest (perhaps $500) down payment 
at an interest rate that is no higher than the current market -- perhaps lower. 
</P>
<P>
Remember your own situation as it was eight years ago. There simply have to be 
other young couples in exactly the same boat today, and the only trick is in 
finding them. 
</P>
<P>
I'd enlist the services of a good real estate broker with experience in mobile 
homes for openers, and emphasize to him or her your new flexibility in 
financing. There may be interested buyers at military installations in your 
area. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you go ahead and find your dream house while conditions are good 
and worry about the mobile home later. I really doubt that the park management 
could effectively block your renting the place if it got down to the 
nitty-gritty, anyway, but a buyer would be much better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borderline Case to Refinance Adjustable 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage (30 years) at a current rate of 
12%. Our renewal is due soon. Every year our mortgage keeps on increasing -- it 
never went down from the 9.24% in 1987. Is it worthwhile to refinance to a 
fixed rate now and beat the renewal? We plan, however, to stay in our house for 
three more years. What is your outlook for a decreasing interest rate for the 
fixed rate this year? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know what interest rates are going to do, but I suspect that rates 
will either remain flat or slip down slightly. You are a borderline candidate 
for refinancing. Normally, if you can refinance down 2% and are planning to 
stay in the house at least two years, it pays. I'd say yes to it. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a bargain? You borrow X number of dollars to buy a house and the 
lender, over the life of the mortgage, collects three times as much from you as 
you borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
This is the lender's definition of "bargain." If you feel differently, you can 
sharply reduce the interest paid and cut years off the life of the mortgage 
through painless acceleration. Our leaflet, "Free and Clear: Getting the 
Mortgage Monkey Off Your Back," explains how. Send a long, stamped, 
self-addressed envelope and $2 to cover costs to Don Campbell, P.O. Box 80260, 
Phoenix, Ariz. 85060.

DESIGN SOLUTIONS: WHEN SHOULD DESIGNER JOIN HOME PLANNING?

QUESTION: We are going to build a new home and have begun working with an 
architect on plans. At what point should we begin to consult with an interior 
designer? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A designer should be called in at the same time as the architect. They 
should work closely together to achieve a well-functioning home for your 
lifestyle, and one that is aesthetically pleasing to you. This will be the best 
money you can spend and can save you thousands in costly mistakes and possible 
redos later. 
</P>
<P>
The qualified designer will be concerned with the actual function of the space 
for your lifestyle. The practical placement of furniture and the wall space 
required for that furniture. The designer helps see, enhance and translate your 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The designer understands traffic patterns, spatial relationships, scale and 
proportion, and color and texture, and what will be best suited to the period 
and style of your residence.

Strong Combinations When Painting House 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are planning to paint the exterior of our home and do not want it to be 
bland or ordinary. On the other hand, we won't want it to stick out like a sore 
thumb. Can you suggest some combinations of colors to achieve a distinct 
appearance? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most people play it too safe when painting the exterior or their homes. A 
rich new color is an easy way to add distinction to a nondescript house. 
</P>
<P>
I've tried certain strong combinations that work wonderfully well on houses. 
I've found that painting the bulk of a building a strong/dark color and 
trimming out the woodwork, the overhang, window frames, shutters and roof trim 
in a very light color, with a darker accent color for the window sashes and 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Do not paint natural, unpainted materials on the exterior of the house, such as 
weathered brick, wood shingles or stone unless they look ugly.

Mixing 'Clubby' With Southwest Interiors 
</P>
<P>
Q: I like the Southwest style, but my husband prefers a "clubby look." You can 
imagine how difficult it is for us to agree when buying furniture. What 
combination can you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
A: First of all, we need to determine what the "clubby look" is. Perhaps old 
English, dark paneling, overstuffed furniture? This could be blended with 
Southwest only if both sides will concede to some compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Take the usual dark paneling and lighten to a natural or whitewash finish. If 
paint is the only wall element, a faux leather finish may be used. Add wood or 
slate floors and major upholstery pieces, such as big overstuffed sofas and 
chairs. Choose Indian blankets or poncho-style fabrics in darker, traditional 
colors. In accessories, again, the key is compromise. Some from each style can 
make you both happy. Don't forget, scale and color are important elements to 
consider when mixing styles.

PLANTING IN NATIVE SOIL MAY BE BEST BET; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: SOME EXPERTS FEEL THAT ORGANIC AMENDMENTS MAY BE HARMFUL WHEN 
THEY LOWER THE SOIL'S WATER-RETENTION CAPABILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning a water-wise garden, may begin with how you prepare the soil. 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing body of evidence that adding organic amendments to the soil 
may not contribute anything and may, indeed, be a bad idea -- at least in some 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Said a leading proponent of xeriscape -- Randall Ismay of Landscape and Water 
Management Consultants in Los Angeles and Laguna Niguel: "We recommend planting 
in 100% native soil." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is trying this idea on some sites, planting in what they call an 
"unprepared hole." 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest thinking, not only do organic amendments not help, they 
may hurt, because they diminish the soil's ability to store water -- by 
lowering its water-retention qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Even in poor or rocky soils, proponents of "no amendments" prefer picking 
plants suited to the soil and the site. "Change what you plant, not the soil," 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
The organic amendments we are talking about are things like processed wood 
shavings or sawdust. They are not fertilizers, but are designed to make a soil 
more manageable by physically separating the soil particles. 
</P>
<P>
Research carried out in the Midwest suggests that planting in unamended soil 
also makes for healthier plants that are less likely to topple years later -- 
plants that grow stronger, longer. 
</P>
<P>
In many soils, amending the soil that goes back in the planting hole produces 
an unacceptable interface between native soil and amended soil. This interface 
turns back roots, so they tend to circle and not move out into the surrounding 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
If the surrounding soil is a heavy clay or other relatively impermeable soil, 
the planting hole filled with amended soil might also become a "bathtub," as 
one soil scientist calls it. Water will collect in the planting hole, killing 
the plant by suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
This new thinking does not mean that there is no use for organic amendments, 
but Ismay recommends that they be used as a mulch, "on top of the soil, not in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that they work better on the surface, where they can break down 
into the form most useful to plants and then slowly work their way down into 
the soil. A 3- to 4-inch layer is usually recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"No organic amendments" applies mostly to good, valley-bottom soils -- sandy 
loams and clay soils, even clay soils that "you could throw on a potter's wheel 
and fire," Ismay said. 
</P>
<P>
Clay soils are composed of very tiny particles that pack together. Water 
penetrates this mass slowly, but exits it just as slowly. It may take hours to 
get a clay soil wet, but it takes weeks for it to dry out. 
</P>
<P>
Getting clay wet is the trick, and amending a soil helps water soak in, but it 
also exits quickly. The secret here is to use drip irrigation or any of the 
other "low-flow" devices that put water on slowly so it can soak in. 
</P>
<P>
Clay is also naturally stubborn, unyielding and intractable, if a soil can be 
said to be so. This means that in flower beds and vegetable gardens, where one 
is constantly working in and with the soil, amendments are the heroes, making a 
clay soil manageable. 
</P>
<P>
"No amendments" applies mostly to trees and shrubs -- permanent plants with 
far-reaching roots. Some also think it wise for drought-resistant ground 
covers, and even lawns, but not flowers or vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Henry, turf and landscape adviser with the UC Cooperative Extension in 
Orange County, said "delicate plants such as vegetables and bedding plants that 
don't have a tough, vigorous root system can't penetrate a heavy soil. This is 
one case where organic amendments can help." 
</P>
<P>
"And in very rocky soils or very sandy soils, there may be times when organic 
amendments are called for because the soils can be very porous." 
</P>
<P>
But even in these cases the amendments are used not to hold onto water so much 
as they are used to hold onto nutrients -- fertilizers you add to the soil, 
which otherwise might wash right on through. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make a general statement and cover all the bases," Henry said, "but 
in most instances, on level land that has not been bulldozed out of the side of 
a hill, it is not necessary to add organic amendments, and may indeed be a bad 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
George W. Schmitz, soil scientist and former chairman of that department at Cal 
Poly Pomona, and now a consultant with Donald Eberhard &amp; Associates of 
Fullerton, consulting agronomists, said in hillside soils we are "obligated to 
amend because these are not soil." 
</P>
<P>
Cut from the sides of hills, or brought in as fill from some other construction 
sites, he likes to call these "formations" because they have little or no 
qualification as soil, but may be solid rock, loose rock or very sticky clay 
subsoils. And they all need amending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitz recommends getting a soil test if you are not sure what kind of soil 
you have. "All sorts of interesting things might turn up," he says, such as 
very poor fertility, unusual minerals or high salt concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
"A soil test can explain all sorts of problems in gardens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg Supply Co. has soil text kits available at nurseries -- the Soil Test 
Box costs $29.95, or $32.95 for the version that also tests for salts in the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
You fill the box with soil and they have a soil lab run the tests. You get back 
figures and recommendations on what to do. Or call the County Cooperative 
Extension. If you are pretty sure you have an ordinary clay soil, even a heavy 
clay, or a nice loam, here are the new recommendations for plantings trees and 
shrubs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dig a shallow hole, only as deep as the nursery container or root ball, but 
make it three to four times as wide. 
</P>
<P>
Break up and pulverize the soil as you dig it out. No clods allowed. Set the 
plant in the hole and fill the hole with the pulverized native soil, tamping it 
down as you go. 
</P>
<P>
It helps if you thoroughly water the ground three to four days ahead of time. 
This makes digging a whole lot easier, and the damp clods will shatter when hit 
with the back of the shovel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use the extra soil to build a watering basin around the hole and put a 2- 
to 3-inch mulch of organic amendment inside the basin, keeping it away from the 
very base of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Water by flooding the basin or with drip emitters installed in each basin. The 
basin is necessary in clay soils to hold the water long enough for it to soak 
in. Sprinklers will not work on plantings that have not been amended because 
they apply the water too quickly and it cannot soak in. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Deets, an assistant transportation engineer with Caltrans, said this last 
trick -- the watering basin and mulch -- is a "winning combination." Very 
simple, it has nonetheless cut the mortality rate of new plantings 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
For ground covers (even lawns, say some), one would simply rototill the soil to 
loosen it so roots and water can penetrate easily while the grass or other 
plants becomes established. For flower gardens and vegetable patches, look on 
the back of the packages of soil amendments at nurseries to see how much to add 
to the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, you can add up to 50% by volume, though a 4-inch layer tilled into the 
top 12 inches of soil usually does the trick. 
</P>
<P>
One final note: Planting with no amendments does make for slower growth 
initially, and one must be careful not to overwater, but after a few years, 
plants in native soil will become larger and stronger than those in amended 
soil.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
 Continue feeding chrysanthemums every three weeks until their buds show color. 
</P>
<P>
Remove dried up, faded flowers and replant containers and flower beds with more 
annuals to continue the color show well into fall. 
</P>
<P>
Because warm weather continues well into fall, be sure to maintain a regular 
watering schedule with deep, thorough soakings.

BIG BUCKS DOMINATE THE BIG PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without a doubt, the primary impact of TV on the game of football can be 
measured in dollars. Billions of them. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, NBC and CBS collectively paid $2.7 billion to the NFL earlier this year in 
a bidding frenzy designed to keep most of the games away from cable.Throw in 
the $450 million that ESPN and TNT each paid for a limited number of contests 
and the total package for four years exceeds $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That breaks down to $32.8 million per team per year, nearly twice what each 
club received from the NFL's last TV deal three years ago. The owners, of 
course, pocket their fair share, but a good chunk finds its way into the 
wallets of the players. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana will make 
$4 million this season. And before playing a single down, rookies such as 
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Jeff George are set for life with 
multimillion-dollar deals. 
</P>
<P>
Such salaries stand in contrast to 1973, when Tom Jackson, all-pro linebacker 
with the Denver Broncos, earned $21,500 his first year. "By the time I made it 
to the $300,000 range (in the mid-80s)," he said, "I thought, 'My goodness, who 
would have thought this? I would have played for free."' 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, now an ESPN broadcaster, said he doesn't begrudge the players grabbing 
as much as they can get, but he's not sure the big bucks are good for the game. 
He contends that huge sums kill the incentive to excel and improve of younger 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure some of the athletes are willing to make the sacrifices of an 
older era," he said. "I want to see kids play the game for the love of the 
game. My fear is that players are becoming so obsessed with the money that the 
play becomes secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Summerall, the longtime CBS broadcaster, agreed that some older players who 
don't want to be banging heads any longer are making so much that they simply 
can't give it up. 
</P>
<P>
Other football experts dismiss such nostalgia for a purer athletic era. Former 
Kansas City Chiefs Coach Hank Stram believes that "when you screw on the hat 
and pump up the balls, no one is worried about the money." And Terry O'Neil, 
executive producer of NBC Sports, said, "Just look at the game. You can't 
believe the way these guys are throwing their bodies around in pursuit of 
victory. The total recklessness of it, the mania, the blood." 
</P>
<P>
But it's the three major networks that could end up bloodied and bowed. Before 
they signed contracts this year, the networks had thrived right alongside the 
NFL. But Robert C. Wright, chairman of NBC, recently said that at the current 
prices all three networks were likely to lose money on pro football. And he 
said he doubted NBC would bid on the NFL next time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't fault the league for this," O'Neil said. "We all signed the piece of 
paper. But the advertising marketplace is not what it was before. While some 
advertisers, the beer companies and certain car companies are willing to pay 
the increasing costs for football, it drains money out of other (programming). 
They say, 'Maybe I will pay this outrageous price for football, but I won't be 
able to support your comedy lineup on Thursday nights anymore."' 
</P>
<P>
And if NBC does carry out its threat to punt in four years, where will all 
those fanatics TV has created turn? 
</P>
<P>
Look at what happened to boxing, say many broadcasting insiders. 
Subscriber-supported cable and pay-per-view -- where the viewer, not the 
network, foots most of the bill -- soon could be the primary TV home of the 
NFL. STEVE WEINSTEIN

HELSINKI SUMMIT: THE KEY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf will lead the "new business" list at Sunday's 
one-day summit in Helsinki, but President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev have a long list of "old business" to discuss as well. The summit 
agenda includes: 
</P>
<P>
PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
<P>
*The Bush Administration has been delighted by Soviet cooperation in the 
anti-Iraq campaign. Early on, the Soviets condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, 
cut off the flow of weapons and spare parts to Baghdad and gave the green light 
to the U.S. military buildup in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
*Although some Soviet officials have voiced concerns about the growing military 
deployment, the Soviets have taken no steps to forestall it. That contrasts 
sharply with the past, when U.S. military moves in the Middle East caused the 
Soviets to put their troops on alert. 
</P>
<P>
*The key question: How much more does Bush want? U.S. officials say he will 
push Gorbachev to quickly withdraw from Iraq more than 100 Soviet military 
advisers whose presence has become a touchy issue. But officials differ in 
their assessments of how hard Bush will push that issue and how much he is 
willing to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET ECONOMY 
</P>
<P>
*Gorbachev is facing an economic "disaster" at home that is "only going to get 
worse," says one senior U.S. official. The Soviet leader has made clear that he 
wants economic aid from the West and needs it fast. 
</P>
<P>
*The Administration does not object to other countries providing aid. For 
domestic political reasons, however, it has been unwilling to move too quickly 
to commit itself to the effort. Now, because of the Soviet role in the Gulf, 
that reluctance may be melting. 
</P>
<P>
*One unresolved question: Will the Soviets pass a new law guaranteeing citizens 
the right to leave the country? If so, the Soviets would be eligible for "most 
favored nation" trading status with the United States, a major symbolic victory 
for Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
*Earlier this year, the MFN issue became tied to the controversy over 
independence for Lithuania, which has been seeking to leave the Soviet Union. 
At June's summit in Washington, Gorbachev tacitly promised that he would not 
push the MFN issue until the tensions over Lithuania had eased so Bush would 
not be forced to make a difficult choice. Those tensions now have eased, and a 
new push to eliminate trade barriers could be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
ARMS CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
*In November, the United States, the Soviet Union and virtually all the nations 
of Europe are scheduled to get together at a conference in Paris and sign a 
treaty limiting the size of European armies. 
</P>
<P>
*Unfortunately, the treaty is far from being finished. Both Bush and Gorbachev 
would like to see the treaty signing come off as scheduled. Among other things, 
the conference is supposed to endorse the new status of a unified Germany, and 
the Soviets would like to see an international agreement in place that ratifies 
German promises to respect international boundaries and limit its own armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
*To finish the treaty on time, Bush and Gorbachev plan to try to iron out 
remaining issues involving the number of military airplanes each side can have, 
particularly which planes to count and how to count them. Lower-level officials 
on both sides have been deadlocked on the issue, and it needs "a push from the 
two leaders," says White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
CAMBODIA AND AFGHANISTAN 
</P>
<P>
*Last month, the United States, the Soviets, China, Britain and France agreed 
on a peace proposal to end the 11-year civil war in Cambodia. The warring 
factions in that country have responded positively, but one faction -- the 
Cambodian government headed by Hun Sen and backed by Vietnam -- has hedged its 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
*Because the Soviets are the main power backing Vietnam and Hun Sen, Bush hopes 
to convince Gorbachev to push the Cambodians harder. 
</P>
<P>
*Afghanistan presents another stalemated civil war. For years, the Soviets have 
backed a communist regime in Kabul, while the United States has supported an 
anti-communist resistance movement in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
*For a while, U.S. officials hoped that the Kabul regime would simply collapse 
once the Soviets pulled their troops out of the country. But that has not 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
*Now both superpowers would like to see a cease-fire, plus an agreement by all 
sides for elections that would be supervised by an interim government other 
than the current regime. But Najibullah, who heads the Kabul government, has 
been unwilling to step aside and let an interim government take over. 
</P>
<P>
*Najibullah recently visited Moscow, and Bush would like to sound Gorbachev out 
on whether the Afghan leader showed any greater flexibility, aides say.

PITCHER PERFECT; 
</P>
<P>
25 YEARS AGO TONIGHT, KOUFAX MOWED DOWN ALL 27 CUBS TO MAKE HIS FOURTH 
NO-HITTER EVEN MORE SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three times in his sensational career has Sandy Koufax walked out to the mound 
to pitch a fateful ninth, where he turned in a no-hitter. But tonight, 
September the ninth, nineteen hundred and sixty-five, he made the toughest walk 
of his career, I'm sure, because through eight innings, he has pitched a 
perfect game. He has struck out 11, he has retired 24 consecutive batters and 
the first man he will look at is catcher Chris Krug. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vin Scully 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago tonight, Glenn Beckert of the Chicago Cubs struck out in 
his first at-bat against Dodger pitcher Sandy Koufax, but only after his 
screaming liner down the left-field line had landed a few inches foul. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the visitors' dugout at Dodger Stadium, the rookie second baseman 
was stopped by teammate Ron Santo, who gestured toward Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
"What's he got tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
Answered Beckert: "Nothing. He ain't got nothing. We should be able to get to 
him tonight." 
</P>
<P>
A seer, Beckert was not. 
</P>
<P>
Koufax, described by a Times reporter as "a Michelangelo among pitchers," had 
taken hammer to chisel and carved out the beginnings of his masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
When his work was complete, he had retired 27 consecutive batters -- 14 by 
strikeout -- pitching a perfect game and beating the Cubs, 1-0, in perhaps the 
most dominant performance of his Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think the last two or three innings, that's as well as I ever 
pitched," Koufax said recently. "Earlier in the game, I didn't have great 
stuff. I was just getting people out. But the last two innings were probably as 
good as I ever pitched." 
</P>
<P>
The stylish left-hander struck out eight of the last 10 batters, including the 
last six. Only Beckert and Byron Browne, who lined out to center fielder Willie 
Davis in the second inning, hit the ball solidly. 
</P>
<P>
It was the "most memorable moment" in Los Angeles Dodger history, according to 
a poll of fans conducted by the Dodgers during the 1975 season. 
</P>
<P>
The game was noteworthy not only because of Koufax's dominance, but also 
because Cub pitcher Bob Hendley almost equaled the feat of his more celebrated 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
Hendley pitched a one-hitter, giving up only a bloop double by Lou Johnson in 
the seventh inning that did not figure in the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hendley, a left-hander whose 48-52 record in seven major league seasons 
included six shutouts: "That was the most recognizable thing I ever did in 
baseball, and I came out a loser." 
</P>
<P>
Hendley and the Cubs were in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . And Koufax ready and delivers. Curveball for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh-and-one the count to Chris Krug. Out on deck to pinch-hit is one of the men 
we mentioned earlier as a possible, Joey Amalfitano. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the strike-1 pitch to Krug: Fastball, swung on and missed. Strike 2. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can almost taste the pressure now. Koufax lifted his cap, ran his 
fingers through his black hair, then pulled the cap back down, fussing at the 
bill. Krug must feel it, too, as he backs out, heaves a sigh, took off his 
helmet, put it back on and steps back up to the plate. Tracewski is over to his 
right to fill up the middle. Kennedy is deep to guard the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike-2 pitch on the way: Fastball, outside. Ball 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Krug started to go after it and held up. And Torborg held the ball high in the 
air, trying to convince Vargo, but Eddie said, 'No, sir.' One-and-two the count 
to Chris Krug. It is 9:41 p.m. on September the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-2 pitch on the way: Curveball, tapped foul off to the left of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers defensively in this spine-tingling moment: Sandy Koufax and Jeff 
Torborg; the boys who will try and stop anything hit their way -- Wes Parker, 
Dick Tracewski, Maury Wills and John Kennedy; the outfield of Lou Johnson, 
Willie Davis and Ron Fairly. And there's 29,000 people in the ballpark and a 
million butterflies -- 29,139 paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Koufax into his windup and the 1-2 pitch: Fastball, fouled back, out of play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dodger dugout, Al Ferrara gets up and walks down near the runway. And 
it begins to get tough to be a teammate and sit in the dugout and have to 
watch. Sandy back of the rubber, now toes it; all the boys in the bullpen 
straining to get a better look as they look through the wire fence in left 
field. One and two the count to Chris Krug. 
</P>
<P>
 Koufax, feet together, now to his windup, and the 1-2 pitch: Fastball, 
outside. Ball 2. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people in the ballpark now are starting to see the pitches with their 
heart. The pitch was outside; Torborg tried to pull it over the plate. But 
Vargo, an experienced umpire, wouldn't go for it. Two-and-two the count to 
Chris Krug. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy, reading signs, into his windup, 2-2 pitch: Fastball, got him swinging. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
A rookie catcher from Riverside, Chris Krug had hoped to redeem himself as he 
batted in the ninth. His throwing error had allowed the Dodgers to score in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In a rally typical of the light-hitting Dodgers of that era, they scored 
without benefit of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Leading off the inning, Johnson drew Hendley's only walk. Sacrificed to second 
by Ron Fairly, Johnson then stole third and kept on running when Krug's throw 
sailed into left field. 
</P>
<P>
"I never should have thrown it," Krug said. "Lou had it beat. I threw the ball 
and Ron (Santo) had to jump for it and Lou knocked his feet out from under 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, though, said that Krug wasn't to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good throw," he said. "Santo didn't get there. I surprised everybody. 
That's the name of the game in stealing -- surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hendley: "Don't blame (Krug). He didn't put him on. I put him on." 
</P>
<P>
Hendley paid for it, too, gaining recognition not for his one-hitter, but as a 
footnote to a night of perfection by Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nobody who was going to hit Sandy Koufax that day," Santo said. "He 
just kept throwing fastballs right by you. It was just one of those games where 
you were just overmatched." 
</P>
<P>
Joey Amalfitano, a Cub reserve, was in the clubhouse when the game started. 
Walking down the tunnel to the dugout in the first inning, he heard the pop of 
catcher Jeff Torborg's mitt as Torborg caught Koufax's pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the dugout, Amalfitano said to Santo: "Man, it looks like he's 
throwing pretty good -- or at least it sounds like it." 
</P>
<P>
Torborg, though, said that Koufax struggled to gain command. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy didn't have his exceptional stuff early in that game," Torborg said. "He 
didn't have a good breaking ball early, but about the sixth or seventh inning . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"One of the at-bats I remember most was Ron Santo (in the eighth). The count 
got to 2-and-0 and (Koufax) promptly threw him three straight curveballs and he 
didn't offer at any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Santo took a place on the bench, strikeout victim No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"He got it together in the sixth or seventh and he really started to let it 
fly," said Torborg, who later caught a no-hitter by Bill Singer and the first 
of Nolan Ryan's record six no-hitters. "It was like Nolan. When (Koufax) got to 
the fifth or sixth, he sniffed it. You could see it in his eye." 
</P>
<P>
Koufax, too, said that he had labored a bit early in the game, but added: "I 
had real good stuff -- great stuff -- the last couple of innings." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hendley: "Particularly in the last few innings, you knew that he knew he 
had the perfect game and, as well as he was throwing and setting people down, 
there was very little chance of overcoming it. In the latter part of the game, 
he was awesome. And I knew that it was going to be very difficult, if not 
impossible, to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
After striking out as a pinch-hitter for the second out in the ninth inning, 
Amalfitano said to the on-deck batter, Harvey Kuenn: "You'd better be ready 
because he's getting it up there real good." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Kuenn, who had watched his overmatched teammate strike out on three 
pitches: "Wait for me, Joe. I'll be right back." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Sandy Koufax has struck out 12. He is two outs away from a perfect game. 
Here is Joe Amalfitano to pinch-hit for Don Kessinger. Amalfitano is from 
Southern California. From San Pedro. He was an original bonus boy with the 
Giants. Joey's been around and, as we mentioned earlier, he has helped to beat 
the Dodgers twice. And on deck is Harvey Kuenn. Kennedy is tight to the bag at 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastball: A strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh-and-one, with one out in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 One to nothing, Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy reading, into his windup and the strike-1 pitch: Curveball, tapped foul. 
Oh-and-two. 
</P>
<P>
 And Amalfitano walks away and shakes himself a little bit. And swings the bat. 
And Koufax, with a new ball, takes a hitch at his belt and walks behind the 
mound. I would think that the mound at Dodger Stadium right now is the 
loneliest place in the world. Sandy, fussing, looks in to get his sign. 
Oh-and-two to Amalfitano. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike-2 pitch to Joe: Fastball, swung on and missed. Strike 3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Koufax had always been a hard thrower, but he struggled with his control in the 
first six of his 12 major league seasons and threatened to quit after the 1960 
season, when his overall record was 36-40. 
</P>
<P>
But he reconsidered -- "I got the empty feeling I would be leaving a job 
undone," he said in 1961 -- and packed Hall of Fame credentials into his last 
six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that in his last five seasons, when he was 111-34 with an 
earned-run average of 1.95, Koufax was the greatest pitcher in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"I matured a little as a person," Koufax once said of his dramatic improvement. 
"I stopped pressing after I learned that if you fail, life will still go on. I 
changed mechanically and learned to pitch. I learned to control myself. Instead 
of trying to do something 100%, I left a little, (giving) maybe 95 to 99%." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1961 and 1966, Koufax led the National League in victories and shutouts 
three times each, complete games twice and strikeouts four times. His 382 
strikeouts in 1965 set a major league record later broken by Ryan. In each of 
his last five seasons, he led the National League in ERA, fashioning a 
career-best of 1.73 in his last season, 1966, when he was 27-9. 
</P>
<P>
He led the Dodgers to pennants in 1963, 1965 and 1966, winning the Cy Young 
Award each year. His 25-5 record and 1.88 ERA in 1963 also earned him the 
most-valuable-player award. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a fastball that was considered second to none, Koufax threw "the best 
curveball I've ever seen," Torborg said. "I had to climb up closer to the 
hitters than I was used to because his breaking ball broke straight down and 
you almost had to reach up underneath (to catch it)." 
</P>
<P>
Said Krug, who played in only 79 major league games but nevertheless faced 
several Hall of Fame pitchers: "Frankly, he had the best fastball in the 
league, the best curveball and the best change. And he could get them all over 
most any time he wanted. So, he just overmatched you. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I faced him, I took the first pitch and it was high. 
But I said, 'Holy cow!' I'd faced (Bob) Gibson at that time. And (Don) 
Drysdale. And (Juan) Marichal. (Jim) Maloney from Cincinnati. There were some 
guys in the league at that time who could really bring it. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was a cut above." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't start out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Brooklyn to Jack and Evelyn Braun -- he became Sandy Koufax after his 
mother married Irving Koufax, a lawyer, when Sandy was 9 -- Koufax preferred 
basketball to baseball as a youth. A high school gym teacher, Larry Merchant, 
urged him to play football, but Koufax wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
And when Merchant, who went on to become a columnist for the New York Post and 
is now a boxing analyst for HBO, later kidded Koufax about his reluctance to 
play football, Koufax told him: "Aw, Larry, you know that basketball was my big 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Cincinnati, Koufax earned a basketball scholarship with a 
good showing as a freshman, then tried out for the baseball team only because 
the coach had arranged a spring-vacation trip to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Koufax pitched only 31 innings in four games for Cincinnati, but showed enough 
promise in a summer league that year that the Dodgers, on the advice of scout 
Al Campanis, offered him a bonus of $14,000. The rules of the time forced the 
Dodgers to keep Koufax, 19, on their major league roster for two years because 
they had given him a bonus of more than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few major leaguers who never played in the minors, Koufax was used 
sparingly during three seasons in Brooklyn and was 27-30 in his first three 
seasons in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He showed occasional flashes of brilliance, equaling a major league record by 
striking out 18 Giants in a game in 1959 and losing a 1-0 game to the Chicago 
White Sox in the 1959 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until 1961, when he was 18-13 and broke a 58-year-old National 
League record by striking out 269, that Koufax emerged as a dominant pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on July 1, 1962, when he gave up no hits in a 5-0 victory over the New 
York Mets, Koufax pitched no-hitters in four consecutive seasons, capping his 
run on his perfect night against the Cubs in the Dodgers' drive to the 1965 
World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1966 season, Koufax and Drysdale staged one of the most celebrated 
salary holdouts in baseball history. Bargaining together, the two, who combined 
for 49 victories in 1965, at first asked for $1 million, $500,000 each, for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
They also hired an agent, unheard of at the time, and threatened to quit if 
their demands weren't met. They signed to star in a movie, "Warning Shot," 
opposite David Janssen, and actually reported to the studio to begin work on 
the film as the holdout dragged on for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after missing spring training, they signed for only one season, Koufax 
for $125,000 and Drysdale for $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Koufax responded with one of his best seasons, but about a month after the 
Dodgers had been swept in four games by the Baltimore Orioles in the World 
Series, he announced his retirement. His arthritic left elbow, he said, pained 
him too much to continue pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of years to live after baseball," Koufax said in making his 
announcement. "And I would like to live them with the complete use of my body." 
</P>
<P>
He was 30. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, he signed a 10-year contract with NBC as a commentator, but his 
inward personality was ill-suited for the job and he quit after six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hell of a job," Koufax once said, "but if you go to the ballpark 
every day hoping it's going to rain, it's obvious you're in the wrong line of 
work." 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a minor league pitching instructor for the Dodgers for 11 years 
before resigning last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Still fiercely private, Koufax, 54, now lives in Vero Beach, Fla., with his 
second wife, Kim. 
</P>
<P>
"He jogs a lot in the morning and plays a lot of golf," said a neighbor, Dodger 
pitching coach and former teammate Ron Perranoski. "He kind of likes to be 
alone. He and his wife don't like to be bothered." 
</P>
<P>
Told by a reporter at an old-timers' game at Dodger Stadium last July that The 
Times planned to publish a story to coincide with the 25th anniversary of his 
perfect game, Koufax said: "Go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
He reluctantly answered a few questions, but made it clear that he is still 
uncomfortable talking about himself and his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . He is one out away from the promised land and Harvey Kuenn is coming up. 
So Harvey Kuenn is batting for Bob Hendley. The time on the scoreboard is 9:44. 
The date: September the ninth, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy into his windup and the pitch: A fastball for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 He has struck out, by the way, five consecutive batters. And that's gone 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy ready and the strike-1 pitch: Very high. 
</P>
<P>
 And he lost his hat. He really forced that one. That's only the second time 
tonight where I have had the feeling that Sandy threw instead of pitched, 
trying to get that little extra. And that time, he tried so hard, his hat fell 
off. He took an extremely long stride to the plate and Torborg had to go up to 
get it. One-and-one to Harvey Kuenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's ready. Fastball, high. Ball 2. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't blame a man for pushing just a little bit now. Sandy backs off, mops 
his forehead, runs his left index finger along his forehead, dries if off on 
his left pant leg. All the while, Kuenn just waiting. Now Sandy looks in. 
</P>
<P>
 Into his windup and the 2-1 pitch to Kuenn: Swung on and missed. Strike 2.

 It is 9:46 p.m. Two-and-two to Harvey Kuenn. One strike away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy into his windup. Here's the pitch: Swung on and missed. A perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
On the scoreboard in right field, it is 9:46 p.m. in the City of the Angels, 
Los Angeles, California. And a crowd of 29,139 just sitting in to see the only 
pitcher in baseball history to hurl four no-hit, no-run games. He has done it 
four straight years. And now he capped it. On his fourth no-hitter, he made it 
a perfect game. And Sandy Koufax, whose name will always remind you of 
strikeouts, did it with a flourish. He struck out the last six batters. So when 
he wrote his name in capital letters in the record books, that K stands out 
even more than the O-U-F-A-X.

STREEP PLAYS HER LATEST ROLE FOR LAUGHS. BUT OFF SCREEN, SHE'S ASKING HOLLYWOOD 
SOME RUDE QUESTIONS.

WAIT A minute, say that again. 
</P>
<P>
A woman of a certain age? Not you Meryl, Hollywood's Young Dame, with the face 
that launched more than a dozen films and all those Oscar nominations -- how 
many of them were there? Can it be that the country's most acclaimed actress, a 
woman in consummate control of her career, is heading into middle age 
complaining? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I am 40 and in this business, and that's a cautionary tale," says 
Streep, rendering a mild knuckle-rapping in her Upper East Side New York hotel 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that Streep has spent months playing a character immersed in the 
indignities Hollywood heaps on her in the about-to-open "Postcards From the 
Edge." Based on Carrie Fisher's quasi-autobiographical novel about women 
working in movie-industry hell plus or minus a drug habit, the film stars 
Streep as a post-ingenue, post-Percodan-plying actress with an asp-like (and 
Fisher-like) sense of outrage. To wit: "Actors are not treated well, and 
actresses are treated . . ." well, like a common four-letter word. 
</P>
<P>
"It is horrible to admit, but I loved trotting out all those insecurities about 
being a woman in the movies," says Streep with a wicked smile. "And I loved 
being able to say them." 
</P>
<P>
Streep brought a similar wit and outrage to her keynote speech at the Screen 
Actors Guild's first women's conference held last month in Los Angeles. One of 
the highest-paid actresses in the business, she took Hollywood to task over its 
dirty little sexist secret. "We all know what the problem is," Streep declared. 
"There's very little work for women. And when we do work, we get paid much less 
than our male counterparts. . . . And what work there is lately is odd." This 
year's movies? From them one might assume, added Streep, that "the chief 
occupation of women on Earth was hooking. And I don't mean rugs." 
</P>
<P>
You mean "Pretty Woman"? 
</P>
<P>
"Right!" she says, still passionate weeks later. "And I am upset that 
15-year-old girls want to go see that four and five times. I know it's the 
Cinderella thing, but it disturbs me. There are a lot of women screenwriters 
and a lot of women in development, but I guess because those women want to make 
it past the glass ceiling, maybe they think they have to say, 'Do "Die Hard 
II." Now let me be vice president.' " 
</P>
<P>
Streep has been fortunate enough, and now is powerful enough, to fashion a film 
career far outside the "Die Hard"/"Pretty Woman" mold, and her resume has a 
breadth and sweep of unusual dimension. Her many heroines, while not strictly 
feminists, compose an extraordinary gallery of strong-minded women who are 
difficult, independent, ambitious -- morally ambiguous women out of step with, 
yet defined by, their times: the discontented wife in "Kramer vs. Kramer," a 
political idealist in "Plenty," a literary adventurer in "Out of Africa," the 
femme fatale in "The French Lieutenant's Woman," a Holocaust survivor in 
"Sophie's Choice," a betrayed wife in "Heartburn," a whistle-blower in 
"Silkwood," a derelict in "Ironweed," a murder suspect in "A Cry in the Dark," 
among others. All of them were captured by Streep with chameleon-like accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes "Postcards." There is an expectant buzz about the film. It is 
Fisher's first screenplay, a part-fact, part-fiction Hollywood insider story 
that some say is director Mike Nichols' best work since "Carnal Knowledge." And 
for Streep, "Postcards," like that SAG speech, is something of a personal 
breakthrough. After 15 years and 17 films, in which she's mastered the art of 
playing the wild-eyed tragic heroine -- most often from another country or 
century -- the reclusive, honeyed actress with the icy image and all those 
Oscars is letting her hair down to play a modern woman who is, as she says, 
"closest to me, the way I really look, the way I really sound." 
</P>
<P>
As she heads into her fourth decade, Meryl Streep is acquiring newly assertive 
roles on screen and off. In her films, she has stepped away from playing 
starchy, period heroines to star in a series of contemporary comedies. And in 
her private life, the actress, who has been active in environmental issues -- 
even testifying before Congress -- is stirring up discord in her own workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"My passion in the whole question -- well, obviously I am very well compensated 
for what I do -- but where I felt starved was as a member of an audience, as 
someone with daughters and a son. Where are their role models like the ones I 
had when I grew up?" asks Streep in her hotel suite. "Carole Lombard, Katharine 
Hepburn, Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Lucille Ball -- those big, 
formidable presences who were important people in their films. The women in 
recent movies increasingly occupy less important places. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this theory that in the '30s it was titillating and fun to imagine 
Hepburn as Woman of the Year with a male secretary. But now, when 43% of 
business-school graduates and 46% of law-school graduates are women, it's not a 
fantasy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
And what about money? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm not like Jack (Nicholson) with $11 million up front," says Streep, who 
is said to command less than half that sum. "I don't feel greedy, but when Rick 
Moranis makes what Michelle Pfeiffer makes, when he's as big a draw, supposedly 
-- who knows what anybody makes because nobody talks about it, but it is all 
the way down the line until you hit scale -- women make 40 to 60 cents on the 
male dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Streep pauses. "Now, really, that's all I have to say. I'm not a spokesman. Now 
I want my brothers in the union to speak up on my behalf. As well as my 
sisters. I want to hear somebody support us." 
</P>
<P>
The sound you hear, however, is largely that of voices behind closed doors. SAG 
staffers say that they've had "a lot of positive reaction from the industry" 
since Streep's speech and that "a number of memos from producers have been 
written reactivating projects that had (major) roles for women in them." What 
that means is that not much is changing. Yet. Says one powerful Hollywood agent 
who insisted on anonymity: "Bottom line, until there is a huge box-office hit 
with a huge female star as the lead -- and there are only (a few) actresses in 
the country that currently have that kind of clout -- nothing will change." 
</P>
<P>
Streep is on that short list of actresses carrying a measure of box-office 
power -- along with Sigourney Weaver, Cher, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler and 
Michelle Pfeiffer. Which explains why she's sitting still for the press to talk 
about "Postcards" -- a story about a sexist business told from a woman's point 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this movie," says Streep, on the rebound after a salary dispute with 
Carolco torpedoed her longtime ambition to play Eva Peron in the on-again, 
off-again film version of "Evita." "I want people who don't go to movies to 
come out and see this. Before I made my speech, I made an informal survey -- 
people in broadcasting, publishing. You'd be shocked at the number of people in 
the film industry who don't go to movies. They don't go. What I tried to 
emphasize was that there is an ignored audience and that by going after the 16- 
to 25-year-old males, maybe they've contributed to the shrinking of the general 
audience. 'Postcards' was not conceived as a blockbuster. It wasn't pre-sold to 
the Southeast Asian market. But I think it has some real smart talk in it, and 
if it does well, it will be great for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody presumably includes women -- be they actresses, screenwriters or 
audience members. Not that Fisher's novel was a feminist tract, but the movie, 
starring Streep and Shirley MacLaine, adapted by Fisher from her book, is one 
of the first adult films released this fall after a summer dominated by Dick 
Tracy-Total Recall-Die Harder-RoboCop II fare. Fisher: "It's a story about 
powerful women and no powerful men." Nichols: "Do I think it is a feminist 
film? I think it has feminist elements in it. One of the themes is women as 
meat." Oh, yeah, says Streep, "it has this other thing -- the relationship 
between mothers and daughters and how that affects who you are and what you 
become." 
</P>
<P>
BUT LET'S BACK up. It's mid-August in New York, one of those hazy, 
end-of-summer days when the avenues are empty, "sale" signs plaster the 
boutique windows in the East 60s, and everyone with any sense and a decent 
portfolio is in the Hamptons. But Streep, who lives in the far northwest corner 
of Connecticut with her husband, sculptor Donald Gummer, and their three young 
children, is on L.A. time. She's just back from the SAG conference, the film's 
in manic post-production, and next week is the press junket to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
She opens the door to her hotel suite herself, and there is that famous face, 
milky pale with those translucent blue eyes that are at once far away and 
really, unexpectedly, intense. Not that it's a hostile or even aggressive look. 
It's more like the gaze of an unself-conscious child who is transfixed by the 
sudden stranger in the room. 
</P>
<P>
She offers coffee from a silver pot on the table next to a porcelain bowl full 
of dried rose petals. "Or can I get you something else?" she asks, pouring, the 
perfect hostess. She is wearing a salmon-colored silk blazer, a white 
silk-and-lace blouse, navy blue culottes, navy stockings and Italian leather 
flats. Armani schoolgirl with a touch of Ralph Lauren. Her hair, too, is 
tailored, cut short, streaked blonde and sort of shooting straight up off that 
high, creamy forehead. With the coffeepot in hand she looks like a nice, rich 
lady from Connecticut in town to see friends. 
</P>
<P>
Except she has that face, that famous face, as faceted as a gem you want to 
turn in your hands, letting the light catch the planes, all questions of its 
beauty superfluous. "Too many bones, I think," says Streep with a slightly 
self-conscious laugh. She is on the sofa now, letting her initial concentration 
on her guest grow into something like a passion for interaction. Her eyes are 
still intense, but the atmosphere is warmer, more engaged now. 
</P>
<P>
She is renowned for being an entertaining, if infrequent, interview subject -- 
jumping in and out of accents, rolling her eyes, making jokes. And her voice -- 
now loud, even boisterous, now a hushed flutter -- is used to exceptional 
effect. No wonder cinematographers love to photograph her; she never looks or 
sounds the same way twice. 
</P>
<P>
She has talked about performing -- as opposed to simply acting -- as being "the 
final gloss, what attracts the audience to your character." In a conversation, 
she subtly demonstrates that connection by spinning a web of complicity; over 
the course of two hours, she leans forward, her back seldom touching the sofa 
cushions. She makes you feel that you have become part of the performance, that 
she is reacting to you. "It's like one shimmering step beyond behavior," says 
Streep. "It's that extra thing that makes it glitter a little bit." "Look, 53% 
of the population is women," says Streep, reiterating her SAG conference theme. 
"There are that many stories, that many lives to be explored. (But) there are 
three prestige pictures a year, which means that three actresses get big parts. 
That's it. People look at the roles as a retrospective of you, like you choose 
the canvas, but that's simply not true," she says impatiently. "It has more to 
do with what people felt was financeable, the accident of what roles are around 
in a given year." 
</P>
<P>
Which is how the country's preeminent tragic actress came to play a drugged-out 
smart mouth in a comedy. By all accounts, it was Nichols' idea to cast Streep 
as Susan Vale, a woman "who gets in her own way," as the director wryly puts 
it. Certainly Streep's work as the coquette in Susan Seidelman's campy 
"She-Devil" was amusingly different, if not exactly thigh-slapping. But even in 
Streep's more serious roles, Nichols, who directed "Heartburn" and "Silkwood," 
looked at her and saw her comic side. "She was very funny in 'Sophie's Choice,' 
but people didn't necessarily see it because it was a tragedy," Nichols says. 
"But when Meryl decides to be funny, no one is funnier." 
</P>
<P>
So, he sent her "Postcards." "It was the winter and in the middle of some 
snowy, horrible, endless night, and I was reading this script and I was 
laughing so hard and I was so excited that they wanted me to play it. I never 
really get offered parts like that. I was happy. I was really happy," says 
Streep with a really happy smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always a clown," she adds. "I didn't play a serious role until I got to 
drama school." In fact, "this is my favorite sound in the whole world": She 
screws up her face to make an enormous snickering noise. "That sound coming 
from behind the cameras. I love to make the crew laugh," she says, launching 
into the first of her many imitations, this one of a reprimanding assistant 
director, "I'm sorry, we can't use that take. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Filming "Postcards" provided unusual outlets for Streep's comic skills. For one 
thing, the movie is more overtly funny -- and more overtly dramatized -- than 
Fisher's novel, in which most of the narrative was a sardonic internal 
monologue voiced in a drug-rehab clinic. As Fisher has said, "there was no 
plot" to her book. In fact, she initially sent the book to Nichols with the 
intention of turning it into a performance piece rather than a screenplay. But 
Nichols insisted there was a movie in there somewhere. So Fisher wrote a draft, 
Nichols made suggestions, and before long there was a story about an alcoholic 
Hollywood mother (MacLaine) and her drug-addicted actress daughter (Streep). 
</P>
<P>
"When I read the book, I thought: Here is somebody who has endless resources to 
survive," says the actress. "She is relentless about her demons but is equally 
relentless about her humor. She serves her jokes like dessert for her own 
amusement, and it makes everybody else feel good, too." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher says she is concerned that the film's autobiographical aspect "will be 
perceived as my life with my mother (actress Debbie Reynolds) -- and some of it 
is -- but really it is a hearty mix of truth and invention." Nichols, however, 
maintains that the subject is "perfect for comedy, particularly one that goes 
after this problem of women in Hollywood." It is also, essentially, a story 
about a mother and daughter in which all the male roles -- husbands, 
boyfriends, agents, producers -- are secondary. 
</P>
<P>
And for Streep, this is the first time she's portraying a daughter on screen. 
"That was a great exercise for me," she says with deliberate understatement. 
Actually, Nichols says, playing a character so close to her self was "a new 
risk, because Meryl always looks inside herself for her characters. She 
rearranges her soul for them. The best actors are always a little dangerous, 
and Meryl has a lot of secrets. In this film, her secret weapon is that she 
sings." 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite in the league with "Garbo Talks," but Streep singing -- a 
raucous scene with a country band that brings down the house at the end of the 
film -- is something out of the ordinary for the actress who can cry in 15 
foreign accents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was hard. There was no hard part of the movie." Streep pauses and 
looks straight up at the ceiling. "Am I lying? Let me think. There was one hard 
part when we shot the end song. We did it once and they didn't like the 
shimmering curtain at the back. Now, I don't have the highest confidence in my 
performing skills in that area, and I thought I had aced this and gotten away 
with murder, and I said, 'Well, can you use the track so I can lip synch to 
that? I'll never be able to sing again.' And they took the shimmering curtain 
away, we reshot it and I did it," Streep pauses, ". . . a little bit better. 
And we drank a lot of champagne, and I did a little impromptu concert for the 
extras, and the word came back from the lab that we had to shoot it again." 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Nichols is lucky he is alive," she adds with a laugh, "but it gave me a 
lot of confidence, especially when the whole thing with 'Evita' fell out from 
under me. That was a big disappointment. So I was glad I got to sing in this. 
That's the apotheosis of the movie for me." 
</P>
<P>
So was this film, in which Streep plays a daughter who sings in front of her 
songstress mother, more difficult than, say, "Sophie's Choice," where she 
played a mother in a concentration camp? The actress lowers her head a moment. 
"That," she says slowly raising her eyes, "ventures into the realm of none of 
your business. That's where some of it comes from dealing with my own mother." 
</P>
<P>
WE DON'T know much about her mother. What we do know is that Streep is the 
oldest child -- and only daughter -- of Harry and Mary Streep, then of Summit, 
N. J., now residing near Mystic, Conn. As a child, Mary Louise Streep (the name 
Meryl was her mother's concoction) was not considered pretty. A somewhat bossy 
older sister to younger brothers Harry and Dana Streep was a brown-haired 
little girl with glasses and a tendency to direct her siblings in home movies. 
It was during high school that Streep first demonstrated an unusual ability to 
physically transform herself. She threw away her glasses, had her braces 
removed and became blond. As a result, she swiftly added to her resume 
cheerleader, swimming champion and homecoming queen. Meryl Streep, at the age 
of 15, had decided to become beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"For about 20 minutes I did (feel beautiful)," says Streep with a cautious 
laugh. Beauty, whether she likes it or not, is a perennial subject with the 
actress, who once described her looks as similar to those of the English poet, 
Edith Sitwell. The question continuously raised in reviews and other articles 
is whether her looks should be considered classically beautiful or arrestingly 
plain. In the past, she has dismissed such talk with ironic one-liners -- "I 
have a serious face; that's why I went into film." 
</P>
<P>
Today, this mother of three (Henry, 12; Mary Willa, 7, and Grace, 4),who still 
regularly works out in a pool, is exasperated. "Thank God I feel loved," she 
says. "Because the things that people write about you. . . . It's one of the 
reasons I liked 'She-Devil.' I wanted to do something to send up this 
preposterous sexual posturing." 
</P>
<P>
"And I think about this with my girls," she adds, referring to her two 
daughters. "They're so pretty and sweet looking, and that's the first thing 
that people say to them -- 'They're so beautiful!' And I don't want them to 
think about that. What's that Yeat's poem, 'A Prayer for My Daughter,' 'being 
made beautiful overmuch.' A lot of people who thought of themselves that way 
have to prove themselves on some other level. And in the movies, there is no 
substitute for beauty; there just isn't. For men and women. People will never 
stop talking about Paul Newman's eyes. It's revelatory." 
</P>
<P>
Does she think she is beautiful in film? There is something of a sigh. "I 
always think I look better in the movies than I do in real life because they 
spend so much time lighting actors. But then people say to me, the ones that 
are brave enough to come up to me on the street, 'Oh, you're so much prettier 
than in your movies.' And then I feel dreadful for two days because I think, 
God, that's the best I can look." 
</P>
<P>
But dig a little deeper, and beauty is revealed to be more than skin deep. "My 
mother was the pretty one in her family," says Streep after some prodding. "I 
wasn't." This confession is followed by a brief digression on the Streep family 
lineage -- "Spanish Jews who emigrated to Holland in the 15th Century and 
instead of signing their Jewish name, they simply drew a line. That's what 
'Streep' means in Dutch, 'line.' My mother's family is Swiss and English -- 
Quakers. I look like my grandmother and was raised a Presbyterian." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this breezy delineation, Streep's relationship to her mother appears to 
be pivotal -- in both her career choice and in her research for her current 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Says Fisher: "I would have rather avoided the subject in the film because the 
mother-daughter thing is always big and I do come from a powerful matriarchy, 
which is unusual, and Meryl has a powerful mother, too. If you are a woman who 
is intelligent, as Meryl is, then it is very easy to notice the discrepancy 
between yourself and your mother. This movie is about that -- powerful women 
and no powerful men and how that ends up, the way a lot of women do, by 
competing with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one of the film's more moving scenes involves a discussion between 
Streep and MacLaine that concludes with the line, "Mother, I couldn't compete 
with you, because somebody might win." It is a theme that Streep seems to have 
wrestled with in her own life. "My mother is amazing, really amazing," says the 
actress slowly. "She's one of the funniest people I know. She's witty, and 
she's not the kind of woman who thinks up things later. She comes up with the 
remark right at the moment," Streep adds. "She had that kind of quick wit. And 
I'm not, I'm not. . . . I'm shyer. And I always wanted to be like her. I'm sure 
it's one of the reasons I wanted to be a performer." 
</P>
<P>
That drive for performance first began to show up in elementary and high 
school, where Streep says she "got good marks, but I wasn't the smartest one. 
Mostly I was known for making trouble, making jokes, making animal noises and 
terrorizing the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
She attended Vassar, the all-women's college where her talent for acting -- and 
not just acting up -- began to surface. She took a first-year theater class. By 
her sophomore year, she had won the title role in Strindberg's "Miss Julie." "I 
became an actress because I was in a play at Vassar and I did really, really 
good, and my friends all swooned and said 'My God, how did you know how to do 
that?' And I didn't know how I did that, I just knew that I wanted it. I loved 
it," says Streep, rattling off what seems to be her stock answer to the 
why-she-became-an-actress question. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Yale drama school, where Streep caught the attention of The New York 
Times with her portrayal of Constance Garnett, a wheelchair-bound octogenarian 
in "The Idiot's Karamazov," a musical parody of Russian literature by fellow 
Yale colleagues Albert Innaurate and Christopher Durang. Other acclaimed 
performances -- as Helena in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," as the daughter in 
Strindberg's "The Father" -- soon followed. These Yale years were a somewhat 
stressful period for the precocious actress, who was repeatedly pulled out of 
class to perform at Yale's Repertory Theater -- in 40 roles for a dozen 
different directors. She developed an ulcer, and one of her acting teachers put 
her on probation because he thought she was holding back out of fear of 
overshadowing her fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in drama school, I was scared," she says. "It was the first time I 
realized this isn't something that is fun, that it had a dark side. Before 
that," she adds, "I just thought it was so much fun. I was playing ridiculous 
creatures, not human beings." Drama school, she adds, "was like boot camp, 
shaving your head. It made you humble. A lot of it was breaking your spirit, 
and out of your survival instinct you start gathering what's important." 
</P>
<P>
The first year after graduation, she performed in seven off-Broadway plays, 
after which she never attended an open audition or did television voice-overs 
or suffered any of the other indignities common to most budding actors. She 
spent a year or two playing in several Shakespearean productions at the New 
York Shakespeare Festival. Then she moved swiftly into film -- first a small 
part in "Julia," then "The Deer Hunter" and then "Kramer vs. Kramer," in which 
she co-starred with Dustin Hoffman, winning her first Academy Award at age 29. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Streep's acclaimed film performances, with their almost requisite 
Oscar nominations (out of eight nominations, she has won two, for "Kramer" and 
"Sophie's Choice"), have become almost routine. If critics have occasionally 
caviled that Streep is too perfect, too remote, an overly technical actor who 
can master the accents but never quite yields up the soul, few deny that she is 
that rare performer who has turned character acting into the stuff of leading 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
"Meryl brings to her film roles the kind of detail and delineation of character 
that we used to think was reserved for the stage," says Joseph Papp, producer 
of the New York Shakespeare Festival, who met her when she showed up for an 
audition just out of college. He's directed her TK times in plays such as 
"Measure for Measure" and the 1981 musical "Alice in Concert," for which she 
won an Obie award. Streep, he says, "has a tremendous capacity for being 
absorbed in a character, and she learned very fast how to play to the camera, 
taking her film acting beyond just being photographed." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, only a few of her films, including "Out of Africa," "Silkwood" 
and "Sophie's Choice," were commercially successful. Some of Streep's favorites 
-- most notably "A Cry in the Dark," in which she played the angry, 
unsentimental Australian Lindy Chamberlain, who was accused of murdering her 
own child -- were box-office failures. "That role took a piece of my soul," 
says Streep, who met the real Lindy Chamberlain during the filming in 
Australia. "Unlike most women, (Lindy) doesn't hide her fury. It's right out 
there. They didn't really distribute or advertise the movie, and I was 
extremely proud of it." " 
</P>
<P>
While appreciating anger in her subjects, Streep doesn't find it a useful 
emotion as an actress. "I've always rejected that 19th-Century idea that you 
have to anguish in a garret to create something worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about her own technique, Streep says, "It's highly associative work, 
the kind of mining of your emotions. I've never been in analysis, and I always 
feel like a completely blank page when I start, like I never know where I'm 
going to get (inspiration). I only know that something has called me -- like a 
vocation -- from the material. That there is something in there. I don't 
question or analyze why, I just know the parts of the script where my heart 
starts to race and the hair stands up on my arms. I don't have to do any more 
work until we shoot that day." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols says that "Meryl's magic starts before we start shooting," that she 
"tries out the character off-camera, and then she doesn't have to do anything 
when she's on camera." When she is on camera, adds Nichols, "it's all really 
true, it's really happening. The guy who plays her lover is in love with her, 
the guy who plays her enemy is a little afraid of her." During the shooting of 
one scene in "Postcards," co-star Gene Hackman, who plays Streep's director, 
"just stopped acting," Nichols says. "He was so caught up in watching Meryl 
that he just stopped. He apologized, and we had to shoot the scene again." 
</P>
<P>
Says Streep: "You have to be interested and mystified in the other person's 
feelings and be very, very curious about the person's heart. Not just the 
person you are portraying, but the person you're communicating with and the one 
that is unseen -- the audience. I always think that if I've made a connection 
with my character, and I've gotten into her heart, then they can get into 
yours. I always think about that invisible connection among us all, what we 
have in common as opposed to what divides us." 
</P>
<P>
Streep insists that despite her acclaim, she is just like every other actor. 
"It never stops, you keep thinking if I could just get something lined up for 
September." Last year was a particularly busy time. She shot "Postcards," then 
Albert Brooks' new film, "Defending Your Life," a courtroom comedy to be 
released this December or early next year that stars Brooks and Streep. They 
were back-to-back films that required for the first time that Streep and her 
family move to Los Angeles. "I bought a house in California because I have to 
work. I've made one movie living at home -- 'Ironweed,' because they shot it in 
Albany. They don't make a lot of movies in Albany. So we're struggling. We 
regard Connecticut as home, and we'll be there as long as we possibly can, but 
I don't know. The kids are getting older, they're in the hockey league, and 
they don't want to go to Australia or Africa. I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
As for any immediate return to the stage, the actress, who once said her career 
dream would be to form a troupe of roving actors, shakes her head. "I haven't 
done it in so long that I'm terrified to go back. But I got very proprietary 
when I saw Tracy (Ullman) doing my part (Kate in 'Taming of the Shrew') in 
Shakespeare in the Park. But no, I don't want to bring my kids (to New York). I 
want to put them to bed at night, which I can do if I make a movie." She says, 
almost offhandedly, that her one theatrical goal would be to play "Desdemona to 
Denzel Washington's Othello." But that, she says, is a way off, when the kids 
are older and she can get back to her Jane Fonda workout tapes. What she -- the 
actress who has so far been in complete control of her career -- is most 
concerned with now is maintaining that control, finding those roles that she, 
as, well, an actress in her 40s and beyond, can play. 
</P>
<P>
"Ageless," she shrieks with laughter when asked to characterize those roles. 
"Look, I didn't think of myself as a sexpot when I was 16, and it's never been 
the thing that I strutted in my work. I've never had a character who was 
motivated only by sex or lust. There was always some other need or insecurity 
driving the behavior. I feel that about people, that sex is one component of 
their being, just like intelligence or curiosity or laziness or anything else. 
And I'm always interested in bringing out a whole person rather than just one 
aspect. But the movies usually call for only one aspect in women -- because 
it's easiest for them to deal with that one aspect -- their sexuality. But 
unfortunately, we were born with brains, and it's hard to negotiate the present 
landscape with a brain and a female body. That's the only interesting thing to 
me now, men and women and how they relate."

GEORGE MICHAEL'S CASE AGAINST FAME; 
</P>
<P>
THE FORMER WHAM! STAR THOUGHT HE'D WALKED AWAY FROM TEEN ADULATION WITH HIS 
'FAITH' ALBUM, BUT HIS SEXY IMAGE BECAME A NIGHTMARE. NOW HE'S TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

<P>
What does George Michael have to complain about? 
</P>
<P>
Here's an Englishman who came out of nowhere in 1984 to -- wham! -- break into 
the U.S. Top 10 with a catchy, flyweight song, "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," 
making him a pop star at 21. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Michael made the almost unprecedented leap from pretty-boy 
teen dream to respected adult pop artist. His first solo album, "Faith," sold 
more than 14 million copies and won the Grammy for best album of the year. This 
time it wasn't just teenyboppers speaking. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
Michael says his pop dreams proved to be a personal nightmare, leaving him on 
the verge of an emotional breakdown during the early weeks of the 1988 "Faith" 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Back now with his second solo effort, "Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1," 
Michael is taking potentially revolutionary steps in hopes of reducing the 
strain of his celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign to downplay his exposure, he's not making any videos for the new 
album, and he's not planning an extensive tour. He may just do a half-dozen or 
so benefit concerts early next year, and even then he may concentrate on songs 
by other people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite simple, really," the singer said, sitting on the beachfront patio 
of his manager's Marina del Rey apartment. "I decided that the thing I really 
enjoy . . . the thing I really needed was my songwriting. I didn't need the 
celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
That sounds fine in theory, but complaints about pressures at the top are 
commonplace in pop music. Artists frequently argue that videos trivialize a 
song, and that touring for months at a time works against the creative process, 
not to mention maintaining a normal lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Doing something about these complaints, however, is rare because promotional 
videos and touring are considered essential elements in building 
multimillion-unit album sales. They are part of the price of fame. 
</P>
<P>
Videos, in fact, may be a more important sales tool these days than live shows. 
This is the age of the video star: Madonna, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul . . . 
and George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lightweight image left over from his days as a member of the duo 
Wham!, Michael has proved a sharp pop strategist who understood in the early 
'80s that good videos had become a key to success. His sexy image in the Wham! 
and "Faith" videos most certainly contributed to his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The question that Michael's decision poses over the coming months: Can a record 
maker compete on the charts in the '90s without videos and tours? If someone of 
Michael's commercial stature and video presence succeeds, other artists may 
also step away from the video grind. This could lead to a break in video's 
stranglehold on the pop marketplace, where the trend is toward signing artists 
for their video potential rather than their musical abilities. 
</P>
<P>
But even Columbia Records is hedging its bet. It has released, with Michael's 
permission, a video of the album's first single, "Praying for Time," that 
consists simply of the song's socially conscious lyrics printed against a black 
backdrop -- no images of Michael himself. 
</P>
<P>
Another question raised by Michael's pledge: his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
To a cynical pop world that has heard everyone from Frank Sinatra to David 
Bowie threaten to say goodby to the microphone, the latest vows of George 
Michael may seem like little more than a calculated publicity move. After all, 
he's obviously still doing interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Michael anticipated the question. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people are going to believe all this is just some sort of 
gimmick . . . just another way to stir interest," Michael said in what was the 
first of three U.S. newspaper interviews he had agreed to do -- with the Los 
Angeles Times, the New York Times and USA Today -- in connection with the 
release of the album on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
" 'But I'm also sure that most people find it hard to believe that stardom can 
make you miserable. After all, everybody wants to be a star. I certainly did, 
and I worked hard to get it. But I was miserable, and I don't want to feel that 
way again." 
</P>
<P>
George Michael may be praying for time in his personal life and in his new hit 
single, but he could also use something a little more down-to-earth: a good 
sunscreen lotion. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Michael, a man known in the '80s for a tan so perfect that some speculated 
he somehow dyed his skin, had a shiny sunburn on his nose and forehead as he 
sat down for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Michael smiled when asked about the skin-dye rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to just sit out in the sun all the time because I loved it, so I always 
did have a tan," he said, brushing self-consciously at his bright, glowing 
nose. "But now I get bored doing that. I start getting restless . . . and, 
besides, I'm starting to burn. That's something that never used to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The singer, who had picked up the burn while riding a bike around the 
neighborhood that morning, was dressed casually in a white T-shirt and shorts 
topped off by a Lakers cap. He nibbled at some vegetables and other snacks on a 
table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, who has what he describes as a "vacation/investment" house in Santa 
Barbara but lives chiefly in London, seemed unusually at ease for someone who 
says he doesn't enjoy interviews. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't act overly friendly or overly dramatic. More than anything, he seemed 
to be taking care of a final chore before going on vacation -- and that's what 
he may consider his break from video work and media exposure to be. 
</P>
<P>
The sunburn added a welcome human touch to a persona that has often come across 
as a touch calculated. 
</P>
<P>
But why the final round of goodby interviews? Why not just drop out of sight? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was important, not really for the people who have always doubted 
me, because they'll still doubt me," he said. "I did it for the people who have 
supported me. I think they are owed some sort of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"But it won't really be goodby to my way of thinking because they'll still have 
the most important part of me, which is the music. The rest -- the whole video 
image -- was just a creation . . . something I wanted in the beginning because 
of all the childish fantasies about (craving) love and attention. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, it all got much bigger than I ever imagined -- and much harder 
to control. Ultimately, I wasn't comfortable with that kind of visibility and 
power. Once I became more confident as a writer, I realized I didn't need all 
that other bolstering." 
</P>
<P>
Arrogant is a word that was often applied to the handsome young singer during 
his early days as the leader of Wham!, the English duo whose hits, besides 
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," included "Everything She Wants" and "I'm Your 
Man." 
</P>
<P>
And it's easy to understand why, when you see such quotes as this one from a 
1988 interview with the English pop magazine Q: 
</P>
<P>
"People have always thought my career has been incredibly calculated and 
premeditated but it runs along pretty well parallel lines with most people's 
careers. It's just that the decisions I have made personally have been much 
more . . . correct." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, everything the pop sensation did was indeed correct -- and 
blatantly calculated, a trait that makes some observers suspicious now about 
Michael's true intentions. Two other tags applied to Michael more recently 
seemed more appropriate: articulate and down-to-earth. 
</P>
<P>
The way he tells it, George Michael was born to be a pop star. It's as if 
nothing else really mattered during his childhood. Even the name was part of 
the pop creation. 
</P>
<P>
Michael didn't shy away from questions about his childhood in various London 
suburbs, but almost every answer involved music. "I wanted to be a pop star 
since I was about 7 years old," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in London on June 25, 1963, Michael is the 
son of a Greek father and an English mother. One of three children, Michael, 
whose father operated a restaurant, described his upbringing as middle-class 
and his childhood as "stable, happy." 
</P>
<P>
Young Georgios did well in high school, where he was especially fond of English 
and art. But his passion was music. He loved listening to records, especially 
Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Queen. He didn't just listen to them -- he 
dissected them. He was fascinated by song construction and how arrangements 
were pieced together. 
</P>
<P>
But Georgios didn't think about pursuing music until he met Andrew Ridgeley, a 
schoolmate who shared his love for music and his hunger for fame. 
</P>
<P>
They formed their first band, a ska-influenced outfit called the Executive, in 
the summer of 1979. The group played a few dates and recorded a two-song demo 
that they sent to record companies, but it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the pair continued to write songs together while working at various 
odd jobs. Excited by the energy of the British dance-club scene, they recorded 
another demo tape. This time the tape -- featuring such original tunes as 
"Careless Whisper" and "Wham! Rap" -- led to a record deal in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Unusually headstrong, George Michael -- as Panayiotou began calling himself 
around this time -- rejected attempts to turn the duo, called Wham!, into a 
traditional rock band that would follow the normal club circuit in England. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bare," an autobiography recently published in England, Michael explained 
his thinking at the time. "We were very aware of how the music business was 
changing, how you could suddenly reach more people with a video on MTV than 
with a 90-date tour of the States. We knew it was the future . . . that for the 
first time you didn't have to be a band." 
</P>
<P>
About those days, Michael recalled during the Marina del Rey interview, "I was 
shocked at how little most people seemed to know in the record business and how 
willing they were to listen to anyone who seemed to have a firm idea about what 
was needed." 
</P>
<P>
Michael most certainly had a firm idea -- and it worked. He made it from high 
school to the top of the British charts in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
America was next. 
</P>
<P>
At first, everything was wonderful in Wham! The success. The screaming fans. 
And Michael fueled the frenzy. He danced around the stage in tight shorts and 
flashed the brightest smile since David Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time of flamboyance in pop . . . the start of the video age. Such 
rivals as Duran Duran and Culture Club were equally flamboyant, but Michael and 
Wham! outdistanced them all in England, coming up with slick and generally 
disposable pop that also had an undeniable edge of craft. 
</P>
<P>
There were doubts about Wham! at every step in its U.S. assault. At first, 
record company sharpies in this country said that the group's teen appeal 
wouldn't translate well here. They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Wake Me Up . . ." and "Careless Whisper" both went to No. 1. Other insiders 
raised their eyebrows in 1985 when Wham! tried to sell out stadiums. Wrong 
again. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael, who emerged as the heartthrob and creative center of the 
group, knew he had to get away from the teen-ish Wham! image and sound if he 
were to have a long career. So, the inevitable breakup. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the things that people loved about Wham! was the sense of 
friendship we projected, and that friendship was genuine," Michael said. 
"Andrew brought a lightness, a fun to the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"But he knew that Wham! was a finite thing and that it was just a question of 
when. We agreed very early that we wouldn't let it burn out . . . that when it 
got to a certain height, we'd stop it, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
Several small moves helped establish Michael's solo credibility, including a 
well-received appearance on a Motown TV special, where he sang with his 
childhood idols Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson. Another was a hit duet, "I 
Knew You Were Waiting for Me," with Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Faith" was his biggest test. 
</P>
<P>
The album was designed to both hold on to the legion of Wham! fans, yet exhibit 
a new maturity of songwriting that would attract an older following. It 
succeeded remarkably well. 
</P>
<P>
Videos for songs like the sensual, aggressive "I Want Your Sex" and the catchy, 
rockabilly-tinged "Faith" were MTV smashes, while such numbers as the dark, 
disillusioned "Hand to Mouth" suggested a deeper dimension. 
</P>
<P>
If the album's success was liberating, the "Faith" tour proved a horror show -- 
and led to Michael's dramatic decision to step out of the normal pop 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The singer's mood darkened slightly as he recounted the "madness" of the early 
days of the 1988 "Faith" tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I can remember the exact moment that I decided I must change my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Naively, Michael had thought he would be able to leave the frenzy behind when 
he stepped out of Wham! 
</P>
<P>
"We (opened) the 'Faith' tour in Japan, which was fine because they are 
reasonably quiet, and they listened to the music. But then we went to 
Australia, and the roof came off the first place we came to. The screaming. I 
thought, 'God, it is happening all over again . . . I'm not going to have a 
chance to really sing,' " Michael recalled, reliving his displeasure at the 
clamor and the huge sites. "And I realized I had to do it for 10 months." 
</P>
<P>
"It was devastating," he said of the "Faith" tour experience. "I was hugely 
temperamental, and I had a major problem with my throat, which didn't help at 
all because people thought that was just part of my being temperamental, and it 
wasn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of things, including being on the road for that long. I'm 
someone who really needs a center. I was very close to what I could call a 
breakdown until I finally took a month off, because of (throat) surgery, and 
sorted it out. I made the decisions that I'm acting on." 
</P>
<P>
Why does the video star now hate videos? 
</P>
<P>
Two reasons. Chiefly, they violate Michael's sensibilities as a songwriter, but 
he also has grown uncomfortable in front of a camera. (He refused to have his 
photo taken for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
"Videos force you to think of (songs) in a certain way rather than being free 
to interpret them however you like," he said. "Some songs are very good video 
songs . . . 'I Want Your Sex' and 'Faith' . . . but very little in this album 
is right for video. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are trying to express things with metaphors and much more subtlety, 
that's when you are doing yourself a disservice by making a video. I don't want 
to say I won't do another video ever, but I won't do one for the foreseeable 
future. If my life goes the way I want it to, I would like to never step in 
front of a camera again." 
</P>
<P>
On that issue, Michael added, "I don't know. It's strange. At some point in 
your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a 
certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs 
you more and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns 
you off . . . and it does feel like it is taking something from you. I don't 
know how to explain it any more than that. It is like taking something you 
don't want to give." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the question of videos and interviews, photo sessions and tours, the 
real challenge facing George Michael at the start of the '90s is the depth of 
his artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Even with his fame and the "Faith" Grammy, there is still an anonymous quality 
to Michael's music up through "Faith." Much like Billy Joel, he has a sense of 
craft as a writer, but he has yet to establish an original or arresting vision 
that gives his music a distinctive, significant edge. 
</P>
<P>
Though he was an early bloomer as a pop star, he is getting something of a late 
start as a serious writer. By 27, Bob Dylan had already written "Highway 61 
Revisited," the Beatles had released "Rubber Soul," Bruce Springsteen had 
recorded "Born to Run" and U2 had delivered "The Joshua Tree." 
</P>
<P>
Michael appears to recognize that challenge. He said he hopes staying off the 
road will give him more time to work on his writing, and that he has begun to 
explore writers of such extraordinary vision as Dylan, Joni Mitchell and the 
Beatles. He also was planning to do an album of dance tunes for early next 
year, but now may continue to write in the more serious vein of "Listen Without 
Prejudice." He does exhibit more personal revelation in key songs on the new 
album (see adjoining review). 
</P>
<P>
One encouraging sign of independence is that Michael isn't going along with the 
flattering comparisons of his new single, "Praying for Time," with John 
Lennon's idealistic "Imagine." 
</P>
<P>
In pointing out that the socially conscious song has attracted the most radio 
airplay of any single since 1985's "We Are the World," USA Today described its 
tone as similar to that of "Imagine." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like 'Imagine' at all," Michael said. "It's much more negative. I'd 
like to say things are bound to get better, but I don't really believe it. The 
song is my own way of trying to justify people's actions and their selfishness, 
I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
Sample lyrics from "Praying for Time": 
</P>
<P>
 And it's hard to love, there's so much hate 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging on to hope 
</P>
<P>
 When there is no hope to speak of 
</P>
<P>
 And the wounded skies above 
</P>
<P>
 Say it's much too late 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe we should all be praying for time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Michael leaned back in his chair and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
The world, he said, seems like a "place where things are running out of time. 
Everything is getting more violent. You need more protection all the time and 
it has gotten so bad that people's general attitude is, 'What the hell? I think 
I am going to hold on to what I've got.' The key line for me is the one about 
it's hard to love, but there's so much to hate. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real copout in the whole thing is the line about praying for time. 
Maybe I'd think that if I had children . . . I'd want to reach for straws. But 
I don't think that will make the slightest difference. I'm very much 
fatalistic." 
</P>
<P>
Besides making more music, Michael hopes to use the extra time to grow on a 
personal level. Relationships, he said, have been a problem for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they really haven't been difficult in the last few years, because I just 
haven't had one," he said. "I have been pretty disastrous with relationships, 
and I have kind of decided I was going to give myself a rest from them for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
While Michael's goals about concentrating on music and personal growth rather 
than show-biz marketing sounds good, Michael is bound to feel anxious if album 
sales slip substantially. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a great danger in releasing the first single from an album without 
a video because the momentum from the last album will cause large numbers of 
fans to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
But the real test of an album's commercial strength normally comes three to six 
months after its release -- when videos for a second or third single are 
released to keep public interest high. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records, is thrilled about the strong initial 
radio response to "Praying for Time," the album's first single. But he's also 
clearly a bit anxious about the singer-songwriter's decision not to do 
promotional videos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll have a lot of disappointed fans because there is no video, but 
when they get to understand his point of view and hear the record, I don't 
think there will be any problem," he said, trying to put the most optimistic 
slant on the situation in a phone interview from his office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained that he wants to do more work, more songs, more albums rather 
than have his time diffused with touring and doing videos and things that 
really rub him the wrong way. And if doing those things are going to cause that 
kind of a reaction in an artist, then what's the point of doing them?"

Bob Merlis, vice president of publicity for rival Warner Bros. Records, called 
Michael's move a "noble experiment," but said he thinks the importance of video 
is so firmly established in the pop world that it is difficult to imagine 
anything dislodging it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see a flood of artists following Michael's lead even if his album 
matches the sales of 'Faith,' " Merlis said. "Besides, Michael is a special 
case. He's already a multi-platinum artist who has a following. It'd be 
different if he were starting out. More than a test of the importance of video, 
I think the move may be a test of loyalty of Michael's audience." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't Michael worried about sales? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everyone (at CBS) is terrified that all this is going to sabatoge the 
album," the singer said. "But I honestly feel I am in a very privileged 
position because I have the luxury of knowing that simply because of the size 
of the last album, this album will be heard . . . regardless of whether I make 
videos or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I also have enough faith in the songs to believe that if people hear the 
album, enough will like it. I don't necessarily believe it will sell 14 million 
copies. I'd be very surprised if it does, but I do believe it is a much better 
album, and I think that in itself will compensate for part of the lack of 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the gamble involved in his experiment, Michael added: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't lose because I know what the alternative is. I'm not stupid enough to 
think that I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure. I think 
that is the ultimate tragedy of fame. . . . People who are simply out of 
control, who are lost. I've seen so many of them, and I don't want to be 
another cliche."

JILL GIEGERICH BALANCES SUCCESS WITH THE USUAL ARTIST'S BURDENS: RECONCILING 
THE PAST AND MAKING SENSE OF THE PRESENT

Jill Giegerich has got it but she does not flaunt it. She is among the most 
gifted and applauded of a younger generation of Los Angeles artists that 
emerged from the California Institute of the Arts in the '70s and went on to 
make waves in the international mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
At 38, Giegerich is distinctly a hatched talent, but bits of eggshell cling to 
her as they do to such classmates as Lari Pittman and Mike Kelley. Despite an 
art world now spawning overnight success, it still takes some artists years to 
forge a solid aesthetic track record. Could a woman artist working in Los 
Angeles be at a disadvantage? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an avid feminist," she says, "but in my work I allow no social pressure. I 
am upset at the lack of women and people of color in a world that is supposed 
to be in the avant-garde of social change. The art world here is actually 
extremely conservative. With all Los Angeles' diversity, the art scene is still 
a white bastion." 
</P>
<P>
Professionally, Giegerich has little to complain about. She's been seen in 
eight solo and 10 group exhibitions since 1980, including one in Japan and the 
biennial of New York's Whitney Museum. Her work sells briskly with major pieces 
bringing up to $30,000. An admiring contemporary called her "the empress of 
L.A. art." She recently switched galleries, moving from Margo Leavin -- an 
established leading showcase -- to Fred Hoffman, a recently arrived leading 
showcase. 
</P>
<P>
The art world regards changing galleries as old Hollywood's equivalent of a 
star swapping studios -- a cause for deliciously vicious speculation and a 
barometer of one's career. But, where Lana would have told Hedda all about it, 
Giegerich is resolutely mum on the subject. It seems, however, unlikely that 
she would have moved were it not to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I confess I have this ongoing reel of tape in my head having to do with my 
career. I struggle against the feeling that no matter what happens it's never 
enough. In that mood I won't be happy until the whole world puts me on a 
pedestal and I'm given a parade at the end of which I ascend to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bottomless-pit thinking. My more mature side realizes I've worked hard 
and gotten there. I'm generally respected, get to show regularly and don't have 
to work another job." 
</P>
<P>
You would never suspect voracious ambition from looking at her, or success from 
looking at her studio. She is tall, leggy and given to jogging shoes, shorts 
and men's shirts. Seated, she relaxes and gestures loosely. A classic, 
clean-cut type with straight brown hair and thoughtful brown eyes, her speech 
combines soothing softness with a candor so easy she sounds like someone who 
has experienced psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a little of that," she confesses. "Every seven years or so I suffer 
some sort of breakdown and have to stop working. I'm just recovering from one 
now. My back just fell apart. You have to have faith that humans go through 
these difficult, painful things to arrive at a new order that will be better 
than the old order." 
</P>
<P>
Her studio is in an alley near Adams and Fairfax, an ethnically mixed 
neighborhood looking vaguely deserted on account of the wide boulevard. Her 
immaculate blue bike leans against chain-link gates that open to a cluttered 
work space about the size of a two-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
'I can't offer you coffee or anything," she informs a visitor. "There are no 
amenities here. It's just a studio." 
</P>
<P>
She does, however, sit on a folding metal chair, hospitably leaving a 
paint-encrusted, chrome-frame padded job to her company. 
</P>
<P>
A moment of awkward, first-encounter silence is filled by glancing around a 
workroom filling up with new pieces that look familiar -- part painting, part 
sculpture. All of it is in black, browns, whites and tans. 
</P>
<P>
"Color doesn't play a part in my work. To me, using it would be like putting on 
makeup. My work has never taken a left turn. It's really been the same since I 
was about 10. It's all one long circular thought process. In college when I 
thought about what you have to do to be an artist, about 'great works' and 
'bodies of work,' I'd make something absolutely dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them constructions. I'm interested in building materials like plywood, 
cork and industrial sandpaper. When you take them out of their usual context 
they take on a lot of air and float off and become anomalies. Sometimes I try 
to make materials function as something they really aren't -- like making 
printed wood-grain function as water." 
</P>
<P>
She seems to speak of a work leaning against the wall. A corner of a black box 
juts from swirling, liquefied wood-grain. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I can identify the catalyst for a piece. That black-box thing came 
from a dream. In it someone told me there was this box at the bottom of the sea 
that held something important having to do with who I am. I dove down and saw 
this remarkable box. It was alive and sparkling in the water. I had the dream 
almost two years ago, but I remembered the way it hinted at an inclusive 
existence and visual ecstasy and magic. I didn't open it, I just left it. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece may grow from specific ideas but I'm always willing to release them at 
any point. I don't look for any particular metaphor. I want my voice and the 
viewer's voice together to decide what the meaning of a piece may be." 
</P>
<P>
Another construction leans nearby. Its background looks like a hugely enlarged 
section of an antique architectural print. A big box in floor-strippers 
sandpaper juts off the surface. A brass candlestick rests on the top ledge. 
Somehow, the combination of romance, history and modernism evokes the purgatory 
scene in Jean Cocteau's classic film "Orpheus." Her work often evokes the same 
spirit as that of the classic Spanish Cubist, Juan Gris. 
</P>
<P>
"I think an artist has permission to plunder art history. 
</P>
<P>
I'm interested in things that are in a state of flux and tension. Cubism has 
this dopey, straightforward way of doing things. It influenced me greatly. I 
love to proceed in a flat-footed way because if you approach a work without any 
conclusion in mind it produces its own gestalt and leads to paradox and 
enigma." 
</P>
<P>
Giegerich was born in Chappaqua, N.Y., to a 42-year-old mother. The daughter 
was a late arrival with two grown brothers. The artist recalls Chappaqua as a 
commuter community that would tally closely with most people's fantasies of 
blissful Ivy League affluence and summer holidays in the Caribbean. But 
underneath, she says, "There was a lot of weird dysfunctional stuff -- adult 
alcoholism was rife. Somebody told me that Chappaqua once had the highest 
teen-age suicide rate in the country. People try to act normal but underneath 
we're pretty crazy." 
</P>
<P>
She describes her mother, Elizabeth, as a model of relaxed stability. Her 
father, Carl, was an advertising executive. (He would die in 1980 after what 
his daughter calls "a life of abuse," adding, "The official cause of death was 
pneumonia but he was an alcoholic who also had lung cancer and Parkinson's 
disease.") 
</P>
<P>
In school, Giegerich was known as "the kid who makes art." 
</P>
<P>
"I was dyslexic and a bit of a geek," she says pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
When Giegerich was 17, her parents separated and she moved to Connecticut with 
her mother, leaving the house she had lived in since birth. 
</P>
<P>
"My last year of high school was crazy. I'd never before been in a new social 
situation. I didn't know how to make a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling angry and uprooted, she rebelled -- but checked first. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my school counselor the minimum number of days of attendance required 
to graduate. It turned out to be very low, so I just stayed home reading and 
experimenting with drugs. They never got to be a problem. I knew I had a life 
ahead and didn't want to ruin my brain." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, after building up a grubstake as a waitress, she hitchhiked to San 
Francisco with her boyfriend. She took a job in what she remembers as a 
"horrendous San Francisco sweatshop that made leather clothes. They made me the 
assistant manager. I screwed up so badly I was fired. I took some classes at 
San Francisco City College but it was depressing." 
</P>
<P>
One day she spotted a psychedelic ad for an experimental school near Portland 
called Mount Angel College and had a premonition it was her kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been a Catholic school, so there were still these nuns around, but 
mostly it was 70 wild kids from the '60s going crazy. I met an artist named Tom 
Cassidy and we formed a conceptual art group, the Space Angels. We went wild. I 
felt like I had found a place." 
</P>
<P>
After a year of anarchy in the pristine forests of Oregon, she moved on to 
CalArts with some classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people went to CalArts looking for less structure. I was looking for 
more. At Mount Angel you could get academic credit for having breakfast. 
CalArts was an amazing experience." 
</P>
<P>
She did not study directly with John Baldessari, the artist-guru who put 
CalArts on the art map with his "post-studio" conceptual art. She prefered to 
dip into the minds of a variety of teachers from Judy Pfaff to Michael Asher 
and Vito Acconci. 
</P>
<P>
While still a student, she married one of her teachers, figurative artist John 
Mandel. They now have a 6-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
("John and I are each other's most important critic," she says. "It's a good 
working relationship." But, she admits "Abrasion and professional jealousy 
creep in. He's 11 years older, so he's put a lot of that stuff to rest. I'm 
competitive and territorial.") 
</P>
<P>
She thrived on what she describes as CalArts' "devil's advocate" aesthetic. She 
says teachers constantly challenged students' assumptions, forcing them to hone 
their ideas to a state of absolute self-assurance -- which she now appears to 
possess in large measure. 
</P>
<P>
"CalArts formed a distinct language, but you can't categorize a CalArts 'look.' 
It is supposed to be conceptual and cool, but I don't think my work is like 
that. I'm trying to get down to the animal nature of things." 
</P>
<P>
Specific academic critical theories such as semiotics and deconstruction, often 
used to define her sort of art, do not interest her. She doesn't read 
theoreticians such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida or Jean Baudrillard, nor 
can she name any artists who do. Giegerich's cultural pursuits and inspirations 
lie mainly outside the arena of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
"The art world is in a mess," she says. "But I'm not sure it ever wasn't. I'm 
disappointed that when I want to be uplifted, going to an art gallery is not an 
option." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she turns to film, books or music. She is haunted by the Werner Herzog 
film "Kaspar Hauser," which traces the life of a youth raised like an animal as 
he comes traumatically into normal society with its smug assumptions and 
Draconian demands. She is influenced by Feodor Dostoevsky, Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez and two British travel writers, Bruce Chatwin and Redmond O'Hanlon. 
</P>
<P>
"They put themselves into extraordinary extreme circumstances and then write of 
their ideas of humanity and what it is. Chatwin's last book was about the 
Australian aborigines and his idea that humankind went wrong when it settled 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Her mind and work pursue a theme of friction between elemental and civilized 
life. There are also questions of metamorphosis, sacrifice and faith. She likes 
Beethoven's late quartets, Arabic songs that inspire religious ecstasy and a 
recording of the last known castrato, a papal choirmaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my work to find better ways of expanding the vocabulary for 
investigating a chaotic world. I want to sensibly pull that chaos around me and 
make something enriching, to take a world that is ugly and transitory, cruel 
and sublime, and find a way to walk through it with moments of understanding 
and flashes of insight." 
</P>
<P>
She has been interested in Buddhist and Hindu mythologies and the idea of a 
path in life embodied in the concept of the Tao. Aside from having a father who 
was a lapsed Catholic, the Giegerich family was not religious. There is 
something both troubled and spiritual about her artistic philosophy, but she is 
still capable of such all-American homilies as, "Mom just always said that 
things would work out and that everything that happens is for the best."
