<P>
BUDGET: BUSH HAS INVITED THE NEGOTIATORS TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MORNING 
MEETING TODAY. THAT MAY BE A HINT OF A BREAKTHROUGH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic and Republican negotiators, struggling to overcome their 
long-standing budget differences, appeared to be moving closer Sunday to an 
agreement that would make a significant dent in the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"They are narrowing the gap," said one official close to the negotiations. 
"There's a long way to go and it could still all fall apart, but I see grounds 
for optimism." 
</P>
<P>
In a hint of a possible breakthrough, President Bush, who was scheduled to 
return here from Helsinki at about 9:45 p.m. EDT Sunday, has invited the 
negotiators to the White House for a morning meeting today. Officials said the 
session could be cancelled if they do not have significant progress to report, 
but as of Sunday night they were still planning to meet as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), who have stayed away from the meetings as long as President 
Bush is absent, were expected to join the group today. There was also a chance 
Bush might briefly join the talks after landing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Budget bargainers -- including White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman, 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and more than a dozen lawmakers from both 
parties -- have set a target of cutting spending and raising taxes by enough to 
slash the fiscal 1991 deficit by $50 billion and to save roughly $500 billion 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
As Administration officials and congressional leaders entered the third 
straight day of almost nonstop meetings, it was not clear whether they could 
achieve such an ambitious goal. 
</P>
<P>
In a day of intense back-and-forth bargaining, Democrats were moving closer to 
the GOP position that the Pentagon budget should not be hacked abruptly during 
the current Persian Gulf crisis, sources said. Democrats had originally 
proposed as much as $15 billion in military cuts next year, while Republicans 
wanted to hold the reductions to only about $4 billion. Both sides, however, 
were still looking at ways to achieve substantial military cuts over the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said aides who spoke only on condition they not be identified, the 
two parties were looking at about $10 billion in cuts from benefit programs 
such as Medicare and farm subsides. When the talks began on Friday, Republicans 
proposed more than $15 billion in such cuts, while Democrats suggested 
reductions limited to just over $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, however, were having difficulty working out ways to satisfy White 
House demands that any budget agreement must include mechanisms to ensure that 
it can be enforced over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiators continued to work into the evening, other major hurdles also 
remained. Without an agreement, the deficit for the fiscal year that begins on 
Oct. 1 is expected to soar to as much as $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties have proposed raising taxes and fees by roughly the same $25 
billion next year, but they continued to have widely different ideas about how 
to hit that target. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats favor raising income tax rates for the wealthy to go along with 
boosts in taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and energy consumption, while 
Republicans proposed a variety of revenue raisers, including tax increases for 
wine and beer and limits on state and local tax deductions. They also insisted 
that a cut in taxes on capital gains must be part of any package. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, moved to this isolated site 10 miles from Capitol Hill to keep 
reporters and lobbyists away, are being held in a large room that normally 
serves as the officers' bar. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers have done everything possible to make themselves feel at home. 
The club and its adjacent buildings have been transformed into a small-scale 
imitation of the Capitol, with Democratic and Republican cloakrooms, separate 
buildings to meet behind closed doors, computers to crunch numbers, facsimile 
machines and an extensive telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything has gone according to plan, however. After going until almost 
midnight Friday, the talks broke up unexpectedly about 10 p.m. Saturday night 
when a fire alarm forced everyone to evacuate the building. According to one 
aide, a musician attending a long-scheduled wedding held in the sprawling 
complex inadvertently set off the alarm.

Half a dozen demonstrators unfurled a banner outside the palace where President 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were discussing the gulf crisis. 
The banner was torn down and thrown away by members of the crowd of about 
1,000, police said.

With tens of thousands of its nationals stranded in the Middle East since Iraq 
occupied Kuwait, Bangladesh has begun sending food, water and medicine to 
refugees in Jordan, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the airlift was ordered by President Hussain Mohammed Ershad, who is 
due to leave for Turkey on Wednesday to meet Bangladeshi refugees stranded 
there. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said that more than half the estimated 75,000 
Bangladesh nationals in Kuwait have already left. The government's previous 
figure for Bangladeshis in Kuwait at the time of the invasion was 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Sunday that nearly 10,000 Bangladeshis have been 
flown home from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey and that the rest of those 
marooned in the Middle East were expected to be evacuated by end of September.

IS THE MEDFLY BATTLE REALLY WON?; 
</P>
<P>
IF SO, WE'D BETTER FOCUS ON FOLLOW-UP IN THE FORM OF A PEST RESEARCH BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some $44 million later, the state stands poised to declare victory -- again -- 
over the pesky Mediterranean fruit fly. The state agricultural official who led 
the anti-Medfly effort says he's already devoting more time to other, more 
pedestrian pests like the boll weevil. 
</P>
<P>
All of this calls to mind the words of Mother, upon seeing the stylish outfit 
you were planning to buy for the big school party: "That's nice. But is it 
practical?" 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the Medfly, we have to side with Mother's sentiments. It's 
true that experts are cautiously expressing optimism that the fruit-fly plague 
that has besieged most of Southern California since the summer of 1989 is 
almost over. Of course, state experts were optimistic in May and were proven 
wrong by later Medfly discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be different this time; discoveries of the fly typically follow 
warm weather and the warmest is mostly behind us. But even assuming the Medfly 
battle is declared "won," the Department of Health Services has yet to address 
practical questions. 
</P>
<P>
What about legislators' suggestions that the state complete a "health risk 
assessment" of a pesticide before it can be sprayed on urban neighborhoods? The 
distinction between assessing the health risk and certifying that a pesticide 
is safe is important; health experts emphasize that absolute safety in 
anything, be it a pesticide or the air we breathe, is not something that can be 
guaranteed. Everyone is entitled, however, to know the risks of our 
environment. Thus the state and county should quickly release the results of 
all health tests taken to measure possible effects of people in the spray area. 
</P>
<P>
For the long term, a worthy bill, AB 4161, awaits the governor's signature. The 
bill would create a University of California Center for Pest Research that 
would finally and logically coordinate research and give far greater emphasis 
to non-pesticide methods of battling agricultural pests. 
</P>
<P>
If the governor wants to help the state avoid a rerun of another 
Medfly/malathion panic in the future, he will sign AB 4161.

THE PLIGHT OF YOUNG BLACK MALES IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raspberry shows just how confused one can become when one's own cultural 
perspective has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
Raspberry's comments, like those of many elitist conservatives, totally ignore 
the real reasons for the chronic academic underachievement of young black 
males. 
</P>
<P>
Raspberry says, "I doubt that substituting Chinua Achebe, James Baldwin or Mary 
Frances Berry for William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne or the white authors 
of high-school history texts would significantly raise the relative academic 
performance of black boys." 
</P>
<P>
He later says the problem is caused by a lack of role models. The fact that 
Raspberry does not see the connection between strong cultural self-knowledge 
through reading the works of people like oneself, and how well one feels about 
oneself is painful. The fact that he seems to not view Achebe, Baldwin and 
Berry as role models is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Raspberry says black males ". . . confuse manliness with machismo . . ," that 
being able to "take care of themselves" equates with manhood. 
</P>
<P>
In many areas of the inner city, being able to fight well (or giving that 
appearance) is simply a survival skill. Often, the brash manner of behavior 
Raspberry refers to is only a type of body language designed to ward off 
attack.

THE PLIGHT OF YOUNG BLACK MALES IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with anguish William Raspberry's commentary "When Manhood Is Taught on 
the Streets" (Aug. 28). My initial reaction was simply, here we go again . . 
"We have searched for the Enemy and have found . . . he is us." 
</P>
<P>
Here is an African-American discussing the plight of young black males 
negatively. Can it be that there are no positives to being African-American in 
America or along the diaspora in the world today? 
</P>
<P>
As one of the so-called "black boys" reared in a one-parent household, perhaps 
it is irrelevant that I also hold a college degree, can do calculus (as if 
calculus is the measure of a man or quality of one's education) and have read 
Willie Shakespeare and Nate Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
No one wishes to substitute the so-called classics for African-American 
literature. It is not necessary to justify African-American literature by some 
Eurocentric value statement that "White is right." What is important is that 
African-Americans in America, of all ages and educational levels, learn that 
Africans came before Columbus, that the destruction of black civilization is 
not a myth. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is Raspberry more off base than on the subject of African-American 
family. Are "black boys" supposed to sit quietly and passively on the sidelines 
as the world turns about them? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed? African-Americans can learn whatever is taught. Education is a 
self-serving process. One can only regurgitate what is taught, when tested. 
</P>
<P>
There are positive role models for African-American males. We just need to 
recognize them.

LESS EQUALS MORE AT SUPERPOWER SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
LEADERS AGREE SADDAM MUST BACK DOWN -- THAT'S SOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was something comforting about the casual way Sunday's summit on the 
Persian Gulf crisis ended without bombast or bombshells. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it clear in 
Helsinki that they still want Iraq's Saddam Hussein and his troops out of 
Kuwait immediately, or else. 
</P>
<P>
For different reasons, neither would talk about what "or else" means, deferring 
to the communique's point that if the embargo fails to bring Hussein to his 
senses, " . . . we are prepared to consider additional (measures) consistent 
with the United Nations Charter." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the very absence of surprise is a sure sign that the trip to Helsinki 
was a step forward for both. Their eight hours of conversation did not produce 
a new world order to replace the order of the Cold War -- now fast fading -- as 
some had predicted. It did not make the gulf crisis go away. 
</P>
<P>
But the strong language in which both condemned Iraq and emphasized that 
nothing less than Hussein's forces pulling out of battered Kuwait would be 
acceptable makes it hard to see the result as a "substantial setback," as one 
analyst called it. 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev said, what the meeting was about was another "test of the 
durability" of the new relationship between the United States and the Soviet 
Union to solve crises peaceably. It was a test of the process of diplomacy 
under entirely new management and with new rules that will take some time 
getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush noted, the changes in superpower attitudes that began at Malta and 
continued through Camp David and Helsinki have produced mutual understanding 
that would have been out of the question a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the mugging and horseplay at their Helsinki press conference when 
Gorbachev said he was about to spill a secret without consulting Bush would 
have been unthinkable even months ago. It was not really a secret, anyway: 
Washington no longer denies, as it did for years, a legitimate Soviet role in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
For Saddam Hussein, facing a tightening embargo on exports of oil for the 
dollars that his economy desperately needs and of imports of food and other 
goods that his people need, the summit could not be comforting. With troops 
from the United States and Arab League pouring into the gulf area, he has spent 
more than five weeks in the position of a gangster who has tripped an alarm 
while robbing a bank. Now he hears a police SWAT team outside warning him that 
they're in for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Surely it would be hard to find a citation to document Gorbachev's post-summit 
statement that there is a "solidarity" of world opinion on the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait "which has never been expressed before in the history of the world." 
But the fact that he sees the situation in those terms is as important as 
whether or not it is true. 
</P>
<P>
The summit's success in binding the superpowers together on the crisis will not 
make it any easier on either. The Soviet economy continues to sag sharply and, 
until the embargo, Iraq was a prime source of hard currency for the Soviet 
Union. The earnings on Iraqi oil were swapped for Soviet arms and expertise in 
oil field development. Moscow also could have used payments on $10 billion that 
Baghdad owes the Soviets for arms purchased during its war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States already teetering on the brink of recession, the steep 
rise in oil prices that followed the gulf crisis will drain another $5 billion 
a month from the economy, a gloomy prospect. 
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki summit's contribution to getting Saddam Hussein to back down may 
be less than what Washington and its allies could have asked. But it is more 
than they would have gotten a year ago, and that -- in the real world -- is 
what counts.

IS THIS POLITICAL ACT TOO TOUGH TO FOLLOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SCHRAM, Martin Schram is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the election of 1990, Democrats can take heart in the fact that the public 
is considerably smarter than the politicians and strategists who try to 
game-plan each election campaign. Voters have put their faith in our 
Constitution's separation of powers and take pride in electing Democratic 
senators and representatives who will check and balance their chosen Republican 
President. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats may find much less to cheer about after that. For the 
presidential election of 1992 may be when the true political impact of the 
current Mideast crisis is seen. 
</P>
<P>
The super summit events that dominated our screens this weekend are certainly 
causing some second thoughts within the most private councils of the Mario 
Cuomos and Sam Nunns and Albert Gores and Richard Gephardts and Charles Robbs 
and all other Democrats who may have entertained the notion of running for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
These are Democrats who can all say with confidence that they could lead where 
President Bush has faltered in shaping new policies on issues from the federal 
budget and economy to global warming. But running for President is a very 
personal thing. And so now all prospective Democratic candidates must be 
looking at their TV screens and asking themselves this personal, soul-searching 
question: 
</P>
<P>
Am I confident that I could have responded as swiftly and skillfully -- 
militarily and diplomatically -- as did Bush if the Iraqi crisis happened on my 
presidential watch? 
</P>
<P>
Unless their private answer is a resounding yes, it will be hard for any of 
them to mount a campaign against Bush in 1992, let alone beat him.

</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: FAILED RUN IN PUNTING SITUATION LATE IN GAME SETS DALLAS UP FOR 17-14 
VICTORY. HENNING TAKES BLAME FOR CALLING THE PLAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning took an extra long draw from his cigarette, then took 
his share of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Topic of discussion: Sunday's fake punt that flopped. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in the fourth quarter of the season opener at Texas Stadium, a game 
the Chargers appeared to be controlling. Henning made the call. A block was 
missed. And the Chargers lost, 17-14, to the Dallas Cowboys, a team that has 
now won the same number of games that it did all of last season. One. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't have called (the fake) in that particular situation," Henning 
said. "I told the players 'I called it, and that's my dumb mistake.' " 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 48,063 watched as the Chargers held a 14-10 lead and the ball with 
less than eight minutes to play. Their offense stalled at the Cowboy 48, and 
John Kidd came in to punt. The Chargers had six yards to go. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the plan was to have linebacker Gary Plummer take the snap and run 
left. But when the teams lined up, Plummer noticed the Cowboys had stacked 
seven players on that side, so he called an audible and redirected the play to 
the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Problem was, one Charger nobody would name missed the call and, consequently, 
the key block. Plummer got the snap and barreled ahead, and Cowboy safety Bill 
Bates smashed into him. The play gained two yards, and the Cowboys took over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take responsibility," Plummer said. "It wasn't communicated properly. If 
we would have made that one block, I'd probably still be running." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer didn't question Henning's decision to go for the fake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never going to second-guess a coach's call," he said. "Once the call is 
made, that's our responsibility to execute." 
</P>
<P>
Because they didn't, and because Bates was ready and waiting, the Chargers lost 
their fourth consecutive regular-season opener. It made it fun for the Cowboys. 
Particularly Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never be surprised in a game," Bates said. "You have to ready for 
everything. Fortunately, this 200-pound body was enough to stop that 260-pound 
freight train." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Plummer is only a 240-pound freight train. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys took over at the Charger 49. The key plays on the winning drive 
were a 16-yard run to the 29 by Tommie Agee on fourth and two and quarterback 
Troy Aikman's 24-yard completion to wide receiver Kelvin Martin for a first and 
goal at the one. Martin beat rookie cornerback Donald Frank, who was the target 
of several big plays in last week's exhibition loss to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman finished it with a one-yard sneak with 1:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Henning then replaced starting quarterback Mark Vlasic with Billy Joe Tolliver 
for the final offensive possession. On four plays, Tolliver was one for three 
for three yards and took a 13-yard sack by defensive end Jim Jeffcoat. 
</P>
<P>
Why put Tolliver in with less than two minutes to play? 
</P>
<P>
"He has a stronger arm, and Mark hadn't been throwing the ball as well as he 
had in preseason," Henning said. "I felt like Billy had the opportunity there 
and maybe we could get a spark from him. But we didn't do a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, if the fake punt and ensuing touchdown were the crowning blows, they 
certainly weren't the Chargers' only problems. Sunday's game exposed a number 
of deficiencies that were evident during the exhibition season. Many were the 
result of one factor: inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
In his first regular-season start since November, 1988, Vlasic was less than 
spectacular. He finished with 17 completions in 31 attempts for 137 yards, with 
one touchdown pass and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cowboys drove 84 yards on the opening series to take a 7-0 lead, 
Vlasic led the Chargers on a 62-yard drive that was capped by a 14-yard pass to 
H-back Craig McEwen. Vlasic completed five of six passes for 64 yards on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers scored their only other touchdown in the second quarter, and it 
wasn't a drive for the highlight film. It covered a total of 49 yards, 41 on a 
pass interference penalty on cornerback Issiac Holt. From then on, the Charger 
offense checked out, and Vlasic wasn't able to kick-start it in six tries in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasic was critical of the offense's contributions to the overall effort. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't count on the defense to play our whole dang game," he said. "We have 
to contribute, and I don't think we did a good job of that." 
</P>
<P>
As for Henning's decision to pull him in favor of Tolliver, Vlasic had no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not look for some type of spark?" Vlasic said. "He's a great player. Dan 
and the rest of the team have a lot of confidence in him, and you hope that a 
quick change like that maybe will light some fire." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line, retooled just six days ago with four starters who are 
playing new positions, held its own, surrendering just one sack. But 
run-blocking was inconsistent, and the Chargers managed only 85 yards on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Chargers played much the same as they did throughout last 
season. They stopped the opponent until the game was on the line. Then they 
stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Chargers gave only 14.9 points a game in the final 14 games but 
often lost on late drives. This was more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "We made some mental 
mistakes and they did a great job capitalizing on our mistakes. They came out 
and started the season like we wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost in the last few minutes of so many games. That's what's hardest 
about our losses. I don't care what anybody says, we've just got to find a way 
to win. Period. I don't care if the score is 3-2. We've just got to find a 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Where to from here? Well, first thing is to shake off this loss, which Henning 
indicated wouldn't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to carry it, and I'm going to carry it for a long time because I 
think we are a better football team than the way we played out there today," 
Henning said. "We didn't play very well, and I didn't coach very well. Our 
preparation was my responsibility, and we had too many errors out there." 
</P>
<P>
Which made for a nice home opener for the Cowboys and Jimmy Johnson, who is now 
2-15 in his NFL coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been through a lot since last season's 1-15, and a lot has passed 
unnoticed," he said. "But these guys have worked hard. We had a tough camp, and 
they have done everything possible to get ready for today's opening game. I 
think the effort was outstanding."

REVITALIZED SHOW CRUISING FOR PADRES 
</P>

<P>
Eric Show began his stroll from the Padre bullpen to the mound Sunday 
afternoon, heard his name announced over the public-address system and then 
listened as the boos poured down upon him. 
</P>
<P>
Show just stood there, shrugged his shoulders and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I kind of like it when they boo me," Show said. "When they boo me 
now, I say, 'Watch this . . . 
</P>
<P>
" 'Swallow that popcorn a little harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
And that silence Sunday was the result of Show slamming shut the mouths of his 
critics, helping lead the Padres to a 5-4, 11-inning victory over Atlanta in 
front of a Beach Boys crowd of 28,593 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Show, the man who was supposed to be gone in a trade before the All-Star break, 
who demanded a trade a month ago and who has feuded with his pitching coach, 
Pat Dobson, for most of the season, is haunting those who dared say he was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
Show entered the game in the 10th inning after the Braves tied it in the ninth 
when Mark Lemke's RBI single got past shortstop Garry Templeton. No problem. 
Show pitched two perfect innings to run his consecutive scoreless streak to 15 
1/3, then won his 99th game as a Padre when Brave first baseman Tommy Gregg 
couldn't make a play on Templeton's ground ball, and Phil Stephenson scored the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get 100 wins before I leave here," Show said, "but actually, I 
think I should have had a 100 a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the way he's pitching now, it's only a matter of time before he 
reaches that milestone. Not only is Show preventing the opposition from 
scoring, but opponents are having the hardest time even collecting hits off 
him. Show has allowed just two hits in his past eight innings, and over his 
scoreless streak, he has yielded a total of nine baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
What gives? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say it made me so mad that I took it out on the opposing hitters," 
he said. "That would be the macho, cliche thing that would probably please most 
of the people that have been involved in baseball for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"But hate is not a good motivator for me for a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"And this was long haul. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go through a lot of mental gymnastics." 
</P>
<P>
Show, 34, who has been with the Padre organization longer than any active 
player, still is disturbed at the way he has been treated this season by the 
management. 
</P>
<P>
He was upset when he was bounced from the rotation in May after going 0-5 with 
a 7.88 ERA in his first six starts. 
</P>
<P>
He was livid when he was brought back into the rotation in July, only to be 
knocked out a month later after going 2-2 with a 5.22 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
And he was furious Aug. 12, when he demanded to be traded, accusing the 
organization of mistreatment and lying to him. 
</P>
<P>
But here he was Sunday, surrounded by reporters in front of his locker, saying 
that he finally has learned to overcome every bit of adversity that has been 
thrown his way. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to let it (bitterness) go," Show said, "it was eating me up. I was down 
on myself, everybody was down on me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ashamed to say I lost my desire, but I did." 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame him? 
</P>
<P>
He was struggling miserably on the field, and the harder he tried, the more he 
failed. The fans, who were so supportive of him when he was winning, turned 
their backs. And he was being abused in the press, the scapegoat for all the 
team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he sits and laughs, watching his critics dwindle in size and public 
opinion changing ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I notice things are more polarized," said Show, whose 18-3 record against the 
Braves is the best by an pitcher in the National League. "A cult following of 
people want to worship me on one hand, and there's another that wants to kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what Show accomplishes these last three weeks, there's little 
doubt in anyone's mind that this will be his last season with the Padres. They 
have no plans to pick up the option on a contract that allows him the right to 
submit an arbitration figure of between $1.1 million and $1.7 million, and if 
they can't trade him, they likely will release him. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't really matter to Show. Oh, he's certainly curious to find out where 
he'll be pitching a year from now. But for perhaps the first time this season, 
he's confident that no matter where he is, he'll be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows, maybe I learned through all this that my future should be as a 
reliever," Show said. "Maybe I should have been a reliever all my career. Maybe 
this whole thing has been a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made me work hard mentally, and physically, just battling anger and 
bitterness. And there are days it still haunts me, lurking inside of me. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's been something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, not with the 
way I've been treated." 
</P>
<P>
This is why it was a bit ironic that on the day Show pronounced that he is 
pitching as good as he ever has, the Padres announce they were yanking Calvin 
Schiraldi out of the rotation and giving the starter's job to . . . Derek 
Lilliquist. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried Calvin in the bullpen, and that didn't work out," Padre Manager Greg 
Riddoch said. "So we gave him eight starts in the rotation (1-5, 5.40 ERA), and 
that hasn't worked out too well either. So we decided to give Derek a shot at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
And Show? 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" Show said, "I guess I already had my chance." 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, he'll find out who'll give him a shot at his future. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar had X-rays taken of his left elbow Sunday 
morning, and they showed no serious injury. Alomar is diagnosed with a strain 
of his left ulna collateral ligament. Although he's listed as day-to-day, 
Manager Greg Riddoch said that Alomar could be out for as long as five to 10 
days. . . . OK, now where are those placecards? When Jack McKeon managed the 
Padres in the first-half of the season, he threatened to have placecards made 
up to help his players remember how many outs there were in an inning. Well, in 
the eighth inning Sunday, it happened again. Jim Presley struck out, and Padre 
catcher Benito Santiago rolled the ball back to the mound, running toward the 
dugout. Oops. There were only two outs in the inning. Expect Santiago to be 
paying up in the next Kangaroo Court. . . . Padre starter Andy Benes has 
pitched in eight day games this season and has yet to post a victory. . . . 
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst whooped it up when he learned of BYU's victory 
Saturday over Miami, even shrugging off his teammates' ridicule of reminding 
him that he never attended BYU. The best part? Teammate Tony Gwynn, loser of 
the bet, was forced to don Hurst's BYU cap before the game. . . . The elevator 
broke at the stadium, causing panic among a few folks who were forced to wait 
in it for an hour and 10 minutes until help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre rookie team in Spokane won its fourth consecutive Northwest League 
title with a 4-2 victory Friday night over Boise. . . . 
Who-would-have-thought-dept: Brave reliever Mark Grant proudly noted Sunday he 
is the only player on a major league roster who was traded away by the Padres 
this season. . . . The air-conditioner broke in the Padre clubhouse, making it 
a bit miserable the past five days, but don't expect the Braves to have any 
sympathy. There is no air-conditioning in the visiting clubhouse, the only 
clubhouse in the National League without any. "Have them do something about it, 
will you," said Brave outfielder Lonnie Smith, laughing, "it's killing us."

STARS TURN OUT TO SUPPORT AIDS BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna and a host of top-name stars turned out for AIDS Project Los Angeles' 
fourth annual Commitment to Life benefit Friday, a high-energy show at the 
Wiltern that took an audience of 2,400 through a night of emotional highs and 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop meeting like this," said actress Carol Kane at the beginning 
of the evening, adding, "but if we do meet again, let it be in joyous 
celebration of a cure." 
</P>
<P>
The audience heartily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was one of four honorees, along with artist David Hockney, congressman 
Henry Waxman and British actor Ian McKellen, who were singled out for their 
contributions on different fronts to AIDS causes. APLA is an 8-year-old 
nonprofit organization that assists people with AIDS by offering services such 
as support and counseling groups, dental treatment, transportation services and 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Their awards were given intermittently throughout a two-hour show that featured 
the peroxided Madonna opening the show with "Vogue," performed in a Marie 
Antoinette costume (skirt occasionally lifted to reveal petticoats, naturally). 
Others on the bill included comedian Michael Colyar, singers Toni Childs, 
Melissa Etheridge, Sarah Brightman and Rod Stewart; Burt Bacharach and Herb 
Alpert performing a duet; violinist Joshua Bell; dance group Brat Pack; Jo Beth 
Williams reading Paul Monette poems, Bruce Davison and Alfre Woodard, and Sam 
Harris, Brenda Russell and the Diva Choir in a closing number. Vince Paterson 
directed the show, which was produced by Barry Krost, Bernie Taupin and Barry 
Josephson. The event raised approximately $1.15 million for APLA. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna came on stage in a pin-stripe suit with garter belts dangling to say, 
"I'm very honored to receive this award. In the back of my mind I feel that I 
don't really deserve it; in fact, I feel a little guilty. Because it's very 
easy to lend your name to a celebrity fund-raiser if you're famous, and it's 
very easy to donate money to AIDS research if you're rich. What isn't easy is 
changing the way people think. While the AIDS epidemic is wreaking havoc on 
this planet, it's also released a wave of homophobia that is truly frightening. 
. . . It takes a lot of courage these days to come out and say, 'I'm gay,' but 
it takes a . . . warrior to come out and say, 'I have AIDS.' 
</P>
<P>
"These are the people who deserve awards so much more than me. So to the 
handful of people that I have known and loved dearly who have died of AIDS, to 
the thousands I have heard about and to the millions I will never know, I share 
this award with you. You are my heroes." 
</P>
<P>
Ian McKellen said that publicly declaring himself gay "hasn't done my career 
any harm. I was actor of the year in London last year, I played John Profumo in 
the film 'Scandal,' and all that anybody knows about Profumo is that he's a 
raging heterosexual. It's lovely out of the closet. . . !" 
</P>
<P>
And Waxman reminded the audience: "It's important during this flood of sadness 
for us to keep clear memories of our friends and loved ones as they would want 
to be recalled. I also invite you to celebrate the people who have not died, 
the people with AIDS and HIV who have survived, who are thriving, and who may 
soon make this a disease that is beaten and is over." 
</P>
<P>
Among the celebrities who acted as presenters, ushers or who just showed up, 
were Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, Tim Curry, Valerie Harper, Rob Lowe, 
James Woods, Marlee Matlin, Bette Midler, Anjelica Huston, Whoopi Goldberg, Jon 
Lovitz, Danny Glover, Corbin Bernsen, Dan Aykroyd, Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave, 
Sarah Jessica Parker, Robert Downey Jr., Richard Grieco, Meredith 
Baxter-Birney, Lainie Kazan, Jimmy Smits, Ricki Lake and Faith Ford. Chairing 
the event were Krost, Mark Canton and Harold Huttas. 
</P>
<P>
In five years, the very tenor of the Commitment to Life benefit has changed. 
Speeches are more impassioned as people recalled friends and lovers who are 
HIV-positive or who have died from complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night there were mentions of outing, of children dying of AIDS and of 
censorship, the last point brought home when photographs by the late, 
controversial photographer Robert Mapplethorpe were shown on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The great buzz of excitement during the show carried over into the post-party 
at the nearby Atlas Bar and Grill, where guests were squished up against each 
other in a true survival-of-the-fittest test. Whoever could breathe and get to 
the food definitely won.

IN BRIEF: FRED FINCH CENTER TO CELEBRATE CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fred Finch Youth Center, a center for the treatment of emotionally 
disturbed adolescents, will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush has agreed to be the honorary chairwoman of the 
centennial committee. 
</P>
<P>
The center is conducting a nationwide search for former residents, who are 
asked to contact the Centennial Alumni Committee, Fred Finch Youth Center, 3800 
Coolidge Ave., Oakland, Calif. 94602, or Helen Greenwalt at (415) 933-2401. 
</P>
<P>
The center began as an orphanage in 1891 housing such notables as writer 
William Saroyan. After 100 years, it is still serving children but has shifted 
its focus to the treatment of emotionally disturbed adolescents.

STREET SCENE'S SWEET SOUND OF SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: PRESENTATION OF 46 ACTS WENT OFF WITH FEW GLITCHES AND HELPED MAKE THE 
DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO POP MUSIC FESTIVAL A NOTABLE SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Promoter Rob Hagey has often said he'd one day like to see San Diego's Michelob 
Street Scene become as big, musically diverse, and successful as the celebrated 
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from last weekend's event, the eighth Street Scene in seven years, that 
day might come a lot sooner than he'd hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Friday and Saturday night, 46 acts played on eight stages in a 12-block section 
of the Gaslamp Quarter. Last year, the music festival lasted only one night, 
and included 18 acts on six stages, in an area of eight downtown blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of this year's acts was so great that walking through the 
festival was something like a ride through Disneyland's Small World, with each 
street corner taking you to a new and different musical world: rock 'n' roll, 
blues, jazz, country, reggae, Cajun, zydeco, Latin, gospel, and worldbeat. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd last weekend was the largest ever: last year 17,500 attended, 
this year 22,000 came on Friday night and nearly 18,000 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The best news of all, however, is that the fast expansion was achieved without 
the growing pains you'd expect. In fact, Michelob Street Scene '90 was even 
smoother than Street Scenes of recent years. And the credit goes to both good 
planning and good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were more stages, they were far enough apart to virtually 
eliminate sound overlap, a persistent problem in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
And despite its record size, the crowd was remarkably well behaved. No fights, 
no out-of-control mob scenes, few obvious drunks. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's because there were more places to buy alcohol -- more 21-and-up 
beer gardens, more open bars and nightclubs -- resulting in shorter lines and 
fewer frustrating long waits. 
</P>
<P>
The only real problems were minor ones. There weren't enough trash cans, for 
example, and organizers had underestimated the popularity of the Bourbon Street 
area, with its two Cajun/Zydeco stages: On Saturday night, from about 8 p.m. 
on, the line to get in was at least a block long. 
</P>
<P>
However the music, for the most part, couldn't have been better. Friday night's 
biggest crowd-pleaser was the British reggae band Steel Pulse, who closed the 
Reggae/Worldbeat Stage, at Seventh Avenue and J Street, with a riveting 
90-minute set. On Saturday, it was Texas blues guitarist Johnny Winter, whose 
trio delivered an equally compelling closing performance on the Blues Stage at 
Seventh Avenue and L Street. 
</P>
<P>
Other Friday-night highlights included dynamic performances by the Soviet rock 
band Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik and San Diego's Beat Farmers on the Seventh 
and L Stage; Louisiana's Beausoleil, with their festive Cajun music, on the 
East Cajun Stage at Sixth Avenue and Island Street; and ex-Animal singer Eric 
Burdon and ex-Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, with their updated recyclings of 
classic Animals tunes like "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood," "We Gotta Get Out 
of This Place," and "See See Rider," on the Rock Stage at Third Avenue and J 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Beat Farmers's set was preceded by a wedding ceremony between 
singer-guitarist Joey Harris and his longtime sweetheart. Country Dick Montana, 
the group's drummer, and a mail-order minister with the universal life church, 
married the two. The group then opened with "Girl I Almost Married" but changed 
the lyrics to "Girl I Just Got Married." 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights on Saturday night were performances by Katie Webster, the 
two-fisted piano-pounding protege of the late Otis Redding, on the Blues/Jazz 
Stage at Fifth Avenue and K Street; gospel group Clarence Fountain and the Five 
Blind Boys of Alabama on the Blues Stage; Buckwheat Zydeco on the East Zydeco 
Stage at Sixth and Island; salsa king Willie Colon and Legal Alien on the Latin 
Stage at Third Avenue and J Street; and the Desert Rose Band, led by former 
Byrd Chris Hillman, on the Country Stage at Seventh Avenue and J Street. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, in particular, was a delight. Holding court behind a grand piano her 
sensuous swamp boogie made it difficult for anyone to stand still. Toward the 
end of her set there was a poignant moment: Webster dedicated a bluesy 
rendition of Dire Straits' "So Far Away" to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were a couple of disappointments. The Strawberry Alarm Clock's 
Friday-night set on the Rock Stage at Third Avenue and J Street drew a sparse 
crowd, and with good reason: The psychedelic-rock dinosaurs, best known for 
their 1967 hit, the flower-power anthem "Incense and Peppermints," sounded 
dated. They should not be invited back. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should Stan Ridgway, formerly with the pioneering new wavers Wall of 
Voodoo. His musically intriguing hour-long performance Saturday night on the 
Rock Stage at Third Avenue and K Street was marred by banal between-song patter 
("I'm a sissy, but I'm a rich sissy") and a particularly silly, cliched closing 
diatribe ("We have a lot more to give you, but Michelob won't allow it"). 
</P>
<P>
What made this year's Street Scene even more of a culturally enlightening 
experience was the fact that the handful of food booths around each stage 
mirrored the ethnicity of the music. 
</P>
<P>
Chowing down red beans and spicy Cajun sausage while Beausoleil, the Bad Boys 
of Zydeco, Buckwheat Zydeco, and C.J. Chenier and the Red Hot Louisiana took 
turns on the two Bourbon Street stages was about as close to the real Bourbon 
Street as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most of the food was overpriced -- as it always is at these 
affairs -- and at least one Gaslamp Quarter restaurant in the enclosed area 
that remained open during Michelob Street Scene '90 got a little greedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Blarney Stone was selling corned-beef sandwich halves for $3, both inside 
the restaurant and at a booth across the street. The regular price is $4.50 for 
a whole sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish diner-pub was also charging "entertainment" prices for drinks, even 
though the entertainment was outside, on the street, the nearest stage two 
blocks away.

American in Paris -- Not San Diego: American soprano Diana Soviero, 44, 
scheduled to sing the role of Violetta in the San Diego Opera production of 
Verdi's "La Traviata" in May, will instead perform with the Paris Opera in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera officials said Friday they will seek damages but did not 
disclose the amount. Ian Campbell, general director of the opera, said he 
learned of Soviero's withdrawal by reading a Paris Opera brochure. He said that 
the singer had asked last May to be released from her contract for the Paris 
engagement, but had been denied because he felt that he owed his audience the 
promised performance.BETH KLEID

More Minority Writers at Fox: An aggressive search for minority writers for Fox 
television programming has begun, Fox Inc. said Friday. Fox Chairman Barry 
Diller said the goal will be to increase the number of minority writers, and he 
pledged that at least one minority writer trainee will be assigned to each 
series produced by 20th Century Fox Television and for those series aired by 
Fox Broadcasting Co. Like the recent minority writers hiring program announced 
by the Walt Disney Studios, Fox is working with the Writers Guild of America 
West and various minority organizations. BETH KLEID

New Ojai Fest Head: Englishman Christopher Hunt, who directed the $4.2-million 
Pepisco SummerFare outside New York City, has been named consulting director of 
the three-day, late-spring music festival in Ventura County. Hunt, 43, says his 
goals are to "perpetuate a wonderful tradition" and eliminate an estimated 
$90,000 deficit -- the largest in the festival's history. The red ink came from 
last June's event, which generated less-than-expected ticket revenue, followed 
by a fund-raising shortfall. BETH KLEID

The Los Angeles Festival's emphasis on cultural diversity serves to remind us 
how culturally mixed the vocabulary of contemporary visual art has become. The 
festival, with its mandate to focus on the arts of the Southland's various 
ethnic groups, combined with the afterglow of the Museum of Contemporary Art's 
just-closed "A Primal Spirit," has made it abundantly clear that the work of 
contemporary visual artists cannot justifiably be roped off into isolated 
cultural communities. The artists may indeed base their work on their own 
heritage, but increasingly they are deeply affected by the conceptual movements 
and vocabulary of Western art that makes them participants in the 
globe-trotting '90s' "internationalization" of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Voices From the African-American Community," curated by Josine Ianco-Starrels, 
presents five male black artists enmeshed in their community and heritage yet 
speaking with the cosmopolitan tongue of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the show's strongest work is by two photographers. Dennis Olanzo 
Callwood's boldly graphic black-and-white photographs of closely cropped black 
legs, hands and faces have the straightforward emotional bluntness of all 
documentary photography. Carefully composed into a vaguely abstract harmony of 
shapes, these images are compelling encounters with an unexpected reservoir of 
silence. Willie Middlebrook's greatly enlarged silver prints unite innovative 
darkroom techniques with emotion laden portraiture. These tender images of 
family and friends emerge from their dripping, liquid grounds to gingerly avoid 
schmaltz by the strength of their scale and careful manipulation of the image 
by the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dickson's off-the-wall humor moves unencumbered between primitive and 
modern art. It is responsible for the wild-wheeled chariot "Bongo Kongo: 
Mobilization of the Spirit" and the color-spewing, formalized nonsense of 
"Tabernacle." Dickson is an enigma to be watched. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings by Frank Williams are less interesting. Their penchant for idealized, 
emotional self-portraits painted in acid, artificial color hits you over the 
head with messages of confinement and alienation. Only in the triptych pastels 
"Rhythm" does that sense of strangeness link up with something really deep. The 
combination of three disparate images allows the landscape and human 
vulnerability to undergo a ritual transformation into something foreign, 
ominous and ancient. Mathew Thomas' pigment- and clay-encrusted paintings 
easily get bogged down in their thick surface explorations and all the visual 
references to Zen emptiness and religious icons. Not until the surface becomes 
a literal ground for strangely shaped totemic forms suspended in front of the 
painting does the rich color and the painting's form begin to vibrate into 
something wonderfully alive. (Long Beach Art Assn. Gallery, 447 Long Beach 
Blvd., to Sept. 24.) 
</P>
<P>
Urban Debris: California painter Raymond Saunders is a world-traveling black 
artist whose work internalizes the cultures and imagery of the cities where he 
immerses himself. He collects pieces of signage, bits of old wrapping paper or 
other fragments of urban debris. He slaps this clutter onto large, black, 
painted grounds that read like old blackboards, newly asphalted streets or 
cosmopolitan billboards. Then he unites the whole with a loose structure of 
marks, hand lettering, graffiti or calligraphic splashes of bright, pure color. 
Even though the elements are spread around the black canvas panels like idle 
thoughts in the middle of the night, they maintain an intriguing sense of 
internal order. 
</P>
<P>
If Saunders' paintings refer to his world travels, they are also right at home 
patching together concepts of abstraction and representation in a single image. 
In this freewheeling kind of formal exploration of painting's limits, Saunders 
goes several directions at once. On one hand, the paintings muse about issues. 
When that issue is the art world, as it is in one untitled painting, Saunders 
can present tiny, perfectly lovely, chalk rendered images of "primary form" 
eggs tumbled against the quiet cynicism of paint-by-numbers realism and 
elementary school hopscotch games of get-it-right advancement. 
</P>
<P>
But in "Sameness in Etcetera" the artist shows that he can be intellectually 
formal by involving the painting's surface in a broad explosion of radiant 
color while intentional and random marks do battle for dominance. (Santa Monica 
College Art Gallery, 1900 Pico Blvd., to Oct. 27.) 
</P>
<P>
Sound and Vision: East meets West in an exhibit of the same name at the Woman's 
Building, where Japanese artist Mineko Grimmer presents two of her 
always-appealing sound sculptures made with wooden boxes and dripping pyramids 
of frozen pebbles. As her structures go, these are particularly simple 
constructions relying on a single bar of brass or two strands of metal guitar 
wire to generate sound from the falling pebbles. But the addition of a strong 
side light on each shallow water-filled box means that the back wall is awash 
with moving reflections as the water is disturbed by each icy drip or pebble 
drop. It's a lovely animated display that makes full use of the subtle visual 
elements for which the artist is known. 
</P>
<P>
Also showing are the small but haunting gouache on paper paintings of Hilary 
Baker. Reminiscent of Ed Ruscha's recent prints of contemporary icons, these 
linear drawings float mundane items like power lines, tractors and fences in a 
colored atmosphere of isolation and containment. As images of a rural America, 
these drawings are nondescript, thin to the point of being invisible and laced 
with a sense of desolation and holocaust. (The Woman's Building, 1727 N. Spring 
St., to Sept. 29.)

When Los Angeles artist Francesco Siqueiros visited colleagues in Mexico City, 
he discovered something exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taken by their group projects and by the discussions they held every 
week," Siqueiros says. "It was stimulating talking about art issues." 
</P>
<P>
He was so moved by their group sharing and cooperation that he wanted to tell 
the world about it. Or at least Southern California. "How could I bring these 
artists to Los Angeles?" he asked himself. 
</P>
<P>
Siqueiros pictured the two art communities meeting each other and opening the 
lines of communication through an exhibition and art workshop. He proposed the 
idea to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 1988 but he says he "got a lot 
of bureaucratic run-around from them. They didn't know what to do with this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than putting together a show just for viewing. I wanted something 
with the intellectual friction and historical tension that exists between the 
two countries," Siqueiros says. 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his idea to friends at a party, Siqueiros was told to go to Edward 
Leffingwell, then the new director at Barnsdall's Municipal Art Gallery in 
Hollywood. Leffingwell, Siqueiros learned, had been exploring a similar idea. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was Siqueiros' vision of getting together onto the same stage Mexican 
as well as Mexican-American artists that won Leffingwell's interest. He 
extended the city's support through the auspices of the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, with additional financing from the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
What Siqueiros and Leffingwell, along with co-curator Gabriela Cortines, have 
assembled is Aqui y Alla (translation: Here and Over There), an exhibition of 
contemporary works by Nahum Zenil, Diego Toledo, Eloy Tarcisio, Ruben Rosas, 
Mario Rangel Faz, Ruben Ortiz Torres, Monica Castillo of Mexico City and Victor 
Estrada, Yreina Cervantez, Anthony Zepeda, Margaret Garcia, John Valadez, Frank 
Romero and Patssi Valdez of Los Angeles. The exhibit will run through Nov. 4 at 
the Barnsdall Park Arts Center. In addition, the artists will meet this month 
and next in several panel discussions on contemporary Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will also be shown in Tijuana and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Leffingwell promises that the exhibit "will be about ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Like those of Patssi Valdez of East L.A., a painter who now deals extensively 
with on-site installations. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work with chance," she says. "Life is chance. We never know what's 
going to come in life." 
</P>
<P>
Chance is not an element of Yreina Cervantez's art. The daughter of farm 
workers, she paints images of her inner pain and conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"My work uses personal symbolism and cultural symbolism," the Los Angeles 
artist says, "but it gets back to identity, which is so important. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be open up to our experiences. We're all very different, but there 
are basic truths. Art manifests changes in the community. As artists, we have 
responsibilities. We are visionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Facing the past and placing it into perspective, as Cervantez has done on a 
personal level, is what the Chicano art movement is about, she says. 
</P>
<P>
However, Victor Estrada of Los Angeles warns against any temptation to 
categorize the Chicano art movement as solely political. To do so, he says, 
implies that Chicano artists cannot do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to the ability to express one's self? The social issues are going 
to come out in the work anyway," he says defending his abstract style. "Some 
artists make their art specific, and in other's the issues just come out. 
</P>
<P>
"The more room there is for difference, the greater power art has. If you try 
to control culture, it's another form of facism. Artistically, people have to 
assume their right to exist. Freedom is not given, it's taken." 
</P>
<P>
But master printer Anthony Zepeda of Los Angeles says he could never be 
political with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"My art is more like poetry," he says. "It's the only way I know how to express 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda says he views the Aqui y Alla exhibition as an expression of ethnic and 
artistic pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in this particular show because I want my father to come see 
it," he says of his father who migrated to the United States in 1905 during the 
Mexican Revolution. "He's essentially more Mexican than me. I want him to be 
happy that it's happening."

THE CHARM OF LIKAY THEATER OF THAILAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the L.A. Festival is trying to reveal Los Angeles' new multiculturalism to 
itself, nowhere is it doing it better than in its ethnic-specific venues. 
</P>
<P>
How much people outside each community will enjoy this cultural smorgasbord 
will depend on how adventuresome they are, how tolerant of qualitative 
unevenness and of the haphazardness of some of the technical arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
That the communities themselves are enjoying the spotlight on their cultures 
was clear Saturday at North Hollywood's Wat Thai temple, one of three venues 
where the Likay theater of Thailand performed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
This unusual-to-us form of largely improvised theater, song and dance is 
described in the program as derived from a variety of earlier forms, including 
Buddhist and Moslem chantings of the late 19th Century. It is a charmingly 
informal theater that sets up on street corners and parks to perform four hours 
at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In those hours, audiences are free to come and go, talk, eat, drink and 
interrupt with direct gifts of money to favorite players. This was achieved at 
Wat Thai by the sale of leis and paper chains that audience members gleefully 
strung around performers' necks. Interruption seemed almost de rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
The appealing company was Boonlert Sit Homhuan, headed by Boonlert Natphinit, a 
disciple of Homhuan ("late doyen of Likay"), who also performed. By Western 
perceptions Likay is fairly static, drawn-out theater, with continuous musical 
accompaniment (the respected Duriyapraneet Ensemble of Thailand provided it), a 
good deal of dance, song, physical comedy and sweetly good-humored addresses to 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The women, garbed in vivid floor-length gowns, and the men in traditional, 
richly beaded costume, unfolded an ongoing soap opera of love, jealousy, 
intrigue and adultery that never seemed to grow too serious or to end. A game 
attempt at translation was scuttled by poor miking, but everything else came 
over that mike, including announcements of lost babies and illegally parked 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
It was precisely these colloquialisms, the interweaving of joking asides to 
L.A. and the festival and the gentle interaction with the audience that made it 
special -- that, along with the opportunity to flesh out the experience by 
tasting Thai food sold at various stands. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, this writer stopped by Griffith Park to catch yet another 
free play (and bite of rye) by the Bread and Puppet Theatre. This time it was 
"The Same Boat," an illustrated piece about political corruption and the 
importance of preserving the Amazon rain forest. The pastoral venue, stirring 
choral singing, large puppets and larger imagination made this a delicious 
event. Bread and Puppet has added a final free Domestic Resurrection Circus at 
Santa Monica Pier noon Saturday.

Screens today at 8 p.m. at Los Feliz Theater, 1822 N. Vermont Ave., Hollywood; 
Thursday at 6 p.m. at Melnitz Theater, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
This Indonesian film -- the equivalent to an American liberal "problem" soap 
opera -- confronts a stalwart matriarch with a seemingly endless series of 
romantic and social quandaries inflicted by her offspring, ranging from 
adultery to miscegenation to simple bad manners. The images are wide-screen and 
colorful, the decor sedately middle-class, and the actors restrained. 
</P>
<P>
As a contrast, the film juxtaposes, against all this bourgeois comfort and 
dissonance, a violent period melodrama: a stage play in which one of the 
mother's sons has an inappositely daredevil role. Interesting only as a 
seemingly realistic reflection of Indonesian culture and family life, "Mother," 
despite all the sibling trouble and turbulence, never explodes into much 
dramatic fire or emotion. It's not exactly a lifeless film, but it's certainly 
a careful one. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

'MULLIGAN' HAS UPBEAT MESSAGE FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on Virginia Lee Burton's popular children's story about the conflict 
between progress and tradition, "Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel" (airing 
tonight at 7 on HBO cable) inaugurates the new "HBO Storybook Musicals" series 
on a pleasantly upbeat note. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel, Mary Anne, work happily and hard, digging 
canals and railroad beds and basements for skyscrapers, especially when a crowd 
is watching. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne is half machine, half pet dinosaur, as the original illustrations 
suggested: In a warm, playful moment, she catches shovels of dirt as Mike 
tosses them in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Their idyllic existence comes to an end when bigger, more powerful electric, 
diesel and gasoline shovels replace them on the job: No more steam shovels are 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Mary Anne leave the city for the small town of Popperville, where they 
agree to dig the cellar for the new town hall in a single day or the work will 
be free. They get so involved trying to meet their deadline and please the 
people who have gathered to watch that they forget to leave an exit ramp. An 
ingenious plan saves the day, and all ends as happily as it began. 
</P>
<P>
Produced and directed by Michael Sporn, the animation in "Mike Mulligan" is 
minimal but effectively used. Robert Klein, who adapted and expanded the story, 
makes a genial narrator.CHARLES SOLOMON

A SENTIMENTAL 'JOSHUA'S HEART' HAS A TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Joshua's Heart," airing at 9 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, is unabashed 
romantic bathos with a slight twist. 
</P>
<P>
This Melissa Gilbert vehicle about a woman who finds it more painful to be 
separated from her boyfriend's 10-year-old son than from her boyfriend, takes 
off midway to become the story of a little boy looking for his piece of the 
Norman Rockwell dream. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is Claudia, a commercial artist and struggling children's author. She 
meets busy architect Tom (Tim Matheson), who moves her into his classy beach 
home as live-in lover and surrogate mom to Joshua (Matthew Lawrence, an 
outstanding child actor). 
</P>
<P>
The romance breaks up, but Joshua, lonely and needy, who adored Claudia, calls 
the local child welfare services and offers himself for adoption, to be with 
Claudia. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Joshua's mom, a dancer who ran away when he was 5, but who now wants a 
second chance with her son. Enter too, a psychiatric social worker (Lorinne 
Vozoff) to investigate whether Josh is being abused or neglected. 
</P>
<P>
From here on, it's Lawrence's film, not Gilbert's, as the plot focuses on 
Josh's quest for emotional security. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue can be wince-making -- "You're so lovely, bright, shining and lit 
up from the inside" -- and the ending is shamelessly sentimental, but the cast 
often rises above the soap suds, and Susan Cuscuna's script has several telling 
moments. LYNNE HEFFLEY

2 KILLED AS GANGS TURN PARTY INTO BATTLEGROUND; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: GIRL, 16, AND MAN, 26, DIE. SIX PEOPLE ALSO ARE WOUNDED AT LARGE 
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION IN PARAMOUNT. 
</P>

<P>
A teen-ager's birthday party in Paramount turned into a bloody melee early 
Sunday when feuding gang members started declaring their allegiances and then 
opened fire on one another, killing two and wounding six among a crowd 
estimated at 200, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The door of a Ford Mustang, a large splotch of dried blood, smashed beer cans 
and bullet-riddled cars dotted the hot pavement in the 15300 block of Castana 
Street on Sunday as remnants of the Los Angeles area's most recent weekend of 
gang bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a 59-year-old pedestrian in downtown Los Angeles and an 11-year-old 
bystander near Torrance were among at least four others who died over the 
weekend as the result of suspected gang activities, even as authorities 
arrested 326 people in raids targeting gang members. 
</P>
<P>
At the Paramount party, "there must have been five gangs here and the guys, 
they just don't get along," said Raul Medina, whose 15-year-old sister -- 
herself a gang member -- was throwing herself a birthday celebration. "The guys 
started throwing their gangs out and then came the guns -- 30, 40 of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the shooting and all the screaming started,' said Medina, who was 
released by sheriff's investigators after questioning. "It was like the . . . 
Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
As neighbors cleaned up the mess Sunday, Jaime Olmos stood beside his wrecked 
car and tried to figure out why gang members had decided to smash it with a 
brick. A few houses down, 49-year-old machinist Aurelio Cruz questioned why 
deputies didn't break up the party hours earlier, when they responded to 
complaints about noise and yelling. 
</P>
<P>
And across the street, gang members wondered if the incident would spoil plans 
for their next party. 
</P>
<P>
"Naaah," said one young man, who identified himself only as Pancho Villa. "Next 
party next Saturday!" 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had several people in custody Sunday, but did not release the 
names of any possible suspects or the victims in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Killed by gunfire were a 16-year-old girl and a 26-year-old man. One man was 
hospitalized in very critical condition on life-support systems, another in 
critical condition, another in serious condition and two in stable condition. A 
sixth victim was treated and released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence appeared to mirror a pair of disturbing trends detected this year 
by Los Angeles-area authorities: a 135% jump in Latino-on-Latino gang murders, 
up to 47 through August; and a 69% increase in gang killings within 
unincorporated areas of the county that are patrolled by the Sheriff's 
Department, up to 103. 
</P>
<P>
Participants said almost all the gang members in the Paramount brawl were from 
among five or more local rival Latino factions. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started about 2 a.m., witnesses said, when some youths began 
flashing gang signs and calling out their affiliations, as if to challenge 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Several gang members jumped a rival as his buddies fled, hitting him repeatedly 
over the head with a beer keg and leaving him "a vegetable," in the words of 
one witness. Fistfights spilled into the street and soon shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sleeping and my brother came into my room and said, 'They're shooting!' 
said one 15-year-old neighborhood boy, who did not give his name for fear of 
gang retaliation. "Everybody was screaming. I didn't want to look outside the 
window because the bullets might come in." 
</P>
<P>
A gang member said: "These people have really good guns. If they're going to 
shoot somebody, they want to kill 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arriving on the scene stopped a speeding car and found a shotgun 
inside. Six passengers -- four women and two men -- were detained as possible 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Another shotgun and four other guns were also confiscated separately. 
</P>
<P>
In other local weekend violence: 
</P>
<P>
* Yun Choi, 20, of Norwalk was shot and killed early Sunday after arguing with 
a group of at least six men on 219th Street in Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
* An unidentified man was shot and killed early Sunday after an argument with 
another man downtown. Police were seeking a suspected gang member. 
</P>
<P>
* Shirley Arnel, 59, died Saturday of injuries sustained earlier in the week 
when she was standing on a downtown corner and was struck by a stray bullet 
believed fired by a gang member. A teen-age boy was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
* Jose Gonzales, 11, was shot and killed Friday evening as he stood talking 
with friends in the driveway of his home near Torrance. The bullet, fired from 
a passing car, was apparently meant for a gang member also standing on the 
street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Operation Hammer, the city's anti-gang offensive, Los Angeles police over 
the weekend targeted Westside and San Fernando Valley streets and made 326 
arrests, nearly half of them believed to be gang members. Charges ranged from 
misdemeanor traffic violations to assault, drugs and robbery, police said.

L.A. WILTS AS TEMPERATURES SOAR; FORECAST CALLS FOR MORE OF SAME; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: THE HEAT IS EXPECTED TO LAST AT LEAST THROUGH TUESDAY. THREE SWIMMERS 
APPARENTLY DROWN.

A high-pressure system that stalled over Southern California drove inland 
temperatures into the low 100s Sunday and made most other areas nearly as 
miserable, but not enough to set records. 
</P>
<P>
At Castaic Lake, two people apparently drowned in separate accidents, sheriff's 
deputies said. Sandra Delion, 13, of Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia at 12:54 p.m. She had been swimming 
with friends when she disappeared in about five feet of water, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 5 p.m. an unidentified man, who reportedly had drunk several 
beers with a friend, jumped from a rented rowboat to cool off and apparently 
drowned, deputies said. But searchers failed to recover the man's body. 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, riptides combined with moderate beach crowds to keep 
lifeguards busy. An unidentified woman drowned at Dockweiler State Beach while 
taking a pre-dawn swim alone. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon high of 99 at the Los Angeles Civic Center was three degrees 
short of the record 102 set in 1956, said Steve Burback, meteorologist for 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said there was nothing particularly unusual about the heat wave. The 
humidity, which has been high at times during the summer, was a relatively low 
21%. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place where it will be nice will be at the beaches," Burback said, 
adding that there is no relief in sight, at least until after Tuesday. "It's 
just plain hot." 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Rick Dempsey, behind the plate for the entire 
nine innings in Sunday's 6-4 victory over Cincinnati, it wasn't just hot, "it 
was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said it probably was the hottest game he has caught and he has played 
in parts of four decades. And there was no way to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
"You just get down and sweat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium organist Nancy Hefley did her best to help the sweltering crowd, 
playing "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 675,000 people trekked to county beaches to escape the heat, said 
county lifeguard Capt. Robert Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good, solid crowd but it's not a maximum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two-to-four foot surf and riptides on southwest facing beaches resulted in 
about 150 rescues, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
"You start making over 100 rescues a day and you're pretty active." 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona, no serious health problems were 
reported by fair-goers, possibly because air conditioning was installed in 
exhibit halls last year, said spokesman Sid Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 105 at 3 o'clock," Robinson reported. "People are finding cool places. 
Nobody's jumping in the ponds, but they're staying cool as best they can." 
</P>
<P>
Other high temperatures in the area Sunday included 108 at Ontario, 102 in 
Northridge and 100 in Newhall, according to WeatherData.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home, sweet Los Angeles Coliseum home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Why leave home when you've won seven consecutive games there as the Raiders 
have since Art Shell replaced Mike Shanahan as head coach last Oct. 3? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The silver and black couldn't have asked for much better support than the 
54,206 fans gave them on a sweltering Sunday afternoon that would have been 
spent more wisely at the beach or pool side . . . 
</P>
<P>
The crowd made such a ruckus that the Denver Broncos barely could hear the 
signals being called when they were deep in their own territory in the west 
end, which was quite often. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raider offense was deadly dull, but their high-scoring defense was 
something to behold. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My favorite Howie Long gem on a day of several: Denver had a first down on the 
Raider 25-yard line in the first quarter when John Elway handed the ball to 
Bobby Humphrey. Long rocketed off the line of scrimmage, got to Humphrey the 
same time the ball did and threw him for a three-yard loss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An underrated inside linebacker is Tom Benson, who came to the Raiders from New 
England as a Plan B free agent and led them in tackles last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder, the victim of some butter-fingered receivers, was better than 
his numbers indicate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen deserves more playing time next week in Seattle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Avid sports fan Magic Johnson stood on the sidelines next to the Raider bench, 
wearing a "Commitment to Excellence" T-shirt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before Anthony Dilweg is inducted into the Hall of Fame -- or beats out Don 
Majkowski for the Green Bay Packer starting quarterback job -- he will have to 
prove his worth against something more formidable than a banged-up Ram defense 
that isn't that much to begin with. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scratch the fake punt from San Diego Charger Coach Dan Henning's playbook. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds remind me of a thoroughbred who sets such blistering early 
fractions that he wins despite tightening up and staggering down the home 
stretch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Umpires have become a sensitive lot, indeed, but Dodger outfielder Kal Daniels 
was out of line when he went berserk after being ejected from Saturday night's 
game by Gary Darling. 
</P>
<P>
And why risk getting booted out of what was the most important game of the year 
by protesting a strike call? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's surprising that the slimmed-down Tom Lasorda had the strength to slam 
Daniels to the ground. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There was a ban on beer Saturday at the Rose Bowl, but UCLA still managed to 
drive some of its fans to drink with an opening-day performance against 
Oklahoma that brought back unhappy memories of 1989. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Homer Smith was awfully conservative in his return as UCLA offensive 
coordinator, especially early in the first quarter when the Bruins ran the ball 
three consecutive times from the Oklahoma 26, 25 and 22-yard lines. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot was redshirt freshman quarterback Tommy Maddox, who has a 
strong arm and displayed uncommon poise in relief of Jim Bonds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now the question is whether to give Bonds another chance against Stanford in 
the Rose Bowl Saturday or switch to Maddox? Maybe you go with Bonds and make a 
change early if he fails to move the team again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Compare Bonds' attitude -- "the offense sputters, you expect a change," he said 
after being lifted -- with that of departed Bret Johnson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best seats in the Rose Bowl Saturday were in the last row behind the goal 
posts, beneath the scoreboards that provided the only shade on a hot day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here's what's good about a 50-7 game: In Gainesville, Fla., 75,428 people were 
able to take their minds off the murders of five students and yell themselves 
hoarse as Florida trounced Oklahoma State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're familiar with Gene Stallings' coaching record, you weren't shocked 
that Alabama lost to Southern Mississippi. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Famous last words from CNN analyst Danny Sheridan Saturday morning just before 
the college football pregame show mercifully was pre-empted by a report from 
Helsinki: "BYU has absolutely no chance to beat Miami.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Ty Detmer is tough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Do you see the tape of the finish of that Utah-Minnesota game, won by the Utes 
on a 91-yard return of a blocked field goal? You won't see another quite like 
it again. . . . Sound-alikes: Mary Carillo and ESPN's Robin Roberts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Clippers should have drafted both Bo Kimble and Paul Westhead out of 
Loyola Marymount. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That new offensive coordinator has done wonders with Gabriela Sabatini's game. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Now tennis has the Wild Bull of the Sampras.

BLACK DAY TURNS DARK FOR OILERS, 47-27; 
</P>
<P>
FALCONS: GLANVILLE'S DEBUT IN ATLANTA ENDS UP AS A PRIME TIME RUNAWAY AGAINST 
HIS FORMER TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, the football coach who moved this year from the Houston Oilers 
to the Atlanta Falcons, is a master of the outrageous statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I only promise one thing: bodies will be flying all over the place," he said 
before Sunday's Falcon-Oiler game in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville also likes understatements. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never once told my guys that I used to coach the Oilers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, as they reminded him afterward, he didn't have to. They knew he wanted 
this one, and they gave it to him in a sizable way, swamping the Oilers, 47-27, 
when cornerback Deion (Prime Time) Sanders ran 82 yards to a touchdown with a 
last-minute interception. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's problem wasn't its new offense, the run-and-shoot. The Oilers' 
problem was as old as football. It was the old fumble play, which it executed 
four times in the first 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Falcons picked up the ball and scored with it. Twice, they used 
fumbles to set up a touchdown and a field goal. And in no time, Atlanta had a 
24-0 lead, leaving nothing much for anyone to stick around for but the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
When the Oilers settled down, they produced four touchdowns with their new 
offense -- all on passes by Warren Moon, who had a 389-yard day throwing the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
But this game wasn't a test of the run-and-shoot, or Atlanta's defense, or its 
offense or much of anything else. It was an exhibition of how to win a pro game 
with 301 net yards -- on a day when the other side gains 418 -- by cashing in 
on fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who you play, when you give up the ball that many times, 
that fast, you lose," said Oiler Coach Jack Pardee, who at the University of 
Houston last year coached an errorless run-and-shoot team that won a 95-21 game 
from SMU. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville used his postgame news conference as a platform from which to 
embarrass Pardee, his Oiler successor, for running up the score against SMU. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sending the game ball to (SMU Coach) Forrest Gregg," Glanville shouted, 
referring to the cross-town friend of his Houston days. 
</P>
<P>
And with that, he jumped down from the stage, declining to answer questions 
from anybody in the roomful of reporters, most of whom were on deadline. 
</P>
<P>
So after antagonizing most of the Texas press during his years with the Oilers, 
Glanville, starting fresh in a new environment, didn't make many friends on 
opening day -- except among fans of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they played in this stadium, last December, the Falcons drew 
7,792. 
</P>
<P>
For Glanville's first game here the crowd was a sellout 56,222, many dressed in 
Glanville's favorite color, black. 
</P>
<P>
His team was also in black shirts and black helmets, and even the ball boys, 
trainers and doctors wore all black. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if 15 or 20 Glanvilles were running around on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, his team played pretty well. With Chris Miller at quarterback, the 
Falcons were off to a 27-7 halftime lead, and Miller sustained his first drive 
of the third quarter for 70 yards and a 34-7 bulge that put Houston too far in 
arrears to think of coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, Moon outscored Miller, although it didn't much matter in a game 
that dragged on for 3:40 -- about an hour longer than the average exhibition 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville's stars, besides Miller, were linebacker Aundray Bruce and rookie 
halfback Steve Broussard, who made the timeliest of Atlanta's big plays. 
</P>
<P>
As the game began, Bruce sacked or hurried Moon repeatedly because the Oilers 
weren't expecting to see him in their backfield. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a bust in Atlanta ever since the club drafted him first three years 
ago. It turns out that that was because the former coaching staff wanted him in 
a disciplined defense. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wanted to play all-out, rush-the-passer defense. And as it happens, 
that's Glanville's way, too. 
</P>
<P>
It took 10 or 12 minutes for the Oilers to account for him, and by that time 
the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Houston fumbled on each of its four possessions of the first quarter and Bruce 
caused one when he sacked Moon at the Oiler 10-yard line, cornerback Bobby 
Butler recovering for Atlanta in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' other fumbles came after a 14-yard run with pass reception by 
halfback Lorenzo White, after a short option run by Moon and after a running 
play by White. 
</P>
<P>
On the option play, Moon didn't exactly fumble. He was on the stadium floor 
when Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle reached down, took the ball away, turned 
and loafed 65 yards to a touchdown. 
</P>

Most of the players on both sides were under the impression that the ball was 
dead after each of Moon's fumbles. Touchdown-makers Butler and Tuggle proceeded 
to 14 easy points for Glanville, who has put the fun back in football for the 
Falcons.

<P>
The Minnesota Vikings went for the fake and Steve DeBerg didn't blame them. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg, utilizing play-action fakes to 260-pound fullback Christian Okoye, 
drove the Kansas City Chiefs 78 yards to a touchdown with 9:35 left Sunday and 
beat the Vikings, 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't breakdowns by the defense," DeBerg said. "When we play-action fake, 
usually a team does get a little out of whack. They're trying to stop Christian 
Okoye with all the guys they can, and all of a sudden I have the ball going the 
other way. That is a tremendous burden for any defense." 
</P>
<P>
Okoye scored the go-ahead touchdown on a run from two yards out. On the winning 
drive, DeBerg found Bill Jones all alone for a 16-yard gain and connected with 
Rob Thomas, also uncovered, for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Both plays came after fakes to Okoye, who set up the score with an 11-yard run 
around left end. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do a good job of stopping the play-action pass," Minnesota Coach 
Jerry Burns said. "We practiced against that bootleg, but we didn't stop it 
very well. We didn't cover their receivers." 
</P>
<P>
After Okoye's go-ahead touchdown, the Vikings failed on a fourth and two with 
2:14 left, and the Chiefs ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Practically given two touchdowns in the first quarter, the Chiefs had to rally 
after Minnesota took a 21-17 lead when Wade Wilson flipped a six-yard scoring 
pass to Herschel Walker in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg completed 16 of 28 passes for 196 yards and two touchdowns, but didn't 
want any credit. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter after recovering fumbles by 
Wilson and Herschel Walker deep in Viking territory. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Jones and a 22-yarder to Rob McNair. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson rallied the Vikings with three touchdown passes, two of them six-yarders 
to Walker, and a 26-yarder to Steve Jordan. The first two tied the score, 
14-14, and the third, after Kansas City's Nick Lowery kicked a 43-yard field 
goal, gave Minnesota a 21-17 lead.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: DICKERSON FUELS ALL SORTS OF NEWS IN BATTLE OF THE 
OPENING DAY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ESPN "SportsCenter" anchor Robin Roberts no doubt was overstating things when, 
at 8:59 a.m. Sunday, she said, "And now the moment you've all been waiting for 
-- the premier of 'NFL GameDay.' " 
</P>
<P>
But on the day ESPN went head-to-head with NBC and CBS in the battle of NFL 
pregame shows, ESPN came out the winner, and not just because it had Brent 
Musburger. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's one-hour show is twice as long as the other two shows, and while not 
really twice as good, it was the best on the opening day of the NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, vastly improved, was a close second, and CBS, despite an impressive new 
set and an all-new cast, was a disappointing third. 
</P>
<P>
"GameDay" came on at 9 a.m., a half-hour later than in its five previous 
seasons, with a dynamite opening -- the lurking ghost of Musburger saying, 
"Now, you are looking live at 'GameDay's' war room!" 
</P>
<P>
Host Chris Berman said: "I think Rod Serling has entered the building." 
</P>
<P>
Berman, maybe realizing the Helsinki summit had knocked CNN's new 8:30 a.m. NFL 
pregame show off the air, said: "Here, up until kickoff, it's football that 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like getting your priorities in order. 
</P>
<P>
Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports executive producer, said the other day that his 
network's half-hour show would be faster-paced than ESPN's, but nobody can 
accuse Berman of being slow. If anything, he talks too fast. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, "GameDay," with its one-hour format, is just more complete than 
the half-hour 9:30 a.m. shows. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Theismann's interview with Joe Montana on "GameDay" went in depth, as 
Montana talked about his insecurities. He told Theismann that his fear of 
losing his job makes him work so hard. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS, Jim Gray had an interesting and revealing interview with Eric 
Dickerson, but it was cut too short. The viewers were left wanting more. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Dickerson, who is this Fred ("My Sources Tell Me") Edelstein on 
ESPN? Apparently, he edits some sort of newsletter nobody has heard of. 
</P>
<P>
Edelstein, who rarely attributes his reports to named sources, is the guy who 
said the Raiders would be playing the Denver Broncos in Oakland Sunday. So that 
tells you something about his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Edelstein said Dickerson refused to take a second physical with 
Indianapolis to force a trade to Atlanta, mentioning three Falcons the Colts 
wanted -- John Settle, Shawn Collins and Chris Hinton. Fine, but how does he 
know? 
</P>
<P>
On CBS, Dickerson told Gray that he passed his first physical, and for the 
Colts to say otherwise is a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson also told Gray he has apologized to teammates for some of his 
critical remarks and that, while he is no angel in this whole thing, he simply 
becomes frustrated and angry about losing. 
</P>
<P>
All three shows reported that Dickerson will meet with Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue on Sept. 17 to sort out the whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason the NBC show, "NFL Live," is so improved is the addition of 
Will McDonough, who spent the past four seasons at CBS. Also, NBC has given 
McDonough a more expanded role than he had at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough was able to address several important issues. He said four big-name 
coaches -- Mike Ditka, Bill Parcells, Joe Gibbs and Buddy Ryan -- are probably 
in their final seasons. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough also dealt with the scrambling issue -- the one regarding TV signals, 
not quarterbacks -- in a concise and clear manner. He said there will be no 
scrambling this season, and when there is next season, games will be made 
available to home satellite dish owners and sports bars for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough was one several good things about NBC's show. O.J. Simpson's feature 
on Ditka was excellent, and Simpson overall appeared more relaxed and 
comfortable than a year ago. And Bob Costas was his usual masterful self. 
</P>
<P>
He offered a concise and clear report on the Raider situation. He said a 
decision on the team's move would be made Tuesday or, at the latest, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If Al Davis is unable to reach an agreement with Oakland or Los Angeles, he 
will simply play out his lease with the Coliseum, meaning the Raiders will be 
the L.A. Raiders for two more years," Costas said. 
</P>
<P>
Costas told viewers he had just talked with Davis on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers are left wondering who ESPN's Edelstein talks to. He's the weak link in 
an otherwise fine show. 
</P>
<P>
As for CBS' "NFL Today," it was too predictable and too bland. 
</P>
<P>
Pat O'Brien's report on the Minnesota Vikings' retreat was good, but Lesley 
Visser's report on new rules to shorten games was unnecessary. They've been 
well publicized. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest improvement is Terry Bradshaw -- instead of Dick Butkus and Irv 
Cross -- as the resident ex-jock. He's animated and funny, which can't be said 
about new host Greg Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
Greg is no Bryant, at least not yet, although his general likability plays in 
his favor. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, it appears, misses Musburger. Where's Brent when you need him? Oh, that's 
right, over at ESPN, saying such things as "I'm just here to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.

For the record: It was incorrectly reported in Monday's editions that NBC's 
Will McDonough thinks Buddy Ryan is among several NFL coaches who won't be back 
next season. There is speculation that Ryan, who is in the final year of a 
five-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, might not be back, but 
McDonough doesn't agree. He said on "NFL Live" last Sunday that he believes 
Ryan will be re-signed sometime during the season.

GIANTS END LOSING STREAK AGAINST EAGLES; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: SIMMS MAKES BIG PLAYS IN SECOND HALF, LEADS TEAM TO FIRST WIN IN LAST FIVE 
GAMES AGAINST PHILADELPHIA.

<P>
The New York Giants finally found a way to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
They played just like the Eagles usually do against them and made the big 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms threw a 12-yard touchdown pass and Dave Meggett scored on a 68-yard 
punt return in a 1:56 span early in the third quarter to lead the Giants to a 
27-20 victory Sunday at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended the Eagles' four-game, two-season winning streak against the 
Giants, a span during which the Eagles always found a way to win and the Giants 
a way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just nice to beat these guys, nice to win," said Simms, who completed 7 
of 10 passes in the second half for 112 yards and two touchdowns. "Now we won't 
have to listen to all that stuff. It won't be hanging over our heads any more." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia had a 10-6 lead at halftime even though the Giants had more 
scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
But Simms, who finished 15 for 27 for 149 yards, sandwiched scoring passes of 
12 yards to rookie Rodney Hampton and 41 yards to Mark Ingram around Meggett's 
dazzling punt return in the first 17 minutes of the half, giving the Giants a 
27-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham, who was sacked four times and harassed 
throughout the game, completed 25 of 42 passes for 226 yards and was 
intercepted three times. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor sacked Cunningham three times and also forced a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with what I did, considering I just came into camp on 
Wednesday," Taylor said. "My stamina wasn't good. If it was, I would have made 
a couple more tackles." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were ahead, 13-10, when Hampton put the game away by taking a swing 
pass from Simms and running the final 10 yards, entering the end zone with a 
dive from the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett's return began when he fielded Jeff Feagles' punt at the Giants' 32, 
moved a couple of steps to his right and then cut through a tiny hole and 
scored after eluding Feagles at the 20.

Anthony Blaylock had a dream, then played it out. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock returned a fumble 30 yards for the only touchdown Sunday as the 
Cleveland Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, I dreamed about this last night," Blaylock said. "I dreamed 
I was going to make some kind of big play today. I had flashes of running 
something in -- I didn't know if it'd be an interception or what. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big situation for me, coming in to start. All last night I tossed and 
turned. I said I wasn't going to put pressure on myself like I did last year. I 
was going to relax and play my type of ball and whatever happens, happens." 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock was filling in for holdout Frank Minnifield, a Pro Bowl cornerback who 
is seeking a $1 million annual deal. Blaylock saw considerable playing time 
filling in for injured defensive backs last year, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
He nearly recovered a fumble deep in Pittsburgh territory in the first half, 
but his legs were out of bounds when he grabbed the ball, nullifying the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
His second chance was much easier. Merril Hoge's fumble bounced right into his 
hands, and Blaylock had a clear path to the end zone for his first career 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball popped out and it just bounced right to me," he said. "I just said, 
'Oh, thank God, thank God.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, defending champions in the AFC Central Division, won a 
season-opening game at home for the first time since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams struggled in their first games under new offensive coordinators, Joe 
Walton at Pittsburgh and Jim Shofner at Cleveland. The Steelers outgained the 
Browns, 210 yards to 158. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Jerry Kauric, who beat out Matt Bahr for the kicking job after Bahr 
hurt his back in the exhibition season, kicked field goals of 28 and 47 yards, 
and Gary Anderson kicked a 19-yarder for Pittsburgh.

DILWEG MAKES THE MOST OF HIS TURN IN SUN; 
</P>
<P>
PACKERS: MAJKOWSKI WATCHES WHILE HIS BACKUP OUTPLAYS EVERETT AND RAMS IN GREEN 
BAY'S VICTORY. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the Gentleman's Quarterly cover boy. And tell the Pro Bowl player with 
the $1.5-million contract to move over. Anthony Dilweg took over center stage 
Sunday at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
Ram quarterback Jim Everett, the magazine model, stumbled to an uneven 
performance and Green Bay's Don Majkowski was pushed aside by the throng of 
reporters surrounding Dilweg after the Packers' $195,000-a-year backup led 
Green Bay to a 36-24 season-opening victory over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg, who completed 20 of 32 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns, was 
saying that he thought his patience in the pocket was the key to his success 
when Majkowski yelled, "Well, I'm not very patient, Dilweg, and I want to get 
to my locker." 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg smiled and countered with, "I went through that a lot last year, Don. 
Now it's my turn." 
</P>
<P>
He spent a lot of time squeezing by a mass of media to change his clothes in 
1989 after Majkowski's repeated last-minute heroics hurled him to legendary 
status in this part of the country and earned him the title "Majic Man." But 
Majkowski's absence during training camp -- he held out for 45 days in a 
contract dispute -- gave Dilweg a chance to pull the starting job out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday, he made the most of that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Majkowski was activated Saturday and in uniform Sunday, standing 
on the sidelines if Dilweg faltered. Most thought it would only be a question 
of when, but Dilweg stood and delivered, and the Packers picked up their first 
opening-day victory in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Dilweg played very well, very much within himself," Packer Coach Lindy Infante 
said. "He was very solid. There were no interceptions, and I don't even 
remember a ball that was thrown that I would question." 
</P>
<P>
Infante said earlier in the week that he wasn't the type to try and fix 
something that wasn't broken, maintaining that Dilweg could keep his starting 
job if "Anthony goes out there and plays really well, we win the game and we 
can attribute some of the success to what Anthony does." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, however, the Packer coach skirted the issue of who would 
start next week. Direct questions elicited only indirect replies. 
</P>
<P>
"If you thought I was out there for three hours trying to think what I was 
going to do with the quarterback next week, well, I'm sure you're brighter than 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg, who tied for the highest IQ of draft eligible quarterbacks in 1989 
after ranking second in the nation in total offense during his senior year at 
Duke, is smart enough not to make any demands. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the coach's decision," he said. "My job was to make that decision as 
hard as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg certainly accomplished that much. He made the routine plays as well as 
the big plays and kept several drives alive with a combination of quick feet, a 
quick delivery and quick thinking. 
</P>
<P>
He completed his first two passes and then sprinted 16 yards on a quarterback 
draw on a third-and-five play near midfield. Dilweg rushed five times for 24 
yards overall. 
</P>
<P>
After safety Mark Murphy intercepted Everett's pass and returned it to the Ram 
four-yard line, Dilweg found tight end Ed West in the end zone for a touchdown 
on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
He completed four of six passes on the Packers' next possession -- including a 
50-yarder to West -- as Green Bay drove 57 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Chris 
Jacke's 26-yard field goal. And he accounted for all of the yardage in a 
two-play, 62-yard drive that ended with a 47-yard touchdown pass to wide 
receiver Jeff Query that lifted the Packers to a 17-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Just like that, Dilweg had completed 13 of 18 first-half passes and eliminated 
any temptation by the coaches -- or even the fans -- to call for Majkowski. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't quite as effective in the second half, but Dilweg continued to make 
almost all the right moves as the Packers took advantage of the Rams' inability 
to hang onto the football. In the fourth quarter, he orchestrated an 80-yard 
scoring drive and hooked up with West again on a seven-yard touchdown pass that 
put the Rams down, 27-17, with 11:49 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Even Majkowski seemed genuinely impressed. "I'm happy for him," he said. "This 
means a lot for the team, right now because this was a big game and down the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, after their final exhibition game, the road ahead of the 
Packers appeared to be littered with potholes. Trouble loomed as Dilweg threw 
four interceptions and fumbled four times during a 27-14 loss to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to learn what I could from that experience and then put it behind 
me," he said. "Today, I wanted to concentrate on staying focused, not making 
bad decisions or throwing bad passes. I just wanted to stay consistent with my 
reads and assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Dilweg, who got into only two plays as a rookie last year, a jolly 
good time was had by all in green and gold on this Sunday.

This Division I stuff may not be so tough after all. One day after finishing 
fifth in a 16-team tournament at Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Northridge 
swept Oklahoma on Sunday at Matador Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN showed no signs of fatigue in its home opener, winning 15-7, 15-8, 15-8 in 
its sixth match in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma (2-4) took early leads in the first two games, but each time middle 
hitter Kathleen Dixon put the Matadors ahead with well-placed dinks and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Nicholls contributed in the second half of the second game with six 
powerful kills. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (7-3) controlled the third game from the start. An ace by Nicholls, 
a Dixon-Fitzsimmons block, a Dixon kill and two kills by reserve Jill Trehearne 
contributed to an 8-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners responded with a series of kills and an ace to pull within 9-7, but 
CSUN closed the door for a 15-8 final capped by Shelly Swalec's ace. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon finished with 10 kills, five blocks and two service aces and setter Beth 
Welch had 30 assists, a team-high 12 digs and five kills. 
</P>

A'S COMPLETE SWEEP OF YANKEES

<P>
It may be some consolation for the New York Yankees to know that the team that 
swept them this season isn't an ordinary club. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee tripled home two runs with two out in the ninth inning to break a 
tie and the Oakland Athletics beat the Yankees, 7-3, Sunday at New York to 
finish 12-0 against them for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart (19-10) gave up nine hits but only two earned runs in eight 
innings to close in on his fourth consecutive 20-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
The A's, who outscored the Yankees, 62-12, in the 12 games, extended their lead 
to 9 1/2 games in the American League West with only 24 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, acquired to play center field when Dave Henderson was injured and lost 
for the season, drove in four runs. After a slow start with the A's, McGee has 
five hits in his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire hit his 36th home run and also had a two-run single to climax the 
four-run ninth, giving him 99 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The A's became the fourth team to sweep a season series, all since the 
expansion to 14 teams and 11 and 12-game series. Baltimore did it in 1978 
against Oakland and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"As a team, it's been a tremendous accomplishment," former Yankee co-captain 
Willie Randolph said. "Obviously, we had their number. We just did the right 
things at the right time. Each game is different. We just matched our pitching 
in each game." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson, the offensive catalyst for the A's, is another former Yankee 
who enjoyed the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yankees are a team you like to get up for because when you were a kid you 
heard about them," Henderson said. "The Yankees may be last, but they are a 
good team. They have a bunch of youngsters who have to prove themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Chicago 1 -- The one constant this season in Toronto has been the 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
As the Blue Jays moved back into the race in the East, they drew 49,870 fans to 
the Skydome to break their own league attendance record. They have drawn 
3,386,385 and have 10 more home games. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff and Greg Myers hit consecutive home runs in a four-run sixth 
inning that pulled the Blue Jays to within 4 1/2 games of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping White Sox made four errors and lost their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Key (10-7) gave up six hits and an unearned run in seven innings to pitch 
the Blue Jays to their fourth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We dug ourselves into this hole," McGriff said after hitting his 33rd home 
run. "I just hope there's time to dig out." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Boston 1 -- The Red Sox found a temporary replacement for ailing 
Roger Clemens, but the Mariners' Matt Young spoiled the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hesketh, making his first start in four years, gave up three runs, two of 
them earned, and struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Young (8-14), working out of two bases-loaded jams, pitched seven strong 
innings and the Mariners handed the Red Sox just their fourth loss in the last 
16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Young had four strikeouts in the first inning, but one of them, Wade Boggs, 
reached first on a passed ball. Boggs has only two hits in 24 at-bats against 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Hesketh was released by Montreal and Atlanta this season before signing with 
the Red Sox as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exciting," Hesketh said. "I didn't feel strange, in fact I felt great. 
I'm just sorry we didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Kansas City 5 -- Steve Farr walked Pete Incaviglia with two out and 
the bases loaded in the ninth inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in as many games that the Rangers beat the Royals in the 
bottom of the ninth, and both times Julio Franco scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
About all that is left of the Royals' season is to find out if George Brett 
will win another batting title. Brett had two hits in four at-bats and drove in 
four runs. He was seven for 15 in the series to raise his average to .323. 
Rickey Henderson leads at .324. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, Milwaukee 0 -- Scott Aldred, who was 6-15 with an earned-run average 
of 4.90 for triple-A Toledo, found the American League easier in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
Aldred, despite walking five in five innings, yielded just four hits to win his 
first start. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Travis Fryman hit his seventh home run and went six for 12 in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 12, Minnesota 9 -- The Indians took out some of the anger of their 
second-half collapse with a seven-run seventh at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the seventh, the Indians were trailing Mark Guthrie, 5-1. Candy 
Maldonado's two-out, two-run double put the Indians ahead to stay. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EXPOS KEEP PRESSURE ON THE PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Montreal Expos never quite climbed into the pennant race in the National 
League East, but they are doing their best to determine who wins it. 
</P>
<P>
They've already prevented the Pittsburgh Pirates from running away with the 
title. And they still have six games left with the second-place New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they lost starting pitcher Dennis Martinez in the first inning 
Sunday at Pittsburgh, the Expos continued their success against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was knocked out when a line drive by leadoff batter Wally Backman hit 
him in the collarbone. Although he scrambled to get the ball and threw Backman 
out, Martinez couldn't continue. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga and Mike Fitzgerald hit home runs to lead a 15-hit attack and 
the Expos defeated the Pirates, 9-5. By winning two of the three games in the 
series, the Expos kept the Pirates from extending their 3 1/2-game lead over 
the struggling Mets. 
</P>
<P>
For the season, the Expos, who won six of nine at Pittsburgh, are 10-5 against 
the Pirates. They play three more at Montreal next weekend. The problem is that 
the Expos, in third place, are 7 1/2 games behind the Pirates with 24 games to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is 2-1 with a 1.69 earned-run average against Pittsburgh. Manager Bob 
Rodgers juggled his bullpen until a four-run ninth broke the game open. Mel 
Rojas (2-1) followed Martinez, giving up one run in 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have the teams in front of us fall flat on their face to win it," 
Rodgers said. "Our bullpen has done the job against the Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos built a 4-0 lead and had to survive home runs by Barry Bonds and Jeff 
King. Bonds hit his career-high 26th. King hit a two-run homer in the fifth. 
King has 13 home runs and seven of his last 15 hits have been home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, New York 2 -- After another disastrous trip, the Mets return 
home for the next 10 games. With the best home record (46-22) in the majors, 
they expect to pull back into race in the East. 
</P>
<P>
But they'll probably be facing mostly left-handers the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
When Pat Combs held them to five hits in seven innings at Philadelphia, it was 
the seventh time in their last eight games against left-handers that they've 
lost. It also gave them a 2-6 record on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Magadan, who hit a two-run homer in the top of the seventh to give the 
Mets a 2-1 lead, put it succinctly. "We stink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Fernandez (9-12) held the Phillies to four hits in six innings, but they 
got three consecutive singles in the seventh to tie it. With one out, Dickie 
Thon doubled in the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Mets' most productive hitters are in slumps. Darryl Strawberry had 
two hits, but he has just four hits in his last 24 at-bats. Howard Johnson has 
two hits in his last 24 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about the Pirates," Strawberry said. "We have to worry about 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets are 32-39 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Manager Bud Harrelson said. "We at least wanted to go home with a 
win." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Houston 1 -- Giants' Manager Roger Craig almost gave slumping 
Kevin Mitchell the day off at San Francisco. It's a good thing he changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who was hitless in his last 17 at-bats, had a run-scoring single in 
the first inning, and with two out and one on in the sixth, he hit his 33rd 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's hitting helped Mike LaCoss (6-3), who gave up seven hits in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Atlanta 4 -- With one out in the 11th inning at San Diego, Garry 
Templeton hit a sharp grounder to first and Tommy Gregg's throw home was too 
late to get pinch-runner Phil Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show (5-8), pitched two scoreless innings to get the victory. Show has now 
gone 15 1/3 consecutive innings without giving up a run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 9, Chicago 2 -- Rookie center fielder Ray Lankford had four hits, 
drove in two runs and scored twice in the first Sunday night game at Wrigley 
Field to lead the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>

Izvestia, ridden by Don Seymour, beat Baron de Vauz by 3 1/2 lengths to win the 
Molson Million at Woodbine Sunday and became Canada's leading money-winning 
thoroughbred. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old gray colt, winner of Canada's triple crown this year, won 
$600,000 and increased his earnings to $2,368,047. Izvestia's stablemate, 1989 
Canadian triple crown winner With Approval, had been the leader with 
$2,341,540. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia stalked the leaders down the backstretch, then burst to the front on 
the far turn for his ninth victory in 11 career starts. He went 1 1/4 miles in 
2:01 3/5.

BATTLE LINES FORM OVER RIVER VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY IS SEEN AS A RICH RIPARIAN HABITAT BY SOME, A 
LITTER-STREWN SWAMP BY OTHERS. BUT A STRONG MOVE IS AFOOT TO TURN 2,900 ACRES 
INTO A REGIONAL PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Ysidro businessman Joseph Garcia looks at the 40 acres he leases in the 
Tijuana River Valley and sees a litter-strewn, sewage-swamped breeding ground 
for mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and government officials cast their gaze over the same landscape and 
see an environmentally sensitive area battling for its life, a place that some 
call the richest riparian habitat in the southwestern United States. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, those officials have told Garcia they want him to see things their way 
-- or else. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of county, state and federal agencies have targeted Garcia and his 
landlord, Nelson &amp; Sloan sand mining company, because their activities are 
believed to threaten two obscure man-made ponds that are nesting sites for an 
endangered bird, the least Bell's vireo. 
</P>
<P>
These officials, some who eventually hope to transform the ponds and the 
surrounding land into a 2,900-acre regional park, say Garcia has shown blatant 
disregard for the wetland area by illegally grading and building a parking lot 
about a mile from the ponds. And they are threatening to take legal action to 
keep him and his landlord, who is mining in the area, from grading in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
But Garcia, who runs an international trade center on his landlord's property 
in San Ysidro, says he is being singled out unfairly. In contrast to the many 
people who use the estuary as a dump, he says he has tried to improve his 
parcel -- despite the confusing, and sometimes conflicting, advice he has 
received from competing bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told by the city (San Diego) to clean up my property and proceeded to do 
that. Then the state Fish and Game Department came by and stopped me from 
picking up the trash," he said. "Have they seen the ponds and the area around 
them lately? People dump oil and other trash in them . . . . There are dirt 
roads leading to the ponds that are heavily traveled by people who aren't 
suppose(d) to be there. Nobody bothers to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
Regulatory officials admit there is some confusion over who is responsible for 
the ponds. Owned by the state but managed by the county, the ponds have 
attracted a tangle of advocates from various bureaucracies, from the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, to the state Fish and Game Department to the County Parks 
and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
They also admit that Garcia's allegedly illegal grading and leveling is just 
one of many problems that plague the area. Rene Langis,a researcher with the 
Pacific Estuarine Research Laboratory, which studies the Tijuana River Valley, 
said that sewage contamination and mounds of trash are threatening the delicate 
balance of what he calls one of the most ecologically sensitive salt marsh 
areas in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The main problem is the sewage inflow, which is diluting the salinity of the 
marsh," said Langis, noting that raw sewage from Tijuana flows directly into 
the Tijuana River, which follows a course just north of the U.S.-Mexican border 
and empties into the Pacific Ocean below Imperial Beach. And then there's the 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's stuff coming in with the tide and a lot of trash that's dropped there 
by people. There's a lot of people walking across the valley and their trash is 
having a damaging effect," Langis said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials see Garcia and his landlords as a significant threat to the 
environment in the area. And they intend to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing a cease-and-desist order against 
Nelson &amp; Sloan, said Corps spokeswoman Mary O'Keefe, that would halt the 
grading and filling of the wetlands, which the company is allegedly doing 
without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Keefe and Ann Rast, chief of special operations for the County 
Parks and Recreation Department, Nelson &amp; Sloan has been violating the 
federal Clean Water Act by destroying the habitat in and around the ponds. The 
order does not mention Garcia, since he is a tenant on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Gabler, a state Fish &amp; Game Department warden, said that the company 
is also suspected of dumping fill dirt in the surrounding wetlands, but both 
Gabler and Rast said their agencies are still investigating those alleged 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson &amp; Sloan officials declined several requests for interviews and did 
not return phone calls. But last month, company general manager Ken Monson told 
the San Diego Tribune that the only grading done by his company was in sand 
pits and areas where the city had issued orders to clean up the property. 
</P>
<P>
That explanation echoes Garcia's concerns and part of the problem seems to be 
that the company, Garcia and city and county officials all seem to mean 
different things when they refer to "cleaning up" the property. When Garcia was 
reprimanded by the Fish and Game Department last month, for example, he told 
them he was only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being given different instructions by the state and the city," Garcia 
complained. "They (state) told me to stop the cleaning, but I have an order 
from the fire marshal and the city to clean up the place." 
</P>
<P>
According to Garcia, he has already spent $100,000 to clean up the property and 
an additional $20,000 to fence part of it to keep out dirt-bike riders. He 
denied leveling the property but admitted covering six acres with eight inches 
of compacted dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the city before I covered it with dirt. I told them what I wanted 
to do and they told me I didn't need a permit. I've got the paperwork in my 
office if anybody wants to see it," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabler, the state warden, acknowledged that Garcia has been ordered by several 
city agencies to clean up debris littered over the 40 acres he leases. However, 
Gabler charged that Garcia has gone beyond just tidying up the area and has 
illegally bulldozed and graded the property without the necessary permits. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pick up debris, level the area and put on top soil for a parking lot, 
it's a different thing as far as we're concerned," said Gabler. "We've told him 
that we don't mind if he cleans up the property, we just don't want him 
illegally dozing and grading. This poses a great danger to our ponds." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem with the pond-saving effort is that much of the area 
involved simply doesn't look worth saving, making it doubly difficult to 
persuade people who use it to be careful. Home to migratory birds such as ducks 
and egrets, it is an invaluable environmental resource, Rast said -- but Garcia 
says it looks like a dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the Fish and Game Department's position and concern for the 
wildlife," Garcia said. "But the ponds are about a mile away from us. There is 
wildlife out there, but most of the wildlife is mosquitoes." 
</P>
<P>
Gabler acknowledged that the poorly maintained and patrolled area "is not the 
prettiest picture in the world." In addition to being heavily traversed by 
illegal aliens on their trek northward and pursuing Border Patrol vehicles, the 
river valley is also littered with every imaginable piece of garbage -- from 
abandoned cars to rusting refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
Gabler blamed the "shortage of personnel at every level" for the failure to 
detect the alleged violations earlier. And until recently, communication 
between city and county agencies has been anything but clear, said Rast. 
</P>
<P>
"That's changing," she said. "We're attempting to develop a better 
communication with the city to see how we can handle violations and see what we 
can do. But we can only prosecute people who dump on or destroy county land." 
</P>
<P>
If the dream of a regional park is ever to become real, Rast said, "we have to 
take a leap of faith that in the future we can . . . be able to restore the 
land." Currently, the county only owns about one-fifth of the land proposed for 
the park, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While it may not seem fair to Garcia that the crackdown begins with him, 
officials say they have to start somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be there and cite people every time they dump stuff in the ponds, 
but I can't," Gabler said. "But we've begun an aggressive enforcement program 
and we are going to save those ponds from further destruction." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a long time to iron out this mess," she said. "(But) it's 
got to be done for species like the least Bell's vireo. You just can't take a 
species and place it somewhere else."

STREET SMART: EVEN IN IRVINE, A TRAFFIC OFFENDER MIGHT GET A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I was recently handed a traffic citation by an Irvine motorcycle officer who 
advised me that any discussion was pointless because Irvine has a "100% 
enforcement" policy on traffic violations. I have heard of "zero tolerance" for 
drug offenses, but traffic tickets? 
</P>
<P>
C'mon Irvine, give us a break!! 
</P>
<P>
Bob David 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Unless federal drug czar William Bennett has grown a mustache, donned leather 
boots and become an Irvine motorcycle cop, there seems to be a bit of confusion 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police officials say they don't have a "100% enforcement" policy on 
traffic violations. In fact, the city's police write tickets on average only 
about one out of every two times they stop a motorist, according to 
Investigator Doug Coffing of the police traffic division. The other times 
verbal warnings are administered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 100% by any means and there's no policy," Coffing said. "Obviously 
there was a miscommunication between this motorist and the officer." 
</P>
<P>
Coffing noted, however, that members of the department's motorcycle traffic 
team are typically a bit stricter than regular patrol officers, writing tickets 
about 70% of the time they pull someone over. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the people who work traffic are more apt to write you up 
because "that is their function" and they are "a little more attuned" to 
traffic laws. Moreover, the traffic officers have to clean up after car 
accidents much more frequently, providing a constant reinforcement of the 
consequences that can result from poor driving. 
</P>
<P>
Any officer who suggests that the Irvine police have an unyielding policy on 
issuing traffic tickets is twisting the facts. If you wish to press the issue 
with the department, I would suggest taking the matter up with the officer's 
supervisor and, if necessary, the internal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I thought those halogen headlamps were illegal on cars. When are they 
necessary? Certainly not on city streets or freeways. They are blinding, 
whether behind you or coming toward you. They are worse than regular headlights 
on high beam. 
</P>
<P>
I find them especially bad on a freeway that curves, sending the beams of light 
directly into the eyes of an oncoming driver. Driving crowded freeways is tough 
enough without being blinded, from either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I do change lanes whenever possible, but it is not always possible. Even 
changing the rear-view mirror to dim does not alter the blinding. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Jackson 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
Halogen headlights are perfectly legal and are standard equipment on many cars 
on the road today. But you are right about the blinding effects of these 
ultra-bright lamps. 
</P>
<P>
They are perhaps most disconcerting on very tall vehicles such as jacked-up 
pickup trucks. When one of these guys pulls up from behind, it's like the sun 
has come out inside the car. I end up doing all sorts of fancy gestures with my 
hands -- making silhouettes on the dashboard of dogs, cats, that sort of thing 
-- and they eventually get the picture and back off. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Milton, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, recommends that drivers bothered by headlights from an oncoming 
car focus their eyes on the right-hand edge of the road until it passes. 
</P>
<P>
If one looks directly into the beams, the pupils of the eyes will shut down and 
only open up slowly. Moreover, the ability to cope with the glare of headlights 
diminishes as one gets older, Milton said. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended that motorists never retaliate against drivers with their high 
beams on by putting their own high beams on. That can only create more 
problems. A brief click of the high beams is usually sufficient to remind an 
oncoming motorist that he needs to switch to low-beam headlights. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to do is never look directly into oncoming headlights," Milton 
said. "Don't let that glare take you straight in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
In car-crazy Southern California, there are few things that can set the pulse 
racing quite like the sight and sound of an old classic automobile. The region 
is home to some of the most serious collectors of antique cars in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of the largest classic car clubs in the state is gearing up for its 
annual fund-raising show. Great Autos of Yesteryear, a multimarque car club 
that was formed seven years ago in Yorba Linda and has grown to more than 700 
members, will display cars of all types at its third annual Concours d'Elegance 
next Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the show featured 126 classic collectible autos, and promoters 
expect even more oldies-but-goodies when the event kicks off at the Pacific 
Design Center in West Hollywood. The event, which drew 1,200 last year and 
featured a Ford Model A that was raffled off, is open to the public. Proceeds 
will go to Aid for AIDS, Los Angeles County's nonprofit agency making emergency 
cash grants to persons suffering from AIDS.

FOOTBALL OBSESSION MAKES LA JOLLAN A NATURAL TO TAKE ON NFL, NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider this: Norman Lebovitz, a stumpy La Jollan who made his mark in life 
selling hot dogs, is invited to New York City to talk about this "scrambling" 
problem with CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Call it "Mr. Sluggo's Goes to Manhattan," or maybe David versus Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
The networks wanted to scramble National Football League games starting Sunday. 
They sought to limit NFL watchers to those in the stands or to those who tune 
in only through network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling would cut out anyone watching on home or commercial satellite 
systems, which don't pick up local affiliates and thus fail to receive local 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
But what the powers failed to realize was Norman Lebovitz, and millions like 
him, don't much care for the "hometown" team. Lebovitz's team is the Chicago 
Bears -- not the San Diego Chargers -- even though he lives in La Jolla and has 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, he says, but America has changed. It is now a nation of nomads, and 
nowhere is that more evident than San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
So, he formed a grass-roots consumer effort called the Assn. for Sports Fans' 
Rights. He installed a toll-free number in his Sluggo's outlets in La Jolla and 
Hillcrest, and the phone lit up. He declared a national boycott of 
Anheuser-Busch Inc., the NFL's biggest sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting was arranged in New York between Lebovitz ("just the average fan") 
and executives of two major networks. Lebovitz made a point not to wear a coat 
or a tie. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never do," he said. "Why do you have to, if you're your own boss?" 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the meeting, Lebovitz was assured privately, as were 
officials for the breweries, that scrambling will not take place before the 
1991 season. He can still watch his Bears via satellite. He doesn't have to 
return to Chicago, and would have, he said, "If somehow, I can't whip this 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
A truce reached, he called off the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that David had whipped Goliath, but Lebovitz was not entirely 
happy with Sunday's telecasts, which he said were "closely monitored" 
nationwide, on the NFL's opening day. 
</P>
<P>
"Westar 5 (a satellite used by CBS) was totally scrambled (Sunday morning)," he 
said. "We were able to pick up all of the games on other satellites, such as 
Telstar 1 and Telstar 2, but CBS went out of its way to make things difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, they're playing a game with us. And I don't understand why . . 
. . But after talking to people around the country (Sunday), we've decided to 
guard ourselves against the lie. If CBS reneges on its word, we'll declare a 
total boycott of Busch, Miller and NFL Properties, then ask every sports fan in 
the country to turn off CBS. We'll go for the jugular." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz called last week's meeting 
</P>
<P>
with NBC cordial and open; his meeting with CBS, just the opposite, although 
both networks gave him what he wanted -- a promise for a freeze on scrambling 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He said the CBS executive, knowing that he loved the Bears, offered him an 
expensive, full-color book about the history of the franchise, which he 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take bribes," Lebovitz said. "Especially cheap ones." 
</P>
<P>
Who is Norman Lebovitz and what got him so mad? 
</P>
<P>
He's a 52-year-old native of Chicago's north side who moved to La Jolla in 1985 
because he was, in his wife's words, "burned out" and saw an "incredible 
business opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
He bought Sluggo's and made it a kind of Chicago West. In both outlets (he has 
a third at University Towne Centre), the walls are covered with Chicago 
memorabilia, most of it having to do with Bears, Cubs, Hawks or Bulls. And on 
the roof is the satellite dish, beaming in any Chicago event it can find. If 
one isn't available, Lebovitz said, he plays a tape -- on which the Windy City 
team always win. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets an idea in his head, he will follow through until the bitter 
end," said Richard Fuller, a fellow Chicagoan, who met Lebovitz after he moved 
here 5 1/2 years ago. "He tries to do the right thing, but he's a very tough 
guy. When he thinks he's right, somehow, he'll get the job done. He'll go the 
whole nine yards and then some. I wouldn't want him mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller was asked if his friend has a dark side. 
</P>
<P>
"He's overweight," he said with a laugh. "And, he's a tough businessman. He has 
a temper, he's human. He's not faultless." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said his views of the world were formed in part on the day he came 
home from school and found his mother writhing on the kitchen floor. He said it 
was around 1943, and he was in the first grade. His parents, Jewish immigrants 
from Czechoslovakia, had moved to the United States before he was born. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in a one-bedroom apartment above the boiler on Division Street in 
Chicago," he said. "My mother was rolling all over the place, screaming, 
crying. She was so hysterical she couldn't talk. Clutched in her hand was a 
telegram from the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't read then, but my aunt lived nearby, so I grabbed the telegram and 
ran down the street. It was the Red Cross notifying my mother that her mother, 
her father, her brothers and sisters -- her entire family and most of my 
extended family -- had been gassed by the Nazis at Buchenwald." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz sighed and said, "My daughter lived in Germany for two years, and I 
refused to visit her. I feel it would betray my parents for me to ever go to 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Lebovitz said, "I can't be pushed, I can't be pressured, and don't 
get me mad -- there are no limits to what I can do if I'm (angry)." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than shy from conflict, he says a part of him loves it, thrives on it. 
His friend Fuller says he's an emotional version of Dick Butkus, the great Bear 
linebacker who earned his team the nickname "Monsters of the Midway." 
</P>
<P>
"He's an up-front, no b.s., no-nonsense kind of guy," Fuller said. "But good, 
solid people, through and through." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said he once won a lawsuit against a Chicago company that tried to 
assess a rental fee during a price freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it as a cheap tactic and won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won another suit against a company that attempted to tear down one of his 
hot dog stands for a project it was building. And, he spent $40,000 in legal 
fees to win a La Jolla suit involving an air conditioner, in a dispute over a 
matter that was worth thousands less. 
</P>
<P>
"I was right," he said. "It was the principle of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
And so, it was the principle of the thing that led him to battle Goliath in the 
form of the NFL and the networks. Lebovitz said his most lasting memory of last 
week's New York experience was how fearful network executives are of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"It saddened me," he said. "If my customer comes in here and spends his good, 
hard-earned money, and he's scared of me, then something ain't right," Lebovitz 
said. "I should be scared of him, because he represents my livelihood. The 
power the NFL has is ridiculous. It's like they've made themselves bigger than 
the thing they're promoting." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Lebovitz loves professional football with a passion that is obsessive. 
Friend Fuller says: "He's a fanatic, absolutely crazy." Fuller said Lebovitz 
has a "healthy disrespect for authority" and an "unbridled love for the truth 
and the Chicago Bears." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sheila, to whom he's been married for 29 years, and with whom he 
shares three daughters and one grand-daughter, said that he was late to their 
wedding because he and his buddies hadn't gotten back from a Bears game at 
Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"In his heart," she said, "I'm not sure I come before the Bears or the Cubs or 
after both." 
</P>
<P>
She says Lebovitz developed an interest in sports as an outgrowth of the only 
social life he knew -- talking about baseball or football while greeting the 
public at work. She said Lebovitz's father was a "total illiterate," whose son 
went to work for him at age 6 so his dad "could make change." 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Lebovitz took his Bar Mitzvah money and opened his own hot-dog stand 
(Sammy's Red Hots, named after a cousin, who lost an arm in World War II), his 
wife said. The teen-aged provider kept putting food on the table, and, his wife 
said, "hasn't stopped providing for people ever since. He takes care of a lot 
of people. His Bar Mitzvah was more than just symbolic -- the boy did become a 
man, overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz does not have a "formal education," she added, "but is very smart and 
has terrific business sense. He's extremely good at what he does, and he's very 
caring. He often covers up for it with a gruff bravado, but he cares very 
deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Sammy's (and later additional franchises called Lemmy's) evolved into a chain 
of 34 that was sold for a tidy profit. He then retired "for a few months," and, 
based on a restless impulse, started his own pickle firm. He merged it with the 
Vienna Beef Co., which appointed him a top executive. He said he came to La 
Jolla to "trouble-shoot" for a problem client and ended up buying the man's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my wife and said, 'I'm not coming home,' " he said. "It was the first 
time I'd ever done anything like that. She said, 'You've got to come home, 
you've only got clothes for five days.' " 
</P>
<P>
He stayed. Two and a half years later, his wife joined him -- reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
She said the casualness of Southern California appeals to her husband, "who is 
basically withdrawn." An outgoing woman with a fine arts degree from a Chicago 
institution, she decorated the bright interiors of each Sluggo's. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I find is that people out here are so apathetic," she said. 
"They're so self-conscious that, at times, they don't seem to care about 
anything but themselves. I can't have a good political argument with anybody, 
because nobody cares enough or knows enough to get into one. And it's sad to me 
that people can live in a place for a lengthy time and never really know 
anybody. That's so foreign to me, coming from the Midwest, where just about 
everybody says, 'Hello, how are you?' 
</P>
<P>
"But Normie loves it here. Out here, he's Mr. Chicago, and he loves that. He 
fell in love with what he called his intriguing San Diego adventure. This was 
hot dog heaven -- virgin territory -- and he conquered it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Lebovitzes first met 39 years ago, the husband's work has always 
involved hot dogs. His wife says they lived next door to each other as "the 
best of friends" throughout adolescence. "One thing led to another," and they 
were married. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, he would go to school from 8 a.m. to noon, then go to work," 
she said. "He once worked 1,000 straight days -- I kid you not. On the night of 
our senior prom, he had to work. I never felt so sorry for him as I did that 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said the most his father ever made was $55 a week, sandpapering 
picture frames, so the son carried the burden. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever times got tough, and there were plenty of those, I couldn't just 
stand around," he said. "I didn't have no rich uncle to bail me out. I had to 
keep moving forward . . . or die." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz is convinced that he would not have been successful in any other 
country but this one. "That's why I drive an Oldsmobile and not a Toyota," he 
said. Early in the NFL controversy, he was quoted as saying, "I have a nephew 
on his way to Saudi Arabia to defend the networks' right to rob me of my 
livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
He agrees his drive to succeed, as well as his love for sports, borders on the 
maniacal, if not the bizarre. To unwind, he "visits the psychiatrist" once a 
week, the shrink being a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
He says he can't conceive of a life without sports, and as a result, the Assn. 
for Sports Fans' Rights, along with its toll-free number, will continue. He's 
hoping to take his fight to "the halls of Congress," where he says the NFL is 
vulnerable, especially on antitrust. He talks of organizing fans into a union, 
"except this union has the money -- we pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
About his energy, which one network executive labeled "amazing -- absolutely 
amazing," Lebovitz said, "What can I say? I'm crazy . . . . There's no other 
way to explain it."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come on In, the Mud and the Surfing Is Great 
</P>
<P>
I am in Temecula, six miles north of the San Diego-Riverside county line, to 
observe mud surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat: mud surfing, a mix of cowboy and cow-a-bunga. 
</P>
<P>
"We invented the sport here," explains Buck Kemmis, mud surfing chairman for 
this year's 14th annual Great Temecula Tractor Race. "So far, it hasn't caught 
on in the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to stay upright on a bale of hay towed by a tractor through a 
150-foot-long mud puddle. Then jump off and unload six more bales from a pickup 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a bash that includes mud bogging, barbecue, pig races, arm 
wrestling, country-Western music, a lizard show, kiddie carnival and elephant 
rides. It will be Oct. 5-7, but a preview was held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
These are pioneer folk. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, Temecula was just a hot, dry, sparsely populated stretch of 
land south of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's a growing city of 20,000 (with another 35,000 in the surrounding 
area), part of the great maw of subdivisions and shopping centers marching down 
Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
A year from now, the wide-open site of the Great Temecula Tractor Race is 
slated to be a business park. (One of several already built or being planned.) 
</P>
<P>
If the Great Temecula Tractor Race has a historical antecedent, it's probably 
the square dance in "Oklahoma," where ranchers and farmers try to put aside 
their economic and political differences. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's preview featured several grudge matches, including a tractor race 
between the mayors of Temecula and Lake Elsinore. The latter is sore because 
the new phone book left Lake Elsinore's name off the cover. 
</P>
<P>
If the preview is prologue, the Great Temecula Tractor Race will have a 
joyousness that may seem alien to San Diegans, accustomed as we are to 
endlessly dour debates about the evils of growth. 
</P>
<P>
Here, just a few miles from our border, lives a race of suburbanites who are in 
the midst of explosive growth and seem to be enjoying the heck out of it, 
mud-surfing and all. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics and Money 
</P>
<P>
Here's a small lesson in money and politics at San Diego City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Blair and Tom Carter are seeking reappointment to the board of the Centre 
City Development Corp., the City Council's redevelopment arm. 
</P>
<P>
Each is talking to council members. Each talked to Councilwoman Linda 
Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
The talk was of downtown issues: housing, hotels and the homeless. Bernhardt 
brought up another topic: her campaign debt. 
</P>
<P>
She asked both Carter and Blair to help her retire her $90,000 campaign debt. 
</P>
<P>
As she tries to whittle down the largest debt ever incurred by a San Diego 
council member, Bernhardt spends a lot of her time looking for money: 
</P>
<P>
"Probably three-quarters of the people I call (for fund-raising help) could 
appear before the City Council for a vote or could be coming to my office for 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Carter and Blair are among the city's best political fund-raisers. Blair, who 
owns an employment agency, raises money for Republicans; Carter, a financial 
consultant, raises mostly for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Each declined Bernhardt's request. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he's already helping statewide candidates. Blair said he lives in 
Scripps Ranch where anti-Bernhardt sentiment is high. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt said she's not decided whether to support Blair or Carter. She says 
their refusal to help her will not influence her decision. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, Blair and Carter all stress there was no specific hint of quid pro 
quo on Bernhardt's part. But Carter adds: 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of politics is a quid pro quo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's in a Word 
</P>
<P>
 Words, words, words. 
</P>
<P>
* Laying down on the job? 
</P>
<P>
Press release: "Mercy Hospital to Host Prostrate Screening." 
</P>
<P>
* Title of Kennita Watson's speech Tuesday to the San Diego Libertarian Supper 
Club: "Better Me Than Eu." 
</P>
<P>
It helps if you know Watson is running for secretary of state against March 
Fong Eu.

SANCTUARY'S ROLE IN ECONOMY STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fellowship recipient has begun a federally funded study to determine how much 
the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary contributes to the local economy 
through fishing, boating and other commercial activities. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong project will also recommend ways the sanctuary can increase its 
contribution through heavier uses that do not harm its environment. 
</P>
<P>
The project is supervised by Julie A. Reynolds, who received a California Sea 
Grant fellowship. The sea grant program is funded through the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, which governs the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the study is to show that a national marine sanctuary can be managed 
in a way that protects the environment while contributing to the local economy. 
Information gained in the study will be applied to seven other national marine 
sanctuaries. 
</P>

A 23-year-old Port Hueneme man received severe head injuries after his 
motorcycle collided with a car south of the Camarillo Airport, authorities said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher W. Peacock, 23, was in a coma when he was admitted to Ventura 
County Medical Center after the accident Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman would not say whether Peacock regained consciousness, 
but she said that his condition has improved from critical to serious, and that 
he was in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Peacock was driving east on Pleasant Valley Road about 5 p.m. when a car 
turning off Wood Road pulled into his path, a California Highway Patrol 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact sent Peacock flying off his motorcycle and onto the pavement. The 
driver of the car, Polonio S. Romero, 31, of Oxnard, escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed pending completion of an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Peacock suffered a broken leg, collarbone and wrist in addition to the head 
injuries, the CHP spokeswoman said. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

SHE'S OFF TO A FROSH START; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSITIONS: 'YEA, FREEDOM!' STEPHANIE HOPKINSON YELLS AS SHE MOVES INTO A DORM 
TO BEGIN LIFE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT. 
</P>

<P>
Remember when the greatest quandary was whether to wear tennis shoes or flats 
to class? When the goal of the day was getting a telephone in the dorm room? 
When hours could be devoted to chatting with new roommates? 
</P>
<P>
That was the life of Stephanie Hopkinson, 17, of Woodland Hills as she began 
her freshman year at Cal State Northridge last week. 
</P>
<P>
What at first promised to be a rocky start -- when a glitch appeared in her 
computer-produced class registration -- smoothed out considerably as Hopkinson 
breezed through the labyrinthine system on equal doses of ingenuity, 
persistence and luck. 
</P>
<P>
She indulged in all the traditional freshman activities, from the 
mother-daughter credit card passing, to the high school bulletin board hanging 
and the quick flight from the organized dorm party. "It was claustrophobic," 
she said of the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
But in this computer age, registration is far from traditional. No long lines. 
No shopping for classes as if they were vegetables. No intimidating meetings 
with advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, modern-day students mail in their forms and then wait for their 
schedules to appear in their mailboxes. That's it. Theoretically. 
</P>
<P>
A stray eraser mark on Hopkinson's registration prompted the university's 
computer to leave an introductory psychology class off her schedule. So she 
joined about 10,000 other students in the snaking lines of computer-assisted 
registration -- or CAR -- repair day. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to be prepared to be here all day," she said that morning. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 a.m., half an hour before her appointment, things looked bad. Giant 
paperboards outside the registration building were covered with the ominous red 
words "closed" and "canceled." Only two sections of psychology remained that 
fit her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my gosh," she said, scribbling down the section numbers. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was herded inside, those two classes were also full. But 
Hopkinson moved fast. She struck up a conversation with the woman next to her 
in line, learned she was dropping one of the introductory classes and begged 
the psychology professor in charge -- "pleeeeease" -- to let her have that 
opening, instead of giving it to one of the names on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the luckiest person in the world. Life is just beautiful," she said, 
laughing, as she rushed out after only 10 minutes in the registration checkout 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkinson graduated from El Camino High School last spring with average grades 
and test scores that she knew would never carry her to a University of 
California campus. She chose CSUN, she said, mainly because it is close to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
She was encouraged to live on campus by her mother, Joyce, who lived in the 
dorms while attending college in Connecticut, even though her family's home was 
also within commuting distance. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, the dormitory parking lots were gridlocked by cars and trucks 
brimming with suitcases, boxes and plastic bags filled with students' 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkinson was doing her share. Besides mountains of clothes and linens, there 
were the large items: a stereo, a microwave, a computer she got from her 
parents for graduation and her bulletin board, covered with high school and 
soccer memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my gosh, girl!" exclaimed her roommate, Nicole Noyes of Simi Valley, as she 
hung up an armload of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never wear half of this stuff," Hopkinson conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a trend in the '80s for students to dress for success, the style now 
has definitely swung back to informal. Hopkinson wears the basic uniform: white 
leather high tops with lots of shoelaces, bulky athletic socks, shorts and 
baggy shirts, mostly in pastel colors. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting in line to get checked into the dorm, she was showered with advice from 
seasoned sophomores and juniors: Be sure to log every hole in the wall or the 
housing office will charge you for them at the end of the year; avoid the dorm 
"Dating Game" night -- it's a bore. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to lock your door because people come around at night and try all the 
doorknobs," said sophomore Ken Davis, 19. "We had a few stereos stolen that way 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
The rooms in The Parks, CSUN's newest dormitories, are long, narrow white 
closets with an extra-long single bed and small desk shimmied up against each 
wall. But each two-bedroom suite shares an ample living room, bathroom and 
small kitchenette. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow. This is a lot nicer than when I went to college," Joyce Hopkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and Rod Hopkinson helped their daughter with the move. They met her 
roommates' parents and compared their daughters' respective sports injuries. 
Rod Hopkinson quietly quizzed one of the housing coordinators about security in 
the dorms. 
</P>
<P>
As her parents left for home, Stephanie Hopkinson shouted: "Yea, freedom!" 
</P>
<P>
Her plan for the first hours after moving into the dorm was to work at getting 
her telephone hooked up. "Ooooh, I can't stand not to have a phone," she had 
said a few days earlier. But Noyes had already taken care of that, with the 
requisite call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they borrowed their mothers' credit cards and headed for Mervyn's and 
Strouds, where they completed the adornment of their dorm beds, which double as 
couches and study coves, with more pillows. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dorm's first party -- Monte Carlo night -- was too crowded for her 
tastes, Hopkinson and her roommates all are hoping for active social lives. For 
now, they compare notes about cute guys they've spotted roaming in the dorm. 
</P>
<P>
"We have almost a whole guys' floor. Did you know that?" Noyes asked as they 
unpacked their boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool!" Hopkinson replied. 
</P>
<P>
Slang from the '60s and '70s has been recycled. Besides "cool," Hopkinson and 
her roommates punctuate conversations with words like "awesome" and 
"ding-dong." They preface most exclamations with "so" as in "so bad," "so good" 
and "so-o-o-o cute." 
</P>
<P>
Her first class was Tuesday -- Psychology 150 -- and the course is so popular 
that students filled all 42 desks in the small room and dozens more stood 
single-file against the walls. Hopkinson had gotten there early enough to get a 
desk near the front. 
</P>
<P>
Her psychology instructor was practically a contemporary. Laura Steiger, 23, a 
teacher intern who is in her second year of graduate studies at CSUN, described 
psychology as more than just "solving weird movie mysteries" in television 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The two ends of the spectrum -- class clown and obsessive studier -- were 
already making themselves known. When Steiger asked what students think of when 
they hear the word psychology, the joker blurted out, "Couches." Later, the 
studier asked if she could tape-record lectures. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so nice, I can't believe it," Hopkinson said of Steiger as she left the 
class. "I always think of psychology professors as those old men with pot 
bellies. She explains things so well. She's so easy to understand." 
</P>
<P>
But by week's end, Hopkinson was less enthusiastic. The psychology text seemed 
pretty boring, she said, and she was already feeling a little overwhelmed by 
the hard work piling up ahead. She had a half dozen midterms scheduled, as well 
as several nights of more immediate homework: more chapters to read in her 
psychology and government texts, a tape of a Martin Luther King sermon to 
listen to and a speech to write. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a lot," she said.

NEW IDEAS ABOUT TEACHING BLOOM AT CAMELLIA ELEMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WHEN PRINCIPAL JUDITH HERGESHEIMER TRANSFERRED THERE TWO YEARS AGO, 
TEST SCORES WERE AMONG THE CITY'S LOWEST. 
</P>

<P>
As children prepare to begin school Tuesday, the talk among Los Angeles school 
district and teachers union bigwigs is the start-up of a landmark plan to grant 
committees of teachers, parents and principals far-reaching authority over the 
ailing city school system. 
</P>
<P>
But the work of Camellia Avenue Elementary School Principal Judith Hergesheimer 
suggests that maybe schools need new ideas rather than new bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Hergesheimer has combined the elements of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's highly touted magnet school program with a power-sharing management 
style that has earned her North Hollywood school districtwide attention as well 
as a prestigious grant. 
</P>
<P>
"If she can persuade people to buy into the idea, that's great," said Los 
Angeles district Supt. William R. Anton. "The bottom line is that it works as 
long as kids are learning." When Hergesheimer transferred to Camellia two years 
ago, school test scores were among the lowest in the city. She said she had no 
time to wait for the Los Angeles school district to begin "school-based 
management," an ambitious reorganization giving parents and teachers a greater 
say in the running of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Under the district reorganization, which was part of the teachers strike 
settlement 15 months ago, all of the district's more than 600 schools have 
elected decision-making councils that are intended to run the schools in future 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Hergesheimer said drastic action was needed at Camellia right away. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever was happening here before wasn't working," Hergesheimer said. "Our 
test scores were well below the district and state ranks. That almost gave us 
carte blanche. It's easier to take a risk when you don't have much to lose." 
</P>
<P>
So Hergesheimer did what successful principals have been doing for years -- she 
set a new course for the school and enlisted support from teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
At one of the first faculty meetings after transferring from Melvin Avenue 
Elementary School in Reseda, which had won an award for excellence from the 
U.S. Department of Education, Hergesheimer told the teachers she wanted to make 
Camellia more like a magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a voluntary desegregation plan, Los Angeles school district 
officials created magnet schools that specialize in subjects such as the arts, 
science and math, or offer programs for gifted students. The test scores at Los 
Angeles magnet schools are well above the district's average and waiting lists 
are sometimes years long. 
</P>
<P>
"The magnet schools are popular, parents want their children there, teachers 
want to work there, so I asked, 'What can we do to emulate the positive aspects 
of the magnet school?' " Hergesheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
The result was the creation of Camellia's "mini-magnet" program. The 1,000 
students who attend the year-round school are grouped into four tracks having 
vacations at different times throughout the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Hergesheimer asked teachers in each track to develop classroom lessons around a 
particular theme. 
</P>
<P>
The themes are communication, performing and visual arts, social science and 
the arts, and social science and the world community. Students also study 
state-required disciplines that include math, English and reading. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to bring the teachers in each track together, to build a 
curriculum that hangs together rather than isolating subjects and specific 
skills," Hergesheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Camellia mini-magnet idea has earned the attention of big-name oil and 
banking foundations that make up the California Educational Initiatives Fund, 
which awarded the school a $12,000 grant. The school has also been selected as 
a model school by the district, one of only two in the San Fernando Valley and 
13 citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"Magnet schools all have themes, but what is new at Camellia is four themes at 
once," said Raymond Jung, a professor of education at Cal State Northridge who 
has been hired by the district to evaluate the school program at the end of the 
1990-91 school year. "Its purpose must be to improve student achievement 
through improved instruction." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jung, the school will also be evaluated by a board of trustees 
to oversee the state grant this year. Selection of board members by school 
officials was promised as part of the grant proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Because the mini-magnet began only last year, it is still too early to measure 
whether students are learning more. Student test scores at Camellia ranked well 
below district and state averages, and the sixth-graders who graduated in 1988 
scored last in the reading portion of the California Assessment Program test 
when ranked against 37 other elementary schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of being discouraged by the low test scores, teachers arrive early 
for work and talk enthusiastically of the new plan. Parents in the largely 
Latino, working-class neighborhood now fill the auditorium for meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is an example of what the magnet school idea could do for all children," 
said Camellia parent Tony Alcala. 
</P>
<P>
Norman K. Crocker, the Camellia teachers union representative and a fourth- and 
fifth-grade teacher said "the program is working well. All the teachers are 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
In teacher Julie Baron's sixth-grade class, for example, students are creating 
an imaginary classroom banking system that enables them to write checks for 
purchases such as toys and books with money earned from classroom jobs such as 
line monitor and cleanup crew. Bounced checks cost students $10 and rent for 
their desk space is $20 a month. They earn $1.25 a day for attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the year, students in Baron's class will choose countries in Africa to 
study and create a new banking system for those countries. They will eventually 
trade goods and services among themselves, requiring knowledge of international 
rates of exchange, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our theme is 'Social Science, the World Around Us,' " Baron said. "For me, 
teaching out of the textbook is boring. For the students, they are more likely 
to remember something if they've experienced it." 
</P>
<P>
First-grade teacher Patty Lopez, whose students are also studying a social 
science theme, said pupils are creating a mural showing their homes and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"To teach children about their environment you have to start with something 
they know," Lopez said. "After we draw their neighborhoods we can go on to talk 
about North Hollywood, then California and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Hergesheimer said the work of those teachers and others illustrates her desire 
to have students experience what they learn. Students are creating museums and 
giving other classes tours, and they are putting on performances of plays and 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Camellia teacher Nancie Perozzi, who has a combination class of second- and 
third-graders, said the classroom activities being created in the school's 
mini-magnet program are giving children a chance to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they can sing or dance, or work the computer, or sew a costume, 
something besides just pushing a pencil," Perozzi said. "The results may not 
show up right away but maybe we can get them hooked on school and keep them 
from dropping out in the ninth grade."

251 ARRESTED BY TASK FORCE IN GANG CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested 251 people, 104 of them suspected gang members, 
during an anti-gang crackdown in the San Fernando Valley late Saturday and 
early Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A 200-officer task force, named Operation Hammer, canvassed all five Valley 
police divisions during the nine-hour sweep, which began at 5 p.m. Saturday, 
Officer Jerry Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests ranged from traffic violations to major crimes of assault and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Sexton said 53 people were arrested on suspicion of felonies and the rest on 
suspicion of misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, police impounded 35 cars, confiscated four firearms and seized 
34.9 grams of unspecified narcotics, Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinators of the sweep, which is conducted periodically throughout Los 
Angeles, said no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
A similar operation conducted Friday and Saturday on the Westside led to the 
arrest of 75 people, 46 of whom were believed to be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Officers involved in the Valley operation patrolled their own divisions. Police 
said the officers have identified gang members in their areas and questioned 
people who fit gang profiles.

MAN KILLS WIFE, SELF IN FRONT OF SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was murdered by her estranged husband, who then shot and killed himself 
in front of their 26-year-old son at a Chula Vista boatyard Sunday afternoon, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mona McGee, 49, who lived in Los Angeles, where she managed a retirement home, 
had come to the California Yacht Marina at 640 Marina Parkway, where her 
husband, Charles Andrew McGee, 56, lived on a boat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
She had come to retrieve some of her personal property, which she had finished 
loading into her car when the shooting occurred at 12:22 p.m., said Patti 
Holian, spokeswoman for the Chula Vista Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Holian said Mona McGee was talking to her son, whose name was not released, 
"and by the son's description, there appeared to be no problem, until suddenly 
the father opened fire on the mother, then shot himself. In other words, the 
son said there was no obvious disagreement or problem until the shooting 
erupted." 
</P>
<P>
Mona McGee died at the scene, and Charles McGee was pronounced dead shortly 
afterward at UC San Diego Medical Center, according to a spokesman for the San 
Diego County coroner. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy on both will be performed today.

SCUFFLE IS FATAL TO ILLEGAL MIGRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illegal migrant from Mexico was shot and killed late Saturday night as he 
attempted to seize a Border Patrol agent's gun during a scuffle, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Mandujano Navarro was shot once in the chest in a parking lot at 700 
Camiones Way in San Ysidro, according to the Border Patrol and San Diego Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect and four other undocumented aliens were seen running north from the 
border fence, 200 yards west of where Interstate 5 connects to Mexico, at 11:45 
p.m. Saturday, said Ted Swofford, a Border Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The agent, a four-year member of the force whose name was not released, 
displayed his badge, but the suspect swung at him with his fists and began 
running south, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandujano picked up a rock and threw it at the agent, then ran into a drainage 
ditch, where he hit the officer in the head with his clenched fist, which 
contained a rock, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
As the agent tried to subdue Mandujano, the suspect grabbed for the agent's 
holstered gun, which accidentally discharged, killing the suspect, Swofford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol said it is customary in such cases for both the police and 
the FBI to investigate.

TENNIS: SAMPRAS GETS 13 ACES -- GIVING HIM 100 FOR TOURNAMENT -- AND UPSETS 
FOURTH-SEEDED AGASSI FOR U.S. OPEN TITLE.

<P>
The U.S. Open crowned its youngest men's singles champion Sunday when 
19-year-old Pete Sampras won his first Grand Slam title, the lightning in his 
racket flashing under a dirty gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who grew up idolizing Rod Laver and dropped out of high school to 
chase his own tennis dream, scored the biggest upset in the U.S. Open men's 
final since 1957 when unseeded Mal Anderson won the title. 
</P>
<P>
Before 19,288 on a cool day, Sampras routed Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, in a 
1-hour 42-minute display of serving prowess that seemed to numb even Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem real," said Sampras, from Rancho Palos Verdes. "It's going to 
take a while for it to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who had 100 aces in his seven matches, knocked 13 past fourth-seeded 
Agassi to send him to his second Grand Slam final defeat since June. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who lost the French Open title to Andres Gomez, was asked to describe 
what happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I lost it, I got my . . . kicked," Agassi said. "That's about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Seeded No. 12, Sampras breezed through his seven matches, losing only three 
sets -- one each to John McEnroe, Ivan Lendl and Thomas Muster. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on kind of a roll and played really well from the first point on," 
Sampras said. "I had absolutely no nerves or anything about being in my first 
Grand Slam final. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," he said. "I had a great time out there." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras quickly made friends when he then announced that he planned to spend 
his $350,000 prize money on a giant cocktail party for the media. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, the U.S. Open was just one big party for Sampras, who at 19 
years 28 days old, replaced Oliver S. Campbell as the youngest U.S. Open 
winner. Campbell was 19 years 6 months when he won the men's title in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sampras, the lowest-seeded player to win the U.S. Open was 10th-seeded 
John Newcombe in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras had never gone beyond the round of 16 in his eight previous Grand Slam 
appearances. Before his third-round match with Muster, Sampras said he was not 
ready to win a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I proved myself wrong," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
Quite unexpectedly, the biggest weapon in the 110th U.S. Open was Sampras' 
serve. He counted 111 service winners in addition to his 100 aces and unloaded 
on Agassi with a fury. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras won 92% of his first serves, winning 35 of 38 points. Agassi claimed 
only 14 points on Sampras' serve and had only three break point chances, 
missing them all. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras gave every indication that if the 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, match had gone 
further, the next two sets would have been 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed the first set in 36 minutes, needing a single service break in the 
third game when Agassi sent a forehand long. It would be one of his 20 unforced 
forehand errors, but the first costly one. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras aced Agassi twice to even the second set at 1-1 and blew three break 
points in the next game. Agassi wasn't as lucky in the fifth game. Sampras got 
to break point with a stunning forehand service return down the line, then 
broke to 3-2 with a forehand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi was down, 5-3, when he served to stay in the set. Another forehand found 
the net to bring Sampras to set point, and he converted immediately with a 
backhand return down the line. 
</P>
<P>
After 67 minutes, Sampras was up two sets and Agassi was shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always had a big serve, but he's put together some really exceptional 
placement on his serves the last couple of weeks," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you looked at the (videotape), you'd see all his aces are on the line," he 
said. "That's just tough. The chances of returning serves that are hit 100 
m.p.h. when it hits the line are slim, not to mention when he can blast one 120 
m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's only chance to get back in the match came early in the third set. 
Sampras saved two break points in the first game and another in the third, then 
broke Agassi at love for 4-2 with another backhand down the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he would go for more shots and winners, and he just seemed 
tentative," Sampras said. "He wasn't being the aggressor. He was letting me 
dictate play and I think that was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, play was over. Agassi, who said he would admit to being flat but didn't 
want to take any credit away from Sampras, walked to the baseline to serve at 
2-5. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi fell behind, 0-30, but forced deuce twice before back-to-back forehands 
found the net. When the last one ended there, at 6:02 p.m. EDT, Sampras raised 
his arms in triumph, and, smiling, turned to the seats where his coach, Joe 
Brandi, was standing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is way ahead of where I thought Pete would be," Brandi said. "But I guess 
he's just a little ahead of my timetable." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi shook hands with Sampras over the net, then pulled him closer and 
whispered something in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he deserved it," said Agassi, who described the outcome as "a good 
old-fashioned street mugging." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi acknowledged that he could have played better, that he was hitting the 
ball well enough, but also that Sampras decided the match, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is just beating you like he was, there's not a whole lot to get 
frustrated about," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything he touched turned to gold out there," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning the year ranked No. 81, Sampras entered the U.S. Open No. 12, 
but he will be No. 6 when the new IBM/ATP rankings are released today. 
</P>
<P>
It was only five years ago that Sampras changed from a two-handed backhand to a 
one-handed backhand and became a serve-and-volley player instead of a 
counter-puncher. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, if someone had told him at the beginning of the year that he 
would win the U.S. Open in September, Sampras had a ready response. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have said you're pretty crazy," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
But what happened then? It's pretty simple, actually. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I played today, I really don't know if anyone could have beaten me," 
Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jana Novotna and Helena Sukova, who were looking for the Grand Slam of women's 
doubles, didn't find it. The second-seeded team of Gigi Fernandez and Martina 
Navratilova defeated the top seeded team in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4. It was 
Navratilova's 31st major doubles victory. "We didn't want them to win the Grand 
Slam by beating us and (we) become a trivia question," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
SWEET SERVICE 
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, 19 years and 28 days, became the youngest U.S. Open champion 
Sunday with a straight-set victory over Andre Agassi. For Sampras, the 
foundation of his first Grand Slam title was built on his strong serve, the 
fastest clocked in the 120-m.p.h. range. Sampras finished with 100 aces. 
Coupled with 111 service winners -- serves the other player touches with his 
racket but cannot return -- Sampras' serves were the story of the U.S. Open.

The International Amateur Athletics Federation called on South African and 
African representatives to consider returning South Africa to international 
track and field competition. 
</P>

The appeal came a week after Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the 
International Olympic Committee, said that the IOC would await a recommendation 
from African nations on whether South Africa would be readmitted to the Olympic 
Games.

CHARGERS FAKE OUT THEMSELVES, LOSE, 17-14;

<P>
COWBOYS: DALLAS TURNS A BOTCHED FAKE-PUNT PLAY INTO THE GO-AHEAD TOUCHDOWN.

<P>
The Dallas Cowboys got a gift on Sunday and converted it into the team's first 
home victory under Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman made San Diego Coach Dan Henning pay dearly for 
a fake punt gamble as the Cowboys beat the Chargers, 17-14, Sunday before 
48,063 at Texas Stadium -- the smallest home crowd in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cowboys' first home victory since Sept. 25, 1988, when they defeated 
Atlanta. The victory ended a streak of 14 consecutive home losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking for that, it's been a long time," Aikman said of the 
victory. "I've had a lot of abuse from the press. But all the work we've done 
has made it worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman sneaked into the end zone from one yard out with 1:58 left after 
directing a 53-yard scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had tried the fake punt on fourth and six with 5:15 remaining. 
Linebacker Gary Plummer was stopped by Bill Bates and Daniel Stubbs after a two 
yard-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew something was up," said Bates, captain of the special teams. "We 
expected them to try something. The tackle didn't try to block me like he does 
normally." 
</P>
<P>
Henning was distraught about losing a game which the Chargers seemingly had 
wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dumb mistake," Henning said. "I was hoping somebody would bail me out 
on it but it wasn't blocked correctly. I should have called it off. It's a 
disappointing loss, the kind I'll carry around a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith, a first-round pick from Florida who held out 
for a club record 48 days, rushed two times for two yards. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson got the game ball, his second. The first came from the Cowboys' only 
1989 victory, 13-3 over Washington at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling," Johnson said. "This win will allow us to gain momentum 
and win again. If it had gone the other way, it would have meant a lot more 
hard work." 
</P>
<P>
It was San Diego's fourth consecutive opening loss. The Chargers are now 18-13 
in the first game of the season. Dallas has the NFL record of 23-7-1.

The Chargers lost, but at least linebacker Junior Seau made it through the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Seau was booted from the exhibition loss to the Raiders after only 
two plays for fighting with an opposing lineman. This time, in the Chargers' 
17-14 loss Sunday to the Dallas Cowboys in Texas Stadium, he played a full 
game, making four tackles and assisting on three others. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, the Chargers' top draft pick who missed most of training camp because of 
a contract holdout, entered on the sixth play and made his first tackle on the 
Cowboys' second possession, holding fullback Darly Johnston to one yard. 
</P>
<P>
If playing an entire game was a thrill for Seau, it wasn't apparent from his 
postgame comments. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no 'I' in we," he said. "You've got to play together as a team. And we 
lost. A loss is a loss, and I can't be overjoyed by that." 
</P>
<P>
Seau got in trouble with the officials only once when he was whistled for a 
late hit on wide receiver Kelvin Martin. The penalty moved the ball from the 
Charger 23 to the 12 and helped the Cowboys continue a drive that resulted in a 
Ken Willis field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for the penalty, I think he played pretty good," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said. "He was overanxious and hyper and did some things that weren't 
completely right, but he plays with a lot of energy, and he plays an aggressive 
game." 
</P>
<P>
The revamped special teams unit was improved, though there were mistakes that 
brought back memories of last season.

Kicker Fuad Reveiz, the former Miami Dolphin kicker who earned a roster spot 
after being signed as a free agent in March, missed a 31-yard field goal that 
would have given the Chargers a 17-7 lead in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an embarrassing kick to miss," he said. "It happened. You just have to go 
on from there and not let it get you down the rest of the season. I've been 
hitting the ball really well in practice. I just mis-hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Other special teams' miscues included wide receiver Nate Lewis' fumble after a 
26-yard kickoff return. The big one, of course, was the fake punt in the fourth 
quarter that failed because of a missed blocking assignment and lead to the 
Cowboys' winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the Chargers had good field position throughout the game, 
and running back Jerry Mays, the punt returner, flashed several nifty moves. 
</P>
<P>
With a wry grin on his face, Cowboy owner Jerry Jones spoke afterward of the 
joy of winning, which he hasn't been able to do for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we matched last year's record," said Jones, whose Cowboys 
were 1-15 last season. "I'm just really thrilled for our players." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman, the Cowboys' multimillion-dollar quarterback who was the subject 
of much criticism during his rookie season in 1989, finished with 13 
completions in 29 attempts for 193 yards. He was far from great -- on one play, 
he killed a Cowboy drive by throwing a rainbow into the hands of linebacker 
Billy Ray Smith in the end zone -- but the victory was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"From a personal standpoint, it feels good to finally be able to get that 
monkey off my back and win one," Aikman said. "I don't have to listen to people 
say I can't win a ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman didn't play in the Cowboys' lone victory last season because he was 
injured. Steve Walsh, also a rookie last year, quarterbacked the Cowboys past 
Washington, 13-3, on Nov. 5.

LA JOLLA ROUGH WATER SWIM;

RODRIGUES, KNIGHT LEAVE FIELD IN A FOG

<P>
A rosy-cheeked little girl with hope in her heart approached the check-in desk 
at La Jolla Cove shortly after noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to get to swim today?" she asked in a small but determined voice. 
</P>
<P>
After a delay of an hour and 45 minutes, she got her answer when the 60th La 
Jolla Rough Water Swim resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Shark scares, polio outbreaks and wars have caused cancellation of one of the 
premier rough-water swims in the country 14 times since 1916. But never has it 
been a casualty of weather, much less fog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never cloudy in September. This is June weather," said Ken Kimball, a 
co-founder of U.S. Masters Swimming and a participant in the event since 1962. 
"There's been rain, and thunder and lightning, but it's only delayed it, never 
canceled it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials reasoned that if you couldn't see the buoys that marked the 1-mile 
course, you couldn't swim it, not safely anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate concern was for the swimmers," said Bill Uncapher, event director 
the past 16 years. "We've had a perfect track record (no deaths or major 
injuries) in 60 years, and I like to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Although each swimmer -- 1,200 participated -- is required to sign a waiver 
that releases organizers of liability, Dave Lamott, chairman of Competition 
Committee, said litigation was still a concern. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have been accused of being negligent," Lamott said. "All it would 
take is for one person to veer off course and lose them. I was very concerned 
that we would have to cancel." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers speculated that the unseasonable fog was a result of the humid air 
hitting the chilly (63-degree) water. Although skies in La Jolla were sunny 
Saturday, Kimball said the water temperature had dropped five or six degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun finally burned through the thick blanket of fog and increased 
visibility enough for lifeguard Marshall Parks to give clearance to resume the 
event, swimmers read, cradled babies in their arms, walked dogs and chatted 
with friends. 
</P>
<P>
But those who traveled from out of town figured the wait wasn't going to ruin 
their day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to get a delay," said Gerry Rodrigues of Santa Monica, the overall 
men's masters winner. "Maybe more guys left because they didn't want to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, who skipped the event last year but won it in his first try in 1988, 
didn't wait for the competition. He surged to a quick lead and held it until 
the final 800 yards, when Bari Weick and William Purcell started to close in. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the three of us were lined up," Rodrigues said, "Bari really turned the 
jets on. It was an all-out sprint, and I was fatigued. We stayed together until 
the last 10 yards, where I managed to get a body length lead." 
</P>
<P>
According to Rodrigues, organizers did the right thing in delaying. By the time 
his group -- the men's masters -- hit the water, conditions were close to 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"They made sure you could see the first marker," he said. "They did a good job. 
There was no problem seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's Beth Knight also found the conditions to her liking. Knight easily 
won the women's masters title, finishing almost 90 seconds ahead of the 
second-place finisher in her age group. She is now seven for seven in this 
event, having won since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said that although it has been four or five years since she has been 
seriously challenged here, she still feels pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very aware that this isn't handed to me," she said. "I have to work. 
Every year is different, and I'll just prepare and do the best I can, until my 
number's up."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: UCSD WINDS UP THIRD IN WATER POLO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Host UC San Diego split its two matches Sunday to finish third at the Triton 
Water Polo Invitational at Caynonview Pool. Following an 8-7 loss to Air Force, 
the Tritons defeated Claremont Mudd, 17-3, to finish 2-2 in the round-robin 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Navy won the championship with a 4-0 record, followed by Air Force (3-1). UC 
Davis (1-3) and Claremont Mudd (0-4) were fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In UCSD's victory over Claremont Mudd, sophomore Kevin Vance scored five goals. 
Sophomore Scott Rasmussen, a USDHS graduate, and freshman Andy Steinheimer each 
added three. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SURFING 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, Fla., scored a perfect 50 on one of his five waves 
to win in the finals of the $100,000 Body Glove surfing event at Lower Trestles 
of Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 18, surfing in only his seventh competition as a professional, won 
every heat but one and collected $30,600. 
</P>
<P>
Before turning professional two months ago, Slater was a four-time U.S. amateur 
champion and winner of the 1989 Op Junior competition. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Brown of Santa Barbara, who beat Slater in the quarterfinals, placed 
second in the finals. Charlie Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., and Bud Llamas of 
Huntington Beach finished third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stewart, formerly of Anaheim and now living in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, won 
the bodyboarding division. Stewart, a two-time world champion, collected $5,000 
for his victory. Kyle Maligro of Kalaheo, Hawaii, Ben Severson of Wahiawa, 
Hawaii, and Chris Tennberg of Kalaheo, Hawaii finished second, third and 
fourth.

COIN TOSS BEGAN AZTECS' TROUBLES 
</P>

<P>
Now, this may not exactly be the way you want to begin your football season, 
but it's how the San Diego State Aztecs started theirs Saturday before losing, 
42-21, at Oregon: 
</P>
<P>
Oregon won the toss and elected to defer choosing whether to kick or receive 
until the second half. So the decision reverted back to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw (Oregon) defer, I turned around to get our kickoff team ready," 
SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. "When I turned back around, Coach (Dave) Ohton 
told me, 'You won't believe what happened. We made a mistake.' I said, 'What?!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs chose to kick? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. The Aztecs chose to kick. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon then got to choose which end of the field to defend, so the Aztecs ended 
up kicking into the wind. Andy Trakas' kick traveled only to the 10, and 
Michael McClellan returned it to the 41. 
</P>
<P>
"Our young men got confused," Luginbill said. "I was as surprised as anybody . 
. . but I have to take responsibility for it." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill doesn't name captains; various Aztec seniors represent the team at 
the coin-flip throughout the season. Saturday, Jimmy Raye, Morey Paul and Jason 
Bill did the duty. 
</P>
<P>
But don't blame them for a day gone sour. There likely aren't enough erasers in 
the state to erase all of SDSU's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, though, Luginbill wasn't moping as the game film rolled along. He 
wasn't swearing or throwing things. Muttering, maybe, but nothing out of the 
ordinary. The explanation was simple, he said. The Aztecs didn't execute. And 
that, he insisted, can be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The more difficult question to answer, though, was why the Aztecs didn't 
execute. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no answer for that," he said. "I've been asking myself that same 
question from the start of the game . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What I'll really be concerned about is if there isn't drastic improvement 
between this game and this Saturday's game (at home against Cal State Long 
Beach). Then we've got some real concerns. This is a gut-check week for this 
football program. . . . This group of young men has to decide how important it 
is to them to focus and take command of their personal responsibilities within 
a football game." 
</P>
<P>
There were blown coverages, bad alignments and total breakdowns at times 
Saturday. Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave, a fifth-year senior, toasted the 
Aztecs for 31 completions (a personal best) and 443 yards (third most allowed 
ever by an Aztec defense). He threw for three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Tony Hargain caught 10 passes for 206 yards -- fourth-best by a 
receiver against an SDSU defense. Tight end Jeff Thomason was left uncovered 
several times and ended up with 110 yards on seven catches. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec free safety Johnny Walker led the team with 11 tackles. The free safety, 
the deepest guy in the defense, is not the person you want leading your team in 
that statistic. 
</P>
<P>
"All during the week, our coaches told us that they were going to run a lot of 
formations and try to confuse us," cornerback Marlon Andrews said after the 
game. "We practiced, but we still got confused. We didn't align right, and it 
killed us." 
</P>
<P>
How often were the Aztecs aligned wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"Several times," Andrews said. "Almost every snap in the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
There were also 93 yards lost on 10 penalties. Four of them came in the first 
quarter alone, costing SDSU 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire (20 completions in 40 attempts for 223 yards, two 
touchdowns and no interceptions) was inconsistent. Receivers dropped passes. 
Still, the Aztecs pulled to within 28-21 near the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That became a real boxing match right there in the first part of the fourth 
quarter, latter part of the third quarter," Luginbill said. "And they knocked 
us out. We put our punch in there, and it wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Well, at least the Aztecs can say nobody got hurt. They have no new injuries to 
report going into this week's game against Cal State Long Beach (0-2). The old 
ones, updated going into this week: linebacker Lou Foster (hamstring, probable 
for this week's game), defensive lineman Steve Matuszewicz (ankle, 
questionable) and defensive back Zac Stokes (shoulder, doubtful). . . . Schools 
normally exchange game film before they play each other. Cal State Long Beach 
Coach George Allen, though, does things differently, and Thursday, SDSU was 
informed it would not be receiving any. SDSU obtained one through Clemson, the 
49ers' first opponent. Coach Al Luginbill said he was told that's the way Allen 
does things. "I think it's very unprofessional, but that's his deal," he said.

U.S. Firms Plan Less Hiring: A Manpower Inc. survey showed that 23% of American 
businesses plan to boost hiring in the fourth quarter, down from 29% a year 
ago. But the figures don't suggest a recession, said Mitchell Fromstein, 
president of Milwaukee-based Manpower. "In a recession, that number would be 11 
or 12 percent," he said.

Ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait five weeks ago, the Bush Administration has been 
striving to make sure that Saddam Hussein goes to bed every night not knowing 
whether he will wake up to the thunder of U.S. military force. 
</P>
<P>
At their otherwise harmonious summit meeting Sunday, however, President Bush 
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev differed sharply on that approach, 
with Gorbachev insisting at a joint press conference that Moscow is firmly 
opposed to the military option. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have a difference on that," Bush conceded. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is primarily a tactical one. Bush and Gorbachev agreed to maintain 
-- and if necessary increase -- the economic and political pressure on Iraq. 
But Gorbachev's reluctance to sanction the use of force may be taken by Hussein 
as a signal that he faces no immediate danger of attack. That could cause him 
to dig in his heels and wait out the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Gorbachev may change his mind if economic sanctions prove to be 
inadequate. But it seems clear that the Soviet president wants to give the 
trade embargo and other political measures a very long trial. 
</P>
<P>
Delay costs Gorbachev nothing. But the United States, with more than 100,000 
military personnel already in the region, can ill afford a prolonged standoff. 
Although Saudi Arabia and the exiled government of Kuwait have agreed to pay 
much of the $1-billion-a-month cost of the deployment, the United States would 
find it difficult to keep such a large force in place if the conflict becomes a 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush stressed repeatedly that he, too, favors a peaceful resolution to 
the crisis, he said it would be wrong to tip off Iraq by closing out the 
military option. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not say that if Iraq does not withdraw peacefully, we're going to have 
recourse to military methods," Gorbachev said. " . . . Our country and the 
United Nations . . . (have) a whole range of possibilities of finding a 
political solution to this problem. Therefore, I would limit ourselves to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, talking to a small group of reporters 
after the Bush-Gorbachev news conference, insisted that Washington is satisfied 
with the words of the joint statement in which Bush and Gorbachev promised to 
consider additional measures "consistent with the U.N. Charter" if the present 
embargo does not force Iraq to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the charter does not prohibit the use of force in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"You might conclude from the press conference that the Soviets are not on board 
yet on the use of force," Baker said. "But you have a joint statement that 
doesn't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he (Hussein) will take any joy out of reading this statement," 
Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
American officials conceded that Bush and Gorbachev did not go significantly 
further in their condemnation of Iraq than Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze did in a statement issued the day after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker said the reaffirmation of Moscow's stand against Iraq was significant 
in itself. He noted that on Saturday, Hussein had called on Moscow to "act like 
a superpower" and repudiate the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev also disagreed publicly over a Soviet proposal for a Middle 
East peace conference to consider both the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 
festering Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that is taking place in the Middle East is a matter of concern to 
us -- of equal concern," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush said that the U.N. resolutions calling for Iraq to withdraw 
from Kuwait "should be implemented on their face without trying to tie it in to 
some other unresolved dispute." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush said he would support a renewed effort to implement a 
23-year-old U.N. resolution calling for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip "to secure and recognized boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that that (Israeli-Palestinian) question eventually, and 
hopefully sooner than later, be resolved," Bush said.

LIBERIAN REBELS SHOOT, CAPTURE PRESIDENT DOE

<P>
A rebel group Sunday captured President Samuel K. Doe of Liberia, a State 
Department official said, adding that U.S. observers believe Doe was wounded 
during a fierce gun battle in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"Our embassy has confirmed that he was captured," said the official, who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching Washington said that Doe was taken into custody by rebel 
Prince Yormie Johnson, who declared himself in charge of Liberia. The reports 
said Doe was wounded in both legs. Asked whether Doe had been shot, the State 
Department official replied: "We assume it's true." 
</P>
<P>
The official said the State Department had received a number of accounts 
describing the shooting, most of them based upon a report by the British 
Broadcasting Corp. The official said the BBC had a correspondent at the scene. 
"There is nothing that I'm getting," the State Department official said, "that 
would differ very much at all with what the BBC is saying." 
</P>
<P>
According to these reports, Johnson telephoned the BBC to say Doe had 
surrendered control of Liberia. The reports said that Johnson pledged not to 
kill Doe -- but wants him to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said he would make Doe available for interviews by reporters from 
the international media. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel Johnson is one of two leaders fighting to topple Doe. The other is 
Charles Taylor, who heads a group known as the National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia. Taylor's group controls most of the country. BBC correspondents said 
it was not immediately clear what Taylor's reaction would be -- or whether 
Doe's capture would end the fighting in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
A peacekeeping force numbering 4,000 men was sent to Monrovia last month by the 
Economic Community of West African States to impose a cease-fire in a civil war 
that has killed thousands. Johnson has welcomed intervention by the 
peacekeepers. But Taylor has called them mercenaries, and he has threatened to 
fight the peacekeepers as long as they are in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
In a rare venture forth from his fortified seaside mansion in Monrovia, Doe and 
several dozen bodyguards paid an unscheduled courtesy call on the head of the 
peacekeeping force, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of Ghana. Johnson and some of his 
forces followed. 
</P>
<P>
A quarrel erupted, and both sides began a raging battle with rifles, machine 
guns and grenades. The battle centered in an area near the headquarters of the 
peacekeeping force. More than 60 were killed in the fight, including many of 
Doe's bodyguards. Doe was shot in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's forces carried Doe off to their base camp, where Johnson said Doe 
would be court-martialed. A short time later, Johnson declared himself 
president and said that he would run Liberia until popular elections can be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the rival rebel leader, previously had claimed the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Doe had swept to power in a bloody coup in 1980. He ruled the West African 
state with an iron fist. The rebel leaders also said that Doe stole millions of 
dollars of state funds and accused him of nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 24, civil war broke out when Johnson and other rebels loyal to Taylor 
invaded from Ivory Coast. In march, Johnson broke away to form a rebel faction 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed to an informal cease-fire when the West African peacekeepers arrived 
in Monrovia two weeks ago. But Taylor continued fighting. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Saturday, Taylor's rebels launched their own attack at the port 
of Monrovia against a group of soldiers in the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
The attack added still more casualties in the confused tangle of civil 
hostilities. The war has left Monrovia without running water and telephone 
communications. It has made food scarce. 
</P>
<P>
American officials in Monrovia said relief shipments of food now in neighboring 
Ivory Coast would remain there until the hostilities cease. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there have been reports of cholera in a refugee camp near the 
port of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,100 U.S. Marines are based on ships off the Liberian coast and are 
standing guard at the U.S. Embassy. They have helped evacuate hundreds of 
foreigners from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have orders not to intervene in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Liberia was founded in 1847 by descendants of American slaves.

DESPITE A HUGE DEFENSE BUDGET, THE FORMIDABLE SELF-DEFENSE FORCES ARE

<P>
A seven-minute walk away from the riotous and affluent youth culture of the 
Shibuya entertainment district, Capt. Yasuo Yamashita sits at his steel desk in 
a small room on the fifth floor of a drab office building. 
</P>
<P>
He has the look of somebody who has been waiting an unbearable length of time 
for the phone to ring or the door to swing open. 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita is a recruiting officer for the Japanese military. Things are awfully 
slow these days, he confides, and getting slower. Here in this strategic center 
of the most populous city in the world, he signs up four or five people in a 
good month, mostly high school dropouts, to serve their country. 
</P>
<P>
The business of enticing the brightest and best young Japanese into taking up 
arms has been a losing proposition ever since the atomic bombs of 1945 ended 
World War II. A stunned Japan adopted a post-war "peace constitution," forever 
renouncing the sovereign right to have a military. 
</P>
<P>
Some legal tinkering by politicians, however, allowed the creation in 1954 of 
what is euphemistically called the "Self-Defense Forces (SDF)." That military 
now has grown into a formidable fighting machine authorized to keep more than a 
quarter-million ground troops, sailors and airmen in uniform. Pacifist Japan's 
defense budget can be calculated, depending on fluctuating currency exchange 
rates, as the third, fourth or fifth highest in the world -- in the ballpark 
with France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
But to Yamashita's chagrin, Japanese society tries its darndest to pretend the 
Self-Defense Forces aren't really out there. His recruiting is handicapped by 
this lack of public acceptance, as well as unattractive housing and benefits. 
And prospects soon may worsen as the number of Japanese in the right age group 
declines and a less-threatening Soviet Union may soon rob the military of its 
main sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The public's ambivalent attitude about the military is shared by the 
government, as evidenced by Japan's belated response Aug. 29 to the crisis in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are now frantically trying to put together a team of 100 volunteer 
medical workers to send to the gulf because it was deemed "unconstitutional" to 
tap the well-trained Self-Defense Forces, even for noncombat personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Agency Chief Yozo Ishikawa, according to news reports, was excluded 
from Cabinet deliberations on American requests that Japan join other allies in 
projecting some kind of military presence, even a symbolic one, in the 
peace-keeping effort. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu declared to the world that his country 
would stand by its dedication to pacifist commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
Since that initial response, however, several leaders of the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party have urged the government to reconsider current constitutional 
interpretations and last Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto 
announced that such a re-examination of the constitution was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which imports 70% of its oil from the Middle East, is not barred by its 
constitution from providing logistical support for American soldiers digging in 
to defend Japan's national interests, Kaifu said. The figure on the table now 
is $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Back at home, military personnel are frustrated, perhaps demoralized, but long 
conditioned to resigning themselves to a pariah status. Consider Yamashita, the 
recruiting officer. He wears a business suit and tie to the office. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out on the front lines, the contact point with the public," he said. "A 
lot of people might think it was strange if we wore uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, Yamashita must now battle adverse demographic trends as 
well as social stigma. The population of 18-year-olds is about to peak at 1.05 
million and is projected to fall below 900,000 by the mid-1990s. With the 
domestic economy expanding rapidly and creating a shortage of unskilled labor, 
the unpopular military gets short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the army cannot fill one out of every four authorized positions in its 
lower enlisted ranks, according to the 1989 Defense White Paper. Last year, the 
Defense Agency had to lower its recruiting goal by 13%. This year, the upper 
age limit was raised from 25 to 27. A proposal is in the works to reconfigure 
the structure of the forces around fewer ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The Self-Defense Forces still aren't accepted by the public," Yamashita said. 
"It would make my job much easier if there was greater recognition, but many 
young people are simply opposed to us. Their teachers are against us. The 
opposition politicians are against us." 
</P>
<P>
Graduates of the National Defense Academy are increasingly reneging on military 
careers -- in March, 60 of the 425 graduating cadets opted for careers in the 
private sector. There is no penalty for refusing commissions, but it was almost 
unheard of until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The SDF's social purpose has become so ambiguous that students no longer feel 
a sense of purpose in the service," an academy officer recently told the 
newspaper Yomiuri. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay published in a military magazine earlier this year, 1st Lt. Kazue 
Sato, 28, chief of the Ground Self-Defense Forces' women education corps, 
grappled with the problem of public acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"What the SDF most needs now is the trust of the Japanese people," Sato wrote. 
"In order to build up this trust, wouldn't it help to dispatch SDF members to 
disaster areas?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, disaster relief is about the only truly conspicuous activity permitted 
the military inside Japan. Proposals to send them abroad as good Samaritans are 
still in the "consensus-building" stage, which means the idea is still too 
controversial to seriously consider taking action. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted last year by the prime minister's office, 72.2% of the 
respondents supported sending military personnel overseas for disaster relief. 
But nearly half were opposed to military participation in United Nations 
peacekeeping forces, a concept approved by only 22.4%. 
</P>
<P>
No opinion polls addressing Japan's possible role in the gulf peacekeeping 
effort have been published. 
</P>
<P>
But so strong is the aversion to any hint of military confrontation that 
seamen's unions and airline officials blocked the government from committing 
Japanese commercial vessels to transporting military hardware or troops in the 
Persian Gulf effort. Even where non-military cargo is involved, Japanese crews 
demand guarantees that there will be absolutely no risk. Kaifu's solution was 
to offer to pay the cost of chartering ships and planes from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, resistance to Japan's stepping forward and assuming more of the 
trappings of a global power in the present Mideast crisis comes as much from 
outside the country as within. Old victims of Imperial Army aggression have let 
it be known that their skin crawls at any sign of Japanese revanchism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Japan's neighbors would be uncomfortable if there were uniformed 
people sent out to the gulf," a U.S. official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one argument for maintaining Japan's dependent security ties to the 
United States is that the American troop presence here is reassuring to Asian 
countries such as Korea and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest constraint on Japan's military posture appears to be a 
genuine streak of idealism reflecting a horrified backlash to the last war. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a mentality, especially in the older generation, that says the 
military got us into the last fix and we will never let that happen again," 
said the U.S. official, a knowledgeable observer who spoke on the condition he 
not be identified by name. "That attitude colors everything to do with the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
Real confusion comes in to the equation, however, when the government continues 
to mobilize considerable taxpayer resources to defend Japan against the Soviet 
military threat in the Far East, a concept that is dying hard despite 
superpower detente and dramatic reforms in the socialist bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Soviet focus may soon dissipate. Kaifu has reportedly asked the 
Defense Agency to delete a routine reference to the Soviet threat in the 1990 
edition of the agency's white paper, due out later this month. The change will 
be good for detente, but it is likely to cast the Japanese military further 
adrift. 
</P>
<P>
"If asked whether they were willing to go to war tomorrow, I think there'd be 
some strong psychological problems," the U.S. official said. "A peacekeeping 
mission like (that) in the gulf would be good for morale. It would give them a 
sense of purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, American occupation authorities were the ones who drafted the 1947 
peace constitution, and forced it on reluctant Japanese political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation 
and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes," 
Article 9 of the constitution states. "Land, sea and air forces, as well as 
other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the 
state will not be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
The Self-Defense Forces got their start in 1950 when Gen. Douglas MacArthur 
ordered the creation of a 75,000-man "police reserve force" to keep order while 
occupying U.S. troops were busy in the Korean War. Eventually, Japan was 
perceived as a loyal anti-communist ally that could help hold Soviet and 
Chinese hegemony in check if it had more than just a token military. 
</P>
<P>
The limits would be tested repeatedly over the post-war era, until Japan's 
right to self-defense was recognized by the courts and -- more or less -- 
accepted by the public. 
</P>
<P>
Egged on by Washington, Tokyo developed a modern and sophisticated defense 
structure, testing a de facto budgetary ceiling of 1% of the gross national 
product, a rising cap because of steady economic growth. The fiscal 1990 
defense budget, approved by Parliament in June, totals 4.2 trillion yen (nearly 
$30 billion at current exchange rates), up 6.1% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense hawks are pushing for more. An aircraft carrier is under consideration. 
A basic plank of Kaifu's ruling Liberal Democratic Party platform is 
constitution revision, and several right-wing party leaders advocate changing 
the Self-Defense Law to prevail over constitutional taboos and allow overseas 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Japan Forum on International Relations issued a report urging that 
the military's capabilities be upgraded substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fair to say the SDF, as presently constituted, does not provide an 
effective deterrent to a conventional attack on Japanese territory," said the 
group of academics headed by former Foreign Minister Saburo Okita. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more at question than mere weaponry in keeping the military 
prepared. One of the urgent tasks now at hand is to improve abysmal housing and 
welfare conditions for enlisted men and women to stem the trend of declining 
recruitment. Spartan double-tiered bunks are gradually being replaced by single 
beds. New, more fashionable uniforms are under design. 
</P>
<P>
A poster on the door to Yamashita's office shows the kind of desperate 
image-making being mustered to seduce new recruits -- an attractive young woman 
in camouflage fatigues is shown grinning from atop an army green trail bike. 
</P>
<P>
Another ubiquitous recruitment poster depicts a sleepy couple in black pajamas. 
The man scratches his head next to a bold red-lettered slogan that asks, "Peace 
-- Is it Something That Can Be Taken for Granted?" 
</P>
<P>
In a typical attempt to soften the military's face, the Defense Ministry last 
year distributed a free booklet to the public illustrated with cartoons, the 
"Visual Defense Reader." On its cover, cute characters lean out of a tank, a 
fighter jet and a submarine behind a happy cartoon family. The same comic-book 
image appears in a recruiting pamphlet in Yamashita's office, with the caption: 
"Searching for unlimited possibilities, in an at-home atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
A degree of domestic comfort may actually be in store. Construction started 
this year on new barracks that for the first time will house women and men 
under the same roof, though on different floors. The women's floor would be off 
limits to men, but the plan envisions fraternization in lounges, with 
soft-drink vending machines by the stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
A new emphasis is being placed on enlisting women, who now make up about 2% of 
the forces, compared with about 10% for the U.S. military. About one-fifth of 
the approximately 4,900 Japanese women already in uniform are nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Women are not eligible for combat jobs, but the military is one of only a few 
employers in Japan that offer equal wages to both sexes. The money is not bad 
for an unskilled woman without a high school diploma. Base pay starts at about 
$850 a month, plus bonuses and severance pay, as well as room and board. In 
1992, the Defense Academy will start enrolling women cadets. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the draw of the military appears to be that of stable, 
civil-service style employment, rather than the patriotism that is often the 
motivation for American recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in this to make a steady living," said Sgt. Hideyuki Ichikawa, 29, a 
bookkeeper who joined the Ground Self-Defense Forces 10 years ago. "At first, I 
thought I'd stay in four years, but it wasn't easy to find work on the outside. 
Now, I'm just at the point where I'm getting good at my job." 
</P>
<P>
Ichikawa was interviewed after a SDF training exercise Saturday near Mt. Fuji, 
in which the public was entertained by tanks, missiles and a steel-helmeted 
army band playing Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" -- with percussion provided by 
real cannons. 
</P>
<P>
Pvt. Sono Naito, 18, said she signed up in April after ruling out training as a 
policewoman. She wants to make a career out of the military. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something special, something more than just ordinary work," 
Naito said. "My high school girlfriends thought I was a little strange, but I'm 
learning a lot -- like how to not waste time."

SOVIETS GET BUSH PLEDGE OF HELP FOR PERESTROIKA;

SUMMIT: THE U.S. LEADER LINKS HIS PLAN TO MOSCOW'S NEW FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS 
SUPPORT FOR GULF MOVES.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, faced with a reeling economy and 
plummeting popularity at home, won a commitment from President Bush on Sunday 
for potentially vital U.S. assistance to underwrite his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very much interested in assisting to be sure that perestroika is 
successful," Bush told a news conference after a day of talks with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Bush linked his proposal, which he said would be divulged in detail at a joint 
session of Congress on Tuesday, to the dramatic changes in Moscow's foreign 
policy and the virtual Soviet-American alliance in confronting Iraq for its 
invasion and seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the common stand of the Soviet Union and the United States have taken at 
the United Nations, it seems to me we should be as forthcoming as we can in 
terms of economics, and I plan to do that," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that the United States, faced with a roughly 
multibillion-dollar budget deficit, is not in the position "to write out large 
checks" but could provide other forms of assistance, perhaps 
government-guaranteed credits and technical aid. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, however, told the same news conference that the Soviet Union would 
not tie its foreign policy to Western rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet 
Union could be bought for dollars," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking later in an interview on Soviet television, Gorbachev described his 
talks with Bush as a breakthrough that will spell relief for his beleaguered 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Administration and political circles in the United States have 
passed through a certain stage in their thinking, and we were quite satisfied 
with their approach," he said. "They believe, first of all, that the world 
community is planning and will strive to cooperate with the Soviet Union to 
help solve its problems faster." 
</P>
<P>
As Bush and Gorbachev were meeting, a delegation of 15 prominent American 
businessmen, led by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, arrived in Helsinki 
en route to Moscow for discussions with Soviet leaders on concrete ways that 
U.S. industry can assist Soviet economic modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the group would discuss energy development, exploitation of 
mineral resources and increased U.S. investment. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Bush had promised to clear legal obstacles toward joint 
Soviet-American development of a new civilian aircraft. "This will be a huge, 
large-scale project that could turn into very big business," he said, adding 
that it involved conversion of the Soviet warplane industry to peaceful 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also pledged that the United States would remove many of the restrictions 
that now limit Western technical cooperation with the Soviet Union, Gorbachev 
told Soviet television. 
</P>
<P>
At their first summit at Malta last December, Bush offered Gorbachev extensive 
U.S. technical assistance to revitalize the Soviet Union's backward economy as 
it shed almost seven decades of central planning and opened itself far wider to 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush envisioned it, the U.S. assistance would focus on improving the 
efficiency of the whole Soviet economic infrastructure, from transport and 
communications to retail distribution and banking. 
</P>
<P>
The transfusion of U.S. managerial know-how and technical expertise would, Bush 
said at Malta, help speed the transformation of the Soviet economy toward one 
based on the market forces of supply and demand and entrepreneurship. 
</P>
<P>
But in the nine months since the two presidents' Malta meeting, the Soviet 
economy has deteriorated at an even faster pace, and the government can no 
longer ensure the supply of even such staples as bread. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's own political position has been undercut as a result; a recent 
opinion poll showed that his popularity had dropped far below that of Boris N. 
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, who advocates faster and more 
radical reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president, speaking with reporters at the end of August, 
acknowledged that in the face of growing popular discontent, his reforms are 
now in their most difficult phase -- they must be implemented immediately or 
fail completely. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious to return to Moscow, where his economic program is under attack from 
both radicals such as Yeltsin and Marxist-Leninist conservatives, Gorbachev 
left Helsinki on Sunday evening, earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet broadcast journalist said that the president had revised his schedule 
in Helsinki because the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet, is opening 
today, with the central issue before lawmakers being the rescue of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Two rival programs have been put forward -- one favored by Prime Minister 
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov that would provide for a step-by-step reshaping of the 
economy, and another, advocated by Yeltsin and his numerous allies, that would 
rapidly sell off state assets and let prices float to achieve the 
transformation in only 500 days. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had originally been expected to present his version to the Supreme 
Soviet, but he decided instead to send it first to the legislatures of the 
country's 15 constituent republics this week for debate and possible 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is hoping that a consensus will emerge on the program and popular 
backing grow if the local legislatures are given the right to approve or modify 
it. 
</P>
<P>
His goal, advisers have said, is to obtain approval this month before the 
Soviet government's 1991 annual budget and economic development plan are 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's offer of U.S. assistance, whatever form it may take, greatly strengthens 
Gorbachev's hand. The Soviet leader favors the faster approach of Yeltsin but 
shares some of the concerns of Ryzhkov about moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
With Bush's pledge, Gorbachev can now argue that his country will have the 
support it needs and ease the fears of his countrymen that economic reform will 
inescapably mean unemployment, higher prices and harder times. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush made it clear that he was not talking about large-scale financial 
assistance. He specifically referred to the Mosbacher delegation, which would 
put private business in the lead of any American aid program. 
</P>
<P>
Joined by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the group of business 
executives led by the secretary of commerce will spend five days in top-level 
discussions with Gorbachev, Ryzhkov, Yeltsin and other Soviet officials in 
Moscow and Leningrad. The delegation includes 15 executives of some of 
America's largest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he and Gorbachev had had "a good, long discussion" about the Soviet 
economic reforms. He indicated that he felt the Kremlin leadership should move 
even faster and more boldly toward a market economy, but he nevertheless 
reiterated his support for Gorbachev and his program.

Baker said later that the two presidents had agreed to push negotiations on an 
investment treaty and resolving old debt claims. The Bush Administration was 
also awaiting Soviet action on free emigration so that it could present the new 
trade agreement to Congress for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We did talk about the steps that need to be taken for us to be a position to 
assist economically, that is through technical economic cooperation and 
otherwise," Baker said on the CNN program, Newsmaker Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has opposed extensive Western financial aid to the Soviet 
Union, arguing that most of it would be wasted because of the sheer 
inefficiency of the economic system. 
</P>
<P>
France, Italy and West Germany have nevertheless provided large credits to 
finance increased Soviet purchases of not only industrial products but also 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
They and other members of the Group of Seven, the major industrialized 
democracies, urged Bush to rethink the U.S. position, warning that time was 
running out for Gorbachev to show his people that economic reform will give 
them a better life. 
</P>
<P>
But the leaders of the Group of Seven, meeting in July, did agree to ask the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development to prepare a study of the Soviet economy, making 
recommendations for reform and establishing criteria for Western economic 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
That study is to be completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, commenting on Bush's pledge, welcomed it as a "normal element of new 
cooperation in trade" and a reflection of improved Soviet-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
But sensitive to the possible criticism at home that he had sold out Soviet 
foreign policy for Western assistance, Gorbachev said, "I wouldn't want 
President Bush's reply to give rise to the opinion that the Soviet Union is 
going to align a certain sum with a certain behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also denied any linkage between the offer of U.S. assistance and Soviet 
foreign policy concessions. "It's not a question of saying in any way -- never 
even a suggestion -- that if you agree to a strong statement on the Persian 
Gulf, we will be more forthcoming economically," he said on CNN. "Not even a 
hint of that ever entered into the discussions."

WEEKEND DEFICIT TALKS ACHIEVE SCANT PROGRESS; 
</P>

BUDGET: DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN NEGOTIATORS PLAN TO CONTINUE THE BARGAINING ON 
TAXES AND SPENDING TODAY.

<P>
Democratic and Republican negotiators, struggling to overcome their 
long-standing budget differences, made little progress in marathon weekend 
talks toward an agreement that would make a significant dent in the federal 
deficit, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, returning from Helsinki, Finland, with President Bush, told reporters 
on Air Force One that the budget talks were not going well. He joined the 
three-day-old meetings taking place here, while Bush, who some thought might 
stop briefly to talk with negotiators, traveled by helicopter to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu said that Bush, who is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress 
Tuesday on his meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the 
Persian Gulf crisis, plans to discuss the budget situation in his televised 
speech but does not expect to announce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, however, some aides had indicated that chances for 
agreement seemed to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
"They are narrowing the gap," said one official close to the negotiations. 
"There's a long way to go and it could still all fall apart, but I see grounds 
for optimism." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators planned to meet again for a fourth day today after working late 
Sunday but will not meet with Bush at the White House, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Budget bargainers -- including White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman, 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and more than a dozen lawmakers from both 
parties -- have set a target of cutting spending and raising taxes by enough to 
slash the fiscal 1991 deficit by $50 billion and to save roughly $500 billion 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
As Administration officials and congressional leaders entered the third 
straight day of almost nonstop meetings, it was not clear whether they could 
achieve such an ambitious goal. 
</P>
<P>
In a day of intense back-and-forth bargaining, Democrats were moving closer to 
the GOP position that the Pentagon budget should not be hacked abruptly during 
the current Persian Gulf crisis, sources said. Democrats had originally 
proposed as much as $15 billion in military cuts next year, while Republicans 
wanted to hold the reductions to only about $4 billion. Both sides, however, 
were still looking at ways to achieve substantial military cuts over the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said aides who spoke only on condition they not be identified, the 
two parties were looking at about $10 billion in cuts from benefit programs 
such as Medicare and farm subsidies. When the talks began on Friday, 
Republicans proposed more than $15 billion in such cuts, while Democrats 
suggested reductions limited to just over $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, however, were having difficulty working out ways to satisfy White 
House demands that any budget agreement must include mechanisms to ensure that 
it can be enforced over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiators continued to work into the evening, other major hurdles also 
remained. Without an agreement, the deficit for the fiscal year that begins on 
Oct. 1 is expected to soar to as much as $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties have proposed raising taxes and fees by roughly the same $25 
billion next year, but they continued to have widely different ideas about how 
to hit that target. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats favor raising income tax rates for the wealthy to go along with 
boosts in taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and energy consumption, while 
Republicans proposed a variety of revenue raisers, including tax increases for 
wine and beer, limits on state and local tax deductions, and insisted that a 
cut in taxes on capital gains must be part of any package. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, moved to this isolated site 10 miles from Capitol Hill to keep 
reporters and lobbyists away from the talks, are being held in a large room 
that normally serves as the officers' bar. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers have done everything possible to make themselves feel at home. 
The club and its adjacent buildings have been transformed into a small-scale 
imitation of the Capitol, with Democratic and Republican cloakrooms, separate 
buildings to meet behind closed doors, computers to crunch numbers, facsimile 
machines and an extensive telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything has gone according to plan, however. After going until almost 
midnight Friday, the talks broke up unexpectedly about 10 p.m. Saturday night 
when a fire alarm forced everyone to evacuate the building. According to one 
aide, a musician attending a long-scheduled wedding held in the sprawling 
complex inadvertently set off the alarm.

The four warring factions in Cambodia appear ready to accept a U.N. peace plan 
to end their 11-year-old war, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the fact that the four factions have indicated they can 
accept the document as the basis for settling the Cambodian conflict," the 
foreign minister said after the opening session of peace talks here. 
</P>
<P>
Alatas said "the circumstances for achieving a comprehensive settlement are 
unlikely ever again to be as favorable as they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas and Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government had no immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The talks were focusing on a plan backed by the five permanent members of the 
U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and 
France -- to end Cambodia's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The plan envisions the formation of a transitional council on which each of the 
four Cambodian factions would be represented. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Supreme National Council would cede much of its authority to the 
United Nations, whose representatives would administer the country until free 
elections could be held. The plan also calls for disarming and regrouping the 
four armies. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier meetings in Indonesia and elsewhere since July, 1988, ended 
inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how to share power before 
elections.

CONGRESSIONAL KUDOS: President Bush's decision to provide increased Western 
economic help to the Soviet Union is likely to win broad support when he 
addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, congressional 
strategists say. 
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered by negative reaction at home to the savings and loan crisis and 
other national ills, the lawmakers have been "looking for something positive" 
that they can support, key Capitol Hill watchers say. Many in Congress already 
appear to be prepared to reward Moscow for backing the United Nations sanctions 
against Iraq. "The Soviets deserve some thanks," the hawkish Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is considering an international effort to provide massive economic aid to 
Moscow -- complementing a modest boost in U.S. assistance with contributions 
from other Western nations. Bureaucrats also are preparing legislation that 
would grant most-favored-nation trade status to Moscow -- a goal the Soviets 
have been pursuing for months. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE THE BOYS ARE: President Bush plans to visit American troops in Saudi 
Arabia, both as a morale-builder and to bolster political support at home. But 
the White House inadvertently confirmed that as it stands now, the President 
isn't expecting the troops to come home soon. Among the dates being considered 
for his visit: Thanksgiving -- or even Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the holdup: an already hectic schedule. The President 
already has an autumn full of political campaign trips on the calendar, and he 
is hoping to revive a plan to spend a week in Latin America, a trip that was 
scuttled because of the Iraq crisis. 
</P>
<P>
WAR WOES: Top U.S. economic policy-makers are becoming increasingly worried 
about the growing weakness of the U.S. economy. Although Bush Administration 
officials are maintaining an optimistic face in public, some strategists are 
fearful that this weakening will squeeze the budget deficit and make it more 
difficult to finance operations in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly troublesome is the continued slide in the value of the dollar, 
which has plunged some 7% since the gulf crisis began -- mainly as a reflection 
of financial markets' fears that the White House is trying to pressure the 
Federal Reserve Board to abandon its stand against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
On White House orders, top Administration officials have eased their criticism 
of the Fed in recent days, but analysts say that much still depends on how well 
White House and congressional negotiators do at hammering out an accord on 
narrowing the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
THE BRADY CRUNCH?: Capital gossips couldn't help notice a big disparity last 
week, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady went on separate round-the-world trips to ask America's 
allies to contribute financially to the campaign against Iraq. Baker brought 
back promises of billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and the exiled emir of 
Kuwait, while Brady had to settle for lukewarm responses from Britain, France, 
South Korea and Japan. Administration watchers say the disparity wasn't 
accidental, however: Baker, who is senior to Brady, grabbed trips to those 
capitals from which the United States had advance assurances that the 
governments were willing to contribute big.

PIECES OF A WORLD GONE BY LIVE ON IN MILLICAN, ORE. A RETIREE SAYS HIS PURCHASE 
WON'T CHANGE A THING.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The population here in high-desert Millican has doubled during the last 
half-century, from one to two. That's people. 
</P>
<P>
But the city park has stayed the same -- a 20-by-30-foot patch with a lone 
juniper throwing shade over a single picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
The gas pumps haven't been updated in decades. Inside the Millican Store, you 
can sip a cup of coffee made from water from an old well or grab a cold drink 
out of a wood-and-glass walk-in cooler, plop down at the card table and 
contemplate how the place is to resist the blistering and bewildering pace of 
change in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Which is just as Millican's new owner insists it be. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of place is an endangered species, probably more than any spotted 
owl," says Erle Cooper, a retired Alaska businessman and the latest of half a 
dozen or so men to hold deed to this bit of gas-stop Western history that needs 
no brass marker on the wall to pronounce its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just something about the place. Call it character," Cooper said. He 
shows a stranger around the sagging, creaking buildings that have been nailed 
and mortared together over the passing seasons to make up this artifact of a 
so-called town, half an hour east of Bend, just about smack in the center of 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are other dried-up stagecoach towns in the rural West. There are 
even a couple for sale farther down the road from Millican. But how many of 
them have a vest-pocket city park? How many of them are 110 years old? How many 
of them refused the demands of the brand-name oil franchisers to build big 
awnings over the pumps? How many have murder in their past? 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and his wife, Virginia, bought the place last February. The last 
longtime owner, Bill Mellin, was found slain on the property two years ago. A 
drifter who was working at the store was convicted of the killing. For a long 
time, Mellin's heirs couldn't sell the place. One look at the books and you 
could tell nobody could make a living and pay off a loan on the property from 
the small trickle of motorists passing on the two-lane highway or the 
hang-gliding enthusiasts who come to the Millican Valley to ride its famous 
thermals. 
</P>
<P>
You needed someone like Cooper, with the money from a trucking and boating 
business in Homer, Alaska, to buy Millican. And you needed someone with a will 
to fix it up, but not so you could notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I didn't want. I didn't want a . . . well, I didn't want a 
7-Eleven," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
The post office and telephone company do not recognize Millican as an official 
town. But the state of Oregon does, and it appears on maps and highway signs. 
</P>
<P>
When they first moved from Alaska to Oregon, the Coopers bought a house in a 
larger community over the hill from Millican, so they don't qualify as its 
residents. That honor goes to Russ and Margie Haley, who heard the Coopers were 
looking for someone to live at the store and run the business. They were happy 
to flee the urban pressures of Bend, population 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Haleys represent a 100% jump in population since 1930, when a 
previous owner, Bill Rabin, posed for a photograph with a sign that said: 
"Millican, elevation 4252, pop. 1." 
</P>
<P>
So with all this new blood and vitality, Millican seems ready to prosper still 
more while spitting in the face of modern change. Cowboys still buy their 
prepared sandwiches out of the cooler, walk into the room in the store, sit on 
a couch and call it dinner. A cross-country bicyclist naps on a chaise lounge 
in the park and calls it relief from peddling through the dry winds blowing 
soundlessly across 30 miles of sagebrush and scrub trees. A sign welcomes you 
to use the restrooms whether you buy anything or not. 
</P>
<P>
A guest book shows that passers-by from as far away as Paris and Tokyo were 
curious enough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place they can get the feeling of an America outside the big cities. 
And what can you tell about a place from its big cities, anyway?" Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the West without a lot of changes. This is where they can see the end 
of an era."

EXILED KUWAITI PRINCESSES DESCRIBE FLEEING PALACE, 'LIVING IN LIMBO';

ESCAPE: AFTER RECEIVING A FRANTIC PHONE CALL, MEMBERS OF ROYAL FAMILY LEAVE 
JUST AHEAD OF THE IRAQIS.

The phone call came to the royal palace in Kuwait city just before 4:30 a.m. It 
was Princess Mariam Saad al Sabah's brother-in-law. "You have to leave the 
palace. Go to the summer house," he said when she reached over to her bedside 
table and picked up the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no time to say why," she recalls. "All I knew was, he is a calm person, 
and at that time his voice wasn't calm. We left." 
</P>
<P>
Princess Mariam and her sister, Sheikha Saad al Sabah, the daughters of Kuwaiti 
Crown Prince Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, for the first time this past weekend 
told about the morning they fled for their lives from Kuwait city just before 
invading Iraqi troops stormed the two royal palaces. 
</P>
<P>
With their cousin and her two infants, the three women huddled in a royal beach 
house until Iraqi troops stormed a military base right next door. Then they 
made a dash for the Saudi Arabian border -- and a life in exile. 
</P>
<P>
"My life will start again the day I go back to Kuwait. I can't think beyond 
that. My country is occupied," Princess Sheikha, clad in gold exercise pants 
and a T-shirt, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in limbo. Right now, it's limbo. We're neither up nor down. I 
don't even know where my husband is," said their cousin, Barah al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
For the three women, raised in the heart of the royal family in the tiny, 
oil-rich emirate, the prospect of Iraqi troops massing north of Kuwait's 
borders throughout the month of July was something impossible to think of as a 
threat. Kuwait, said Barah, had supported Iraq for years, helping to finance 
its eight-year war with Iran and regarding its northern neighbor as an ally. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an Islamic saying," she said: 'My sister and I against a cousin, and 
my cousin and I against a foreigner. We supported him (Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein) with everything.' 
</P>
<P>
On the night before the Aug. 2 invasion, Sheikha had dinner with her father, 
the crown prince, after he had returned from failed negotiations with the 
Iraqis in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him about the meeting. I had seen the papers about the massing of 
troops, and I wondered if they might do something, and my father said, 'Never. 
Never." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, the crown prince got called out to a meeting at the 
Defense Ministry, but Sheikha, confident that all was well, went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Mariam had gone out to visit friends that night, but came back to the palace, 
watched a little television, and fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
When the phone call came at 4:30 a.m., Mariam pulled on the slacks she'd left 
hanging over a chair while Sheikha telephoned Barah and said they would be 
right over to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
Barah said she packed up some bottles for her two daughters, one a little over 
2 years old, the other 5 months, while her husband pulled his gun out of a 
dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
When the two princesses arrived, the family piled into the car with them and 
drove over to pick up Barah's mother. Then all of them headed south to the 
royal beach house at Jelaha, directly adjacent to a Kuwaiti naval base, a place 
the family felt sure they'd be safe. 
</P>
<P>
But the fighting had already reached the base by the time they arrived. The 
sound of explosions was rattling the windows of the cottage, and looking out 
the picture window over the Persian Gulf, the three women saw a Kuwaiti missile 
strike an Iraqi helicopter hovering over the water, sending the vehicle in 
flaming pieces down into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"All we knew up to that point was the Iraqis are coming, OK. For what? For a 
border clash? To attack the palaces and then they can bring us back this 
evening?" Barah recalled. "But after seeing that helicopter, we looked at each 
other and we said, 'It's bigger than we can even imagine.' " 
</P>
<P>
They had been at the beach house only about 15 minutes when another phone call 
came, ordering them to make a rush for the Saudi border. A minivan drove up 
near the door, and the entire family filed in -- except for Barah's husband, 
who stayed behind. She has not seen him since. 
</P>
<P>
All the way along the two-hour drive south, the three women said, there was 
mostly shocked silence in the van -- silence except for the tears of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"It broke my heart," Barah said, tears streaming down her face. "My oldest 
daughter was on my lap and holding onto me and crying, saying 'Mommy, please 
don't cry, please don't cry' and wiping away my tears -- while she's crying." 
</P>
<P>
The family, with no passports, no identification, waited about an hour at the 
border while the paperwork was completed. Then they were ushered to a hotel in 
Dammam, Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of Kuwaiti refugees began streaming in 
over the next several days. Later, they were moved to the Saudi royal family's 
official refuge in the mountain resort of Taif -- to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" said Barah. "I have two little girls. The future looks -- 
well, I believe in God, and I believe in our fate. And I also believe that we 
are going to go back. Without a shadow of a doubt, we're going to go back. It's 
just how, and when." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we will get it back," said Mariam. "I have never had the smallest 
thought that I would not see Kuwait again. Kuwait belongs to the Kuwaitis, 
forever. It will come to return to us. Of course." 
</P>
<P>
At a later news conference, the women called on the United States and the 
Soviet Union to put pressure on Iraq to allow the Red Cross and other 
international relief organizations to work in Iraq to help alleviate suffering 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Barah urged the superpowers to "take military action now, if that's the only 
way" to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic sanctions will take a long time, and time is not in our favor," she 
said. "People are starving. People are dying." Asked about the deaths that 
would result from military action, she said: "If this is the price we have to 
pay, we are ready to pay it. We didn't ask for this aggression. . . . If the 
price we have to pay is by blood, then we will pay it."

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared 
unconditional support for sanctions against Iraq and warned that if current 
steps fail, they are "prepared to take additional ones. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
During the Helsinki summit, Bush endorsed a Gorbachev stance that certain food 
and medical supplies could be exempt from the embargo. He also indicated that 
he will ask Congress to approve maximum possible economic assistance for the 
Soviet Union -- possibly including most-favored-nation status. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, Iraq's Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz began talks with Iranian 
officials in the first official Iraqi visit since the two countries went to war 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The visit is expected to pave the way for a peace treaty, and Iraq is expected 
to ask for food and medical shipments through Iran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Naval commanders from 20 nations met in Bahrain to coordinate operations of the 
huge armada of warships enforcing the embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a general coordination conference on radio frequencies and operating 
areas," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six French combat helicopters and 100 soldiers began heading for 
Saudi Arabia. France has deployed more than 7,000 men in the gulf region, most 
of them aboard warships. 
</P>
<P>
The Airlifts: 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Americans flew to freedom after being held in Iraq and Kuwait. A 
U.S.-chartered flight carrying about 300 Americans landed in Charleston, S.C., 
from Amman, Jordan. And an Iraqi Airways jumbo jet carrying 426 evacuees, 
including 170 Americans, flew from Baghdad to London. 
</P>
<P>
And an airlift by the International Migration Organization continued over the 
weekend. The plan is to fly 19,000 Sri Lankans home over the next 11 days.

HOSTAGES: FORMER 'GUESTS' OF IRAQ LAND ON AMERICAN SOIL, SOME ANXIOUS TO TALK, 
OTHERS BITTER OR RESERVED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women and children -- and a greater than expected number of men -- landed on 
American soil Sunday, bringing an end to their mixed bag of war stories, 
clandestine desert treks and, finally, an unhappy deliverance from 
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Three hundred and five Americans arrived here about 6:15 p.m., becoming the 
first of the former hostages to leave Kuwait on U.S.-chartered flights that 
brought Westerners from the war-torn Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
While their stories of fear and near misses preceded them to the United States, 
many of the returning Americans were reluctant to talk with reporters about 
their experiences. Though they were freed by State Department officials to say 
whatever they pleased after clearing the airport customs checkpoint, most 
quickly brushed past a corridor of reporters without comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of the returnees were anxious to talk, detailing the horrors they 
had seen and lived for the last month in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Though many were careful not to draw specific attention to individuals still in 
Kuwait, they provided additional details about resistance forces operating 
within the embattled country. They also talked of food shortages, lack of 
medical facilities and violent acts by Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the returnees, like Barbara Hoffman of McKinney, Tex., were anxious to 
talk -- or to express anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to leave my husband standing alone," she said, declining to offer her 
husband's name or occupation because he remains hiding in Kuwait. "We'd been in 
hiding for five weeks" before Iraqi officials allowed her to leave, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said she was particularly worried about her husband because he is 
suffering from a heart condition and has no access to medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to a hospital in Kuwait and you might as well be signing your death 
warrant," she said. "If you have an illness there, you're gone." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she could not explain why the Iraqi forces had not detained her 
since they had "broken into our apartment building and took every American out 
of there. For some . . . reason they didn't take us. I don't know why; they 
just missed us." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman also had harsh words for Bush Administration officials, who she said 
did little to help free her husband. She said government officials told her 
that only women and children were being allowed to leave Kuwait, but there were 
"about a dozen men" on board the plane that left Kuwait. A relief official in 
South Carolina said there were about 20 men who arrived on the flight at the 
Charleston airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to call Jesse Jackson and ask him if he'll come and get my husband 
out," Hoffman said. "George Bush isn't getting him out." 
</P>
<P>
But Hoffman was the exception. Many of the other returnees praised government 
officials for their assistance but said embassy personnel seemed to be limited 
in what they could do. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nicholson of Boise, Ida., said she was overjoyed to see government 
officials, who did all they could to make her comfortable after she left 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hawkins of Dallas, one of the men on the rescue flight, said he 
successfully hitchhiked across the desert before making the flight. He said 
that after the invasion, Iraqi troops broke into his apartment and stole most 
of his belongings and detained him for awhile. He said he was able to escape by 
bribing the officials, and last Tuesday he started from Kuwait city, crossing 
the desert and entering Baghdad on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his ordeal, Hawkins said he would return to Kuwait if a legitimate 
government is returned to the nation. "There would have to be some sort of 
military presence there to stop this from happening again," he said. "If that 
were to happen, Americans would be highly regarded by the Kuwaiti people." 
</P>
<P>
The red, white and blue Northwest Orient 747 jet left Frankfurt, West Germany, 
Saturday. It was forced to make an unscheduled stop Sunday afternoon in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, after one of the women complained of chest pains and 
three children became ill, said Mike Brennan, a State Department official. None 
of the ailing passengers were identified. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan said the stricken woman and children were rushed to a Halifax hospital. 
The children, apparently all from one family, were accompanied by their mother, 
who also stayed in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Airways plane picked up the former hostages in Kuwait and flew them to 
Amman, with a brief stop in Baghdad for Iraqi officials to check exit visas. 
From Amman, Northwest Airlines carried the Americans to West Germany, on to 
Nova Scotia and, finally, to Charleston.

Firm Sues Late Artist's Wife Over Copyrights: Jennifer Dumas, the wife of the 
late artist Patrick Nagel, famous for his portraits of a striking woman with 
high cheekbones and long dark hair, was sued by Mirage Editions Inc., a Santa 
Monica firm that claims to hold the copyrights on a number of Nagel works. In 
the federal lawsuit, Mirage asserts that after Nagel died in 1984, Dumas gave 
the firm exclusive rights to produce and distribute a number of Nagel works 
under an agreement whereby she would receive a $200,000 advance on foreign 
sales of Nagel reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Dumas breached the long-term contract by entering into a separate 
agreement with a Japanese company, Gallery APJ, to publish and distribute in 
Japan a number of Nagel images for which Mirage holds the copyright. The suit 
said the Japanese firm has sold various reproductions, including a calender of 
Nagel works on which Mirage still holds the copyright. The suit seeks $100,000 
per infringed copyright and at least $1 million in punitive damages. (Case No. 
90-4803. Filed Sept. 6.)

20th Century Fox Sued Over 'Simpsons' Stuff: Legends of Entertainment Inc. sued 
20th Century Fox alleging it breached an agreement giving Legends the license 
to make school supplies using animated characters from "The Simpsons." The Los 
Angeles Superior Court lawsuit said 20th Century breached an August, 1989, 
agreement by declaring Legends had breached the agreement and canceling it 
without giving a required 10 days written notice. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said 20th Century began negotiating a new licensing agreement with 
another party in the last six months and repeatedly rejected art work Legends 
submitted for approval. The lawsuit seeks $75 million in damages and 
injunctions to bar 20th Century from negotiating a licensing agreement with 
another firm. (Case No. BC009833. Filed Sept. 6, 1990)

EXPORTS: PAMPERS HAVE SUCCEEDED BECAUSE PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CHANGED THEM TO

<P>
In a cramped neighborhood drugstore alongside a case of murky Oriental herb 
drinks sits a stack of large plastic packages bearing a face and logo familiar 
to millions of American parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Pam-pahs," as they are called in Japan -- Pampers diapers to U.S. consumers -- 
are one of those increasingly common species in Japan: an American product that 
not only sells, but sells well. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when polls show Americans growing restive with the onslaught of 
Japanese products and money in the United States, a trend is starting in the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
While IBM and McDonald's are the best-known examples of American products that 
have made it in Japan, so too have Domino's Pizza (with the same 30-minute 
delivery guarantee); Schick razor blades; Oreo cookies; Kodak film; M&amp;Ms; 
Nike shoes; Levi's blue jeans; Microsoft computer software; Haagen-Dazs ice 
cream, and McIlhenney Co. Tabasco sauce, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola makes more money selling soft drinks in Japan, including its 
made-for-Japan canned coffee and Oolong tea, than in the United States, 
according to analysts here. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the companies will say it has been easy. In fact, some recently have 
chosen to bail out, deterred by the high cost of operating here and the long 
time it takes to get established. 
</P>
<P>
But even U.S. trade negotiators acknowledge that it can be done. A composite 
study of a successful foreign firm prepared by the U.S. Embassy and used in 
recent trade talks concluded that foreigners can make it here, but "government 
regulations, lack of antitrust enforcement and traditional business practices 
combined to make this an extremely difficult and costly process." 
</P>
<P>
Pampers' experience here shows what it involves. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 
maker of the diaper, created the Japanese market for disposable diapers in 1977 
and then nearly lost it to more creative Japanese competitors a few years 
later. Now, after a costly redesign of business practices and the product 
itself, Pampers has become the single best-selling brand again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally different ballgame here," said Ronald G. Pearce, president of 
Procter &amp; Gamble Far East Inc. "It has been a rough and rocky road. But 
today, after many years of hard and expensive learning, we are a factor here." 
</P>
<P>
When Pampers arrived in Japan in 1977, it was virtually the only disposable 
diaper on the market. Japanese mothers, eager to shed the mess of washing cloth 
diapers, snapped them up. Pampers dominated the market for the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But the diapers were imported without modification from the United States, and 
they were not quite suited to Japanese consumer needs. Made entirely of pulp, 
they were bulky, which made them difficult to transport and then store in tiny 
Japanese apartments, and they often leaked, making them a nuisance to use at 
night or on outings. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, meanwhile, did what Japanese companies have done for years 
when shown a promising new development: They modified it and made it better. 
Working to come up with a more compact and absorbent diaper more to the liking 
of Japanese mothers, Japanese companies developed super-absorbent polymers, 
basically powders that sop up liquid and turn it into a gel. Instead of ending 
up with a wet, leaky diaper after four hours of use, they made a diaper that, 
in the box, was half the size of Pampers and, on the baby, absorbed liquids, 
leaving the child dry and less prone to diaper rash. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a better mousetrap. It just revolutionized the industry, and P&amp;G 
didn't see it coming," said Joy Walbert, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, the Japanese diaper brands -- "Moonies" and "Merries" -- had 
swept the market. By 1983, "Pampers was virtually driven out of business," 
acknowledged Pearce. The competition combined with other problems in P&amp;G's 
Japanese operation, he said, and "we actually came very close to joining the 
ranks, along with hundreds of foreign companies, who have failed to enter the 
Japanese market successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce declined to discuss the finances of Procter &amp; Gamble Far East. But 
it was clear by the mid-1980s that the company needed a major revamping, and 
not only in the diaper area. 
</P>
<P>
That meant better research about what Japan's quality-conscious consumers 
wanted. It also meant closer relationships with wholesalers and retailers, to 
make them feel part of the company and more loyal to the product. P&amp;G 
earlier had made inroads into Japan's complex distribution system; now it also 
began offering costly services unheard of in the United States but expected in 
Japan, such as 24-hour delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, though, it meant making a better product. In 1985, Procter 
&amp; Gamble came out with its own version of super-absorbent Pampers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so far behind, we just had to do it step by step," said Pearce. It was 
an expensive and time-consuming process of the sort that has convinced other 
foreign firms to not bother with the Japanese market. It also has produced a 
diaper that Americans living in Japan say is much softer and more compact -- 
better -- than U.S.-made Pampers. Today, according to Pearce, Pampers is the 
best-selling disposable diaper in Japan. Salomon's Walbert and other analysts 
estimate that it has about a 25% market share. P&amp;G has several other 
best-selling products here as well, including Japan's top-selling shampoo-rinse 
combination, a compact laundry detergent and, one of the hit products of the 
last year, Whisper sanitary napkins. According to Walbert, Whisper is so 
popular because P&amp;G did several years of market research, using test 
groups, and came up with a product tailored to the needs of Japanese women, 
such as having a wrapper that makes almost no noise when opened. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that P&amp;G's Japanese sales now exceed $1 billion, and 
Japan probably will soon replace Germany as the company's largest foreign 
market. An added benefit, according to Walbert, is that P&amp;G's huge Japanese 
competitors are now so busy defending their flanks that they have little time 
to challenge P&amp;G in the United States and other markets. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce said he believes that the Japanese market is not as closed as many 
critics have suggested. A company succeeds in Japan if it is willing to adapt, 
both its product and its way of doing business, and is willing to accept that 
it takes time and money to get established here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, it's different. We accepted those differences and 
found a way to break through," said Pearce. "You just can't roll out something 
here that worked in another country and expect it to sell." 
</P>
<P>
It can be a long and tiring process, he said, but "our experience has shown 
that the market was open enough for us to get in."

STATE'S NEW TAX-FREE BONDS MAY BE HARD TO GET; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: THE SECURITIES ARE GREAT FOR SUCH THINGS AS FINANCING A COLLEGE 
EDUCATION, BUT THE ISSUE WILL BE LIMITED.

<P>
The biggest problem that investors may face when considering California's 
latest tax-free, zero-coupon bond is whether they will be able to buy enough of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, state Treasurer Thomas Hayes announced the "College Savers Program," 
the keystone of which is a $10-million to $20-million bond issue to refinance 
the life sciences building at the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds, which will be sold Oct. 24, are expected to bear interest rates 
ranging from 7.25% to 7.50%, depending on their maturity. (They'll be issued 
with maturities ranging from 10 to 15 years.) Since the bonds are exempt from 
both federal and state income taxes, the effective yield for high-income 
taxpayers is near 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Better still, the treasurer's office plans to issue the bonds in unusually 
small denominations. Face values would go as low as $1,000, compared to a 
minimum of $5,000 for similar bonds. And since zero-coupon bonds sell at a 
steep discount to face value because interest is paid only at maturity, 
investors could buy one of the bonds for as little as $331, the treasurer 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them Grandpa and Grandma bonds because they make such good gifts," 
said Zane B. Mann, publisher of California Municipal Bond Advisor, a Palm 
Springs-based newsletter. "It's a good way to accrue a substantial amount of 
money tax-free with very little cost up front." 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly a need for a low-cost vehicle to finance future college 
expenses, which have been appreciating substantially faster than the rate of 
inflation for several years. College expenses increased an average of 9.8% a 
year during the 1980s, compared to an average inflation rate of 5.3% in the 
same period, according to the College Board and the investment research firm 
Ibbotson Associates. 
</P>
<P>
When all expenses -- tuition, fees, room and board -- are factored in, it costs 
an average of $14,300 annually to send a child to college. By the year 2010, 
the College Board estimates, it will cost more than $92,000 a year -- an amount 
that's clearly out of reach for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But the College Savers bonds are not just for students. Hayes maintains that 
there is no restriction on how investors use the money once the bond has 
matured, so investors can use College Savers bonds to save for retirement or 
any other future expense. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bonds are backed by the State of California, which makes them 
extremely good credits. (Similar bonds issued by the state are rated AA by 
Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the highest ratings available.) 
</P>
<P>
If the state defaulted, the university system would also be on the hook to pay 
principal and interest to investors, said Manuel M. Mateo, chief of the trust 
services division at the state treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely safe credit," Mateo added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, over the past several years, both the stock market and the California 
real estate market have returned substantially more than 11% a year after 
taxes. In 1989, broad measures of stock market performance indicated that 
investors would have earned about 32%. Those dabbling in real estate in the 
late 1980s often raked in 30% annual returns as well. 
</P>
<P>
"On a historical basis, the stock market has outperformed the bond market," 
allowed Marilyn Cohen, president of Capital Insight, a Beverly Hills-based 
brokerage. "But I think the lofty rates of return we saw in the 1980s will not 
be repeated in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
If current stock market performance is any indication of the rest of the 
decade, Cohen is a master at understatement. The Dow Jones industrial average, 
a key indicator of stock market performance, has slid nearly 5% since the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate market is in a similar predicament. The California Assn. of 
Realtors estimates that real estate prices will rise less than 2% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, real estate and corporate stocks are not the only options. Investors 
can also put their money in commodities such as oil and gold; collectibles, 
such as coins and stamps, and other types of securities, such as junk bonds. 
However, all of these markets have proven to have pitfalls, such as extreme 
volatility -- gold prices dropped $27 in just one recent trading day -- or 
extreme risks. 
</P>
<P>
The price of zero-coupon bonds can also be volatile. But if investors buy them 
with the intention of holding them to maturity, the state of California is 
willing to guarantee investors a market rate of return, tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
The one hitch is that the bonds may be hard to find. There is a very small 
profit margin on selling this type of bond, and brokers might even lose money 
if they sell them in small denominations, Mann said. That could limit the 
number of firms willing to sell College Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the treasurer expects to sell a maximum of $20 million worth of the 
bonds on Oct. 24 and a total of $80 million in the whole program, which will 
encompass several future bond offerings, Mateo said. That's a minuscule amount 
compared to annual college expenditures in California, and Cohen believes that 
it will also prove to cover only a fraction of the demand for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BOTTOM LINE ON BONDS 
</P>
<P>
The College Savers Program is designed to help parents provide a college 
education for their children. Some background: 
</P>
<P>
* By the year 2010, the College Board estimates, college education will cost 
more than $92,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
* California's new tax-free zero-coupon bonds, which will be sold Oct. 24, are 
expected to bear interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.50%, depending on their 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
* The price of zero-coupon bonds can be volatile. But if held to maturity, 
California guarantees investors a market rate of return, tax-free.

FIRST PERSON: MOM, WILL ANYONE IN MY CLASS LOOK LIKE ME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with more than a typical parent's trepidation that I will send my 
firstborn off to begin kindergarten Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
I've done all the right things to get my daughter ready. After two years of 
preschool, she can write with a pencil and cut with scissors. She knows how to 
spell her name, recite her address and phone number, and write the alphabet and 
numbers to 100. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one thing I can't prepare her for: The possibility that school will 
bring her problems unrelated to her academic abilities; pain that stems from 
the role we've foisted on her by making her the lone black child in a sea of 
white faces. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all her life, she has been the only black child in her class or play 
group in our suburban San Fernando Valley neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But that was more my problem than hers. It bothered me that she stood out so, 
that some other parents seemed to take such pains either to ignore her or to 
praise her effusively. 
</P>
<P>
She, however, romped through her preschool years mostly oblivious to the 
differences between her and her classmates. The closest she came to 
encountering prejudice was when a little boy made fun of her hairstyle -- her 
two braided ponytails in a class rife with long, flowing, blond locks -- and 
made her cry. 
</P>
<P>
But come Tuesday, I'll walk her the three blocks to our local public school -- 
once called a "country club school," when it held only the children of white, 
upper middle-class, Porter Ranch families. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of that walk, she will leave the cloistered, protected environment 
we've managed to maintain for her and enter the real world. 
</P>
<P>
And as a black woman living and working in that white world, I know too well 
the pain she is likely to encounter. 
</P>
<P>
I see it everywhere I look. 
</P>
<P>
In the neighbors who decline to send their children to the local school, 
telling me, "There are too many minorities bused in." And in the nice, young 
mother at the kindergarten open house who looked at me incredulously when I was 
introduced. "And you live in this neighborhood?" 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, while half the school's students are white, almost all its black 
and Latino children are bused in from overcrowded neighborhoods in 
South-Central Los Angeles. And there are few black families living in our 
neighborhood. But those facts don't explain the assumption that we don't 
belong. 
</P>
<P>
As a Times education writer, I've written enough about schools to know some of 
what awaits my daughter. I've seen the way children segregate themselves by 
race on the playground and in the lunchroom. I've read the studies that show 
teachers expect less of their black and Latino students, and that those 
children, consequently, fare much worse in school than their white classmates. 
</P>
<P>
I worry about insensitive teachers, ill-mannered classmates and even the 
innocent curiosity of her young peers who might never have known a black child. 
And I worry that, already, my little Alyssa worries. 
</P>
<P>
As we lay in her bed, after I'd read to her the Berenstain Bears' "Trouble at 
School," Alyssa asked me one night not long ago: "Mommy, when I go to 
kindergarten, will there be anyone in my class who looks like me?" 
</P>
<P>
I looked at her, with her honey-brown skin, chestnut hair and her solemn, 
dark-eyed gaze. "Nope," I said, wrapping my arm around her and pulling her 
closer to me. "There won't be anyone as pretty as you." 
</P>
<P>
She persisted: "But will there be anyone who's brown like me?" 
</P>
<P>
She still struggles with the notion that we're black. African-American, she 
understands. Our ancestors came here from Africa, just as her friend Megan's 
came from Ireland and her friend Stacey's came from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But when she talks about our color, she speaks literally, looking from her baby 
sister's dark brown skin to mine and her father's, and pronouncing us all 
brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Will I be the only one this time?" she wonders, no doubt recalling preschool, 
gymnastics, ballet, swimming . . . all the places where she looked around and 
found no other brown faces like hers. 
</P>
<P>
I squeeze my eyes shut to keep the tears from spilling out. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband and I moved to our tract home on a quiet Northridge cul-de-sac 
four years ago, we knew what we were leaving behind -- neighborhoods racked by 
crime, plagued by overcrowded schools, and surrounded by decaying business and 
retail districts. 
</P>
<P>
What we didn't know is what we were coming to -- that here, in spite of all the 
advantages of suburban living, we would have to face a different kind of 
ugliness. 
</P>
<P>
It pains me to read about the 15-year-old black cheerleader in Orange County 
who was beaten almost beyond recognition, reportedly by club-wielding white 
youths yelling racial epithets. And the black couple in Agoura who have endured 
attack after attack on their home, replete with spray-painted swastikas and 
racial slurs. I hurt for those people, and I worry whether that kind of hate 
will spill over and touch my own family. 
</P>
<P>
So far, our life in suburbia has been happy. Alyssa's world has been safe and 
comfortable, gently circumscribed by her father and me. We choose her friends 
carefully and filter what she learns about the world. We think we've taught her 
to appreciate its diversity and to be proud of her dark skin and the heritage 
it represents. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm afraid that when she enters public school, she'll learn lessons other 
than 2 + 2 equals 4. She'll learn that there are people in this world -- in her 
own neighborhood and in her own classroom -- who believe she doesn't belong, 
that think she's less worthy, less capable, less deserving than they are. She 
will see there are people who will label her by skin color and make her the 
outsider, doomed to be defined only by her differentness. 
</P>
<P>
How do I prepare her to cope, to continue believing in herself? Is it enough 
merely to answer her questions as they arise? Or should I arm her, put her on 
the offensive, and prepare her to blunt the attacks that might never even come? 
Am I seeing bogey men that don't exist? 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, which is the bigger risk: Destroying my daughter's innocence 
to protect her from the racism I expect her to encounter, or sending her 
blithely out into that big, mean world with only her sweet innocence as a 
shield, and hoping she blossoms like the flowers that survive in our polluted 
air? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder and worry, but I have no answers. Right now, like my daughter, I have 
only questions.

SHORT FUTURE FOR FUTURISTIC COFFEE SHOP?; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: ALTHOUGH THE WICHSTAND WAS GRANTED HISTORIC LANDMARK STATUS BY 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY, THE GOOGIE-STYLE BUILDING MAY STILL FACE THE WRECKING BALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1957, Jackie Robinson retired from baseball, Humphrey Bogart died of cancer, 
Ford launched the Edsel and the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, black students 
were barred from Little Rock's Central High by the Arkansas National Guard, and 
the Wichstand coffee shop opened on Slauson Avenue in Windsor Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Wichstand's sweeping roof design reflected the essential buoyancy of the 
1950s, despite the era's mixed signals about the future. Its design matched the 
boisterous Chrysler Imperials, the Buick LeSabres and the upswept tail fins of 
contemporary Cadillacs that trumpeted America's post-World War II confidence 
that the sky was the limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wichstand captured the anti-gravity architecture of the Atomic Age," wrote 
architectural historian Alan Hess in his book "Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop 
Architecture." "Through its tilting roof plunges a large slanting dart . . . 
(and) only the momentum of the Space Age seems to hold it in place." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview Hess stressed his opinion that the Wichstand is "one of 
the finest designs we have left among the remaining 1950s coffee shops." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Wichstand, a unique example of the 1950s coffee shop style known as 
"Googie," is threatened with demolition. Closed for two years, it faces the 
possibility of being replaced by yet another faceless mini-mall, following the 
fate of other 1950s coffee shops, such as Westwood's beloved Ship's, demolished 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The county of Los Angeles granted the Wichstand historic landmark status in 
March, 1989. However, this status can only delay, not prevent, the owners, 
Shilyco Inc. of Century City, from developing the property as a potential strip 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Shilyco, which is offering the site for sale, has filed an application for the 
Wichstand's demolition. Because of the building's historic landmark 
designation, the county must delay permission for demolition for six months to 
give any interested parties a chance to find ways to save it. This grace period 
is already more than half over. 
</P>
<P>
The application for historic status, submitted to the L.A. County Landmarks 
Commission by a group of concerned individuals before the coffee shop finally 
closed its doors in late 1988, pleaded for its protection as "the best 
remaining example of postwar roadside architecture in the unincorporated area 
of Los Angeles County, and one of the few remaining excellent examples in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The Wichstand is unique because it is the only known coffee shop to include a 
cocktail lounge and carhop service in its parking lot. Designed by Los Angeles 
architects Armet &amp; Davis, who also created the late, lamented Schwab's 
Drugstore on Sunset Boulevard, the Wichstand embodies all the unself-conscious 
verve of its era. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-foot "slanting dart" Hess describes is the Wichstand's illuminated pylon 
sign. Resembling a rocket ready for launching, the pylon is stayed by guy wires 
that anchor it precariously to the earth. 
</P>
<P>
The blue roof fascia undulates weightlessly over the glass walls below. 
Rectangular light boxes stuck to the fascia were once dotted with plastic 
stars. Posters advertised "Fresh Eggs with Trout Jelly" and other such 
fast-food delights, and carhops scurried across the parking lot balancing 
trays. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the coffee shop curving booths and a boomerang-shaped counter made all 
the surfaces seem fluid. Bright spotlights, lightweight metal tables and chairs 
and floating circles of painted canvas gave a festive air, as if life were one 
long outdoor barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
To give some substance to the structure, the architects added stone piers, 
metal I-beams with circle cutouts, and fragments of solid wall. The cocktail 
lounge, a dark space in the rear, was a refuge from all this brightness. Yucca 
plants and palms added a tropical air. 
</P>
<P>
Put all together, the architecture created a large advertisement for the 
Wichstand. 
</P>
<P>
"The coffee shops of the period had an overriding aim -- to capture the eye of 
passing drivers with as much zooty verve as possible," Hess said. "They were 
three-dimensional billboards, using powerful design gestures, lighting and 
color to punch home their message." 
</P>
<P>
Coffee shop design drew its inspiration from many often disparate sources. Its 
mannerisms mixed the hotly emotional elements of Frank Lloyd Wright's "organic" 
architecture, which favored the use of natural materials like stone, with 
Bauhaus Modernism's predilection for cool, smooth surfaces. To this heady style 
blend was added details from popular U.S. roadside diners and Las Vegas neon 
extravaganzas, jazzed up by images derived from Space Age rocketry. 
</P>
<P>
The effect was often wonderfully weird. In many a Tiny Naylor's, Norm's, 
Ship's, Ben Frank's, Coffee Dan's and Googie's futuristic architectures of 
neon, steel, plastic and glass sprouted in beds of primeval cactus among 
rough-hewn rockeries. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee shop designers were clearly gifted. Armet and Davis, Stanley Mestim, 
Wayne McAllister and Martin Stern, among others, created a popular architecture 
that was purely American in its confidence in a techno future unencumbered by 
history or elite (read European) notions of taste. 
</P>
<P>
The connection of this "low art" style with the "high art" architecture of the 
period, which was also the heyday of the Case Study House program sponsored by 
Art &amp; Architecture magazine, was both direct and tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
While coffee shop designers were clearly inspired by such Case Study Houses as 
the famous high-tech home designed by Charles and Ray Eames in the Pacific 
Palisades, few of the 1950s leading avant-garde architects in Los Angeles 
condescended to create coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
John Lautner was a notable exception. The architect of the dramatic Chemosphere 
House in the Hollywood Hills also designed the first Googie's in 1949 alongside 
Schwab's Drugstore on Sunset Boulevard. Both designs reveal Lautner's 
fascination with both Frank Lloyd Wright and Space Age technology. 
</P>
<P>
The theme linking "low" and "high" architecture of the period was an urge to a 
direct kind of design Expressionism -- a sense that the building's shape and 
style should directly and dramatically express its structure and its function. 
</P>
<P>
Such dramatic Expressionism was as much a motivation for the Eames House design 
as for Googie's. It also made a strong showing in airport architecture, 
including Los Angeles International Airport's futuristic Theme Restaurant and 
Eero Saarinen's concrete "launching eagle" design for the TWA terminal and New 
York's Kennedy International. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Hess traces the genesis of this architectural Expressionism to 
several sources, including post-World War I German designer Erich Mendelsohn 
and 1920s Russian Constructivism. He also looks to the radically streamlined 
transcontinental trains of the 1930s and '40s designed by Americans Norman Bel 
Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss and Raymond Loewy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite is highly eclectic origins, coffee shop architecture is very much its 
own style, Hess said. "Googie design defies gravity. Walls vanish, planes curve 
and wrap around one another with a sense of weightlessness. The coffee shop 
manner is all flyaway energy, free of the Earth's inertia." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Googie aficionados hope that the Wichstand will not fly away into 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to lose this unique example of the style, that recalls an L.A. 
past more innocent and likable than the present," said Eugene Polk, a member of 
the Los Angeles Conservancy's Fifties Task Force, which campaigns for the 
preservation of period architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely an imaginative developer could find a way of recycling the Wichstand to 
appeal to our rapidly reviving interest in everything to do with the 1950s?" 
</P>

EDITING SAPS 'SUPERMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Look! It's a romantic comedy . . . it's a philosophical epic . . . it's "Man 
and Superman." 
</P>
<P>
George Bernard Shaw's ambitious hybrid can be presented as a mere play, minus 
the mighty "Don Juan in Hell" dream sequence in Act III. Or it can be staged as 
the complete Superplay -- which has been known to last five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Director Martin Benson, at South Coast Repertory, came up with a compromise: 
all four acts, including "Don Juan in Hell," edited down to a running time of 
about 3 hours, 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's version has its shining moments, but it's not up to the usual Shavian 
standard at South Coast, which has recently assembled impeccable renditions of 
two of Shaw's more manageable plays, "Misalliance" and "You Never Can Tell." 
</P>
<P>
The production gets most of its desired effects through the first three acts. 
But with only one intermission, even an abridged "Man and Superman" still 
requires a long sit, and the strain is felt in the final act. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic comedy plots seem surprisingly trivial and drawn-out by play's 
end. And the denouement of the main plot -- about the triangle between 
iconoclastic Jack Tanner, wily Ann Whitefield and moony Octavius Robinson -- 
feels oddly conventional (considering the unconventional notions of the 
playwright) and not particularly convincing. 
</P>
<P>
This feeling of fourth-act unrest may be partially attributable to the switch 
from the eternal concerns of the "Don Juan" sequence back to the temporal 
concerns of a few wealthy Victorians. But at South Coast, it's also due to the 
editing choices that went into effect even in the first act. 
</P>
<P>
Using a script that was reportedly prepared by Amlin Gray for a Berkeley 
production, this staging eliminates much of a first-act conversation between 
Jack and Ann, which explores the meaning of their mutual childhood experiences. 
This conversation is not just another example of entertaining repartee; it's an 
essential prelude to understanding Jack's and Ann's obsession with each other 
and the inevitability of their final embrace. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few other omitted lines that would add depth to this production. Of 
course they also would add length -- which might be more tolerable if the 
romantic comedy that surrounds "Don Juan" felt more substantive, or if the 
performance were broken into two events that could run in repertory. 
</P>
<P>
If the show must be presented in one night and further cuts are deemed 
necessary, the subplot about Octavius' resolute sister and her secret American 
husband could be more severely trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with trying to present the entire play intact is the sheer volume 
of words that would have to be memorized. Even in this mildly condensed 
version, there were a few bobbled lines on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
But these actors would probably be up to the challenge. John de Lancie 
maneuvers through Tanner's and Don Juan's speeches with elan, and he also 
brings an aristocratic bearing and distinctively insinuating body language to 
the role. Near the end, that body language is slightly overdone, but that was 
just one more symptom of the slow grinding of gears that afflicts that last 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Marnie Mosiman's Ann maintains her control of the action with a beautifully 
light touch. And as Dona Ana during the "Don Juan" sequence, it's Mosiman who 
sings a few bars of "Don Giovanni," in contrast with the men who usually do the 
honors -- a wise choice, considering the power of Mosiman's singing voice. 
</P>
<P>
Jarion Monroe is a funny lovesick brigand and an extremely suave devil, 
assisted by a glittery gold Playboy Mansion-style outfit designed by Shigeru 
Yaji. As Roebuck Ramsden/the Statue, blustery George Ede gets more mileage out 
of his eyebrows than any SCR actor since I.M. Hobson in the last two Shavian 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
The more John Walcutt's Octavius cries, the more laughs he gets. He cries a 
lot. Lynne Griffin plays his sister (superbly steely, but perhaps a bit old for 
the role), and Patricia Fraser, Don Sparks and David Anthony Smith lend fine 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Set designer Cliff Faulkner again uses puffy white clouds, as he did in "You 
Never Can Tell," but this time they cover a backdrop that curves down to the 
floor. They suggest the otherworldly aspect of "Don Juan in Hell," but they 
don't do much for the rest of the play. Sound designer Michael Roth's selection 
of Roy Orbison, Frank Sinatra and "Annie Get Your Gun" tunes add a few sly 
grace notes. 
</P>

...AND FOR THE (BLEEP) WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
TV used to be this pleasant, happy-family experience, a generally bloodless 
amusement. But change set in -- "The Untouchables," with submachine guns 
blasting across the screen, Elvis shaking himself in front of Ed Sullivan, the 
celebrated bigotry of Archie Bunker. 
</P>
<P>
Each new season brings new challenges to the old order. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, for example, the first line from the first episode of "Uncle Buck" (at 
8 p.m. on CBS) has a 6-year-old girl, Maizy, yelling at her 8-year-old brother, 
"Miles, you suck." 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon Gless returns to CBS next Monday as a public defender in "The 
Trials of Rosie O'Neill," her first spoken line is an earthy reference to 
having her breasts reformulated. 
</P>
<P>
The new Fox series "DEA" makes liberal use of a bleeper during its bad 
language. On "Against the Law," another new Fox series, one coming episode is 
about a comic who gets busted for raucous talk; it counts 36 bleeps during the 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
There may still be plenty of the Old Television left, but it's in the nature of 
the New Television to push boundaries -- and the pushing this season is what 
producers and executives keep calling "reality," including gritty language. It 
promises to pervade a gritty new season -- including the first hour of prime 
time when children make up a large part of the viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
Producers and network executives surveyed by The Times about the effort to deal 
with changing tastes attributed the experimentation this season to the 
increasingly fierce competition for viewers -- not only from the cable 
networks, which aren't constrained by federal regulations in matters of 
indelicate content, but also from the young and aggressive Fox Broadcasting, 
"Bart-net" (after Bart Simpson), which is producing nine new series this fall 
and expanding to five nights. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sascha Schneider, a producer on NBC's "Parenthood," said that "If we 
were at Fox, you could go, say, 20 degrees more toward the reality level, both 
with words and action." 
</P>
<P>
A philosophical Alan Gerson, vice president for program standards and broadcast 
policies at NBC, maintained that the changing standards should be seen as part 
of a continuum: "You don't get up in the morning and the world has changed," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Al Schneider, ABC's vice president for policy and standards, who's been at the 
network since the early '60s, agreed that there has been a verbal evolution 
"from 'hells' and 'damns' " (although they still draw complaints, he added). 
</P>
<P>
As for Maizy's word, "Well, to a person of my age, it has always been a 
vulgarity and disturbs me," he said. "But my children use it all the time. So 
in the context of their usage and their terms, it is not a vulgarity." 
</P>
<P>
In one frantic day-and-a-half last fall, Tim O'Donnell hit all four networks 
peddling the idea of a perky little TV series based on "Uncle Buck," the 
feature film about a slob uncle who raises his dead brother's three kids. All 
the networks were interested, but when CBS offered the best deal -- 13 episodes 
-- Universal Studios, which was funding the show, chose to make it there. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell was recalling last week that he used the words edgy and risky in his 
sales pitch. But little did he realize that those are the buzz words for the 
new television season and that "Uncle Buck" would become a legend before its 
own time period. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed puzzled by the furor: "I think 'Uncle Buck' is a very, very warm show 
about this big goofy guy who cares very deeply for these kids. That's the tone 
of the series, not 'sucks.' " 
</P>
<P>
For all the fussing and fuming over Maizy's line, the producer emphasized that 
in the very next line, Uncle Buck chastises her for her language. 
</P>
<P>
Critics counter that the laughter on the soundtrack in response to the opening 
line makes that language seem funny to child viewers. They also have complained 
about other language in the episode, including some sexual references between 
Uncle Buck and a woman, and further note that while the show is seen at 8 p.m. 
on the East and West coasts, it will air at 7 p.m. in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, O'Donnell, who has three children himself (17 to 21) and who 
toiled five years as a producer-writer on "Growing Pains," has won wholehearted 
public support from top CBS executives, and subsequent episodes reflect the 
raucous flavor of tonight's pilot. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the standards department permitted the Maizy line to go because it 
helped establish the characters and their relationship in a new show. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell noted that his co-executive producer, Richard Gurman, was supervising 
producer for three years on "Married . . . With Children." "They constantly got 
notes from Fox (saying) 'Can we make Al more likeable?' and 'Do we have to make 
Kelly such a slut?' . . . Well, if they'd taken those notes, that show would be 
a footnote instead of one of the big stories of the '80s and '90s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do 'Married . . . With Children,' " O'Donnell continued, "but 
I think America said loud and clear with 'Roseanne' that they were ready for 
that -- obnoxious kids, disrespectful kids, a mother who tells them to . . . 
off, a father who screws up his jobs and is talking about climbing into the 
sack with her. 
</P>
<P>
"America is not running from that; America is embracing that. They're 
recognizing that as something they've seen before -- in real life, not on 
television. There's a message out there somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the pilot episode, which had been widely pre-screened by critics 
over the summer, Maizy tossed off a put-down line when her 16-year-old sister 
departed the house in a snit: "Don't mind her, she's ovulating." It also drew 
heavy criticism. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said out last week that even though the CBS brass was willing to let 
the whole pilot episode air, word for word, he changed the line voluntarily. He 
said that he preferred to end on what he thinks is a stronger and less 
complicated line -- "Hang on, it's going to be bumpy." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, third in the viewer ratings and resultingly more desperate, seems to be 
taking a softer position than ABC and NBC on harder language. Another case in 
point is the Sharon Gless series, which premieres next Monday night at 10 with 
a tight shot of the star speaking to her therapist. Her husband has left her 
and she's digging out of her morass. The premise of the series is she has quit 
corporate law in Beverly Hills in favor of down-and-dirty public defender duty 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
She blurts, "I'm thinking about having my tits done." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe, she goes on, she'll just get them "fluffed up." 
</P>
<P>
It was Gless' idea and her line for Rosie. "I think that's the way people 
talk," she told reporters this summer. "I could've said boobs but I think 
that's a silly word." 
</P>
<P>
CBS preferred the word boobs. Executive producer Barney Rosenzweig, who had 
fought word wars with the network during his years overseeing "Cagney &amp; 
Lacey," agreed, reluctantly, but wanted the network to see the original line 
anyway. He had the scene shot twice, each with a different word -- "And," he 
said with some amazement, "they called me back within hours and agreed to let 
tits run. They said it was much better." 
</P>
<P>
In another coming episode, CBS asked Rosenzweig to cut back on some of the 
"language." "I told them that I would cut out every potentially offensive 
word," he said, "if I can keep in two lines of dialogue in one scene." 
</P>
<P>
It involves Rosie and her office roommate, a black attorney, who have a 
relentlessly tense relationship. He screams that she isn't always going to have 
"nice" clients, that this isn't Beverly Hills. She calls him "an elitist son of 
a bitch"; he fires back, "Kiss my ass!" 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig said that CBS agreed to let him keep the dialogue in exchange for 
deleting the other curses. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trickier CBS moves, however, may be shuffling its spritely "Doctor, 
Doctor" from 10:30 p.m. Mondays to 8:30 p.m. Wednesdays, although executive 
producer Norman Steinberg claims that the journey isn't affecting the show "one 
bit from last year." 
</P>
<P>
The show just filmed one episode that might test the extremities. In it, Diedre 
is making love to her new Mr. Right in the cockpit of his plane on the way to 
Key West -- when suddenly he dies. The other doctors, who had been passengers 
in the back, rush to help and one suggests, "Gee, maybe we should pull his 
pants up." The other doctor observes, "That's like trying to put a ski mask on 
Pinocchio." Another line is tossed in: "My God, he must have told a very big 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another line, unprintable here, was improvised that Steinberg figures 
"won't go . . . but I think the Pinocchio (comment) is a very funny line and 
worth fighting for." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Finkelstein, who was supervising producer of "L.A. Law" on NBC and now is 
co-creator and supervising producer of "Cop Rock" on ABC, seems particularly 
unbent by the fear of getting caught in the blenders of standards departments: 
"What I just rail against is the prevailing climate and this very fearstruck 
way in which the advertisers and everybody else by extension operates." 
</P>
<P>
If a difficult word serves the drama, "that's all the justification you should 
have for using it." 
</P>
<P>
He went on: "Part of what offends me the most about this is that we're not 
little children who like scrawling swear words on a fence. We're not doing 
these things because we just feel like . . . people off." 
</P>
<P>
In one "L.A. Law" courtroom scene, an angered Victor Fuentes used a vulgarism 
for urinating that also had direct reference to the lawsuit. Finkelstein 
recalled that the network offered such alternative words as tinkle or whiz. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, he's mad, he's angry! Why would he say something like that? It was 
really integral to the drama of the scene and to what the character was going 
through. I mean, it did all the things a word is supposed to do! 
</P>
<P>
"When you're forced into euphemisms that render your character unbelievable or 
that make what you're doing -- your drama -- less compelling, to me, everybody 
loses in that. People who are offended by frank language should choose their 
viewing fare accordingly."

Galindo: A No-Show 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran poet David Escobar Galindo, who was to have read in the festival's 
"La Terra Nova 1990: Pacific Poetry Festival" today, will not appear in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"He canceled -- I was sick. It was shocking," said Florinda Mintz, co-curator 
of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo's selection for the festival caused much furor in the local Salvadoran 
community last month. After much discussion, the festival added a leftist poet 
to the program to balance with Galindo's alleged right-wing politics. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said she went to the airport Friday to meet Galindo, who did not arrive 
on his scheduled flight. She then called him, and he told her he could not 
appear in the festival because a Salvadoran peace talk -- at which he will 
represent the country's government -- was moved ahead from Sept. 20 to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt it was too complicated to come here and that he wouldn't be prepared 
for the peace talk if he did," Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the late cancellation, Mintz said no replacement would be made for 
Galindo. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Videos Continue 
</P>
<P>
"Stretching the Canvas," the Fellows of Contemporary Art's one-hour program of 
videos on contemporary California artists, including Lita Albuquerque and Betye 
and Alison Saar, continues through Sept. 17 on 14 local cable stations. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by festival director Peter Sellars, the program looks at artists who are 
seen to "stretch the boundaries of traditional art." 
</P>
<P>
Videos include "Altering Discourse: The Works of Helen and Newton Harrison," 
"Similar Differences: Betye and Alison Saar," "Drawing in the Source: Lita 
Albuquerque," and "Red Is Green: Jud Fine." Also featured is "Los Angeles 
Murals," a survey of several local murals, their creation, upkeep and 
contribution to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The program is produced and directed by Joe Leonardi of the Long Beach Museum 
of Art Video Annex and is part of the Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Arts Addition 
</P>
<P>
A free program of martial arts -- what some might consider outside of the usual 
arts festival fare -- is being presented at the Palos Verdes Art Center on 
Saturday from 2-4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The "Asian Arts of Physical Culture" program will feature demonstrations of 
aikido, hapkido and t'ai chi ch'uan. In addition, the Rev. Kensho Furuya, a Zen 
priest who is chief instructor at the Aikido Center of Los Angeles, will 
demonstrate 16th-Century samurai swordsmanship (known as iaido). 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 541-2479. 
</P>

N. Palm Ave., Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned is an "open rehearsal" in the community room of the Alhambra Main 
Library (400 W. Main St.) on Wednesday at 7 p.m. for Theatre To Go's "Journeys: 
The Immigrants' Tale." Information: (818) 570-3242.

CHILDREN OF BALI AT SUNSET CANYON CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With flowing arm movements but with hands stretched rigid, fingers quivering, 
the Children of Bali made a ceremonial entrance down the middle of the sold-out 
audience seating area at the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, made up of dancers age 10-15, appeared dressed in simmering greens, 
golds and oranges, wearing golden aprons, peaked helmets or headdresses crowned 
with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
With eyes staring wide open or darting from side to side or lowered modestly, 
the dancers executed quick shifts between acute-angle poses, their neck 
movements gracefully transporting the head from side to side to signal the end 
of a dance phrase. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with a slow, graceful Rejang for six girls, and ended with a 
episode from the dance drama "Legong Keraton," in which the Prince of Lasem is 
threatened by the Bird of Ill Omen for attempting to seduce the Princess 
Langkesari. 
</P>
<P>
In between, two boys' solos exhibited a range of virtuosic purpose. In "Kebyar 
Duduk," 13-year-old Ida Bagus Putra Kenaka Wedana executed quicksilver moves 
and freezes, including a series of squatting turns. In "Baris Tunggal," 
12-year-old I Made Bagus Basuki Mahardika showed a young warrior exercising 
feints and attacks as preparation for battle. 
</P>
<P>
After the Children of Bali, audience members moved to the upper meadow to watch 
Larry Reed offer an heroic and humorous shadow play in Balinese and English 
involving characters from the "Mahabharata." Simultaneously, in the lower 
theater, the Uwanuda Kagura troupe from Japan was scheduled to offer a repeat 
of the previously reviewed "Yamata-no-oro-chi."CHRIS PASLES

It looked less like a Los Angeles Festival audience than a group of disaster 
refugees -- about 900 people carrying blankets, sleeping bags, futons, pillows, 
backpacks, picnic hampers and paper bags stuffed with food or clothing into the 
Los Angeles State and County Arboretum late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
On view: the only all-night Wayang Kulit (Javanese shadow-puppet) performance 
of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the spectators headed for the center bleachers; others sprawled on the 
lawn behind the outdoor platform stage or huddled on the front of the stage 
itself. Many wandered nomadically, comparing the shadow-screen illusion out 
front with the backstage reality of one man (Radyo Harsono) masterfully 
manipulating all the puppets, providing their voices and cuing the large 
percussion orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
This performance represented more than just an expansion of the previously 
reviewed two-hour version of "Arjuna's Wedding" by the Jogjakarta "Court Art of 
Java" company. By its nature, a shadow play seems dreamlike, a conjuring trick 
-- but played from 10 p.m. to5 a.m., it grows into something approaching a 
wondrous, shared hallucination. Shouldn't we envy a culture that teaches its 
history, literature and philosophy that way? 
</P>
<P>
An evolving sense of context also proved a major plus in the seven-hour 
marathon. Thirty minutes of speech (with virtually no puppet movement) 
introduced the drama, meticulously describing the ideal kingdom about to be 
placed in peril. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at about 2 a.m. Harsono sent in the clowns (three of them) for an 
hourlong scene that included playful, enlightening digressions on the 
characters' lives "at home" vs. the exotic customs "here." An invaluable 
adjunct to his insights and artistry: the simultaneous translation and 
commentary (via earphones) by R. Hardja Susilo.LEWIS SEGAL

UNEVEN TRIO OF SITCOMS FROM CBS, NBC

<P>
The curtain goes up on three new comedies tonight. Starting with the best and 
working downhill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Callahan needs money to help pay for his father's operation and is angry 
that he can't get a loan: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being rejected by S &amp; Ls run by convicted felons who steal from their 
own customers and then ask the government to bail 'em out with my tax dollars. 
Pardon me, but this is a load of crap that wouldn't fit in a Winnebago." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Shelly, wants to know if he means a full-sized Winnebago. 
</P>
<P>
All right! 
</P>
<P>
Starring comedian Lenny Clarke as a hardhat who moonlights as a doorman, 
"Lenny" is a somehow-enjoyable, rough-around-the-edges, loud-mouthed CBS comedy 
that sort of bullies its way into your heart. It premieres at 8:30 tonight 
(Channels 2 and 8), to return Sept. 19 in its regular 8 p.m. Wednesday time 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Get the earmuffs ready. I mean, this Lenny is just too noisy and intense to be 
endured for more than a few minutes, right? Actually, no -- he grows on you. 
And much of what he utters -- to his wife, kids, mother and father -- are 
monologues that epitomize the frustrations of working-class America. 
</P>
<P>
Although sometimes seeming to try too hard, Clarke is mostly terrific. Watching 
him work is like watching a burly bouncer snap off one-liners, and Lee 
Garlington is swell as his wryly humorous wife. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere is uneven, its laughs easily able to fit inside a Winnebago. 
However, Lenny has some very nice moments with his father (Eugene Roche), and 
his relationship with his slug of a brother (Peter Dobson) -- whose pouffed-up 
hair looks like it's held in place by Krazy Glue -- is just a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
Give this man a loan. This is a series with promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is being touted as a sure hit. If it becomes one, it 
will be because of the raw likability of its star, rapper Will Smith, not 
because of his acting skills or even anything that's been written for him in 
this NBC comedy that premieres at 8 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, gangly Smith (better known as Fresh Prince) plays a Philadelphia 
street kid named Wil who is packed off by his mother to live with a rich aunt 
and uncle in Bel Air. This is set up in the opening credits, which are longer 
than some series. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustment isn't easy. Right away, Wil can't tolerate the butler ("I will 
show you to your room, Master William"). But the big clash is with his snooty 
uncle (whose pretentious dinner party he is forced to attend) and his preppy 
and materialistic cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Street smarts triumph over upper crust, however. Soon, Wil is "maxin' and 
relaxin'," and you with him, all the while enjoying this charmingly irreverent 
guy a lot, even though the premiere is tainted by buffoonish caricatures of the 
rich and phony and a script that is only moderately amusing. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of the big three networks losing viewers to the brash programming on 
Fox. No more Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Buck," for example, is CBS' reply to the raunchiness of Fox's hit 
"Married . . . With Children." The trouble is that although "Uncle Buck" is not 
as boorish as "Married . . . With Children," it also is not nearly as funny. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Uncle Buck" is not funny at all. Even having a character named Mrs. 
Crappier doesn't make it funny. Premiering at 8 tonight on Channels 2 and 8, 
it's less a comedy than a slobedy, a gross sitcom-version of the John Candy 
movie about an irreverently snidecracking, slovenly hulk of a man who becomes 
the guardian of his nephew and two nieces. 
</P>
<P>
TV's Uncle Buck (Kevin Meaney) repeatedly blows cigar smoke into their faces. 
But it's CBS that's blowing smoke -- into the faces of viewers by even airing 
this half-hour of bilge, whose tone is set by these episode-opening words from 
6-year-old Maizy (Sarah Martinek): "Miles, you suck!" 
</P>
<P>
CBS says this is all right because 6-year-olds talk like this in real life, 
and, of course, its mission is to reflect reality. Uh huh. Soon after, Buck 
uproariously squirts mustard into his own face, meanwhile, it's time for, yes, 
the obligatory Tender Moment, when his essential goodness is revealed and we 
all reach for our hankies. 
</P>
<P>
To puke in.

DESPITE SUMMIT, IRAQIS PREPARING TO HOLD OUT; 
</P>
<P>
STANDOFF: IN AN EFFORT TO FORTIFY ITSELF AGAINST THE U.N. TRADE EMBARGO, THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO MOBILIZE FARMERS TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While superpower leaders met Sunday in cool Finland to press for Iraq's 
withdrawal from Kuwait, preparations were being made under Iraq's roasting 
desert sun to hold out against the tight international blockade and to defend 
the nation in case of war. 
</P>
<P>
The government made no official response to the joint statement of President 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their Helsinki summit. Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein had appealed urgently to Moscow on the eve of the 
summit to break ranks with the United States and a series of sanctions imposed 
by the United Nations and to take sides with Iraq in the Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Iraq seemed to be expecting no quick breakthrough in its favor. 
In one large-scale effort to fortify itself against the U.N. trade embargo, the 
government has begun to mobilize farmers to increase food production. Iraq had 
imported about 70% of the food it consumes. 
</P>
<P>
State land customarily rented to farmers will be leased without charge to 
anyone willing to work it, the government announced Sunday. Regional 
authorities in grain-growing areas have ordered farms to increase planting of 
winter wheat, and farmers have been exempted from military conscription. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic observers are skeptical about Iraq's ability to make a dent in its 
food needs, especially because of lack of fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation is another tactic. Government officials have gone out of their way 
to explain that the lengthening bread lines in Baghdad do not signify that 
wheat is running out. Rather, they say, rationing is a means of stretching out 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying to rationalize consumption," official spokesman Naji 
Hadithi said in understated bureaucratese. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television warned against hoarding or price gouging and assured 
Iraqis that food would be distributed evenly throughout the country. This may 
reflect snafus in bread rationing efforts that have led to shortages in some 
neighborhoods, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to tighten vigilance over its own citizens by 
telling them to register at local residency offices. There was speculation that 
the move was designed to head off draft dodging. 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping tabs on its own citizens, the government repeated warnings to 
foreign hostages not to try to escape on penalty of life imprisonment. If 
foreigners move from house to house, they must also notify residency officials. 
In August, Iraq warned its own citizens that harboring foreigners was 
tantamount to the crime of espionage and punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
The Draconian measures seemed mainly aimed at Kuwait, which Iraq claimed as 
annexed territory after its lightning Aug. 2 invasion. Foreigners, including 
scores of Americans, have been hiding out for fear of being rounded up and sent 
to military and industrial sites to be used as "human shields" against attack 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, mobilization into the Popular Army of reserve recruits continued, 
and anti-aircraft batteries popped up along the Tigris River, which bisects the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Hussein regime is sending out strong psychological signals that war is 
likely. Television is full of patriotic appearances by soldiers in training for 
the Popular Army. Prompted by reporters, the weekend warriors chant 
nationalistic slogans, sing regional songs and wave rifles. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a broadcast order prohibited the firing of weapons at weddings and 
other celebrations. In Iraq, it is common to greet the bride and groom with a 
volley of rifle fire; these nighttime events have sometimes sent foreign 
reporters here scurrying into the streets in search of a coup. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign that Iraq was giving up on its claim to Kuwait. It is viewed 
as part and parcel of the country.

SOUTHLAND WILTS AS TEMPERATURES SOAR;

WEATHER: THE HEAT IS EXPECTED TO LAST AT LEAST THROUGH TUESDAY AS HIGH-PRESSURE

<P>
A high-pressure system that stalled over Southern California drove inland 
temperatures into the low 100s Sunday and made most other areas nearly as 
miserable, but not enough to set records. 
</P>
<P>
At Castaic Lake, two people apparently drowned in separate accidents, sheriff's 
deputies said. Sandra Delion, 13, of Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia at 12:54 p.m. She had been swimming 
with friends when she disappeared in about five feet of water, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 5 p.m. an unidentified man, who reportedly had drunk several 
beers with a friend, jumped from a rented rowboat to cool off and apparently 
drowned, deputies said. But searchers failed to recover the man's body. 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, riptides combined with moderate beach crowds to keep 
lifeguards busy. An unidentified woman drowned at Dockweiler State Beach while 
taking a pre-dawn swim alone. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon high of 99 at the Los Angeles Civic Center was three degrees 
short of the record 102 set in 1956, said Steve Burback, meteorologist for 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Santa Ana reported a high of 96 degrees. Although quite warm, 
it was well below the record 111 set in 1913, according to Jim Sleeper's Orange 
County Almanac. San Juan Capistrano had a 92 reading Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said there was nothing particularly unusual about the heat wave. The 
humidity, which has been high at times during the summer, was a relatively low 
21%. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place where it will be nice will be at the beaches," Burback said, 
adding that there is no relief in sight, at least until after Tuesday. "It's 
just plain hot." 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Rick Dempsey, behind the plate for the entire 
nine innings in Sunday's 6-4 victory over Cincinnati, it wasn't just hot, "it 
was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said it probably was the hottest game he has caught and he has played 
in parts of four decades. And there was no way to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
"You just get down and sweat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium organist Nancy Hefley did her best to help the sweltering crowd, 
playing "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow." 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona, no serious health problems were 
reported by fair-goers, possibly because air conditioning was installed in 
exhibit halls last year, said spokesman Sid Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 105 at 3 o'clock," Robinson reported. "People are finding cool places. 
Nobody's jumping in the ponds, but they're staying cool as best they can." 
</P>
<P>
Other high temperatures in the area Sunday included 108 at Ontario, 102 in 
Northridge and 100 in Newhall, according to WeatherData.

<P>
Little Latisha Brewer was born on a Tuesday night almost four weeks ago, seven 
hours after her father, a Marine Corps E-4 based at El Toro, shipped out to 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a week and a half would go by before Torrence Brewer even knew he had 
a daughter. In that first phone call he was allowed to make to his wife, 
Jackie, since he had left for Operation Desert Shield, he learned that his baby 
was born through a Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jackie Brewer spoke of coping while her husband is in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," she said. "The days, you can find things to take up your time. 
It's the nights. And things happen without him. Like the first time that she 
sucked her thumb, he wasn't there. He's missing a lot. And it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Brewer sat at a round table decorated with red, white and blue 
carnations, cradling her baby, surrounded by about 70 others gathered for the 
first meeting of a new support group for families of military personnel sent to 
Saudi Arabia. Some of them wore pictures of their sons or boyfriends pinned to 
their lapels. Others brought letters from them, or stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
The group was the idea of Kathy Collier of Buena Park, whose son Darrin, an 
Army private stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C., went to Saudi Arabia on Aug. 11. The 
large turnout at the meeting, Kathy Collier said, demonstrated the need that 
military families have to share stories and information with each other -- and 
also to talk of their fears and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's especially hard on the families whose loved ones have just left in the 
last two or three days," she said. "For weeks they have been hearing about 
this, knowing that they could be sent. All of a sudden, when it happens, and 
you get that phone call to tell you goodby, what do you do? I had a phone call 
from one woman whose husband was just sent off, and she said to me, 'I feel 
like I'm alone in this.' " 
</P>
<P>
They are not alone, she said, and together they can talk about how the 
political tensions half a world away have touched their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that our world situation had changed, and it involved our son 
Darrin," she said. "We've come together to share our concerns, our anxieties 
about what is going on in the gulf and with our loved ones." 
</P>
<P>
While those at Crescent Southern Baptist Church talked about family members who 
have gone to the Middle East, almost 200 Palestinians gathered at Fountain 
Valley's Mile Square Regional Park for a cultural festival. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the balloons, the folkloric dancing, the native food and the sounds of 
Arabic music, the talk at the park also was about the crisis in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very deep concern for what is happening in Kuwait," said Riyad 
Shalabi, a doctoral student at Cal State Long Beach, who lives in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, whose nation is locked in a battle with Israel to establish their 
own homeland, have much at stake in the Persian Gulf crisis. While most of the 
Arab leaders have condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat continues to support Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, although he 
has stopped short of condoning the invasion of Kuwait. Many Palestinians here 
say they also do not approve of the U.S. intervention in the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're against the occupation of any country by any government," Shalabi said. 
"We'd like to see no intervention by the United States. This is an internal 
Arab conflict that can be resolved by Arabs themselves." 
</P>
<P>
At the Crescent Southern Baptist Church, the pastor, John Jackson, talked to 
that gathering about how their loved ones were also now caught in the Arab 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray, more than anything else, that you bring a cessation of the possibility 
of hostility, that you help work it out, that you remove this pride problem of 
this dictator, that he returns Kuwait to its rightful leaders," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
And as he and others spoke, Brewer held her baby close. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told my husband about Latisha, he cried, and said I love you, and he 
said to give the baby a kiss for him," Brewer said, her eyes tearing. A former 
Marine herself, Brewer, 21, said she met her husband when they were both 
stationed at Parris Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, Claudia Nessary clutched a packet of 13 letters tied with a 
yellow ribbon. A photo of her husband, H.R. Nessary, a Marine stationed at Camp 
Pendleton, sat in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
Nessary, who lives in La Habra, wore a yellow ribbon in her hair. She said she 
writes letters to her husband three or four times a day. 
</P>
<P>
In his letters, he complained of how long it was taking for the enlisted 
personnel to get their mail and said he got 20 of her letters in one day. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for all your letters and your support that you have been giving me," he 
wrote her in one letter. "Sweetheart, you don't know how much all these letters 
mean to me in these crucial times." 
</P>
<P>
And in another letter, he told her: "Baby, I am praying every day that I can 
make it home as soon as possible."

BREA-OLINDA HIGH HAS NEW PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John Johnson was hired last month to be Brea Olinda High School's new 
principal, he inherited a state-of-the-art campus and a state-of-the-economy 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Co-principals Gary Goff and Jean Sullivan both resigned over the summer from 
Brea's only high school. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan retired after 25 years with the district and Goff, after 30 years in 
the district, left to start a consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
The new principal must start the new school year which begins today by 
introducing himself to teachers, parents and students, and by coping with 
questions surrounding the effect of $700,000 in cuts the district must make 
from its 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the luxury of the $36-million campus Johnson will oversee, the high 
school's share of the cuts will have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
One of Johnson's first tasks will be to cut one custodial position, one of at 
least 10 that will be made in the district. And students will study in 
ultramodern science labs, but supplies will be handed out carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to be very conservative with supplies," Johnson said. "It's going 
to be tight." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been a junior high vice principal in Corona for five years, 
said he was awed by his first look at Brea-Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
"The reputation of its academics is unbelievable, the campus has a wonderful 
performing arts building, a beautiful stadium -- it's a marvelous facility," 
Johnson said. "It's every principal's dream." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
After a recent investigation of massage parlors in the city resulted in 
prostitution arrests at four of them, police are asking the City Council for an 
ordinance regulating the parlors. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider the ordinance at its Sept. 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
If it is approved, massage parlors in Brea will have six months to be licensed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to keep track of the actual human beings engaged in this 
business, to identify the people giving massages," City Atty. James L. Markman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All massage technicians would have to be licensed by the city, which would run 
background checks on applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes as a result of a three-month police investigation into the 
city's five known massage parlors, said Capt. Jim Oman, head of the 
investigative division. Oman said the probe found that four of the businesses 
were fronts for houses of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious right away that they were being used as houses of 
prostitution," Oman said. "There were mattresses on the floor in one of them. 
They weren't very professional." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are not sure how long the massage parlors have been in business, 
or if others exist. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in unnoticed and have kept a low profile," Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea does not have a city ordinance regulating massage parlors, making it easy 
for anyone to set up such a business. Most cities in the county require massage 
technicians to register annually with the police department or city. 
</P>
<P>
"This was fertile ground for them because there are no actual laws regulating 
massage parlors," Oman said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

CRASH KILLS WOMAN; YOUTH, 17, ARRESTED

A 17-year-old Anaheim youth was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter after his car slammed into another in a Garden Grove intersection, 
injuring the driver and killing her passenger, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact ejected passenger Toni Marie Fatone, 38, of Anaheim, whose body was 
found in bushes about 20 feet from the intersection of Orangewood Avenue and 
Brookhurst Street, Garden Grove police said. She died of massive head injuries 
in the 2 a.m. crash, a spokesman for the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car in which Fatone rode was treated for cuts and bruises at 
Humana Hospital-Westminster and later released, authorities said. She was 
identified as Linda Wendt, 32, of Norwalk, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Bump Willis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related crash that occurred minutes earlier about a quarter of a mile 
away, the Anaheim youth allegedly rammed a motorcyclist with his car and fled, 
police said. The cyclist, Dennis Villalon, 20, of Anaheim was in stable 
condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old suspect apparently was not injured in either collision, Willis 
said. The unidentified teen-ager was being held Sunday at Juvenile Hall in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The chain of events began shortly before 2 a.m., when the suspect got into an 
argument with Villalon at a party in the Garden Grove area, police said. Both 
left the party. The teen-ager then allegedly rammed Villalon's motorcycle at 
Palmwood Drive and Orangewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The youth fled the crash scene and sped westbound on Orangewood, crashing into 
Wendt's car, which was southbound on Brookhurst, police said. The impact spun 
Wendt's car around, ejecting Fatone. 
</P>
<P>
Dazed and with blood streaming down her forehead, Wendt was found sitting 
beside the road wondering what had happened to her passenger, said a nearby 
resident who went outside after she was awakened by the noise. Passersby then 
began searching for Fatone and found her body in the bushes, said the resident, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested at the scene. BILL BILLITER and KRISTINA LINDGREN

DIVERS GO BELOW TO CLEAN UP PLAYGROUND

A golden forest of kelp grows just a few yards off the shore of Woods Cove, a 
favorite spot for Orange County divers. But often, divers find the beauty of 
the colorful water life marred by beer cans and plastic bags chucked between 
the kelp and reef. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 40 water life enthusiasts fanned out to five diving spots in 
Laguna Beach for the second annual Stop Littering Our Beaches and Bays (SLOBB) 
dive. For three hours, divers gave up their scuba gear and instead filled 
garbage bags with litter found along the beaches and in shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
"When you find beer cans sitting along the reef, you wonder how can people be 
so negligent to the innocent creatures," said Yvonne Estrada of Manhattan 
Beach, who drove one hour to Orange County to help in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Despite waves that often reached 5 feet and higher and low visibility below 
surface because of the churned sand, several divers towed mesh bags into the 
water to pick and clean. Using their hands, they scraped the rocks for any 
litter. When they picked up trash, they carefully examined the inside to make 
sure there were no sea animals in it. For those who took to the waters, the 
heavy surf did much of the work for them by carrying some of the litter to the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
Others, who stayed dry, swept the sands with rakes and shovels. Several minutes 
after the cleanup began at 8 a.m., several bags of aluminum soda and beer cans, 
plastic bottles, and wet paper were collected on shore. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is one of the most popular diving spots in Southern California, 
said Randy Buck, manager of the South Laguna-based Adventures in Diving store, 
which sponsored the cleanup. Divers can find bright, tangerine-colored algae, 
green-spotted kelp bass and golden fish just a hundred yards from the beach. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles to San Diego, scuba-divers drive to Orange County beaches to 
take in many of the underwater sights that are just beginning to become 
polluted by negligent beach-goers, Buck said. But too often, the litter ends up 
on the ocean floor amid the rocky reef and the kelp forests, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In many of the spots where seals swim side by side with humans, divers have 
found plastic soda can rings and deflated balloons that could choke sea 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Even the smallest piece of litter can ruin the ocean floor for divers and the 
animals who live in the water, said Estrada, who was just certified in scuba 
diving in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Diving is so peaceful," Estrada said. "But when you find cans and glass 
bottles out in the water, it is disturbing because you know that it goes 
against nature." LILY ENG

HARD WORK BRINGS 'REGINO' TO GOAL;

<P>
HIS CASE ILLUSTRATES THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THIS COUNTRY BY NEWCOMERS INTENT 
ON BETTERING THEIR LIVES.

<P>
Celebrations are in order for a young man whose first goal has been reached, 
that of being financially independent, and he's not yet 40. That is something 
to celebrate for anyone, but it is an even greater accomplishment for someone 
who entered the country undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
But for "Regino," honored by friends at a recent party, reaching one goal is 
only the opportunity to reach for another. It is also a success story to 
encourage others, immigrants and native Americans alike. 
</P>
<P>
Regino and his wife, Maria, have overcome the obstacles of being in a new 
country, learning a new language, and working and saving to own two homes. Now 
that they can live from the rental income, they plan to open a restaurant. In 
their own place, they will use recipes he created while a chef in one of 
Newport Beach's finest establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking began early for Regino. When barely 9 years old and living with his 
mother in Mexico City, he saw that he would have to work. He learned to pop 
corn and sold it on the street, later advancing to tacos. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the passers-by spoke a strange language, and he heard they came from a 
land up north. As he grew older he learned more of this place, where one would 
work to exhaustion, but where one's labor could carry a person beyond mere 
existence. Someday, he decided, he would find a way to go there. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Regino's working became full time. Although he enjoyed school, he 
had to drop out after the sixth grade. He found a job selling furniture and 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of years of work, a bright spot, he met Maria. Their minds and 
dreams merged in marriage. He says of her, "She is my companion, my partner in 
business and marriage." But as hard as they worked in Mexico, they saw it was 
not reaping a future, only survival. The land to the north had to be better. 
</P>
<P>
To come with legal documents to the U.S. from Mexico, one must already have a 
connection. A legal resident can petition for spouse and child. A citizen can 
petition for spouse, child, parents, or siblings. Even then there is a wait 
from one to 10 years. There are quotas for some groups and waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
What of those who do not have a relative already here? It is like asking the 
pilgrims to have had a family member among the Indians to petition them to come 
to America. 
</P>
<P>
When their daughter was only a year old, and his wife was expecting their 
second, they made the decision. Like fathers everywhere, he wanted to be where 
his work would support his family. 
</P>
<P>
So one dark night Regino, crawling on his stomach with his baby cradled in his 
arms, moved slowly, inch by inch across the beach near San Diego. His wife, 
Maria, heavy with child, crawled beside him, fearfully, breathing as softly as 
possible. Like the determined people around them, they thought only of not 
being detected. Maria, as the Maria for whom she was named, wanted to have a 
good place for her baby to be born. If they were caught and sent back, they 
would start over again. For some around them, it was the only hope their 
families at home had to survive. All of them were determined to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Once here, Regino and Maria lost no time in starting to work. Although jobs are 
not always easy to find without proper documents, they were fortunate enough to 
find work in the same restaurant. Maria was in charge of parties, arranging the 
tables for groups of up to 200. Regino, as chef, would prepare and create. 
Often his new ideas were featured on the menu as the "Recipe of the Week." As 
his teacher, I was treated to a specialty seafood dish with an exotic sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the baby he carried over and the new little girl, born a U.S. 
citizen, grew in this environment of love and work and started school here. The 
oldest daughter, now a 10th-grader, has done more than excel in school. She is 
already in a special UC Irvine program for advanced students, with plans for 
college. During all this time, Regino worked as two men. Leaving one job, he 
hurried to another, often sleeping only three or four hours a day. Maria was 
working eight hours a day, plus her work managing the home. Their oldest tested 
her wings with a summer job. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of his years of work, legal changes made life somewhat easier. 
Congress passed the amnesty law, giving those who had been here since 1981 the 
chance to file for legal residence. This makes working so much easier. One can 
live without the daily pressure of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Once Regino and Maria began the process, they had to study English and U.S. 
history and government. This they were glad to do, although it meant 
rearranging work to attend classes. They learned of the struggles of the people 
before them, the Indians, the Pilgrims, immigrants of the 1880s, the women's 
struggle for suffrage, the Bill of Rights, and how a bill becomes law. Maria, 
especially, who has attended high school, was full of questions in class, 
always making top marks on exams. They learned how California went from Spain 
to Mexico to the United States, and of their responsibilities when they became 
citizens. (Their daughter was learning the same in public school.) 
</P>
<P>
Five years from the day they became permanent residents last year, Maria and 
Regino will take the test to become U.S. citizens. Then there will be a new 
reason for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
They are but one example of the contribution to this country that many new 
immigrants are making. Like others from his country, and throughout the world, 
he brings with him the same work ethic and desire to make things better for his 
family and new home as our nation's original settlers.

Firefighters quickly extinguished a small blaze in a laundry room of the 
Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel about 3 a.m. Sunday after some guests were 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was snuffed out in 20 minutes and damage was limited to about $1,500, 
firefighters said. The cause of the fire was attributed to "spontaneous 
combustion of soiled, greasy kitchen rags in a laundry room in the lower lobby 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said there was a partial evacuation of the hotel at 777 
Convention Way, but they had no estimate of how many guests were involved. No 
one was injured, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six firefighters and six engines responded to the blaze, according to 
Fire Department officials.

Police are looking for a man who raped a 15-year-old jogger Saturday afternoon 
off the bike trail behind her apartment complex in a east Yorba Linda 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose name was not released because of her age and the nature of the 
crime, was jogging on the trail about 4:20 p.m. when a man emerged from the 
bushes, grabbed her and dragged her back to the underbrush, Brea Police Sgt. 
Doug Dickerson said. She screamed but her apartment complex was several hundred 
yards away, Dickerson said, and apparently no one heard her. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who attends an area high school, walked back to her residence near La 
Palma Avenue and Camino de Bryant after the attack and was taken to St. Jude 
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton where she was treated and 
released, Dickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the relatively new housing development next to the apartment 
complex were shaken and surprised to hear of the attack Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We all feel safe here because it's all nice, new homes," said Arlene Dragon, a 
2 1/2-year resident of the neighborhood. "There aren't any stores around, and 
there just aren't people hanging around out here." 
</P>
<P>
Dragon said that the bike trail is elevated and paved but that there are trees 
and bushes about 15 feet down the banks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first I've ever heard of this happening," another resident said. 
"This is a real safe area. It's Yorba Linda -- things like this don't happen 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gardiner, a 3 1/2-year resident of the area, said, "I know that there are 
transients who stay in Featherly Park and I know of some incidents, but never a 
rape or an attack like that." Featherly Regional Park is an overnight camping 
ground that fronts the housing tract on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it does have a profound effect on us," Gardiner said. "And there are 
people out there all the time. Gosh, that's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said that there had been some attacks in the area and in the park in 
the past but that they were not similar and that he did not believe them to be 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for a man who looks Latino, about 5-foot-10, 140 pounds, 
with short, black hair. He was wearing a white T-shirt, white shorts, white 
tennis shoes and a maroon baseball cap when the attack occurred, Dickerson 
said.

ANN CONWAY: WAYNE GLAD O.C. PUT UP HER DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Where is it?" Pilar Wayne wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Where was the new, colorized version of the John Wayne statue? "I thought it 
was going to be right in the middle of the terminal," John Wayne's widow said 
Friday night at the gala christening of the new Thomas F. Riley Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"Help! We're lost." The exotic-looking Wayne, her daughter Aissa in tow, had 
popped into the black-tie party to get a look at the refurbished statue of the 
man she calls "the Duke." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I've seen the statue of the Duke before -- when it was outside," she 
reminded, looking elegantly out of place as she swept by a baggage claim area, 
wearing emeralds and black chiffon with coq feathers. "I come here often to fly 
to Denver to see our daughter Marisa." 
</P>
<P>
The former actress held her head high as her dark brown eyes scanned the 
buff-toned terminal. Onward she and Aissa trekked, past ticket counters, past 
rent-a-car booths, past more baggage-claim areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, look!" she said, nudging Aissa. "There he is! A beautiful setting." 
</P>
<P>
And then the beautiful brown eyes glazed over. Suddenly, she was in another 
place, another time. She was choked up. "This is emotional," said Pilar, her 
right hand sparkling with the postage-stamp size emerald the Duke gave her on 
their 10th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like he's right here with us," Aissa said, gazing up at the 
bigger-than-life likeness of her dad. 
</P>
<P>
With a little coaxing, the two women ascended the tiny staircase that helps 
visitors to John Wayne Airport reach out and touch the movie hero. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to come back soon and spend more time," Pilar said. 
</P>
<P>
And then they were off, into the night. "Aissa has a tennis game tomorrow," 
Pilar explained. 
</P>
<P>
Where? At the John Wayne Tennis Club, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Up, up and away: Talk about a magic carpet ride. It was only black Astroturf, 
but that didn't keep guests from acting like they were soaring on Persian rugs 
Saturday at the gala-in-a-tent that celebrated the new, $22-million Patty and 
George Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Spirits were so high for the "Arabian Nights" fantasy, in fact, that guests 
such as the cancer center's medical director, Dr. Robert Dillman, helped put 
finishing touches on the Casbah-like scene: sky-scraping palms and colorful 
tables topped with glitzed camel sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I didn't do that much," said Dillman, enjoying the festivities with his 
wife, Jackie. "I just put some of the number cards on the tables." 
</P>
<P>
But the reason Dillman wanted to help, he said, was that his wife was a member 
of the Sandpipers, a support group of Hoag Hospital since 1974. The Sandpipers, 
founded by the late Corky Elkouri, staged the $300-per-couple benefit, which 
netted proceeds estimated at $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The party's superstars were the beloved Patty and George Hoag, donors of $6 
million to the three-story facility. "Patty and George have set the sail, the 
contributors have given it wind, and now, the staff will bring the vision to 
reality," said Sharon MacDonald, the center's administrative director. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoags appeared briefly before the 700-strong crowd, who gave the popular 
couple a standing ovation as they approached the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proud that this beautiful structure bears our name," said George Hoag, 
the hospital's chairman emeritus. Patty Hoag, resplendent in aquamarines and a 
shimmering, sea-blue gown, didn't speak. She simply smiled a heart-stopping 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag Hospital President Michael Stephens, attending with his wife, Diane, said 
the new 65,000-square-foot facility will lessen stress for cancer patients 
seeking outpatient treatment. "The center has enabled us to take all of our 
cancer services and put them in a single building," he said. "A patient can see 
his physician on the third floor and go to other floors within the center for 
treatment and educational services." Plus, the center was created with a 
"patient-friendly environment in mind," Stephens said. "It is 
non-institutional. Here, patients will enjoy a soft, pleasant atmosphere. And 
so will their families."

<P>
After a cocktail reception, guests filed into the tent for a sit-down dinner 
that included delicious tabouli salad, beef and chicken filets, and 
white-chocolate mousse cheesecake with raspberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
"Cancer is something we live with," said Dillman, taking a breather after the 
first course (the tent became so warm during dinner that the gala committee 
thoughtfully had some of its "walls" removed). "It's not something we should 
hide in a dark corner. One out of three of us will get it. It's a part of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The good news, Dillman said, is that 65% of the people with cancer will be 
alive five years after the disease has been diagnosed. "Only 25% survived up to 
five years in 1950," he said. "The bad news is that, with the longevity we're 
having, and the carcinogens in the air, more people are getting cancer than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Being treated at a cancer center forces people to be open about the disease. 
And that's good, Dillman said. "There's nothing shameful about having cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: Walter Gerken -- honorary gala chairman -- with his wife, 
Darlene, and gala chairwoman Marilyn Reed, attending with her husband, Jay. 
</P>
<P>
Serving on the gala committee were Joy Curry, Suzy Riley, Pat Warmington, 
Laraine Eggleston, Patti Estabrooks (Corki Elkouri's daughter, stunning in a 
hooded, Arabesque ensemble paired with a sapphire-and-diamond necklace), Karen 
Whitaker, Janet Sawyer, Carolyn Pike and Debbie Hogan. Other guests included 
Mary and James Roosevelt; Shirlee and Bob Guggenheim; Grant Hoag (son of the 
Hoags) with his daughter, Victoria; Suzanne Pierce (beautiful in a cloud of hot 
pink silk); Clara Jane Nixon; Tom and Marilyn Nielsen; Sandy and Richard 
Sewell; Alan and Nila Trider; Nora and Charles Hester; Robert and Bobbi Grant; 
Maria Crutcher; Roger and Candice Schnapp, and Nora Jorgensen.

OSLIN BRINGS BROADWAY TO COUNTRY 
</P>

<P>
K.T. Oslin brought so much gusto, sureness and skill to her musical role 
playing Friday night that you would have thought she was on a Broadway stage 
rather than putting on a country music concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Oslin was on Broadway years ago, long before she emerged in 1987, at 
age 45, as one of the most unlikely and most distinctive new stars in 
Nashville. The Broadway training still serves the Texas native well -- both in 
her ability to write songs that play out well as dramatic or comic scenes, and 
in her knack for bringing those scenes to life on stage. 
</P>
<P>
In a way that is beyond the grasp of big pop names like Cher or Madonna, who 
are caught up in projecting themselves as stars, Oslin did a real actor's work 
-- conjuring characters and investing them with flesh and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
What she described at one point during the 70-minute show as "my very strange 
brand of country music" probably owes more to the urban adult-pop sensibility 
of a Carole King than it does to honky-tonk tradition. But what plants Oslin 
firmly in the country corral (besides a twangy, husky voice quality that at 
times echoed the quieter, "Me and Bobby McGee" side of Janis Joplin) is her 
affinity for telling stories about Everywoman and Everyman. 
</P>
<P>
Country's demand for earthy, recognizable situations that reflect common 
experience keeps Oslin's role playing on track: she's not going to play the 
unreachable star, like most theatrically inclined pop divas; she's going to 
play parts that intersect with life as her listeners know it. 
</P>
<P>
With an expressive look or a canny bit of phrasing, Oslin was able to portray a 
wide range of feelings and character types. 
</P>
<P>
She was particularly adept, on songs like "Hey Bobby" and "Younger Men," at 
playing a brassy, openly lustful woman plotting a friendly takeover of some 
handsome sex object. But on "Hold Me," Oslin ranged far from that sexual 
swagger as she portrayed a husband and wife frightened by their loss of passion 
for each other ("Don't kiss me like we're married, kiss me like we're lovers"). 
</P>
<P>
One of the set's highlights was "Willie and Mary," one of four strong numbers 
Oslin sang from her upcoming third album, "Love in a Small Town." Willie and 
Mary fail to find lovers because they want star-quality partners and won't 
settle for an ordinary man or woman. Because she kept her sights set on 
ordinary things, Oslin's star-quality performing personality shone all the 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Van Shelton, who shared headliner billing with Oslin, showed slightly 
more personality than a cigar store Indian during his hour on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton is a brilliant vocalist -- he may have the most assured, resonant male 
voice in country music -- but a nearly useless singer. Singers, especially good 
country singers, dip notes in the grit and sweat of life, pulling them out 
drenched with feeling. Shelton was versatile, impeccable, and utterly frigid -- 
Felix Unger in a white cowboy hat, delivering music that was clean, clean, 
glisteningly clean, whether based on honky-tonk music or rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton barely spoke, barely moved, barely let an expression cross his stolid 
face. He did lean back a little for the big dramatic ending of the set's best 
number, "Statue of a Fool," and, in a daring move for him, he waggled his left 
ankle vigorously during one of the rockers. After laying out his set in a 
monotonous, unaltering uptempo-ballad-uptempo-ballad sequence, Shelton strung 
together a sequence of rock covers near the end. Great voice that he is, 
Shelton delivered near-perfect re-creations of the original vocals from "Great 
Balls of Fire" and "Oh Pretty Woman." But the first was devoid of Jerry Lee 
Lewis' randiness, and the second had none of Roy Orbison's nervous desire. Like 
most of the set, the two oldies were just a matter of technical display. 
</P>
<P>
Baillie and the Boys, a husband-and-wife team, plus backing musicians, opened 
with 30 minutes of pleasant country-tinged soft rock. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Kathie Baillie showed an appealing, reedy voice well-suited for the 
plaintive emotional tenor that dominated the duo's songs. But can Baillie also 
muster a sassier, tougher dimension? If she hangs out on bills with K.T. Oslin 
long enough, maybe that will rub off.

The music business has a lot to offer mystery-lovers, what with little industry 
perplexities such as, "How can bands have million-selling records and nothing 
to show for it?" and "How come it currently costs less to make a CD than an LP 
but the CD still retails for $5 more?" 
</P>
<P>
One mystery particular to Orange County is, "How come the Garden Grove-raised 
James Intveld isn't a star and doesn't even have a recording contract?" 
</P>
<P>
In an industry rife with clone-band tax writeoffs, one would think there's at 
least a little room for a performer as excellent, complete and distinctive as 
Intveld proved to be in his set opening for Jamie James at the new Peppers 
Golden Bear on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While Intveld is following an entirely different course than Stockton-bred 
Chris Isaak, there are some comparisons that can be made between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Intveld isn't yet as unique a stylist as Isaak, but both have a knack for 
taking early-roots rock influences and giving them their own timeless stamp. 
And like Isaak, Intveld, with his underfed James Dean looks, certainly has that 
video-ready quality the industry loves. The 30-year-old singer's only problem 
may be that he's been toiling for so long in the trendy Los Angeles scene that 
the industry now takes him for granted. 
</P>
<P>
But Intveld certainly hasn't let a sense of inertia creep into his work. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a propulsive trio of bassist Greg Boaz, keyboardist Rick Solem and 
former X drummer D.J. Bonebrake, he delivered a shaking 11-song set Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Intveld's strongest suit is his songs. He has a fine knack for melding a raw 
rock sound -- there are touches of everything from Gene Vincent to the 
Yardbirds -- with a persuasive, hook-laden pop sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
On his "Thinking About You," that combination resulted in an ebullient pop song 
that sounded somewhat like a grittier Traveling Wilburys. "Tracy," co-written 
with keyboardist Solem, mixed that pop surety with a strain of melancholy, 
while the Bo Diddley-beat "That's Me" was every bit as cocky and wild as its 
self-assertive chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Though Intveld once needed a lead guitarist to properly flesh out his songs, 
these days he's got both rhythm and lead duties amply covered with his red Les 
Paul guitar. 
</P>
<P>
His vocals had both an appealing reedy quality and enough power -- especially 
on the ballad "Such a Lonely Night" -- to convey his emotion above an overloud 
band mix that often obscured the actual lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to say that his performance stunned the crowd, but a goodly 
number of people in the Bear only seemed to be there waiting for the post-show 
disco music to start up. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new club appears to have the technical amenities down, its 
double-duty concert/disco setup may make it a difficult place in which to 
seriously appreciate music.

HISTORICAL HILARITY IN 'CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA'; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE KICKS OFF ITS 71ST SEASON WITH GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S 
COMEDY.

<P>
Though George Bernard Shaw did not intend "Caesar and Cleopatra" to be played 
as a historical comedy bordering on a Hollywood sendup, he certainly knew how 
to write a running gag worthy of the Borscht Belt. 
</P>
<P>
The gag has to do with Caesar's inability to pronounce the name of Cleopatra's 
royal nurse, Ftatateeta, a tongue twister not unsuited to her nature. Shaw has 
Caesar calling her everything from Totateeta to Tfatafeeta and -- in an insult 
reflecting both his lingual exasperation and the wish to deflate her sinister 
self-importance -- just plain Tota. 
</P>
<P>
At the Moulton Theatre, where "Caesar and Cleopatra" opened the Laguna 
Playhouse's 71st season over the weekend, Douglas Rowe, as Caesar, certainly 
knows how to milk that gag. In the finest Jack Benny tradition, Rowe commands 
the royal nurse to do his bidding with silly names like Tototitty, Tittytata 
and -- in the most cutting deadpan of all -- Toto, an apt irony refering to 
Dorothy's innocent little dog in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw might have cringed at the liberties taken with his text, but that is not 
the point. The point is that this lavishly mounted, warmly lit, handsomely 
costumed Laguna production treats the play from beginning to end with a certain 
lightness of touch that can be suggestively illuminating. The 
sometimes-very-funny results have a salubrious effect perhaps not as distant 
from Shaw's original intent as might be presumed. 
</P>
<P>
After all, "Caesar and Cleopatra" was meant to bring the title characters back 
to earth from the pretentious heights of what Shaw called Sardoodledom and 
Bardolatry, to which they'd been elevated by a 19th-Century theatrical 
tradition that he abhored. Both Caesar and Cleopatra land on the Moulton stage 
without benefit of parachutes, but also without archaic conceits that might 
have crippled the revival of a 91-year-old play. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century tradition Shaw sought to demolish -- now long since forgotten, 
in great part because of his success -- had thrived on pomp and ceremony fueled 
by the artificial melodramas of fashionable playwrights such as Victorien 
Sardou -- who drew overblown stage portraits of historical figures from 
Napoleon to Cleopatra -- and by an abundance of worshipful Shakespearean 
pageants, including such favorites as "Julius Caesar" and "Antony and 
Cleopatra." 
</P>
<P>
As an antidote, Shaw chose to write history as comedy. He exalted a 
middle-aged, common-sense Caesar whose greatness resides in pragmatic 
experience modified, but not stymied, by moral compunctions. He is a man of 
honor, nonetheless, who confounds even his closest aides with ideas of 
clemency. The greatest of Shaw's early dramatic portraits, this Caesar is an 
incipient "superman" representing intellectual achievement translated into 
effective action. 
</P>
<P>
As for Cleopatra, she is depicted as a gullible teen-ager whose bid for the 
Egyptian throne is transformed from petulant wish to subtler calculation under 
Caesar's tutelage. Not that Caesar ever manages to instill in her any of his 
moral principles. Nor does he ever come to trust her. In Shaw's scheme of 
things, even an incomplete version of the "new woman" must be given wide berth 
by a man who epitomizes the height of human achievement. 
</P>
<P>
But Caesar does find Cleopatra useful. And amusing. Though she frequently 
wounds his masculine vanity with another of the play's running jokes -- this 
one about Caesar's middle-aged decrepitude -- he winks toward future history 
like an indulgent father and promises to send Mark Antony to Egypt to satisfy 
her youthful craving for a Roman general with muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The play eschews the slightest hint of a romantic relationship between Caesar 
and Cleopatra, a point that Shaw insisted upon. Yet if any single moment can be 
said to encapsulate the comic concept of this production, it is the instant 
when they bid each other farewell with a passionate kiss that leaves Caesar 
weak-kneed and wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who has chosen to play Caesar with so little inflection as to seem 
colorless most of the time, here tosses off the priceless gesture of a man 
conked over the head. You can almost see the stars. In fact, it makes you wish 
the rest of Rowe's down-to-earth performance had an injection of the very sort 
of heightened theatricality that he apparently has gone out of his way to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Helm plays Cleopatra with a lusty simplicity. As for the rest of the 
large cast, they acquit themselves nicely. The best supporting performance is 
turned in by David William Carr, who gives a very natural account of 
Apollodorus. Others worth noting are Jerry Newman's Pothinus, Josephine Black's 
Ftatateeta, John Huntington's Britannus, Bryan Burnes' Rufio and Anthony 
Ramirez's Lucius Achillas. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the physical production meets the playhouse's usually high standard. 
Robert L. Smith has devised a lavish Egyptian setting that simulates rough-hewn 
marble and bathes it in lambent lighting. Karen J. Weller's costumes are an 
equivalent eyeful. And David Edwards' sound design is better than usual.

POLARIZATION BRINGS CONSERVATION TO LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: PLASTIC PANELS INVENTED THREE DECADES AGO CAN CUT A BUILDING'S LIGHT 
BILLS IN HALF AND TRIM 25% OFF AIR-CONDITIONING BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Myron Kahn can hardly control his excitement these days, what with President 
Bush actually saying the words "energy conservation" on national television in 
response to the Mideast oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Every time Americans get nervous about all the energy they waste, Kahn, of 
Tarzana, receives a flurry of orders for the polarizing panels he invented 
three decades ago -- thin lenses of plastic that can cut an office building's 
light bills by up to half and trim another 25% off the air-conditioning bills. 
</P>
<P>
Interest is also mounting, albeit slowly, in various pockets of the country. 
Several utilities in California and other states have begun offering rebates to 
businesses that install the energy-saving panels. And in Sacramento, new 
statewide building guidelines for lighting will allow builders to opt for 
polarizing panels and other innovative techniques over traditional lighting 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
The way polarization works is simple enough: The clear panels contain laminated 
layers that convert randomly vibrating light rays into a vertical pattern. 
Installed below ceiling lights, the panels transform the bothersome horizontal 
light rays that ricochet off desktops and computer screens and cause what we 
know as glare. With glare reduced, the eye sees richer colors and details. And 
when the useless horizontal rays become vertically polarized, they are better 
absorbed by objects and reflected back to the eye, further aiding vision. 
</P>
<P>
That is why art museums often use natural lighting, and why artists love to 
paint under blue skies. Sunlight is automatically polarized during its passage 
through the Earth's atmosphere, creating a superior setting, here on the 
planet's surface, for the eye to judge color, texture and detail. Conversely, 
on an overcast day the polarizing effects are disrupted. The result is glare. 
That is why people often squint under a slate-gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
What on earth does this have to do with cutting light bills by as much as half 
in the American workplace? 
</P>
<P>
Glare creates most of the visual problems in the office or factory. According 
to several lighting experts, once the light is polarized, employees can see 
their computers, desktop papers, factory equipment or other work surfaces so 
much better that about one-quarter to one-half of the overhead light bulbs can 
simply be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an elegant and simple technology for minimizing glare," said lighting 
researcher Robert Sardinsky of the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute. 
"The real value is that if you reduce glare, you can reduce the quantity of 
light. A bright room is not the answer to good vision." 
</P>
<P>
Not only are lighting bills slashed, according to independent studies, but the 
considerable heat generated by overhead light bulbs is reduced. That means air 
conditioners can be turned down, further cutting electrical costs. Employees 
working beneath polarizing panels also routinely report fewer headaches and 
reduced tension once glare is controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Today, from IBM's complex in Lisbon, Portugal, to the Department of Water and 
Power headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, buildings that were once 
electricity hogs have gone on the energy diet prescribed by Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 million square feet of the desktop-size polarizing panels, selling 
for about $15 each, have been installed in 4,000 buildings worldwide since 
Kahn, 73, invented and patented them in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to why Kahn, deeply troubled by events unfolding in Iraq and 
what they portend for the country's energy supply, is so keenly monitoring the 
White Houses's sudden interest in conservation. 
</P>
<P>
For all its energy-saving properties, polarized light has never been widely 
accepted in America, where the major lighting conglomerates and large utility 
companies have generally pushed for the sale of more energy, more light bulbs 
and more lighting devices -- not less. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting industry spokesmen contend that they are waiting for more scientific 
proof that polarization significantly improves vision as it reduces glare. But 
the same groups have eagerly popularized other glare-control devices, from 
metal louvers to prismatic panels, without waiting for scientific documentation 
of significantly improved vision, Kahn says. 
</P>
<P>
"The industries who benefit from selling unnecessary lamps, lighting fixtures 
and power have a stranglehold on America's future," he says. "All the 
skyscrapers going up today are using parabolic fixtures and other 
energy-wasting devices that create glare. It's going to cost a fortune in light 
bills over the lifetime of a building. But worse than that, we're using up 
energy as if it were water." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to conserving electricity, the economic stakes are indeed high. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental and conservation 
research group, has estimated that California's commercial ratepayers would 
save $2 billion a year if all existing and new buildings were outfitted with 
basic energy-efficient lighting systems now readily available. The calculations 
did not include polarized lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $2-billion saving is equivalent to the electricity generated in a 
year by 4 1/2 oil-fueled power plants. The reduced demand would also mean that 
$7.5 billion worth of construction in new power plants could be avoided, 
according to the research group. 
</P>
<P>
Because polarizing panels can achieve energy savings of 25% to 50%, they could 
play a meaningful role in cutting electricity demands in the United States. But 
Kahn faces an uphill battle, in part because most lighting designers have never 
even heard of polarizing panels. 
</P>
<P>
Polarized lighting is so little known within the lighting industry that 
Southern California Edison Co.'s new demonstration laboratory -- which purports 
to be a showcase for the latest in energy-efficient lighting techniques -- has 
no display on the benefits of polarization. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is often on the cutting 
edge of new conservation techniques, include polarization in its high-tech 
lighting lab, opened in Seattle last year. One of the agency's researchers, who 
asked not to be named, said, "I don't know how this type of polarizing works, 
or what it is supposed to do for energy conservation." 
</P>
<P>
Even graduates of top engineering schools still mistakenly try to correct glare 
in the workplace by throwing more artificial light into a room, according to 
lighting engineer Bill Jones, director of Lighting Research Laboratory in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you should do is the first thing most people try -- attacking 
bad vision with even more lighting," Jones said. "There's just a tremendous 
lack of education out there among people who really should know better." 
</P>
<P>
Lighting experts say much of the ignorance stems from the fact that the 
Illuminating Engineering Society, an influential trade organization, has 
resisted pressure from Kahn and others to include recommendations for polarized 
lighting systems in its specifications manual. 
</P>
<P>
The society's manual is a bible for American contractors, architects, engineers 
and interior designers when they create lighting systems for buildings. 
</P>
<P>
H. Richard Blackwell, a world authority on lighting who has written hundreds of 
papers on the subject, said his studies in the 1970s, for which he won a 
prestigious Gold Medal award, showed that polarizing panels improved vision and 
required far less light than the room brightness levels recommended by the 
Illuminating Engineering Society. 
</P>
<P>
"Illumination standards for buildings still do not include the information we 
had more than 15 years ago, and this strikes me as the most ridiculous thing in 
the world," said Blackwell, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University. "I 
fought hard for fair play for polarization . . . but the vested interests did 
not want to hear that less lamps and less lights were needed. 
</P>
<P>
"My former students are now running the IES, and they seem to have developed 
bad habits. My feeling is that because national productivity and global energy 
are involved, it's no time for them to be acting cute." 
</P>
<P>
Don Thomas, IES president and an executive of GTE-Sylvania, said the issue is 
more complex than the society's critics make it. While agreeing that polarizing 
panels are an effective shield against glare and allow reduced lighting, Thomas 
said the IES is not in a position to decide if polarization provides better 
vision than competing glare-control techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We need Myron's help, not his opposition," Thomas said. "We need money and 
support to research these things." 
</P>
<P>
He denied a frequent charge by critics that the IES has fallen into the same 
profit-motivated syndrome that afflicted Detroit car manufacturers, who failed 
for years to make American automobiles gas-efficient and were finally forced to 
do so by the government during the 1970s oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an unfair charge," Thomas said. "It's not good marketing to hoodwink 
the public into buying more when it's not needed." 
</P>
<P>
(The IES bases its recommendations on the light measurement known as 
foot-candles, a formula arrived upon in the 1930s that is not correlated to 
vision, but simply assesses the brightness thrown off by a given light source. 
The society's recommended light levels for a given task, from sewing to typing, 
were increased steadily from the 1950s until the 1970s oil crisis.) 
</P>
<P>
Many conservation experts fear that once the current oil crisis subsides, 
energy-efficient technologies that have been struggling for national 
recognition, such as polarizing panels, will lose their momentum. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other forces are at play, however, that may help elevate polarized 
lighting to the consumer's shopping list of environmentally conscious products. 
</P>
<P>
Utility companies in Massachusetts and California have begun offering rebates 
to businesses that install polarizing panels to cut electricity use. The 
data-processing industry, hoping to reduce computer-screen glare that causes 
headaches and impedes worker productivity, is looking for ways to adapt the 
principles of polarized lighting to computer equipment. And Suffolk County in 
New York has approved laws to protect employees at video-display terminals by 
using overhead polarized panels to improve vision and reduce glare. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, California's Energy Commission, a national trend-setter, last month 
published new statewide lighting guidelines, which recommend that designers 
install lighting based upon how well the eye actually sees, instead of relying 
solely on the Illuminating Engineering Society's standards for room brightness. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at promoting energy conservation, the new guidelines recommend as an 
option to the longtime IES standards a visual performance measurement developed 
by Blackwell known as equivalent spherical illumination. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say the new guidelines pry the door open for intelligent lighting 
technology a little bit," said lighting engineer Jones, a member of the 
advisory committee that wrote the guidelines, and a fellow of the Illuminating 
Engineering Society, "but not nearly enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POLARIZING LIGHT 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polarized light panels can reduce energy costs and improve effective vision by 
reducing surface reflections and glare. Here's a look at light waves and how 
they are polarized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Normal Light 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Normal light beams consist of rays vibrating in random directions. The waves 
vibrating vertically produce better contrast and color, enhancing vision. 
Horizontal waves produce glare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polarized light 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polarized light consists of waves vibrating in primarily one plane. Normal 
light can be polarized using a special multi-layer filter which permits 
vertically vibrating planes of light to pass through. Most important, the 
multi-layer filter causes light traveling the horizontal plane to bounce back 
and forth until it is converted to vertical-plane light, which then passes 
through the filter. This system is different from linear polarized sunglasses, 
which block out light vibrating in the horizontal plane.

MONROVIA, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Samuel Doe was killed by rebels and his bullet-scarred body has been 
put on display at their camp outside Monrovia, news and government reports said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers returning to Monrovia told the British Broadcasting Corp. that Doe 
died in a rebel camp where he was taken Sunday after he was wounded and 
captured by rebel forces in a fierce gun battle in the capital of his war-torn 
West African nation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. 
officials regard the reports as reliable and consider them confirmation of 
Doe's death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberia's main rebel fighters demanded today that West African 
troops withdraw from Monrovia and said they will keep fighting despite Doe's 
death at the hands of Prince Yormie Johnson's rival rebel faction. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Woewiyu, chief spokesman of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front, 
dashed hopes for an early end to the tribal conflict in which three warring 
parties have killed more than 5,000 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Doe was interrogated by Prince Johnson over large amounts of money he allegedly 
embezzled during his time in power, then killed, the BBC quoted the travelers 
as saying. The president's body, badly mutilated, was reportedly on display at 
the camp. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said the department has reports from 
several sources, including representatives of forces led by Prince Johnson, 
that Doe "died from the gunshot wounds he suffered in the shoot-out with Prince 
Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Dillen said he had no further information. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had telephoned the BBC to say he had captured Doe in a battle Sunday as 
Liberia's leader of 10 years was trying to flee the country, possibly on a ship 
of a West African task force sent to end the 8 1/2-month-old war. 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu's announcement that Taylor's rebels will keep fighting came in a 
telephone interview from Burkina Faso, one of eight West African nations he has 
visited in an effort to get the West African force to withdraw from Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"Their mission has failed, and a prime example is the capture of Doe by the 
Prince Johnson group right in their headquarters," Woewiyu said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnson, whose men felled Doe in a battle at the headquarters of the 
West African task force in Monrovia port, declared that he will run Liberia 
until elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson controls Monrovia, but Taylor's 10,000-strong army has overrun much of 
the rest of Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Gambian President Dawda Jawara said today that Doe's ouster may help the peace 
process in Liberia. "All the factions that were involved in the fighting, 
including other interest groups, were insisting that Doe must go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the West African community will try to consult both rebel leaders about 
an interim government. He made no reference to Johnson's having declared 
himself president.

Cambodia's warring factions agreed today to share power in a transitional 
ruling council and endorsed a U.N. peace plan aimed at ending the country's 
11-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Although resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk unexpectedly announced that 
he is taking a six-month leave of absence for reasons of health, his 
three-party guerrilla resistance coalition and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 
unanimously supported the formation of a 12-seat Supreme National Council. 
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of two days of negotiations in the 
Indonesian capital identified six members of Hun Sen's government as members of 
the council. The remaining six seats will come from the guerrilla resistance 
coalition, with each faction allowed two members. 
</P>
<P>
The parties also agreed that a peace plan recently adopted by the five 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would serve "in its entirety as 
the basis for settling the Cambodian conflict." 
</P>
<P>
The warring factions met today to discuss who will rule their country until 
elections can be held. A day earlier, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
had said the four factions had indicated that they could accept the U.N. peace 
plan as a negotiating framework. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up by the permanent members of the Security Council -- the 
United States, the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain. Negotiations are 
now aimed at forming an interim administration, Alatas said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks have been a series of meetings among the factions and mediators 
Alatas and Edwige Avice, the French deputy foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government was represented by Hun Sen. For the 
three rebel factions, Khieu Samphan represented the Communist Khmer Rouge, 
former Prime Minister Son Sann the anti-Communist Khmer People's National 
Liberation Front and Prince Norodom Ranariddh the followers of his father.

Teams of divers resumed their search this morning for a Bell Gardens man 
presumed drowned in Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old man, whose name was not released, jumped from a rented rowboat 
into the water about 5 p.m. Sunday, said Fred Elam, senior lake lifeguard at 
Castaic Lake, about 10 miles north of Santa Clarita. 
</P>

The man apparently had consumed several beers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said the man had been seen jumping in the water earlier 
Sunday afternoon and was warned of the danger.

Divers from the county-operated lake and from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department discontinued their search at 6:45 p.m. Sunday, Elam said. 
</P>
<P>
The search resumed at 7 a.m. today with a flight over the lake by a Los Angeles 
County Fire Department helicopter, Elam said. Sixteen divers, working in teams

Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced today that he will visit Syria 
to coordinate the U.S. drive against Iraq with President Hafez Assad, despite 
differences with the Syrian government over human rights and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said President Bush directed him to go to Damascus on Thursday night 
after he winds up talks in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"The President felt it was an important time to have a face-to-face dialogue," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, in a makeshift alliance with the United States, has sent troops to Saudi 
Arabia and to the United Arab Emirates to guard their oil fields against an 
Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to have some differences with Syria and we expect to discuss those 
differences," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also reported that together Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and 
the overthrown government of Kuwait will contribute $12 billion to help pay for 
the U.S. defense of the Persian Gulf and assist nations hurt financially by 
their adherence to a boycott of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
While touring the Persian Gulf last week, Baker received commitments of aid -- 
without specific amounts -- from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Zayid 
of the United Arab Emirates. Emir Jabir al Sabah of the displaced Kuwaiti 
government offered $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said roughly half of the $12-billion total will go to offset American 
efforts in the Gulf, which include the presence of U.S. troops. The other half 
will assist poorer nations observing the boycott of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Baker asked NATO allies to send ground troops into the Persian 
Gulf region to boost the military buildup and heighten pressure on Iraq to 
withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"He made this request for additional ground forces" at a meeting of NATO 
foreign ministers to discuss the weekend U.S.-Soviet summit, NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no decision reached on that but obviously that was not the 
intention," he said after the two-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A British official, who asked not to be identified, said his government will 
"give active consideration" to the latest U.S. request.

POPE CONSECRATES OPULENT AFRICAN BASILICA

<P>
Pope John Paul II today consecrated Africa's largest and most costly basilica 
as a Nigerian cardinal dismissed criticisms that the church smacked of 
extravagance on an impoverished continent. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope blessed the $200-million Our Lady of Peace Basilica on the last day of 
his 10-day tour of Africa, during which he called on the world not to forget 
Africa's development needs. 
</P>
<P>
The basilica, taller than St. Peter's in Rome, towers over the coconut 
plantations and tin shacks of the country's political capital, Yamoussoukro. It 
was donated to the Vatican by Ivorian leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny, 85, 
Africa's longest-serving president. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope made no mention of the controversy. He thanked Houphouet-Boigny, who 
was in the basilica. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates say the president spent about $150 million of his own 
money to build it. 
</P>
<P>
The basilica is extravagant by African standards. It has marble floors, 
hand-blown stained-glass windows, air conditioning and huge marble columns, 
some of them with elevators inside. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have accused the Roman Catholic president of building a "basilica in 
the bush" and an opulent backdrop for his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
But Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze rejected the charges as he addressed the 
Pope during the basilica's inaugural Mass. "Africans know that man does not 
live by bread alone," Arinze said. 
</P>
<P>
"An African may not have a good house, but he rejoices to see a beautiful house 
of God. . . . We Africans have our poor, our sick, our hungry, our homeless and 
our refugees," Arinze said. 
</P>
<P>
"But these suffering Africans appreciate the value of giving God our best. They 
realize that nothing is too expensive to offer to God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican sources said earlier this year the Pope accepted the gift only after 
the president agreed to the Pope's suggestion that a hospital and social 
services center be built on the complex. 
</P>
<P>
For the papal Mass, the indoor part of the basilica was packed with about 
10,000 people while 80,000 others sat in an outdoor section flanked by large 
columns in an oval shape resembling St. Peter's Square.

<P>
Yasser Arafat's guerrillas controlled the largest Palestinian refugee camp in 
Lebanon today after crushing followers of the notorious terrorist mastermind 
Abu Nidal in three days of savage combat. 
</P>
<P>
Police said at least 80 people have been killed and 250 wounded since Friday, 
when Arafat's mainstream guerrillas cracked down on the Revolutionary Council 
of Fatah in the Ein el Hilweh shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting reached its peak Sunday when the Palestine Liberation Organization 
fighters fought hand to hand to root out the last of Abu Nidal's followers 
hiding in a tunnel network under the camp. 
</P>
<P>
The guns fell silent after the 12-hour battle on the southeastern flank of the 
port city of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political representative here, Zeid Wehbe, said today that Abu Nidal 
followers who sought refugee in Sidon should be removed because "their presence 
in the city is an explosive destabilization factor." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at his Ein el Hilweh residence, Wehbe accused Abu Nidal's 
men of triggering Friday's fighting by kidnaping five Fatah activists. 
</P>
<P>
Other PLO officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said dozens of Abu 
Nidal's dissidents were being sheltered by Sunni Muslim fundamentalist leaders 
in Sidon.

Stock prices soared in Tokyo today, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index 
posting its sixth-largest daily gain in response to the U.S.-Soviet summit, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 139.43 yen after ranging 
between 139.33 yen and 139.65 yen. Today's close -- down 0.82 yen from Friday 
-- was the lowest in Tokyo since Oct. 2, when the U.S. currency finished 
trading at 139.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Index rose 1,118.83 points, or 4.67%, ending the day 
at 25,080.90. An estimated 330 million shares traded hands on the market's 
first section. 
</P>
<P>
Today's sixth-largest single-day increase followed a 150.16-point rise Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Nikkei index began rising sharply in response to the outcome 
of the summit Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, where President Bush and Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed on responses to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

PIZZA HUT TURNS OVER A LOT OF DOUGH IN CHINESE DEBUT

China's first Pizza Hut opened today in Beijing and served 200 pizzas to an 
invitation-only crowd of Chinese and foreigners before running out of dough. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, the restaurant was turning away guests. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the dough to rise, so it'll take about an hour," one 
waitress said. Other waitresses said there would be a two-hour wait. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Foo, general manager of Beijing Pizza Corp. Ltd., which operates the 
outlet, said more guests turned up than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, 180-seat restaurant expects to serve about 285 pizzas daily, 
mainly to foreign tourists and foreign residents of Beijing. Most Chinese have 
never eaten pizza, and many do not like cheese, which is alien to the Chinese 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, pizza has been available only in a few joint-venture hotels in 
China, which do not allow free access to ordinary Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
But company Chairman Jiang Tinzhi said the new Pizza Hut also hopes to attract 
Chinese customers. "Pizzas have been accepted by other Asian communities, and 
they will be accepted in China as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrific. It's delicious," said 16-year-old Liu Mei, one of the first 
customers, who had never eaten a pizza before. 
</P>
<P>
But some Chinese standing outside said the price was too high. The cost of a 
pizza is the equivalent of about $4.60. 
</P>
<P>
"That's almost one-sixth of my (monthly) salary. I have to save before I can 
bring my 3-year-old son here to have a meal," one man said. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Pizza Corp. Ltd. is a $1-million joint venture between the Hong 
Kong-based AMIT Ltd., which holds 60%, and the Beijing International Business 
Services Corp. The partnership holds a 15-year franchise from the U.S.-based 
Pizza Hut chain, a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
William Heinecke, vice chairman of the joint-venture company, predicted the 
restaurant will become profitable after three years. 
</P>
<P>
Cheese, spices and tomato paste are being imported, and other ingredients will 
be bought locally, he said.

E. GERMANS WILL SELL SOVIETS $636 MILLION IN SURPLUS GOODS

<P>
East Germany's troubled farmers got a break today when the government announced 
a $636-million deal to sell food and cigarettes to the shortage-plagued Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will allow farmers to get rid of some of the unsold produce and meat 
that have been jamming storerooms and slaughterhouses in the last several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
East German stores have been spurning home-grown goods in favor of Western 
products. 
</P>
<P>
About 255,000 tons of meat, 60,000 tons of butter, 5,000 tons of fish and more 
than 1 million eggs are included in the estimated $636-million contract with 
the Soviet Union, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the deal is sales of 1 billion cigarettes. The Soviet Union 
has been plagued by unrest over mass shortages of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was announced by government officials and West German Agriculture 
Minister Ignaz Kiechle, who will be in charge of East Germany's crumbling farm 
economy after the two nations unify on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and continue through 
June. 
</P>
<P>
East German farms -- Soviet-style collectives that are typically over-staffed 
-- have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their payrolls and operating 
costs since the nation switched to a free market on July 1.

Leaders of the New York Post's nine labor unions were briefed today on the 
financial records of the newspaper before beginning round-the-clock 
negotiations to save the paper from closure next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Post management opened its financial records to the accounting firm of Peat 
Marwick over the weekend so the unions could verify publisher Peter Kalikow's 
claim that he is losing $27 million a year on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Kalikow has said he expects the unions to make concessions totaling $17 million 
to $20 million so he can continue to publish the 189-year-old Post, the 
nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper.

Representatives from the black African states are to meet next month to discuss 
the readmission of South Africa to the world of international athletics, an 
IAAF official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a two-day weekend meeting of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation Council, the official said South Africa's readmission to the 
federation will be discussed at a meeting after the African championships in 
Cairo in October. 
</P>
<P>
"If African countries say 'yes,' we have no problem," he said. "But we are not 
going to interfere. We just support the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
An IAAF spokesman in London said the Cairo meeting would be followed "as soon 
as possible" by talks at the IAAF's African headquarters in Senegal, to which 
the South Africans would also be invited. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa was excluded from the IAAF in 1976, part of the almost total 
sporting isolation of the country for its apartheid policies. 
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week 
that South Africa will be readmitted to the Olympics for the 1996 Games -- and 
could even return in time for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Moscow, the Lithuanian soccer team Zalgiris was been ordered not 
to tour South Africa in accordance with an international ban on sports ties 
with the racially segregated nation. 
</P>
<P>
Vytautas Dirmeikis, secretary of the Lithuanian soccer union, announced the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The Zalgiris team will not go to the South African tour," he said. "The final 
decision to ban its trip was made by the Lithuanian Soccer Union, the 
Lithuanian National Olympic Committee and the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on 
Monday."

PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER NFL DOORMATS GREET THE NEW SEASON WITH WINS. GLANVILLE'S 
FALCONS PUNISH HOUSTON.

<P>
A new season, new players, new coaches and new results -- Tampa Bay, Atlanta 
and Dallas all won on opening day; the Rams, Broncos and Vikings all lost. 
</P>
<P>
And the Giants beat the Eagles for the first time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking debut was turned in by an old guy turned new guy -- Jerry 
Glanville, now coaching Atlanta, who had his Falcons pumped up for his old 
team, the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Final, 47-27, and a characteristic Glanville stat for Atlanta -- 16 penalties 
for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were flying at us," said Houston linebacker Robert Lyles. "There were 
guys jumping all over the pile." 
</P>
<P>
On one play, a short pass late in the game, nine black shirts were on the pile 
and only two were standing by -- one of them Deion Sanders, who later returned 
an interception 82 yards, prancing the last 20. 
</P>
<P>
AS FOR ROOKIES: Jeff George, the No. 1 pick in the draft, got a swift 
introduction to the regular season. He was 13 of 24 for 160 yards and a 
touchdown in a 26-10 loss in Buffalo. He also was sacked three times and 
knocked out of the game with a concussion with 11:48 to go when he was hit by 
Cornelius Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Broussard, the Falcons' No. 1 pick, ran 17 times for 54 yards, scored on 
a 6-yard run and left the game briefly with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Hampton of the Giants caught four passes for 26 yards, including a 
12-yard TD pass from Phil Simms, and rushed six times for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Green of Cincinnati carried five times for 22 yards and caught two 
passes for 5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Cortez Kennedy, signed less than a week ago, had four tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago safety Mark Carrier, a USC product, had three tackles and an assist and 
Percy Snow, Kansas City's No. 1, had three tackles, an assist and a sack as the 
Chiefs beat Minnesota 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay's Keith McCants had one assist. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDUP: Sunday's 13 games, played under the NFL's new speed-up rules, averaged 
3 hours and four minutes, including the 3:49 that Houston, Atlanta and the 
officials spent sorting out penalties and other oddities. Seven of the games 
came in under three hours, the shortest the 2:50 it took the Bucs to beat the 
Lions, 38-21.

Jury selection began today in the trial of a Detroit bar owner charged with 
drunk driving in the crash that killed New York Yankees manager Billy Martin 
last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
William Reedy, 53, a longtime friend of the five-time Yankees manager, is 
charged with driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of jurors is expected to take the entire day and the trial could 
last up to seven days, Town of Fenton court clerk Brooke Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy, who owns Reedy's Bar near Tiger Stadium, pleaded innocent to the 
drunk-driving charge in January. Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen 
and Reedy's lawyer, Jon Blechman, have refused to reveal the results of a 
voluntary blood-alcohol test taken by Reedy. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's wife, Jilluann, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the town of 
Fenton and Reedy.

MELVIN DURSLAG: DONAHUE MIGHT BE KICKING HIMSELF BLUE FOR PASSING UP GOLD

It was only a couple of years ago that the Atlanta Falcons cranked up and 
offered a treasure to Terry Donahue of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta wanted Donahue to coach its football team, proceeding at the time as if 
it wasn't coached at all. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking very heavy bank notes, folks, like upward of half a million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Other pro teams had invited Terry to dance. For instance, before he went out 
and put the gaff on Marv Levy, the owner of the Buffalo Bills had shown a 
serious interest in the UCLA coach. 
</P>
<P>
So, it transpires, Donahue says "no" to Atlanta, as he had to others, 
explaining his roots were fastened in Westwood, where he had developed a large 
romance with the school and its boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Your correspondent, the well-known agitator, asks him if the school and its 
boosters will return his love if he goes, say, 4-7, instead of taking the team 
to bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you should have taken that pro money and left the state," he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Terry shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess time will tell whether I played it right," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Bruins established a record last year of 3-7-1. Followers groaned and 
blamed a multitude of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, they opened the new season against Oklahoma and took a sizable 
pratfall. 
</P>
<P>
And they looked bad in the process, leaving you to wonder if they will be 
noticeably better this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
And if Donahue hits that inevitable down cycle, so indigenous to his line of 
work, will those in charge remain tolerant? 
</P>
<P>
How will they respond if he reminds them he could have left and pulled down big 
cabbage at Atlanta? 
</P>
<P>
On a newspaper on which we once worked, a baseball writer was informed he was 
being uncoupled. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do that," he protested. "I turned down the New York Times five years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
He was told, "You shouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
It is the meteorological history of the Los Angeles area that September is the 
hottest month. The atmosphere grows dense and generally miserable. Temperatures 
rise into the 90s, if not beyond 100, and, on weather reports, you hear that 
celebrated reminder, "Air in the basin today is unhealthful." 
</P>
<P>
So a guy dropping in from the Tonga group asks idly: 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they starting football games at 12:30 and one o'clock in the 
afternoon? Or why aren't early season games for Los Angeles teams booked on the 
road?" 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the Rose Bowl, where UCLA was engaging Oklahoma, temperatures 
on the field were soaring to 107. For football, that is cruel and inhuman. 
</P>
<P>
That's about what temperatures run on the Saudi desert. The only difference is, 
forces there don't have an option, whereas one exists in football. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coliseum, where the Raiders were matched against Denver, temperatures 
rose as high as 105. 
</P>
<P>
You would see Howie Long stagger to the sideline, requiring an oxygen mask. A 
doctor took his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
And, soon afterward, John Elway would repair to the pits, so wholly drained he 
was almost ill to his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Is it football they are trying to play in September around here, or is it some 
kind of survival contest? 
</P>
<P>
Fans were exposed to gross discomfort because television contracts wouldn't 
permit a change to, say, 5 p.m. kickoffs when forecasts called for this 
unbearable heat. 
</P>
<P>
If it usually happens that NFL schedule-makers try to avoid late-season games 
in Buffalo, for reasons that needn't be explained, why, on Sept. 9, would they 
arrange a game in Los Angeles at 1 p.m.? 
</P>
<P>
Players would prefer Buffalo in December to Los Angeles in September. The air 
in Buffalo could kill you, but it is never described as unhealthful. 
</P>
<P>
For their season opener with Denver, the Raiders drew a crowd of 54,000 -- 
surprisingly good -- and, more important, it was a surprisingly enthusiastic 
crowd, casting its lot with the home side through a large part of the match. 
</P>
<P>
When the offense produced no points, the fans supported the defense, which 
would come up with the two touchdowns that beat the Broncos, 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 54,000 is a sellout in Oakland, but is rated an undersized perch you 
would throw back in the palmy days of pro football in Los Angeles, where the 
Rams once set a league record for a season with an 83,000 average. 
</P>
<P>
At Denver, where capacity runs roughly 74,000, the Broncos now have sold out 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The waiting list for tickets has grown to 13,000 and, the way genii of the box 
office figure, each customer buys an average of three tickets (meaning some buy 
two, others four). 
</P>
<P>
So Denver calculates it could draw almost 40,000 more to each home game if it 
had room. 
</P>
<P>
Then Denver has another major advantage over the Raiders: namely, 60 luxury 
suites, selling at an average price of $85,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
This means Denver opens each season with $5 million more in the kick than Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Every team in the AFC West has luxury boxes except the Raiders, a deficiency 
the club is attempting to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
When, in a jump-off of sorts, that kind of loot goes into the air each year -- 
and keeps escaping the Raiders -- they get depressed and come to feel the least 
the Kuwaitis can do is finance this shortage.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: TRAINMAN PLAYS FAVORITES FLAVORED BY A PROGRESSION OF 
WIN-PLACE BETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Trainman," a well-known husky individual with a broad reddish face and 
reddish-gray hair was well-known in the Grandstand at Hollywood Park this past 
season, and is equally known to the hard-core racing fans now at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Trainman because of his former job, which was to ride the rails for 
the government as a security guard in train cars carrying mail, he worked for 
40 years and then retired with a pension that adequately keeps him in gambling 
money. What the Trainman is proud of is that in his entire 40 years, although 
he carried a gun, he never once had to use it. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, going to the track generates the excitement needed by the 
Trainman, who would find retirement very boring if he couldn't make a bet or 
two on the ponies, since he doesn't read anymore, doesn't care for movies and 
only watches the news programs on television in the evenings. What he has 
stored up over the years from reading a great deal of mindless material while 
riding around on trains is lots of trivia, which he likes to show off by 
playing games with his cronies when they get together on weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
But since going to the track every day could result in huge losses, if the 
Trainman were to just wager on his own selections, he has devised a system that 
usually wins a little more than it loses after a season of play. 
</P>
<P>
The Trainman loves to play the favorites every race, claiming that they at 
least win from 28% to 33% of their races, which is as good as a newspaper 
handicapper might do. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of just making straight wagers to win, he combines a 
money-progression on win and place betting that he continues to bet until the 
favorite wins, continuing the progression even should he make a profit on the 
race. Once the favorite wins, he starts over with the first bet of the series. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence used by the Trainman is as follows: 
</P>
<P>
First race: $2 win, $4 place.

What the Trainman likes about his system is that if the favorites don't win as 
often as he would like, then at least there's a good chance they will run 
second. And if they do, his purpose in betting to place is to either come out 
even on his per-race wagering or possibly to make a few bucks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best sessions for the system occurred on July 23, which was the last 
day of Hollywood Park's 67-day meeting. Stone House, running in the first race 
against maidens 3 years old and up, from post position No. 11, jumped into 
fifth place at the start of the six-furlong sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stone House fell back to eighth at the quarter-pole, he moved back up 
to fifth by the half-mile marker. In the stretch, Stone House was running third 
by 1 1/2 lengths and closing quickly on the leader. Just before the finish, 
Stone House leaped ahead to win by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
As the favorite, Stone House paid $5.20 to win and $3 to place. The Trainman 
collected $11.20 for his $6 wagered and was ahead $5.20 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Trainman also won the second race when the favorite, No Doubles Match, also 
running six furlongs, started out first from the No. 12 post position and 
quickly dropped back to third. At the half-mile pole, No Doubles Match was 
second and then took over first by a head when entering the stretch. He then 
extended his lead to finish 1 1/2 lengths in front. 
</P>
<P>
Paying $8 to win and $4.20 to place, the Trainman collected $16.40, made a 
$10.40 profit, and was ahead $15.60 after two races. The Trainman lost 80 cents 
on the third race when the favorite ran second and paid $2.60 to place. He also 
lost $12 on the fourth, when All Bets Off, the lukewarm favorite at $2.90 to 
$1, ran last. 
</P>
<P>
The Trainman then bet $5 to win and $10 to place on the favorite, Chief Runnin 
Blaze, in the fifth race and watched the nag fade back to sixth at the 
quarter-pole at 6 1/2 furlongs. Chief Runnin Blaze then moved up to third, took 
over first around the far turn and entered the stretch running easily. At the 
finish, Chief Runnin Blaze was two lengths in front and paid $6.60 to win and 
$4 to place. 
</P>
<P>
For his $15 wagered, the Trainman collected $36.50 and pocketed $21.50 on the 
race. Being only $2.80 ahead after the fourth race, the Trainman was now 
winning $24.30. Cutting back to a $6 bet ($2 win and $4 place) after the win, 
the Trainman won the sixth on Cuddles, who paid $6.40 to win and $3.80 to 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the $8 won to his winnings, the Trainman showed a profit of $32.30. He 
wagered $6 on the seventh race and watched as his horse, Dr. Brent, ended up 
second to pay $4.20 to place. Winning $2.40 on the race, the Trainman was ahead 
$34.70. 
</P>
<P>
Since he didn't win the seventh, the Trainman increased his bet to $12 ($4 win, 
$8 place) on the eighth. Petite Ile, the public choice, running 1 1/2 miles on 
the turf against 3-year-olds and up, took the lead at the start from the No. 9 
post position and went wire-to-wire. Although tiring at the finish, Petite Ile 
held off the second-place horse and won by half a length. 
</P>
<P>
The return for his $12 in bets hit $26 and the Trainman won $14 on the race. 
With one race to go, he was ahead $48.70. Agiwin turned out to be the favorite 
in the ninth, a 1 1/16-mile race on the turf for 4-year-olds and up. Agiwin ran 
fourth most of the way around the track until the stretch, where he made a bold 
move and finished first by a nose. The horse paid $7.40 to win and $4.40 to 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Betting $6 after a win, the Trainman collected $16.20, winning $10.20. Combined 
with the $48.70 already won, the Trainman left the track with a tidy $58.90 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
Although favorites are expected to win about every third or fourth race, 
nothing is certain when horses compete against one another. Despite what the 
experts say, the Trainman contends that statistics merely bolster history but 
reveal very little of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although the system seems to be working for the Trainman, he does worry that 
maybe on some days no favorite will run first or second. If that occurs, then 
the nine races would cost him a total of $222, which would be difficult to make 
up on his winning days. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the Trainman is prepared for that moment. It's like guarding the mail, 
he tells his cronies. "If the run goes smoothly one day, it doesn't mean that 
there won't be trouble the next. And if you happen to lose on the ponies one 
day, it doesn't mean you're not going to win the next!"

Lou Diamond Phillips' latest role is causing controversy among Navajos, but 
South Dakota Sioux are honoring the multiracial actor for his portrayals of 
American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The Sioux have given Phillips, 28, star of the 1987 film "La Bamba," the 
honorary name Starkeeper, publicist Eddie Michaels said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The tribe will officially confer the name on Phillips at a ceremony later this 
year in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts has challenged the casting 
of Phillips as a Navajo policeman in a film based on author Tony Hillerman's 
novel "The Dark Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who played a Mexican-Indian in "Young Guns" and "Young Guns II," has 
said he is part Cherokee, Filipino, Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Paradise, director of the American Indian Registry, said last week that 
Phillips had not provided documentation of his lineage.

Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite says he has something in common with every 
"red-blooded human being" -- a fascination with dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
Cronkite was doing his part last week to publicize the great beasts of the 
past, spending time in Montana to film a documentary series on dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fascinating project," he said as an international crew filmed a segment 
northwest of Great Falls, Mont. "It's something that I think will make an 
impact in America." 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour series produced by Canadian, British and German television will 
be shown in the United States on the Arts and Entertainment cable channel about 
a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
Cronkite, 73, spoke with owners of the Bynum Rock Shop, who found the bones of 
baby dinosaurs that led to discovery of a key fossil site. The crew has also 
filmed a fossil dig near Circle, Mont., where the most complete skeleton of a 
Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered two years ago.

YELLOW RIBBON CIVIL WAR REMINDER

Entertainer Tony Orlando feels something special for those yellow ribbons, the 
ubiquitous symbol of hope for loved ones held captive. 
</P>
<P>
The singer known for "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree" said in a 
telephone interview last week that he discovered the song's deep emotional 
effect shortly after it was released. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1973, and the group Dawn, featuring Orlando as lead singer, was the 
opening act at a Bob Hope show at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. About 400 or 500 
former prisoners of war were seated in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The song is based on a Civil War story about the homecoming of a Union soldier 
from a Confederate prison. In the song, the man is welcomed by yellow ribbons 
as he comes home from a stint in prison. The message moved the former POWs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on stage and I'm singing this song and all of a sudden it was the most 
spine-chilling moment," he said. "Up they got, off their chairs, and they're 
coming toward the stage and they come on stage and they begin to sing the 
song."
