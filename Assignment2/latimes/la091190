AL MARTINEZ: LO, THE NAKED INDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You remember Ruth Simmons. She was the painfully shy Colorado housewife who, 
under hypnosis, broke into a wild Irish jig and announced in a rich brogue that 
she was Bridey Murphy of 19th-Century Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Al Martinez. He is the former Oakland person who, under hypnosis, 
announced in his usual mumble that he was Yazoo, a naked Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it isn't clear what I said, due to a hereditary inability to 
articulate. Even when I am not under hypnosis, I seem to be saying my name is 
Elmer Teenez or, in some cases, Omar Teemus. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Bridey made quite a splash in 1952. It was the beginning of a 
reincarnation fad. There was a Bridey Murphy book, a Bridey Murphy cocktail and 
God knows how many come-as-you-were parties. 
</P>
<P>
Except for scattered periods of interest thereafter, the fad went the way of 
hot pants and the Nehru jacket. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
The movie "Flatliners" has created new interest in the near-death experience 
and, hence, in the afterlife generally, including reincarnation. 
</P>
<P>
After mentioning it recently, I received telephone calls from those who had 
either experienced near-death or had been regressed to a past life. 
</P>
<P>
One person offered to send me tumbling back through time to my own earlier 
existence. I couldn't resist the temptation. Float along as best you can. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Grace Coveney and she's an exorcist. Well, actually, while she did 
rid a house of ghosts once, she's more of a general psychic than an exorcist, 
with a specialty in past-life regression. 
</P>
<P>
We met at her home in the Valley, where a lot of psychics seem to live, and she 
hypnotized and led me back in time to my prior life. 
</P>
<P>
This was accomplished by putting me through a psychic tunnel. A similar 
technique was used in "Flatliners," at the end of which a kind of demonic 
conscience symbol named Billy Mahoney (Joshua Rudoy) was waiting to beat hell 
out of the character played by Kiefer Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
I met Joshua in person later. He's a decent young man of 14 who seems 
disinclined to fly into anyone's face like a psychopathic cat, kicking and 
yowling. But I still don't want him waiting at the end of my tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, there was only Yazoo at the end, and . . . well, listen to a 
snippet of tape made during my regression. Coveney is asking the questions: 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who are you? 
</P>
<P>
A. (Unintelligible.) 
</P>
<P>
Q. What? 
</P>
<P>
A. (Mumbled) Yazoo. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Yalu? 
</P>
<P>
A. (Louder) Yazoo! 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where do you live, Yazoo? 
</P>
<P>
A. Forest. Naked. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You're naked in a forest? What are you doing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Woman bathing. Naked. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You're watching a naked woman bathe? 
</P>
<P>
A. In river. (I make a yummy sound here.) 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you look like? 
</P>
<P>
A. Brown. Muscles. Black hair. Naked. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Yes, well, is there anyone else in the forest? 
</P>
<P>
A. Animals. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I see. How did you die? 
</P>
<P>
A. Old. Naked. 
</P>
<P>
Other than an apparent preoccupation with nudity, I seemed relatively normal. 
Even my voice, though characteristically garbled, remained much as it is in my 
. . . well . . . present life. I never fell into the me-Yazoo stage. 
</P>
<P>
I realize my description as brown, muscled and black-haired could have made me, 
say, a naked Puerto Rican, but subsequent questions established me firmly in 
the Indian camp. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I asked a psychologist with an expertise in hypnotherapy what he thought 
of all this. His name is Michael Aharoni and he gave me a well-maybe answer. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that people like Shirley MacLaine are firm believers in 
reincarnation, while others are equally skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it's possible we've had past lives," Aharoni says. "There's really 
no proof either way, but you've got to wonder where something like Yazoo, the 
naked Indian, comes from." 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, he says, it doesn't really matter where it originates, from 
memory or imagination, because it's all useful in making our lives somehow 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Mine is better already. When asked in my Yazoo state about the "other side," I 
found it serene with perfect weather and a little dull. Kind of like San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The one disadvantage to the hereafter, according to Yazoo, is you have to live 
off the land. I'm thinking of taking a rifle, a portable barbecue and some A-1 
Sauce when I go. Indian or not, I don't eat raw meat.

SWIMMING IN HANDGUNS; 
</P>
<P>
BEACH SHOOTING ILLUSTRATES ANEW NEED FOR EDUCATION ON GUN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life for teen-agers is filled with possibility and, from the vantage point of a 
boogie board, it may at times seem indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
But two surfers got into an argument on a beach in Orange County last weekend, 
and now only one is alive -- thanks to a gun. We need to take stock of how 
flooded society is with guns when, in broad daylight, the storied and peaceable 
world of surfers is violated by a shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
It happened on a hot Saturday afternoon in Dana Point when a long-simmering 
quarrel between two teen-agers broke out into violence. The fatal shooting was 
triggered by a dispute over who did what to whom between two youngsters whose 
comrades on the beach knew of the feud but seemed powerless to resolve it. The 
16-year-old suspect who was carrying a pistol is now in custody. He was packing 
a piece, he had earlier told pals, because he was afraid for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities will want to determine how this youngster could so easily get a 
gun. They will want to determine why there wasn't anyone there who had the 
sense to intervene and try to mediate this dispute. From the accounts of 
eyewitnesses, there were several moments before the shooting when the conflict 
could have been resolved, or at the least, a death avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Now one youngster is a murder suspect, too young even to have his name made 
public. The other surfer is dead at 18. Neither youth seemed to fully 
understand the potential for a gun -- surfacing on a sunny, wave-caressed beach 
-- to produce death. And so the shooting on a crowded beach offers more 
sickening evidence of the menace of guns in our culture. 
</P>
<P>
A similar story unfolded in Los Angeles last weekend, when a boy, 11, a girl, 
16, and two adults were killed by suspected gang-related gunfire. We need more 
effective gun-control legislation and a broad assault on the entire culture of 
the handgun: Teen-agers need to learn that bullets really kill. Even when life 
seems just to be a day at the beach.

There are a pile of bills passed by the state Legislature sitting on Gov. 
George Deukmejian's desk that would be law but for the flourish of his pen. 
Some are worthy ones indeed; here are three: 
</P>
<P>
CLEAN BILL: More than 1 million automobiles in the state manage to escape 
California's widely applauded Smog Check program because of a loophole. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation worked up by Assembyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento) and Sen. 
Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would close it and improve air quality -- with no 
cost to the general fund and only a one dollar hike in the inspection fee. 
</P>
<P>
SAFE BILL: Minivans may be great fun and an effective means of family 
transportation, but not all minivans are alike. Some models do not comply with 
minimum safety standards. A bill (AB 3998) before Deukmejian would require 
manufacturers, dealers and rental agents to disclose information on whether a 
given make and model make the safety grade. Mom and Dad should be able to know 
what they're buying or renting. 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY BILL: An industry still very much in an infant stage of development 
needs every possible boost from its governmental parents. Two bills (AB 4090, 
SB 86) would provide tax-credit incentives to the kind of solar-power 
development so vital to this state. California has offered solar-tax credits 
since 1977, and it is no surprise that we lead the world in solar power. But 
the credits were allowed to lapse. Let's keep the lead and show the way to a 
future that's less dependent on foreign oil suppliers that sometimes want to 
turn us off.

'RESISTANCE TO GAY COPS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chief Daryl F. Gates should be applauded for his stand on LAPD's recruitment 
policies. Granted, gays and lesbians are people, too, and it's not that I 
harbor any ill feelings toward them; it's their lifestyle that bothers me. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer is someone who must be beyond the whims of society. He/she has 
to be a professional, someone who when called upon will do what is right. 
He/she wears a uniform that carries with it a certain amount of respect, 
authority and influence. That influence can be used to enhance another person's 
life or mislead it. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips mentioned that Mitch Grobeson left the force because his life was 
threatened. I sympathize with and at the same time give him credit for at least 
attempting to become something he is not, a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
It must be recognized that if LAPD openly recruit gays, they are saying to the 
men and women, boys and girls of this city as well as the world that the gay 
lifestyle is OK and perfectly acceptable. Is it?

MALATHION TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the Metro article (Aug. 29) on malathion: "In an interview, (Los Angeles 
County health official Dr. Paul) Papanek said the urine testing is being done 
to support the state's contention that the amount of malathion absorbed by the 
body after spraying does not pose a health threat." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of science is this? Bad, unscientific and a definite conflict of 
interest. Self-monitoring or self-testing are no substitutes for independent 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's the self-monitoring by agencies of their sewage being discharged 
into Santa Monica Bay or justifying a state policy to spray malathion over an 
unwilling and vulnerable populace, we must insist on impartial, truly 
scientific evaluations.

THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL: A PRIMAL TERROR RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHING: I'M A TEACHER OF THIRD-GRADERS, AND TONIGHT I WILL FEEL LIKE A 
THIRD-GRADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LANTOS, Jeff Lantos is a teacher at Hancock Park Elementary School in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing this on the last night of summer vacation. School starts tomorrow, 
and even though I'm 37 years old and have been teaching for several years, I'm 
still filled with that gnawing unease that I felt on these same nights many 
years ago and many miles distant. 
</P>
<P>
It is, and was, a kind of performance anxiety, I suppose, not all that 
different from stage fright. As a teacher, and as a student, you have to show 
up that first day, you have to deliver and you have to maintain your poise no 
matter what they throw at you. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, in the wee hours, after I peek at the clock and punch my pillow, my 
mind will wander back to those early September nights in western Pennsylvania, 
25, 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The night before school, my mother and I laid out my clothes on the end of the 
bed. My father wandered in and reminded me how important it was to make a good 
impression on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
I popped up before the alarm, thinking I'd overslept. When I saw it was only 5 
o'clock, I dozed off, only to be awakened again by my father's gargling. That 
day I envied him his workaday routine. He didn't have to face new teachers and 
prove himself all over again. Once I said to him, "You don't know what pressure 
is." 
</P>
<P>
My mother, in her bathrobe and slippers, was already in the kitchen when I came 
downstairs. There was a glass of orange juice at my place and French toast was 
sizzling on the grill. She promised that she would be home at 3 o'clock to hear 
all about my day. 
</P>
<P>
At 7, the whistle at the downtown Bethlehem Steel plant blew and echoed through 
the valley. At 7:20 or so, I kissed my mom and headed out. 
</P>
<P>
The ground was dewy, and the first hint of autumn chilled the hazy, sulfuric 
air. I wore penny loafers; new and stiff, they crunched with every step. At the 
bus stop, I waited with kids I hadn't seen since June. Finally, the bus came 
into view and pulled curbside. I got on, flashed my bus pass and plopped onto a 
springy, squeaky seat next to the one guy I could talk to. 
</P>
<P>
The smells of that first day stay with me. The buffed hallway floors, the 
metallic lockers, the woody pencil shavings, the musty books, the fresh book 
covers, the Prell shampoo on the girl in front of me, the boiled hot dogs in 
the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
It was hot during seventh period. It was still summer. On my book receipts, I 
wrote the date, and as I did, I could feel the year sprawling out before me. It 
seemed endless. Christmas was months away. June was inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
Traumatic events leave a deep imprint in our minds. There must be some cerebral 
circuit that sizzles with current when we face danger, risk or the unknown. In 
my childhood -- a relatively safe, secure childhood -- there could not have 
been many nights more fraught with tension than the one before the first day of 
school. Being older, less vulnerable and of the system, doesn't lessen the 
fear. The dread I feel is encoded in my mental wiring and can't be explained 
away. And so tonight I will lie in bed, and when I sleep I will dream of 
standing in front of my class with no pants on, and when I awake I will see 
I've slept for only 90 minutes. I'm a teacher of third-graders, and tonight I 
will feel like a third-grader, and the only cure is the school bell that 
announces the end of the first day.

PROFESSIONALS, NOT CLONES IN BLUE; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: LAPD OFFICERS HOLD SIMILAR VALUES BECAUSE UNIFORMITY SAVES LIVES. IT'S 
NOT A QUESTION OF INSENSITIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN YOCUM, Susan Yocum is an LAPD patrol officer in the Rampart division. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent survey of Los Angeles police officers' attitudes, values and 
experiences has drawn criticism that reveals only the ignorance of the critics. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Claremont Graduate School, was aimed at assessing the 
impact of the 1980 consent decrees demanding the hiring of minorities and 
women. It concluded that even the department's newly diverse officers share 
similar opinions about their jobs and ideals, and that their personal values 
mirror the department's. 
</P>
<P>
This is unremarkable. Los Angeles Police Department values are in no way 
political or controversial. They concern respecting the law, respecting the 
citizenry and respecting the power and responsibility given us by that 
citizenry. The department's values are ideals, aimed at by all but fully 
attained by none. Sometimes we overreact. Sometimes we don't react adequately. 
Los Angeles police, like everyone else, are not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
The department's critics bemoan the uniformity that still exists despite the 
hiring of unprecedented numbers of women and minorities, implying that 
standardization is synonymous with insensitivity. The NAACP accuses the 
department of forcing an "LAPD view of the world" on its officers. The ACLU's 
opinion is that the "tactics of the police are just as brutal" as ever. A 
criminal-justice professor summarily dismisses police officers, saying "they're 
all clones." 
</P>
<P>
These critics reveal a poor understanding of police officers, naivete about 
street reality and a shallow knowledge of management principles -- especially 
with regard to police work. Standardization and unity of purpose will be found 
in any successful corporation or small business. The fact that they exist in 
the Los Angeles Police Department is therefore a mark of success in dealing 
with radical changes in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the LAPD has exceeded the hiring recommendations of the 
consent decrees. The department's remarkable integration of these women and 
minorities into the organization is indicated by the study's finding that all 
officers experience similar successes (in terms of commendations) and failures 
(in terms of complaints). Commendations and complaints are, for the most part, 
generated by citizens. The department could not possibly have engineered these 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Street reality is unpredictable and respects no sexual or ethnic difference. 
Responding to an emergency, I must be certain of my role in containing the 
crisis. I must know how my partner will react because often there is no time to 
discuss plans. I must predict how my fellow officers will deploy. My faith in 
the officer supervising the scene has to be both blind and assured. We can 
never know what the suspect will do. We must know what we will do. Acting as an 
individual on the streets will likely result in an officer's or an innocent 
citizen's death. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that we act as a unit, training is standardized. But six months in 
the academy is barely sufficient to cover the essentials of law, report 
writing, physical training, Spanish language, firearms instruction, tactics and 
cultural awareness. Officers are then dispatched to 18 different divisions, 
where there is scarcely enough time to handle the calls for service. There is 
no omnipotent administration with either the power or the opportunity to 
brainwash officers. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of sensitivity is simply not a logical conclusion to be drawn from the 
questions Claremont asked in its study. If sensitivity is to be measured, then 
ask about our families. Ask about our hobbies. Ask what books we read, what 
movies we watch. Ask what churches we attend -- or don't attend. Ask how we 
feel when seeing an innocent 12-year-old victim of a drive-by shooting, 
crumpled lifeless in the street. Ask what we think when we must tell a mother 
her son was senselessly slain. There will be 8,100 different answers to these 
questions. There is a wide range of emotional responses to the situations that 
we see daily. That they are acted upon with unity marks professionalism, not 
vacuous insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, there may always be officers who react without restraint or 
compassion. But to accuse the department of maintaining brutality ignores the 
dangerous reality of our job. Often and increasingly, our actions are a 
necessary response to horrific situations. To confuse this with 
institutionalized brutality foisted upon impressionable officers is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If the Los Angeles Police Department were smart enough to clone its officers, 
it would be smart enough to clone perfect ones.

THE IDEOLOGICAL BASES FOR EARLIER SOVIET POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED; THE 
POLICIES THEMSELVES WILL BE HARDER TO RETIRE.

<P>
Their cordial personal relationship notwithstanding, Presidents Bush and 
Gorbachev are not about to forge a common Middle East policy. Their meeting 
Sunday marked a major departure in Soviet-American relations, but it provided 
no ready answer for solving the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union share the aim of defusing the regional 
conflict, but their national interests in the Middle East are as divergent now 
as they were before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. While it is reasonable to expect 
that the two superpowers have in common concerns for world peace and the need 
to defeat aggressor states, it is not reasonable to expect that they will have 
common national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the differences between U.S. and Soviet foreign-policy 
goals in the region were justified largely in ideological terms. We backed 
Israel, and, especially after 1967, the Soviet Union redoubled its support of 
the Arab world. Many of Israel's enemies were "progressive" Arab socialist 
regimes, with some ideological goals in common with the Soviet Union. This made 
it even easier for the Soviets to side not just with the Arabs, but more 
particularly with the Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ideological justification of earlier Soviet policies has been formally 
abandoned, but the policies themselves will be harder to retire. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has defined the Persian Gulf as vital to our strategic 
concerns, but the Soviets have a physical presence in the region and cannot 
pull back easily as the United States can. An energy-secure America might in 
the long run be forced to abandon the gulf oil fields, but Moscow must remain 
sensitive to the long Muslim border on its southern flank. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is itself a South Asian nation with a Muslim population of 50 
million, larger than that of the entire Arabian peninsula. More over, the 
Muslim population, which is approaching 20% of that of the Soviet Union as a 
whole, has been using the issue of republic sovereignty to become organized as 
a potentially powerful lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike America's pro-Israel lobby, this critical Soviet constituency does not 
as yet have well-articulated foreign-policy goals. But this simply compounds 
Gorbachev's problems, for he must try to anticipate the Soviet Muslims' future 
policy preferences, so as not to inadvertently cross them. 
</P>
<P>
The potential linkage between the Persian Gulf crisis and the rise of Islamic 
nationalism is troubling to both the United States and the Soviet Union. An 
escalation in the crisis could spark a wave of religious-inspired political 
activism that could lead to the overthrow of America's allies in the region. 
This same activism could further undermine a precarious internal situation in 
the Soviet Union, and threaten the millions of Russian living in the Muslim 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim population is still smarting from the Soviet Union's nearly 
decade-long military engagement in Afghanistan. No Russian leader could easily 
mobilize them to defend the nation's interests against a Muslim power. It would 
be difficult even to muster a predominantly Russian fighting force for service 
in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev was able to accept Bush's contention that U.S. security 
interests and international concerns more generally could be served by a 
U.S.-dominated regional military presence. And Bush accepted that there would 
not be direct Soviet involvement in non-U.N. organized police forces in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the differences between the United States and Soviet positions on how 
best to use the threat of force to contain Saddam Hussein comes from the 
vulnerability of Gorbachev's power base. In today's Soviet Union, concern for 
restoring economic order must take precedence over major initiatives in foreign 
policy. However, Gorbachev recognizes that, by dedicating himself to the 
reduction of international tensions, he will receive international support for 
his country's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
But real differences remain in the foreign-policy goals of the two nations. The 
United States remains committed to the existence of Israel at all costs, while 
the Soviet Union is more concerned with ensuring justice for the Palestinians. 
The United States wants to preserve the monarchies of the region, while the 
Soviet Union has taken pains not to harm relations with Syria or even to break 
its military contracts with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Soviet-American relations are now past the point of polemics. The 
Helsinki summit lacked drama but not significance. George Bush and Mikhail 
Gorbachev now can accept differences in each other's positions yet still work 
together. Ongoing dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union will 
help mediate conflict in the Middle East, but it cannot make the substantive 
differences between the two nations disappear.

FAY VINCENT RELAXES IN JOB BECAUSE HE LIKES IT

A question and answer session with baseball commissioner Fay Vincent: 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has this job been what you thought it would be? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: It's much better than I ever dreamed, in a sense that it's the most 
wonderful way to spend time that I could ever have imagined. If you have to get 
up in the morning and go to work, this is the job that you want. 
</P>
<P>
It's better than not working, because I don't have to work. If I didn't want to 
work, I wouldn't be here. It's a terrific amount of fun. And maybe it wouldn't 
be for all people. But for me, I love baseball. I don't think anybody should be 
here who doesn't have a great affection for the game itself, who doesn't enjoy 
going to the game and sitting through rain delays. If you don't like baseball 
you shouldn't be working for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It's as close to perfection in terms of a way to spend time as I can imagine. 
And I say that given the perception that is widely held that I had a terribly 
tumultuous and difficult year. I don't view it that way. I think in this 
position there's going to be problems. People say, 'Well, you've had a bad 
year.' And I say, 'Look ahead.' Now we have the umpire negotiations coming, we 
have a major negotiation with the minor leagues on the player development 
contract, we've got expansion. Those are three issues I'm going to have to deal 
with that are not easy. But that's what the job involves. On the other hand, 
tonight I go out to Shea, I can hang around, talk a little baseball, have some 
fun, that's fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But it has been an extraordinary year, wouldn't you say? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Well, for me it hasn't in a sense that it is about what you expect. I 
think the only surprise to me was that the pace that the issues came was a more 
compacted time frame than I might have expected. I might have expected a little 
more distance there. It turns out they come like waves. There's not much 
distance between the waves. They just keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But these were big waves. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yes, big waves. But I think there are big waves coming. See, I don't 
believe that there's clear water in this job. I don't think we're going to get 
to easy going. I just don't think it's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You have a unique set of characteristics that allow you to say this job is 
not as punishing as it appears, in that it seems you don't owe favors to 
anybody in this job, you don't seem to have an ego need and you probably don't 
need the job. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yeah, I think you're on to something. It is very helpful to me to be 
in the position I am in both financially and professionally. I came to Columbia 
(Pictures) broke and left financially independent into the third generation. 
</P>
<P>
Having that advantage means I don't have an agenda, if you will. I'm not trying 
to achieve the next job, I'm not running for anything. It's very clear. But if 
it becomes obvious that somebody can do this better, I'll go to Cape Cod and do 
something else for a while. 
</P>
<P>
I'm willing to take direction and criticism. But, when push comes to shove, 
everybody knows I'm doing it because I want to do it. And if the day comes when 
I don't want to do it or somebody persuades me that I should no longer do it, I 
will be a very easy fellow to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How does (New York Yankee General Manager) Gene Michael resist George 
Steinbrenner? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: If Steinbrenner calls Michael, Michael comes to me and says, 'He did 
it.' If they talk about a subject that is not permitted or Michael is worried, 
the best thing to do is call me up. It's what I told George he should have done 
when he was dealing with (Howard) Spira. If George would have come here before 
he paid Spira, we would have had a different situation. He could have come to 
me and said, 'I've got this problem. I think I'm being extorted' -- taking his 
view -- 'I'm not sure I want to make the payment. What do you think I should 
do?' And I asked him why he didn't come here and he didn't give me much of an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is the Dave Winfield situation over? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: My view on the Winfield situation is that I have looked into it and 
had people look into what's been put in front of us. If somebody has 
information that I don't have, I will evaluate it and pursue it. That is true 
not just in Mr. Winfield's case, but anybody's case. So I mean, I don't know if 
it's over. I have nothing that leads me to believe there is anything 
significant that should be looked into that has not been previously looked 
into. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you distinguish what Winfield did with his relationship with Spira 
and what you thought was a mistake by Steinbrenner? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: It's very simple. David Winfield dropped Spira and the reason Spira 
went to Mr. Steinbrenner is because he was furious at Winfield for telling him 
to get lost. Winfield did not want to deal with him. When he learned what Spira 
was, he said he'd have nothing more to do with him. That's a significant 
difference. Secondly, there is no credible evidence that Winfield knew that 
Spira was a gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When you sit down with Steinbrenner in February, will the agreement be 
changed in any way or is the meeting just to outline, 'You can go to X number 
of games.' 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: What I said was he was totally free to ask me to sit down and ask for 
permission to go to games in ways that were different than from just going as a 
fan and sitting in the stands. I have no commitment to giving such permission. 
That will have to await the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you still puzzled what his thinking was? Have you figured that out? You 
were going to act otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: (I) have not complained about the agreement I signed. I understood 
what I was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The scenario where Steve Kaufman, his lawyer, stuck his arm in the elevator, 
that's true? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yeah, because they were screwing around. Enough's enough. Either you 
sign the agreement or you don't. I couldn't care less. I don't need anybody to 
sign the suspension. What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
Q: But there was no haste, was there? That perhaps George didn't know what he 
was signing? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: I mean, he's represented by three lawyers. They were here from 9 in 
the morning to 8 at night. It should not have taken that long. My view was -- 
and I told them they weren't prepared -- if they had an agreement they wanted 
they should have brought it over here, prepared it in advance. They didn't do 
that. They didn't do their work. 
</P>
<P>
We wrote the agreement, Steve (Greenberg, deputy commissioner) and I. I'm happy 
to do that. But if you don't want to sign it, don't sign it. I don't care. I 
mean, I offered them that. If they don't want it, terrific. I'll do what I have 
to do. I don't need his agreement to anything. If he wanted an agreement, fine. 
I offered him one. He didn't have to sign it. There was no coercion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You had called the retorts from his camp "cymbals crashing in the night." Is 
that over? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: I don't know. They're still out there trying to persuade you to write 
about it. There's nothing to write about. They're trying to say the 
investigation wasn't fair. Why did he sign? He accepted the findings and pled 
guilty. When you plead guilty you can't complain about the process. It's over. 
That's it. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the (Pete) Rose people were much smarter. When they pled guilty and 
they took their punishment, they stopped. Because they recognized if you want 
to come back to baseball there's no point in banging around and doing all this. 
Even the Rose people understood that. These people don't understand that. He 
(Steinbrenner) can't go to a ballgame next year without my permission. Is this 
helpful? 
</P>
<P>
Q: There is also speculation that he wanted to preserve his position on the 
U.S. Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: After reading my opinion, he thought he was going to preserve his 
position? Read the opinion. I mean, if you sit on the Olympic committee and 
read my opinion, do you want that? 
</P>
<P>
Q: It's strange to see someone of this magnitude brought down by essentially a 
twerp, a low life. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Brought down by himself. The mechanism is not significant. Like Nixon 
and all these figures, it's a little event, I mean, a two-bit break-in at 
Watergate. The event is accidental. The essential problem is much more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There do seem to be a lot of similarities. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: And with a lot of other historical figures. They stumble over the 
little things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You get caught in something else, something you hadn't covered for. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yeah, that's why tax fraud is so prevalent. It's complicated and 
people don't pay much attention to it. They're doing a lot of big crimes, and 
then the little crime of cheating on their taxes is the one they do time for. I 
can't say I was surprised by that. I don't think the whole story is over. The 
whole affair is moved from my world to other peoples' worlds. The real story is 
now in Florida in those things, the Spira case out here. They don't involve me. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There was a lot of concern over the past winter about smaller-market teams 
being able to survive. Is that still a concern among the owners? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Yeah, it's a concern. I don't know the answer to that. Because look 
what's going on in baseball. The White Sox have a very low payroll and are 
doing terrific. Pittsburgh may win the pennant and they've got a bunch of guys 
they're not paying any particular money because nobody thought they were any 
good and they turned out to be pretty good. The guys who went out and spent a 
huge amount of money are not doing so great: Kansas City, California, the poor 
Braves spent all that money for (Nick) Esasky. It's hard to find a major 
free-agent signing last year, other than (Tony) Pena, that you would really say 
has been a huge success for the signing team. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question I have is, if I'm running a team, what lesson do I draw? I 
mean, am I going to be less aggressive? I don't know the answer to that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What baseball appears to have lost is the inner-city participation. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: You're right. In two respects. One is kids playing and two is people 
going. I go to the ballpark and I look and I see an almost totally white 
audience. And I say to myself in Detroit or Boston, 'Why is that?' And I talk 
to (National League president) Bill White and he says it's economics. But my 
research says it's not economics. Because the black man is not complaining 
about price. The resistance is much more fundamental. They're not comfortable 
associating with 'a white man's game.' I'm telling you that's a big challenge 
for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How is the minority hiring coming? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: I think it's a big issue in baseball. There's no black general 
manager. Take aside financial, business operations, marketing -- because 
they're a lot of minorities out there; we would be statistically sound -- but 
if you put baseball people out there you'll find a woman or two, a black or 
two. Not many. Again, we're making progress. But we've got a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What can baseball do? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: You lobby and cajol. I had an owner in here yesterday and he's talking 
about hiring someone. And I said, 'It would be great if you hired a black. Look 
hard at minorities.' And he said he would. What you do is what you do in every 
business. You have to work at it. We have consulting firms that travel around 
and push it. Most of all we have moral suasion. The issue has to be pushed and 
pushed and pushed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a fear of the Yankees moving to New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: I don't know. I think the city will come to its senses. I hope it 
will. There's no question there's a problem up there. I drive up there the way 
you do. Sometimes you get stuck there along that drive, around 155th Street, 
there will be policemen there. And you can just spend a half an hour getting 
from the exit on the Deegan to the ballpark. That should be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
I went up there last Fourth of July and I was solicited by all sorts of ladies 
and men. It's not a nice thing to happen to you on the Fourth of July on your 
way to the ballpark at 11 in the morning. I think there are problems. The 
parking is a problem. But I hope the Yankees and the city will do what's 
necessary to fix them. There are serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you have, in the players' terms, a good year? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent: Oh, I don't think in those terms. Look, I think the best I can do is 
try the best that I can. I've made a lot of mistakes, but I've always felt that 
if I tried and did the best that I could ... I don't have any regrets about the 
amount of effort or energy application. I do the best I can and let someone 
else evaluate.

PETERSON AN UNLIKELY CHOICE AS U.S. COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's difficult to believe that the U.S. Hockey committee could not come up with 
a better choice than Dave Peterson as 1992 Olympic coach. 
</P>
<P>
More than difficult, it's astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides coaching his team out of the medal running in 1988 at Calgary, Alberta, 
with the likes of Craig Janney, Brian Leetch and Scott Young, Peterson was a 
public relations nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson -- out of his element after coaching Minnesota high schools -- going 
bonkers after a Swiss reporter asked him why he had the only team at the 
Olympics without a system would have been hilarious if it wasn't so pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
One excuse this time for not hiring Herb Brooks, the ultimate powerbroker after 
his 1980 gold-medal miracle, is that he demanded the job for both the 1992 and 
1994 Games. 
</P>
<P>
But what about Yale's Tim Taylor? He coached the United States at the World 
Championships in April. 
</P>
<P>
And what about bright, rising star Jeff Sauer of NCAA champion Wisconsin? He 
coached the United States at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
And is hiring a top-notch coach long term the way the Canadians did with Dave 
King such a bad idea? 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, Sauer, Brooks, Bob Johnson, Larry Pleau, Jay Leach, Mike Milbury, Ted 
Sator, Bill Cleary, John Cunniff, Shawn Walsh. ... That's only a start of a 
list of American coaches who can do the job better than Peterson. And if they 
aren't available now because of National Hockey League or college commitments, 
they might be in six months. What's the rush to pick a guy who led a talented 
team to seventh place and lost his composure in the process? 
</P>
<P>
"It's their decision -- I've got no comment," Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Young said. "I really thought they were grooming Tim Taylor 
or Jeff Sauer. I thought (Peterson) did a very good job leading up to the 
Olympics. He was a father-figure and he was a pretty calm guy. But during the 
Olympics, I think he felt the pressure. He got on the wrong side of the media, 
right off the bat. He got badgered and wouldn't answer questions. I remember a 
guy asking who'd be in goal the next game and he said something like, 'The man 
on the moon.' 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a lot easier on him if he accepted that the whole world was 
watching. He didn't. He acted a lot different during the Olympics. You could 
tell he was under a lot of stress. And he got portrayed as a real jerk." 
</P>
<P>
The amateur hockey hierarchy in this country is a closed society. A few 
stubborn men run this society like amateur tennis was run in the early 1960s. 
Time is passing them by. If American public really cared about hockey, the 
uproar of this selection would have been heard from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is I think he's learned a lot (Peterson supposedly will take 
some media-relations classes)," Young said. "This is a rare second opportunity 
for him. I think he knows his stuff. We were in excellent condition. We could 
have concentrated a little more on defense. But the guys liked him during the 
year. He was fair." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the PR disaster is only part of it. The supposed "Run and Gun Yanks" 
ended up as a disorganized fire-drill in Calgary. Defense can be coached. And 
even if Peterson is a good man, this guy simply lost his composure too badly 
the first time to be brought back. 
</P>
<P>
With Grant Fuhr's admission of a substance abuse and his NHL hearing scheduled 
in Toronto Sept. 26, it's time -- once again -- to call for the NHL and the 
players association to get their act together and form a comprehensive drug 
plan for treatment and uniform discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Edmonton Oilers goalie told the Edmonton Journal he had a 
seven-year problem, he claims he has been clean for a year after spending two 
weeks at a Florida drug center. But Fuhr's former wife, Corrine, who forced the 
issue to go public, is still worried about him and confirmed the drug is 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
What does NHL President John Ziegler do about this? Fuhr wasn't arrested with 
cocaine in his underwear like Bob Probert was. Is it fair to leave these young 
guys' lives in the hands of one man? No. It's not fair to Ziegler either. The 
NHL's rule, "Do drugs and you'll get suspended," is not nearly an elaborate 
enough response. And Chicago Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz Friday told The 
National he suspects 12 unnamed NHL players use drugs. How responsible a 
statement is that from the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors? Where's the 
proof? 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Daryl Reaugh, Fuhr's former backup in Edmonton who now is with the 
Hartford Whalers, says he never saw Fuhr using cocaine: "I had no idea and I 
was around him every day for a while. The years he's talking about he was the 
best goalie in hockey. It's shocking to think he'd be that good while doing 
that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know Grant, you'd realize he just doesn't take some things other people 
would think were serious as serious. I remember, like, he had video tapes he 
just never returned. He was so happy-go-lucky it was scary. There's been rumors 
and stuff like that. But I was around there a long time and never actually saw 
any of it." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy figuring New Jersey Devil General Manager Lou Lamoriello. Last 
summer, he traded away his grit -- Pat Verbeek -- to acquire offensive dancers 
like Sylvain Turgeon and Walt Poddubny. A year later, he traded Turgeon just to 
get a grinder (Claude Lemieux) back from the Montreal Canadiens. "Jersey went 
from one extreme to the other," Verbeek said. "We had a lot of muckers. Then, I 
felt, they went all offense last year. Now, they're going back to the other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Devils Coach John Cunniff, the former Whalers assistant, who 
went to bat to get Turgeon for Verbeek last summer -- a move the Devils soon 
regretted. A Canadian hockey writer went so far as to describe it as the 
"Kennel Club trade," because Turgeon (who could be out six weeks after a hernia 
operation) and Lemeiux have spent so much time in coaches' doghouses in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be good for Sly," said Whalers defenseman Sylvain 
Cote. "He's playing before his public in Montreal. He knows he's going to have 
to play hard every night or the fans will be all over him."

Canadiens General Manager Serge Savard was roasted by the Montreal media for 
not making any moves last year. One columnist, in fact, painted him as such a 
bland, indecisive type that he didn't even put raisins or sugar on his bran 
cereal. The strange thing is Savard broke loose this summer with some whopping 
moves and looks like he made the team worse. Certainly, Craig Ludwig to the New 
York Islanders for Gerald Diduck makes the Whalers and the rest of the Adams 
Division happy. Ludwig blocks shots like a goaltender and many players were too 
afraid to park in front of the net with Ludwig hacking away. Ludwig did want 
out of Montreal but Savard should have gotten a better deal.

Optical Radiation Corp.: The company said net income for fiscal 1990 totaled 
$7.3 million, up 64% from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 19% to $130.1 million. Profit was reduced by a $6.7-million charge 
related to an adverse decision in a patent litigation case. The Azusa-based 
company said the earnings rise reflected significant contributions from its 
consumer optical group and improved performance from its ophthalmic surgical 
products group.

Certron Corp.: The Anaheim-based manufacturer of audio recording tapes and 
distributor of video cassettes and floppy disks posted a third-quarter loss of 
$544,000, contrasted with net earnings of $45,000 for the year earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the quarter ended July 31 declined 49%, to $4 million from $7.9 
million. For the nine month period, the company lost $1.3 million, contrasted 
with net earnings of $233,000 a year ago. Sales fell 41%, to $13.8 million from 
$23.4 million. Certron said the general softening of the economy has caused a 
decrease in video cassette sales during the current year, and contract 
manufacturing sales were also off from third quarter of last year.

<P>
Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth producer of printers and other equipment for 
the military, reported earnings of $47,522, despite a 21% decline in revenues 
to $6.5 million in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 29.

<P>
A year earlier, the company lost $278,906 on $8.28 million in revenues.

For the nine months that ended in July, Datametrics reported net income of

The company attributed the profit turnaround to reduced operating costs, better 
inventory controls and management of working capital, and to lower interest 
expenses due to the reduction of debt.

Software Toolworks Inc., a rapidly growing maker of video games and 
personal-computer software, moved its headquarters from Chatsworth to Novato. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its corporate staff, the company also moved its 
research-and-development operations, and overall about 75 employees were 
transferred, Chairman Les Crane said. But the company left its duplicating, 
printing and packaging operations in Chatsworth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Software Toolworks chose Novato, situated north of San Francisco in Marin 
County, because "the pool of available manpower is rich and deep and we felt 
the environment was perhaps more conducive to creative programming," Crane 
said.

JACK SMITH: OF WOMEN AND ONE-LINERS -- A TREACHEROUS MIXTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard for a man, especially one of my generation, to say anything about 
women, however generous of intent, without being accused of sexism. 
</P>
<P>
For my recent selection of excerpts from "An Uncommon Scold," a collection of 
witticisms by women, which I prefaced by saying that I considered women wittier 
than men and preferred their conversation, I am scolded by Chris Marchese, 19, 
of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
She says she was "particularly irritated" by my implication that women's minds 
"are on one thing only -- their existence in relationship to men. I have no 
doubt that, if you had been quoting 'witty' remarks made by males, you would 
have included such topics as sports, politics, art, religion, etc. Females, 
however, seem to be confined to the trivial realms of gossip, housekeeping, 
'love,' marriage and their husbands' fidelity. . . . None of these topics are 
of supreme relevance to my life. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps women are funnier when they are lashing out at subjects related to men 
and other oppressive aspects of their lives. I thumbed back through the book, 
which was compiled by Abby Adams, a New York writer, to see what they had to 
say on other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
On America: "In the United States there is more space where nobody is than 
where anybody is. That is what makes America what it is." -- Gertrude Stein. 
"Europeans used to say Americans were puritanical. Then they discovered that we 
were not puritans. So now they say we are obsessed with sex." -- Mary McCarthy. 
(Hard to get away from sex.) 
</P>
<P>
Art: "If Michelangelo painted in Caesars Palace, would that make it any less 
art?" -- Cher. "Why should I paint dead fish, onions and beer glasses? Girls 
are so much prettier." -- Marie Lurencin. 
</P>
<P>
Beauty? No, that's suspect. Children? Too close to home. Conception? No, no. 
Culture? All right. "One old lady who wants her head lifted wouldn't be so bad, 
but you multiply her 250,000 times and what you get is a book club." -- 
Flannery O'Connor. "Culture is an instrument wielded by professors to 
manufacture professors, who when their turn comes, will manufacture 
professors." -- Simone Weil. 
</P>
<P>
Dependence? Nope. Divorce? No way. What about Education? "A good education is 
usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head." -- Agnes 
De Mille. "Lack of education is an extraordinary handicap when one is being 
offensive." -- Josephine Tey. 
</P>
<P>
The Family? No. Fashion? No. Let's try History. "Real solemn history, I cannot 
be interested in. . . . The quarrels of Popes and kings, with wars or 
pestilence in every page, the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women 
at all." -- Jane Austen. 
</P>
<P>
Housework? Out-of-bounds. Husbands? Same. Infatuation? No. Infidelity? Heavens 
no. Injustice? "When one has been threatened with a great injustice, one 
accepts a smaller as a favour." -- Jane Carlyle. 
</P>
<P>
Literature: "Some say life is the thing, but I prefer reading." -- Ruth 
Rendell. "The one thing I regret is that I will never have time to read all the 
books I want to read." -- Francoise Sagan. "I am reading Henry James . . . and 
feel myself as one entombed in a block of smooth amber." -- Virginia Woolf. 
"Henry James chews more than he bites off." -- Mrs. Henry Adams. (OK. Those 
last two are witty.) 
</P>
<P>
Love? Out of-bounds. Marriage? Taboo. Men? Not this trip. Men and Women? Same 
objection. What about Music? "Nobody really sings in an opera. They just make 
loud noises." -- Amelita Galli-Curci. "I can hold a note as long as the Chase 
National Bank." -- Ethel Merman. 
</P>
<P>
The Penis? Perish the thought! Philosophy? Let's try it: "I believe that people 
would be alive today if there were a death penalty." -- Nancy Reagan. "You can 
never be too rich or too thin." -- The Duchess of Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
Now, politics: "There's never been a good government." -- Emma Goldman. "It is 
far easier to act under conditions of tyranny than to think." -- Hannah Arendt. 
"Nonviolence is a flop. The only bigger flop is violence." -- Joan Baez. 
"Congress -- these, for the most part, illiterate hacks whose fancy vests are 
spotted with gravy and whose speeches, hypocritical, unctuous, and slovenly, 
are spotted along with the gravy of political patronage." -- Mary McCarthy. 
"One of the things that politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned 
or reasonable sex." -- Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
And Religion: "I read the book of Job last night -- I don't think God comes 
well out of it." -- Virginia Woolf. "The Bible and the church have been the 
greatest stumbling blocks in the way of women's emancipation." -- Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton. "I always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible 
to digest. The only one I can ever remember is that if all the people who go to 
sleep in church were laid end to end they would be a lot more comfortable." -- 
Mrs. Robert A. Taft. 
</P>
<P>
But I have no doubt that in culling these quotations I have somehow exposed yet 
a deeper sexism.

THE WORLD OF RENE DUBOS EDITED BY GERARD PIEL AND OSBORN SEGERBERG JR. HENRY 
HOLT &amp; CO.$29.95, 418 PAGES

A youthful R. Buckminster Fuller, according to a story widely repeated by 
scientists, once eagerly asked Einstein how he kept track of all his ideas. Did 
he write them on the backs of envelopes? Did he keep a notebook in his pocket? 
A tape recorder? 
</P>
<P>
"Young man," the great physicist patiently replied, "I have had only two 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
As the present book shows, the late microbiologist Rene Dubos, who is now 
generally acknowledged to be one of the 20th Century's most distinguished 
scientists, likewise had only two ideas. And those ideas may well prove to help 
humankind as much as certain applications of Einstein's thought have threatened 
it. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dubos' ideas is that man can improve nature. "It is not true that 
'Nature knows best,' " Dubos writes. "It often creates ecosystems that are 
inefficient, wasteful and destructive. (It) is to be seen . . . as a garden to 
be cultivated for the development of its own potentialities for the human 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Dubos' other idea is that life must be studied in its natural surroundings, not 
just in a test tube. By studying nature only in an artificial environment, 
Dubos writes, "science is betraying the very spirit of its vocation . . . 
nature exists in ecosystems." 
</P>
<P>
These are surprising statements coming from a man who spent half of his 81 
years standing at a laboratory bench and teasing apart bacteria, especially in 
view of Dubos' extraordinary success in that enterprise. He made the key 
discovery that led, in 1938, to the first commercially produced antibiotic, and 
the tuberculosis vaccine he later developed is still in use today. 
</P>
<P>
The transplanted Frenchman wrote, in masterful English, 22 books and hundreds 
of articles during his long career, many of them for the lay public. His book 
"So Human an Animal," in fact, won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction in 1969. 
The present collection of his writings was judiciously selected by co-editor 
Gerard Piel, the founding publisher of "Scientific American" and a longtime 
friend of Dubos. It combines readings from a wide variety of sources: 
scientific and medical journals, popular science magazines, newspapers, 
journals in architecture and the humanities, and books for specialized as well 
as general audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The collection's modes of discourse are at least as varied. The published 
pieces include a technical report to a medical association and a sermon 
delivered at New York City's cathedral of St. John the Divine. Arrayed between 
those poles are newspaper op-ed pieces, popular essays and feature articles for 
magazines, university lectures, speeches to environmentalists, architects and 
other audiences, personal columns for a scholarly journal, interviews and 
chapters from his books. 
</P>
<P>
In all these pieces Dubos follows the ramifications of his two ideas along a 
striking variety of paths. His subjects include, among many others, the history 
of the tulip, a rebuttal of popular theories accounting for the population 
explosion (or "avalanche," which he prefers for its connotation of 
acceleration), a discussion of the cause of the common cold, a celebration of 
New York City architecture and culture, a 1968 warning against asbestos, an 
inquiry into what constitutes human nature, and a biographical sketch of Louis 
Pasteur. Each piece is charged with Dubos' radically original imagination, and 
each is leavened by his "despairing optimism" (his phrase) about humankind's 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Described in this way, the book sounds like a bewildering smorgasbord. On the 
contrary, it is a superbly balanced and tasty intellectual feast. The man 
within the prose remains consistently welcoming, and his unfolding thought so 
winningly captivates the reader that even science-phobes, if they only give 
Dubos a chance, will be swept happily along. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the book is light reading. Its demanding arrangement 
deliberately reflects Dubos' view that knowledge should be earned the hard way: 
"When I retired . . . I was asked to teach in two universities. I seemed to be 
a big success. But I was a 'big success' in a way I found extremely dangerous. 
The students saw me, at the end of my life, working on very general problems 
and making observations about every discipline, be it social, medical or 
scientific. Immediately they wanted to do the same thing. . . . Yet I'd tell 
them every day, 'I want to stress that for forty years I was the most 
disciplined microbiologist possible, and not until I realized that I'd mastered 
that discipline could I permit myself to look at it from the outside.' . . . 
When you believe that, above all, the most indispensable thing is to view 
problems in terms of their interrelationships rather than in terms of the 
elements they're made up of, it means that you must first be very familiar with 
those elements. If not, you're just jabbering." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the jabbering of today's media marketplace, this timeless collection of 
writing eloquently reminds us that there are still giants on the earth. "The 
World of Rene Dubos" deserves a place in every library.

YOUR BODY: SOME 'ALLERGIC' TO STRESS-REDUCTION CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COUNTERPOINT Age and Tonsil Surgery For years, most doctors have been 
reluctant to remove the tonsils of young children, arguing that it's safer to 
wait until a child is at least 3 years old. But a study published in the 
Archives of Otolaryngology Head an 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You're anxious and it's getting worse by the day. You snarl at other drivers, 
slam doors at home, mutter mean things to co-workers. At last, you take charge 
and enroll in a stress-reduction program. Finally, you can relax. 
</P>
<P>
Or can you? 
</P>
<P>
After just a few sessions of stress-reduction training, you feel more stressed 
than ever. Worse yet, you are nervous because you don't seem to be getting the 
knack of it as quickly as you'd hoped. 
</P>
<P>
What you have now, according to one psychology expert, is relaxation-induced 
anxiety, a paradoxical response some people suffer when they participate in 
formal relaxation training. 
</P>
<P>
"At least one in three persons will not find traditional relaxation techniques 
especially helpful," said Arnold Lazarus, distinguished professor of psychology 
at Rutgers University, who writes about the limitations of relaxation in the 
current issue of the journal Psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, while many people derive benefits from the relaxation response, 
some appear to be 'allergic' to it and for them, it is clearly 
contraindicated," Lazarus wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When clients react unfavorably to formal relaxation programs, Lazarus said, 
they most often say they fear losing control. 
</P>
<P>
Formal relaxation techniques aren't the answer for everyone, agrees a 
Huntington Beach psychologist who directs a biofeedback center. Least likely to 
derive benefits from the formal programs, said Ivy Walker Wittmeyer, are people 
who need to be "in control," those who have had a bad psychological reaction to 
anesthesia, those with a history of illegal drug use and "bad trips" and those 
who have been sedated for mental health problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker indicates that formal relaxation programs can work for most people, 
given the proper instruction. "What people often don't understand is, they can 
gain control by allowing themselves to lose control," Wittmeyer said. She talks 
to patients at length to prove that "letting go" during biofeedback sessions 
can ultimately help them gain control over stress and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
For those who still can't relax in formal relaxation programs, Lazarus suggests 
finding a therapist who can tailor a program to their personality and needs. He 
has developed a questionnaire for therapists to predict what forms of 
relaxation work with which clients. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to less traditional relaxation approaches can be the answer for others, 
Lazarus said in an interview. A client who is very active might do better 
running laps than learning biofeedback, for instance, he said. "Some people 
find mini-relaxation is the answer -- simply closing their eyes several times a 
day for two or three minutes," Lazarus said. He tells other clients to sit in a 
bathtub with warm water for half an hour and read a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lazarus' personal stress-reduction method? "I watch TV a heck of a lot," 
he said, "and I play tennis."

New Scale Talks You Down 
</P>
<P>
Need a booster shot of motivation to lose those extra pounds? Maybe you need a 
conscience like the Technasonics' new Weight Talker II, a $99 talking scale 
with a volume control. 
</P>
<P>
A man's voice tells you your weight, plus the amount gained or lost since the 
last weigh-in, according to Kenneth Burnett, Technasonics' president. Even if 
you've slipped, it tells you "Goodby" or "Have a nice day," whichever sign-off 
you select. As many as five family members can store data in the Weight Talker 
II, sold through Sears catalogue and other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Is it worth the price? Yes, with some caveats, according to Jody Lander 
Spector, program coordinator of a weight loss program at St. Vincent Medical 
Center, Los Angeles. "It does keep track for you. You don't have to remember 
what you used to weigh. He just told you." 
</P>
<P>
But Spector cautions people not to become obsessive about weigh-ins, whatever 
scale they use. Weigh in weekly on the same day and at the same time, she 
recommends. "And keep a written record. It helps."

(900) NEW KIDS: A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed lawsuits filed by the 
pop group New Kids on the Block against USA Today and a tabloid magazine, 
ruling that the band's image can be used by the publications to promote 
900-line telephone polls. In dismissing the lawsuits on Monday, U.S. District 
Judge William Rea found that, as news-gathering organizations, USA Today and 
the Star magazine are permitted to use the group's trademarks to conduct polls 
and surveys. The publications are protected under the First Amendment from the 
group's claims of trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair 
competition. BETH KLEID

MACHOVER'S MAGIC IN CYBERARTS FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tod Machover is one of the reigning masters of computer-aided music making, an 
institutional blueblood from the MIT Media Laboratory via IRCAM in Paris and 
Juilliard. Sunday afternoon he closed out the CyberArts International 
conference at the Biltmore Hotel with a sonically voluptuous, technologically 
dazzling program of his recent works. 
</P>
<P>
The two ensemble pieces involved what Machover calls "hyperinstruments" -- 
amplified, computer-enhanced extensions of normal instruments, with effects 
somewhat like Morton Subotnick's familiar "ghost" electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"Bug-Mudra" is a fast ride in a fun machine, based on two guitars and a modest 
percussion battery. Basically a very sophisticated, techno-pop moto perpetuo, 
it storms along with irresistible energy and elan. 
</P>
<P>
Machover himself conducted, looking something like Woody Allen as a crazed 
musician, wearing a dataglove -- tied into the hyperinstrument system, of 
course -- on his left hand, with its cable sneaking out under his coat like a 
tail. David Starobin and Oren Fader were the virtuosic, tireless guitarists, 
and Amy Knowles plied the percussion. 
</P>
<P>
The most technically simple -- everything is relative -- and shortest piece, 
the taped "Flora," proved the most musically beguiling, with its moody 
transformations of soprano Karol Bennett's voice. Accompanying it was a 
luminous, similarly evolving HDTV video by Yoichiro Kawaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
"Towards the Center" utilized the always effective services of the California 
E.A.R. Unit, conducted by Stephen Mosko, and abetted by the hyperinstrument 
system. Strip away the glossy production, however, and underneath lay a rather 
ordinary neo-romantic essay, conventional in thought and expression.JOHN HENKEN

Where do choreographers go when they lack places in which they can afford to 
perform? Back to their studios, apparently, where they keep inventing and 
honing dances until an opportunity like Dance Pool comes along.

Joan Nicholson, Michelle Berne and Nancy Fassett shared Friday's opening

eloquently of her grandmothers while Stella Matsuda and Sissy Boyd depicted the 
crotchety women she found "hard to love." 
</P>
<P>
A second monologue, "Rented Rooms," set her memoirs of a life lived in 
temporary quarters against a recorded score of overwhelming John Coltrane jazz; 
one struggled to hear the witty commentary. Poised with her notebook at a cafe 
table, she talked while Boyd filled the stage with decorative movement. 
</P>
<P>
Combining dance with text is always tricky; Nicholson succeeded because she is 
a real poet, able to construct economical language that travels well from the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Fassett, using the same device of a single personality represented by two 
performers, fell into the trap of psychologizing and described what she was 
already showing, snapshots of a woman driven by the expectations of others. 
Perhaps useful therapeutically, this process flops onstage. 
</P>
<P>
Berne's wordless duets were dramatic; in the first, a man and woman struggled 
on a table while Jane Ira Bloom blew her soprano sax into the body of a grand 
piano. In the second, a woman-in-white midwifed the emergence of a sea spirit 
from a bundle of rags. Berne has studied Butoh; sustained dramatic imagery is 
her strength. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening's program included familiar works by Heidi Duckler, Donna 
Sternberg and Jill Jacobson-Bennett, as well as a few premieres, all short. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg performed "Who are Your Heroes," a promising solo sandbagged by its 
moralizing text but cheered along by Jaston Nishizaki live on harmonica. 
Jacobson-Bennett, a good dancer, offered diverting phrases of movement to such 
trendy accompaniment as the Gipsy Kings and Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
A promised premiere from Duckler did not materialize; in its place was "Your 
Knees Are Friends," a 1985 spoof of debutantes by Mary Reid. ELIZABETH ZIMMER

 Tedious, interminable, needlessly repetitive Thai film protesting the

elephant keeper, seeking to survive this destruction. Prince Chatri Chalerm 
Yukol brings considerable polish and technical finesse to his film, but the 
urgency of its theme is dissipated by its sheer ponderousness. KEVIN THOMAS

If the Los Angeles Festival's mission was to unite exotic art from the Pacific 
Rim with that in our own back yard, the concert at UCLA's Sunset Canyon 
Amphitheatre Sunday night was a rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
The musical base was rooted in the Andes, but the branches would reach well 
into the North American sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
The setting was outdoors and, except for the urban noises and whiffs of ozone, 
far more appropriate than that of a concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
Allyu Sankayo -- a seven-person group from Bolivia clad in colorful native 
costumes and headgear -- served as an Andean control sample of sorts. The 
members delivered an engaging hour of stomping dance rhythms and haunting 
repetitive tunes, evoking the high altitudes with the ethereal sounds of the 
tarkas (a wooden flute) and Andean panpipes. 
</P>
<P>
They would alternate on various winds, guitars, charangos and drums, topped off 
by the piercing voice of Miriam Mita. 
</P>
<P>
With Huayucaltia, we entered a more cosmopolitan world, one that probably can 
be traced to the influence of the phonograph. This Los Angeles-based outfit is 
a vital, confident, sophisticated hybrid, one that uses the Andes as a 
jumping-off point for free-thinking excursions and blends. 
</P>
<P>
The members isolate and segue irresistible rhythms from all over Latin America; 
they are not afraid to use the synthesizer as an expressive additive color. The 
lead guitarist is an elegantly polished virtuoso named Ciro Hurtado, who can 
evoke flourishes of flamenco or the jazzy staccato runs of Al DiMeola with 
consummate ease. RICHARD S. GINELL

'FAMILY MAN': NOTHING TO OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can just hear the original pitch made to CBS programming executives 
concerning tonight's new comedy about a widower living with his kids and 
father-in-law: 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a new idea for an old show." 
</P>
<P>
The new idea is "The Family Man," premiering at 8:30 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8, 
hereafter to appear Saturdays at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The old show is "My Three Sons." 
</P>
<P>
All right, so nitpick. Fire Chief Jack Taylor (Gregory Harrison) has a daughter 
in addition to three sons. And the long-running Fred MacMurray series 
(1960-1972 on ABC and CBS) had at least some charm, while the premiere of "The 
Family Man" has none. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it funny, with the jokes crashing faster than Jack slides down his fire 
pole. What we do get is Jack playing mommy, and grandpa Joe (Al Molinaro) 
playing grandmommy to these four kids, building to the inevitable blubbery 
climax when the writers -- apparently having given up trying to make anyone 
laugh -- go for tears. The sequence involves one of the kids having trouble 
accepting the mother's death, and it's about as shamelessly maudlin as TV gets. 
</P>
<P>
That's another difference between the two series. "My Three Sons" may have been 
a little thick, but it was never manipulative. HOWARD ROSENBERG

IRAQ RESTORING IRAN TIES IN BID TO EASE ISOLATION;

DIPLOMACY: BAGHDAD HOPES TEHRAN WILL HELP BREAK THE EMBARGO. HUSSEIN OFFERS 
FREE OIL TO 3RD WORLD.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government moved Monday to fully mend fences with Iran, its enemy of 
the 1980s, by announcing that it will restore diplomatic relations with Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers in Baghdad interpreted the move as one more effort to break 
out of the international isolation that has developed since Iraq invaded 
neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second gesture President Saddam Hussein has made to Iran in less 
than a month. In mid-August, he announced the withdrawal of Iraqi troops that 
had occupied a section of Iran after the 8-year Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988 and 
renounced his claim to disputed territory at the head of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Hussein offered to supply oil free of charge to Third World 
countries suffering from higher prices brought on by the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech read as usual by a network announcer, Hussein said: "We 
announce today that we are still your brother and share with you the same 
destiny. Therefore, we declare now that we are prepared to supply you with 
Iraqi oil free of charge." 
</P>
<P>
He said that anyone who wants the oil, "under the assumption" that such a gift 
is not forbidden by U.N. sanctions, should simply apply for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prompted by a principled and moral commitment to ease some of your 
burden and to demonstrate solidarity with you," Hussein said. "Such a decision 
is not related to, and shall not be affected by, any of your decisions and 
attitudes toward the current crisis." 
</P>
<P>
With oil revenues cut off, along with imports of food, medicine, spare parts 
and machinery, the blockade is taking a toll on Iraq, but analysts say the 
country has not yet begun to buckle under the strain. Iran and Iraq share a 
long border, and if Iran decided to ignore the sanctions, the blockade could 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement on the restoration of ties came at the end of a two-day visit 
to Tehran by Iraq's Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. He was shown on television 
here speaking cheerfully with Iranian officials. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement seemed to suggest that Iraq wants more than just formal 
diplomatic ties. Western diplomats noted that the quest for "natural" relations 
implies trade links as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq War ended two years ago in a cease-fire brokered by the United 
Nations, and when Iraq formally sued for peace last month, it was seen as an 
effort to free troops for use against the multinational force being assembled 
on the Arabian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since the war, neither Iran nor Iraq had shown so much as a 
glimmer of trust until last spring, when Hussein raised the possibility of a 
summit peace conference. 
</P>
<P>
The key point of dispute was the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that forms the two 
nations' southern border. Control of the waterway, the gulf outlet of the Iraqi 
port of Basra, was a prime strategic target for Baghdad's troops when they 
poured into Iran in September, 1980. Five years earlier, the late Shah Mohammed 
Reza Pahlavi, then the power in the gulf, had forced upon Iraq an agreement to 
share the Shatt al Arab straight down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the invasion of Kuwait, faced with the first elements of what 
has become a massive Western military buildup in the gulf region, Hussein 
called for an exchange of prisoners of war, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from 
Iranian territory and a 50-50 division of the Shatt al Arab. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you wanted . . . has been realized," he said in a letter to Iran's 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hussein's propaganda organs announced that peace on the Iranian border 
would permit the military to move 30 divisions, more than 300,000 men, to the 
southern front "for the great duel" over Kuwait, intelligence reports indicate 
that fewer than five of the divisions have shown any sign of moving. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the blockade proving effective, Hussein is believed to be looking to 
Iran as a way of circumventing the blockade and bringing in supplies. Large 
shipments of food would be sighted easily in sparsely populated Jordan, but 
Iran has a population of more than 50 million, and increased supplies could be 
brought into Iranian ports without seeming unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before Aziz arrived in Baghdad, the English-language Tehran Times 
openly suggested that "humanitarian shipments" might be passed through to Iraq. 
Ever since U.N. trade sanctions were imposed last month, Hussein has been 
probing for potential soft spots with a series of public relations gestures. 
</P>
<P>
To Arab nationalists, he has portrayed his cause as a battle against Westerners 
out to subjugate the Arab world. To Muslims, he has depicted himself as a 
defender of holy shrines in Saudi Arabia. Addressing his former arms supplier, 
the Soviet Union, he has called for a return to the days when Moscow and 
Washington battled by proxy in Third World conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
These appeals have failed to have any effect on the noose being tightened 
around Iraq, and now Hussein is waving a seductive card at the Third World, 
particularly at debtor countries hard hit by rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Striking an us-against-them note, Hussein accused the Western powers of 
forgetting the poor countries' troubles in their frenzy to turn back Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It should not come as a surprise to you, brothers, when the big and developed 
countries do not show much concern for your issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies, he said, "did not ask, nor did they provide 
an answer to the harm they would bring to the Third World countries. While oil 
monopolies are still drawing filthy profits from this crisis, they let Third 
World countries muddle into their crises." 
</P>
<P>
Whether anyone takes Hussein up on the offer may be beside the point, analysts 
believe. They say he is trying to win sympathy in the underdeveloped countries 
on the basis of their needs and his apparent generosity. 
</P>
<P>
His offer will hit several poor Asian countries at a time of frustration with 
the West. Asians perceive that Western governments are ignoring the plight of 
tens of thousands of Indian, Pakistani and Filipino workers trapped in Kuwait 
and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Asian diplomats in Baghdad complain that their citizens are de facto hostages 
because they lack the means to get out, while the West is obsessed with the 
Western hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"No one cares about brown-skinned refugees," Achmed Sakkam, the Philippine 
ambassador, complained. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian workers are helpless because the only exit open to them is through 
Jordan, where hundreds of thousands of refugees already are waiting for 
transportation home. Jordan has slowed the flow of refugees from Iraq in order 
to relieve the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Iran, on the other hand, has offered to open its border with Iraq to refugees, 
but Iraq has made no move to let refugees out on that side.

BAKER ASKS NATO NATIONS TO BOLSTER U.S. FORCES IN GULF;

MIDEAST CRISIS: THE REQUEST DRAWS A 'FAVORABLE RESPONSE.' SECRETARY WILL VISIT

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III called on NATO members Monday to send 
ground-based military units to join the U.S. troops deployed against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Baker coupled his appeal to the United States' closest allies with an 
announcement that he will visit Damascus on Friday to coordinate regional 
policy with Syria, a nation the United States has long accused of supporting 
terrorism, possibly including the December, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gave Baker no 
immediate answer, but Manfred Woerner, the alliance's secretary general, said 
the request for at least token contingents of ground troops received a 
"favorable reception." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Baker announced that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates 
and the exiled government of Kuwait have agreed to contribute the entire 
$6-billion cost of the U.S. operation for the rest of this year and to put up 
another $6 billion to ease the impact on front-line nations like Egypt and 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers less than 24 hours after the 
Helsinki meeting of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
Baker sought to expand West European participation in the American-led drive to 
force Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait and return the deposed Kuwaiti emir 
to his throne. 
</P>
<P>
He said several NATO members agreed to provide aircraft and ships to transport 
Egyptian combat troops to Saudi Arabia, to help evacuate foreigners from Iraq 
and Kuwait and to support U.S. and other forces in the Persian Gulf. Egypt has 
offered to send a substantial number of troops but lacks the transport capacity 
to get them there. 
</P>
<P>
Although NATO will not change its policy of keeping its formal alliance 
structure aloof from conflicts that do not involve an attack on the territory 
of a member nation, Woerner said that most of NATO's 16 members pledged to 
provide either military or financial assistance as individual nations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling that the allies can and should do more," Woerner said. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, West Germany offered to provide transport aircraft and 
ships, the Netherlands agreed to send defensive equipment for chemical and 
biological warfare, Belgium said it would send aircraft and 20,000 tons of 
wheat to Egypt, Greece volunteered three sea lift ships and Denmark offered two 
large "garage ships" to move troops and heavy equipment, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he urged all other members of the alliance to send ground-based forces 
to the region, "even if they were only symbolic" in number. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to suggestions that the United States, with more than 100,000 
military personnel in the area, is providing too large a share of the combat 
troops that would be at the front if hostilities break out, Baker said Britain 
and France have already sent small contingents of ground forces. He said Turkey 
also has combat troops in the area, but they are all in garrisons and the 
government of President Turgut Ozal has declined to join the international 
force established to resist Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
If all the NATO nations agreed to send ground troops to the region, their 
presence would constitute a tripwire that could bring most of the 
industrialized world's strongest nations into the war at once if hostilities 
break out. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the NATO foreign ministers joined Gorbachev in flatly opposing 
the use of military force even if the U.N.-sanctioned trade embargo fails to 
force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not speculate about what could or would happen should peaceful efforts 
fail," Woerner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the allied leaders agreed to redouble their efforts to keep the trade 
embargo "watertight" in order to guarantee that economic measures will work. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he told his NATO colleagues that the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait is 
"a political test of how the post-Cold War order will work." 
</P>
<P>
"The manner in which we, a coalition of democracies, respond will be a measure 
of how well the institutions of Western security, NATO and the WEU (Western 
European Union) can adapt to today's dangers and tomorrow's threats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker acknowledged that his trip to Damascus this week is intended to solidify 
anti-Iraq sentiment in a country that shares very few of the values that 
motivate NATO and the West. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad, who leads a wing of the Baath Arab Socialist 
Party that is a rival to the one controlled by Hussein, was a sworn enemy of 
Iraq long before Baghdad's forces overran Kuwait. Assad has been seeking allies 
for his stand against Hussein for years. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Baker said, "I don't think anything highlights the isolation of 
Saddam Hussein in the Arab community more than Syrian participation in the 
multilateral force." 
</P>
<P>
In its latest annual report on terrorism, the State Department said that "both 
Syria and Syrian-occupied areas of Lebanon . . . remain sanctuaries for a wide 
variety of international groups that have engaged in terrorism, including the 
PFLP-GC (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command)." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. government has repeatedly raised with the Syrian 
government accusations that the PFLP-GC, possibly with Syrian help, planted the 
bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when Baker was asked if he was concerned that his visit to 
Damascus would signal a U.S. readiness to ally itself with any country, even an 
unsavory one, to oppose Iraq, he replied, "Not in the least." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the United States recently opened dialogues with Vietnam and 
Cambodia, two other nations with which Washington has strong differences. 
However, Baker said he would not consider a visit to Iran, another traditional 
enemy of Iraq. Baker said he believes Iran will continue to abide by the trade 
embargo against Iraq despite Monday's move toward resumption of diplomatic 
relations between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Baker's first visit to Syria. Former Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz stopped in Damascus several times in the course of his unsuccessful 
effort to restart the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's trip will be the first into the Middle East by a U.S. secretary of 
state that does not include a stop in Israel. Baker said he has no plan to go 
to Israel because he met last week in Washington with Israeli Foreign Minister 
David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
In his NATO news conference, Baker claimed a remarkable success in Bush 
Administration efforts to offset the cost of resisting Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Citing information he said he received by telephone Monday from U.S. 
ambassadors in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Baker said those two 
countries, plus the ousted government of Kuwait, have agreed to provide $12 
billion over the rest of this year. The money will be divided nearly evenly 
between the cost of the U.S. deployment to the gulf and economic assistance to 
countries like Egypt and Turkey that were hard hit by the effects of the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Baker said Kuwait had agreed to a $5-billion contribution. He did 
not cite individual figures for Saudi Arabia and the Emirates but said that 
together they total $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 billion earmarked for the U.S. military is enough to cover all the 
"incremental" costs identified by the Pentagon for the rest of this year. This 
means that it will cost the U.S. taxpayer no more to deploy ground, naval and 
air forces in the gulf region than it would to keep them at their usual bases. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said in a brief news conference at 
NATO that the 12-nation European Community had adopted a goal of $9 billion in 
contributions to nations that have suffered economically as a result of the 
boycott. Italy now holds the rotating presidency of the organization. De 
Michelis said the community will not change its earlier decision not to help 
fund the U.S. military operation. But he indicated that the European Community 
has decided to make a much larger contribution to affected countries than had 
been announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he told the NATO meeting that money was important "but all the money 
in the world cannot create the airlift and sea lift capabilities required today 
to move heavy forces into place and return refugees home." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the military buildup of the Reagan Administration, the United States 
has failed to modernize its fleet of aircraft and ships required to transport 
troops, tanks and other military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the operation needs still more planes and ships beyond those 
promised Monday. He asked NATO members to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reactivate the alliance's senior civil emergency planning committee to 
coordinate sea lift and airlift contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Redeploy naval forces from the western Mediterranean to the eastern sector 
in order protect the flanks of the Middle East operation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expand airborne warning and control flights from bases in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide economic aid to formerly Communist nations in East Europe that are 
being hard hit by interruption of barter deals for Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Improve compliance with the sanctions against Iraq.

The end of the line for Liberian President Samuel K. Doe was as ignominious as 
most of his 10-year reign: reportedly killed after being shot and captured by a 
rebel force as he arrived to confer with the Ghanaian commander of a six-nation 
"peacekeeping" force in his capital of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
A bare five months ago, Doe managed to mark his 10th anniversary as head of one 
of Africa's oldest independent countries. That was April 12, when he provoked 
snickers at a thinly attended celebratory banquet by remarking: "We recall the 
events of the past 10 years with considerable pride." 
</P>
<P>
Doe, who was 38, has left behind him an economy in tatters, the complete 
dissolution of civil order amid vicious tribal warfare, and the 
near-evaporation of his country's hopes, modest as they were, for democratic 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to his reported demise began with an insurgent force about 
200 strong that crossed the border from Ivory Coast last Christmas Eve. But by 
the time of his capture Sunday, there were four forces under arms in Monrovia: 
the remnant of Doe's own army, thought to number in the hundreds; two separate 
rebel groups of several thousand men each, and the so-called ECOMOG, a force of 
between 2,500 and 3,000 men from six West African countries, sent in by 
regional leaders to try to establish and monitor a cease-fire. Each controls 
some portion of Monrovia or its port. 
</P>
<P>
Doe's reported death at the hands of the troops of Prince Johnson, one of the 
two rebel leaders, evidently further muddies the waters of Liberian leadership. 
No fewer than four individuals now claim to be president of Liberia, where 
nothing resembling formal government has functioned for much of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Monrovia say that after capturing Doe and taking him to his 
headquarters, Johnson declared himself president. He said he would run the 
country until elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
To make that stick, he will have to continue to battle Charles Taylor, the 
onetime Doe lieutenant who led the original insurgent force from which 
Johnson's band splintered in February. Taylor named himself president earlier 
this summer when he gained the outskirts of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the commander of Doe's mansion guard, David Nimley, was named by the 
guard itself as interim president. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders of six West African states sponsoring the "peacekeeping" 
force currently keeping a tenuous grip on the Monrovia port have named their 
own candidate for provisional president. He is Amos Sawyer, a former dean of 
humanities and social sciences at the University of Liberia who was jailed as a 
dissident by Doe in 1985, escaped the country in 1986 and became an exile 
leader in Washington. Sawyer was named president earlier this month at a West 
African summit meeting in Banjul, Gambia, at which none of the other Liberian 
leaders had a representative. 
</P>
<P>
It was characteristic of Doe's administration that his reaction to the rebel 
invasion made matters worse. In the first six months of this year, brutal army 
reprisals against civilians living in the path of the rebel advance drove 
thousands of people over to the rebel side. By late May, when the force reached 
the coast a few miles from the capital, it had 4,000 men under arms, almost 
equal to Doe's own desertion-plagued army. 
</P>
<P>
Because the army massacres were tribal-based, with the Gio and Mano peoples the 
main targets, retaliatory tribal bloodshed by the rebels was inevitable. They 
made members of Doe's tribe, the Krahn, their targets, and thousands of Krahn 
flooded the roads out of Liberia toward Sierra Leone to escape the rebel 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 42, was a government officer until Doe accused him in 1984 of 
embezzling $1 million. He escaped to the United States but was arrested in 
Boston. While awaiting extradition, he managed to escape again, this time by 
bribing prison guards with $30,000, he told associates. Recently, he said that 
the charges against him would be dropped in Liberia once he ousted Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a former Liberian army lieutenant who joined a coup attempt led by 
army officer Thomas Qwiwonkpa in 1985. The attempt failed, but Johnson escaped 
Qwiwonkpa's fate, which was to be captured and dismembered by Doe's forces. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the best intentions, any of these leaders would have enormous 
difficulty rebuilding Liberia from the trough in which it fell during the Doe 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At times it was tempting to mistake Doe for his own caricature as a buffoonish 
incompetent. Early in his regime, the South Koreans beguiled him into letting 
them mint a new Liberian coin to supplement what was then the country's 
official currency, the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Liberia got a supply of thick, heavy and unwieldy $5 coins instantly dubbed 
"Doebucks," and the South Koreans got millions of U.S. greenbacks held until 
then in Liberian banks and maintained as a valuable cache of foreign exchange. 
For his own part, Doe got an honorary doctorate from a South Korean university. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian dollar, until then officially treated as par to the American 
dollar, quickly sank to half the U.S. value. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Doe and his vice president enrolled, to great fanfare, in a 
post-graduate political science course at the Ibrahim Babangida Institute of 
the University of Liberia. At the conclusion of the course, the head of the 
institute announced soberly that the semi-literate president had been the best 
student and the vice president the second-best. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, newscasters on the government broadcast stations routinely 
referred to Doe as "His Excellency, President Doctor Samuel Kanyon Doe." 
</P>
<P>
But the comic-opera trappings masked a ruthless administration. Doe, who came 
to power in a coup, marked the very beginning of his regime with a bloodthirsty 
display: He invited the public to a beach in Monrovia to witness the executions 
of 13 senior officials of the ousted government of William R. Tolbert Jr., who 
was killed during his overthrow. The victims, condemned after casual show 
trials, included six Cabinet ministers, the chief justice, the president of the 
Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodshed was always common among the higher echelons of the Doe government. 
Often it was colored by a Liberian penchant for ritual killings, in which human 
beings take the place of the cows, chickens and goats routinely sacrificed to 
ancestors and spirits in neighboring West African countries. Reports of bodies 
found at roadsides, stripped of various organs and drained of blood, were 
standard fare in Liberia's lurid press, and the perpetrators were often 
identified as members of the political elite. 
</P>
<P>
Short of murder, Doe used a large arsenal of intimidating measures to keep 
political opponents and critical journalists at bay. In 1984, he unleashed his 
army on the campus of the University of Liberia, where students were protesting 
campus conditions and political repression. The wave of looting, flogging and 
rape that followed left the campus community stunned for years. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of the opposition Daily Observer, Kenneth Y. Best, was jailed four 
times; the day after his latest release in 1986, the paper's offices were 
torched. Best rebuilt and resumed publishing, but the offices were burned again 
last March 17 by four men in military uniforms, according to a night watchman. 
</P>
<P>
Two other newspapers, Footprints Today and the Sun Times, were banned, and last 
year Doe shut down the Roman Catholic Church's radio station, the only source 
of nongovernment broadcast reports reaching the countryside. The newspapers and 
radio station were allowed to reopen earlier this year, when Doe was desperate 
for good publicity on human-rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
Strong political opponents were also jailed. They included Gabriel Kpolleh, 
head of the Liberian Unification Party, also recently released after two years 
in prison, and Sawyer, who had been chairman of the National Constitutional 
Drafting Commission and head of the banned Liberia Peoples Party. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, prison conditions for the detainees were brutal. Most were 
incarcerated at the infamous Belle Yalla prison, located in a remote part of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place that in the 20th Century should not exist in the world," said 
Rufus Darpoh, a Sun Times editor jailed there for six months under conditions 
of hard labor. 
</P>
<P>
Doe's 1980 coup was not universally deplored when it ousted Tolbert, who did 
not have the popular support that had helped keep his predecessor, William V. 
S. Tubman, in power for 27 years. Tubman and Tolbert were both descendants of 
the American ex-slaves, a class known popularly in Liberia as "Congos," who had 
ruled the country since they arrived on its shores in a "back-to-Africa" 
movement in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the successive Congo regimes had enriched a corrupt and feckless 
Liberian elite while the rest of the country suffered. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Doe, who kept his existing rank of master sergeant at first but 
later promoted himself to general, was the first descendant of native Africans 
to run Africa's oldest independent state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Doe made a show of keeping his promise to return Liberia to civilian 
rule by legalizing political parties. But he chose to run for president 
himself. Two weeks after the vote, the government announced that Doe had won 
the presidency with 50.9% of the votes cast. An attempt by a coalition of 
opposition parties to challenge the results as transparently rigged was 
undermined when the U.S. State Department, in a report to Congress, accepted 
the outcome and even praised Doe for resisting the typical dictator's impulse 
to claim a majority of more than 90%. 
</P>
<P>
By last year, the government was almost entirely out of business, unable to 
enforce even the few regulations or laws it tried to promulgate. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere here is like a gold-rush town," said one international banker 
in Monrovia, remarking on the flood of business charlatans infesting the 
streets and the inability of the government to police any activity. 
</P>
<P>
Government revenues seemed to exist only for the purpose of getting stolen. 
Much of the $24 million a year charged for Liberian registry of ocean-going 
merchant vessels -- which puts the Liberian flag on thousands of ships and 
nominally gives the tiny country the world's largest fleet -- disappeared, 
provoking a major reshuffling last year in the country's maritime 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
A country blessed with potentially rich agricultural land -- the 
Firestone-Bridgestone concession just outside Monrovia is the world's largest 
rubber plantation -- was unable to feed itself: Crowds jammed Monrovia's 
streets whenever shipments of emergency American rice arrived in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s American aid flowed in at a rate of $100 million a year, 
making Liberia for a time the largest per-capita recipient of foreign aid in 
sub-Saharan Africa. The almost complete absence of rural or urban development 
in the country raises the question of where the money went. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it was poured into projects that are completely useless," former 
Finance Minister David M. Farhat said recently. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Liberia's government budget led the United States in 1987 to 
send a team of 17 "operational experts" to put the country's fiscal house in 
order. The team had the authority to co-sign government checks, veto official 
expenditures and draft departmental budgets. They discovered that there was 
little they could do to keep Doe and his ministers from ordering fleets of 
Mercedes-Benz automobiles and spending wildly and imprudently on anything they 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"They discovered that as fast as they established controls, someone found a way 
to get around them," said one prominent Monrovia businessman. Halfway through 
their two-year contract, the experts packed up and left Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Doe's fiscal misadventures made it even more difficult for Liberia to overcome 
the real pressures on its economic well-being. Among these is the depletion of 
its iron ore mines, which have been managed for decades by foreign 
concessionaires and traditionally supplied about half the country's 
foreign-exchange earnings. The mining companies have lately begun to close the 
increasingly empty mines, in part because a slump in iron ore prices makes it 
pointless to dig farther. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Liberia's gross domestic product fell in virtually every year of the 
Doe regime, dropping from $400 per capita in 1983 to $185 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Such straitened circumstances made it ever harder for Doe to maintain a 
professional army. His unpaid, ill-equipped and untrained soldiers deserted at 
a high rate this year in the face of the rebel advances. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a frightened, illiterate, superstitious bunch expected to put their 
lives on the line for $1.50 a day," remarked one diplomat in Monrovia recently. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise, say some observers, is that Doe was able to survive for so long.

ALL SIDES BACK U.N. PLAN TO END WAR IN CAMBODIA 
</P>

In a historic breakthrough after 11 years of conflict, the four warring parties 
in Cambodia announced Monday that they had reached agreement to share power in 
a national council to run the country until the United Nations can arrange a 
cease-fire and hold free elections. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, the four factions in the 
Cambodian conflict announced their acceptance of a peace plan worked out last 
month by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that will give 
the world body unprecedented powers in the running of the country. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on the creation of a 12-member Supreme National Council, with 
a possible 13th member as chairman, which will take over the executive 
authority in the country and will officially hold Cambodia's seat at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The four factions appeared at a news conference to announce the agreement. They 
included the Vietnamese-backed Premier Hun Sen and representatives of the three 
guerrilla factions: Khieu Samphan, the foreign affairs official of the Khmer 
Rouge; Prince Norodom Ranariddh, representing his father, the exiled Prince 
Norodom Sihanouk; and Son Sann, a former prime minister and leader of the third 
rebel faction. 
</P>
<P>
Officials emphasized that considerable negotiations remain to iron out details 
of the agreement. The four sides did not set a date for the first meeting of 
the national council or say how it would hand over the administration to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not reached peace yet . . . but we have the framework," said Son Sann. 
And Khieu Samphan told the news conference that the establishment of the 
council "in itself is not a solution" but a way to get the United Nations 
involved in administering Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the agreement, although not precise in all details -- including a date for 
a cease-fire -- was the first framework for peace to be achieved by all four 
parties to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The first indication that the 11 years of violence may be near an end came last 
month when the Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, 
the Soviet Union, China, France and Great Britain -- agreed on a formula under 
which the United Nations would settle the war. Hope gained momentum soon 
afterward when the three-party guerrilla coalition dominated by the Khmer Rouge 
approved the U.N. formula in principle. 
</P>
<P>
According to the formula worked out at the talks and announced Monday, the 
Phnom Penh government will receive six seats on the national council, while 
each of the three guerrilla factions will get two seats. Sihanouk has been 
proposed as chairman, but he said in a message from Beijing that he was ill and 
could not participate in politics for six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have now entered a new era when a comprehensive political settlement can be 
achieved," said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who chaired the talks 
with Edwige Avice of the French Foreign Office. "A lot of work is still ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement said the four factions accepted the U.N. plan for Cambodia "in 
its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, U.N. forces will separate the warring factions and supervise a 
cease-fire. At the same time, a U.N. civil administration will take over the 
running of key ministries such as the police and army to ensure evenhanded 
treatment of all parties in the interim period before an election can be held. 
U.N. officials have estimated that it will be one of the biggest peacekeeping 
operations in U.N. history. 
</P>
<P>
During its nearly four years in power, the Khmer Rouge tried to transform the 
country into a radical agrarian society, with an estimated 1 million people 
dying in the resulting upheaval. The Khmer Rouge was ousted in 1979 by Vietnam, 
whose forces invaded and installed Hun Sen in power. Vietnamese troops 
officially withdrew last year, but on Monday, even after signing the agreement, 
Khieu Samphan accused the Phnom Penh regime of continuing to harbor Vietnamese 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement marks a major concession on the part of the Khmer Rouge, which 
had previously refused to participate in an interim regime unless all four 
parties wielded equal power. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge is easily the most powerful of the three 
guerrilla groups in the country and recently has scored a number of military 
victories against the Phnom Penh regime, seizing control of the countryside and 
leaving only the cities in the hands of the Hun Sen government.

HONIG OUTLINES HIS MESSAGE FOR NEXT GOVERNOR

Gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson should "spell out in 
specifics" what they would do to improve California public schools, state Supt. 
of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering his annual "back-to-school" message at a Capitol news conference, 
Honig tried to play down his current school funding dispute with Gov. George 
Deukmejian and focus instead on what he hoped would be "a more cooperative 
relationship" with the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, a Democrat, has endorsed Feinstein, his party's choice for governor, but 
said, "I'll be able to work with either candidate successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Honig outlined his own "game plan for the '90s," to make California schools 
"the best in the nation, the best in the world," but warned that "it will not 
happen without the cooperation of the next governor -- we need a bipartisan 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Honig's program includes measures to increase school accountability, improve 
the assessment of pupil performance, strengthen the curriculum and place more 
decision-making authority in the hands of teachers and parents in local 
schools, rather than in large central bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
He said California schools have made substantial improvements in recent years, 
despite "a doubling of the number of kids in poverty, a doubling of 
limited-English speakers and a huge amount of growth." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade jumped by about 200,000 
this year to a total of almost 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
So far, neither Feinstein nor Wilson has made education a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has urged that state lottery revenue be used for a "jump start" 
program that would provide classes for all 4-year-olds so they would be better 
prepared to begin their regular school programs. 
</P>
<P>
She also supports a "teacher corps" for poverty-area schools, and favors 
lowering the percentage of votes required to pass local school bonds from 
two-thirds to a simple majority. Feinstein also has said she would restore $500 
million in 1990-91 education funding that Deukmejian has either vetoed or "set 
aside." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has not made a similar pledge. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wilson's early policy statements called for state-paid prenatal care, 
preschool education for all and the linking of schools with local social 
service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Honig attempted to keep the news conference focused on his proposals 
for the 1990s, and on his hopes for a better rapport with the next governor, he 
was unable to resist the temptation to throw a few more darts at Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the governor has cut the Department of Education budget by about 
one-third because "he's out to get us, one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
But the cuts mean the department will be unable to continue some of its 
activities, including assistance to school districts that are in financial 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 20 or 30 districts that are on very shaky ground and we can't do 
anything about it" because of the reduced budget, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
The schools chief also warned that if Deukmejian does not sign a bill now on 
his desk that would restore funding for the California Assessment Program, then 
statewide testing of 12th graders scheduled for December will have to be 
canceled and next spring's tests for third-, sixth- and eighth-graders will be 
in jeopardy.

FEINSTEIN BACKS TAX TO FIGHT DRUGS; WILSON LEANS IN FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Declaring that Californians are locked in a fight for their lives with 
international drug lords, Democrat Dianne Feinstein on Monday endorsed a ballot 
initiative that would add half a cent to the state sales tax to fight the 
state's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that underscored some of the similarities between the candidates for 
governor, Republican Pete Wilson promptly declared that, while not endorsing 
the measure, he "may very well" vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein announced her support for Proposition 133, which is sponsored by her 
running mate, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, after Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies briefed her in Carson on their battle with street gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's "Safe Streets Act" would raise an estimated $7.4 billion over four 
years, with 42% going for anti-drug education programs, 40% for new law 
enforcement efforts, 10% for prisons and jails and 8% for drug treatment. The 
McCarthy measure would also mandate full prison terms, without time off for 
good behavior, for felons convicted more than once on a variety of crimes, 
including the sale or possession for sale of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates spent Monday emphasizing their anti-drug and anti-crime 
programs, and Wilson unveiled a new campaign commercial praising his efforts to 
reduce California's crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy for me to support any increase in the state's sales tax," 
Feinstein said. "But the truth is we're locked in a battle for our lives in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that the action is likely to allow Wilson to brand her as a 
tax-and-spend Democrat, but she said the war on drugs cannot be waged with 
words alone. Any anti-drug program that does not have money to back it up is 
"pie in the sky," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers, Feinstein added, "don't pay much attention to talk. They pay 
attention to uniforms and undercover agents, a speedy trial and long sentences 
and knowing that they are going to be outgunned and they are going to lose the 
war. . . . They don't pay attention to politicians flexing their muscles, but 
can't deliver anything." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson did indeed try to tag Feinstein with the tax-and-spend label in a noon 
address to the Jewish Federation Council in Los Angeles -- but he specifically 
exempted the drug war from his criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't oppose the McCarthy initiative," he said when asked his position. "I 
don't think it is the ultimate, but I can't oppose it because it is true we 
need big dollars to fight drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed as to whether that meant he supported the measure, Wilson first 
answered "not necessarily." Asked if he would vote for it, he replied, "I may 
very well vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
In making her case for the initiative, Feinstein noted that California's 
counties, with primary law enforcement responsibility for much of the state, 
are near fiscal insolvency. Butte County, for one, has been on the verge of 
bankruptcy for months and at times can put only one sheriff's deputy into the 
field because of the financial squeeze, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic candidate acknowledged that voters are skeptical of giving 
politicians the power to spend more money. She said she believes voters would 
be willing to support the tax increase because Proposition 133 specifies 
exactly how the funds would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions of Feinstein's crime program include mandatory jail sentences for 
first-time drug sale convictions, appointment of a Cabinet-level drug czar in 
state government, longer jail terms for violent criminals, a speedup in the 
trial process, better interdiction of narcotics with use, if necessary, of 
full-time National Guard employees, and expanded drug rehabilitation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's recitation of her record irked Wilson, who also has favored 
mandatory jail time, longer terms for violent criminals, sex criminals and 
those who sell drugs to children, and a more vigorous battle against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything in her platform is an implicit endorsement of not only 
the things that I have proposed, but things which I have actually done in the 
federal level," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
During his speech to Jewish community leaders, Wilson came under sharp 
questioning for some of his positions. One questioner criticized Wilson's 
statement that he would seek to know the personal feelings of judicial 
candidates about the death penalty, while refusing to ask about their positions 
on abortion. Another asked Wilson, who says he favors abortion rights, how he 
could justify his votes against federal funding of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
A third questioner drew a sharp retort from Wilson when she asked about a 
recent newspaper column in which Feinstein expressed concern that Wilson's 
campaign may be anti-Semitic. She made the statement to columnist Ben 
Wattenberg in an apparent reference to Wilson's criticism of Feinstein's 
husband, Richard C. Blum. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that not only offensive but truly shocking," Wilson said. "I must say I 
think that is an example of the kind of thing that makes you wonder how much 
pressure people are going to be able to take before they do things they 
shouldn't do." 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad?: Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the Republican nominee, on Monday unveiled a campaign commercial 
targeted to address the issue his aides see as his most potent campaign weapon 
-- crime. The 60-second ad, airing across California, lauds Wilson's support 
for criminal justice legislation and, particularly, for Proposition 115, the 
initiative on the June ballot that overhauled the state's trial system to speed 
up trials and make it easier for prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson ad follows by several days the airing of a commercial by Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein that underscored her support for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The commercial opens with Wilson talking to crime victims, traveling on a 
campaign bus and in a cafe. "This man has been on a mission for 10 years to 
change a criminal justice system that was more responsive to the criminals than 
to the people," an announcer says. Wilson replies: "When you see something that 
is wrong, the purpose of being in government is to have the ability to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
"And fix it he did," the announcer says, "with a series of bold and sweeping 
reforms which became law in June." 
</P>
<P>
The ad goes on to quote Ventura County Dist. Atty. Mike Bradbury praising the 
initiative, and crime victim Colleen Campbell thanking Wilson for his support. 
</P>
<P>
At its close, the ad takes aim at Feinstein, saying she "didn't lift a finger 
for the crime victims initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Wilson did forcefully support the initiative, and its principal 
political organizers were closely allied with Wilson's campaign. He does not 
get credit for personally changing the law with "bold and sweeping reforms"; 
that goes to the voters who overwhelmingly approved Proposition 115. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, while saying she supported the measure, downplayed it during her 
primary campaign against Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who opposed 
the measure on the grounds that it would endanger abortion rights in 
California. Since its passage, Feinstein has vowed to enthusiastically enforce 
it, as has Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has proposed anti-crime legislation since 1982 from his post in the 
Senate. But Wilson's interests have been diversified, and it would be 
oversimplification to say he has been "on a mission" regarding crime.

MAN WHO SET SON AFIRE ACCUSED OF VIOLATING PAROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months after he was paroled, the man who set his son on fire in a Buena 
Park motel was back in prison Monday for apparently ducking out of an Oakland 
doughnut shop and eluding his parole agents for four hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
State prison officials said Charles David Rothenberg's whereabouts during that 
time remain a mystery, but he broke his parole terms by eluding one agent and 
lying to a second before showing up at an 11:30 a.m. job interview, where he 
was captured without resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 50, was taken to San Quentin state prison, where he will be held up 
to three months until a Board of Prisons hearing on the parole violation 
charges. If found guilty, Rothenberg could be imprisoned up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
David Rothenberg, who remains disfigured from the third-degree burns he 
suffered over 90% of his body in the 1983 fire, learned of Monday's episode 
when his mother picked him up after school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just . . . glad they caught him and he was a couple hundred miles away," 
said David, now 14 and a high school freshman. "If they didn't catch him I'd be 
scared, but I think after this he should be put in prison for life." 
</P>
<P>
Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said 
officials "don't know why he did this, because he certainly knew it was not 
allowed under his parole. We don't know why he would jeopardize what freedom he 
had to live on the outside . . . but it was a big mistake on his part." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time confirming where Rothenberg was paroled, Kindel said 
Rothenberg was en route to a job interview in Oakland, accompanied by a parole 
agent, when he was allowed to stop at a doughnut shop at 7:30 a.m. Monday. 
After "about a half hour, long enough to sit and have a cup of coffee and a 
doughnut," Rothenberg failed to emerge from the shop, Kindel said. When the 
parole agent went inside, he found that Rothenberg had slipped out a side or 
back door. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Rothenberg called a second parole agent and said he was at another 
location. The second agent arrived at the spot, but Rothenberg was not there, 
Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was missing at this point, not where he was supposed to be," Kindel said. 
"He deliberately eluded one agent and lied to the second, both of which are 
violations of his parole in that he was not cooperating with parole agents." 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Rothenberg, who was divorced from David's mother, took his son 
for what was to be a week's vacation in Upstate New York. Instead, he took him 
to Buena Park so they could visit Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
After seven days, he tried to persuade his ex-wife, Marie Hafdahl, to grant him 
more time with his son. She insisted that the boy be brought home. 
</P>
<P>
That night, March 3, 1983, Rothenberg took a jug of kerosene, doused the 
bedspread on which his 6-year-old son slept, lit a match and fled. He was 
captured a week later in San Francisco, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and 
other crimes linked to the fire, and was sentenced to 13 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
After serving 6 years, 5 months of his term, Rothenberg was released Jan. 24 
under what officials said was the tightest security ever provided for a 
California parolee. He was to live under 24-hour supervision by parole agents 
and to wear an electronic bracelet that would alert officials if he left 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we've said all along that we were not comfortable with paroling him, and 
today he made a very serious error in judgment," Kindel said.

POSSIBLE POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN KILLINGS PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
TASK FORCE: UNIT INVESTIGATING 43 PROSTITUTE KILLINGS SAYS IT IS LOOKING INTO 
ANY POLICE LINKS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF A SLAIN PROSTITUTE WHO TESTIFIED 
AGAINST OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The law enforcement task force investigating 43 unsolved killings of 
prostitutes since 1985 announced Monday that it had been restructured to 
include an investigation into possible police involvement in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The task force also defended its record of a single murder arrest during the 
two years of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first press conference given by the task force. During the 
conference, it was disclosed that one of the three divisions of the reorganized 
force will look solely into possible police misconduct, specifically 
allegations of officers' involvement with slain prostitute Donna Gentile, 22, 
who was killed in 1985 shortly after she had testified against two officers. 
That division is headed by a deputy state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
When Gentile's nude and battered body was discovered off Sunrise Highway in 
East County, her mouth had been stuffed with stones, which some investigators 
interpreted as meaning she had been killed in retaliation for her testimony at 
a police civil service hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of our investigation of prostitute deaths, we have uncovered 
allegations of police misconduct, which includes the fact that more than one 
officer was involved with Donna Gentile," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie 
Dumanis, the force spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis would not provide names, nor say whether the officers were still on the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Because of associations with Gentile, one police officer was fired and a 
lieutenant was demoted in 1985. The lieutenant has since been re-promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Although it had been widely speculated that police misconduct was one focus of 
the investigation, the task force would not publicly comment on the matter 
until Monday's press conference. One of the two other divisions of the task 
force is specifically investigating the Gentile killing, while the other is 
probing the slayings of the other prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis also announced the law enforcement affiliation of 11 new task force 
members, who have joined 10 others who are sorting through hundreds of possible 
leads in the prostitute killings. They include seven police officers, two 
district attorney investigators and Gary Schons, a deputy state attorney 
general from the San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is made up of investigators from the district attorney's office, 
the state attorney general's office, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department 
and the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Schons said the task force will collect any other information about police 
corruption and conduct its own prosecution if necessary, even if a case is not 
directly related to the prostitute slayings. 
</P>
<P>
No one would comment Monday on what other areas the task force might look into. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's some spinoff evidence on this, we'll refer it to (Police 
Department) internal affairs, send it to the grand jury or charge someone 
ourself," Schons said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the area of any police misconduct," Dumanis said, "we'll take the 
appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis and Schons Monday defended the task force's record, which includes one 
murder arrest in two years and the conviction of six other persons on charges 
of attempted murder, assault or kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis said the task force's conviction of "Rolodex madam" Karen Wilkening for 
pandering and conspiracy to obstruct justice and of her attorney Buford Wiley 
on a conspiracy charge also are proof of the group's progress. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis said the task force has not established a strong link between 
Wilkening, who headed a call-girl operation, and Gentile other than the fact 
that Wilkening employed prostitutes and Gentile was a prostitute. Wilkening has 
repeatedly denied knowing Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
Schons said the task force should not be criticized for its lack of progress in 
finding killers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have bodies dumped in the county that take weeks or months to find, and 
you can't even identify some of the victims. To try and identify a suspect is 
difficult, and to establish a case and try to prove someone did it is a 
monumental task," Schons said. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis would not comment on a task force search warrant served a month ago to 
the Fletcher Hills home of Thomas Irwin, also known as Shotgun Tom Kelly, a 
children's television host on KUSI-TV. 
</P>
<P>
The task force took a Rolodex, personal papers and 600 videotapes from his 
home, and said they were looking for tapes that included Sheriff John Duffy, 
former Police Chief Bill Kolender and "anything concerning the Karen Wilkening 
case," Kelly said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he routinely made humorous videotapes patterned after NBC's "The 
Tonight Show" that included his family and friends. One of the tapes includes 
Duffy, playing host, and Kolender as his guest. Kelly said the tape has nothing 
to do with Wilkening or any prostitutes, including Gentile, but was done as a 
prototype to sell to television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and Kolender have denied being on a videotape that includes prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he has a studio in the back of his home that he has used to film 
about 20 versions of the variety show. The rest of the tapes, he said, are 
cartoons, old movies and old television shows. 
</P>
<P>
Although his superiors at KUSI-TV are concerned about the investigation, Kelly 
said he is still employed and will continue to do his children's show in a 
couple of weeks. He is not filming now, he said, because the station is moving 
its studios. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the task force, who asked not be identified, said the tapes 
are a minor part of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes have been blown out of proportion," the source said. "They're just a 
very small part of a very big picture. It's fair to say that the videotapes 
(the task force is) looking for relate to Gentile. Who appears with her? Who 
can the task force talk to? There's no link right now with Duffy and Kolender, 
although if we ran across them on the same tape, it doesn't mean the task force 
wouldn't be interested." 
</P>
<P>
To help develop new leads, the task force Monday unveiled a clay model of what 
experts say is a reconstructed likeness of one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
The victim is known as "Pala Jane Doe" because police found her badly 
decomposed body on the Pala Indian Reservation in North County in October 1986. 
Based on the facial reconstruction, investigators believe she was white, 
5-foot-4, with dark brown hair and about 20. At the time she was found, she was 
wearing a white sweater, blue and white striped pants and white boots. 
</P>
<P>
She had four tattoos: a red rose above her right breast; a red heart on the 
inside of her left breast; a butterfly and a swastika on her right buttock; and 
a motorcycle wheel with wings and the letters H and D beside it on the left 
buttock. Police believe she may have belonged to a Harley-Davidson motorcycle 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Bove, a retired sheriff's deputy who is working as a crime scene 
investigator with the task force, said the technique is a first for a homicide 
investigation in San Diego County and may be used for some of the other victims 
whose bodies are severely decomposed. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, usually the last resort in seeking to identify a body after 
dental or fingerprint identification fail, dates back to the 1800s, according 
to Dr. Rodger Heglar, a forensic anthropologist who is a consultant for the San 
Diego County Medical Examiner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Heglar said the age, sex, race and height of the victims are determined by 
using traces of the skeletal system. From there, tissue depths are measured, 
and the clay is applied, sometimes to the victim's skull. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the identify of the woman is asked to call the 
task force at 260-6400.

PALMDALE OKS $2 MILLION FOR RECREATION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palmdale officials said Monday that they hope to open a long-delayed indoor 
recreation center by the end of the year, financing the project with $2 million 
from city redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to renovate a former toy store and turn it into a youth-oriented 
center that would include a full basketball court, two smaller basketball 
courts and areas for aerobics, exercise and studying, according to a city staff 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting as directors of the city's redevelopment agency, Palmdale City Council 
members agreed Friday to buy the 32,000-square-foot building from Van Nuys 
businessman Alex Kaminar for $1.7 million. They also agreed to spend $300,000 
on remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, teen-agers and others in the Antelope Valley city have complained that 
Palmdale, despite its tremendous growth, has no indoor recreation facilities 
where youngsters can play sports or just socialize in a supervised setting. 
</P>
<P>
The city had negotiated for months to arrange a 10-year lease of the building, 
but last month switched to an offer to buy. Kaminar said he accepted because he 
feared that the city might otherwise try to acquire the property through 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
The new center will be in the heart of downtown Palmdale, at 815 E. Avenue Q-6. 
The building had been a supermarket for years and more recently was a toy store 
until it closed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The stalled lease negotiations put the center months behind schedule. It would 
have been paid for with city general funds. The money became available this 
summer when the city decided to scale down plans for a performing arts center.

MAN FACES TRIAL IN ANTI-JEWISH ACTS AIMED AT CATHOLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Arleta man was ordered Monday to stand trial for allegedly terrorizing his 
neighbor by attempting to set fire to the man's house, shooting out the kitchen 
windows and placing burning crosses on the neighbor's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Paul Myron Downing, 28, who also is accused of spray-painting 
swastikas on the man's house, thought his Roman Catholic neighbor was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, charged with multiple counts of arson, making terrorist threats, 
shooting at an inhabited dwelling and desecrating a religious symbol, was 
ordered to stand trial after a two-day preliminary hearing in San Fernando 
Municipal Court. Judge John C. Gunn set arraignment for Downing on Sept. 24 in 
San Fernando Superior Court. Downing apparently mistook John J. Ruiz, 55, who 
lives in the 13900 block of Nordhoff Street, to be Jewish because Ruiz 
subscribes to the Jewish Journal, said Ruiz's attorney, Kenneth L. Kazan. Ruiz, 
a purchasing agent for a wholesale company, testified last week that his mail 
appeared to have been opened before the attacks began in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the continuing attacks, most of which occurred late at 
night or early in the morning, investigators said. Ruiz was usually at home 
with his wife Raquel, 49, his daughter, Jennifer, 20 and his son James, 25, 
Kazan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that during the alleged hate campaign, members of his family took 
turns keeping watch at night because they feared for their lives. Ruiz has 
lived at the Nordhoff Street house for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Downing left a series of crudely worded, threatening notes 
on Ruiz's property. One note stated: "We who kill shall remove you from here no 
matter what." It was signed "B.O.A.P.," which prosecutors said stands for 
Brotherhood of Aryan People. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they had not determined if Downing acted alone or is a member 
of an organization. Tzivia Schwartz, an attorney for the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'nai B'rith, said she has not heard of a group calling itself the 
Brotherhood of Aryan People, but said Downing may have been referring to the 
Aryan Brotherhood, a prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
Mark D. Pearson, a Los Angeles City Fire Department arson investigator, 
testified Monday that Downing confessed during an interview to starting five of 
the fires. 
</P>
<P>
The blazes charred the kitchen door of the house, burned part of the garage and 
an adjacent guest room and damaged a motorcycle, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Downing also allegedly set fire to an oleander bush on Ruiz's property. The 
fires were quickly extinguished and did not spread into the house, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Arthur Wynn suggested during cross-examination Monday that his 
client may have a history of psychiatric troubles. He referred to an arson 
investigator's report in which Downing is quoted as saying he received 
psychiatric care until 1987. Downing also reportedly told investigators that he 
had stopped taking medication to control his temper because "he didn't feel he 
needed them anymore," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said outside court Monday that he and his family will never overcome the 
emotional trauma caused by the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is not back to normal," Ruiz said. "We'll always bear the emotional scars 
from this thing."

CLEANUP BEGUN AT ABANDONED PLATING SHOP; 
</P>
<P>
HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS: THE EPA SAYS THE FORMER OWNERS OF THE BURBANK FIRM CAN BE 
FINED UP TO THREE TIMES THE $1.3-MILLION COST TO RID THE WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday began cleaning up thousands of 
gallons of hazardous chemicals at a former Burbank metal plating shop that was 
abandoned by its owners. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect the removal of about 36,000 gallons of industrial solvents and 
other chemicals at Dynamic Plating to take about five weeks. The action is 
designed to prevent reactive chemicals from mixing. Although the chemicals used 
in various plating processes do not pose a significant health risk by 
themselves, they are potentially very dangerous when mixed, said Dan Shane, who 
is coordinating the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency work order issued by the EPA said the combination of acids with 
cyanide solutions stored nearby could cause the release of hydrogen cyanide, 
which "would be a major disaster." EPA spokesman Terry Wilson declined to 
elaborate or speculate on the effects of such a gas release. 
</P>
<P>
Tests also will be conducted to determine if seepage from the shop has 
contributed to ground water contamination in the southeast San Fernando Valley. 
Soil samples already taken at the site indicate a "significant amount" of 
solvents have seeped into the ground over the years. High levels of solvents 
were detected at depths of up to 55 feet and officials suspect that other 
chemicals also might have found their way into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
The building was built as Army barracks during World War II and had been used 
as a plating shop since at least 1959. Because of the wood-framed building's 
age and dilapidated condition, officials feared there was a significant risk of 
chemicals spilling or mixing. 
</P>
<P>
The shop, which is in a light-industrial area near Burbank and Victory 
boulevards, has been closed since January, according to city records. At that 
time, city officials cited shop owners Frank Guerrero and Chuck Ceballos for 
exceeding their permitted limits on the amount of waste they were flushing into 
the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
An assessment of the shop by the EPA in August revealed several open vats and 
sumps containing 36,000 gallons of chemicals and various industrial wastes. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about a dozen workers prepared the site for cleanup by removing 
empty containers and evaluating the potential risks. A portable meteorological 
station was erected to forecast the spread of a toxic cloud in the event any of 
the chemicals combine during the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the cleanup will cost about $1.3 million. The EPA can fine Guerrero 
and Ceballos up to three times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
But Guerrero and Ceballos have indicated to city and federal officials that 
they are unable to pay for the cleanup. Sidney Troxell, an attorney for the two 
men, declined to discuss how they plan to settle the bill. He said Guerrero and 
Ceballos were considering declaring bankruptcy, but had not made a final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said the first priority at the site will be to pump reactive chemicals 
into storage tanks and remove them, thus eliminating the immediate risk of 
toxic mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Work then will concentrate on removing chemical containers and disposing of 
them in an approved facility. Tests also will be conducted to determine the 
amount of contamination caused by chemicals seeping into the soil.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE ELECTIONS CALLED UNFAIR; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: TWO COUNCIL MEMBERS CITED THE PRACTICE OF ALLOWING ONLY THOSE ON 
THE ADVISORY PANEL TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES.

<P>
Two Los Angeles City Council members on Monday said they don't like the way 
people are being picked for a citizens panel that helps guide the city's 
efforts to renovate deteriorating neighborhoods in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
After one critic said it was easier for blacks to vote in the South during the 
segregation era, Councilman Richard Alatorre said he was putting city 
redevelopment officials "on notice that I'm not satisfied that this election 
was conducted properly." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre referred to a Feb. 13 election to fill seats on the North Hollywood 
Project Area Committee, which advises the city's powerful Community 
Redevelopment Agency as it attempts to reinvigorate North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina didn't go that far, but urged postponement of 
another election set for tonight to fill 12 vacancies on the citizens 
committee. Molina was particularly uncomfortable with rules that permit only 
current board members to vote to fill vacancies. "It just seems odd," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She believes that a wide range of residents and property owners ought to be 
allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawmakers, acting in their capacity as members of the council's 
Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, were told they had limited 
authority to correct problems they saw, because these community-level 
organizations operate independently of the council. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Council President John Ferraro, who represents North Hollywood, told 
the committee that her boss wants tonight's elections to proceed, as does Don 
Spivack, a top redevelopment agency official. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack said the committee currently does not have enough members for a quorum, 
which hampers its ability to advise the Community Redevelopment Agency on 
several pending projects, including a proposed Vineland-Magnolia shopping 
center, he said. "If we don't have an election, the community won't have a 
voice," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
The North Hollywood committee's elections have been enmeshed in controversy 
since February when the panel began trying to fill numerous vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
In March, one election effort was aborted after a scuffle broke out at a 
committee meeting. A brief arm-wrestling match broke out again at Monday's 
meeting between CRA critic Howard O. Watts and the council committee's 
sergeant-at-arms, after Molina told Watts to stop verbally attacking the city 
staff. Watts finally sat down. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that the citizens committee is merely a tool of the CRA and 
business interests seeking to capitalize on the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Chris Sutton, who represents the dissidents, said the committee failed 
to adequately notify affected people of the February election and then made the 
rules for qualifying to vote so onerous it was difficult for anyone but 
insiders to win. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more difficult to vote in a PAC election in Los Angeles than it was for a 
black to vote in Mississippi in 1965," Sutton told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Spivack, deputy administrator for the CRA, said the Project Area Committee 
election in February was legal and that tonight's election would meet the 
requirements of both state law and the committee's own bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
Ada Klevans, chairwoman of the PAC, called the committee's critics "naysayers" 
who are spewing "garbage." They are free to get elected to the PAC, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting is to be held at the First Baptist Church, 11210 Otsego St., 
North Hollywood. Potential candidates may register starting at 6:30 p.m. The 
regular meeting starts at 7.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PICKUP DRIVER SOUGHT IN BICYCLIST'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a pickup truck that struck and killed a bicyclist near Palmdale 
was being sought Monday by the California Highway Patrol, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Miguel Siordia said a 28-year-old Littlerock man was fatally injured 
Sunday while riding west alongside Avenue T near East 106th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose identity was not released, was hit by a lime-green flatbed 
pickup, Siordia said. The driver kept going after striking the victim about 
6:30 p.m., even when a motorist who witnessed the accident drove alongside him 
and told him to go back to the accident scene, Siordia said.

<P>
Water from a pool being drained into the sewer system caused more than 200,000 
gallons of sewage to overflow into Glorietta Bay in Coronado on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The spill started at 9 a.m. when the water caused an overflow in the 2000 block 
of Strand Way into the bay, according to county health officials. The flow was 
stopped at 11 a.m. Pollution warning signs have been posted in the area.

Police are looking for two men who robbed two banks in unrelated incidents 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 1 p.m., a man walked into a Bank of America branch in the 700 
block of University Avenue in Hillcrest, said he had a gun and demanded some 
cash, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The robber fled from the bank with less than $500, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police the robber was white, about 5-foot-5 and 120 pounds and 
in his 30s. He had a thin build, short straight blond hair and wore gold-rimmed 
glasses and a pink florescent baseball cap. Robinson said the same man is 
believed to have robbed at least two other banks in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, a man walked into the Home Federal Bank branch in the 
3900 block of 30th Street, said he had a gun and demanded money from a teller 
with a note that was stuffed inside a passbook-type folder. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson did not know how much money the man got away with, but police suspect 
he is responsible for 12 other bank robberies around San Diego totaling more 
than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as Latino in his late 30s, with short, thick black 
hair, 5-foot-3 to 5-foot-10. The man was last seen heading south on 30th 
Street, Robinson said.

The City Council on Monday formally voted to ask the Port District to study the 
feasibility of relocating air cargo business from busy Lindbergh Field to 
city-owned Brown Field on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting on a recommendation of one of its committees, wants the San 
Diego Unified Port District, which operates Lindbergh Field, to find out if 
moving cargo activity to Brown Field would make more space available at 
Lindbergh.

PEYER APPEALS TO STATE HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former California Highway Patrolman and convicted murderer Craig Peyer has 
asked the state Supreme Court to overturn his conviction in the 1986 slaying of 
San Diego State University student Cara Knott. 
</P>
<P>
A secretary in the office of attorney Christopher J. Schatz, Peyer's appellate 
attorney, said the appeal was filed with the high court Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-page brief filed by Schatz contains the same issues that he raised in a 
previous appeal filed with the state 4th District Court of Appeal in April. In 
June, the 4th District court, in a 65-page opinion, rejected every challenge 
raised by the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In the Supreme Court brief, Schatz again accused prosecutor Paul Pfingst of 
misconduct during Peyer's criminal trial. Pfingst called Peyer a "predator" 
with an "appetite" for young women in his closing argument to the jury. Schatz 
argued that Pfinst's portrayal of Peyer unfairly tainted him in the eyes of the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
Peyer, 40, was a California Highway Patrol officer for 13 years. He is serving 
a 25-year-to-life sentence in a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Peyer's attorney also argued that Pfingst acted illegally when he told the jury 
in his closing argument that many questions about the killing remained 
unanswered because Peyer failed to testify. The U.S. Constitution allows an 
accused person the right to refuse to testify at his trial if he or she so 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
Schatz also argued that Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman erred when he 
allowed 30 young women to testify about nighttime stops initiated by Peyer on 
the same Interstate 15 off-ramp where Knott, 20, was killed the night of Dec. 
27, 1986. The women testified that Peyer engaged them in long, personal 
conversations on the darkened Mercy Road off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Pfingst offered the women's testimony to show that Peyer had a pattern of 
stopping young women and to show jurors that he also had the opportunity to 
stop Knott on the night she was murdered.

SCHOOL TO STAY PUT IN THE WAC

San Diego State will remain in the Western Athletic Conference for at least 
another athletic season after the current one. Athletic Director Fred Miller 
said he did not notify the WAC of any plans to leave by Sept. 1 -- the date by 
which universities must tell the conference if they intend to secede after the 
current athletic season. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some published reports of the WAC talking about expansion, 
which I think is healthy," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, nothing is new on the university's hopes to join the Pac-10. That 
conference announced a couple of weeks ago that it does not intend to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they're not going to expand now," Miller said. "We need a couple of 
years to catch up and expand our attendance. . . . We have to up our attendance 
figures. They are very soft -- they are not Pac-10 numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the Aztecs have sold about 13,000 football season tickets so far -- 
about 400 or 500 more than last season. 
</P>
<P>
Injury Report: For SDSU, linebacker Lou Foster (hamstring) is probable for 
Saturday's game at home against Cal State Long Beach, defensive lineman Steve 
Matuszewicz (ankle) is questionable and defensive back Zac Stokes (shoulder) is 
doubtful. For Cal State Long Beach, backup tight end Bryon Hamilton (shoulder) 
is questionable. Linebacker Jamal Duff did not run in Monday's practice because 
of a bruised thigh. . . . Coach Al Luginbill said there would be no major 
personnel changes on special teams. "We evaluated and will give everybody the 
opportunity to correct what they did wrong on Saturday. This will be it. If 
corrections are not made, we'll give others an opportunity," he said. . . . 
Luginbill said he was impressed that "30 to 40" players attended a 
non-mandatory film session before Monday's team meeting. "There was legitimate 
interest and concern as to the way we executed Saturday," he said. "I go the 
feeling they're an extremely upset group of young men." SCOTT MILLER

The San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts, San Diego's leading modern 
dance presenter, will move into the vanguard of dance education next week when 
it launches "City Moves," an ambitious dance education and performance project 
for San Diego schoolchildren. The program was outlined at a press conference 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"City Moves" will involve 250 children ages 8 through 18, as well as 50 local 
dancers, in its inaugural year. It will include a nine months of auditions at 
schools and community centers, master classes, rehearsals and public 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're doing is unique in the country," foundation director Fred 
Colby said. "This is the first (educational program) organized and run by a 
presenter." 
</P>
<P>
The school year will culminate with five performances of "The Terrible Tale of 
Ringmaster Twigg," a new dance-theater piece commissioned for the project. The 
work will be choreographed by project director William Conrow, who wrote the 
show, and other area dance makers, including Three's Company artistic director 
Jean Isaacs; Patricia Sandback, director of SDSU's dance program, and Stage 
Seven artistic director Katherine Irey. 
</P>
<P>
Performances are scheduled for Memorial Day weekend at the San Diego Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 students from the San Diego Unified School District's "Young at Art 
Program" will help create the sets, costumes and music. Five visual artists 
from the "Young at Arts Program" were commissioned to work with the students on 
that portion of the project. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans Bob Willey and Christopher Penney will compose the original music, 
and Philip Matzigkeit of the "Young at Art" program is charged with designing 
the decor. 
</P>
<P>
" 'City Moves' will be one of the largest theatrical events ever presented in 
San Diego," Colby said. The project is meant "to significantly raise San 
Diego's appreciation and support of dance and dance education." 
</P>
<P>
"During the first three weeks," beginning in early October, "we'll be putting 
on presentations to show the kids what it's all about," said Albert Rodewald, a 
foundation spokesman. "That ought to get 7,000 or 8,000 kids exposed." 
</P>
<P>
Half the young dancers for "City Moves" will be selected by audition from among 
the 20 schools participating this year. The remaining students, as well as the 
adult dancers, will be chosen through auditions at eight participating 
community centers throughout San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the cast will be culled from high schools and another quarter will 
come from junior and middle schools; the remaining half will come from 
elementary schools. There will be no tuition charges for any of the 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, known for presenting well-known dance companies from out of 
town, plans to use this program as a means of nurturing San Diego's own dance 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been that concern that we're importing dance, and not part of 
the local dance community," Colby said. "But we've always seen the value of 
bringing in the greats like the Joffrey, ABT, Martha Graham. Now you can see 
the results in the growth of the dance community. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to the conclusion that we had an obligation to the community," he 
said. "It was important for us to give something back, and there's been no real 
programs to educate children in dance in the San Diego schools. I personally 
have strong political and social concerns, and I believe (this project) is a 
valuable tool for solving some of our social problems. This will bring people 
together -- black, white, brown, whatever. There's only two ways to do this: 
sports and the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project will come from a variety of private and public sources, 
including Pacific Telesis Foundation, which provided the seed grant of $25,000, 
and the San Diego Unified Port District, which is kicking in $46,000 to 
underwrite the commissioned work that caps off the first year of the project. 
</P>
<P>
However, Colby said, "we still need to raise an additional $60,000 in 
contributions before all aspects of the project can be realized. We have three 
other grant applications out now, and we're very confident we'll achieve that 
goal, because the response so far has been ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the community to come to those performances," he said. "That's why 
we're keeping the ticket costs down to $5. We're also trying to get more 
corporate support" for free tickets, he said.

The setting could be an establishing shot in a rock 'n' roll documentary. On a 
residential alley just off a fast-food boulevard in North County stands a 
weathered, white-washed shack. Inside, two young musicians are paying sweaty 
dues in pursuit of the elusive grail of a recording contract. Blasts of 
amplified guitar and drums provide a rude, intermittent counterpoint to the 
passive hiss of nearby traffic. When they stop playing, everything is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
That quintessentially American scene has its counterparts in a thousand 
neighborhoods. But this isn't just another garage band working off youthful 
energy while imagining themselves before a sea of Bic lighters in a sold-out 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist-vocalist Rue Phillips, 27, is a transplanted Briton whose rock resume 
includes work with Ozzy Osbourne, Jack Bruce, a former bassist for Cream, and 
Black Sabbath's Bill Ward. 
</P>
<P>
London-born drummer Kofi Baker is the 21-year-old son of Ginger Baker, drummer 
for the legendary '60s band, Cream. 
</P>
<P>
From first impressions, the two would seem unlikely collaborators. Phillips, 
who commutes to rehearsal from his home in Seal Beach, is upbeat, friendly, 
optimistic. He favors the "classic" '70s rock of Led Zeppelin, Billy Joel and 
Elton John, and, accordingly, he tries to write songs that will appeal to the 
rock mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Baker is serious and withdrawn. The fact that he left a fiancee, 
family and friends, and steady work in London drumming for Steve Marriott, to 
toil in this musty, cramped garage with Phillips stirs his natural pessimism; 
Baker can always find the dark cloud surrounding the silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
As contentious as the team is, it was more so in a former incarnation. A year 
ago, Phillips and Baker were rehearsing in England as two-thirds of a trio that 
included Malcolm Bruce, the son of Cream bassist Jack Bruce. Mac Falk, of the 
Solana Beach-based Falk and Morrow Talent, was their manager, and he had 
Atlantic Records poised to sign them to a recording contract. But, at the 
eleventh hour, the teen-age Bruce backed out, citing, among other things, 
unpreparedness for the big-time spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just as well that he left," says Phillips. "We were afraid people would 
only be interested in us because of the Son-of-Cream angle. And anyway, Malcolm 
and Ko didn't get along very well." 
</P>
<P>
In a re-creation of the hostilities that characterized their fathers' 
relationship during Cream's heyday, the younger Bruce and Baker quarreled 
constantly. During a particularly rancorous exchange, Kofi Baker took a swing 
at Malcolm Bruce and missed, instead hitting the wall and shattering a bone in 
his hand. He balked at inactivity, however, and played several gigs with his 
hand wrapped in a soft cast. "Still got a scar from that," says Baker in a 
barely penetrable Cockney accent as he proffers a fist for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Falk salvaged the project and began recording Baker and Phillips 
as a duo. These days, Falk is concentrating on producing the musicians' studio 
demos, leaving the business dealings to the potentially powerful management 
team of former Atlantic Records vice president John Carter and Chase Williams, 
who also manages Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Reportedly, several record 
companies have expressed interest in the twosome, which calls itself 
Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
Baker likes jazz and African music, and his contributions to the team effort 
are complex rhythms that would seem to counter Phillips' striving for 
accessibility. But one soon learns that the Baker-Phillips polarity is an 
essential component in the dynamic of their creative relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a certain amount of madness goes with genius, you know?" chirps 
Phillips in defense of his partner's contrary tendencies. Phillips is the 
portrait of the rock 'n' roll pirate as he sips coffee in a fast-food emporium 
around the corner from the garage. With his open waistcoat, American Indian 
chest ornaments, skin-tight pants and boots, Phillips contrasts not only with 
the goose-necking locals in their T-shirts and shorts, but also with the 
shirtless, sweat-pants clad Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"Ko is an amazing player," he continues, "and we're always battling because all 
he cares about is creating intricate rhythms, while I try to keep things fairly 
straightforward so people will like our songs. I like to think of me and Ko as 
the positive and negative on a battery. When you put them together they create 
real sparks. The combination can move mountains." He smiles conspiratorially. 
"It's very powerful." 
</P>
<P>
The songs on Commonwealth's demo validate that interest. Phillips is a 
versatile vocalist and a keen song architect capable of combining melodic line 
and rock-solid structure into a harmonious whole. The material exhibits those 
characteristics of invention and idiosyncratic subtlety that appeal to the 
discriminating musician, but without sacrificing the visceral directness of 
hard rock. The balance struck between Baker's complex drumming and Phillips's 
pop sense is effective and invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
In its pairing of floating vocal harmonies over a rumbling rhythm track, 
"Rhymes and Reasons" recalls such early Cream tunes as "I Feel Free." The 
suggestion causes Baker to start. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very strange," he says. "Me dad never played three over four on any 
Cream song." As is his penchant, Kofi Baker has reduced the song's varied 
elements to an equation of multiple-meter rhythms. A minute later, he excuses 
himself and returns to the garage and his beloved drums. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has spent his six weeks in Southern California practicing on his kit and 
precious little else. He sleeps on the sofa in Falk's home and plays drums 
every day from mid-morning until late at night, breaking only for food. He 
takes most of his meals at Kentucky Fried Chicken because it's handy and 
expeditious. That he insists on spending most of his waking hours in this 
sweatbox is testimony to the single-mindedness of the aspiring virtuoso. There 
are no windows in the garage, and, with the door closed on a sweltering summer 
day, the temperature inside can soar above 100 stifling degrees. 
</P>
<P>
One approaches the subject of Baker's lineage with caution. Ginger Baker walked 
out on his wife and family when Kofi was 9. The kid thereafter took up the 
drums on his own initiative and became so good that, as a teen-ager, he was 
playing the jazz clubs in London with such British stalwarts as saxophonist 
Dick Heckstall-Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 15 years, I've seen me dad maybe two or three times," says Baker. 
"He might have made a general suggestion or two, but otherwise he's never 
taught me a thing about drums." For both personal and professional reasons, 
then, Kofi is understandably sensitive to misconceptions about the roles that 
his famous father and Cream have played in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Associations, however, are just as understandably unavoidable. As Cream's 
rhythmic helmsman, the elder Baker forever altered the lot of the rock drummer, 
who traditionally was little more than an anonymous timekeeper. Baker 
popularized a playing style in which his feet were as active as his hands in 
creating sophisticated rhythms. His extended solos inspired generations of rock 
drummers to pursue virtuosity on the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Kofi's practice kit resembles his father's in its incorporation of twin kick 
drums, but mention of the similarity elicits a mild reproach. "I don't know 
what use the second kick drum is," he says. "It's a waste, actually; I can do 
everything with one foot that can be done with two." With that, Baker launches 
into a jaw-slackening demonstration of manual and pedal dexterity -- during 
which, at one point, each hand and each foot is playing in a different 
time-signature. At 21, the boy appears to have surpassed the father's technical 
mastery. 
</P>
<P>
"Ko played at a party in L.A. not long ago," laughs Phillips. "Ginger was 
there, and, after Ko played I asked him what he thought. He said, "If he wasn't 
me own son, I'd step on his goddamn hands!" 
</P>
<P>
Phillips plays a tape of some songs the two had recently recorded during 
rehearsal. The newer material sounds even more ambitious than the original 
demo, and in discussing its strengths the duo is soon at odds over various 
aspects of the arrangement. To an observer, it appears that their quest for a 
record deal is the duo's only consistent common ground. But even in that 
regard, they are motivated by entirely different muses. 
</P>
<P>
"My life's goal is to write a 'classic' song, something that people will listen 
to for years," states Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
For someone of his prodigious skills, Baker's demands are less lofty. "All I 
need," he says, "is a soundproof room and me drum kit, and I'd be happy for the 
rest of me life."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIERO'S REPLACEMENT IS A BONUS FOR S.D. OPERA FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the desertion of soprano Diana Soviero from San Diego Opera's upcoming "La 
Traviata" production, local audiences will have the opportunity to hear soprano 
Christine Weidinger. The opera's general director, Ian Campbell, engaged 
Weidinger to replace Soviero, the headstrong diva who broke her local contract 
for a chance to sing at the Paris Opera. 
</P>
<P>
If this news upset some San Diego Opera subscribers, the choice of Weidinger 
should ease their distress. 
</P>
<P>
A regular singer with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, Weidinger made a 
stunning impression in the company's 1989 production of Rossini's "Tancredi." 
Although the production was tailor-made for mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who 
sang the title role, and featured the budding coloratura tenor Chris Merritt, 
Weidinger's brilliant singing outshone that of the vaunted superstars. Later 
this month, Weidinger returns to the Music Center Opera stage to sing Elettra 
in Mozart's "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Phoenix, Weidinger won the Metropolitan Opera auditions in 1972 and 
made her Met debut the following season as Musetta in Puccini's "La Boheme." 
The able soprano did graduate work at California State University at 
Northridge, but like many American singers, Weidinger nurtured her career 
abroad. She has sung in most of the German-speaking opera houses from the 
Deutsche Oper Berlin to Hamburg Opera, Frankfurt Opera and the Vienna State 
Opera. In Italy she has sung bel canto roles and has performed a fair sampling 
of Verdi roles on the French opera stage. 
</P>
<P>
Vocally, Soviero has always been a welcome addition to the San Diego Opera 
stage, although her mercurial temperament offstage has been no secret. Her 
current cavalier behavior seems doubly culpable, however. If diva Soviero 
thought she was doing San Diego a favor by agreeing to sing the title role in 
this season's "La Traviata" production, she asked the local company for a favor 
in return. Soviero's management specifically requested that Bernard Uzan, 
Soviero's husband, be contracted as stage director for the production. Campbell 
granted this request, and Uzan is still slated to make his directorial debut 
here next year in "La Traviata." 
</P>
<P>
As opera buffs know, the meaning of traviata is "wayward woman." Perhaps 
Soviero has taken the character of one of her signature roles a bit too 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Going it alone. Though many performing musicians eagerly seek the shelter and 
security of a university teaching position, pianist Nicolas Reveles is bucking 
the trend. After spending more than a decade on the faculty of the University 
of San Diego, Reveles has resigned his post -- tenure and all -- to assume the 
unfettered role of a free-lance musician. Sunday at 7 p.m. in San Diego's First 
United Methodist Church, Reveles will play a solo recital of Beethoven, 
Schubert and Ravel. Performance is a musical activity he intends to increase in 
his post-pedagogical phase. 
</P>
<P>
In parallel fashion, Reveles has taken a general leave of absence from his 
responsibilities as a priest in the San Diego diocese. The 42-year-old musician 
stated that throughout his career he has enjoyed a creative tension between his 
musical calling and his priestly vocation. 
</P>
<P>
"But for last few years it has been a negative one, and these two aspects of my 
life have been at loggerheads. Although my priestly obligations on the 
university campus have been minimal, on weekends I was always on call to say 
Mass wherever I was needed throughout the diocese." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Reveles' mid-life gear-shifting was motivated by the need to devote 
himself to the regimen of keyboard practice required by a serious performer and 
to complete composition projects that remained in limbo for lack of time. In 
addition to his teaching load at USD and his administrative duties for the 
music department, he ran the school's liturgical music program as an 
educational arm of the San Diego diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface of these pragmatic concerns, however, Reveles admitted his 
disenchantment with the Catholic church's overall lack of appreciation for 
whole artistic endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 20th Century, I think the church has really blown it in terms of the 
arts. For many centuries the church was at the forefront of promoting the arts. 
I think the understanding that the church has of the arts is very limited." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to musical performance, Reveles will continue scoring and composing 
for the stage. For the Old Globe's production last season of C.P. Taylor's "And 
a Nightingale Sang," Reveles did the musical arrangements and recorded the 
piano music "played" by one of the actors. Since the Old Globe and USD have 
cooperated for the last three years in the university's M.F.A. drama 
curriculum, Reveles has worked on a number of scores for these student 
productions, has taught scoring to the student composers and has coached the 
actors in singing. Even though he has resigned from USD, he will continue to 
work with the drama program as an adjunct professor, the academic 
responsibility that brought him the most satisfaction when he taught for the 
music department. 
</P>
<P>
Reveles' recitals after Sunday's Linder Hall performance at First United 
Methodist include a program of Christmas music for piano at St. Brigid's Church 
in Pacific Beach in December and an all-Mozart recital in February at San Diego 
Public Library.

Culture in East County. The 12-piece ensemble Symphony Brass will inaugurate 
the fall classical concert series Monday with an 8:30 p.m. concert at El 
Cajon's East County Performing Arts Center. Conductor Ethan Dulsky will lead 
his brass buddies in a basically Baroque program that ranges from Benedetto 
Marcello to J. S. Bach. The concert series promises to bring a range of world 
music from Kawambe African Drum and Dance Ensemble, Oct. 1, to South Indian 
violinist Vjayam Ramaswanny, Oct. 15. The series is one of the most economical 
in the area -- nine concerts for a mere $60 -- and is also offered in 
conjunction with music appreciation courses at San Diego State University and 
Grossmont College.

POLITICS: LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ACTED TO SLASH SPENDING IN GOVERNOR'S ABSENCE. 
CRITICS BRANDED IT AN ELECTION STUNT.

In the latest installment in a chaotic political saga in Massachusetts, Lt. 
Gov. Evelyn Murphy said Monday that she was ending her candidacy for the 
Democratic nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
When Gov. Michael S. Dukakis left the state last Friday on a 13-day trade 
mission to Europe, Murphy seized the moment, as acting governor, to issue an 
executive order drastically slashing state spending. But the move appeared to 
backfire, with critics charging that it was a political stunt to improve her 
chances in the Sept. 18 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for business as usual," Murphy said Monday in announcing 
her decision to withdraw from the race. "It is not the time for politics as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
Tainted in large part by her association with the increasingly unpopular 
administration of Dukakis, Murphy had been trailing consistently in her race 
against former Atty. Gen. Frank Bellotti and Boston University President John 
R. Silber. A newspaper poll released last Thursday showed Murphy with only 15% 
of the Democratic vote, against 37% for Bellotti and 28% for Silber. Her 
withdrawal is expected to help Bellotti against the more conservative Silber. 
</P>
<P>
After Dukakis left the state, Murphy announced a plan calling for a 25% 
reduction in state managerial positions, cuts in state salaries for those 
earning more than $40,000 and a 10% decrease in the state's 64,000 employees. 
She called also for the sale of the Hynes Convention Center, a state-owned 
facility in Boston that has been a steady money-loser. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the moves were necessary to combat the state's deteriorating fiscal 
condition. The state's deficit is so large that Massachusetts' bond ratings 
have slipped to the lowest in the nation. In July, after a long struggle with 
the Legislature, Dukakis signed a $13.4-billion budget that included the 
largest tax increase in the state's history. But, in August, tax revenues fell 
$150 million short of projections. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Statehouse Monday, Murphy said that she was 
withdrawing in part because "the political dispute about my decisions is 
diverting attention away from the very serious problems that made them 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"This state cannot afford another deficit discovered at the end of another 
quarter or another year or even at the end of another month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of her decision to issue the executive order, Murphy added: "Now there can be 
no confusion. It is an honest and necessary act of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Longabaugh, Murphy's campaign manager, said in an interview that Murphy, 
who holds a doctorate in economics, "knew last week when she signed the 
executive orders that she was taking a drastic step that would have 
repercussions on her campaign. She knew it was drastic medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew that her candidacy was a long shot," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy had been an outspoken advocate of abortion rights and the right to 
privacy. In a tepid endorsement for the former attorney general, she called 
Bellotti "the candidate closest to the values that are important to me." Murphy 
said she would cast her own vote for Bellotti. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's campaign had suffered from a budgetary crisis of its own. Bellotti and 
Silber, the iconoclastic and unpredictable university president, have blanketed 
the air waves with radio and television advertisements, compared to only a few 
such efforts by Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Republican campaign, polls show former U.S. Atty. William Weld has been 
rising rapidly in his campaign against Steve Pierce, a member of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Murphy's decision to bow out of the Democratic race, Dukakis, 
in Paris, complimented Murphy for running "a strong and progressive" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And, said the governor: "I know something about disappointment in politics."

Speed traps have long been a spoiler for motorists. Now, get ready for 
pollution traps. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Stedman, a University of Denver chemistry professor, spent four days 
recently along Chicago's busy Eisenhower Expressway testing a new system that 
he designed to spot badly polluting cars as they drive on entry or exit ramps. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials here hope Stedman's invention will one day become an 
integral tool in the fight against excessive exhaust emissions and reduce the 
need for costly and inconvenient emissions testing programs such as those 
required of motorists in the Chicago area as well as California. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become so much more compelling now than three weeks ago," said 
Stedman, referring to the recent spiraling cost of fuel. A car in need of a 
tune-up not only pollutes the air but also uses more gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Stedman's contraption, known as Fuel Efficiency Automobile Test, or FEAT, beams 
an infrared light at tailpipe level across the ramp. A sensor on the opposite 
side of the ramp reads carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions of vehicles 
that break the beam. Simultaneously, a video camera records license plate 
numbers and matches them with the readings. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the license data would be used to track down owners of any cars 
found to be in violation of federal emission standards. They could be ticketed 
or ordered to come to a center for further testing. 
</P>
<P>
Previous research with the equipment led Stedman to conclude that a minority of 
cars causes the majority of auto-related pollution. He said that about 70% of 
vehicles seem to run clean enough to meet government guidelines, 28% sometimes 
exceed pollution limits and the rest are always in violation when the motor is 
running. 
</P>
<P>
In total, about half of all toxic carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles in the 
Chicago area can be linked to a scant 8% of those on the road, according to his 
research. Pinpoint the small number of bad guys and you've gone a long way 
toward solving the car pollution problem, his methodology suggests. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely the result that the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural 
Resources hopes can come out of Stedman's research, which the agency is 
spending $50,000 to fund. 
</P>
<P>
At present, all cars in Northern Illinois must be tested annually at state 
drive-in facilities. Stedman and his supporters question the value of such 
tests because they are done when cars are idling in neutral and don't 
necessarily reflect how they operate under highway conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a split second in time, but it is real time," Stedman said of his 
curbside testing device. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Denham, research economist for the Illinois clean air agency, said random 
exhaust monitoring with FEAT could be far more effective than the present 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the (on-site) test and the car goes out of tune a day later, the 
(clean air agency) won't know it for a year," Denham said. " . . . This gives 
us the opportunity to test the car once a day, once a week or once a month." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the current inspection program -- $23 million a year and rising -- 
could be halved, according to Denham's crude calculations. More important, it 
could bring Illinois' air quality in compliance with EPA standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Illinois officials see promise in FEAT, not everyone is sold on its 
value, including officials in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the test is done with some controlled circumstances, the results are 
fallible," said William Sessa, spokesman for the California Air Resources 
Board. He cited such variables as a cold car or a car accelerating or 
decelerating as potentially skewing on-road test results. Last year, the 
California Air Resources Board used Stedman's device to screen cars for carbon 
monoxide research, but the test was done under fixed, not random, conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Stedman suggests that his California critics might be motivated by 
reasons other than science. "They made a political investment in the program 
they set up. They said it works. I'm saying it doesn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He does concede that smog and emission control programs like the one now in use 
in California were considered state of the art when they were implemented a few 
years ago. Even his own device could be "antiquated in five years," Stedman 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken it to the development of the microscope," said Marc Pitchford, an 
atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Protection Agency's Monitoring 
Systems Laboratory in Las Vegas, who helped Stedman get federal funding three 
years ago to build his pollution detector. "It doesn't cure the disease 
directly, but it gives us a lot of information to help cure the disease." 
</P>
<P>
If Stedman's research pans out, officials here say, cars zooming along ramps of 
the Eisenhower or other expressways could be making recurring appearances on 
the pollution watching "candid camera" in as little as five years.

Airline deregulation achieved the intended effect of getting more people to 
fly, but it also created a nettlesome side product: overcrowding on the ground 
and congestion in the air. 
</P>
<P>
And the numbers just keep growing. According to figures compiled by the Air 
Transport Assn., 316 million passengers flew in 1979, the first year without 
heavy government regulation, compared with 454 million in 1989. Over the same 
period, the number of airplane departures soared from 5.4 million to 6.6 
million a year.

Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, the nation's newest airport, was built in 1974 and is 
one of 21 airports choking with 20,000-plus hours of annual flight delays. By 
the time proposed airports in Denver and Austin, Tex., are added to the 
nation's air transit system sometime during the middle of this decade, a dozen 
more airports will be gridlocked with the same level of congestion, according 
to projections by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED SOLUTION: The obvious answer is to build more airport terminals and 
gates. But that's easier said than done. Local communities can't afford 
expensive capital projects; federal assistance for airport construction is a 
long-gone luxury. In addition, anti-noise community groups often pose 
formidable political opposition to construction proposals. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of airport operators, the Bush Administration -- via 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner -- has another idea. The suggestion: 
change federal laws prohibiting local airport authorities from charging 
passengers additional fees for using their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under proposed legislation, airport authorities could seek permission from the 
transportation secretary to charge departing passengers a fee of $1, $2 or $3. 
These so-called Passenger Facility Charges -- or PFCs -- would be collected by 
the airlines and passed along to airport officials. The money generated could 
be used only for specific and pre-approved projects such as constructing new 
gates or, perhaps, a new airport as envisioned by officials in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would require the Administration to spend down the Airport 
Trust Fund, primarily to benefit small airports that would not be allowed to 
impose the user fees on passengers. The trust fund has a $7.6-billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
OUTRAGED OPPOSITION: Critics complain that PFCs are attractive only because 
they are hidden taxes. Among the most vocal opponents has been Rep. Norman Y. 
Mineta (D-San Jose), who considers the legislation a "needless tax, which is 
unfair to the traveling public." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some resistance, a PFC bill passed the House last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is about to take up the issue. Two key senators -- Commerce Chairman 
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) and aviation subcommittee Chairman Wendell H. Ford 
(D-Ky.) -- are on record opposing PFCs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: But even if the fees are implemented, limited airport capacity is 
likely to remain for the foreseeable future, according to a pair of General 
Accounting Office reports that supported the PFC legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, in fact, found that many of the problems associated with expansion 
stemmed from agreements between airport authorities and carriers that gave 
carriers control over many decisions. For example, carriers may have exclusive 
rights to certain gates, and airport authorities may have to ask their 
permission to increase their fees for airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO pointed out that by creating independent funds, "a PFC could help shift 
more control over airport development, expansion and use decisions to 
airports." 
</P>
<P>
But that is still no guarantee that the PFCs would trigger new airport 
construction projects. Other factors, such as airport noise and airline 
marketing practices, inhibit airport expansion projects. Or stated another way, 
in the words of the GAO, "A PFC is not a panacea, as a lack of adequate funding 
is not the only problem faced by airports trying to expand capacity."

DESERT SHIELD GETS LOW PRIORITY IN BONN

<P>
Faced with staggering bills for German reunification and the need to 
financially prod along the Soviet military withdrawal, America's richest ally 
has done little to aid the U.S. action in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Backing up Operation Desert Shield, the American effort to counter Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, has been a low priority in West 
Germany, and its allies have begun to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Only Britain and France have made significant contributions of military forces 
to the U.S.-led buildup in Saudi Arabia, but even the smaller countries of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, like Portugal, have managed to make a 
bigger commitment to the effort than West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn officials contend that the cost of merging with East Germany, a process to 
be culminated in formal reunification ceremonies Oct. 3, could cost them as 
much as 100 billion marks ($64 billion) and that the West German constitution 
prohibits participation in military action on foreign soil. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a sense among Western military officials that West Germany is 
simply not pulling its share of the load. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO supreme commander in Europe, Gen. John Galvin, is quoted in this 
week's issue of Der Spiegel magazine as saying that Bonn could do more to 
support the Middle East operation. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Die Welt said Monday that the federal government's 
standard reflex to danger is "to stand back and leave the action to others, and 
to cloak itself politically in the peaceful virtue of the necessity to be 
weak." 
</P>
<P>
West German politicians have frequently cited the constitution as justification 
for declining to take part in international peacekeeping actions. The 
restriction forbids the Bundeswehr to take part in aggressive action abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself alluded to Bonn's awkward position among its 
NATO allies in a weekend radio interview when he called for revision of the 
constitution -- after Dec. 2 elections -- to allow military participation in 
U.N. peacekeeping efforts. 
</P>
<P>
NATO allies have developed the view that West Germany prefers to shirk defense 
duties abroad, Kohl said, adding: "This reflects neither the moral stature of 
our republic nor, I believe, our own conception of international solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III appealed to NATO foreign ministers in 
Brussels for more support in the Mideast effort. The alliance's secretary 
general, West German Gen. Manfred Woerner, told reporters "there is a feeling 
that the allies can and should do more." 
</P>
<P>
Bonn government sources disclosed Monday that up to 500 million marks ($320 
million) might soon be made available to help countries like Turkey, Jordan and 
Egypt that have suffered financially because of the international embargo 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 100 million marks ($64 million) would be earmarked for support of 
U.S. troops massed in Saudi Arabia, the sources said. The U.S. military action 
is costing Washington about $1 billion a month. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled government of Kuwait have 
pledged $12 billion this year to the military effort. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany so far has contributed only technical assistance to the operation, 
such as lending the U.S. Army 10 specially equipped vehicles for detecting 
contaminants resulting from the use of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain and France have deployed dozens of sophisticated 
surveillance and fighter aircraft and thousands of troops. NATO allies Spain, 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Portugal and Italy have agreed to 
send ships or provide transport for U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn has committed 12 billion marks ($7.7 billion) to aid the Soviet Union in 
its withdrawal of 370,000 troops from East Germany by 1994. Moscow insisted on 
the money to finance the move and the retraining of the displaced soldiers, 
plus the construction of new housing for them.

Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato criticized Japan on Monday as "greedy" and "repugnant" 
for not sending more money or troops to the Persian Gulf to join American 
forces against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"They are acting totally within the character that they usually do," D'Amato, a 
New York Republican, said of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"They are motivated by profit, greed and avarice. For them not to step forward 
and make a substantial financial contribution to this mission is 
unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs is an attitude that I think really is repugnant," D'Amato said of the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Japanese Consulate in Washington said their country has 
pledged $1 billion in aid, mostly through transporting equipment to Saudi 
Arabia. They also said Japan stands ready with further economic help to Egypt, 
Jordan and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of criticizing other countries, it is more important to strengthen our 
cooperation, and Japan is prepared to cooperate further with the United 
States," said spokesman Noriyuki Shikata.

HELMS PUTS STAMP ON TROOP BILL

The Senate voted Monday to give free mailing privileges to U.S. troops in Saudi 
Arabia, but only after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) edged out plans by Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) to sponsor the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston had announced in a press release that he planned to offer such a 
measure today, after returning from a trip to the Middle East and a stopover in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he had been asked by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of 
U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, for "help in getting this morale boost for his 
troops." 
</P>
<P>
But Helms, who also was on the trip with Cranston, beat the Californian to the 
punch in a classic display of congressional one-upmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Helms offered his free-mail amendment to the Postal Service appropriations bill 
shortly after Cranston's press release went out. He said that he had talked to 
Schwarzkopf's superior, President Bush, about the matter "and he wants to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
While he had found morale "very high," Helms said, the troops repeatedly 
complained that "they could not get stamps and, if by some chance some stamps 
came their way, they were soon stuck together by the humidity and the sweat." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed on a voice vote, still must be approved by the House. It would 
grant troops the privilege that soldiers in the Vietnam War had: simply writing 
their name in the corner of the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same free mailing privilege -- called the frank -- that members of 
Congress enjoy.

Arab labor organizers reported Monday that thousands of Palestinians have been 
deported from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states but urged them to try 
to return to their jobs because little work is available in the 
Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The General Federation of Trade Unions in the territories estimated that 56,675 
Palestinians have been deported from Saudi Arabia and the gulf region since the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference in East Jerusalem, leaders of the Palestinian labor 
organization said they are concerned about the return of Palestinians to the 
territories because few jobs are available to them. They called on wealthy 
Palestinians to help finance projects in the territories in order to provide 
more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Federation members estimate unemployment in the territories at roughly 30% and 
claim the high rate is in part a result of Soviet Jewish immigration. 
</P>
<P>
They estimated that 8,000 Palestinians have returned to the territories while 
another 80,000 remain stranded in Jordan.

Pope John Paul II on Monday blessed a huge multimillion-dollar basilica praised 
by some as a glorious gift to God and derided by others as a scandalous show of 
opulence. 
</P>
<P>
The consecration of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace highlighted the last leg 
of the Pope's 10-day tour of four African nations. 
</P>
<P>
Tight security was in place around this city of 70,000, the home of President 
Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to prevent anti-government demonstrations by recently 
legalized opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled the country as a one-party state since 
independence from France in 1960, offered the basilica as a gift to the Pope 
during a private audience at the Vatican last year. 
</P>
<P>
The colossal church, rising out of a former cocoa plantation, bears a striking 
resemblance to St. Peter's in Rome with its imposing dome and long arms of 
marble columns surrounding a plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, Pierre Fakhoury, has described the new basilica as the biggest 
church in Christendom. Vatican officials, however, said they believe St. 
Peter's is larger. 
</P>
<P>
The hardwood pews were packed with 7,000 people. In the plaza outside, tens of 
thousands of pilgrims followed the service on television monitors and 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the basilica, which was completed last year, has been a source of 
controversy in this once-prosperous West African nation now suffering its worst 
economic crisis in 30 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
President Houphouet-Boigny, who offered the basilica as a gift to the Vatican, 
says it cost $140 million, was built on his own land and was paid for with his 
family's money. 
</P>
<P>
But published reports have said the price tag could be as high as $300 million, 
and the president's opponents accused him of misappropriating state money for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cost, critics have said the money would be better spent on 
education and health care for the poor.

DEFICIT: DEMOCRATS ARE PREPARING A NEW PROPOSAL. THE DISAGREEMENTS ON TAXES, 
DOMESTIC SPENDING AND DEFENSE ARE STILL WIDE.

<P>
Despite failure to reach a budget agreement by their self-imposed Monday 
deadline, negotiators continued to labor in search of a compromise to reduce 
the federal deficit and avoid harsh automatic spending cuts scheduled to go 
into effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats prepared to offer a new proposal Monday night that Republican 
officials said they hoped would contain significant concessions designed to 
narrow the wide gap between the two sides on taxes, domestic spending and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a slow process," conceded House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), "but 
I'm confident we'll get an agreement . . . . Obviously, there was a hope we 
would make more (progress) by this time, but we're going to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) 
announced to reporters covering the closed negotiations that there would be no 
additional briefings and urged reporters to leave Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
In a long weekend of talks, Democrats and Republicans exchanged three offers on 
ways to cut the deficit for fiscal 1991 by roughly $50 billion and save $500 
billion over the next five years, aides said, but the plans changed little from 
the original proposals presented on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the talks are going nowhere fast," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. 
Brady complained in an early morning television interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued that Democrats were not serious about closing the budget gap 
in their early proposals because they relied largely on higher taxes and 
Pentagon cuts even as they planned to increase domestic program spending by 
about $86 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats countered that Republicans want to provide lucrative benefits for the 
wealthy by lowering the capital gains rate on investment profits to 15% but 
that they are unwilling to tie such a move to a hike in income taxes for the 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
"Republicans want capital gains regardless of the windfall," said one 
Democratic aide, and "they clearly want to sock it to Medicare beneficiaries, 
civil service and military retirees." 
</P>
<P>
In the opening rounds, Democrats proposed raising the top income tax rate to 
35% from 28% for the wealthiest taxpayers, imposing a 10% tax on luxury goods, 
higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and a small broad-based energy tax combined 
with a 7-cents-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes. Also, they proposed an oil 
import fee to go into effect only when oil prices drop below $20 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes a revenue-losing proposal to allow people to withdraw funds 
from their individual retirement accounts for such purposes as college 
education or buying a first home. 
</P>
<P>
The total package, including about $9 billion expected from beefing up efforts 
to collect bad debts, would increase revenues by about $215 billion over the 
next five years, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, by contrast, oppose any change in income tax rates and propose 
cutting capital gains taxes in expectation of a tax revenue windfall from 
greater turnover of investments. They suggested that most revenues should come 
from higher beer and wine taxes and from a $10,000 limit on the amount of state 
and local taxes that may be deducted on federal tax returns. Their plan would 
lose revenue by providing tax breaks to promote economic development in 
so-called enterprise zones and also by expanding IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican package, a GOP official said, would increase tax revenues by $99 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are willing to consider higher energy taxes, GOP aides said, and 
may support a more modest hike in luxury taxes than Democrats favor. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides shied away from any proposal to raise cigarette taxes, however, out 
of fear of tangling with tobacco-state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The official reason is that Bush has promised the governor of North Carolina 
that he would not tax tobacco," said one leading Democrat, "but the real reason 
is that (Sens.) Jesse Helms in North Carolina and Mitch McConnell in Kentucky 
hold two Republican seats (that are) in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
On spending, Democrats divided their plan into two parts, proposing certain 
cuts in domestic spending and benefit programs but suggesting higher spending 
in other areas to promote greater "equity." 
</P>
<P>
The net result, one Republican aide complained, would be a $40-billion increase 
in domestic spending over the next five years compared with the Democrats' 
latest plan to slash Pentagon spending by at least $245 billion over the same 
period. The GOP wants to limit military cuts to $120 billion over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans asked the Democrats to come up with $120 billion more (in 
domestic spending and benefit cuts) to get to a net (five-year) reduction of 
$80 billion that they believe is necessary," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats defended their plan to increase some domestic programs by pointing to 
Bush Administration proposals to spend more on space, science, criminal justice 
and foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Given the still-wide gulf between the two sides, several officials suggested 
that the talks are likely to return to Capitol Hill perhaps as early as today, 
where they might drag on even past the Oct. 1 date when Gramm-Rudman is 
supposed to trigger automatic spending cuts of more than $100 billion.

The free distribution of the promising AIDS drug DDC is being widened to 
include possibly thousands more patients, a drug company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Food and Drug Administration gave Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of 
Nutley, N.J., permission to provide dideoxycytidine, or DDC, to AIDS patients 
who cannot take the two currently available drugs to combat the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Those drugs are AZT, the only fully approved AIDS-fighting drug, and DDI, an 
experimental drug already offered through a similar expanded access program. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex have been receiving 
DDC through that route, and another 1,000 patients are taking the drug in the 
more strictly monitored tests required for government drug approval, said Paul 
Oestreicher, a Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the drug maker is dropping the requirement that a doctor must demonstrate 
that a patient cannot take DDI before being allowed to start DDC. That move 
will likely increase the number of patients in the expanded-access program. "It 
could potentially be thousands more," Oestreicher said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the most serious side effect of DDC has been pain in the nerves of the 
feet and hands. About 10% of patients eventually have to stop therapy because 
of side effects, Oestreicher said.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN DEATHS OF 2 TEEN CAMPERS CRUSHED BY AUTO

A 24-year-old Bellflower man arrested in connection with the weekend deaths of 
two teen-age campers at San Onofre State Park will be arraigned today on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving, felony hit and run and two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The license plate number on the vehicle the suspect left at the scene led 
police to arrest Douglas John Freels at his home about seven hours after the 
incident, which investigators believe occurred at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, Oceanside 
CHP Officer Jerry Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Freels was being held in the Vista Detention Facility on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Jacob Grubb, 18, of Laguna Niguel and his girlfriend, Amanda Jocon 
Ciskowski, 19, of San Diego, were crushed to death, apparently in their sleep, 
CHP officials said. Surfers discovered their bodies about half an hour after 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in Freels' car, identified by police as John Herrera of Downey, was 
questioned and released, Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also provided new details about how the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
They said the suspect was driving north at about 30 m.p.h. down the wrong side 
of old U.S. 101, six miles south of Basilone Road. The car veered off the 
narrow two-lane road and struck the tent where Grubb and Ciskowski were 
sleeping, police said. The tent was pitched next to the highway in a parking 
lot that closes at 10 p.m., said Steve Long, a lifeguard supervisor at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The driver allegedly ran over the couple, struck the rear of Grubb's vehicle 
and dragged the bodies under the rear wheels of his car for about 35 feet 
before coming to a stop, Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and his passenger then went to a pay telephone and called a cab to 
take them home, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the bodies) were still there when we arrived," Bohrer said, adding that 
Freels told officers that "he felt like he hit something, but didn't know what 
it was."

REV. KEYONG KIM; LED LARGEST KOREAN CHURCH IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Keyong Kim, retired senior pastor of Los Angeles' Young Nak 
Presbyterian Church, the largest Korean-American congregation in the United 
States, has died in North Korea where he was visiting his wife and children for 
the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Paul Yang, associate pastor at Young Nak, which recently moved into a new 
sanctuary near downtown Los Angeles, said Monday that the North Korean 
government had said in a telegram that his colleague died Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
Death was attributed to a heart attack, Yang said, adding that the church is 
pressuring North Korea to send Kim's body to Los Angeles for burial here. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who fled from North Korea to South Korea soon after the invasion of the 
south in 1950, had gone to his home city of Sineuijoo in Pyonganbukdo province 
to see his wife, Jin Sook, and four children. It was their first reunion since 
Kim had fled into South Korea and then to Brazil and the United States. He led 
Presbyterian congregations in all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Nak church had a congregation of only 100 when Kim came to Los 
Angeles from Denver in 1974. At his retirement last year the church had a 
membership of 6,000 and four Sunday services, three conducted in Korean and one 
in English. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation is among the fastest-growing in the country, Yang said.

INSURERS ASK 160% HIKE FOR RISKY DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new round of rate hearings for the state's assigned risk auto insurance 
system began Monday with insurance companies asking for a 160.5% average 
statewide increase and consumer groups questioning whether any increase is 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie, with the approval of the governor, 
reportedly had been set two weeks ago to order an interim assigned risk rate 
increase of 85%, but decided to delay her decision until the new hearings are 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's legal counsel, Karl Rubinstein, said Monday that the 160.5% request 
was excessive, but agreed that some increase is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The current average annual assigned risk rate for the minimum state-required 
liability insurance is $695. Under the proposed 160.5% increase, the rate would 
rise to $1,789; in some areas with high numbers of claims, such as the south 
and east sides of Los Angeles, it would exceed $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned risk is a system under which drivers supposedly unable to obtain 
coverage in the regular market are assigned to companies in proportion to each 
company's share of statewide auto business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1.23 million drivers enrolled in this system. But many, particularly 
in urban areas, chose assigned risk not because they could not get insurance in 
the regular market, but because it was cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of other drivers go uninsured, and Gillespie has expressed fear that 
if she agrees to the higher rates requested by insurers, many assigned risk 
drivers will become uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward not carrying auto insurance also could increase Jan. 1, when 
stringent enforcement of the state's mandatory auto insurance law is scheduled 
to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
After that date, unless the Legislature adopts an unexpected emergency 
extension, drivers stopped by police for speeding and other violations will no 
longer have their licenses suspended if they are unable to show proof of 
insurance. The only enforcement of the mandatory law will be to require drivers 
reporting accidents to submit proof of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
With present enforcement, the state Department of Motor Vehicles has estimated 
that 5 million California drivers, or 25% of the total, are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers said at Monday's hearing in San Francisco that they lost $630 million 
on assigned risk customers last year, losses they said were largely passed on 
in the form of higher premiums to regular customers. Actuary J. Robert Hunter, 
who is president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, testified for 
the consumer groups that such statistics are suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and others have charged that the real intent of the insurance companies 
is to see assigned risk rates go so high that risky drivers will opt out of the 
insurance system altogether. Then, insurers will not have to cover people 
perceived to be the worst risks. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's refusal last year to agree to a 112.3% assigned risk rate increase 
proposed by the insurers led to a lawsuit by the insurers against her that is 
still in the appeals courts. A Superior Court judge's order allowing the 
companies a 40% increase for assigned risk drivers with bad safety records has 
been held up while the appeals are heard. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of minority and low-income drivers have criticized Gillespie 
and the Deukmejian Administration for allegedly failing to honor promises to 
work hard for passage of legislation that would provide an affordable, 
no-frills policy. 
</P>
<P>
One such representative, Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland), appeared 
outside the hearing to assail the proposed assigned risk increases as "obscene 
and irresponsible."

RAILROAD ADMITS 2 ERRORS IN DERAILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. officials, quoting results of a preliminary 
investigation, Monday blamed company workers for failing to properly couple 14 
freight cars that rolled from a City of Industry switching yard and smashed 
into three locomotives stopped eight miles away in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific spokesman Andy Anderson said a switch in the City of Industry 
yard was "mistakenly" left open, allowing the string of freight cars to wander 
onto a Union Pacific line and into the path of the locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an error in coupling and they got loose," Anderson said of the 
freight cars, nine of which derailed in the collision. "The second mistake was 
that the switch on the Union Pacific line was opened." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson declined to say what, if any, penalties would be imposed on the 
workers, pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators from the state Public Utilities Commission, the 
National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration 
continued their probes of the Sunday morning crash that sent the nine cars 
hurtling into the back yards of at least seven Pico Rivera homes. 
</P>
<P>
No damage estimate has been made. Anderson said the company's liability would 
be determined by the amount of damages. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess we are talking about a couple hundred thousand dollars, mostly 
in railroad equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the 9:44 a.m. collision, which rattled several blocks 
near Whittier and Paramount boulevards. None of the cars were carrying volatile 
or hazardous materials. One freight car landed only inches from a kitchen where 
a woman was feeding her 3-month-old son. Another car, which was parked on an 
adjacent track, was knocked into a garage. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation by the Federal Railroad Administration appeared to 
concur with Anderson's explanation of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars probably broke free after they were improperly connected to a 
locomotive in the Industry train yard," said administration spokesman Steve 
Borows. "They rolled onto the Union Pacific line and that is what caused the 
mishap." 
</P>
<P>
Borows said that "if our investigation shows it was human error, the railroad 
can be cited for violating safety regulations and a monetary fine can be 
imposed." 
</P>
<P>
"If they find it was human error that borders on gross negligence or that it 
was a mishap based on gross misconduct, the fine can be substantial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Union Pacific officials praised "quick, smart thinking" on the part 
of dispatchers 1,100 miles away in Omaha, Neb., and their four-man locomotive 
crew in Pico Rivera, who, with minutes to spare, frantically searched for the 
safest place to park their 400-ton engines and absorb the impact. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trying to avoid adjoining buildings, bridges and highways -- and 
they only had 10 minutes to do it," said Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley, 
commenting on the time between detection of the runaway cars and impact. 
</P>
<P>
"They shaved it really thin," Bromley said. After the crew stopped the 
locomotives and set the brakes, "the men started running. They managed to run 
100 yards when the runaways hit their train." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, Union Pacific officials at the railroad's new $48-million 
electronic dispatch center had scotched a plan to switch the runaway cars onto 
a track that would have sent them careening across an Amtrak line at 60 miles 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very concerned about possibly hitting an Amtrak train," Bromley said. 
"So, we elected to take the hit ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that although Southern Pacific plans to install a special 
switching mechanism in the City of Industry yard that will automatically derail 
loose cars before they can roll onto a mainline, there is little the railroad 
can do to prepare for collisions involving runaway cars. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a pretty rare occurence," Anderson said. "We just have to police what 
our people do in the yards." 
</P>
<P>
Bromley agreed, saying, "We don't have a chance to practice this sort of 
scenario very often." 
</P>
<P>
"It is like an airline pilot -- you work for 20 years in boredom and eight 
seconds of sheer terror and hope that when that time comes everybody does the 
right thing," he said. "In this case, it looks like everybody did." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, railroad accidents are increasing across the state, according to 
federal statistics. In 1988, there were 109 train accidents, compared to 151 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in railroad accidents last year, which included the derailment of a 
runaway Southern Pacific freight train in west San Bernardino that resulted in 
four deaths, prompted the PUC to hire four additional safety inspectors to 
enforce state and federal railroad regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's railroad line through Pico Rivera was expected to be cleaned up 
and reopened late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids are pretty upset, every time they hear a train rumble by they are 
going to be afraid," said Theresa Marquez, 35, whose garage was heavily damaged 
by a freight car. "It's going to be like having an earthquake every time a 
train goes by."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INS ORDERED TO GIVE DATA ON MINORS IN 
JUVENILE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Monday to 
turn over data on the number of minors kept in INS custody at Eastlake Juvenile 
Hall in Lincoln Heights. U.S. Chief District Judge Manuel Real granted the 
information request from the National Center for Immigrants' Rights Inc. The 
group argued that underaged immigrants are subjected to violent abuse by 
juvenile criminals in places such as Eastlake, and that it would be 
inappropriate to keep minors there. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carlos Holguin of the center said the INS has held minors at Eastlake 
for up to four weeks, in violation of a court-approved agreement to keep 
juveniles there no longer than 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Ian Fan, who represented the INS, opposed release of the 
data, contending it violated the minors' right to privacy. He also said the INS 
has not violated the 72-hour agreement at Eastlake since last November.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WIFE OF EX-DEA AGENT PLEADS GUILTY ON TAX 
COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent, Barbara Jackson, 
pleaded guilty Monday in federal court in Los Angeles to failure to file her 
1987 income tax return as part of a plea-bargain agreement linked to the 
agency's corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 42, of Claremont is the wife of former DEA agent John Jackson, 41, who 
pleaded guilty last month to trafficking in drugs stolen from the agency's 
evidence vault in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Jackson, who faced eight counts in a federal grand jury indictment, 
entered the plea to a misdemeanor charge of failing to report approximately 
$28,000 in income for 1987. The maximum penalty is a $25,000 fine and one year 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
A second DEA agent, Wayne Countryman, 47, of Walnut has pleaded guilty to 
narcotics conspiracy and tax evasion charges. A third agent, Darnell Garcia, 
43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, who faces drug trafficking charges, is preparing 
for an Oct. 9 jury trial.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 STUDENTS WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS NEAR 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two students were shot and seriously wounded near school campuses Monday in 
separate incidents that police described as gang related. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Yepiz, 15, of Sun Valley, was shot in the back as he, his brother and 
mother left the parking lot of John H. Francis Polytechnical High School in Sun 
Valley, where the two boys had registered for class. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Yepiz was hospitalized in critical, but stable condition after he 
was stuck at least once by bullets fired from a passing van. No arrests had 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
In the second shooting, a 16-year-old student was shot Monday while standing 
across from the Belmont High School campus at 1275 W. 2nd St., west of downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Several boys went over to talk to occupants of a car that had driven up when a 
passenger in the back seat pulled a gun and began firing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District police chased the car and arrested two 
minors and a 20-year-old man who was not identified. Officers also recovered a 
.22 caliber pistol. The three were booked for investigation of attempted 
murder.

NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The questions that mattered most as Monday night's game began concerned the San 
Francisco team and the New Orleans quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Can the 49ers hold the peak they reached last year? 
</P>
<P>
Is Saint John Fourcade a sandlot player or an NFL quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
On a night when Fourcade played mostly sandlot football, there was never a time 
when the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers resembled last year's team -- 
until the last minute and a half. At that late hour San Francisco quarterback 
Joe Montana won it as usual, this time with a brisk 60-yard field-goal march. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's fourth completion in five attempts on that drive shook up the Saints 
and set up the 49er kicker, Mike Cofer, for the 38-yard field goal that 
overcame the plucky New Orleans defense at last, 13-12, with nine seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity Louisiana Superdome crowd of 68,629 saw only one touchdown all 
evening, that one scored on a short Montana pass in the second half before 
Morten Andersen kicked his fourth field goal for a 12-10 New Orleans lead that 
didn't quite stand up. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, (Montana) got it done," San Francisco Coach George Seifert said. 
"Either team could have won it at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Said New Orleans Coach Jim Mora: "If we had gotten a couple of first downs 
toward the end, we would have won the football game." 
</P>
<P>
He was right about that. The Saints didn't make a first down in four series 
after Andersen's fourth field goal. 
</P>
<P>
More surprisingly, Montana, in five chances to overtake the Saints in the 
fourth quarter, couldn't make a first down, either, until that last drive. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game that introduced the 49ers in their 1990 bid for an unprecedented 
fifth Super Bowl championship, but this isn't the same team that won the last 
two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Most glaringly, 49er receivers could seldom find their way into a clearing. 
Through the '80s, these receivers had been famous for the distances they put 
between themselves and defensive backs, but those days are over, or so it 
seemed in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans secondary was ready for the familiar 49er pass patterns, and 
with wide receivers Jerry Rice and John Taylor usually too closely guarded to 
throw to, Montana held the ball a fraction longer than he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the New Orleans defensive line and linebackers gave him a bad 
night -- or more exactly, almost 59 minutes of a bad night. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans, in fact, was really the better team -- except at one position, 
Fourcade's. With a sharp, experienced quarterback, the Saints would have won 
this one by several touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
And Fourcade did attack the 49ers with occasional brilliance. It was easy to 
see why eight or nine teams in seven or eight leagues, including the indoor 
Arena League, have been keeping him around for the last 10 years or so. At 
medium range, with a receiver in the open, Fourcade usually drilled the ball 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final reckoning, he lost the game with the two poorly thrown passes 
he delivered on the 49er goal line to intercepting 49ers in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints had San Francisco on the ropes in that quarter. They first sacked 
Montana into a fumble at the 49er 11-yard line, and soon thereafter they were 
back at the 49er 18 on Fourcade's well-thrown pass to wide receiver Floyd 
Turner for a net gain of 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But both times, Fourcade threw it away, as, successively, cornerback Darryl 
Pollard and safety Ronnie Lott intercepted for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade went the distance for New Orleans, in part because the club's veteran, 
Bobby Hebert, is still holding out. But Hebert had lost his job last December, 
when Fourcade went on a three-game winning streak that only ended when the 
champions came back to town Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The champions, at the end, won it characteristically. Taking possession at his 
19-yard line with 1:30 left, Montana earned his first first down since throwing 
a four-yard scoring pass to tight end Brent Jones early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He earned it on a pass to Taylor for 25 yards. Then in rapid order, he threw to 
fullback Tom Rathman for four yards, threw one away, threw to fullback Roger 
Craig for 11 yards, and threw to Rice for 20. 
</P>
<P>
His last throwaway used up four seconds as Cofer trotted in to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Montana) is like Houdini," New Orleans safety Gene Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rathman: "Give Montana a minute at the end, it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
But after being sacked on six plays, roughed up on other plays, outgained as a 
passer by two yards by Fourcade, of all people, Montana said: "I didn't play 
worth a damn." 
</P>
<P>
More exactly, he was a victim of a revamped, improving New Orleans defense that 
has four of the best linebackers on the planet -- from left to right, Rickey 
Jackson, Sam Mills, Vaughan Johnson and Pat Swilling -- plus a pass rusher, for 
a change: top draft choice Renaldo Turnbull. 
</P>
<P>
When Atkins, Toi Cook and the others in the Saints' secondary took Rice and 
Taylor virtually out of the game, Montana was worked over by the tough guys in 
the New Orleans front seven. 
</P>
<P>
The only touchdown drive that Montana could sustain needed two big penalties 
and a marvelously executed Montana touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
On third and three at the New Orleans four-yard line, facing a 3-8 defense with 
eight Saints in the secondary, Montana rolled out far to his right and read 
back across the end zone from one sideline to the other. Only one 49er was 
open, the one on Montana's far left, Jones. And he found him.

SEEING REDS DOESN'T PAY FOR DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: WITH A WEEKEND SERIES AT CINCINNATI AHEAD, LOS ANGELES OVERLOOKS THE 
PADRES AND LOSES, 5-2.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were only 11,729 in the stands Monday night, their opponents were the 
fourth-place San Diego Padres, there was no pennant-race atmosphere and there 
were no red uniforms for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the proper guests, the Dodgers fell to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Missing a chance to gain ground on the idle Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers blew a 
2-1 lead with a horrid seventh inning en route to a 5-2 loss to the Padres in 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a poor performance by reliever Tim Crews, mixed with a shaky defense, 
the Dodgers fell to six games behind the National League West-leading Reds with 
21 remaining. They still have three games at Cincinnati this weekend, but if 
they aren't more careful these next two nights in San Diego, those games could 
come too late. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to think about the actual game we are playing and not think about the 
scoreboard or the games remaining or anything like that," said Juan Samuel, 
whose first two-homer game in more than three years provided all of the 
Dodgers' offense. "Time is the main thing right now." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel's bat was needed considering the Dodgers played without Kirk Gibson and 
Kal Daniels. Gibson was nursing a bruised right forearm and Daniels was 
suffering from a sore lower back. 
</P>
<P>
In committing three errors, giving them 14 in the last eight games, the Dodgers 
were shaky even before the Padres' winning seventh inning. Mike Morgan allowed 
no earned runs in six innings, but the Padres had scored once on third baseman 
Mike Sharperson's throwing error and Morgan had walked four and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the seventh, the Padres had stranded 11 batters and were frustrated. 
Then Tim Crews replaced Morgan, and that frustration ended. 
</P>
<P>
Against Crews, who entered with a 13 2/3-inning scoreless streak, Jack Clark 
began the inning with a walk. Joe Carter's grounder forced Clark at second, but 
Carter wound up on third base a couple of pitches later after he stole second 
and kept running when catcher Rick Dempsey threw the ball into center field. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago walked, then Lynn singled to center to score Carter and move 
Santiago to second. Garry Templeton singled to left to load the bases for 
pitcher Dennis Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Stephenson batted for Rasmussen and could only manage a grounder to second 
baseman Samuel. But Samuel and shortstop Alfredo Griffin could not turn the 
double play. Stephenson was safe and Santiago had scored with the eventual 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres added two in the eighth against rookie Darren Holmes, who kept up 
the bullpen's bad streak by allowed first hitter Paul Faries to reach first on 
a strikeout, because of a wild pitch. Gwynn doubled to right and Faries scored 
on Hubie Brooks' throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
A grounder and an intentional walk later, Santiago's fly ball scored the final 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"We had them beat," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "When two runs is all you get, 
you have to make the pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody asked if the Dodgers also needed a tighter defense. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw what happened out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had taken a 2-0 lead after four innings on two big swings from 
Samuel -- each resulting in a home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel had not hit a homer since July 24. During that time, before Monday, 
Samuel had 18 hits in 89 at-bats for a .202 average that lowered his overall 
average to .213. 
</P>
<P>
He had only eight homers and 36 runs batted, and only two two-homer games in 
his eight-year career, the most recent on July 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel also entered the night with a .154 career average against Rasmussen, who 
gave up two runs on six hits in seven innings to improve to 10-13. Crews fell 
to 2-5. Morgan has won once since July 30, a span of nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
"But they don't mean anything," Samuel said of the homers. "You don't win, they 
mean nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres actually didn't deserve this much more than the Dodgers. They 
stranded 11 baserunners in the first six innings with abysmal at-bats. While 
much of the credit must go to Morgan, some of the blame belongs to a sluggish 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, with runners on second and third and one out, Clark popped 
to third base and Carter grounded to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, with runners on second and third and two out, Bip Roberts 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, with runners on first and second and two out, Rasmussen, batting 
.288, struck out. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth inning was the worst Padre inning, as five men reached base but only 
one scored. The inning featured Roberts, who led off with a double, being 
thrown out attempting to steal third after he stopped running on a hit-and-run 
before continuing to third base after batter Clark missed the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored their first run in that inning, after the bases were loaded 
on two walks by Morgan and a throwing error by Sharperson. Santiago hit a 
grounder in the hole that glanced off Griffin's glove as he attempted a 
backhand stab. The grounder was ruled a hit, and Gwynn scored from third to 
make the score 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Kirk Gibson's lower right arm showed no break. The deep bruise will 
be evaluated daily. Gibson was injured Sunday when he was hit by a pitch from 
Cincinnati's Danny Jackson in the fifth inning. . . . Kal Daniels told trainers 
he probably aggravated his lower back while attempting a diving catch in the 
fifth inning Sunday. He went five for 22 during the home stand to lower his 
average to .283, although he has five home runs in his last 25 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
When Jose Gonzalez was told he was making only his 13th start of the year in 
place of Daniels, he was reminded of Manager Tom Lasorda's comments that he 
started Juan Samuel last weekend because Lasorda had a dream. "To start me, 
Tommy must have had a bad dream," Gonzalez said. . . . Orel Hershiser had his 
best rehabilitation day, making 75 tosses at up to 100 feet. Hershiser repeated 
that he would not throw batting practice before the end of the season, but said 
there was a chance he would throw off a mound. "Everything keeps going good, no 
setbacks yet," Hershiser said.

NOW A U.S. OPEN CHAMPION, SAMPRAS ASPIRES TO CONTINUE ON IN THE STYLE OF LAVER 
AND ROSEWALL 
</P>

<P>
Pete Sampras got out of bed Monday morning and his right arm hurt, but not 
because he had slept on it wrong. When Sampras got up, he hadn't slept at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get any sleep because it's still unreal," Sampras said. "I don't 
believe it still." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras' right arm was bound to be sore -- but "a good sore," he said -- after 
the way he had used it Sunday in defeating Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, to 
become the youngest men's singles champion in the U.S. Open's 110-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Only 28 days past his 19th birthday, Sampras blew 13 aces past Agassi and 
totaled an even 100 in the seven matches he won, a number that further tested 
his credulity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that either," said Sampras, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after for Sampras began when he made the rounds of the three 
networks' early morning shows to be interviewed live. He taped an interview for 
an evening network news show, then taped an appearance on Joan Rivers' talk 
show, where he shared billing with a new contest in which viewers can win free 
plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was back to the hotel, pack and get to the airport for a flight 
to Amelia Island, Fla., and two days of playing golf undisturbed. Or so Sampras 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to take the next couple of days and let it sink in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It may take a while for others, too, especially Agassi, who lost his second 
Grand Slam final this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can play that kind of tennis, he'll beat everybody," Agassi said. "The 
way he played, he should come back to Vegas with me and we'll go to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) who's to say if it was just a good tournament or he's really up there," 
Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sampras: "Obviously there's going to be a lot more pressure on me, (but) 
at age 19 I think I can handle that responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds, Sampras grew up idolizing Australian 
tennis great Rod Laver, although he never saw him play in person or on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sampras spent hours viewing 16-millimeter film of Laver playing in the 
World Championship of Tennis events in Dallas in 1971 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Watching with Sampras were the man who owned the tapes, Del Little, Sampras' 
footwork coach at the time, and Sampras' former coach, Dr. Pete Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always looked up to the older guys like Laver and (Ken) Rosewall," 
Sampras said. "I really enjoyed that era. I think that a lot of guys, 
especially my age, forget the Lavers and Rosewalls. All those were class 
individuals, and I would like to be in that category." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Agassi does not feel such a strong tug from his sport's past. When 
Agassi accepted his French Open runner-up award at Roland Garros, he was told 
he had just stood next to septuagenarian Jean Borotra, one of France's famed 
Three Musketeers of the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know . . . he was just some old guy," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who parted with Sampras a year ago, knew the secret of his 
14-year-old's success lay in the old movies of Laver. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer told the New York Times that he felt it vital for Sampras to learn to 
play tennis correctly and not just how to win matches. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched Laver more than anyone," Fischer said. "Laver had that kind of 
smooth motion. A round motion where the shoulders are moving and the hips are 
moving and everything was going up together and coming down and exploding. 
</P>
<P>
"Laver had to explode to get the power he did, and Pete certainly explodes," 
Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Fischer, a pediatrician working at the Kaiser Foundation in Bellflower, 
who changed Sampras' style into the powerful force that enabled him to win his 
first Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer adapted Sampras' backhand from a two-handed ground stroke to one and 
also steered him into a serve-and-volley game instead of letting him 
counterpunch from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
The new game brought stirring changes in Sampras, but it took a while. Sampras 
said his calm on-court demeanor -- John McEnroe called him cool as a cucumber 
-- is an indirect effect of the serve-and-volley style. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know why I'm so laid back, (but) I think it's because of the 
style of my game . . . very fluid and very easy to do," Sampras said. "Ever 
since I changed my game, I'm just much more relaxed on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get too up-tight or anything. I'm just a normal 19-year-old growing up 
with a very unusual job and doing very unusual things." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras said he battled Fischer over the new style. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a point when I was a junior where I wasn't really improving as a 
tennis player," Sampras said. "I had a weak serve, and I really couldn't volley 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I did poorly at a junior tournament. I got back and I had three months off, 
and Pete Fischer suggested that I switch to a one-handed backhand. I was 
completely against it from the first. And even after six months, I didn't want 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I stuck with it, and I made the Junior Davis Cup squad. A year later, I 
beat (Michael) Chang at the Junior (U.S.) Open, and the more I played, the more 
I won, the more confidence I have. I probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for 
that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Where he is, of course, is in the U.S. Open record books and walking -- slowly, 
coolly -- to the first tee.

AT 39, KINGS' ROBINSON GIVES IT ANOTHER RIDE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: DEFENSEMAN DOESN'T WANT TO END CAREER WITH MEMORIES OF LAST SEASON'S 
FRUSTRATION.

<P>
As the days of summer dwindled to a few, Larry Robinson, veteran of 18 NHL 
seasons, grew eager to play. 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't wait to get back to hockey? 
</P>
<P>
Uh, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe polo? 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Robinson was weighing the agony of his most frustrating year in hockey, 
against the ecstasy of his best year in polo. 
</P>
<P>
And thinking what once seemed unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asking myself a lot during the summer, 'Should I hang it up now, or 
shouldn't I?' " Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Problem is, I've still got to pay for those ponies." 
</P>
<P>
Good point. Polo is still just a hobby for Robinson, one that costs him 
$15,000-$20,000 a year. Hockey, on the other hand, is his high-paying 
occupation. Robinson is in the second season of a three-year, $1.65-million 
deal with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the only reason he finally decided to put down his mallet, pick 
up his hockey stick and join his teammates here in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
He also didn't want to skate away from the game with last season his final 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
In his 17 years with the Montreal Canadians, Robinson became one of the top 
defensemen in NHL history. A two-time winner of the Norris Trophy, given to the 
league's best defenseman, holder of the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 
1978, and a six-time all-star, Robinson played on six Stanley Cup champions in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
But at times last season, one might have thought he had never even played in 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to impress in his first year in Los Angeles, Robinson wound up pressing. 
He tried to do more than his 38-year-old legs would permit in a division much 
faster than he was accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
He committed a rash of turnovers, several times in crucial situations. 
</P>
<P>
There were whispers that he had left his game in Montreal, that he was going to 
quit, that he should quit. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence disappeared. He acknowledged that he reached the point where his 
only desire was to get off the ice before the other team scored, hardly a great 
frame of mind for a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was my own worst enemy," Robinson said. "Maybe I panicked a little 
bit and tried to do too much. As a result, everybody suffered. This is still a 
team sport. You just can't go out there and expect to carry it all on your 
shoulders. Even Wayne (Gretzky) can't expect to go out and carry this team on 
his shoulders. You just don't win hockey games like that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's problems weren't eased by his having to adjust to a new environment 
after 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Having never played on another club, I didn't know about the pressure of 
changing cities and having your family change," Robinson said. "I think 
everything built up and hit all at once. 
</P>
<P>
"You're playing in a different system with different guys. In this game, when 
you make a decision, it has to be made so quickly. But these aren't the same 
people you're used to playing with. They don't do the same things. So that 
fraction of a second wasn't there. When I got myself into a jam, I had to think 
my way out of it. As soon as you start that, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't too late for Robinson, thanks to an old opponent. 
</P>
<P>
When Robinson scored his first NHL goal 17 years ago, it was against a King 
goalie named Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon is now the team's general manager. It was he who had signed Robinson to 
a King contract, and it was he who pulled him aside last February for a pep 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon's message was all the more effective because it was rooted in personal 
experience. Vachon, too, had been an NHL star, playing in goal for 16 years. 
But he also wound up losing the mind game. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was similar to Robinson's. After a seven-year, all-star career 
with the Kings, Vachon left to sign a lucrative deal with the Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start making big money, compared to what you made before, you feel 
like you have to do more," Vachon said. "And that's where you start getting 
yourself in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"You start putting pressure on yourself. You're so tight, you can't handle the 
puck. When you think like this, you just can't perform. When things are going 
well, you say, 'Come on. Give me the puck. I'll stop everything.' But, if 
you're not confident, you'll say, 'Geez, I hope my defense can put a stick in 
front of that puck.' Big change. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through that. I tried self-hypnosis. I tried all kinds of stuff. It was 
unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing worked for Vachon until, after two frustrating seasons, he finally 
asked to be traded. The Red Wings granted his wish, sending him to the Boston 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started to relax a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that story, Robinson relaxed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, things got worse before they got better. Robinson's mental slump was 
compounded by physical problems. Food poisoning weakened him late in the 
regular season, and he also suffered a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the playoffs, with Tom Laidlaw sidelined because of an injury and 
several other defensemen hurting, Robinson skated to the forefront, displaying 
leadership and playing with the confidence and skill Vachon had envisioned when 
he signed him. 
</P>
<P>
And that has given Vachon confidence that Robinson still has something left at 
39, that he can make a big contribution in the wake of injuries to fellow 
defensemen Laidlaw and Bob Halkidis. 
</P>
<P>
"He did well in the playoffs, so obviously he can do it," Vachon said. "Now, 
it's just a matter of playing his game and not worrying about the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"He can still skate. He can still handle the puck. Physically, he's fit." 
</P>
<P>
Despite some nagging doubts during the summer, Robinson says he is mentally fit 
as well, especially upon hearing that Coach Tom Webster plans on stressing a 
more conservative, defense-minded, patient style of play. 
</P>
<P>
No more freewheeling shootouts, a trademark of King teams over the years. The 
days of giving up five goals and hoping they can get six are out, according to 
Webster. He says he would rather be boring and successful. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said: "L.A. teams of the past have tried to outscore other teams, and 
you just can't do that in this day and age. You certainly have to be able to 
score goals, but you have to be able to stop them as well. 
</P>
<P>
"(The new style) is not going to be the most exciting on most nights, but any 
time you've got Luc Robitaille, Todd Elik, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Granato and the 
like, you're still going to get entertaining hockey. But, the only way you're 
going to keep people happy in the long run is to put a winning club out there. 
We used say all the time in Montreal, 'We bored them again and won another 
one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he is excited about the hockey season ahead, Robinson still feels a 
tug from the season he left behind. His polo team won the Mid-America League 
title and has qualified for the prestigious President's Cup tournament for the 
amateur championship of North America. But the team may have to forfeit in 
Robinson's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Play starts this week and a substitute still hasn't been found for Robinson on 
the four-man squad. Robinson asked the Kings if he could take the week off from 
hockey but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about it with reporters at Robert Guertin Arena where the Kings are 
training, Robinson shook his head in regret. But then he excused himself to get 
back on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Polo will have to wait. He isn't quite ready just yet to ride off into the 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team is disappointed in rookie defenseman Paul Holden. He has, according to 
Rogie Vachon, arrived overweight and out of shape. "He is not going to make the 
team this way," Vachon said. "Now we have openings (with injuries to Tom 
Laidlaw and Bob Halkidis) like it or not, and (Holden) had a great chance. He's 
looked sluggish. Sure, he can change, but he'd better do it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Rumor of the week: Left wing Luc Robitaille, whose name has been linked to 
trade rumors involving half a dozen teams, was reported by a Montreal radio 
station Sunday to be heading to the Canadiens, along with defenseman Steve 
Duchesne, for goalie Brian Hayward, center Andrew Cassels, wing Shayne Corson 
and defenseman Petr Svoboda. As usual, the Kings laughed off the rumor. "Luc 
has been mentioned in so many trades that if the time should ever come when we 
have to tell him he's been traded, he won't believe us," Vachon said.

SCHROEDER GETS A PASSING MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI and CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does an offensive line that did not allow a sack of Jay Schroeder in five 
exhibition games allow Schroeder to get dumped five times against a wounded, 
three-man Denver pass rush? Merely a case of bad technique, Coach Art Shell 
said. . 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're going to get better about it," he said. "I know the players don't 
like it. They don't like to see their quarterbacks get touched at all." 
</P>
<P>
Is Schroeder better or worse than he looked Sunday, when he completed nine of 
18 passes for 118 yards and one interception? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Jay played pretty good except for a couple of throws," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was an interception in the first quarter, when Schroeder tried to 
drill a pass to Willie Gault while rolling to his right. "The guy (Tyrone 
Braxton) stepped right in front," Schroeder said. "You just can't do that. You 
can't beat the team by turning the ball over." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also was victimized by some dropped passes, too, one long toss in 
particular that Tim Brown couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Schroeder's job is safe for now. Steve Beuerlein, who didn't 
sign until Sept. 3, received a two-week roster exemption and didn't dress 
against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Shell wouldn't say whether Beuerlein would be activated for Sunday's game 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen update: The Raiders' all-time leading rusher played more than 
expected Sunday. He made a brief appearance in the second quarter but was 
forced to leave the game after suffering a gash that required 10 stitches over 
his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Allen returned in the second half and gained 28 yards in his first run of the 
season. He finished with 47 yards, eight carries and one tender sore right 
eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Shell had told him during the week that he would play in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised at all," Allen said. "There's nothing I can do. The coaches 
make the decisions. I try to be a team player and take advantage of the times I 
get to play. . . . I don't think I have anything to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran free safety Vann McElroy ended his summerlong holdout Monday and signed 
a contract with the Raiders. No terms were disclosed. He will receive a 
two-week roster exemption. . . . Shell said the team will probably not keep 
three quarterbacks once Beuerlein is activated, either this week or next. . . . 
Shell said rookie Garry Lewis will remain the starter at left corner over Terry 
McDaniel. McDaniel, reportedly slowed by a hamstring pull, played only in pass 
defense coverages Sunday and scored the game-winning touchdown on a 42-yard 
fumble return.CHRIS DUFRESNE

FINKS SAYS TAGLIABUE NEEDS WORK ON PR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago this week, Jim Finks, the pro football veteran who as president of 
the New Orleans Saints has run the franchise since the middle '80s, was 
apparently on his way to a bigger job -- running the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
On the last ballot, though, Paul Tagliabue edged him, putting Finks in a role 
as observer instead of manager. 
</P>
<P>
His assessment Monday of the man who beat him: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tagliabue is doing an outstanding job on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The commissioner has plenty to learn about public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all impressed with the energy and ability that Paul has shown in trying 
circumstances," Finks said. "He's really getting his arm around the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing he has to learn he will learn -- that everything a commissioner 
says is news. There's no such thing as a throwaway line by an NFL 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Finks was referring to, among other things, three recent Tagliabue remarks 
delivered in a spirit of optimism and openness. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL's owners could have a new collective bargaining agreement with the 
players before the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The league could expand from 28 to, say, 30 teams in the absence of a 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could expand to Canada someday. 
</P>
<P>
Such comments have generated dismay and dissent, requiring Tagliabue to change 
or modify his original positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Canadian friends were on my phone within an hour after they heard 
(Tagliabue)," Finks said, noting that the owners of Canadian Football League 
teams want their country's largest cities to stay in their own league, not jump 
to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
As for pro football's labor problem, the NFL's owners say they haven't talked 
at all to the players lately about a collective bargaining agreement. Most 
owners, moreover, don't want to expand without one. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete (Rozelle) was awfully gifted at seeming to say a lot while actually 
saying almost nothing," Finks said, referring to Tagliabue's public 
relations-minded predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"(Otherwise), I have been personally impressed by Paul's fast start. The thing 
we like about him is that he is very responsive to league problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buck played his college football at the University of Maine, which is 
hardly an NFL factory. But Buck is the Saints' future, they're saying here. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie quarterback who stands 6 feet 3 and weighs 227, he apparently has the 
arm strength and accuracy the club needs to make a Super Bowl move someday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is the first qualified young prospect the Saints have had since we've 
been here," said Finks, the club president and a former NFL quarterback 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"But give him two years. I like to give any young quarterback a couple of years 
before you expect too much of him." 
</P>
<P>
So it will be at least that long before the Saints are a championship 
contender. With their present cast they can win games but not Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Six highly regarded teams might have seriously damaged their playoff chances 
Sunday by blowing their opening games. 
</P>
<P>
Few NFL teams win division titles after losing on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
That was notably true last season -- and also the year before -- when the six 
division champions each year all won the first week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since the league's 16-game schedule began in 1978, only 33 of 154 
opening-day losers have made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Among Sunday's losers were six preseason favorites: Minnesota, Philadelphia, 
Denver, Houston, San Diego and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Among the winners were six teams that now have better chances: Washington, 
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Kansas City, the New York Giants and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when the Chicago Bears' defense made Coach Mike Ditka a 17-0 winner 
over Seattle, the NFL's two run-and-shoot teams, Detroit and Houston, lost. 
</P>
<P>
"You've still got to have a tight end to win in this league," said Ditka, an 
old tight end himself. "The run and shoot will never make a believer of me 
until they win consistently." 
</P>
<P>
That is the Establishment view in the NFL. And in the first of 17 weeks of 1990 
pro football, it seemed clear to all the old pros in the country that what beat 
Detroit and Houston was their tight end void. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerable evidence Sunday, however, that it wasn't that. It wasn't 
the run-and-shoot machinery that broke down. 
</P>
<P>
The more probable reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Atlanta, where the Falcons won, 47-27, Coach Jerry Glanville was lucky 
to catch the Oilers on opening day, before they could sort out all the blocking 
variances of their run and shoot. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, any of the four Houston fumbles that moved Atlanta to its quick 
24-0 lead could have happened -- they have often happened on other days -- in 
the I-formation, or the single wing or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
When not fumbling, Houston quarterback Warren Moon led all of Sunday's NFL 
passers with 397 yards and threw four times for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Detroit, where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won, 38-21, quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde finally played the game his admirers have been awaiting for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that the Buccaneers are finally teaming him with an 
extraordinary talent, former Charger runner-receiver Gary Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde and Anderson won by keeping the ball away from Detroit's run and 
shoot in the last three quarters -- holding possession for 30 minutes 49 
seconds to Detroit's 15:21 -- after quarterback Rodney Peete had marched the 
Lions 80 and 73 yards to a 14-7 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the New York Giants, beating the division-rival Philadelphia Eagles proved 
impossible last year, and also the year before. 
</P>
<P>
After four big games by their quarterback, Randall Cunningham, the Eagles stood 
4-0 in their last four against the Giants going into Sunday night's rematch at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But last week the Giants made an inspired move. When the Eagles unloaded backup 
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh and his $510,000 salary, the Giants promptly signed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
They gained a prompt dividend on the $510,000, beating the Eagles this time, 
27-20. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wanted a spy, we could get one a lot cheaper than that," Giant General 
Manager George Young protested. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaper? Sure. But better? 
</P>
<P>
The backup quarterback is the best informed agent on any club, bar the starter, 
maybe, and a few coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough not to know (the Giants) would ask me some questions," 
Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh is a 13-year pro. The moral for the Eagles, perhaps, is that it would 
be a good idea next time to dismiss experienced backups before training camp, 
not after. 
</P>
<P>
Quote Dept.: 
</P>
<P>
David Meggett, the Giants' 178-pound running back, after his second long punt 
return in consecutive regular-season games had knocked the Eagles back in the 
third quarter, 20-10: "I don't know if it was a turning point, but it put a 
heavy weight on those guys to carry." 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Infante, Green Bay coach, on how he got to the Packers: "If I didn't have 
two good years as a Cleveland (assistant), I wouldn't be here. Bernie (Kosar) 
is probably the reason I have the job." 
</P>
<P>
Agent Mike Moye after Miami lineman Cortez Kennedy signed with Seattle for a 
reported $6.5 million for five years, $2.5 million of it as a signing bonus: 
"(Kennedy) is the highest-paid rookie defensive back in the history of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, NBC analyst, on Bear Coach Mike Ditka's relationships with his 
players: "You can only be real severe when you know the (players) can do 
everything you ask. When they (can't), you have to be real careful of affecting 
their confidence when shaking them up." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kazor, the Bears' tight end coach, on Ditka: "If I had a dollar for every 
time (Ditka) cussed me out, I wouldn't be here. It would be like winning the 
Lotto." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning, San Diego coach, on the NFL: "Your lock on a job in this league is 
only as strong as a locksmith's. A locksmith is a guy who comes in and cuts the 
lock." 
</P>
<P>
Don Shula, Miami coach, after running back Sammie Smith had gained 159 yards -- 
behind the blocking of No. 1 draft choice Richmond Webb and No. 2 draft choice 
Keith Sims -- as the Dolphins overcame New England, 27-24: "Our two rookies are 
going to be extremely good players. I wish that were the biggest of my 
worries."

TORONTO PULLS WITHIN 4 GAMES OF RED SOX

<P>
Behind the pitching of David Wells and the hitting of Kelly Gruber, the Toronto 
Blue Jays chipped another half-game off Boston's lead in the American League 
East on Monday night, defeating the staggering Royals, 6-1, at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who trailed by 6 1/2 games a week ago, are now four back after 
winning their fifth consecutive game while Boston split a doubleheader against 
Milwaukee. Kansas City has lost eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In eight innings, Wells (11-4) held the Royals to four hits, including George 
Brett's league-leading 43rd double. Wells retired 16 consecutive batters before 
John Candelaria pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber, who hit a single, double, sacrifice fly and scored a run, finished with 
four RBIs to give him eight in his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
He hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning to score Mookie Wilson and a two-run 
double in the fifth inning to put the Blue Jays ahead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, Gruber hit a single to score Tony Fernandez, who had 
three hits in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5-1, Milwaukee 4-6 -- Dave Parker hit his 21st home run and Robin Yount 
continued his climb on the all-time hit list as the Brewers beat the Red Sox at 
Boston for a split of a twi-night doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Greg Harris (13-6), the Red Sox won the opener as Luis Rivera keyed a 
four-run fourth inning with a two-run double. The Red Sox hit six doubles, all 
by different players, in an 11-hit attack that included eight hits off starter 
Mark Knudson (10-9) in 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Yount was three for four in the first game, breaking a tie with Lou Gehrig for 
38th place among baseball's all-time hit leaders. He was two for three in the 
second game and has 2,726 career hits. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, the Brewers' Tom Edens (4-2) and Chuck Crim combined to 
outduel Boston's Dana Kiecker (6-8). 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Oakland 2 -- At Seattle, Ken Griffey Sr. hit a three-run home run 
and Eric Hanson pitched a six-hitter to end the Athletics' seven-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson (14-9), pitched 8 2/3 innings, walking one and striking out 10. Keith 
Comstock got the final out for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey's home run off Bob Welch (23-6) with two out in the third inning turned 
a 2-1 lead into a 5-1 advantage. Welch allowed all five runs and eight hits in 
6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 3-2, Chicago 2-6 -- Eric King (9-4) got his first victory since June 
27, and Bobby Thigpen extended his major league record to 49 saves as the White 
Sox ended a four-game losing streak and beat the Indians to split a 
doubleheader at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians won the opener when pinch-hitter Carlos Baerga drew a bases-loaded 
walk from reliever Barry Jones with one out in the ninth inning. The White Sox 
had their chance in the top of the ninth inning, but Doug Jones (5-5) struck 
out two batters with a runner at third base to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Carlton Fisk, who is 42, hit a home run in each game, giving him 17 
for the season and 49 since he turned 40 years old, tying Stan Musial for 
second place in home runs by players 40 years and over. Darrell Evans leads 
that category with 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Baltimore 0 -- Frank Tanana gave up three hits over seven innings 
and Lou Whitaker broke an 0-for-25 slump with a home run and three RBIs as the 
Tigers won at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Tanana (7-7), who entered the game with a 6.06 earned-run average, combined 
with Mike Henneman and Jerry Don Gleaton as the Tigers pitched consecutive 
shutouts for the first time since 1985. The Tigers beat Milwaukee, 5-0, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 1, New York 0 -- Rafael Palmeiro's single with two out in the 11th inning 
lifted the Rangers at New York.

Rookies Scott Chiamparino of Texas and Dave Eiland of New York both pitched 
well. Chiamparino, making his second major league start after being acquired 
from Oakland in the Harold Baines deal last week, gave up four hits in seven 
innings, walking one and striking out four. He is unscored upon in 12 innings

NEWSWIRE: BEN JOHNSON AIMING FOR JANUARY COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sprinter Ben Johnson, declaring himself fit and drug-free, said Monday that he 
will begin his comeback in January after a two-year suspension for steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he wants to win the world and Olympic titles in the next two years 
and regain the world record in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of," 
Johnson said, adding that his first meet would be the Hamilton Spectator Games 
at Hamilton, Canada, Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who said he plans to run in at least 13 indoor competitions in 1991, 
was stripped of the Olympic 100-meter title and of the world record after 
testing positive for steroids at Seoul in September of 1988. His suspension 
expires Sept. 24.

NOTRE DAME REPLACES MIAMI AS NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brigham Young's upset of top-ranked Miami shook up the Associated Press college 
football poll Monday. Notre Dame became No. 1, BYU No. 5 and Miami No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which opens its season Saturday against Michigan, received 37 
first-place votes and 1,451 points from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and 
broadcasters. The Fighting Irish were No. 2 last week. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn, tied at No. 3 with Florida State last week, rose to No. 2 after beating 
Cal State Fullerton, 38-17. Florida State remained in third after beating East 
Carolina, 45-24. Idle Michigan moved up one spot to No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10: No. 6 USC, No. 7 Tennessee, No. 8 Nebraska and No. 9 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks into the college football season, injuries have sidelined 
several standout players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston wide receiver Manny Hazard, who had an NCAA-record 142 catches last 
season, will be out for three weeks because of a dislocated elbow suffered in 
the Cougars' 37-9 victory over Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday. Houston is ranked 
18th. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama running back Siran Stacy, the team's leading rusher, underwent 
surgery on his right knee and is out for the season. Stacy's top backup, 
Derrick Lassic, also was injured Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennessee's Chuck Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards last season, suffered 
torn knee ligaments during a 55-7 rout of Pacific Sept. 1 and will be sidelined 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl Committee rejected an offer to move to Joe Robbie Stadium and 
decided to keep the New Year's night game in its namesake home of 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some committee members argued that the rundown condition of the Orange Bowl 
made necessary a switch to three-year-old Joe Robbie Stadium, located north of 
the city limits but still in Dade County. Other members said moving out of the 
Orange Bowl, near Miami's downtown, would cost the city money and harm its 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Jones, starting quarterback for West Virginia, has been cleared for 
practice after suffering a concussion against Maryland, Coach Don Nehlen said. 
Jones, a fifth-year senior from Miami, Fla., backed up Steve Walsh and Vinny 
Testaverde at Miami before transferring to West Virginia after the 1986 season. 
He had backed up Major Harris the past two seasons.

UCLA QUARTERBACK SITUATION UP IN AIR; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: DONAHUE SAYS THE POSITION WILL BE EVALUATED WEEKLY. DECISION ON 
SATURDAY'S STARTER WILL BE MADE IN MIDWEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most football coaches prefer established players at every position, especially 
quarterback, and UCLA's Terry Donahue is no different. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of his team's 34-14 loss to Oklahoma Saturday at the Rose Bowl, 
Donahue and his staff are reassessing the quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bonds, a junior, started for the first time Saturday after backing up Bret 
Johnson last year. He played with mixed results, completing eight of 14 passes 
for 69 yards and throwing two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox, a redshirt freshman playing in his first game, replaced Bonds 
midway through the third quarter to give the team, as Donahue said, some sort 
of spark. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bonds, Maddox had his good and bad plays, although his passing yardage was 
slightly better. He completed eight of 16 passes for 106 yards but also threw 
two interceptions. Maddox also threw an apparent touchdown pass that was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
So, who will start against Stanford this Saturday at the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Donahue isn't sure, saying a decision will be made at midweek. 
</P>
<P>
"That position will be assessed on a weekly basis," Donahue said. "I know 
philosophically that Homer Smith (offensive coordinator) has no concern moving 
a quarterback up and down. He doesn't feel that should be a consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believes that the quarterback position will be shared this season, 
with even Bert Emanuel, an option-type athlete, as a consideration, Donahue 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too early to tell, but I'd say being around Homer a lot in the 
past, I would certainly say that Homer won't sit pat with a quarterback who 
isn't producing numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Johnson started all 11 games, but was relieved occasionally by 
Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, Donahue didn't have to make weekly decisions on his 
quarterback. Troy Aikman, a gifted quarterback, was the focal point of the 
offense. He later became the first player selected -- by the Dallas Cowboys -- 
in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ramsey was UCLA's starting quarterback for virtually every game from 1980 
through 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Then, because of injuries, or coaching decisions, Matt Stevens, David Norrie, 
Steve Bono and Rick Neuheisel shared the position from time to time until 
Aikman took over. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it seems that the starting quarterback may be determined from week to 
week. As Donahue said, Smith is interested in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue says that the quality of his team is not as good now as it was in other 
years, referring to the 1980s when the Bruins won seven consecutive bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
He said, in essence, that UCLA hasn't replaced quality players with those of 
equal skills. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said he hasn't had a quarterback who performed as well as Aikman, or a 
tailback the caliber of Gaston Green, or a linebacker who could run like 
Carnell Lake. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, could be construed as recruiting failure, or having to settle 
for players available at the time, taking academic standards into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"The caliber (of our players) is not of years past," Donahue said. "Who is 
responsible? I am." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Donahue says his team will improve as the season progresses, 
especially when injured players such as linebacker Roceen Keeton and wide 
receiver Scott Miller return, and he anticipates that UCLA will be better 
Saturday against Stanford than it was against Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford opened the season last Thursday against Colorado at Boulder, and the 
heavily favored Buffaloes had to score in the closing seconds to beat the 
Cardinal, 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised that Stanford was as good a football team as they are," 
Donahue said, referring to the Colorado game. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the good teams when you look at film. They are much better in the 
lines than they've been. Last year they punched us out (17-13) in the second 
half. They controlled the ball for 8 1/2 minutes. That's a real concern." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has an exciting halfback in Glyn Milburn, the former Santa Monica High 
School star who transferred from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn accounted for 158 all-purpose yards against Colorado, getting 73 of 
them on a punt return that set up a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue compares Milburn, a sophomore, to Darrin Nelson, Stanford's versatile 
halfback of the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Of immediate concern to Donahue is finding someone who can catch punts without 
fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Sean LaChapelle muffed a punt in the first quarter Saturday and Oklahoma 
recovered the ball, setting up a short-yardage touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the second quarter, Reggie Moore backpedaled and muffed another punt, 
setting up another Oklahoma touchdown from the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the resources of UCLA, I have to find a punt catcher. That's all there 
is to it," Donahue said. "I'll continue to look at the punt catchers we have -- 
LaChapelle, Moore, Ricky Davis and Shawn Wills. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a good punt catcher in Scott Miller before he went down. 
It's an area we have to work on today (even) if I have to keep the team out to 
midnight."

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: IN SILICON VALLEY, THE JOBS ARE CHANGING AS FAST AS 
TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SUNNYVALE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around this Silicon Valley town, people are used to changing jobs: A woman 
tells a neighbor that she's hoping to be laid off this fall because, after 
several years of working on a defense electronics project, she needs a rest. 
She's not worried about finding another job and plans to go back to work 
sometime next year. Defense jobs may be ending, but something else will come 
along, she says. 
</P>
<P>
A state-of-the-art outplacement center that opened last month assists laid-off 
high-tech workers in "career networking." Layoffs are expected to increase this 
fall, but some employment experts call it nothing more than normal "tech 
turnover." 
</P>
<P>
Although people seem acutely aware that the Silicon Valley may feel a pinch 
from defense and commercial manufacturing cutbacks, there is a blase attitude 
here. It's a sharp contrast to the pervasive worry in Southern California's 
defense industry, where cutbacks are also expected to wipe out thousands of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The difference seems to derive from how industry developed in the Silicon 
Valley. And the way this area copes with change and layoffs may offer clues 
about where the labor force as a whole is headed. 
</P>
<P>
When integrated circuits first came on the scene in the 1950s and 1960s, the 
silicon wafers on which they are printed gave this area a new name and a new 
reputation. As brilliant young computer whizzes moved into the towns around San 
Jose, traditional industries -- most notably the fruit packers and canners, who 
had been here for decades -- gradually moved out. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, these whizzes were researchers and inventors, not 
businessmen. They often came from academic backgrounds, and they disdained 
corporate style. No neckties worn, no time clocks punched. They were also 
restless and, as with most theorists and researchers, always eager for the next 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they didn't need much capital investment to set up shop. Brains 
were their principal asset. Leaving one firm to work for a competitor -- 
considered disloyal or worse in most industries -- became the thing most 
techies did. And all the companies expected it -- so much so that many had 
minimal employment benefits or pension plans. If few employees stayed more than 
three or four years, why bother? 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of youth. The industry is young -- less than 30 years 
old, for the most part -- and the work force is among the youngest in U.S. 
industry. Older employees frequently leave this industry because of its rapid 
job turnover and its focus on youth. Job security is less of an issue for those 
in the early years of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
And the matter of obsolescence. By nature, high technology thrives on 
advancements and new products. Many products are obsolete no more than three 
years after they hit the market. What that means is that workers shift from 
project to project and product to product in an endless cycle of change. 
Loyalties are fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a 'cutting-edge junkie' attitude here," says journalist and Silicon 
Valley observer Mike Malone. "A fair number of these people get bored quickly 
and say, 'Why should I stay here and work on this same old project when I can 
jump ship and do cutting-edge stuff?' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as the industry grew, especially during the 1980s, some of these 
trends changed. Most notably, the bigger companies began offering better 
benefits to keep their employees from jumping. 
</P>
<P>
But the short cycle of economic life continues. This has made the Silicon 
Valley a mobile and transient place, where people move in and leave constantly. 
The expectation of changing jobs and moving is a given -- even a "tradition" -- 
here. 
</P>
<P>
That seems to account for the seeming lack of worry about layoffs, even though 
the signs are clearly evident. Some large employers have already made sizable 
cuts, and there are predictions that as many as 20,000 electronics 
manufacturing jobs could be lost over the next year. Many of those will be in 
defense projects, others in commercial semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
Something else will come along, one hears again and again. Technology and new 
products will develop. Some military projects are ending, the thinking goes, 
but advanced electronics and research must remain a part of future Pentagon 
budgets, no matter how much they shrink. If commercial semiconductor 
manufacturing is shrinking right now, all it means is that we're in a lull 
between breakthroughs. Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this optimism is the outgrowth of youthful enthusiasm in a new industry 
that has never had a prolonged downturn. Could a laid-off defense worker in 
Southern California be as buoyant, knowing that jobs are likely to be scarce 
for a long time and that his skills are no longer in big demand? The answer, of 
course, is no. 
</P>
<P>
But the lessons of the Silicon Valley's employment habits might still be 
transferable. The prospects for the technology business are as infinite as 
human imagination. And, in the truest sense, most jobs these days are 
technology-related. 
</P>
<P>
The Silicon Valley has proved that technology makes products -- and the workers 
who make them -- become obsolete quicker. But that can be viewed more as an 
opportunity than a threat, as each new generation of products brings new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The rapidity of obsolescence also breeds new companies to produce new products, 
and indeed in the Silicon Valley -- despite almost three decades of growth -- 
75% of the employers still have fewer than 200 employees. More new products, 
more new companies, more new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter the cycle between obsolescence and new products, the more 
frequently a worker may have to change jobs. In the Silicon Valley, they have 
learned to keep their bags packed.

OIL PRICES TUMBLE, REBOUND WILDLY TO CLOSE UP $1.26 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a dramatic last-minute surge, crude oil prices on Monday -- after falling 
steeply earlier in the day -- shot up $1.26 to more than $31 a barrel on 
apparently unfounded rumors of Iraqi troop movements toward Jordan and Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The day's wild swings were symbolic of the tension and uncertainty that have 
loomed over energy markets since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. "This 
shows how nervous the market really is," said Andrew Lebow, oil analyst with E. 
D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. "At 3 p.m. it just started to blow. 
I really can't tell you why." 
</P>
<P>
The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the nation's benchmark crude, 
to be delivered in October rose to $31.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Earlier in the day, prices had fallen as low as $28.35 a barrel in reaction to 
Sunday's meeting of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 
Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
The October contract price of regular unleaded gasoline, which had fallen to 87 
cents a gallon early in the day, closed up 1.5 cents at 94.56 cents a gallon. 
Heating oil rose 1.91 cents to 85.89 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Shock waves from the turbulent trading session in the energy markets spilled 
over onto Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 30 points on 
early news of falling oil prices, only to close down 3.96 points at 2,615.59 
following the increase in energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
The market had initially expected an easing of Mideast tensions as a result of 
the Helsinki summit, where Bush and Gorbachev called on Iraq to withdraw its 
troops from Kuwait. Many analysts believed their united front would force Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Prices remained relatively unchanged later in the day after Hussein offered 
free oil to Third World nations that were able to arrange for its 
transportation. The offer would require the nations to break the worldwide 
embargo and blockade of Iraqi and Kuwaiti imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
Then about 15 minutes before the close, market watchers were stunned as prices 
shot up to recoup earlier losses on Monday as well as those on Friday. Traders 
said various unconfirmed umors began to circulate late in the day, including 
one about Iraqi troops massing on the Jordanian border and of Saddam Hussein 
sending commando units to destroy Saudi Arabian oil fields. There were no news 
reports to support the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out of a meeting and rang up the (Quotron) screen and said, 'Whoa, what 
happened?" said Robert Weiss, oil industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poors 
Corp. "There is a lot of jitteriness, and the slightest rumor sets off 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy, a futures trading firm, said 
market players jumped into the spiral, fearing that they would be left behind 
if they did not buy. 
</P>
<P>
"People were not waiting for confirmation" of rumors, Bentz said. "People don't 
want to be waiting around to see what the real story is. They just panic and 
are just buying on the close." 
</P>
<P>
While the crude oil market see-sawed, U.S. energy officials in Washington 
predicted that supplies of gasoline and fuel oil for the rest of the year would 
be tight but adequate unless war breaks out or if there is an unusually cold 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin A. Kent, head of the department's Energy Information Administration, 
which collects and analyzes energy information, told the House energy and power 
subcommittee that U.S. petroleum inventories "appear adequate" and that a 
worldwide crude oil shortage of a million barrels a day later this winter "can 
be handled." The shortfall is linked to the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.) was more pessimistic. 
"There now is a very small margin of safety," he said. The Energy Department, 
he added, "tends to underestimate what can go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But some other energy experts said they believe the nation will be able to ride 
out the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Energy consultant Scott T. Jones, president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia, 
estimated that to offset the shortfall the United States will draw down its 
record high oil inventories by an average of 1.5 million barrels a day during 
the three months ending Sept. 30. But that figure should fall to an average of 
700,000 barrels a day during the last three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be close, but we should be all right," Jones said.

AGENCIES CLASH ON CAPITAL RESERVE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE FDIC WANTS A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THE CURRENCY COMPTROLLER DOES. A 
SENATE PANEL CHAIRMAN TELLS THEM TO AGREE -- SOON.

<P>
Federal regulators clashed sharply before a Senate panel on Monday over how 
much capital banks should be required to hold in reserve, heightening the 
controversy over regulation of the increasingly troubled industry. 
</P>
<P>
Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said his office should have 
discretion to decide when individual banks need more money in reserve than a 
basic capital standard equal to 3% of assets. 
</P>
<P>
But the comptroller's plan drew a strong rebuke from Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who favors a plan requiring virtually all 
banks to meet a capital standard of about 4.5% of assets. Seidman argued before 
the Senate Banking Committee that Clarke's proposal actually represented a 
weakening of current standards and would be dangerous at a time when banks are 
already under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances should we indicate to 10,000 banks that their capital 
can be reduced," Seidman said. Many of the nation's smaller banks, closely 
supervised by regulators, have capital far above both the current standard and 
the one proposed by Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
The current standard requires banks to have capital equal to 6% of their 
assets, but the rule allows goodwill -- the intangible value of a firm -- to be 
included. Financial regulators have agreed that a new standard should restrict 
what could be counted as capital to such assets as cash and government 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke argued that given the more limited definition of what counts as assets, 
the 3% requirement represents a sufficient strengthening of standards. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Clarke, who oversees banks with national charters, and 
Seidman, who provides the insurance that guarantees deposits up to $100,000, 
irked the committee chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see this settled in the next 30 days, if possible," he told a 
panel of regulators, including Clarke, Seidman and Federal Reserve Board 
Governor Wayne D. Angell. "We've got to get this settled." 
</P>
<P>
The insurance fund protecting bank deposits "is under very severe stress and 
has been for some time," Riegle said. "The reserve is dropping, and there is a 
hollowing out of real estate values region by region. I don't think we can fool 
around longer with the capital issue unsettled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Capital represents the money contributed to a financial institution by its 
owners. It represents a bulwark against the kinds of risky and frivolous 
investments that drove hundreds of savings and loan associations into 
insolvency during the 1980s. With little of their own money at risk, many 
S&amp;L owners invested recklessly, knowing that federal insurance would bail 
out depositors in case of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Strict capital standards could avert a repetition of the disastrous experience, 
Congress decided last year when it wrote the S&amp;L rescue legislation. New 
S&amp;L standards were required by the law. 
</P>
<P>
But new bank standards have yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital is the key to safety and soundness of the banking system," Riegle 
said, urging the regulators to settle a disagreement that has raged for nearly 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with thousands of supervisors and banks; they need a clearly 
defined standard," said Seidman. Although he originally favored a 4.5% 
requirement for all banks, he has agreed to accept a Federal Reserve Board 
proposal calling for a standard of 3%, plus an additional amount for all banks 
except a handful awarded the top safety rating by regulators. In practice, this 
would mean virtually all banks would need capital close to Seidman's original 
proposal of 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows we need more of a capital cushion," Fed member Angell told the 
committee. The 3% standard "may not provide as much protection as we need for a 
banking system entering a stress period," he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, by contrast, said that 3% should be acceptable, and that his office 
would decide on a case-by-case basis when to go higher. "We all embrace 3%; 
what is at stake is how we implement it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Seidman rejected the notion of giving the comptroller wide discretion, 
saying: "It's absolutely essential we agree on capital standards. That's no way 
to run a government." 
</P>
<P>
"We've come up with everything we could to accommodate Mr. Clarke," Seidman 
said. He told reporters after testifying that he was "mystified" by Clarke's 
insistence on the 3% standard. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said it was "misleading" for Seidman to suggest that thousands of banks 
would be permitted to reduce their capital under his plan. "We will not allow 
them to operate at the minimum" standard, Clarke told the committee.

Chip Industry Barometer Falls: The semiconductor industry's benchmark indicator 
dipped in August to its lowest level since November. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose-based Semiconductor Industry Assn. said the book-to-bill ratio, 
which compares orders with shipments, fell to 0.99 in August from 1 in July. A 
book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 means that for every $100 of semiconductors shipped 
to the U.S. market in the three months ended in August, chip manufacturers 
received new orders worth $99. A ratio of less than 1 is considered unhealthy 
for the industry.

McDonnell Transfers Pension Fund: McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it would record 
a net gain of $234 million in the third quarter from a change it is making in 
an over-funded pension plan for retired workers. The St. Louis-based defense 
contractor said Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has agreed to buy an annuity 
contract that will provide benefits to about 14,200 retired participants in a 
$5.9-billion plan for salaried former employees.

LABOR / HARRY BERNSTEIN: ECONOMIC ILLS MAY BOOST UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union leaders made their now-familiar "Our-Great-Days-Are-Coming" Labor Day 
speeches last week, but the harsh fact remains that as things stand the future 
of organized labor in the United States looks bleak. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, unions represented 35% of private sector workers in America. 
Today, they represent 13%, by far the lowest percentage in any industrialized 
country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Even more discouraging are recent studies by experts -- and not anti-union ones 
-- predicting that by the year 2000, only 5% of America's private sector 
workers will be union members. 
</P>
<P>
That grim prospect could change if, among other things, unions can carry out 
their latest pledge to intensify use of one of their oldest but often neglected 
functions: organizing new members. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an opportune time for such a campaign. A new, comprehensive report 
by the Economic Policy Institute on the steadily deteriorating lot of most 
American workers suggests that, for the first time in years, many may be ready 
to listen to union organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mishel, an author of the report, "The State of Working America," says 
that as the country slips into a recession, the average working family is much 
worse off than when we moved into previous recessions. 
</P>
<P>
That means that workers won't be able to weather a recession as well as they 
did in the past. While workers obviously need help, as the report clearly 
shows, that doesn't mean that they will rush to join unions in massive numbers, 
as they did in the Depression years. But their increasing economic troubles 
these days should make the arguments of organizers more persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage them to join, the national AFL-CIO has for the first time started 
recruiting and training what it calls a new generation of young, idealistic 
union organizers from the Peace Corps, political staffs, college campuses, 
community groups and local unions. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented program should add momentum to the organizing drives that 
many individual unions are already intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, the still small national program is concentrating on women and 
minorities. They could be the most receptive to organizing efforts because 
their wages and benefits remain substantially below those of white males. 
</P>
<P>
The 312-page institute study leaves little doubt about the economic problems of 
most workers. 
</P>
<P>
It spells out the spectacular income growth of the wealthy and the steadily 
diminishing income of the average worker. It shows that near-record numbers of 
workers have been forced to take second jobs to maintain their standard of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between the wealthy and the average American widened in part because of 
the loss of many well-paid, unionized factory jobs, overall loss of labor's 
strength and the handsome tax advantages that began flowing to the rich soon 
after Ronald Reagan became President in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that not only did average real hourly wages of workers 
drop by nearly 10% during the Reagan-Bush years, but that younger workers' 
basic wages today are substantially less than those earned by young people a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly shocking figure: Young black men today earn 21.6% less than 
their counterparts a decade ago, after inflation is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
Even though more women than ever are working, home ownership by young families 
has dropped nearly 8% in the past 10 years -- because even the combined incomes 
of husbands and wives are often no longer enough to buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, there has been a wage and fringe benefit advantage for union 
workers, although it hasn't resulted in union membership gains. That well-known 
income differential could bolster labor's renewed organizing efforts, in view 
of the worsening economic plight of most workers and the probability of a 
recession exacerbated by the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between union and non-union wages has diminished somewhat in 
recent years because of job losses in union factories and increasingly tough 
employers. Nevertheless, the institute study showed that white males in unions 
earn 18.8% more than their non-union counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The union advantage is far more dramatic for blacks, Latinos and women. 
</P>
<P>
Unionized blacks and Latinos earn 55% more than those who are not union 
members, and the union advantage for women is 33.4%. Those facts should be 
useful to organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, more is needed to improve the fortunes of unions that have helped 
millions of workers get decent incomes and move into the middle class. Congress 
must pass some reasonable measures to ease repressive labor laws, such as the 
ridiculous one that allows employers to "permanently replace" striking workers, 
even though they cannot be fired for exercising their legal right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Labor law reform has to be adopted by a margin wide enough to override a 
certain veto by the anti-union Bush, and that is most unlikely until more 
pro-labor candidates are elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Unions must also vigorously pursue their battles against vicious anti-union 
employers -- to persuade other employers that cooperation with labor is 
preferable to labor wars. Workers and their unions don't always win such 
battles, but some do -- like the coal miners, who set a fine example with their 
recent lengthy, successful strike. 
</P>
<P>
Even when there is no clear-cut victory, unions can improve their status when 
they show that the cost of doing battle against them is prohibitively high, as 
workers are doing in strikes against Eastern Airlines and Greyhound Lines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe before too many more Labor Days go by, unions will regain some of their 
old vigor, which will help balance the growth of corporate power. More 
important, perhaps future studies by the Economic Policy Institute will show 
happier times for the average American worker.

JAPAN AIR LINES INVESTS IN LOCKHEED SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed said Monday that Japan Air Lines will be the first customer for its 
new aircraft maintenance center in San Bernardino and will make an equity 
investment of several million dollars into the Lockheed subsidiary doing the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding, JAL will take roughly a 10% equity 
position in the Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Inc., a subsidiary located 
at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, said Skip Bowling, a Lockheed vice 
president overseeing the new operation. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed formed the operation earlier this year, planning to use hangars that 
will be vacated by the Air Force when it shuts down the base in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling said the JAL work will amount to about 15% of the capacity of the new 
operation, which will be dedicated solely to doing structural modifications and 
maintenance on aging Boeing 747 jetliners. Under Federal Aviation 
Administration directives, aged 747s must go through extensive modifications to 
strengthen their structure. Those modifications take up to 90 days per 
aircraft, in addition to routine structural work. 
</P>
<P>
JAL has the world's largest fleet of 747s, operating 65 aircraft currently with 
commitments for another 69. In addition to investing in the operation, JAL will 
have a management role in quality control, a Lockheed spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the reputation in the industry of having one of the best quality 
control capabilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling said Lockheed is initially investing about $20 million to refurbish and 
outfit two hangars at the military base to conduct 747 maintenance work. 
Lockheed expects to have 600 people working at the facility by 1992 and a total 
of 1,000 when all four hangars are in operation, a spokesman said.

DOW FALLS 3.96 AFTER MORNING RALLY FIZZLES

<P>
Blue chip stock prices fell slightly Monday after a run-up in oil prices 
spurred a late afternoon burst of selling on Wall Street and erased earlier 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 3.96 points at 2,615.59. In the 
broader market, however, advancing shares outpaced losers by a narrow margin of 
759 to 726. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume remained light, with 119.7 million shares changing hands, 
compared to 123.8 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices surged in the afternoon on rumors that Iraqi troops were heading 
toward Jordan. The rumors were later denied by U.S. officials but not before 
October crude rose $1.26 to close at $31.30 a barrel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
At one point early in the day, crude had lost nearly $2 and the Dow index was 
up 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from oil, investors were concerned that little progress was reported from 
marathon weekend talks on cutting the federal budget deficit. The White House 
said the Bush Administration did not expect to reach a budget agreement with 
Congress soon. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of worry about the Middle East and the weak U.S. economy spells 
trouble for stocks, analysts say. "I think we're going down further, and that 
in a week or so, we'll take another look at the August lows," said Alfred 
Goldman, analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Gold stocks tumbled as the price of the metal dropped. ASA fell 2 to 47, 
Newmont Gold lost 1 7/8 to 43 1/8, and Echo Bay fell 3/4 to 12 1/4. Oil stocks, 
meanwhile, were mixed as oil had another roller-coaster day. Arco lost 1 3/8 to 
137 1/8 and Unocal dropped 7/8 to 32 1/2, but Tosco added 1/8 to 21 1/4 and 
Unocal Exploration rose 3/8 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
* UAL Corp. closed up 2 at 102 1/4 after trading as high as 106 3/8 in fairly 
brisk trading. The rise was based on rumors -- first making the rounds on 
Friday -- that Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis might finance a new bid for 
the parent of United Airlines with profits from the sale of his famous Pebble 
Beach golf resort. 
</P>
<P>
* Toys R Us continued to fall on worries about slowing retail sales. It lost 1 
to 22 1/8, a 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors moved back into some recently battered growth issues, including 
Conner Peripherals, up 1 1/4 to 23 1/2, Dreyer's Ice Cream, up 1 7/8 to 39 1/8, 
and retailer Wet Seal, up 1 3/4 to 13 3/4. The NASDAQ composite index of 
over-the-counter stocks rose 1.35 to 381.73 for the day, bucking the Dow's 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
* Cable-TV stocks, long depressed, were little changed despite House approval 
of a bill bringing cable regulation back under federal control. 
Tele-Communications inched up 1/8 to 11 1/4, Cablevision added 1/4 to 17 1/4 
and Viacom slipped 1/8 to 18 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Some Southland stocks highlighted at the annual Montgomery Securities 
conference in San Francisco gained. Mattel rose 5/8 to 19 1/4 after its chief 
said the company sees strong international growth offsetting slower domestic 
growth. Optical Radiation jumped 1 1/8 to 30 3/4 after reporting income from 
continuing operations of 58 cents a share in the latest quarter, ahead of 
analyst estimates. Sales rose 22%. 
</P>
<P>
* McDonnell Douglas jumped 1 1/8 to 48 3/4. The firm will record a one-time 
gain of $234 million related to the over-funding of its pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed sharply higher with the benchmark Nikkei average 
charting its sixth-largest gain in history. However, the action came on thin 
volume. The Nikkei jumped 1,118.83 points, or 4.7%, to 25,080.90 after gaining 
150.16 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange took heart from sharp gains on Tokyo and in early 
trading on Wall Street, along with a larger-than-expected drop of 1.6% in 
Britain's August retail sales. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 24.1 
points higher at 2,147. 
</P>
<P>
West German shares advanced in moderate trading but dealers remained far from 
convinced that a new positive mood was entering the market. In Frankfurt, the 
DAX 30-share index ended up 37.52 points at 1,600.45. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Drop in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices fell in light trading as oil prices rose and investers 
grew pessimistic about an early resolution to federal budget negotiations, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 
8.96% from 8.91% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As with stocks, bonds tracked the seesaw in oil prices. Bond investors fear 
signs of inflation, such as rising oil prices, because inflation erodes the 
value of such fixed-return investments. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.938%, down from 8% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Investors Put Money in Strengthened Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against most major currencies, but it was the Japanese yen that 
dominated foreign exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the yen, which fell sharply in recent weeks as tensions continued 
in the Persian Gulf, regained strength following the Bank of Japan's decision 
Aug. 30 to raise its discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has raised interest in Japanese 
investments, and traders who had placed their money into currencies such as the 
British pound recently were now turning to the yen, said James T. McGroarty, a 
senior vice president with Greenwich Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was higher against all major currencies except the yen Monday, but 
"it's more of an individual currency assessment rather than an overall dollar 
view," McGroarty said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar fell to 139.52 yen from late Friday's 140.10. But 
against the German mark, the dollar jumped to 1.582 from 1.568 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound fell sharply against the dollar, closing at $1.858 in New 
York, compared to Friday's $1.893. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold, Silver Futures Turn Sharply Lower 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metal futures prices tumbled, reflecting a stronger dollar and 
pronounced weakness in the oil market for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, copper futures sank, grains and soybeans were mixed 
and livestock and meat futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $10.90 to $12.60 lower, 
with the contract for delivery in September down $10.90 at $378.60 an ounce; 
silver for September finished at $4.75, off 4.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum futures ended $24.30 to $24.80 lower on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, with September at $455.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures followed gold and silver lower on the Commodity Exchange. Copper 
gave back more than a quarter of Friday's gains, which had pushed the market to 
its highest level in nearly a year.

REIT SUBMITS A PLAN FOR REORGANIZATION OF ITS DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, a major real estate investment trust that sought 
bankruptcy court protection despite being profitable, said Monday that it 
submitted a reorganization plan that calls for full repayment of its debts. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for Mortgage &amp; Realty, an Elkins Park, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
-based concern that has executive offices in Burbank, to resume dividend 
payments so it can keep its status as an REIT. Such trusts escape corporate 
income taxes if nearly all of their profit is distributed to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty suspended its dividends when it filed under Chapter 11 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 12. Under Chapter 11, a company is shielded 
from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its bills. Creditors' 
claims -- all unsecured -- totaled $397 million as of June 30. Mortgage &amp; 
Realty's assets totaled $595 million.

L.A. FESTIVAL FINDING ITS PLACE IN THE SUN; 
</P>
<P>
GRIFFITH PARK: ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS BRAVE THE SWELTERING WEEKEND HEAT TO VIEW 
PACIFIC RIM CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The air was steamy and the music was hot as Wilfred Latour and his Zydeco 
Goodtime Aces churned out their Cajun-spiced tunes at the L.A. Festival over 
the weekend. But despite the fever pitch, the joint wasn't exactly jumping. 
</P>
<P>
The joint in this case was the old Los Angeles Zoo grounds above the 
merry-go-round in Griffith Park where the festival pitched its tent over the 
weekend for two days of free, continuous performances marking the 17-day 
event's second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, as at last weekend's opening ceremonies in San Pedro, the 
festivities drew a turnout that fell well short of expectations. Although 
festival officials said crowds from 12,000 to 30,000 attended park festival 
events, rangers estimated 3,200 people came on Saturday and 4,000 showed up on 
Sunday. Organizers had hoped to attract 10,000 spectators each day since the 
park normally draws about 3,000 people on Saturday and 5,000 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and some crowd members said the 90-plus-degree weather was a 
significant factor in the sparse attendance. Spectator Paul Carpenter of Van 
Nuys said he chose to show up late Sunday and miss most of the events rather 
than brave the heat. "I knew if I came at 1 p.m., I would just bake," Carpenter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sweltering heat seemed to take at least some effect on those who decided 
not to show up -- and those who did. As mariachis and other musicians sweated 
and stomped under gaily colored overhangs, many in the audience lay back on the 
grass, their eyes closed, plastic water bottles and soft drinks within arm's 
reach. Swarms of wasps buzzed around soft-drink stands and snow cone booths as 
patrons lined up for refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
The artists also felt the sting of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hot, and I can hardly keep my eyes open because of the sun's 
reflection," said Pintang Ouk, a lead dancer for the Cambodian Dance and Music 
Project of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Carpets had to be placed on the stages during Sunday performances by the 
Cambodians and the Asian Indian Children because the stage was too hot. Even 
though dances revolve around slapping sounds made by feet on the hard stage, 
stage managers feared that the performers would get heat blisters if the 
carpets were not placed on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Many acts that played on three stages through the afternoons drew enthusiastic 
responses, but the applause did not come close to the excited ovations that 
greeted some of the Pacific Rim-oriented exotic dance and music groups last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Organization also seemed to lack last weekend's planning. Festival-goers were 
instructed to park in remote lots and ride shuttle buses, which were supposed 
to run within minutes of each other, to the site. But many festival-goers were 
stranded for longer periods at the lots, while others said they had difficulty 
knowing where to park because no traffic officers were there to direct them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drawbacks, attendees genuinely seemed to enjoy the activities and 
performances. And the small turnout appeared to make the event more agreeable 
to those unnerved by the large crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a relief to go somewhere and enjoy music without all the hassles," 
said Stuart Wright, who drove Saturday from Orange County. "Everything is so 
unrushed, so relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
At times, the event took on the loose atmosphere of an intimate outdoor rock 
concert -- without the alcohol and war-whoops. T-shirts and shorts were the 
uniform of the day. Many munched on Thai barbecue chicken sticks or fried rice 
while watching the performances. Some bounced around in time to the music, but 
it seemed too hot to dance. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood of the day was so laid-back that audiences were able to approach 
the Woomera Mornington Island Culture Team after its aboriginal dances to take 
pictures with the made-up performers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most enthusiastically received performance groups was the Glover, 
Vt.-based Bread and Puppet Theatre, which used giant masks and props in its 
presentation of "The Same Boat, or the Life and Death of Chico Mendes," the 
union leader who was killed in his fight to save the Amazon rain forest. The 
troupe performed the play as a processional, moving to four locations across 
the park as the audience followed. It was marred only when loud music from one 
of the other stages drowned out some dialogue and songs from the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Saturday was devoted to a mariachi festival. Groups such as Cuica 
Calli, Conjunto Jarocho Papaloapan and El Mariachi Los Camperos played 
traditional Mexican music. Musician Alex Cline played Eastern and jazz-flavored 
percussion pieces and the Tango Tres group illustrated tango dances through the 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
The variety of the acts appealed to some crowd members. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like the fact that you can see all kinds of different things," said 
Mfundi Vundia of Toluca Lake. "You can really get a sense of the universal 
aspects that bind all these expressions together." Vundia said he was not able 
to make it to the San Pedro ceremonies, "so I'm really glad they're bringing 
the festival to me, so close to me." 
</P>
<P>
Festival director Peter Sellars walked among the crowd in his trademark African 
Marketplace pants and a black T-shirt. "This is fabulous," he said, referring 
to the mood and the spirit of the performances. Some audience members expressed 
their thanks to Sellars personally.

CINETEX STILL TRYING TO TAKE ROOT; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION: ORGANIZERS OF THE ANNUAL GATHERING OF FILM PEOPLE IN LAS VEGAS ARE 
CONSIDERING A MOVE TO LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the animated heads, plastic props and plastered posters that decorated 
Cinetex '90 packed up and ready for shipment home, the people who brought the 
film festival/expo/market to this neon gambling resort for the third straight 
year are still searching the horizon for signs of a living oak. 
</P>
<P>
When Cinetex was announced a few years ago, corporate founder Sheldon G. 
Adelson likened its first year to the planting of an acorn. In time, a mighty 
oak. To Adelson, who heads the Boston-based Interface Group, the mighty oak 
that he hoped to grow is a film event on American soil to rival that famous one 
held each year in France. 
</P>
<P>
But two years and $7 million in net losses later, Cinetex is still just an 
acorn. There is talk now that it may be transplanted as early as next year to 
Los Angeles, where, as the home of the film industry, there ought to be plenty 
of fertilizer available, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Others are saying that Cinetex will likely stay in Las Vegas, at least for the 
two years remaining in Adelson's five-year commitment. The original idea was to 
create a major event that Interface, the organizer of such conventions as the 
massive Consumer Electronics Show, could handle and service for years to come. 
The company owns a charter airline, a travel agency and the Sands Hotel, which 
next year will have the largest hotel convention hall in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Were the event to become successful, it would need a lot of space. Sellers of 
territorial rights to films need hotel suites in which to host potential 
buyers. Hall space will be needed for exhibits, large rooms will be needed for 
seminars and workshops, theaters will be needed for screenings. But while 
participants here remain upbeat about the future of Cinetex, signs of growth 
are not too bountiful. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of exhibitor-sellers, show officials report, was slightly down 
this year because of the demise of some independent film companies. Still, they 
claim that about 60% of this year's 60 exhibitors represent repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of buyers was up to about 600, but the number fell far short of 
the 1,000 that organizers had hoped for, and about 200 of those on hand were 
flown in and put up at Interface's expense. 
</P>
<P>
* Unofficially, attendance was up over last year's reported total of 2,000, but 
apparently not by much. 
</P>
<P>
* The Cinetex International Comedy Film Festival, supervised by the American 
Film Institute, upped its number of independent and foreign-movie screenings to 
11, and -- probably a first for any film festival -- audiences were "warmed up" 
by stand-up comics. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of seminars operated by AFI was also up, with workshops ranging 
from special effects to project pitching. 
</P>
<P>
* Although expenditures continued to mount, officials looked at the bright 
side, saying that if the event is moved to the Sands next year, costs of 
hosting the event will be cut considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the halls of Bally's were alive with the speculation that at least some 
portion of the show will move to Los Angeles next year, closer to the studio 
and television executives who have not bought many tickets to Cinetex. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 30 days of the closing we will have evaluated this year's show and 
decided if a move to Los Angeles might be a good strategy," said Jason 
Chudnofsky, president and chief operating officer of the Interface Group. "We 
will listen to our buyers and our sellers and the press. Our advisers will tell 
us if a move to Los Angeles would be the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the brochure for Cinetex '91, circulated to exhibitors, promises a 
return to Vegas Sept. 20-24 at "the fabulous new Sands Expo and Convention 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the next Cinetex is held, the folks at AFI seemingly couldn't be 
happier with the arrangement. To produce its 42 seminars and workshops, its 
three tributes (honored were Elliot Gould, Garry Marshall and Teri Garr) and 
its assortment of films, AFI gets a $200,000 contribution from the Interface 
Group for its Los Angeles Film Festival and its Las Vegas Cinetex expenses 
covered.

MOVIES: 'HOME ON THE RANGE' LOOKS AT THE CONFLICT OVER WHO OWNS RIGHTS TO TINY 
KWAJALEIN ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everyone loves a David-and-Goliath story -- including documentarian Adam 
Horowitz, who figured he would be filming one when he went to the Marshall 
Islands in 1986 to shoot a standoff between the U.S. Army and a 79-year-old 
native who claimed the military's missile-testing base was illegally occupying 
his land. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when the Goliath in question is the American military, and David is 
an aged chieftain on a tiny Pacific island, it follows that -- sentimental 
favoritism aside -- one might want to hold off placing bets on the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz's documentary, "Home on the Range," does indeed turn out to be your 
basic man-fights-system, man-loses-against-system story, the kind of heroically 
downbeat true-life narrative on which liberal-leaning agitprop thrives. 
</P>
<P>
"The film is pretty overtly political, I guess," Horowitz said, almost 
resignedly, by phone from his Santa Fe, N. M. home. "That's hard to get away 
from. From my own philosophical or political feelings, I was interested in the 
story. As far as any political messages, for me, it's about imperialism; it's 
about a military machine that's out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"But as a filmmaker, what interested me the most was this 72-year-old man 
single-handedly taking on the United States Army. It's primarily the story of 
this man fighting for his rights and fighting for his family's future. I think 
whatever political statements come out of it are really secondary to that. A 
good way to understand complex issues is by getting to know one individual's 
experience, to try and put things in a perspective that people can understand." 
</P>
<P>
"Home on the Range" -- which had its local premiere at the AFI International 
Film Festival this spring and was screened last month on KCET -- will be shown 
Wednesday at Los Feliz Theater as part of the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The work, narrated in part by James Whitmore and Lou Diamond Phillips, takes a 
look at a conflict of interests in the Marshall Islands, home to an American 
defense testing base since World War II, and the site of a lagoon where 
missiles launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base land every week. 
</P>
<P>
The area is also home to more than 10,000 natives, many of whom were displaced 
shortly after World War II when the Army leased land on the Kwajalein Atoll for 
a base and relocated residents to the tiny island of Ebeye, which Horowitz 
claims is now one of the most densely populated slum areas in the world. 
</P>
<P>
An Army spokesperson, while declining to comment on the content of the film, 
pointed out that in the four years since the film was shot, living conditions 
on Ebeye have "improved considerably" with new housing, new roads and better 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the 50-year lease that the Army held on its Kwajalein land had 
expired, so chieftain Handel Dribo, the ostensible hero of Horowitz's saga, 
decided to reclaim his spacious, uncrowded real estate -- which by then 
featured a golf course, swimming pools and other American amenities foreign to 
the Ebeye way of life. With no new lease in place, the United States apparently 
had no real legal recourse at the time to kick Dribo and his fellow islanders 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly had the manpower and the weapons to deal with an old man and 
his family, but I think they were in a really sticky legal situation," Horowitz 
said, "because the lease had expired. And if they threw these people out 
without any legal basis, the whole thing could have gone to court and become a 
test case -- and potentially they might have lost their $3-billion base." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, who practiced TV journalism in New Mexico but had never made a 
feature-length film before, recognized a good story in the making. "I had heard 
about this guy (Dribo) in the States and knew his story was worth telling, even 
without having met him," said Horowitz, whose educational background is in 
anthropology. "I found out about the price the islanders were paying for this 
testing, and became sort of outraged myself. That's when I decided to go over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz says he was told by the Army he would not be allowed to film the 
"occupation," which by then was two months under way. He hopped on a plane 
anyway and, calling from a pay phone in Hawaii, was finally granted permission 
to film on the Marshall Islands with the condition that he agree to later 
attend five briefings from five government agencies at the Pentagon to get the 
other side of the story. Ironically, Horowitz notes, he never was able to set 
up any of these briefings later on, despite repeated letters and phone calls to 
the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Six months into the occupation, Horowitz got the inevitable ending for his 
film, which, of course, did not involve the U.S. Army's loss of a $3-billion 
base. The bad news for Dribo came when the government of the Marshall Islands 
-- which Horowitz calls a "puppet government" funded entirely by the United 
States -- condemned all the land on which the base sits through eminent domain 
and gave the Army another 50-year lease at the same low rate, resulting in the 
removal of Marshallese by force. 
</P>
<P>
Near the documentary's end, more exasperated than enraged, Dribo -- a very 
Westernized man who expresses admiration for John Wayne and other icons of 
American culture -- has taken a not uncommon view toward the occupiers of "his" 
land: "I don't understand the Americans," he says, "because they seem to be the 
best people in the world, but they are also the worst." 
</P>
<P>
Filmmaker Horowitz claims not to understand the Americans either. He can't 
understand why not only conventional missile systems but also new "Star Wars" 
experimental anti-ballistic missiles are still being tested in the Marshall 
Islands at such a high level. He can't understand why U.S. foreign policy is 
allowed to run seemingly roughshod over native cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad. Certainly no culture is preserved and remains unchanged, but I 
think what the United States has done to the Marshall Islands is a disgrace," 
Horowitz said. "The situation at Kwajalein that's been created by the U.S. Army 
has been 40 years in the making, and it's a mess. Solving it is something the 
islanders themselves need to come to grips with. American policy needs to be 
(examined) . . . to give the islanders a better shake. I think Americans need 
to look at the effect we have when we go to other countries and exert our 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, 32, is now spending much of his time in Los Angeles, working to 
develop non-documentary feature-film projects, which also have similar global 
or environmental consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
But he is proud of what he has done with "Home on the Range," as for how it 
holds up as a good yarn as well as inspiring story of activism despite its 
downbeat denouement. "For me," Horowitz said, "the most important thing is that 
it's kind of a classic story of a man fighting the machine that I think people 
can relate to, whatever culture they're from."

'LA NEGRA ESTER' BREAKS THE MOLD; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: ROBERTO PARRA'S CELEBRATED LOVE POEM TO A PROSTITUTE BORROWS ELEMENTS 
FROM BOTH TRADITIONAL AND AVANT-GARDE THEATER.

In the year of the plebiscite, two months after Chile went to the polls on Oct. 
5, 1988, the theater world welcomed "La Negra Ester," ("The Black Ester"), a 
poem by Roberto Parra adapted for the outdoor stage by Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
People's minds changed collectively. Chile fell in love with a prostitute and 
told the world its story. Before long, the 29-member El Gran Circo Teatro was 
giving five performances a week throughout the country and taking its tale to 
festivals in London, Paris, Switzerland, Scotland, Ireland, Colombia, Argentina 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The history-making spectacle that premiered at O'Higgins Plaza in Puente Alto, 
near Santiago, will make its West Coast debut Wednesday, a month since it 
closed its Santiago season. The performance will take place in a circus tent at 
the Santa Monica Pier as part of Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a 1940s brothel in the port city of San Antonio, Perez's "La Negra 
Ester" is a love story of the poet and musician Roberto, who is racked with 
visions, and the exhibitionist prostitute La Negra Ester. Staged in the current 
avant-garde Chilean theatrical style, the celebrated production features actors 
in clownish makeup and experiments with many universal folk-theater techniques, 
including mime and commedia dell'arte. International critics have also cited 
such influences as Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said his inspiration began in 1988, with his return from Paris, where he 
had been working on a mask project at the Theatre du Soleil under Adriane 
Mnouchkine. 
</P>
<P>
In an outgrowth of his collaborations with other professional actors and 
directors and his experiments with clown techniques, Perez gave his actors the 
chance to search for their feelings and translate emotion into poetic 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
"We represent the efforts of several theater groups," Perez said. "We were not 
the only ones around; there were lots of people and actors working in 
communities doing popular theater. Those who were promoting theater as a 
reflection of what was happening to us as a society allowed the public to judge 
with a critical mind. The success of 'La Negra' is that attitude which we 
represent." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, theater had been a weapon of opposition to the Augusto Pinochet 
regime, said Chilean professor Juan Villegas, chairman of the Spanish and 
Portuguese department at UC Irvine. In 1973, the year of the Pinochet coup, 
oppositional theater sprang to life, then gradually disappeared. Playwrights 
had to ask for permission to publish their work. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was a lot of theater -- theater for small populations, educated 
theater sponsored directly by the government, and the theater of 
entertainment," Villegas said. "The story of 'La Negra Ester' came from the low 
life to the middle class, re-creating the street as site of a popular theater. 
The Chilean government did not censor the theater very much. They thought 
censorship would make theater the center of attention instead of neutralizing 
it, so from 1978 to 1990, the economy did much better and, of course, protest 
diminished." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the troupe rehearsed during afternoons and late nights in a 
drama-department warehouse at the University of Chile. Simultaneously, the 
first musical chords were composed and the idea of its staging was born. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Parra's poem, written in decimas, or 10-line stanzas, is full of the 
allusive slang for which he is known. It became a play from the desire to tell 
a story of Chile that was incidentally a love story. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Palma's staging left behind the square walls and the velvet chairs as 
"La Negra" took to the streets in the form of the circus, hoping to perform the 
history of the present. The three-hour performance is sometimes staged in a 
circus tent without a top. More often, it has been staged in parks and plazas. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of "La Negra Ester" lies somewhere between traditional stage and 
street theater. "Evidently we broke the mold with something that never was done 
before," Perez said. "It was the encounter of what the spectator wanted to see 
and what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Parra is the younger brother of the late Violeta Parra, a folk singer 
who committed suicide in 1967, and poet Nicanor Parra. If Violeta's "Gracias a 
la Vida" and the "anti-poetry" of Nicanor symbolized Chile in the late '60s and 
early '70s, Roberto's "La Negra Ester" represents the Chile of the '80s: its 
older generation caught up in nostalgia for easier times, the whole society 
burdened with unspoken sorrow and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"La Negra Ester" is filled with music, but it is not a musical in the American 
sense. The play reflects how music permeates the daily lives of the Chilean 
people. Some songs are by the Parra family, and the boleros, cuecas, tangos and 
waltzes are composed and arranged by Jorge Lobos, Guillermo Aste and Alvaro 
Henriquez. 
</P>
<P>
It was evident, producer Andres Garcia said, that the roles of La Negra Ester 
and Roberto themselves chose actors Rosa Ramirez and Boris Quercia, not vice 
versa. "In our theater, the role is the one who chooses the person to play it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The musical comedy was written in Spanish and will be performed in Spanish with 
an English synopsis provided. 
</P>
<P>
Under the provisional title "Gran Circo Teatro Presenta al Gran Circo Teatro de 
Chile," the actors are rehearsing a new play that chronicles Chilean history 
between 1969-73, set during the socialist rule of Salvador Allende, but crosses 
the past with "flashbacks to the future," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Both "La Negra Ester" and the historical work share the colorful, exaggerated, 
street-theatrical style, but "La Negra Ester" was "done at a time of democratic 
process in society, when it did not matter to Chileans if their theater talked 
about politics or not," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to remember those things in Chile's history we do not remember any 
more," Perez said. "We want to know those things that we never knew." 
</P>
<P>
"Gran Circo Teatro de Chile" will be performed Saturday and Sunday at Santa 
Monica Pier at 7 p.m.

FARM UNION TEST AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French farm union leaders will be trying to simultaneously control angry 
militants in their ranks and protect their public image as protests spread 
against lower-priced, imported livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, angry French farmers have hijacked at least 19 trucks carrying 
British and East European lambs. Last week, they slaughtered 386 live lambs on 
a truck from Scotland, throwing the carcasses into the yard of a local 
government office. But such violence has alienated celebrated animal rights 
advocate Brigitte Bardot and others. "This business of killing live animals for 
the television news turns people off," a union spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A big test comes Thursday in the central French city of Nevers, where union 
organizers plan a peaceful demonstration.

FUGNIDO, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lual Teng Atia demonstrated his learning by writing his name in the dirt with a 
stick. He shyly admitted to being 14 years old -- although he was not quite 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he come to this place, he was asked. With an expression of implacable 
gravity heartbreaking in one so young, he uttered a single word: "Riak." 
</P>
<P>
An interpreter spoke up. "That means 'disaster,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
It had been an evening three years ago. Lual was with his father and mother 
near their village in Bahr el Ghazal, a region in southern Sudan where the 
government had armed Islamic militias and given them carte blanche to wreak 
havoc among the Christian and traditional believers of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Lual saw them come in a cloud of dust, on camel and horseback, guns ready. He 
saw some of his six brothers and sisters cut down. "They were shooting at us 
all," he said. "So we all ran in different directions." 
</P>
<P>
For weeks he wandered the Sudanese bush, taking up with a growing group of boys 
just like himself. It was the dry season and food was scarce, so they ate 
leaves. Finally, after at least four months afoot, they came to safety in 
Fugnido, over the Ethiopian border. 
</P>
<P>
Fugnido is the place the Sudanese war has turned into the "boys' republic," a 
vast display of Sudan's disfranchised future. 
</P>
<P>
To call the 17,000 children now here "unaccompanied minors," in the bloodless 
terminology of international relief agencies, is to obscure the tragedy of a 
community of boys without mothers and fathers, boys who have seen their sisters 
and brothers cut down and burned alive, their very childhoods extinguished and 
their tomorrows blighted by the charge of mounted Arab militiamen brandishing 
machetes and guns. 
</P>
<P>
Every refugee story is unique and every one tragic. The boys' republic in 
Fugnido is only one on a continent of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Afghanistan, whose war has millions of people fleeing, no 
place on Earth has sent more of its people across borders in search of food, 
political asylum and physical safety. The number of Africans living in refugee 
camps is now 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Africa is the only region in the world where the refugee population continues 
to grow. Most of the reason for this can be found in the benighted eastern 
corner of the continent known as the Horn, where Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan 
are all entangled in long civil wars with no current prospect of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But no region of the continent is refugee-free: Of sub-Saharan Africa's 44 
countries, at least 33 harbor some refugees, according to figures compiled by 
the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a Washington-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, now near the end of his seventh trip to the continent, has 
made the refugee problem a principal focus of his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Rwanda and Zaire still shelter refugees from Uganda's 20-year civil war, 
which ended in 1986. Southern African countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia 
shoulder the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees from wars in 
Mozambique and Angola. An outbreak of tribal pogroms in Burundi sent nearly 
200,000 people to havens in Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania. And the matchless 
brutality of Liberia's tribally inspired civil war has sent as many as 400,000 
of that tiny country's 2.3 million people fleeing to Ivory Coast, Guinea and 
Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, no region of the world is as ill-equipped to receive and care for 
refugees as Africa. In Asia, people eluding the ruins of Vietnam and Cambodia 
make for the thriving economies of Hong Kong and Thailand; but Somalis and 
Sudanese escaping their murderous civil wars can land only in Ethiopia, the 
poorest country on earth. 
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, as elsewhere, these large populations seeking shelter create 
problems and raise difficulties for relief organizations that often appear 
insoluble. Refugees can destabilize local economies, destroy regional 
ecologies, harbor political dissidents and breed violence. Separatist armies do 
their recruiting inside the camps, sometimes provoking government troops to 
attack them. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all this, Africans have long set a model for the world in caring 
for their fleeing brothers and sisters. There have been relatively few 
instances of forced repatriation or rejection by African countries. 
</P>
<P>
The world standard of humanitarian behavior must be that set by Malawi, one of 
the very poorest countries of Africa, a landlocked and deprived sliver nestled 
within the "V" formed by Mozambique's border and governed by the dictatorial 
90-year-old President H. Kamuzu Banda. 
</P>
<P>
Malawi has signed none of the international compacts governing the treatment of 
refugees, not even a groundbreaking 1969 convention of the Organization of 
African Unity. But with graciousness and proficiency it shelters the largest 
population of asylum-seekers anywhere on the continent and the largest anywhere 
in the world except Pakistan and Iran: 850,000 Mozambican refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Its ratio of refugees to indigenous population, more than 1-to-9, is the 
highest in the world. Malawi's gross national product is $160 per capita, but 
the refugee camps clustered around Nsanje, at the country's southern tip, are 
models of efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Africans have long recognized that the unique features of their political 
landscape and nature of their conflicts required a different standard of care 
and definition of refugees. The 1969 OAU convention went far beyond any other 
international compact, including those of the United Nations, in the breadth of 
its definition of "refugee" and the understanding of international obligations 
to protect these people. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Africa such a prolific producer of refugees? It has become something of 
a cliche to point a finger at the continent's former colonial powers for every 
one of today's failures. But in this case some blame may be due, especially for 
the maelstrom of the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
More than in any other part of the continent, the national boundaries of the 
Horn's countries were set by outsiders -- particularly British and Italians. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in West Africa, where indigenous leaders had a voice in designing 
their fledgling countries, they tended to rely on natural boundaries like 
rivers and mountain ranges that had historically separated unfriendly tribes 
with incompatible social and cultural habits. Nature may have given these 
countries the bizarre shapes of gerrymandered political districts, but with few 
exceptions it also granted them lasting political stability. 
</P>
<P>
Not so on the far side of the continent. The national boundaries of the 
countries of the Horn were drawn by straightedge at international conferences 
in Europe. Dinka and Nuer tribesmen landed on both sides of the Ethiopia-Sudan 
border, Somalis were found not only in the Somalilands of Britain and Italy but 
deep in Kenya and Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
This situation aggravates the natural difficulties of making stable states out 
of the destitute lands and mobile populations of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"African states have rather fluid borders," observes Kingsley Amaning, a 
Ghanaian official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). "Locals 
question whether they should be in some other state, and central governments 
can't pay for services to pacify them. In the Horn, also, people are mostly 
nomads, so the idea of settling in any state is an alien one." 
</P>
<P>
In a region of great want, it is almost inevitable that refugees tend to settle 
in places of meager resources that challenge the capacity of the outside world 
to reach and care for them. Nowhere is this more true than a forsaken stretch 
of desert in eastern Ethiopia that has become a battleground between the UNHCR 
and its multiplying army of critics, who include diplomatic observers and many 
international assistance agencies. 
</P>
<P>
This area, surrounding a tiny village called Hartisheik, was a graceless 
wasteland vacant of vegetation and water in 1988 when hundreds of thousands of 
Somalis emerged into it, fleeing the government's bombing of the northern 
cities of Hargeisa and Berbera. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other African refugees, these people were mostly urbanites, civil 
servants and businessmen, some of whom arrived briefcases in hand, with their 
wives and children trailing behind them. Only 5% of Hartisheik's refugees were 
farmers in their old country. 
</P>
<P>
They had held onto their homes until the last moment, as the government of 
Mohammed Siad Barre, a member of the Marehan clan, made war on the Issak people 
of northern Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
"Siad Barre's people would come at night and put Issak in jails indefinitely," 
recalled Mohammed Esa Mahamoud, a member of Hartisheik's refugee committee. 
"There would be no court." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Hartisheik is a trip through the land God gave to Cain. One reaches 
the camp by a 55-mile dirt road from the nearest Ethiopian town, Jijiga, 
through an unpopulated landscape blasted dry by the sun, where the only motion 
visible comes from an occasional camel and the clouds of rusty dust raised by 
water tankers and the off-road vehicles of international aid agencies. 
</P>
<P>
At length you arrive at Hartisheik town, an agglomeration of sorry mud and 
wattle structures situated midway between the vast camps of Hartisheik "A" and 
"B." There is an astonishing flurry of activity here in the middle of the 
inhospitable desert. Vendors hawk fruits and vegetables unavailable in the 
rationed diet provided by UNHCR. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year Hartisheik became a model of what can go wrong in a refugee 
camp. Its relatively affluent and urbanized refugees had arrived well-fed and 
in good health; under the UNHCR's care, malnutrition among the children 
skyrocketed to levels nearly matching those of the worst of the infamous 
Ethiopian famine of 1984-85. The agency's food-delivery system was so 
inadequate that as many as a third of the refugees were placed on half-rations, 
and there were riots over the meager water supply. An outbreak of scurvy, a 
debilitating vitamin deficiency disease seen almost nowhere else in the world, 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Rarely can a population with such considerable initial human and material 
resources have been reduced to so pitiful a state while technically under 
international protection," a team from Save the Children wrote in a blistering 
assessment last year. The team acknowledged that "exceptional political and 
logistical difficulties" existed for UNHCR, but concluded that "this tragic 
outcome was, in our view, largely avoidable." 
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials consider themselves trapped with a no-win task; indeed, it is 
sometimes hard to see how anyone could have managed in the Ethiopian wilderness 
without problems. Agency officials complain that they get little credit for 
erecting a camp for 340,000 refugees out of solid dust. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what these critics expected to find in a refugee camp in the 
middle of the desert," says Kalenga Lutato, the Zambian who is UNHCR camp 
coordinator at Hartisheik. "Water in this place is like gold." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in some ways Hartisheik has the slim advantage of being a place where 
there is little local competition for resources, however scarce they are. On 
the other side of the country, Fugnido's 76,000 refugees and another estimated 
240,000 in the giant camp of Itang have fairly overwhelmed the local population 
of 137,000 living around the provincial center of Gambela. 
</P>
<P>
Some refugee experts consider a place like Gambela to be a perfect breeding 
ground for conflicts between the indigenous population and the refugees -- 
always a problem in destitute areas. For one thing, the area has been literally 
overrun by refugees, who have quadrupled the local population. 
</P>
<P>
"The refugees get some support, but resources for the nationals are slim," says 
Kingsley Amaning of UNHCR. "The refugees have better clinics and a better water 
supply." Fugnido camp, for instance, has 23 holes (drilled by UNICEF) to supply 
clean drinking water; the local population outside the camp must make do with 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Aggravating the crisis is the increasing penury of UNHCR. In past years, when 
its $400-million budget applied to a worldwide caseload of 5 million refugees, 
the agency put a lot of money into projects that would benefit refugees and 
their hosts alike. These included improving the local infrastructure of roads 
and services. There were also development programs to move people into 
"revenue-raising activities," UNHCR-speak for small gardens, weaving, pottery, 
and so on, which would make them more self-sufficient and ease the strain on 
local resources. To some extent this approach provided a positive incentive to 
locals for welcoming refugees, even if their large numbers tended to disturb a 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
But with the same UNHCR budget now spread thinly over a clientele of 15 million 
refugees, all of those programs have ceased. "Now we just have enough money for 
basic assistance and life-saving programs -- but just for refugees," says 
Amaning. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict is intensified by the despoliation of the local ecology. 
</P>
<P>
"Just five years ago, this entire area was so thickly forested you couldn't see 
from here to there," remarks Mathias Temesgen, an official of the Ethiopian 
Administration for Refugee Affairs, as he waves his hand over an empty, lightly 
grassed landscape dotted with dying bushes. The region was so rich in wildlife, 
especially elephants, that it attracted affluent foreign hunters as one of 
Ethiopia's few tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees have ranged over the land, cutting down trees 
for fuel, denuding the dales and hillocks so thoroughly that Itang has suffered 
something no one can remember ever happening before -- extensive flooding 
during the rainy season. No one has seen an elephant in several years. 
</P>
<P>
For now, relief agencies and the Ethiopian government do what they can to mold 
the refugees, especially the children, into a community. As many children as 
can fit through the low doors of the classroom huts are given lessons in 
English, Arabic and mathematics, although books and paper are as highly prized 
here as water is in Hartisheik. Even with two shifts a day, 3,000 children 
still must go without any schooling at all. 
</P>
<P>
In the empty days they wash their clothes in a nearby river, or kick a 
makeshift soccer ball around the dry fields between the huts. The adults around 
the camp watch them with concern, for these children who escaped the murderous 
militias of Sudan are the flimsy repositories of the country's hopes. Many more 
were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was escape or die," remembers Elijah Alier, a former telecommunications 
engineer from Bahr el Ghazal who recalls his own family's escape to Fugnido 
with the dryness of detail that submerges grief. People were being shot on the 
street and rounded up by night, he remembers. On the day he left, he collected 
his wife and two of his children, ages 2 and 4. His third child was off playing 
with friends, and there was no time to find him. He was 6 then, three years 
ago. There has been no word of his fate from a land where children were being 
captured and killed or enslaved by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"He was picked up by another family," Alier says quietly, "if he was lucky."

Here on the historic streets where the Russian monarchy fell and Soviet 
Communism first took command, there is a grass-roots call to restore the city's 
original name. 
</P>
<P>
"The people want to change the name back to St. Petersburg because we are 
returning to our history and to the spirit of Russia," Lyubov B. Krasilnikova, 
40, an engineer, said as she walked out of a long-neglected church which is now 
reopened and undergoing renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"It means more to us to be Russians than it did before, and we're trying to 
bring back the personality of Russia. This includes restoring the old names." 
</P>
<P>
Many historic names are being revived in the Soviet Union these days as its 
people, disappointed with seven decades of Communist rule, seek to recover 
their proud past. 
</P>
<P>
To put their stamp on the country's history, Communist leaders replaced 
traditional names for cities, towns and streets with names honoring their own 
heroes, many of whom were later discredited. 
</P>
<P>
Cities named for the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev and Mikhail I. Kalinin, 
a Bolshevik leader, have already reverted to their historic names. Most 
recently, Moscow's main shopping avenue, Gorky Street, was given back its 
historic name, Tverskaya Street. 
</P>
<P>
But the battle to change the name of Leningrad is more complicated. For 
decades, Soviet people have been taught to revere V.I. Lenin, the leader of the 
1917 Bolshevik Revolution and founding father of the modern Soviet state. Until 
recently any criticism of Lenin was considered political heresy. 
</P>
<P>
That's changing now, particularly in the country's non-Russian republics. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things the Lithuanians did in their drive for independence was 
to take Lenin's name off the main street in the capital, Vilnius, and replace 
it with the name of a historic Lithuanian hero. 
</P>
<P>
In Tbilisi, the capital of the southern republic of Georgia, Lenin was stricken 
from the name of a polytechnic institute, and cheering crowds greeted the 
removal of a huge statue of him in the city's main square last week. 
</P>
<P>
In Chervonograd, a city in the western Ukraine, authorities also took down a 
monument to Lenin early last month. And Lenin statues have been vandalized in 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Moscow, a bust of Lenin was first turned to face the wall of the City 
Council building, then finally removed altogether last month. And there is open 
discussion of removing Lenin's preserved corpse from the famous tomb on Red 
Square and giving it a conventional burial. 
</P>
<P>
But to change the name of the city where Lenin's revolution triumphed? Where 
his image is ubiquitous? Where one rides the Lenin subway to Lenin Station and 
emerges on Lenin Square? 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to change the name of Gorky Street, it's another thing to 
change the name of a city named after Lenin," said Boris N. Nikolsky, editor of 
Neva, a literary and political journal here. 
</P>
<P>
Czar Peter I, known as Peter the Great, founded the city in a swampy area on 
the Neva River in 1703. He named it after his patron saint and directed the 
construction of a grand European city with baroque architecture, picturesque 
canals and beautiful vistas -- a "window to the West." 
</P>
<P>
It remained St. Petersburg until 1914, when the name was deemed too Germanic 
for the capital of a country then at war with Germany. It became Petrograd, and 
remained so until 1924, when, after Lenin's death, the city was renamed once 
more in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Leningrad's Communist Party leadership is in the forefront of 
those opposed to changing it back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against changing the name of the city," Yuri P. Belov, a secretary of the 
Leningrad regional Communist Party committee, said in an interview. "I think it 
would offend the honor of the generation that lived through the tragic and 
historic past of Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenin never thought about having a city named for him," Belov continued. "But 
the thing is, the city was named after him because he personified the ideal of 
justice in society to the people. The decision to name the city after him was 
made by the people, not by the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist leadership is not alone in wanting to preserve the name 
Leningrad, the only official name most locals have ever known for their city. 
</P>
<P>
"The name St. Petersburg would sound strange to me -- I've always lived in 
Leningrad," said Vladimir I. Vasiliyev, 40, an economist for the government's 
planning office. 
</P>
<P>
"The name Leningrad is connected with the revolution that Lenin led, and we 
have not yet given up on that revolution." 
</P>
<P>
A 72-year-old homemaker, who lived through the World War II siege of the city 
and who remembers Lenin from her childhood, said she opposes any change. 
</P>
<P>
"We are used to calling this city Leningrad in honor of Lenin because he was a 
great leader," she said as she stood in a long line at a grocery store. "Of 
course, changing the name would be a great insult to Lenin's memory." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of reviving the original name take issue with such arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the city's name was changed to Leningrad in 1924 because of a call by 
the working people, but in reality it was an administrative act," argued Gleb 
S. Lebedev, chairman of the Leningrad City Council's committee on culture, 
during a recent program on Leningrad television. 
</P>
<P>
"A decision to return the historic name of Leningrad would be legal and 
correct," Lebedev contended. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that Lenin himself would have supported the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not offend Lenin," said Yelena V. Palamarchik, 28, a structural 
engineer. "It's well known that Lenin himself was against such things (as 
excessive honors). He was a very modest man." 
</P>
<P>
While he was alive, Lenin made it clear that he did not want to be an idol. 
After his death, his widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, fought in vain to prevent his 
name and image from being idolized. 
</P>
<P>
"Krupskaya said Lenin was against a cult -- of his name or his personality," 
Vladimir K. Arro, a playwright and chairman of the Leningrad City Council's 
committee on glasnost and the media, commented in an interview. "She said the 
best memorial to Lenin would be a developed socialist society, not his likeness 
on statues or his name on buildings and streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Restoring the original name would not insult the name of Lenin, but restore 
historic justice." 
</P>
<P>
But Arro conceded that the name change will be difficult for many people, 
especially for those like himself who lived through the World War II siege and 
the other difficult, but proud, times in the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people will feel emotional loss if the name is changed -- even I," 
Arro said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those who take a position somewhere between the two poles. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Igor V. Lysenko, director of the Fund for the Revival of Leningrad, 
argue that St. Petersburg is "too pretentious a name. It was the name of a 
capital of an empire. And it does not sound Russian at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those people advocate a compromise: a return to the name Petrograd. 
</P>
<P>
Still others like the original name of the city but contend that in its current 
condition, with its buildings blackened from pollution and crumbling from age 
and neglect, it does not deserve to be called St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not be right to return the name of the city, when it looks as bad as 
it does right now," said Natalya N. Sidorova, public relations director for the 
Fund for the Revival of Leningrad. "St. Petersburg is too beautiful a name for 
a city in such bad repair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should first try to restore it to look a little more like it did . 
. . then we should bring back the old name." 
</P>
<P>
The question of restoring the name is nevertheless being debated by members of 
the Leningrad City Council, and advocates of the change predict it is only a 
matter of time before it is proposed officially. 
</P>
<P>
And while the debate goes on, the name St. Petersburg is becoming more common 
among the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
A rock 'n' roll group and some independent newspapers are using the original 
name. St. Petersburg pins can be bought at newspaper stands. And a new club of 
young intellectuals in the city calls itself the University of St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
"Piter," the city's old slang name, which has never totally died out, is now 
heard regularly on some local television shows. 
</P>
<P>
There is an old Soviet joke about this city. For obvious reasons, it is making 
the rounds again: 
</P>
<P>
An old man is called to the local police station for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were you born?" an officer asks. 
</P>
<P>
"In St. Petersburg," the man replies. 
</P>
<P>
"Where did you go to school?" the officer asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Petrograd," the man replies. 
</P>
<P>
"Were do you live?" the officer asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Leningrad," the man says. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you want to live?" the officer questions. 
</P>
<P>
The man sighs. "St. Petersburg."

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall, slim man in the comfortable corner office on the ground floor of La 
Moneda, Chile's historical government house, has materialized there like a time 
traveler from long ago. His name, Edgardo Boeninger, has a familiar ring, 
echoing the faded urgency of bygone newscasts, resounding with the drama of 
past struggles for power. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years have passed since a military coup interrupted Chilean 
democracy, ejecting Boeninger and others from the nucleus of national life. 
Now, many have returned to the thick of things; their names reign once more in 
the headlines as they wield the trappings of office. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among them, of course, is Patricio Aylwin, chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Party at the time of the 1973 coup and now Chile's elected civilian 
president. Then there are former congressmen, former ministers, longtime party 
leaders and other figures from the past who are among the people Aylwin relies 
on to help run the revived democracy. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the president relies on no one more than Boeninger, 65, whose 
official title is "minister secretary general of the presidency." A kind of 
right-hand man to Aylwin, he is a prime example of the political veteran who 
has bridged the gap of time and military rule to assume a key position in the 
new democratic order. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Boeninger played a major role in formulating the political strategy 
that carried the country through a remarkably smooth transition from military 
to civilian rule. In his ministerial position, he is a combination chief of 
staff, strategist, trouble-shooter and mediator whose intellectual prowess is 
sometimes said to make him indispensable to the president. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that he is the closest adviser and the one the 
president pays most attention to," said an opposition politician. 
</P>
<P>
"Aylwin would not be viable without Boeninger," commented another politician 
who has known both men for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans recall other, more turbulent times when Boeninger's formidable 
political skills were in play. In 1973, before the coup, the chants of marching 
youths and clouds of tear gas often rose over Santiago streets as rival 
political parties contended for power at the University of Chile. Boeninger was 
at the center of the fray as the university's elected rector. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of conservative parties and center-straddling Christian 
Democrats, he had won university elections three times in the previous four 
years, defeating leftist forces that supported Chilean President Salvador 
Allende, a socialist. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a recent interview if he was against the coup on Sept. 11, 1973, 
Boeninger said he "shared the feeling that the situation had come to a point of 
crisis beyond return" but favored another solution. "We were working on the 
proposal that both the president and Parliament resign, to have elections all 
over again, to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Although Boeninger was deeply involved in the political process at the time, he 
did not belong to a party. After the coup, he joined the Christian Democrats, 
just as the military junta, led by army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, banned all 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the last man to be admitted into a political party," Boeninger recalled. 
"I requested the president of the party at the time, which precisely was 
Patricio Aylwin, to admit me into the party. . . . It was my way of protesting 
the shutting down of the political system by the military." 
</P>
<P>
When the new regime intervened in the university administration, Boeninger 
resigned his post as rector, abruptly ending that phase of his career in public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of prominent Chileans, Boeninger comes from German stock. His 
father, a white-collar worker, immigrated to Chile from Germany after World War 
I, and his mother was also of German descent. 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger attended some of Santiago's best secondary schools, then earned a 
degree in civil engineering at the Catholic University of Chile. He taught 
calculus and analytical geometry at the Catholic University School of 
Engineering for two years before serving for a decade as Santiago's first 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he completed a degree in business and economics at the University of 
Chile, where he became dean of economics in 1959. Under President Eduardo Frei, 
from 1964 to 1969, Boeninger was the national budget director. He was elected 
rector of the University of Chile in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1973 coup, he worked as a consultant to international organizations 
such as the United Nations and the World Bank. In 1975, he spent half a year at 
UCLA teaching a seminar and studying political science. 
</P>
<P>
He continued to study social sciences at private Chilean research institutions, 
"trying to sort of bring together economic thinking and political thinking," he 
said. "And that got me gradually involved in, first of all, bridging the gap of 
people who had been on different sides of the fence in the previous political 
conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
As a Christian Democrat, Boeninger formed a close association with Patricio 
Aylwin and became a party vice president in 1987. Boeninger is often credited 
with devising the formula for an intricate alliance between the Christian 
Democrats and other parties, including the socialists, that won the elections 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Using a favorite engineering metaphor, he told The Times that his earlier work 
in think tanks with both leftists and conservatives had helped prepare him for 
his political role. 
</P>
<P>
"I had helped build the initial bridges, so it was easy for me to make a 
contribution in doing this same bridge-building thing now in the political 
field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Genaro Arriagada, a vice president of the Christian Democratic Party, said it 
was also Boeninger's strategy that won struggles within the party and within 
the electoral alliance to give Aylwin the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"The mastermind of that was Boeninger," said Arriagada. As a result, he said, 
Boeninger took his pick of posts in the administration that began March 11. 
</P>
<P>
"He is perhaps the only Aylwin minister who could choose for himself where he 
would be," Arriagada said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Boeninger "profoundly analytical, rational" and "morally impeccable," 
capable of resisting pressure but bent on avoiding conflicts that could 
jeopardize the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Otero, a vice president of the conservative National Renovation Party, 
described Boeninger as "muy simpatico," but calculatedly so. 
</P>
<P>
"Boeninger never loses his calm, never," Otero said. "He knows exactly where he 
is going and how, and he uses all of the charm in his power to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger said an important part of his job is to mediate between parties and 
the government, between the Congress and the government and between ministries 
within the government. On a bookshelf, within his reach as he spoke in his La 
Moneda office, was a book entitled "The Resolution of Conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger is a voluminous reader. "I read all sorts of novels," he said. Once 
he favored authors of Latin America's literary "boom" generation of the 1960s, 
such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but lately he has been exploring Japanese and 
Egyptian literature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also relaxes with jogging and Ping-Pong. "I'm fond of the theater, I'm fond 
of the movies, I like to dance," he added. "I've never been bored in my life. 
Too many things interest me." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Marta, have been married 22 years. He has two grown children 
from a previous marriage and she has four. 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger makes a distinction between his political and private lives. "His 
house is not the politician's house where everyone comes," said Christian 
Democrat Arriagada. "His friends come, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
What Boeninger does most, however, is work, according to those who know him. He 
is capable, according to the newsmagazine Hoy, "of working until 2 in the 
morning and returning to work at 8 a.m. with a memo ready containing a proposal 
for solving the problem under discussion." 
</P>
<P>
A major problem faced by the administration Boeninger serves is what to do 
about human rights violations that took place under Pinochet's military 
government. Many Chileans want punishment for violators, but others, including 
Pinochet, oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of human rights is the only one in which you cannot expect to reach 
a consensus," Boeninger said. "What you can do is ride a narrow path to finally 
get to what I call the grudging acceptance of all the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
"What does that really mean? That the expectations of punishment for violators 
of human rights will be limited. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said Chileans will have to accept a small number of human rights trials for 
crimes that took place after 1978. Violations before that are pardoned by an 
amnesty, decreed under Pinochet's regime. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not try to change the amnesty law," Boeninger said. "We think that 
would produce a conflict hardly manageable." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger predicted that the armed forces will not interfere with the 
government's overriding goal of consolidating democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the authoritarian temptation is any risk now in this 
country," he said. "I don't think that anyone believes that there could be a 
regression to any kind of authoritarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
When the current four-year term is over, Boeninger will end his public service 
career and do some writing, he said. "I plan to try to write my vision of the 
events of Chile from 1973 to 1993."

SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA, El Salvador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each morning the residents of this ramshackle hill town are rattled from their 
beds by the clatter of men preparing for war. First the bugle, then the 
rhythmic stomping of marching boots followed by the shouts of officers calling 
out commands. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn call to arms is for the 4th Detachment of the Salvadoran army's 3rd 
Brigade, one of the government's front-line units in the decade-long civil war 
against the Marxist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
As the newly risen sun begins to throw shadows across the valley to the east, 
the troopers form up in front of their fortress headquarters, armed and dressed 
for battle. Standing beneath a sign decorated by four-foot-tall letters 
proclaiming "Welcome to the 4th Detachment," they sing the national anthem and 
repeatedly shout their unit's slogan: "Commando! There is no mission 
impossible!" 
</P>
<P>
That may be so on television, but the anxious twitches of widened eyes, the 
clenched jaws, the suspicious glares directed at peasants gathering for the 
opening of the marketplace and the 4th Detachment's inability to defeat a 
smaller enemy force all betray the bravado of the 2,000 government troopers 
based in this rebel-infested area of northern Morazan province. 
</P>
<P>
There is much to be nervous about. In the last three months, the 4th Detachment 
commandos have fought the FMLN guerrillas at least 60 times, most of the 
clashes the result of rebel ambushes and attacks. Casualties were high. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the war is considered to be in a lull after last November's FMLN offensive 
-- a lull nearly everyone feels will soon end, someplace, in another guerrilla 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
The drop-off in the conflict coincided with a round of U.N.-sponsored peace 
talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire -- talks that have so far floundered on 
FMLN demands for a cut in government security forces and a restructuring of the 
military command. 
</P>
<P>
The government high command ordered all of its 57,000 men on full alert two 
months ago as a mixture of rumors, intelligence reports and the failure of 
peace talks reinforced the fear of another massive FMLN action. 
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists," said Lt. Col. Oscar Alberto Leon Linares, the 4th Detachment 
commander, referring to the FMLN, "are preparing for another offensive. It 
could come any time until the end of December. We are waiting for it." 
</P>
<P>
What they are waiting for is less than 20 miles to the north in the war-scarred 
village of Perquin. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla forces, many dressed in the same uniforms as their army enemies and 
carrying the same arms, also prepare to fight, assembling under a street wide 
banner proclaiming "Welcome to Morazan, an Expression of Emerging Power." 
</P>
<P>
Although fewer in numbers and equipment, the guerrillas appear far more relaxed 
than their army counterparts, knowing they have the strategic advantage of 
determing when and where the next battle will be fought. They also benefit from 
dedicated support from the local population, all of which led the rebel troops 
to take time out to play soccer on a recent Sunday even as government troops 
ventured nervously into the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be another offensive," said a local FMLN leader who goes by the 
pseudonym Fito, "and we will pay back the army for all they have done to us." 
</P>
<P>
The Morazan scenario is repeated throughout this edgy country. 
</P>
<P>
In the narrow valleys and up the rutted and craggy sides of the Cerro el Tigre 
mountain in the eastern province of Usulutan, the occupying army belongs to the 
FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas own the area. They patrol the roads, run civil services, 
organize the population and carry out extensive training exercises, all within 
a 30-minute drive of government troops who leave their garrisons only for 
short-range patrols. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day when journalists reached the area, the government army had 
tried to venture into the countryside only to be ambushed in three different 
locations. Neither side's casualty reports can be believed, but there were many 
government dead and wounded and the patrols have been halted. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready," said one guerrilla militia member guarding a rebel headquarters 
near Santiago de Maria, a village where the walls are festooned with pro-FMLN 
graffiti. "We have been resupplied and our logistics are in place. We can go at 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
In the capital of San Salvador, where the guerrillas staged their largest 
attack last autumn and where they were able to control large sections -- 
including some of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods -- for several days, 
darkened tanks patrol the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers have set up outposts throughout the city, leaving a litter of ration 
tins and other trash in front of luxury houses. In spite of these precautions, 
and even though many analysts doubt that the next offensive will be in the 
capital, residents are nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"People are leaving and want to make some money at the same time by renting 
their homes," said one agent who asked not to be named. "But nobody wants to 
take the chance. So I am offering large homes at half their price and still 
nobody wants them." 
</P>
<P>
While the FMLN claims that a new offensive would be aimed at gaining government 
concessions at the peace talks, some analysts think the guerrillas still feel 
they can so badly defeat the army that they can make major political gains 
aimed at forcing out the government of President Alfredo Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, said one diplomat, the guerrillas are trying to provoke the 
government to break off the negotiations, giving the FMLN an excuse to launch 
another round of attacks without facing international condemnation for 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The last FMLN proposal to totally disarm both forces "was a giant step 
backward," said one diplomat, adding that intelligence sources indicate the 
five FMLN commanders had "made a hard decision to go the military route one 
more time." 
</P>
<P>
Other information, he said, shows the guerrillas "are going beyond expanding 
stockpiles and logistics. They are moving people. . . . Our worst fears are 
confirmed. . . . I think the decision has been taken." 
</P>
<P>
The next questions are where and when the anticipated guerrilla effort will 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be an offensive as before," said the diplomat. The rebels are more 
likely "to concentrate their forces against selected targets in an effort to 
embarrass the military." 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat with good contacts with both the army and the FMLN agreed. 
"It is likely they will step up military action but nothing as spectacular as 
last fall. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I think they will concentrate on the air force and economic targets," 
using newly obtained Soviet-made SAM-13 surface-to-air missiles to offset the 
army's jet fighters and helicopter gunships. 
</P>
<P>
The estimates as to when the offensive will begin range from now until the end 
of December with the consensus holding for mid-October. This would allow time 
for renewed negotiations afterward, the results of which could be applied 
before national elections next March.

<TEXT>
<P>
His troops were on alert, his vacation plans ruined, and the strain of nightly 
false alarms showed on his face. But the brigadier general laughed as he put 
down his phone. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my third newspaper call today," he told his visitor. "Everyone wants 
to know if the coup has started." 
</P>
<P>
Manila's latest round of coup rumors have rattled this weary city, not least 
because daily headlines have trumpeted 21 "terror" bombings, insisted that 
long-loyal military leaders plotted a "palace coup," and repeatedly speculated 
that President Corazon Aquino would resign, be assassinated or impose martial 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The explosions caused no serious damage or injuries, and none of the rumors 
proved true. But the fear they generated has focused attention on a 
little-known, fast-growing faction of disgruntled junior officers in the 
Philippine military called the Young Officers Union, or YOU. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the YOU is the latest -- and perhaps greatest -- threat to 
Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Top military officials who long denied the group's existence now blame it for 
the August bombing spree, as well as for a sophisticated disinformation 
campaign that spread false reports via phone and fax. Officials also concede 
that the impatient young officers played a key role in last December's 
attempted coup and may well lead the next. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the wave of the future," said Jose T. Almonte, a retired general and 
counterintelligence chief with close links to the rebel movement. "And time is 
on their side." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, they appear to be a new breed of rebel in the Philippines. 
Although the group is an offshoot of the rightist Reform the Armed Forces 
Movement, or RAM, its young officers call themselves the non-Communist Left. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews and manifestoes, they espouse an often-contradictory ideology 
that calls for a "national revolution" to free the country of feudalism, 
poverty and foreign domination. They especially stress "Filipinism," a 
nationalist movement popular in the 1930s, when the nation was an American 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
Vague promises of land reform and social justice sound like those of the 
outlawed Communist New Peoples' Army. Indeed, the YOU has offered to join 
forces with the NPA if the latter renounces communism. While that's unlikely, 
analysts say the YOU is the first military faction to reach out for mass 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"They're more likely to compete for the same ground than to collaborate," said 
Francisco Nemenzo, a University of the Philippines chancellor who has studied 
both groups. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the YOU has adopted Communist-style jargon and organization. It builds 
"cells," coordinates "plenums," and holds "self-criticism sessions." It seeks 
civilian fronts, recruiting among students, labor and other groups. And it 
claims 198 "collectives" with three to seven members each. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials scoff, saying they've identified only 40 core members in an 
officer corps of nearly 15,000. "But we really don't know exactly how big it 
is," says Rafael Ileto, head of the National Security Council. "It's one of 
those nebulous things. It's more a movement than an organization." 
</P>
<P>
One senior officer said the group has a strong appeal, however. "How can we 
fight nationalism?" he asked. "How can we fight Filipinism? It is very 
difficult. . . . The majority of my men are probably sympathizers." 
</P>
<P>
By its own account, the YOU was secretly launched in August, 1988, by six 
captains and lieutenants disillusioned with the fugitive colonels and generals 
leading RAM. The so-called Ramboys helped bring Aquino to power in 1986 but 
then tried and failed six times to overthrow her. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent attempt, rebel junior officers of the Scout Ranger Regiment, 
an elite army commando unit, took over Manila's Makati financial district as 
the coup was collapsing, trapping thousands of terrified tourists and residents 
for five days. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials now say the leaders of that siege, particularly Maj. 
Abraham Purugganan, acted without consulting senior officers in RAM who had 
organized the coup. Purugganan is now a leader of YOU. He is also a fugitive 
who carries a telephone beeper on his belt and a $40,000 price on his head. 
</P>
<P>
The group finally went public in April this year, claiming credit after 15 
hooded commandos carrying cases of beer for the wardens raided the city jail 
and freed Lt. Col. Billy Bibit, a key coup plotter. Military officials suspect 
that Bibit, now in the underground, has directed the Manila bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos denounced the YOU as either a 
phantom organization or a RAM-controlled political front designed to revive 
RAM's sagging credibility. If so, the YOU has consciously rejected much of 
RAM's style. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike RAM's well-known and flamboyant fugitive leader, Gregorio (Gringo) 
Honasan, all YOU spokesmen and leaders use the same anonymous nom de guerre: 
"Capt. Carlos Maglalang." In a May meeting with Philippine reporters, all six 
ostensible rebels identified themselves as Carlos Maglalang. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to avoid a cult of personality," said one local reporter who 
attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike RAM, the YOU warns it will "conduct military actions" to force the 
United States to close military bases in the Philippines. Some diplomats 
suspect they were responsible for grenade attacks earlier this year on a U.S. 
Embassy residential compound and a U.S. Information Service library, both in 
Manila. Damage was slight and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the YOU has mostly recruited 1978 to 1988 graduates of the 
Philippine Military Academy, which is modeled after West Point. They are under 
age 35 and mostly below the rank of major. That makes them too young to be 
tainted, as RAM leaders are, for having enforced Draconian martial-law decrees 
for former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a generation gap," said Nemenzo. "I think there is a process 
of alienation from RAM. But their links are still strong." 
</P>
<P>
At least one YOU recruiting session was held in the officers club at Camp 
Aguinaldo, headquarters of the Defense Department, according to testimony 
before a presidential commission studying last December's failed coup. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Erasto L. Sanchez, commander of a paramilitary police station south of 
Manila, told the panel that a fellow PMA graduate tried to recruit him at his 
house last October. He said officers were targeted "if they think . . . you 
are, shall we say, subversive minded." 
</P>
<P>
While Sanchez said he did not join, a young Scout Ranger patrolling recently on 
a provincial road north of Manila clearly had. He had penned his sympathies in 
large letters on the canvas top of his boots: "Makati Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
Asked where he was during the December siege, he replied, "I was a sniper in 
the Twin Towers," a plush condominium complex. Asked about his current plans, 
he grinned under his dark Ray-Bans and fingered the grenades on his belt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for the next one," he said.

MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF COUPLE; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECT: A 24-YEAR-OLD FROM BELLFLOWER WILL BE ARRAIGNED TODAY ON CHARGES THAT 
HE RAN OVER TWO YOUNG CAMPERS SLEEPING IN THEIR TENT AT SAN ONOFRE STATE PARK.

<P>
A 24-year-old Bellflower man arrested in connection with the weekend deaths of 
two teen-age campers at San Onofre State Park will be arraigned today on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving, felony hit and run and two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After police tracked down the license-plate number on the 1967 Ford Mustang 
left at the scene, Douglas John Freels was arrested at his home about seven 
hours after the incident, which investigators believe occurred at 2:30 a.m. 
Sunday, Oceanside CHP Officer Jerry Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers immediately took Freels to a hospital near his home for a 
blood-alcohol test, Bohrer said. Results will not be available for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Motor Vehicles spokeswoman said Freels has no record of other 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
Freels was being held in the Vista Detention Facility on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, park officials said Graham Jacob Grubb, 18, of Laguna Niguel and his 
girlfriend, Amanda Jocon Ciskowski, 19, of San Diego, who apparently were run 
over as they slept, had pitched their tent in a parking lot next to their car, 
in an area not designated as a campsite. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Long, lifeguard supervisor for the Pendleton Coast District, which 
oversees San Onofre State Park, said the couple evidently entered the park 
sometime after the day-use lot closed at 10 p.m. and, finding the campsites 
full, pitched their pup tent in the parking lot at the southern end of the 
park, which was otherwise deserted. 
</P>
<P>
He said that ranger vehicles patrol all the parks at night and that rangers, 
had they seen the couple camped in the parking lot, would have asked them to 
leave. The last patrol passed the area where they were camped, about a quarter 
of a mile past the designated campsites, shortly after midnight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Long, who was called to the accident scene on Sunday morning, has worked at the 
park for 12 years. He recalled at least one other fatal accident involving 
overnight campers in the parking lot struck by motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy," he said of Sunday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said a passenger in the Mustang, identified as John Herrera 
of Downey, was questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
Bohrer said the suspect and his passenger were traveling north at about 30 
m.p.h. through the 500-space, day-use parking lot that is bisected by old 
Highway 101 before it ends in a cul-de-sac about six miles south of Basilone 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Long said the Mustang apparently veered off the narrow two-lane road into the 
ocean side of the parking lot and struck the tent where Grubb and Ciskowski 
were sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
The driver ran over the couple, struck the rear of Grubb's vehicle and dragged 
the victims' bodies under the rear wheels for about 35 feet before coming to a 
stop, Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and his passenger then fled to a pay telephone and called a cab to 
take them home, officers said. Police said Freels told them that he and Herrera 
had earlier been to Capistrano Beach and San Clemente and were "just going for 
a drive" through the state park. 
</P>
<P>
"(The bodies) were still there when we arrived," Bohrer said, adding that 
Freels told officers that "he felt like he hit something but didn't know what 
it was. He said he walked to the front of the vehicle . . . but he doesn't 
remember much." 
</P>
<P>
Freels, one of five children, lives at home with his family, investigators and 
neighbors said. A man who answered the telephone at the family's Bellflower 
home said, "We don't really want to talk about it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Casillas, who has lived next door to the Freels family for eight years, 
described Douglas Freels as a "very good person." 
</P>
<P>
"He never caused trouble or made any noise," Casillas said. She added that his 
parents apparently did not know of the fatalities when their son was picked up 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
"My son went over there and asked (Freels') mother what happened when the 
police came," Casillas said. "His mother said (Freels) didn't explain anything 
to her. She just knew that he came back from San Diego and was in an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Hanks, who has lived across the street from the family for 14 years, 
said Freels is a quiet person who spends much of his time at home and stays out 
of trouble. Hanks said the beige-colored Mustang Freels drove on Sunday is one 
of two that Freels' father had refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' families said they have not yet decided when to hold planned 
memorial services for the two. 
</P>
<P>
Ciskowski's father, John Ciskowski of San Diego, said about Freels' arrest: "He 
should be made to pay, but he is already in trouble. I'm sure he's hurting 
badly already." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier accounts of the accident said Grubb's Toyota land cruiser was hurled 
180 feet, but Bohrer said the impact merely spun the vehicle around 180 
degrees.

STUDY TO CONSIDER WIDENING USE OF CAR-POOL LANES; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: THE IDEA WOULD BE TO ENTICE COMMUTERS TO DRIVE THE FREEWAYS BEFORE AND 
AFTER PEAK HOURS, WHEN THE HIGH-OCCUPANCY LANES WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL.

<P>
Orange County's car-pool lanes, long a point of controversy among beleaguered 
commuters, might be opened to all cars during non-peak hours if a study 
commissioned Monday recommends pursuing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The study, to cost $10,000, was ordered Monday by the Orange County 
Transportation Commission. Chuck Fuhs, a nationally recognized expert in 
high-occupancy vehicle lane issues, will perform the study, which will look at 
how similar lanes across the country are managed. Fuhs is expected to finish 
his work in November and present the report to the OCTC before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to see is whether we can encourage single-occupant vehicles 
to use the highways in off-peak hours," said Dana Reed, the commission's 
chairman. Reed added that officials want to know if opening the lanes after 
rush hour might encourage drivers to avoid the freeway until then. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Orange County's car-pool lanes bar all vehicles with fewer than two 
occupants 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Changing that restriction could have a spillover effect on other counties and 
is not likely to be made in the near future, officials said. But the study 
could provide ammunition to one side or the other in the longstanding debate 
over high-occupancy lanes, which exist on the Costa Mesa and San Diego 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the lanes argue that they encourage car-pooling, aiding efforts 
to curb traffic and air pollution. Opponents, however, view them as an 
unnecessary obstacle to commuting and argue that they worsen traffic flow 
rather than improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Caught between those vocal constituencies, some officials have searched for a 
middle ground, so far without success. County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who 
proposed the study, said Monday that he hoped that it could help "nullify some 
of the differences that we have in the community." 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials, who have previously expressed their 
support for 24-hour car-pool lanes, eyed the study's intentions skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
"People right now are just getting used to the fact that you can't go in those 
lanes unless you have two people in the car," CHP Officer Angel Johnson said. 
"It would be much more confusing if there were certain hours when you could, 
and others when you couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Drivers for Highway Safety, an organization vehemently opposed to 
the car-pool lanes, co-chairman Bill Ward greeted news of the study with 
cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better for those lanes to be open than for them to be closed," Ward said. 
"We'd like to see them opened all day long, but most of the day is better than 
none at all." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the study were to recommend ending the 24-hour-a-day restricted access, 
the county probably could not implement it without the agreement of governments 
in neighboring counties and cities, officials said. Otherwise, they noted, open 
lanes in one county could funnel directly into restricted ones as they passed 
over local borders. Drivers would be forced to switch lanes to avoid breaking 
laws in neighboring counties, adding to confusion and possibly increasing 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We fit into a regional context," said Tom Fortune, public affairs director for 
the Transportation Commission. "Whatever we do is probably going to need to be 
part of a regional policy." 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County debates the future of its car-pool lanes, officials 
released a report Monday indicating that enforcement of the lane regulations 
has dramatically improved in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Added patrols and new signs on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways have led 
to a sharp reduction in the number of motorists violating car-pool lane 
restrictions on those highways, according to the report, prepared by the 
California Department of Transportation for the OCTC. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that the number of single-occupant cars illegally using the 
high-occupany lanes has dropped by 50% on the southbound San Diego Freeway 
since May 1, when additional Highway Patrol officers were added to the route. 
Northbound violations during the same period have dropped from 6% of the cars 
using the lane to less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the increased number of CHP officers monitoring the San Diego 
Freeway, warning signs on the Costa Mesa Freeway also seem to have cut down on 
the number of violations. 
</P>
<P>
Signs notifying drivers that they can be fined $246 for a first offense were 
posted on April 25 in several places along the Costa Mesa Freeway. Since then, 
the violation rate has dropped by more than 50%, according to the Caltrans 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Ward, however, said that passenger counts are difficult to verify, as 
they require surveyors to gauge the number of people in a car as it crosses 
beneath an overpass, often at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Ward also questioned the relevance of the numbers, noting that violations drop 
off markedly after rush hours, since the highway becomes less congested and 
motorists have less incentive to cheat.

HEAT, SMOG TO STICK AROUND; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: MORE OF THE SAME IS PREDICTED FOR TODAY, BUT AIR QUALITY EXPERTS POINT 
OUT THAT SO FAR, THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN ONE OF THE COUNTY'S LEAST SMOGGY. 
</P>

<P>
Temperatures soared into the 90s across Orange County again Monday, prompting 
some schools to cut classes short for today, and forecasters predicted more of 
the same hot, smoggy weather for today. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that even though air quality is expected to be unhealthful in 
much of the North County today, the experts see some cause for optimism. The 
summer of 1990, it turns out, is shaping up as one of the least smoggy for the 
county in years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has had fewer smog alerts this summer than any since at least 
1979, South Coast Air Quality Management District statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution experts give some of the credit to the myriad efforts to improve 
air quality in the Los Angeles Basin, among them auto smog controls, car-pool 
lanes and new controls on industrial emissions -- with producing visible 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a fluke," said Bob Phalen, director of the air pollution health 
effects laboratory at the UC Irvine's California College of Medicine. Favorable 
weather alone does not explain away the improvement, he said. "California is 
making progress on air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
But that was not apparent Monday as most of the county sweltered through 
temperatures in the 90s and choked through smog that, although it did not merit 
a smog alert, was nonetheless bad enough to bother plenty of people. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature hit 99 degrees in Anaheim, just one degree shy of the all-time 
high for the date, set in 1948, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. Other parts of Orange 
County weren't far behind: Highs were 95 in Santa Ana, 94 in El Toro and 91 in 
San Juan Capistrano. Forecasters expect today to bring more of the same, with 
highs of 98 in Anaheim and Irvine and highs in the mid- or low 90s in El Toro, 
San Juan Capistrano and Santa Ana. The heat wave is not expected to break until 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified School District officials said they plan to send children 
home early today to protect them from the stifling heat.

"The main point is to get them out early enough in the day, before the heat 
starts to build up," said district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. "It's just too 
oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
A memo was sent home to parents advising them that pupils at some schools will 
be sent home at 1:05 p.m. and that bus drivers have been told of the schedule 
change, Thomas said. The district is focusing on schools with limited air 
conditioning. Children in 16 of the district's 41 schools -- 11 of them 
elementary schools -- will be sent home early, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Monday, only beach-goers were spared. Steady breezes kept air 
temperatures in the mid-70s on Orange County beaches. Water temperature was 70 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful, but windy," said Duncan McCulloch, 26, a lifeguard at 
Huntington Beach State Park. "If there was no wind, it would be baking out here 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards did, however, report a yellowish foam on the water. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get a handful of it, it would be slick," said Sean Steimle, 26, a 
lifeguard at Bolsa Chica State Beach. "I think it's dirty and disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the mousse that washed up when we had the oil spill in February, 
but it's not as dark," said Adrianne Morrison, executive director of Amigos de 
Bolsa Chica, a conservation group. "It's certainly not natural foam or 
plankton." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials could not identify the substance Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokeswoman Carolyn Green said: "Historically, the last week of August and 
the first week of September are the dirtiest two weeks of the year . . . even 
though this is a clean year. When the water and land are really warm, you have 
the same temperatures, which creates worse inversions and the worst smog 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, there have been just three first-stage smog alerts for Orange 
County, contrasted with the seven reported by the same date last year, the AQMD 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The windy weather for most of the summer is responsible for some of the 
improvement, Burback said, as smog-laden air would be blown away from populated 
areas and be replaced by clean, dry, desert air. 
</P>
<P>
"That's also the reason for the warmer temperatures you've experienced all 
summer," Burback said of the winds. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to distinguish the roles that emissions reduction and 
weather conditions played, air quality has improved perhaps 20% to 30% beyond 
what weather patterns alone would explain, said John Holmes, director of 
research for the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"The smog season, of course, isn't over yet, but at this point, based on what 
the actual air quality has been and what the actual meteorology has been, it 
looks like there has been a fairly big decrease" in smog, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not conclusive, the data offers encouragement that the campaign 
for cleaner air is working, Holmes and Phalen said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes also noted that higher oil prices and plentiful natural gas supplies 
this summer have prompted many electric generating plants to switch from 
burning oil to burning relatively cleaner natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the natural gas supplies hold up and the price structure holds up, 
the benefits should continue," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY FIRST-STAGE SMOG ALERTS 
</P>
<P>
Air quality is rated on a Pollutant Standards Index that measures the carbon 
monoxide, ozone and nitrogen dioxide in the air. Conditions which number below 
100 are good, and those from 101 to 199 are considered unhealthy for those who 
are sensitive such as the sick and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions which number between 200 and 275 rate a first-stage alert, and 
children and the elderly are advised to stay indoors. A second-stage alert 
rates from 275 to 399, and everyone is advised to avoid strenuous, outdoor 
activities. A third-stage alert rates above 400, but one hasn't been recorded 
in the county in the last two decades.

SERVICES FRIDAY FOR TEEN SHOT AT BEACH 
</P>

CAPISTRANO BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services for a Capistrano Beach teen-ager who was fatally shot at a 
Dana Point beach during the weekend will be held Friday, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper said officials may decide today whether murder 
charges should be filed against a 16-year-old Laguna Niguel boy arrested in 
connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The family of the victim, Robert James Elliott, described him Monday as a 
regular churchgoer who spent his leisure time trying "to convert people to the 
Lord." 
</P>
<P>
"He took his Bible everywhere and was forever trying to bring people to Jesus,' 
Katherine Boucher said of her slain son. "He would bring all these people, 
including some who were hooked on drugs, into my house. I would have to tell 
him this is not a flophouse." 
</P>
<P>
As surfers and other beach-goers looked on, Elliott was shot in the chest in 
the 1 p.m. incident Saturday at Dana Strand beach. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies arrested the 16-year-old, a student at Dana 
Hills High School, on suspicion of murder. His name was being withheld because 
of his age. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Elliott and the suspect had a running feud over a broken window 
in Elliott's truck. The younger boy had reportedly smashed the window with a 
baseball bat about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Elliott walked up to the 16-year-old on the beach and the two 
argued. The younger boy then walked away, and Elliott pursued him, demanding 
money for the broken window, according to the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The younger boy turned and pulled the trigger, witnesses said. At first the gun 
didn't fire, but the 16-year-old dropped to one knee and squeezed the trigger a 
second time, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies later recovered a handgun, and the 16-year-old was being 
held at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
More than a score of Elliott's friends gathered at his Via Canon house Monday 
to offer their condolences to the family. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't deserve to die this way," said Elliott's sister, 19-year-old Lori 
Elliott. "Everyone should know that you should never resort to guns to solve 
your problems." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said her son was a member of the Calvary Chapel near his house. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said her son, who had learning disabilities, dropped out of San 
Clemente High School but returned to complete his education. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's father, Stephen Elliott, said his son had told him that someone had 
smashed a window in his 1990 Mitsubishi pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliott said he had advanced his son $250 to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad now because I told him that he should be responsible and pay me 
back," said Stephen Elliott, who said he is the president of an Orange County 
company with assets valued at $15 million. "With 20/20 hindsight, I would have 
told him to forget about the money, but Rob was idealistic and he wanted 
everything to be fair. He thought the guy should pay for breaking his window." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the shooting suspect said Monday that he told them he had bought a 
handgun in San Diego. The junior began carrying the weapon to school last week 
because he was fearful of Elliott, they said. Efforts to reach his family were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The service for Elliott will be held at 10 a.m. at Calvary Chapel. 
</P>

3 CLOTHING STORE THEFT SUSPECTS HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people were arrested Monday on suspicion of burglary after police found 
$10,000 worth of stolen clothing in their car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise was stolen from at least 10 retail clothing stores in Irvine 
and Tustin, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were stopped about 4:30 p.m. by Irvine Police Officer Clint McCall 
because they matched a broadcast description of suspects who had just 
burglarized the Public Image Clothing store at 3850 Barranca Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects admitted to the thefts and said they were stealing clothes 
for "personal use" for their back-to-school wardrobes, McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on 10 counts of burglary were Sharla Thomas, 33, of Oceanside; Alfred 
Childress, 22, of Escondido, and Sunday Bishop, 32, of Orange. They were taken 
to Orange County Jail where they were being held in lieu of $10,000 bail each.

NORTH TUSTIN GROUP SEEKS INCORPORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group calling itself Citizens for More Local Control will announce plans 
today to promote the incorporation of North Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, a former Orange County supervisor and state assemblyman, and a 
six-year resident of North Tustin, will act as chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Rawitch, the group's initial organizer, said the plan is to put 
incorporation on the ballot by June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We are divided into two spheres of influence and are being nibbled away by 
piecemeal annexations," Rawitch said. "And staying as a county island no longer 
seems to be a viable option. As a county island, the kind of local control that 
we would like to have is very limited." 
</P>
<P>
Rawitch said the group is in the process of selecting officers and directors 
and will be seeking grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
A study funded by Foothill Communities Assn. and unveiled in June at a town 
hall meeting indicated that a utility-users tax would be needed for the 
28,000-resident community to succeed as a city.

EXTENSION OF FREEZE ON BUILDING SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
A one-year building freeze on development around the Disneyland and Anaheim 
Convention Center area will go into effect immediately if the City Council 
accepts city planners' recommendations tonight. 
</P>
<P>
This is the last time the temporary ordinance can be renewed, and planners are 
seeking the maximum extension of one year. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,040-acre area has been under a temporary freeze since the 30-day 
emergency ordinance was first enacted May 1. It was extended for 90 days in 
June, and will expire this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Development Co., on behalf of the Walt Disney Co., sent the City 
Council a letter supporting the one-year extension, calling it a "necessary and 
customary planning tool." 
</P>
<P>
The company has supported the moratorium from the outset and is working with 
city planners, who are evaluating the possibility of a "second gate," an 
expansion of Disneyland in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The city originally initiated the building freeze because a $300,000 study of 
the area was near completion, and planners said they needed to study the area 
under unchanging conditions. The study outlines ways to revitalize the tourist 
area.LISA MASCARO

TRI-CITY RECYCLING PROGRAM PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
Eager to ease the flow of trash into overflowing landfills and meet a looming 
state limit on waste disposal, three South County cities are gearing up to 
begin curbside recycling programs in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by brand-new recycling trucks, the mayors of San Juan Capistrano, San 
Clemente and Dana Point will unfurl plans for the recycling effort during a 
ceremony at San Juan Capistrano City Hall today at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The three cities are launching the recycling programs in an effort to meet a 
new state law that requires all municipalities to reduce solid waste levels by 
1995. Cities that do not comply with the state mandate could be hit with 
substantial fines. FRANK MESSINA

Leaders of South Coast Community Church have announced the resignation of

Church officials on Monday said Timmons, who had recently taken a sabbatical, 
gave up the $100,000-a-year pastorate to pursue speaking engagements, writing 
and a full-time leadership role in his nonprofit corporation, Game Plan for 
Living. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that 45-year-old Timmons, who is married, had become involved with 
another woman began circulating after he announced to a tearful congregation in 
July that he was taking an eight-week sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth was that he had met a gal that he knew from the area, that he had 
helped," executive pastor Ed Neteland said. "They began to visit more, and he 
felt that that was going to go in the wrong direction and he broke it off." 
</P>
<P>
The resignation was sparked not by the reports but by Timmons' desire to take a 
different direction in his work, Neteland said. Timmons was out of town and 
could not be reached Monday. Timmons' wife, Carol, will continue as a family, 
child and marriage counselor in the church's counseling center, and the family 
will continue to attend the church, Neteland said. In addition, Timmons is 
expected to return for guest speaking engagements, including a three-week 
series in December. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ohio, Timmons attended Dallas Seminary in Texas, worked with Campus 
Crusade for Christ and spent four years giving motivational speeches to 
business and corporate leaders before setting up a counseling practice in 
Newport Beach, Neteland said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, after spending a year as pastor at Mariners Church in Newport 
Beach, where he lives, Timmons started South Coast Community Church as a Bible 
study with about 400 people at Lincoln Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just exploded from there," Neteland said. Today the church is one of the 
biggest in Orange County, with a congregation that officials say numbers more 
than 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
While minister of South Coast Community Church, Timmons has continued speaking 
engagements and writing and has published several books, most recently "Anyone 
Anonymous," which is based on the 12-step program made popular by Alcoholics 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he also started a nonprofit corporation, Game Plan for Living, a 
ministry that offers political leaders, educators and others speeches on how to 
improve in three areas -- becoming a strong, healthy individual, relating to 
people and succeeding professionally. Timmons' book, "Game Plan for Living -- 
One Day at a Time," is scheduled to be released next year, and another book, 
"The Culting of Christianity," is expected before then. 
</P>
<P>
"What he found was that to do all this writing and speaking was too much. He 
was being pulled in too many different directions," Neteland said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Timmons has left the pulpit, once-scarce parking spots on Sunday mornings 
have become plentiful. Neteland acknowledged that attendance has dropped but 
said that that is usual in August, when Timmons traditionally takes his 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The true test, Neteland said, will be what happens this fall as assistant 
pastors continue to fill in at the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons proved a strong drawing card with his dynamic style at the pulpit and 
sermons laced with humor, but Neteland said people were also lured to the 
church by its activities and groups. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast offers groups for singles, couples, college students and children 
in addition to drama classes, retreats, seminars and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Neteland said the board will create a task force to review candidates for 
senior pastor.

COUNCIL OPPOSES EXPANSION OF BASE; 
</P>
<P>
PROJECT: MEMBERS VOTE AGAINST THE NAVY'S PROPOSAL TO ADD TO PORT FACILITIES AT 
THE SEAL BEACH NAVAL WEAPONS STATION.

<P>
The City Council Monday added its voice to the growing opposition to a Navy 
proposal to build a $200-million expansion of its port facilities at the Seal 
Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 4 to 0, with Mayor Edna Wilson abstaining, to formally 
oppose the expansion project that would change the configuration of Anaheim 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision came despite a plea by Capt. Stephen T. Holl, commanding 
officer of the weapons station, that they delay any vote until an environmental 
study is completed in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the council member who represents the coastal area near the weapons station 
urged them to avoid any delays. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want your facility to be expanded in a residential neighborhood," 
Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings said. "We feel it poses a lot of hazards 
and potential danger to the environment." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's proposal has already come under fire from nearly every quarter in 
the local community. 
</P>
<P>
Last week an unlikely coalition of environmentalists, peace activists, wealthy 
homeowners, surfers, local merchants, and realtors formed a new group, Stop the 
Breakwater, to coordinate their opposition. They plan to begin collecting 
signatures door-to-door for a petition they will send to the secretary of the 
Navy, urging him not to seek funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
A local congressman predicted that unless the Navy substantially alters the 
project, it will never receive any funding. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long 
Beach), who represents the area, said he would vote against the project in its 
current form. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's opponent in November's elections, Democrat Guy Kimbrough, said he 
has "serious reservations" about the proposal but would like to see the results 
of environmental studies from both the Navy and independent environmental 
groups before he makes a final judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said "the chances are virtually nil that a military construction 
can go through over the objections of the local congressman." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher echoed the concerns of local residents over the proposal, which 
includes a 4,000-foot extension of the east jetty of Anaheim Bay, the waterway 
between Seal Beach and Huntington Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Large warships, which now must anchor three miles away and be serviced by small 
barges, could by 1997 tie up to the new jetty and load or unload ammunition 
directly onto a new wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents worry that the huge L-shaped structure would all but eliminate 
the surf on Surfside and Sunset beaches, worsen beach erosion by shifting the 
sand into new patterns and drive down property values by turning the scenic 
oceanfront into something resembling a naval shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Some also worry that since the project would enable the weapons station to 
service three times as many ships as is currently possible, increased ship 
traffic could add to pollution offshore and increased handling of weapons could 
add to the danger of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Holl said increased ship-handling capacity would not necessarily mean more 
ships would use the base. Nor would abandoning the project prevent more ships 
from using the base if demand for its services increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't expand the port, we might have to do other things to get people 
through here faster," he said. "We might have to work weekends or during the 
night."

PEOPLE: CAN HE PEDAL HIS OWN CANOE TO $25,000 PRIZE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sidney G. Shutt is ready to gobble up the $25,000 that E.I. du Pont de Nemours 
&amp; Co. is offering to anyone who can travel 100 meters at 20 knots in a 
pedal boat. 
</P>
<P>
It just so happens that pedal boating is Shutt's expertise, a hobby that dates 
back to the 63-year-old, retired Rockwell International engineer's youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, I see that it is possible," Shutt said. "What is really 
exciting is the technical challenge. I'd say I'm a serious contender." 
</P>
<P>
But he notes that others are in the running, including a team at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Shutt set a world record in 1988 in Visalia by traveling 200 meters in his 
43-pound pedal boat at the rate of 15.91 m.p.h. This took place at a speed 
competition sponsored by the International Human Powered Vehicle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he took overall second in the group's competition in Adrian, Mich., 
which included a 100-meter sprint, a 120-meter slalom and a 50-meter lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Besides boats, competitions sponsored by the group include bicycles, airplanes, 
helicopters or anything else that is human-powered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 6 when I built my first boat with wood slats I took from our back-yard 
fence in Long Beach," recollects Shutt, who now lives in Brea. "I didn't even 
get in trouble for taking the slats. My parents were very encouraging to me." 
</P>
<P>
Shutt said his parents later moved to Whittier where they frequented a grocery 
store owned by President Nixon's parents. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents liked to tell me that the store had a delivery service and Richard 
Nixon used to deliver groceries to them." 
</P>
<P>
His boats today are much more sophisticated, most of them built in the form of 
hydrofoils. The kayak-like boats are on struts which raise them a foot above 
the water to better skim the surface. 
</P>
<P>
They are steered by hand controls on each side and are powered by pedaling 
bicycle mechanisms that turn a propeller. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier College and USC graduate said he also likes sailboats but finds 
more fun in his pedal boats, which he tests in the waters off the 15th Street 
dock in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The boats are just a lot of fun and it's nice doing something that is a little 
different," Shutt said. "I'm even getting to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
It's exciting to make the boat go faster, said Shutt, who takes his boat for 
weekly runs with his son, Dave Shutt of Dana Point, in the waters off Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Shutt purposely tips the boat over to make sure he can right it. 
"We've found out you can't tip it over unless you want to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His expertise in boats comes from building an assortment of sailboats and 
trimarans. Although he hasn't built boats to sell, he doesn't discount that for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Shutt builds and gives away boats to friends. The boats are a 
nice gift since the combination Fiberglas, resin, foam and aluminum craft cost 
from $2,000 to $3,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning I'd take old bicycle skeletons to power the boats and they 
would do 6 or 7 knots," he said. "My, how times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
Although retired, Shutt operates a small engineering business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a regular retired guy who mows his lawn, reads and takes care of the 
house," he said, "but I like to have an active day." 
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary party for Dottie, 68, and Ken Sime, 71, turned into a 
bonanza for needy people. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of gifts for the La Habra couple, guests were asked to bring 
non-perishable goods, which were later donated to the La Habra Resources Care 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The 220 who attended brought 700 items. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were married Oct. 9, 1940, but decided to hold the party early to 
accommodate their two daughters and seven grandchildren who live out of state 
and might not be able to attend because of school. 
</P>
<P>
"People participated more than we thought they might," Ken Sime said. "It also 
solved the problem of what to buy for a 50th anniversary. This way they were 
able to give something that could be used in a very positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
"The gift-giving idea wasn't an original idea, but it was a good one," he said.

<P>
In a single game, Bohuslavizki, a senior, surpassed his reception total of last 
season and tied the Estancia single-game reception record. A non-starter last 
year -- he had only eight receptions -- Bohuslavizki moved into Estancia's 
starting lineup Thursday and caught 11 of Matt Johner's passes for 269 yards 
and three touchdowns to help the Eagles rally to defeat Los Amigos, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
Bohuslavizki had five receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns -- one of 50 
yards, the other of 14 with 34 seconds remaining -- in the final three minutes 
of the game. "We kept throwing it," Estancia Coach John Liebengood said. "And 
they didn't make any adjustments. They didn't do anything different. 
Consequently, he kept catching the ball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Brent Austin, an El Modena cross-country runner who ran 16 minutes 17.6 
seconds for three miles to finish second in the Bronco Classic Saturday and 
lead El Modena to the team title. 
</P>
<P>
* Kennedy's Vince Church, who rushed 25 times for 255 yards, ran for three

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kristina Dahlberg 
</P>
<P>
School: El Modena High School 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Cross-Country 
</P>
<P>
Height: 5-8 
</P>
<P>
Weight: 125 
</P>
<P>
Barely into her second year of serious running, Dahlberg is continuing her 
rapid development. In her first cross-country race of her sophomore year, she 
finished second at the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Classic, helping El Modena to the 
team championship. 
</P>
<P>
Her time -- 19 minutes 29.9 seconds for three miles -- eclipsed the course 
record, but another sophomore, Erica Sumi of Long Beach Wilson, set the new 
course record, finishing the race in 18:56.8. 
</P>
<P>
Before Dahlberg started running with the El Modena team last summer, her 
athletic experiences basically were limited to playing for youth soccer teams. 
But she caught on quickly and soon was the top runner on El Modena's girls' 
team. She finished fourth in the Century League finals and ninth in the 
Southern Section 4-A cross-country championships last fall and third in the 
1,600 at the Southern Section 3-A championships last spring. By the end of the 
school year, she had broken all but one El Modena varsity distance record. 
"It's just sort of surprising because there was no indication that she would be 
as good as she turned out to be," El Modena Coach Tom Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Natalie Austin, an El Modena cross-country runner whose third-place time of 
19:42.7 at the Bronco Classic invitational beat the course record. 
</P>
<P>
* Laura Amrofell, a Foothill cross-country runner whose seventh-place finish 
(17:56) in the Kiwanis Seaside Invitational in Ventura Saturday helped the 
Knights finish third in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
* Wendy Herb and Julie Lugaro, who led Rosary to a 15-11, 12-15, 15-13 victory 
over Valencia in the championship match of the Valencia girls' volleyball 
tournament Saturday. Herb and Lugaro each made the all-tournament team.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE FOUNDER OF THE SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL MICROCOMP COMPUTER 
SERVICES FIRM IS NAMED A SMALL-BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR.

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1984, and Luciano (Lucky) Capote had recently retired, with some 
reluctance, from his job as regional manager of Texas Instruments' computer 
services division in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At 58, the Cuban-born businessman felt that he was too young to spend the rest 
of his life just watching the waves break near his oceanfront home in San 
Clemente, so he decided to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
He withdrew $50,000 from his family's savings and founded National Microcomp 
Inc. in a Mission Viejo garage to pursue the business he knew best -- fixing 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The business, he says, has brought him more financial rewards than he had ever 
dreamed of. And now it has brought him something more. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department named Capote the small-business person 
of the year for Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this silly notion that I can do whatever I want to do so long as the 
opportunities are there for my taking. It's all up to me," said Capote. The 
nickname Lucky, he added, originated years ago when friends at Texas A&amp;M 
University "couldn't pronounce my name right." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, National Microcomp, now based in Tustin, rang up sales of $1.1 
million servicing the computers of aerospace and distribution companies, 
hospitals and banks and distribution companies in California, Hawaii and 
Arizona. His company, which now has 17 employees, recently added a division 
that sells computer hardware. Its customers include aerospace heavyweights such 
as Ford Aerospace, Hughes Aircraft and General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
But Capote credits his 25-year career with Texas Instruments, the Dallas-based 
computer and defense firm, with laying the foundation for his current success. 
</P>
<P>
"When I created the service division at Texas Instruments, it was like creating 
a new business," he said. "I learned how to make the business grow and how to 
keep it profitable yet lean and efficient enough to be responsible to the 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
He also learned not to put all of his eggs in one basket. Capote's business is 
equally divided among aerospace firms, private companies and government 
customers, the U.S. Navy and Air Force among them. 
</P>
<P>
Capote, like the owners of many other growing small businesses, would like to 
expand his company into other areas. He would like, for example, to get into 
reselling computers made by various manufacturers, he said. But he does not 
have the money or the staff to do that just now. 
</P>
<P>
Capote also says he has learned some hard lessons along the way. He conceded 
that when he started his company six years ago, his biggest problem was 
attitude. Used to arranging million-dollar deals during his days with Texas 
Instruments, he figured that it would be no time at all before he was making 
megabuck deals, despite having "only a little garage to show as my office." 
</P>
<P>
It took what Capote describes as relentless prodding to persuade Wells Fargo 
Bank to give him his first big order: a service contract for 900 computer 
terminals in the bank's California branches. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wadell, district director of the Small Business Administration regional 
office that oversees Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said Capote 
stands out because of his dedication to provide good-quality services at 
affordable rates. "Lucky has been successful in great part because of his 
excellent marketing skills and close attention to the needs of his customers," 
Wadell said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rick, who was Capote's boss at Texas Instruments in Houston, said: "I've 
known Lucky for about 30 years, and he has always been hard-working and a 
people-oriented person. He understood what customers expected of him, and he 
delivered it." 
</P>
<P>
Capote, however, says that starting a business was easy compared to the 
situation he faced when he stepped off a dusty Greyhound bus at College 
Station, Tex., at age 26. It was 1954, and he had come to the United States for 
the first time to study electrical engineering at Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
He was the son of a poor grocery bookkeeper and a seamstress, and he knew no 
English. Still, he was determined to break the chain of poverty his family had 
known in Havana and to get the college degree that would help him do that. 
</P>
<P>
Capote never got his college degree, but he did earn the financial security he 
had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at Texas Instruments," he said, "I dreamed of bringing my family 
out of Cuba one day -- and I did."

COMPUTER COMPANIES FIGHTING A LEGAL BATTLE OVER MICROPROCESSOR PATENTS 
</P>

Gilbert Hyatt, the La Palma researcher who shook the computer industry two 
weeks ago when he announced that he had received a patent for inventing the 
microprocessor after a 20-year legal fight, isn't the only one seeking 
royalties on microchip technology. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Victor, spokesman for Texas Instruments Inc., said the company is seeking 
to enforce nine microprocessor-related patents that cover basic functions such 
as how a computer's overall system interacts with a microprocessor -- the 
"brains" of a computer and many other electronic devices. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hyatt, TI is seeking to enforce patents covering specific microprocessor 
functions rather than a patent on the basic device itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think the Hyatt patent will have any effect on our litigation with 
Zenith Data Systems Corp.," Victor said. TI sued Zenith Data in December for 
patent infringement. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, Tandy Corp. filed suit against TI, alleging that the 
Dallas-based firm has violated antitrust laws and has charged excessive fees to 
companies that want to license TI's patented microprocessor technology. Victor 
said the suit is a "typical counterclaim" without merit. 
</P>
<P>
Victor added, however, that TI claims to hold the basic patent on the invention 
of the microprocessor through a patent granted to TI engineer Gary W. Boone on 
Sept. 4, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is not yet challenging Hyatt's patent claim in court. But 
with TI unwilling to accept the ruling by the patent office, the two sides 
could be headed for a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy contends TI's patent is invalid because TI's version of the 
microprocessor was invented after other parties had already invented it.

NEWPORT BEACH'S TINY HARBOR ISLAND MAY BE THE COUNTY'S PRICIEST ENCLAVE

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture the island: a part of Newport Beach that can be walked end to end in 15 
minutes -- less if you don't stop to gawk -- but oh so private and hard to 
reach. Signs on Bayside Drive direct motorists away from this little jewel, and 
access is via a bridge wide enough for only one car at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the houses have private docks. While there technically is public 
access from the water, once someone gets from the water onto the island, he's 
on private property. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the houses feature swimming pools or tennis courts. Most are built on 
lots in the 5,000- to 9,000-square-foot range. 
</P>
<P>
This is tiny Harbor Island, where decades ago the lots went for $5,000 -- or 
$2,500 if you built a house on the property within a year of purchase. Now it's 
the home of the $9-million tear-down, and, foot-for-foot, may be the priciest 
enclave in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
One family owned two lots from 1928 through 1989. Title to the property then 
changed hands four times in 18 months; two men who paid $6.6 million in May, 
1989, sold it eight months later for around $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those two lots used to be home to Gladys Gardiner, who was known by one friend 
as "the island newspaper" because of her interest in the latest goings-on. She 
was a gregarious woman, friendly and outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
The latest owner of her property is just about the opposite, a man with such a 
penchant for secrecy that he bought the property through an agent in January, 
keeping his name off public records until July. 
</P>
<P>
The new buyer? Donald Bren, president and owner of the Irvine Co. and the 
county's only billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, who also has homes in Holmby Hills and Linda Isle and an apartment at New 
York's tony Pierre Hotel, joins Harbor Island residents like George Argyros, 
developer and former owner of the Seattle Mariners baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
His purchase of the Gardiner property comes amid a spate of building and 
remodeling in this small enclave of wealth, where homes routinely sell for $5 
million and up and which has only 25 or so homes, some of them on double lots, 
like Bren's. For some, the recent land boom signals an end to an era on the 
island, a time when owners may have been nearly as rich as oil sheiks but 
weren't quite as flashy about it. 
</P>
<P>
For a spot that once was the summer home of violinist Jascha Heifetz and held 
an estate of H.F. Ahmanson, the banker whose name lives on at the Ahmanson 
theater in downtown Los Angeles, Harbor Island started modestly enough. 
</P>
<P>
The property was dredged and filled in the 1920s, after Balboa Island and Lido 
Isle, and developed by Joseph Beek and Louis Briggs. Beek's son, Allan, said 
three or four people lived on the island in the early days, including Gladys 
Gardiner and her husband, Everett, whom everyone called Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Gardiner "was a college chum of my father" at what is now Caltech, Beek 
said. "It was a typical rich-boy, poor-boy relationship. My dad was poor, 
working his way through school. Everett had inherited wealth, but they became 
strong friends." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner, whose parents lived on Balboa Island on the property that Beek said 
was later bought by movie actor Buddy Ebsen, had degrees in law and engineering 
but never worked at either. He was, however, a tinkerer. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Gardiner built himself a car, "a little, open, four-sided 
wooden thing with wheels on it and an electric motor," remembered Jean Watt, 
who grew up on Harbor Island and still lives there. With gasoline tightly 
rationed during the war years, Gardiner used the electric car "to go over to 
Balboa Island and around town," Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Isle, then called Shark Island and not yet developed, was known as a 
fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes, Watt said. So Gardiner made a point of 
pouring oil on the ponds where the mosquitoes would otherwise flourish. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids liked to go down and chat with Gladys," Watt said. "We called her 'the 
island newspaper.' She was the one who knew what was going on. She was the one 
you could count on to know why the ambulance came on the island. And Duke was 
the one you could count on to fix something if it was broken. They were really 
the guts of the island." 
</P>
<P>
Everett "Duke" Gardiner died in 1960. Gladys continued her volunteer work with 
the Assistance League of Newport Beach well into her 90s. As the years went on, 
she grew concerned about rising property taxes on her lot and about inflation, 
according to those who knew her. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, she deeded her house to Hoag Hospital, which let her live in it for 
the rest of her life and paid her $10,000 a month in return for inheriting the 
property when she died. In January of 1989, she died of heart problems, leaving 
an estate of $800,000 -- half of it going to Caltech, the rest to charities and 
friends -- and the house. 
</P>
<P>
By then, property values in Orange County were going wild. 
</P>
<P>
One parcel that Beek remembers his mother selling for $300,000 or so in 1972 or 
thereabouts -- a good chunk of change for that time -- now is valued at $6.9 
million by the county assessor. Another home on the island is now up for sale 
at about $15 million (reduced from the original asking price of more than $17 
million, according to real estate agents). Properties bought in the last few 
years routinely show assessed values of $3 million, $5 million, $9.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
One 15,000-square-foot house boasts two elevators, one at each end, to make it 
easier to get from the basement to the first and second floors. The owner said 
workmen pumped 15,000 gallons of water a minute for eight months to lower the 
water level on the property enough to pour the slab for the basement. 
</P>
<P>
But as prices have increased, the sense of community has decreased, some 
old-time residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a great place," said Larry Porter, 44, who grew up on the island 
but, with his siblings, sold the family property three years ago after his 
parents died. "But now it's, well, like everything in general has changed. The 
flavor of living in Southern California now (has changed). The island is kind 
of a fortress for, in my opinion, people who are somewhat insensitive of the 
way they've been economically blessed." 
</P>
<P>
In bygone days, "there was an island Christmas party," said Porter, who now 
lives elsewhere in Newport Beach but is thinking of moving out of the area 
altogether. The atmosphere year-round, he said, was one "where you waved to 
your neighbor, you liked your neighbor. You wouldn't hesitate to borrow 
something from someone. Nowadays, they don't even talk to each other over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Watt is less harsh but does say that in the old days "we had more 
neighborhood kinds of things going on. Now it's kind of everyone does their own 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
"My father would have described it as 'Everyone has too much money,' " said 
Watt, a longtime community activist and co-founder of the environmental group 
Stop Polluting Our Newport, which had notable success in putting limits on the 
noise from planes at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Today's islanders seem to be "interested in getting more money, building bigger 
houses and getting more cars," said Watt. "It's just gotten to be one of those 
places where, like a lot of others in Newport, they feel that every square foot 
has to have something built on it because it's worth more money that way." 
</P>
<P>
Winifred Voegelin said that with all the changes on the island lately, "you 
kind of hunker down." She's lived in her house for 40 years; with her late 
husband, an attorney who for years was an officer in the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce, she hosted an annual lawn party for the consular corps in 
Los Angeles, followed by a Newport Bay cruise that started and ended at the 
dock on their property. 
</P>
<P>
Though the recent spate of building and remodeling does bother Hansel 
Benvenuti, a retired doctor, he finds things in general pretty fine. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors are "friendly, but keep to themselves," he said. And the property 
has appreciated quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years ago, Benvenuti paid $275,000 for the lot; he figures it cost 
about $600,000 to build the house. Now he estimates that it's worth about $5 
million. "I couldn't afford to buy it today," he said. On the other hand, he 
figures he can't really afford to sell it either, because of the taxes on those 
capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Benvenuti's wife, Martha, a retired lawyer, said many people can look at Harbor 
Island without knowing just what it is they're seeing. "They see the homes from 
the water, and they don't know where they are," she said. She especially 
treasures her garden and "my view of the bay every morning when I wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Though parking is a problem, requiring the Benvenutis to hire a valet parker 
when they have a party, she said Harbor Island remains "a private place for 
people who want privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hamilton, head of the island's community association, moved there from 
Corona del Mar four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be on the water with a big yard, relatively speaking," said 
Hamilton. "There are not many places on the water with yards. It's one of the 
beauties of Harbor Island that everybody is restricted; they cannot build out 
close to the sea walls, so they have large yards, big setbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton was a co-owner of what is now the Bren property for a while, buying it 
from Hoag Hospital for $6.6 million with Jim Peters, another home builder. 
</P>
<P>
In January of this year, Lowell C. Martindale Jr., a lawyer with the firm of 
O'Melveny &amp; Myers, bought the property on behalf of Bren. Neither he nor 
Hamilton nor Peters will say what the price was, but county records show the 
property now valued at $9.25 million, so that's the assumed selling price. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton will say that the purchase offers made to him and Peters were "so 
attractive" that the men scrapped their original plans to raze the Gardiner 
residence and build two homes for themselves on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Martindale agreed that it's "a possibility" that Bren wouldn't buy property in 
his own name lest a seller see the billionaire coming and jack up the asking 
price. Also, he said, "Mr. Bren, for such a prominent figure, is a private 
person and would probably prefer to keep his personal affairs private to the 
extent he can." 
</P>
<P>
Martindale said Bren plans to tear down the old Gardiner residence and build a 
new one. That means he could eventually wind up with the highest-priced 
property among those on Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, one home -- a part of the old Ahmanson estate -- sold at around $14 
million, and it's still under construction. And the other home on the Ahmanson 
property, which was divided after his death, is up for grabs at somewhere 
around $15 million.

JOSEPH N. BELL: A LIST OF INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE FROM THE PAGES OF 1 LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life Magazine has just released the results of a study in which a passel of 
historians were asked to name the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th 
Century. Not, as the editor noted, "the most famous but the most influential." 
</P>
<P>
I always read essentially meaningless lists like this, just as I frequently 
take those idiotic quizes in magazines to find out how I shape up as a father, 
lover, intellect or whether or not I'm happy, underachieving or generally 
screwing up my life. If I make a good score, I know the quiz was thoughtful and 
scientifically conceived; a bad score tells me it was a sham, drawn up to fill 
a last-minute hole in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
So I studied the Life list critically and decided -- as I'm sure most of you 
who read it did -- that I would have made quite different choices. Then I 
realized the names that popped in my head were the Americans who were most 
influential in my life. Only in a few instances did those names parallel the 
list compiled by Life. And few of them ever came into the view of historians. 
</P>
<P>
But once I began brooding about the people most influential in my life, I was 
compelled to make my own list. Here, without in any way assessing an order of 
importance, are some of the names that come quickly to mind: 
</P>
<P>
* A young advertising man named Arthur Madsen, who befriended a lonely 
12-year-old neighbor boy in Spokane, Wash., and spent many hours with me going 
carefully and quite seriously over my efforts to rewrite the Tarzan and Oz 
books. 
</P>
<P>
* A brilliant, troubled writing professor at the University of Missouri named 
Winston Allard who apparently saw the same spark in my writing when I was a 
25-year-old war veteran and made work demands that turned me into a 
professional in one intense year. 
</P>
<P>
* A former editor of Esquire Magazine named Frederic Birmingham whom I first 
met when he spoke at Missouri Journalism Week and who encouraged me to write 
for a living. Because I already had a family at the end of World War II, I 
chose to take the safe route into public relations instead. Every time 
Birmingham came to Chicago, he would call me and we would have lunch and he 
would ask, "What are you writing?" And I would tell him that although I wanted 
to desperately, I didn't have time to write. For five years he accepted that 
answer, but the sixth year, he told me that was baloney, that if I was serious 
about writing I would find time, and that he didn't intend to meet me for lunch 
again until I had something to show him. I started writing that week. And I 
haven't stopped since. 
</P>
<P>
* Former Minnesota football coach Bernie Bierman, who was in charge of 
athletics at the Navy Iowa Pre-Flight School in 1942. Bierman had just put us 
through some debilitating exercises and we were lying, exhausted, on the ground 
when he asked if there was a quarterback in our group. I raised my hand, 
figuring he needed someone to call signals while the rest of these slobs worked 
out. He stood over me, looked down, and said. "We don't need a quarterback for 
this next drill, son, so why don't you take 20 laps around the track." In one 
sentence, Bierman taught me 1) never to volunteer, and 2) never to 
underestimate someone I way trying to con. 
</P>
<P>
* Former Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who almost bankrupted me my first 
year as a free-lance writer because I spent so much time watching the 
Army-McCarthy hearings on television. But it was time well spent because it 
raised my political consciousness about 500%, taught me that there are 
intrinsically amoral people who have to be dealt with at that place, and made 
me realize that there are times we have to take a stand regardless of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
* A real estate broker named Stuart Standish who showed me how to live and may 
have been the single most important influence in my early postwar life. I met 
Standish when I walked into his real estate office in Westchester, Ill., with 
my young family by pure chance. He took us house hunting and very quickly 
became almost an extension of our family. He refused to let us buy a house that 
would have given him a sizable commission and finally put us in one which 
offered him nothing, but was absolutely right for us. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years as we moved about the country, Standish would pop in and out of 
our lives, always wise, always honest and straight-forward -- and tough when he 
needed to be, and always full of an infectious zest for life. The last time I 
saw him was about 15 years ago, shortly after his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
He was about 75, then, and he stopped by our house en route to Mexico on a 
snorkeling expedition. When we didn't hear from him for some months afterward, 
I tried to reach him and found his phone in Chicago had been disconnected and 
my letters were returned. I guess I prefer not knowing what happened to him. 
That makes it easier to think of him as immortal -- and to know that his soul 
is surely projected in my life. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many, many more when I let my head roam over all those years. 
There's a factory worker named Joe Swedie about whom I wrote for the Saturday 
Evening Post. He was an orphan who learned that he could bring joy to orphaned 
French children during World War II by showing them movies, then kept on doing 
it when he got home, using his modest income to rent movies to show to kids who 
were desperately sick in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Just as McCarthy made me accept the existence of amorality, Joe Swedie showed 
me that there are people so inherently good, decent and unselfish that it is 
almost obscene to look for hidden motives. 
</P>
<P>
John Kennedy showed me there can be substance in style and Oscar Hammerstein 
that there is great strength in gentleness and Adlai Stevenson that thinking is 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
And my father -- late in his life, when I was ready to let go of my own 
problems and reach out to him where he was -- taught me the dignity of privacy 
and that humor leavens everything it touches. 
</P>
<P>
I'm suddenly aware that there are no women on this list, and I'm not sure why. 
I think the main reason goes to the nature of men and women. The influence of 
women on my life was lengthy and pervasive and usually (partly because of the 
times) subtle -- and quite possibly more profound than any of the men listed 
above. But the nature of that influence makes it more difficult to identify and 
tabulate in specifics, while the men come easily to mind. 
</P>
<P>
(I showed this to my wife as a matter of self-preservation, and she accused me 
of "kissing off" the importance of women in my life with a soporific at the 
end. She also suggested I include Coco, our female dachshund, who taught me 
patience late in my life, and Mary Todd Lincoln for providing a role model in 
what to avoid in a wife. I think there is some sarcasm here., but I'm not 
sure.) 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, I'm glad Life Magazine didn't consult me in this matter. I not 
only couldn't have been objective but would probably have been distressed to 
see so few of my entries on the final list.

LEISURE SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County View.

<TEXT>
<P>
Do you work just as hard at having fun as you do at your job? 
</P>
<P>
Then you may be going about it all wrong, says Steve Sumpter. And your efforts 
to reduce the level of stress in your life through leisure activities may be 
having the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have a work-oriented approach to their leisure," says Sumpter, who 
is director of rehabilitation services at Capistrano by the Sea Hospital in 
Dana Point and a specialist in leisure counseling. "They think it must be 
productive, competitive, and they want to excel at it rather than just enjoy 
the activity for its own sake." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure is more intense in a place like Orange County, where we have 
virtually limitless leisure options from the beach to the mountains to the 
malls to amusement parks, but only a limited amount of time, energy and money 
to spend on those activities. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, he says, is the old Puritan work ethic, which views 
leisure as an unnecessary and frivolous indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
But even if we are willing to put fun on the priority list, Sumpter says, we 
may not know how to go about it because "none of us was ever taught how to use 
leisure time." 
</P>
<P>
Like anything else, he says, leisure skills must be learned and practiced. 
"It's not automatic. We didn't learn it in school, and for most of us it's kind 
of a trial-and-error thing. Or we pattern ourselves after our parents, which 
may not be good because they didn't learn leisure skills, either." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to teaching leisure skills at the hospital, Sumpter has also put 
together a self-published booklet, "Are You Having Fun Yet? A Guide to 
Developing Leisure Time Skills." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, he identifies 11 common barriers to leisure, attitudes and beliefs 
that keep us from enjoying our leisure time: 
</P>
<P>
1. Lack of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
2. Self-esteem problems. 
</P>
<P>
3. The work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
4. Low leisure priority. 
</P>
<P>
5. Finances. 
</P>
<P>
6. Perfectionist thinking. 
</P>
<P>
7. Inability to substitute one activity for another when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
8. Lack of a partner with similar interests. 
</P>
<P>
9. Transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
10. Time management. 
</P>
<P>
11. Ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
The last item on the list, Sumpter says, is most important. "Sometimes we need 
to learn how to get out of our own way." 
</P>
<P>
Leisure activity, or in some cases inactivity, can be used not only as a 
counterweight against the pressures of work, but a good balance of leisure 
choices can help keep the various aspects of the self in balance as well, 
Sumpter says. 
</P>
<P>
But to meet our needs, he says, we first must become aware of what those needs 
are. To identify specific areas that should be addressed, Sumpter sits down 
with patients and has them take inventory, in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a needs assessment. We put together a list of the roles they play, work 
roles, relationship roles, and try to identify what they need that they don't 
currently have. After they've listed those needs, we prioritize them in rank 
order and come up with a plan of action to address the needs. Maybe, for 
example, they see that they need to devote more time to family activities," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Sumpter works from a list of 305 possible leisure activities to help patients 
get a clearer idea of what sorts of activities they lean toward and what sorts 
they avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure should bring out all aspects of a person, he says. He identifies those 
aspects as physical, passive, adventurous, artistic or creative, unusual or 
different, and intellectual or scientific. 
</P>
<P>
"If I look over the list and find I have no adventurous activity listed, I 
would then go back and try to find one," he says. "If you really don't want to 
be adventurous, you don't have to, but maybe you can find something that would 
allow you to explore that area. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the older we get, the less risk-taking we get. Sometimes 
it helps to challenge ourselves with little challenges that create new energy 
and let us assess life from a different side of the fence." 
</P>
<P>
But success is more likely, he says, if we begin by setting small, realistic 
goals. "If your goal is to be more adventurous, don't start with hang-gliding," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
For family activities, try to find areas of common interest and work from 
there, Sumpter says. 
</P>
<P>
Planning and assessing can be helpful, but Sumpter cautions that too much 
planning is not good. "You want to have some spontaneity," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And don't be afraid to experiment, "even if it's something you're not 
particularly good at." 
</P>
<P>
Some of us tend to prefer work to leisure because the rewards there are more 
concrete, he says. "Work provides us all with a real, tangible outcome. From 
our jobs we can assess one another, compare ourselves to others by the cars we 
drive, the houses we live in, and so forth," he says. "But other values may not 
necessarily be as tangible, but they have tremendous value to the self. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people will choose to stay in the work environment just because they lack 
other ways to gain satisfaction. They think, 'If I'm not finding success in my 
leisure time, then what's the point of making time for it?' " 
</P>
<P>
The worst extreme, Sumpter says, is those who decide to wait until retirement 
to start enjoying themselves. When that long-awaited day comes, they don't know 
where to begin, and retirement becomes stressful instead of relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
People who come to the hospital for specific problems such as eating disorders 
and chemical dependencies often have specific leisure problems, Sumpter says. 
Eating disorder patients tend to want their leisure activities to be organized 
and controlled, as they do other aspects of their lives. And 
chemical-dependency patients have a propensity for adventurous, high-risk 
activities, seeking the "high" of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to help them find activities to help them deal with the fact that 
realistically, life is not a constant high," Sumpter says. He might suggest 
gardening, for example, to help a recovering addict learn to enjoy life in a 
calmer way. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the most effective use of time is to simply waste it, Sumpter says. 
"It's healthy and productive to have some time you don't have to account for."

ANN CONWAY: CHANEL STORE OPENS IN A STYLE EQUAL TO MADEMOISELLE HERSELF

<P>
Even Coco Chanel would have said, "Oui, oui!" 
</P>
<P>
 The gala opening of the Chanel boutique at South Coast Plaza Sunday was as 
classic as Chanel herself. 
</P>
<P>
No garish red carpet greeted these party-goers, 500 supporters of Opera 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not. Instead, a cream-colored carpet the color of fine pearls was 
unrolled for guests visiting the Carrara-marble clad store, one of three in 
California (Chanel cognoscenti know the other two are in San Francisco and 
Beverly Hills). 
</P>
<P>
Forget planter boxes that just showcase greenery during galas held in shopping 
malls. On this night, Chanel accessorized South Coast Plaza's planters with 
white orchids -- hundreds of them -- thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, admitted Chanel President Arie Kopelman, Chanel was hard-put to open 
a boutique in a mall. "We prefer a free-standing store," Kopelman said. But 
Henry Segerstrom, managing partner of C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons with Hal 
Segerstrom, convinced the stylish executive that South Coast Plaza was the 
place to hole up in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Kopelman said, he needed to be assured he would get the locale -- 
the spot right across from Tiffany &amp; Co. He did. 
</P>
<P>
And then, Kopelman said, he needed to be assured that the front of the boutique 
would jut out so that the shop would look as if it was free-standing. It does. 
</P>
<P>
Now then. Chanel taught Orange County a thing or two about dressing up when it 
staged a showing of its fall/winter 1990 collection at the affair. Everybody 
knows some members of Orange County society like to step out in Technicolor, 
show off their aerobicized bodies in rose-pink, apple green, even sunshine 
yellow on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Black alone -- especially the little black suit with the 
elongated jacket -- or black with cream is the appropriate look for night. 
(Unless, of course, you're attending a gorgeous white-tie gala in an equally 
gorgeous ballroom. Then you might want to step into one of Chanel's jewel-tone 
couture creations.) 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Segerstrom -- Hal Segerstrom's wife and honorary chairwoman of the 
gala -- epitomized the classic Chanel evening look in a black-and-cream 
cocktail suit. "I feel wonderful in it," said Jeanette, a member of the Opera 
Pacific board. "I just wish it wasn't so warm tonight!" 
</P>
<P>
No problem. French bubbly helped the guests forget the lack of fresh air, and 
so did a few fancy hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
After all was said and done, the guests seemed happy with the Chanel 
silhouettes created by Karl Lagerfeld, especially the divinely cut black 
cocktail suits and the billowing open-skirted evening gowns. "I'd buy one of 
those gowns in a minute," chirped Barbara Glabman. "If I could sew up the 
front!" 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: gala co-chairwomen Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson; Opera 
Pacific board chairwoman Floss Schumacher; Barbara Cirkva, Chanel senior vice 
president (perfectly chic in short black crepe); and Opera Pacific director 
David DiChiera, with his wife, Karen. And just about everybody else who is 
anybody in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ciao!: While supporters of Opera Pacific were celebrating the fashions of 
France, supporters of the Laguna Art Museum were celebrating the culinary joys 
of Italy at the home of Dorothy and Donald Bendetti Sunday night. Up for 
tasting in the Bendettis' beautiful Emerald Bay home: mouthwatering fare cooked 
up by Ambrosia of Beverly Hills. On the menu: platters of antipasto, grilled 
tuna medallions with Italian olive relish, pork roast with braised fennel, and 
fried eggplant with buffalo mozzarella. Dessert? Torte a la Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
And this supper was served on plates the Bendettis bought on the romantic 
Amalfi coast. Eat your heart out, Wolfgang Puck. The supper was part of the 
museum's "Perspectives" fund-raising party series. 
</P>
<P>
Social Scoop: Renee and Henry Segerstrom will stage a cocktail party for museum 
directors and curators from around the world on Wednesday night in their 
Newport Bay home. The party -- sure to be special (and impossible to get into 
unless you're a very, very arty type) -- precedes a dinner for members of the 
Comite International Pour les Musees that will be held in the Isamu Noguchi 
California Scenario Garden in Costa Mesa. Also attending: representatives of 
the California/International Arts Foundation.

4 SAN DIEGANS IN BED OF PICKUP TRUCK KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three children and a pregnant woman, all from San Diego, were killed when they 
were thrown from the bed of a pickup truck that was struck from behind by 
another vehicle on the shoulder of a freeway, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Sunday night when a Toyota pickup truck driven by a 
35-year-old man plowed into the back of a Ford truck, loaded with 13 people, 
that was stopped on the paved shoulder of the Santa Ana Freeway, California 
Highway Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Michael K. Andersen of Whittier was booked for investigation of 
felony drunk driving and manslaughter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen's truck, outfitted as a utility vehicle containing carpenter's 
equipment, was moving "about 60 to 65 m.p.h." when the accident occurred 
shortly before 11 p.m., CHP Officer Dave Boyland said. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were in the cab of the Ford, 10 were in the bed, and one boy was 
standing next to the pickup, which was stopped on the shoulder of the 
southbound lanes of the freeway just north of Pioneer Boulevard, Boyland said. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped on the shoulder because a little boy, 7 years old, had to go to 
the bathroom," Boyland said. " . . . He went into the bushes, and that's when 
Andersen came down with his utility carpenter truck and wiped everybody out." 
</P>
<P>
Boyland said he believed all the victims were related and were returning home 
to the San Diego area after an outing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office identified those killed as Angelica 
Flores, 22, and her 2-year-old daughter, Vanessa Figueroa, both of San Ysidro; 
Ernestina Sanchez, 13, and Ernesto Sanchez Jr., 4, both of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
CHP investigators said they were told that Flores was seven months pregnant, 
but coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said that could not be confirmed pending 
an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 other injured passengers were treated at five hospitals. Two were in 
critical condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. They were identified 
as Irma Flores, 20, of San Ysidro, suffering head injuries, and a 7-year-old 
girl with multiple fractures who underwent surgery to remove her spleen, a 
hospital spokesman said. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Two hospitalized at Norwalk Community Hospital were described in stable 
condition, but their names were also not released. Six other victims were 
treated at hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
Results of blood alcohol tests on Andersen were not immediately available, 
Boyland said. 
</P>
<P>
"He admits to drinking two beers," the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect remained jailed Monday at the Norwalk Sheriff's Station in lieu of 
$50,000 bail. Arraignment was set for Wednesday in Downey Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Motor Vehicles records showed Andersen had been cited in 
1985 for driving with a suspended license, in 1988 for speeding and in 1989 for 
changing lanes without due caution. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's crash kept all southbound freeway lanes closed for about seven 
hours as Caltrans crews cleared the wreckage from the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, children under age 12 may ride in the back of a pickup 
truck if an adult is present, according to CHP spokeswoman Lydia Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended 11 years ago that states 
prohibit all passengers from riding in the rear of open-bed cargo trucks.

AREA ANALYSTS SAY EARLY CENSUS COUNT MISSED 3,700 PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entire housing tracts in Oak Park and the city of Ventura were missed during 
early census counts, so Ventura County's population of 650,880 should be 
increased by at least 3,700 residents before the count becomes final in 
December, city and county analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts, who have pored over preliminary U.S. Census Bureau figures since 
the numbers were released two weeks ago, also said they question the bureau's 
finding that more than 6% of the county's dwellings are vacant. A recent state 
estimate was only 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, planners in most area cities and at the county praised the 
bureau's early work, saying that the large undercounts of 1970 and 1980 seem to 
have been avoided this year. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of the places we've checked we're finding they are quite accurate," 
county senior planner Steve Wood said. But verification by local analysts is 
limited to comparing the number of dwellings reported by the census with local 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Using that method, area analysts found that the initial canvass failed to 
include up to 900 houses in suburban Oak Park east of Thousand Oaks and some 
300 dwellings in a mobile home park and in Rancho Ventura in eastern Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme also has reported to the Census Bureau an undercount of about 140 
dwellings, mostly in a newly completed subdivision on Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
If the size of each of the 1,340 uncounted dwellings discovered so far matches 
the county average of 2.8 residents, about 3,700 people were not included in 
the preliminary population count. 
</P>
<P>
That prompts concern, because Ventura County and its 10 cities all receive some 
tax money in proportion to their populations. Officials said each extra person 
brings the county $200 a year in state and federal subsidies, while an extra 
city resident brings it about $50 through vehicle fees and gas and cigarette 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The extra residents in unincorporated Oak Park will bring the county about 
$500,000 a year. The uncounted residents in Ventura would mean a windfall of 
$42,000 for the city each year. 
</P>
<P>
Geary-Ellen Williams, manager of the census office in Ventura, confirmed 
problems with the Oak Park preliminary count. 
</P>
<P>
"People called in and said they didn't receive our questionnaire," she said. 
Census workers have since canvassed that community, counting residents in each 
unlisted home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point of giving the cities this preliminary information is so they 
can help us get an accurate count," Williams said. When releasing the early 
figures Aug. 27, the Census Bureau said it expected upward revisions. 
</P>
<P>
City and county planners have another week to complete their check of the 
figures and to file a challenge. But representatives of seven cities said 
Monday that they have seen little to indicate that the preliminary count is far 
off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, where the census numbers were about 3,600 residents below 
state estimates, senior planner John Prescott said his check shows that the 
federal figures jibe with the city's. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has 37,500 dwellings, the city estimates, while the federal count 
is 37,748. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it looks like the difference is going to be less than 1%," he said. 
"You want zero percent, but in some of these areas we don't even have a 
complete count ourselves for April 1." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census is intended to reflect population for April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difference between federal and local figures reflects new dwellings 
completed between Jan. 1, when the census did its initial count, and April 1. 
</P>
<P>
However, federal officials said they were not sure how hundreds of older homes 
were missed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Ventura, the two uncounted subdivisions are well established, 
planner Mark Stephens said. "Those are the two most significant discrepancies 
we see," he said, "but we'll spend the next few days going back and checking 
our figures against theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Planning Director Bill Prince said about the only thing he has found to 
challenge is an undercount of 22 people. The city found 212 senior citizens in 
retirement homes instead of 190 as reported by federal canvassers. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, representatives of several cities said they question dwelling 
vacancy rates reported in the census. In Santa Paula, chief of planning Joan 
Kus said she knows of virtually no vacant houses or apartments, while the 
census says the city has 526 out of a total of 8,077. 
</P>
<P>
"Their figure is kind of ridiculous based on common knowledge," Kus said. 
</P>
<P>
Under census guidelines, vacancy rates are not subject to challenge, Kus said. 
But she plans to ask Ventura County to file a protest on behalf of all area 
cities since the rate in the census is nearly double the state's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Even before revisions upward, Ventura County's population of nearly 651,000 is 
an increase of 122,000 over the past decade. That 23% rate of growth is 
slightly under the 24% rate for California during the 1980s.

TARGETING GANGS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARILLO: EFFORTS TO RID ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OF YOUTH CRIME AND GRAFFITI IS 
YIELDING RESULTS. RESIDENTS SAY THE CITY SEEMS MORE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An aggressive program to keep gangs and their graffiti out of Camarillo's Barry 
Street neighborhood has won praise from residents and the owner of the area's 
only market. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo city workers sandblast or paint over the scrawled messages and 
symbols within 24 hours after their appearance, preventing gang members from 
advertising for new recruits or starting fights with rivals, law enforcement 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The city recently paved the dirt alleys that once collected rainwater and 
trash, contributing to what was an overall rundown appearance of the 
neighborhood east of Arneill Road and south of the Ventura Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Also, Crime Prevention Officer Rodney Mendoza said he regularly visits schools 
that serve the predominantly Latino neighborhood. He said the visits are 
intended to help keep students in class and away from drugs and street games. 
</P>
<P>
The program has kept the current generation from following elder brothers and 
neighbors into the kind of trouble that gave the Barry Street area a bad name 
10 years ago, Mendoza said. Now, most of the street toughs who once caused such 
crimes as beatings and burglaries and problems such as harassment are gone, 
Mendoza and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to be called the bad guys," said Armando Fernandez Delara, a 10-year 
resident of the neighborhood who knew many of the rabble-rousers. "Some of the 
guys who used to write on the walls and cause the trouble, they have good jobs 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Magana, who grew up on Barry Street, said: "A lot of people grew up and 
got married and some of the other guys are still in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Guerra, a Lomita Street resident, agreed that the area is much calmer 
now than in recent years. He said the city seems to be more committed to the 
neighborhood, which numbers about 1,000 people, through the removal of 
graffiti, cleanup of alleys and a quick response from police on calls. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more visible signs that the neighborhood is coming back, the 
former Deleon's Market, now Chole's Market, is free from spray paint and 
writing that two years ago marred the two-story building at Glenn Drive and 
Lomita Street. 
</P>
<P>
The sign at the market, which offers a variety of Mexican specialty food items, 
is repaired and remains intact. No longer do groups of teen-age boys and young 
adults hang around while drinking beer, talking loudly, fighting and scaring 
away customers, said Chole's owner, Patricia Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, they wanted to take over the neighborhood," she said. "They 
wanted my store for their hangout. But I've been able to talk to my people and 
I say 'Look, it's not good for my business and it's not good for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a 26-year-old neighborhood newcomer from Oxnard, who bought the store 
18 months ago, said the first year in the neighborhood was the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, I pretty much know everybody by name," she said. "I just keep talking 
to them, treating them like people. If they break my sign, I find out who it 
is. Then, when he comes in my store to buy a soda, I ask him, 'Hey, what's 
wrong, don't you like me?' " 
</P>
<P>
The confrontations usually end in an understanding, if not an admission of 
guilt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The police back her up when she needs them, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Camarillo's onetime rough end of town is not problem-free. A few of the 
toughs are still around, and not every resident feels as positive about police 
protection as Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Street resident Lupe Bernal needed help from police recently when a 
relative, she said, became drunk and threatened her. But no one responded after 
two calls for help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'It's just Mexicans over there,' they think," Bernal said. " 'Let them stab 
one another.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bernal's grown daughter, Angelina Jacquez, who lives with her family on Ventura 
Boulevard a few blocks south, said police respond quickly in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"When I call them down to the boulevard, they are quick," she said. "I think 
the police are just fed up with the whole Barry Street area." 
</P>
<P>
Police said there was no record of calls from Barry Street on their logs. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems aside, both Bernal and Jacquez like the clean, new look of the 
neighborhood and are grateful that most of the area's youths seem to stay out 
of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen an improvement with the graffiti," Jacquez said. "And we have 
been real lucky not to have any gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Police say it's more than luck. They make it a point to know the names of the 
youths who are potential gang members in both of Camarillo's predominantly 
low-income neighborhoods, said Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Ray Abbott, who 
heads Camarillo's law enforcement team. And they keep track of their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the makings of some gangs," Abbott said. "We've got the Barry Street 
Boys and another group over on Raemere Street," he said, referring to the 
city's other predominantly low-income area, a single street of duplexes west of 
Arneill Road. "But we believe at this point it is more of a turf thing than 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said there have been no significant disturbances in the Barry Street 
area in the past two years since a group of boys overturned a car belonging to 
a woman on Lomita Street. 
</P>
<P>
And police still watch the city's onetime third problem area in west Camarillo, 
off Las Posas Road, where a group of white supremacists who called themselves 
Skinheads harassed neighbors 18 months ago. The area is quiet now, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said the outlook is good for a continued recovery of the Barry Street 
neighborhood, which consists of small houses.

"More people are taking pride in their homes and their community," Abbott said. 
Raemere Street is almost exclusively a rental area where the same pride does 
not exist, Sgt. Paul Oechsle said. He added, however, that Raemere Street never 
had the crime problems that the Barry Street area had.

Meanwhile, back on Lomita Street, Guerra said he liked his neighborhood. He 
looked out from his front patio, where he was lounging with friends, and saw a 
man ringing a small bell and pushing an ice cream cart down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We even have door-to-door ice cream," he said. "What more do you want?"

2 GIRLS TESTIFY AT MOLESTATION TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two 15-year-old girls testified Monday in an ongoing molestation trial that 
their Camarillo High School drama teacher hugged them and made them feel 
uncomfortable during classes. 
</P>
<P>
One girl testified in Ventura County Municipal Court that William Fisher, 42, 
held her hand and hugged her while she was wearing a bikini during a private 
play rehearsal last November. During cross-examination by defense attorney 
George Eskin, the girl said that Fisher was following the same stage directions 
as the student actor he was substituting for. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is being tried under a state law that makes it a misdemeanor for someone 
to "annoy or molest a child under 18." Eight of his female students complained 
that he inappropriately hugged them, held their hands or made sexual remarks to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. O'Brien played a videotape for the 
jury of Fisher showing photographs of himself in women's clothing to the other 
15-year-old girl. Since the trial began on Thursday, she was the fifth girl to 
testify that Fisher had shown her such photographs in the school's theater. 
</P>
<P>
In the four cases that the jury saw on videotape, Fisher behaved in a similar 
manner with each girl: he sat with the girl in chairs facing away from the 
camera and talked for a few moments about the girl's school or social life. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes show Fisher producing photographs of himself in women's clothing, 
asking the girl to look at them and picking out a favorite picture, then 
walking out of the camera's view with the promise, "I'll be right back." In 
each tape, Fisher returns 30 to 90 seconds later and sits down, discusses the 
girl's impressions of the photographs, then gathers them up and leaves the 
theater with her. 
</P>
<P>
No one has testified about who made the tapes. Testimony by prosecution 
witnesses is expected to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher pleaded guilty to four counts of misdemeanor child molestation but 
changed his plea to not guilty last June after learning that he could be 
sentenced to jail. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail 
and a $1,000 fine. MACK REED

MERCHANTS ASK CITY TO EASE SIGN LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Camarillo merchants displeased with city sign restrictions want the right to 
use neon signs and banners now banned without special permits. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers have complained to the city and the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce 
since inspectors began issuing citations and warnings this summer. Some 
merchants were cited for longstanding practices, said Gary L. Wartik, chamber 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the ordinance is well-intentioned, avoiding sign blight like in 
L. A.," said Wartik, who is fielding members' complaints for a negotiating 
session with the City Council next month. "We don't want garish displays or 
billboards, just improved visibility for businesses in town." 
</P>
<P>
The council has responded in part to complaints by easing restrictions on 
sidewalk sales, previously limited to twice a year with a special-event permit. 
Planning Director Anthony Boden said that under new guidelines, retailers could 
hold sidewalk sales every weekend without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers also take issue with a prohibition on signs covering more than 25% of 
storefront windows, and then only as sales or special-event announcements. Neon 
beer signs and banners are banned under the ordinance, except "Grand Opening" 
banners that must come down within 30 days, Wartik said. 
</P>
<P>
Boden maintained that Camarillo's size limits on store-name signs -- one square 
foot for every two feet of storefront -- is among the least restrictive in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to maintain some standards," Boden said. "We don't want sidewalk 
sales becoming permanent sales that spill into the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Terhune, manager of a Pay Less Drug Store on Las Posas Road, was warned 
about regularly selling garden-shop items from its sidewalk. He has not yet 
withdrawn the plants and ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the best garden sales last year of any store in our district, which 
includes Los Angeles and Orange counties," Terhune said. "It would definitely 
restrain our trade to remove things that I and my customers find attractive."

PROPOSED JAIL FEE COULD COST CITY $550,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new fee being considered by the county Board of Supervisors to pay for the 
cost of booking prisoners into County Jail may drain the financially strapped 
city of Oxnard of $550,000 annually, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
The report by Oxnard Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer, released last 
week, said the supervisors are considering charging each city in the county a 
fee of $120 for each prisoner booked into the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
In adopting its latest budget, state lawmakers approved legislation allowing 
counties to pass such costs on to the cities. The Board of Supervisors will 
discuss the fee during a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the county would not charge cities for bookings related to 
warrants, court orders and other such cases. Allowing for such exemptions, the 
report said the Oxnard Police Department had 4,600 bookings during fiscal year 
1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Although the booking fee would not become effective until Jan. 1, 1991, the 
report said the proposal before the county would make the fee retroactively 
applicable to July 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, City Manager Vernon G. Hazen said the fee would hurt 
the financially strapped city. "It seems to be just one thing on top of the 
other," he said, adding that Mayor Nao Takasugi is expected to protest the fee 
at today's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens said the fee could force the city to scrutinize all 
misdemeanor arrests and "reduce to the lowest level the people we book through 
the County Jail." 
</P>
<P>
The city could avoid the fee by building its own jail or charging the booking 
cost to the arrested suspect. But Owens called those solutions unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the California Police Chiefs Assn. is planning to lobby the 
state Legislature to repeal the legislation that allows the county to pass on 
the fees to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't see any immediate solutions that would be satisfactory to everyone 
concerned," he said. HUGO MARTIN

MARCHERS PROTEST MAN'S DEATH IN JAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
About 100 people turned out for a march in Santa Paula during the weekend to 
protest the death of 23-year-old Daniel Guajardo, who died in a Santa Paula 
jail cell last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We held the vigil to let everyone know that the Hispanic community is tired of 
being harassed by Santa Paula police," said Frank Gaona, Guajardo's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
He and other relatives and friends of the dead man suspect foul play on the 
part of officers in the death. 
</P>
<P>
But police officials deny the accusations and say Guajardo probably died of a 
delayed reaction to cocaine or that he may have smuggled drugs into jail with 
him and then overdosed. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of cocaine 
Sept. 4. Ten hours later, he was found dead in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicology reports that might verify whether he died of an overdose may not be 
finished for more than seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Police said my nephew died at 3:15 Tuesday morning," Gaona said. "But no one 
called my niece, his wife, until 6 in the morning. And then they wouldn't let 
anyone, not even his wife or mother, see his body for the next two days. Why? 
Reports show they never took him to the hospital, they just rushed him straight 
to the coroner. My nephew's death was totally out of hand."

Irvine -- Irvine Councilwoman Paula Werner was quoted out of context in a story 
Friday. Werner's comment, "It's all coming down to partisan politics, when we 
should be concentrating on local issues," did not refer to the controversy over 
seating Mary Ann Gaido on the council but to Measure F, which seeks to move 
city elections from June to November.

County economy -- A bar graph accompanying an article published Sunday about 
the county's economy was mislabeled. The graph made it appear that the total 
amount of leased office space in 1990 is about 300,000 square feet. Actually, 
that figure is the projected net increase in leased office space this year, a 
figure roughly equal to the increases of the previous two years.

ROONEY TO AID VICTIMS OF VANDALS

Entertainer Mickey Rooney offered today to pay for the repainting of a black 
couple's Agoura Hills home, which was vandalized last month by intruders who 
painted red swastikas and racial epithets on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two years that vandals had broken into the home of 
the Szebelski L. Freeman, 68, and his wife Matilda, 69. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to spray-painting the walls, the vandals slashed chairs and 
curtains, destroyed photographs and appliances, overturned an aquarium and 
placed the fish in a bowl filled with manure, causing about $30,000 worth of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his publicist today, Rooney offered to pay for the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"It sickens me to see people like the Freemans suffering this way. We fought 
World War II to wipe swastikas off the face of the Earth. I think everyone has 
to do his or her share to see that hate crimes are wiped out as well."

JAPAN WEIGHS $2 BILLION IN AID; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE MONEY WOULD GO TO NATIONS HIT HARDEST BY SANCTIONS ON IRAQ.

Japan, chided for moving slowly to aid the international campaign against Iraq, 
is considering giving $2 billion to the three nations hit hardest by the 
economic sanctions on Iraq, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The aid would go to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, said Hiroyasu Horio, an official 
with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
News reports said the aid would be extended through the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund and that $600 million would be sent as early as 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said figures were not decided but 
that the government is moving to set them quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In another development today, Iraq informed U.S. officials that American males 
residing in Iraq and Kuwait who were born in Arab countries will be allowed to 
return to the United States, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Iraqis generally had not allowed American males to leave, 
restricting departures to U.S. women and children. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he had no estimate on the 
number of American males who will be eligible to leave under the new rules. 
There are an estimated 1,700 Americans in Kuwait and 100 in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has already promised a $1-billion aid package for multinational 
peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia, including food, water, vehicles and 
prefabricated housing for non-military uses. But critics in the United States 
have complained that Japan should do more since its economy depends heavily on 
oil from the Middle East. Japan imports 99% of its oil. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that when the total shape of our contribution is clearly shown, this 
kind of criticism will be greatly reduced," Watanabe said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of (the criticisms) are based on a lack of knowledge about what we are 
doing and some of them are affected by previously held perceptions of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Japan's constitution bans the use of force in settling international disputes, 
and Japanese law restricts the military to Japanese territory, except for 
participation in ceremonial occasions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But Horio said the Trade Ministry is considering chartering foreign airplanes 
to send provisions "as soon as possible" for the multinational forces, possibly 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure from abroad is getting so strong," Horio said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the constitution, Japanese airlines and unions have demanded the 
government limit items they carry to non-military goods and refused to fly over 
dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
When Japan last week sent a Panamanian ship loaded with 800 vehicles and other 
equipment for the international peacekeeping effort in the Middle East, its 
departure was held up for hours by negotiations with a seamen's union that had 
refused to enter the troubled region. 
</P>
<P>
Horio said the government plans to send more vehicles, 2,000 trucks and 100 
buses for the Gulf forces. But he refused to provide details or the date of 
departure "to eliminate unnecessary trouble before the departure." 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service, quoting unnamed sources, said the government is considering 
sending military personnel overseas by temporarily transferring them to a new 
"peace cooperation team" to support U.N. activities. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said nothing has been decided on that.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. said today that Supreme 
Court nominee David H. Souter should answer specific questions on abortion and 
other politically volatile issues at his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"At this fateful moment in our history we have a right to know" the answers to 
such questions, said Biden (D-Del.) 
</P>
<P>
.As Judiciary Committee chairman, he will preside over the hearings on Souter's 
nomination, scheduled to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the National Organization for Women charged that 
Souter's nomination is part of a right-wing campaign to stack the court with 
justices hostile to the rights of women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
NOW President Molly Yard told a news conference that Souter is "almost 
Neanderthal" and that his record indicates that he would vote to overturn the 
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"You're literally talking about women's lives," she said. "That's what's at 
stake." 
</P>
<P>
Biden brushed aside any notion that it would be wrong to force a Supreme Court 
nominee to give his views on such matters as abortion, civil rights and freedom 
of religion that will come before the court. 
</P>
<P>
"All signs point to the need for very extensive, detailed questioning of this 
nominee," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has not decided yet whether the federal judge from New Hampshire 
should be confirmed. But he did acknowledge that "a number of questions have 
been raised in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
He called the nomination "the most important business to come before the Senate 
this year" and said Souter's impact on the court will linger "long after (Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein has bitten the dust, long after the current budget 
crisis has been replaced by some other fiscal dilemma."

America has virtually abandoned the seriously mentally ill who cannot afford to 
pay for treatment, says a report released today by two advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people with schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis live 
in public shelters, on the streets and in prisons and jails, the report by 
Public Citizen and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill said. 
</P>
<P>
Many others among the nation's 2 million seriously mentally ill cannot afford 
medical treatment or adequate housing and live in communities where no 
vocational rehabilitation services are available, the groups say.

Florida's weekly Lotto jackpot was raised to $90 million today as sales 
continued at a pace that could send the game past the $100-million mark before 
Saturday night's drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday there were no winning tickets in a $50-million lottery. 
</P>
<P>
For the jackpot to reach $100 million, lottery officials calculate, the state 
will have to sell $98 million in tickets this week. The record is $56 million 
in sales in one week. 
</P>
<P>
The national record for a lottery prize is $115 million, which was awarded in 
Pennsylvania to 14 ticket-holders, some of them individuals and some groups. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. record for the largest single lottery prize goes to Sheelah Ryan 
of Winter Springs, Fla., who won a Lotto jackpot of $55.1 million in 1988.

SOVIET UNION: HE REJECTS PRIME MINISTER RYZHKOV'S MODERATE PLAN, FAVORING A 
QUICKER MOVE TO A FREE MARKET.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev went before Parliament today and rejected the 
moderate economic plan his prime minister had just presented to the body, 
instead endorsing a more radical blueprint for a 500-day switch-over to a 
market economy. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning statement reflected dwindling confidence in Prime Minister Nikolai 
I. Ryzhkov and put Gorbachev closer to the position of radical reformers such 
as Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the Russian republic president, asked the republic's Parliament last 
week to approve a radical reform plan drafted by Stanislav Shatalin, a 
Gorbachev aide. 
</P>
<P>
Shatalin's plan would transfer enormous authority from Parliament to the 
legislatures of the republics, which would then have the power to scrap 
centralized economic planning, introduce market mechanisms and legalize private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev rejected Ryzhkov's plan but said elements of it would be combined 
with Shatalin's plan. He said the Shatalin program appeals more to him because 
it integrates "the ideas of constituent republics." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a real plan to stabilize finances, money circulation, the ruble 
and the market, then we should adopt the Shatalin idea," Gorbachev said. "We 
should try and work out a single document, and we are nearing it." 
</P>
<P>
He has avoided explicitly expressing a lack of confidence in Ryzhkov, a close 
ally, but his statements sparked new speculation that Ryzhkov would step down 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he would present a plan on Wednesday that would be very close to 
the more radical plan proposed earlier by Yeltsin. A commission with members 
appointed by the two men has been trying to draft a common document for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov's speech drew fire from lawmakers in the national legislature, and 
Gorbachev responded with a warning against "shaking up all the political 
institutions in the country," the Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable. In this case, we shall bury everything we have achieved 
over these five years," said Gorbachev, who became general secretary of the 
Soviet Communist Party in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
No prime minister in 73 years of Soviet history has been forced to resign 
because Parliament refused to endorse his program.

The practice of inmates wrestling and fighting with tracking dogs at the end of 
training exercises was temporarily halted today by the state prison board. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice unanimously approved the 
recommendations of a board subcommittee that the "contact" practice be 
suspended until inmates have more protective gear and policies are in place to 
ensure that only volunteers are used for the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, an inmate would be given a head start and go into hiding or climb a 
tree, and then, when the inmate was located by the dog, he would briefly fight 
with the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The dog training came under fire after board Vice Chairman Jerry Hodge took two 
companions on an inmate hunt for sport. Hodge later had jackets made for them 
that dubbed the trip "The Ultimate Hunt." He has since apologized for the 
jackets.

EVANSTON ADOPTS TAX ON COLLEGE TUITION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MAYOR SAYS SHE WILL VETO THE NATION'S FIRST SUCH MEASURE. 
NORTHWESTERN U. SAYS IT WILL SUE THE CITY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council in this Chicago suburb has approved the nation's first tax on 
college tuition, voting to charge students at Northwestern University and three 
other schools up to $60 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Joan Barr immediately said she will veto the measure, and Northwestern 
threatened to take the city to court. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe Evanston should be the very first community in the United 
States to tax education," the mayor said. "Evanston has always taken pride in 
its educational excellence." 
</P>
<P>
The measure was approved 10 to 8 Monday night to make up for the property taxes 
from which the schools are exempt and to give tax relief to homeowners who saw 
higher bills in this community of 73,000 because of reassessment last year. 
</P>
<P>
The council could override a veto by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
The tax of $15 per semester -- or per quarter, depending on how the school's 
academic year is set up -- would generate an estimated $500,000 a year toward 
the city's budget, which totaled $77.3 million in 1990-91, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would apply to three other schools -- Kendall College, Garrett 
Evangelical Theological Seminary and Seabury-Western Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate Monday night centered on Northwestern and its unwillingness to 
pay the city for police and fire protection. The university has its own 
security force but occasionally asks for assistance from Evanston police. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are asking for is a basic principle, and that is a fair share," said 
Alderman Jack Korshak, who proposed the measure. "Five dollars a month. Each of 
you can judge for yourself the extent to which this represents an insuperable 
burden to a student." 
</P>
<P>
University President Arnold Weber argued Northwestern students couldn't handle 
the extra $60 because more than half of them already receive extensive 
financial aid. Most of the school's nearly 10,500 students are undergraduates 
who pay tuition of $13,725 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Weber called the tax "anti-education" and "anti-business" and said it would 
destroy the relationship between the city and its educational institutions. 
Northwestern, which owns 242 of the 5,400 acres in the community, has said it 
is typical for such institutions to be exempt from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have focused on Northwestern -- the big, the bad, and apparently, the 
ugly," said Alderman David Nelson, who voted against the tax. "There are 
apparently going to be others caught up in the maelstrom." 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern officials have promised a court fight. They have pointed out that 
the school brings about 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pumps millions of 
dollars into the local economy and adds many cultural advantages. 
</P>
<P>
No other U.S. city has a tuition tax, said Sheldon E. Steinbach, vice president 
and general counsel of the American Council on Education in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The council represents 1,500 colleges and universities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goritz, an Evanston resident and a lawyer, argued that the tax would not 
stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what verbiage you put on the measure, it's a tax on the occupation 
of being a student," he said.

Got a cellular phone, dude? Better check it in at the counter. 
</P>
<P>
Theaters, restaurants and other businesses are increasingly banning the 
portable phones, as customers complain of the impolite user. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they need them. Suddenly everyone's a doctor," said manager Fredd 
Selgas of the Coconut Grove Playhouse, where patrons are urged to check their 
phones at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about people taking calls in the middle of movies led to a ban on 
the phones at all 18 Florida theaters owned by Wometco. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Wometco general manager John Wray said. "You're in the middle 
of a tense love scene and someone's phone rings, and a guy says, 'Hi, 
sweetheart. How're you doing?' 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's a disturbing effect to the patrons and, as a courtesy, they 
should not bring their phones in." 
</P>
<P>
With the use of cellular phones increasing, cities may take legislative action. 
In the Florida Statehouse, the phones are banned from Senate and House floors, 
as well as in the public galleries above. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in the future could get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be like smoking -- they'll have a phone section and a non-phone 
section," said Alfonso Blanco, manager of a cellular phone store.

FAILING BANKS MAY DRAIN NATIONAL INSURANCE FUND

The nation's bank deposit insurance funds could be wiped out by losses that 
banks are experiencing from declining real estate values and risky investments, 
congressional auditors said today. 
</P>
<P>
At least 35 of the nation's 200 largest banks are likely to fail or require 
assistance over the next year at a cost to the government of $4.4 billion to 
$6.3 billion, the General Accounting Office said in a report to the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the federal system of 
deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such a period of danger and 
uncertainty," Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher said. "We have a lot of 
situations out there that could wipe the fund out." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. already faces losses of $2 billion this 
year atop losses of $5.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the accounting office said. 
In addition, it said, the FDIC has a contingent liability of $8 billion for 
troubled loans now held by the acquirers of already-failed banks in Texas.

A Swiss bank will guarantee part of the $375 million Philadelphia is seeking,

<P>
Swiss Bank Corp. will back $50 million of the temporary loan notes the 
administration of Mayor W. Wilson Goode is trying to sell to raise cash, the 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported today. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and a financial team headed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets are 
trying to persuade at least two other banks to guarantee additional notes. 
</P>
<P>
John Chamales, Swiss Bank first vice president, said the bank is prepared to 
issue a letter of credit for as much as $225 million if other banks subcontract 
for the other $175 million and assume some of the risk, the newspaper reported.

DOW SLIPS 2.97 AS OIL PRICES STEADY

Wall Street stocks closed with modest losses today, as a relatively calm day in 
the oil markets provided a respite for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.97 points at 2,612.62. In the 
broader market, declining issues led advancers by a 4-3 margin. Volume on the 
New York Stock Exchange was a light 113.22 million shares against 119.73 the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that with oil prices little changed, there were few factors to 
affect the stock market. The benchmark U.S. grade of oil closed down 30 cents 
at $31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The market continued to show some concern about higher oil prices, analysts 
said. On Monday, the Dow closed 3.96 points lower after oil prices spurted 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also remain wary about interest rates, analysts say. Rumors over the 
last few days have said the Federal Reserve was about to ease rates, but the 
central bank failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
An additional uncertainty in the market was the fate of budget negotiations in 
Washington, said William R. Rothe, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp; 
Sons Inc. in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Rothe said there are "too many issues that remain unresolved" for investors to 
commit money to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The market received no help from abroad. Stock prices closed lower in Japan and 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Among most-active blue chip issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T was up 1/2 at 30 7/8, 
Philip Morris rose 1/8 to 45 and IBM rose 3/8 to 106 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.50 to 176.20. 
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.33 to 322.88. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were little changed in early trading today as most players sat on 
the sidelines waiting for some news that could move the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or nearly 94 cents per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
price, fell to 8.95% from 8.96% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading was very light as investors waited for further news from 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
They also were watching budget talks in Washington, where negotiators passed a 
self-imposed Monday deadline for reaching agreement on $50 billion in spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, which helped send the bond market lower Monday, were relatively 
stable today. The near-term contract for light, sweet crude oil was off 15 
cents to $31.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning.

semifinal in addition to first-round matches. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, the first to be played in the United States, will be held in 
eight to 12 cities in June and July, 1994. Cities will be selected next year by 
soccer's world governing body, FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point our intentions are to bid," Johnson said. He said the problem of 
installing grass over the artificial turf could be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven cities, including Los Angeles and Pasadena, have indicated that 
they will bid for games by the Dec. 14 deadline. Berlin said Denver's Mile High 
Stadium probably will join the list.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters tournament, has accepted 
its first black member. 
</P>
<P>
Club Chairman Hord Hardin said today that Augusta accepted "seven or eight" new 
members and a "black gentleman" was among them. 
</P>
<P>
"We now can confirm we do have a black member," Hardin said today, adding that 
it is club policy not to disclose names of its members. "I don't intend to 
disclose their names. The black gentleman was one of seven or eight new 
members." 
</P>
<P>
During last month's PGA Championship at Shoal Creek in Birmingham, Ala., there 
was an uproar over the club's exclusionary membership policies. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Aug. 9-12 event, Hardin said Augusta already was considering 
blacks for membership. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's going to work," Hardin said today. "I think as he settles in he 
will enjoy being a member, and we will enjoy having him as a member." 
</P>
<P>
Hardin said in today's editions of the Augusta Chronicle that the club's first 
black member "should have a chance to be a member, rather than to be some 
oddity." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Shoal Creek controversy, the Professional Golfers' Assn. of 
America, the PGA Tour and the U.S. Golf Assn. adopted new guidelines requiring 
private clubs that wish to play host to tournaments to demonstrate that they do 
not discriminate against minorities or women. 
</P>
<P>
The Masters is a private tournament under the auspices of Augusta National, not 
under the jurisdiction of the PGA. Unlike many clubs, where there are long 
waiting lists to join, membership at Augusta is by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at CBS, which televises the Masters, had talks with Augusta 
National officials regarding membership policy, and civil rights leaders had 
announced plans to protest next spring's Masters if the club were not 
integrated. 
</P>
<P>
After the Shoal Creek controversy, CBS was assured by Augusta officials that 
"they were taking steps to ensure that the tournaments we televise would have 
non-exclusionary membership policies," said Susan Kerr, director of 
communications for CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said today that she was unaware of any communications between the club and 
CBS Sports regarding the club's new black member. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, who had vowed 
to protest the Masters if Augusta National remained all white, said today he 
was pleased by reports of a black member.

"It's a good first step," Lowery said. "I hope they go on to admit women, do 
business with black-owned businesses, support athletic programs at black 
colleges, use black vendors at their activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just talking about membership. We've got to move beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
Augusta National reportedly has no women members, although wives of members are 
allowed to play the course. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who was active in the Shoal Creek dispute, said he was not personally 
notified of the move to desegregate Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the new member is someone who also was 
the first black member at another private golf club.

SHOAL CREEK FOUNDER CASTS DOUBTS ON FUTURE TOURNEYS

Shoal Creek founder Hall Thompson said the country club might never host 
another major golf tournament because of the controversy that developed over 
its membership during the PGA Championship last month. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Birmingham businessman made his first public comments since the 
controversy when he presented a check for $25,000 to the Shelby County 
Commission to help defray the $52,000 in overtime that sheriff's deputies were 
paid during the tournament Aug. 9-12. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was quoted in a newspaper story on June 21 as saying the all-white 
club would not be pressured into accepting a black member. After blacks 
threatened protests during the tournament and sponsors began pulling their 
television advertising, the club accepted a black as an honorary member. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek also hosted the PGA Championship in 1984, but Thompson told the 
county commission, "We may or may not have another championship because of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he had been "sorely abused" during the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, "Our membership doesn't deserve to be treated as it has been."

BOB GELDOF IS BACK UNDER ORIGINAL GUISE: MUSICIAN 
</P>

<P>
Bob Geldof, musician, is back. 
</P>
<P>
Not St. Bob, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not Sir Bob, 
knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1986, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize that 
same year. Not author Bob, who's already written a best-selling autobiography, 
"Is That It?" And not businessman Bob, who oversaw millions and millions of 
dollars in contributions for the starving Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees of Band Aid, although he says 
the organization will cease to exist fairly soon. But his main focus these days 
is "The Vegetarians of Love," his critically acclaimed second solo album. 
</P>
<P>
This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; Geldof has instead 
assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion, violins, flute, tin 
whistle, mandolin and ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on the radio which I 
don't like -- basically, house music and New Kids on the Block or Kylie 
Minogue," Geldof said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
For the new album, Geldof enlisted an old friend -- ex-Rats bassist Pete 
Briquette -- and four traditional musicians he had never met. They recorded 28 
songs in five days; any song that didn't click after three takes was thrown 
out. Geldof improvised many of the lyrics on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The spontaneity shows. On "A Gospel Song," Geldof tells the band "middle eight 
coming up" during an instrumental break. Geldof asks at the start of another 
cut, "Are we rolling?" And at the end of "The Great Song of Indifference," the 
entire band is heard laughing loudly. 
</P>
<P>
"Indifference" is already a Top 40 hit in Britain. "The last thing everybody 
expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a big dance hit, you know? 
Thirteenth-Century dance music," said Geldof, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown Rats, Geldof 
became a household name in 1984 by organizing the cream of British musicians to 
record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for African famine 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by USA for Africa's "We Are the World" and the 
internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years, Geldof met with 
heads of state and political power brokers; the scruffy Irishman was 
photographed with everyone from Nobelist Mother Teresa to British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the realization that 
there was only so much that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or world hunger. I 
said it was a Band-Aid. 'You don't put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,' if I 
remember, was the quote at the time," Geldof said. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to raise the issue to 
the top of the political agenda, and we did that."

LIZ SMITH: GEOGRAPHY SEPARATES BARBARA WALTERS, MERV ADELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
IT IS WITH great sadness that Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson are announcing 
that they will be having a trial separation. For the last five years, this 
glamorous and very nice couple has lived a high-intensity, bi-coastal wedlock, 
with each traveling from coast-to-coast at least once a month. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Merv's business interests require his spending most of his time in Los 
Angeles and Barbara's television assignments, instead of lessening, seem to 
have multiplied so that she is traveling all over the world or operating 
primarily from New York. The twain meets -- but the effort is gigantic. 
</P>
<P>
Merv has always had, and continues to have, total respect for Barbara's career 
and has never suggested she give it up. But when he sold his company, Lorimar 
Telepictures, to Warner Brothers, his business requirements changed and he was 
not in New York as much as he had been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The many friends of the couple on both coasts know that Merv and Barbara are 
still deeply devoted to each other. It sounds like a cliche, but I believe they 
will remain the closest of friends. 
</P>
<P>
And, being the incurable romantic that I am, I personally hope they will find 
that their separation isn't worth the separation. 
</P>
<P>
PATTI DAVIS isn't going to give up life just because she isn't Mommy and 
Daddy's pet kid. The daughter of Nancy and Ronald Reagan has just signed with 
Carol Publishing for her second novel. She is about three-quarters of the way 
through the new fiction. It will tell the story of a woman's struggle with the 
issue of motherhood (does she want it or not?), and it will contain flashbacks 
of the protagonist's own childhood. "Smoke Signals" is the working title for 
this, and it is due next year. 
</P>
<P>
Patti has also written a book for children coming from Lowell House this fall. 
"Blue and Darby" is about two dolphins. Conventional wisdom has it that the 
Reagans have more or less washed their hands of their rebellious Patti 
precisely because of her pro-dolphin/anti-tuna nets crusade, which seemed 
critical of her father's policies when he occupied the White House. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe you'd like to buy Patti's book if you are a dolphin lover -- as a 
gesture of loyalty. Remember, it's tough being an orphan, especially when your 
parents are living. 
</P>

ENDQUOTE: Sandra Bernhard gives lots of "attitude" in her recent profile by 
People magazine. And her fans like it that way, say the editors. Asked 
constantly throughout about her friendship with Madonna, Sandra gets rather 
definite: "If Madonna and I were really having an affair, I don't think we 
would be talking about it in public. She's a nice friend, and I have a great 
time with her. She has a lot of money and takes me out to dinner. . . . If I 
was really having an affair with her, do you think I'd be here? I'd be in Japan 
spending all her money. If I'm with a man, it's because I'm with a man. If I'm 
with a woman, you know, every woman that I'm seen with I'm not sleeping with. 
And I'm not sleeping with every man, either. Anything goes in my life. I'm an 
adventurous person, and I'm also a very sexual person, and I like interacting 
with a lot of people. I think it's boring to be stuck in one genre. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a lesbian, and I'm sick of being called one. I'm not, and I want to 
set the record straight. . . . I'm going to blow everybody's minds. I'm going 
to get married and belong to Hadassah!"

Spectators at Deauville's annual American film festival picked "Aunt Julia and 
the Scriptwriter," a comedy starring Peter Falk, as their favorite American 
film of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The film, directed by Jon Amiel and based on a novel by Peruvian novelist Mario 
Vargas Llosa, has yet to open in commercial theaters. It is set in the 1950s, 
with Falk playing a writer of radio scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the films at the festival have opened in the United States. Among those 
making premieres in Deauville were "Cadence," the first movie directed by actor 
Martin Sheen, and "Convicts," directed by Peter Masterson and starring Robert 
Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
There is no celebrity jury at Deauville's festival. All voting is by 
spectators.

RAIDERS TO STAY IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
TEAM SIGNS LONG-TERM AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders agreed today to remain in Los Angeles, ending three years of 
intense efforts by a number of California cities to lure the professional 
football team, City Hall officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said a contract was signed between the Raiders and the Los 
Angeles Coliseum's private managers, Spectacor Management Group, shortly after 
8 a.m. today, after negotiations that went late into Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a reason for all football fans and admirers of the Coliseum to 
celebrate," Mayor Tom Bradley said in a statement released at City Hall. The 
mayor is in London on a trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
Team owner Al Davis' decision to stay in the city came after often-extravagant 
bidding for the team -- one of the most successful in the history of 
professional sports -- by Irwindale, Oakland and Sacramento. Even as the 
decision was made, a $127-million offer from the city of Oakland was on Davis' 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
The football team still could be lost to Los Angeles, however, if the 
Coliseum's private managers are unable to come up with an environmental impact 
report allowing a $145-million renovation of the Coliseum, along with private 
financing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation must be completed within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the actual agreement was signed between private parties, Bradley and 
Coliseum Commissioner Bill Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los 
Angeles County Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, were important participants in the 
discussions and put pressure on both sides to come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Final details of the deal between Spectacor and the Raiders were to be 
disclosed at a news conference this afternoon. But one of the negotiators said 
there had been no major changes from last week, when Spectacor made what was 
described as a "final offer" to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The offer called for the team to sign a 20-year lease in exchange for the 
Coliseum renovation, as well as $10 million in advance cash payments by the 
private managers and forgiveness of $10 million the team owed the Coliseum 
Commission from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of the 67-year-old Coliseum is to be accomplished in such a way 
as to allow retention of the historic existing exterior walls. But the interior 
of the stadium will be drastically altered. 
</P>
<P>
After construction of up to 225 luxury boxes at mid-level of the stadium and 
placement of 15,000 club seats, the capacity of the new stadium will be 70,000 
for Raiders games and 85,000 for USC, down from the 92,500 seats in the 
existing stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation of an environmental impact report, expected to take up to a year, 
will be followed by the beginning of reconstruction immediately after the 1991 
Raiders and USC seasons, according to the agreement reached today. Marketing of 
the luxury boxes, on a long-term, lease-licensing arrangement, is to begin even 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 season, both the Raiders and USC will have to find alternate 
playing sites. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports the Raiders may seek an agreement to play in Dodger 
Stadium, while USC may try for Anaheim Stadium.

3 GET MAXIMUM IN JOGGER ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK: FIVE- TO 10-YEAR TERMS ARE HANDED DOWN IN THE CENTRAL PARK 'WILDING' 
CASE.

<P>
Three teen-agers who continued to profess their innocence received maximum 
prison sentences of five to 10 years today for the "wilding" rape and assault 
of a woman jogging in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Give me the max," one of the defiant youths, Yusef Salaam, told Judge Thomas 
Galligan before sentence was passed. "Sooner or later the truth will come out." 
</P>
<P>
Galligan, in turn, denounced the three for showing no remorse, "only defiance." 
On the night the jogger was attacked, he said, "Central Park was turned into a 
torture chamber by mindless marauders seeking a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity of the violence that occurred that night is something no 
rational mind can explain," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the youths were tried as adults because of the seriousness of the 
charges, Galligan had to sentence them as juveniles because they were under 16 
when the jogger was attacked on April 19, 1989. An adult would have faced up to 
25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam and Antron McCray, both 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, were convicted Aug. 
18 of attacking the woman and assaulting two men the same night. They were 
acquitted of attempted murder and a lesser count of sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
The judge denied motions to have the three sentenced in Family Court, asking, 
"Is sexual brutality of a woman something that's acceptable or tolerable 
because it happens at the hands of a 14- or 15-year-old? The answer is 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, William Kunstler, an attorney for Salaam, called the proceeding 
"a legal lynching." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect anything to happen here other than the judge to sign the 
maximum," he told Galligan. "I'm so sure of it I've already filled out appeal 
papers." 
</P>
<P>
The teens were accused of raping and trying to kill the jogger, then 28, during 
her nightly run in Central Park. She lost considerable blood and spent two 
weeks in a coma, a doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
Each defendant spoke briefly before sentence was passed. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam read a rambling, rap-style poem he had composed in jail. During the 
reading, he stopped once to glare at prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet begun to fight," he concluded. "This is only the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
McCray told the judge, "I'm not going to let this stop me. I'm going to make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Santana, who struck the meekest tone of the three, said simply, "Everyone knows 
I'm innocent of the crime. I never did it."
