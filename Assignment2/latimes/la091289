NEW PRICE CLUB, CHAIN'S LARGEST, WILL ONLY SELL TO BUSINESS CLIENTS UNTIL IT 
CAN WIN REZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Price Company, the San Diego-based chain of discount warehouse stores, will 
open its first Price Club store in Los Angeles on Sept. 23. The store, all 
144,000 square feet of it on Tampa Boulevard in Northridge, will be the largest 
Price Club store to date, with parking space for 1,000 cars. But it's not 
likely to be overflowing with autos for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is zoning -- or more precisely, the lack of it. As a prominently 
displayed sign in front declares, the new store will sell merchandise only to 
business members, not to individual customers. Unless you represent one of the 
discount warehouse's business members, you'll be asked to go back home. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the property is zoned only for wholesale and industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
Price Company, which has a chain of 45 Price Clubs offering low-cost 
merchandise to customers who pay a membership fee, says it plans to apply for a 
zoning change so it can sell goods to individual members. But company officials 
concede the zoning change, which must be approved by the city of Los Angeles, 
could take a year or more to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Why open a store that only can sell to some of its customers? Brent Knudsen, 
Price Company's vice president of marketing, says the decision was made to open 
the store without rezoning because businesses account for about 70% of a Price 
Club store's average annual volume of $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel P. Garcia, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; 
Olson, which represents Price Company, said the company's failure to obtain a 
zoning change by the opening date wasn't an oversight, but merely reflects the 
need to prepare the zone-change application properly. "It's just a cautious 
start," said Garcia, who is the former president of the Los Angeles City 
Planning Commission, a five-member committee that oversees zoning issues. He 
adds that he expects the rezoning process to go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Price Company acquired the 19.7-acre site last year as part of its $52-million 
takeover of Alfred M. Lewis, a Riverside-based food wholesaler. The Northridge 
facility was formerly a distribution center, but Knudsen said it is ideal for a 
Price Club because the surrounding area has strong demographics and business 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Given the immense amount of information a company must produce to apply for a 
zoning change, it's not surprising that Price Company hasn't applied for the 
change yet, said David Lessley, a city planner who works on zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
Even if no major snags occur, getting new zoning is a Byzantine process. After 
Price Company compiles the necessary information, such as a detailed map and 
environmental data, it must file its request for a change with the city. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Planning Department committee decides if the store should receive 
environmental clearance, or if it should be required to prepare a full 
environmental impact report, which is often required for controversial 
projects. If, for instance, it's determined that the store would generate a 
huge amount of additional traffic in the area, Price Company might be required 
to submit an environmental impact report, which could take up to a year to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Lessley said it's likely that the Price Club would receive environmental 
clearance if certain steps are taken to alleviate potential problems. For 
instance, many retail developments, such as mini-malls, face opposition because 
they provide too few parking spaces and add to traffic congestion. But Price 
Club's big parking lot could alleviate that worry. 
</P>
<P>
If the company wins environmental clearance, the Planning Department will 
schedule a public hearing. After the hearing, a Planning Department examiner 
will prepare a report that often lists conditions, such as a certain type of 
landscaping, for a zoning change to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The approved zoning request moves to the City Council's Planning and Land Use 
Committee, chaired by Councilman Hal Bernson. Another hearing, this one by 
Bernson's committee, is held and the committee makes its recommendation to the 
full council. The council would then draft a zone-change ordinance, which the 
mayor must sign. Thirty days after the ordinance is published by the city clerk 
in a general-circulation newspaper, the change becomes effective. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the Price Company's lawyer, said it's important to get every step right 
in the zoning maze. But he said the process is also "a pain in the neck."

SYNCOR CALLS BID 'RIDICULOUS;' NEW OFFERS UNLIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syncor International Corp.'s rejection of a $77-million buyout bid last week 
apparently closed the door to a possible change of control at the Chatsworth 
firm in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the $7.57-a-share offer from the Lisle, Ill.-based investment 
banking firm Van Kampen Merritt, Syncor said it was not for sale and denied Van 
Kampen Merritt's claim that it had discussed the possibility of a sale with 
Syncor. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van Kampen Merritt said the offer, which was made on friendly 
terms, expired Thursday. No further offers were anticipated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Kampen Merritt, a subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services, made the offer 
Sept. 1 on behalf of a client identified only as OSW Funding. The investment 
banking firm's spokesman declined to say who owns OSW Funding. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor operates a network of 84 high-tech pharmacy service centers that prepare 
and deliver radioactive pharmaceuticals and other specialty drugs to hospitals, 
medical clinics, doctors' offices and homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer 'Ridiculous' 
</P>
<P>
Syncor President and Chief Executive Officer Gene R. McGrevin said the fact 
that Van Kampen Merritt wouldn't say who was behind the offer and that OSW 
Funding let the offer expire so quickly was "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real offer," McGrevin said. 
</P>
<P>
McGrevin also said Van Kampen Merritt acted with "gross misrepresentation" by 
stating that it had held merger talks with Syncor. Monty Fu, chairman of 
Syncor, had previously discussed with Van Kampen Merritt the possibility of 
selling part of his 7.5% stake in the company, but discussions concerning a 
possible sale of the firm never took place, McGrevin said. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year that ended May 31, Syncor earned $433,000, down 89% from $4 
million in net income in fiscal 1988. Revenue rose 9% to $113.9 million from 
$104.7 million. Its stock currently trades at about $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have criticized Syncor because its financial performance has failed to 
live up to expectations, but last January's appointment of McGrevin, a 
health-care industry veteran, as president and chief executive officer was seen 
as a positive move. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that anybody who has studied the company has seen that with new 
management in place the company is in the midst of an earnings turnaround," 
said Steven B. Gerber, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor provides special radioactive pharmaceuticals that detect and treat a 
variety of illnesses and require special handling because they typically have 
shelf lives of just a few hours. Based on the accelerating growth of the 
so-called "nuclear imaging industry," which will probably produce increasing 
numbers of products that require the special handling Syncor provides, 
prospects for the company are quite good, Gerber said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber predicted Syncor would earn $2.1 million in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber also said ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa firm that owns about 8% of 
Syncor's stock, has contemplated a buyout bid for Syncor. ICN would not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But based on growth prospects for Syncor, Gerber doubted that large 
shareholders would consider an offer below $9 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor's largest shareholder is Compagnie Oris Industrie, a French group that 
owns about 15% of Syncor's stock.

 Diodes Inc., a struggling semiconductor maker in Chatsworth, revamped its 
board of directors at the urging of its biggest stockholder, Microsemi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Four non-management directors -- Dorothy N. Lloyd, Charles A. Benak, Albert F. 
Ottobre and Ted G. Slate -- resigned from the board, and Diodes appointed two 
new outside directors: Harold Harrigan, a partner at the investment firm 
Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., and Michael A. Rosenberg, president of SFE 
Technologies, an electronic components company in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Three directors retained their seats: David M. Lloyd, Diodes' chairman and 
chief executive; Alan B. Lees, Diodes' vice president and general counsel, and 
Maurice L. Muehle, another outside director. 
</P>
<P>
The new five-member board will be elected annually. Previously Diodes had a 
staggered board whereby only two or three directors were elected each year. 
</P>
<P>
Diodes, which lost $2.9 million in its fiscal year that ended April 30, said 
the board structure was suggested by Microsemi, a Santa Ana electronics concern 
that owns 25% of Diodes. 
</P>
<P>
Lees said Microsemi "felt the board would be more effective" in its new format. 
Asked if Microsemi urged the changes because of Diodes' recent performance, 
Lees replied: "I don't think it was the immediate reason," but added that 
"obviously all the shareholders are not too happy with the losses we've 
posted."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: HUNTWAY PARTNERS' ARIZONA REFINERY BEGINS OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based refiner and marketer of liquid asphalt, said 
its new Arizona refinery has begun operations. 
</P>
<P>
The refinery can process up to 8,500 barrels of crude oil daily and is a key 
element in Huntway's growth plans. The refinery, which is between Phoenix and 
Tucson, enables Huntway to sell liquid asphalt to the Arizona market without 
having to transport it from California. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway built the refinery next to the All-American Pipeline, which began 
moving crude oil between California and Texas in 1987.

Newhall Land &amp; Farming completed the sale of 238 single-family lots in its 
Northbridge residential development in Valencia for $43 million to Bramalea 
California, a unit of Trizec Corp. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which covers 87 acres, will add about $23 million to Newhall's 
third-quarter profit and an additional $7 million in coming years as the 
project is completed, Newhall said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said sale proceeds would be used to reduce bank debt that Newhall 
incurred earlier this year to repurchase some of its units. Newhall is a master

VALLEY ROUNDUP: MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS PLUS BEING ADVISED BY KOLL CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage Investments Plus, a real estate investment trust in Woodland Hills, is 
being advised by Koll Co. in Newport Beach, which took over the role from 
Weyerhaeuser Co. 
</P>
<P>
MIP, a publicly held concern that invests in commercial property, was formerly 
advised by Weyerhaeuser's Income Property Division, an arm of the timber 
giant's financial services group, and all of MIP's workers actually were 
employed by Weyerhaeuser. The advisory role meant that Weyerhaeuser helped MIP 
with administration and selecting brokers and lenders, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
However, MIP President Lawrence W. Farmer acknowledged earlier this year that 
Weyerhaeuser was making little money advising MIP. Weyerhaeuser has also been 
refocusing its operations to concentrate on residential lending. 
</P>
<P>
Weyerhaeuser transferred its Income Property Division and its workers to Koll, 
a commercial real estate concern. Koll then set up Koll Realty Advisers to take 
over the group's operations. The group will oversee about $400 million worth of 
loans and investments in commercial property belonging to Weyerhaeuser, MIP and 
Republic Savings Bank, a Woodland Hills-based thrift owned by Weyerhaeuser, 
Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer will now run Koll Realty Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Because no property assets actually changed hands, no cash or other 
compensation was exchanged, he said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: CHEROKEE REPORTS INCOME OF $2.38 MILLION FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cherokee Group, a Sunland apparel concern that was acquired by a private 
investor group in May, reported net income for its fiscal year that ended May 
27 of $2.38 million, down from $12.7 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee, which was bought for $174 million by Green Acquisition Co., which 
included certain members of Cherokee's management, also said its annual sales 
rose 8% to $169.4 million from $156.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed much of the profit decline on costs associated with the 
acquisition, including a one-time, $5.6-million charge related to Cherokee's 
settlement of stock options held by various Cherokee executives and others.

VALLEY EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS LOSES $119,000 IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House of Fabrics, a Sherman Oaks-based chain of fabric and sewing stores, lost 
$119,000 in its fiscal second quarter that ended July 31, contrasted with a 
$454,000 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company's sales rose 13% to $81.3 million from $72 million. But House of 
Fabrics, which operates 644 stores, said the sales growth was not as strong as 
it had hoped in light of the company's increased use of advertising and 
promotions during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, House of Fabrics' profit fell 50%, to 
$1.22 million from $2.46 million. Its six-month sales rose 9% to $160.8 million 
from $147 million.

David Chaffee has been named senior vice president and commercial loan 
development officer at the Bank of San Diego, overseeing all new business and 
expansion of the bank's international banking services and credit functions. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the bank, Chaffee spent 12 years with Bank of America. Most 
recently, he was BofA's vice president and marketing manager for San Diego and 
Imperial county commercial banking. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee, 48, has a strong background in international banking. He served more 
than three years as section head in BofA's Jakarta and Taipei offices in the 
Far East. It was not the first time he lived in Asia, nor was he unfamiliar 
with Asian culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I speak Chinese, and I have a master's degree in Chinese history as well as a 
master's in international management," Chaffee said, adding that in the early 
'70s, he spent a year at the National Taiwan University researching Chinese 
history." 
</P>
<P>
"So, living there was not an unknown for me. . . . Bank of America wanted that 
from their section head," he said. Chaffee worked with a number of kinds of 
businesses, including plastics, textiles, petrochemical and electronics 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee's banking career began 15 years ago with Union Planters National Bank 
in Tennessee. His education includes a undergraduate degree from Occidental 
College. He is an active member on San Diego's World Affairs Council, and he 
has served on the board of COMBO, a local arts fund-raising group. CAROLINE

JACK SMITH: WAR READER RECALLS THE PARTING SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of us must feel, in these days of changing mores and high technology, that 
we were "Born Thirty Years Too Soon," which was the title of a popular 
newspaper cartoon of the 1920s and early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Now readers R. Loring of Calabasas and Kenneth S. Biely of Santa Maria have 
sent me a clipping from The Times that makes me feel that I was born 40 years 
too soon for my service in the Marine Corps in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It reports that Gen. A. M. Gray, commandant of the corps, has ordered all 
commissioned officers to read from three to six books a year, and for noncoms 
to read from two to four. Gen. Gray explains that "Marines fight better when 
they fight smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Gen. Gray urges his men to read books about war -- thus "War and 
Peace," "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Red Badge of Courage" are on 
his list, but not Shakespeare, James Joyce or Dickens. He also recommends 
biographies of Patton, Eisenhower and MacArthur, and books on strategy by Mao, 
Thucydides and Von Clausewitz. 
</P>
<P>
Such reading, the commandant believes, will provide vicarious combat 
experience. "You take from what you learn about battles at Gettysburg, Pusan or 
Tet and apply it at crucial moments." 
</P>
<P>
(Biely points out that Tet is not a place, but the North Vietnamese name for 
the lunar new year.) 
</P>
<P>
I wish the commandant in my time had been so literary minded. When I joined the 
corps I had already read "War and Peace," "All Quiet on the Western Front" and 
"The Red Badge of Courage." 
</P>
<P>
I question, though, that any of them prepared me for combat. "War and Peace" 
did deal with strategy on a grand scale, but I doubt that I was ever in a 
position to exploit that knowledge, being only a staff sergeant; "All Quiet" 
was one of the most powerful anti-war books I have ever read, and "The Red 
Badge of Courage," as I remember it, was about a soldier who had to face up to 
his cowardice. (That might have been useful.) 
</P>
<P>
I can't help thinking that promotion might have come faster for me if our 
commandant had admired Marines who read. I was always lugging a book around in 
my fatigues -- the pockets were just big enough for one of those wonderful 
paperbacks that were published for the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
When we left Pearl Harbor for Iwo Jima, I took half a dozen books to read on 
the transport. One of them, I remember, was a paperback edition of Will 
Durant's "Caesar and Christ," volume three in his "Story of Civilization." That 
should have made me some points with Gen. Gray, had he been in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the books I took with me was "You Can't Go Home Again" by Thomas 
Wolfe. On the transport we slept in tiers of bunks five high. I had wisely 
chosen the top bunk, to be near a light, so I could read at night. The bunk 
below me was occupied by an 18-year-old boy who hadn't had much education, but 
who wanted to learn. He asked if I could lend him a book. I had a feeling that 
he had never owned one. 
</P>
<P>
I lent him "You Can't Go Home Again." He laughed when he read the title. He 
made some joke about its being inappropriate (though that wasn't his word) for 
a Marine about to go into battle. I agreed with him; but I'm not superstitious, 
and I didn't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
He worked hard at the book. He read some of it every night, and when we reached 
our target he had read it almost all the way through. Of course he didn't take 
it ashore. That would have been inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
I saw him on D plus 30 -- the day we were to embark for our return to Maui. The 
island had been declared secure. All of us felt lucky to be alive. We were 
leaving almost 7,000 dead on the island. Before we boarded the ship, my friend 
said he was going to make one last sortie -- there were still plenty of 
Japanese survivors around -- in search of a Samurai sword. He wanted a trophy. 
I told him it was foolishly dangerous, but he was determined. 
</P>
<P>
I never saw him again, and I heard that he had been shot through the head.

NONSURGICAL ALTERNATIVE TO FACE LIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why get a face lift to look younger, reasoned Nana Weinberg, when simple 
implants to plump up the cheeks might do the job for now. So the 48-year-old 
Los Angeles architect opted for a new and controversial anti-aging procedure 
called submalar augmentation. 
</P>
<P>
Offered by a growing number of physicians, cheek implants are quicker and 
cheaper than traditional face lifts. The small, teardrop-shaped silastic 
implants are inserted through the mouth during a simple 45-minute office 
procedure, and the bandages are removed within three days. A face lift 
operation, on the other hand, can take hours, and swelling can persist for a 
week or more afterwards. Fees for California face lifts that can cost as much 
as $4,200 are three times the implant fees. 
</P>
<P>
The implants work by restoring the facial fullness that wanes with age as 
underlying fat in the cheekbone area shrinks, says Dr. William A. Binder, a Los 
Angeles facial, plastic and reconstructive surgeon who just published a report 
of the new procedure in the Archives of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck 
Surgery. The fat loss usually becomes evident after age 35. "That's the time," 
says the plastic surgeon, "when patients begin complaining, 'I look old, 
depressed and sad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Binder sees the implant procedure as an alternative to face lifts for younger 
patients between the ages of 35 and 50 and as an adjunct for older patients. 
Weinberg, for instance, followed up the implant with a face lift a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
But some of Binder's colleagues strongly disagree that the implants can ever 
take the place of traditional face lifts. "I don't believe it's an alternative 
at all to a face lift because they only fill out the middle of the face," says 
Dr. Edward O. Terino, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon who has inserted implants 
similar to those used by Binder for more than a decade. "But it can be a 
valuable adjunct to face lift." 
</P>
<P>
Whether implants are adjuncts or alternatives, there can be problems. In 
Binder's study, 5 of his 78 patients ended up with asymmetrical implants that 
required adjustment. Two patients got abscesses that were resolved by drainage 
and antibiotics; three had reduced lip movement that returned to normal within 
a month; and some had numbness of the upper lip, but sensation returned within 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the implants are inserted without a hitch, they can't always solve 
the "great expectation" problem. Explains Binder with a sigh: "Everyone wants 
to look like Kim Basinger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drinking to Excess 
</P>
<P>
Downing a couple of alcoholic drinks a day might help prevent heart disease, 
several studies suggest. But if you exceed two drinks, you may risk a double 
whammy disadvantage. The excess alcohol is likely to increase blood pressure 
and decrease your absorption of dietary calcium that may help lower pressure. 
That's the conclusion of a study released today and published in this month's 
Circulation, an American Heart Assn. journal. 
</P>
<P>
"For the average person, bad things start happening physiologically at more 
than two drinks a day," says Dr. Michael H. Criqui, professor of medicine and 
professor of community and family medicine at the University of California San 
Diego School of Medicine. He studied the effects of alcohol in more than 7,000 
men, discovering that higher calcium consumption is associated with lower blood 
pressures among nondrinkers and light drinkers. But those who drank two or more 
drinks per day did not seem to enjoy the blood pressure-lowering effects of 
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Another expert, Dr. Arthur Klatsky, chief of cardiology at Kaiser Permanente, 
Oakland, sees the new study as an extension of some of his own cardiac 
research. "We've done two different studies showing that those who drink three 
or more drinks a day are more likely to have high blood pressure." And several 
studies suggest that 1000 milligrams of calcium a day -- about that found in 
three glasses of milk -- can help lower blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Criqui's advice: Don't exceed two drinks of beer, wine or mixed liquor daily. 
And don't consider two drinks a requirement. The study isn't meant to encourage 
drinking, he says, nor to persuade those drinking less than two per day to hike 
intake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice to Parents 
</P>
<P>
For most parents, the situation is familiar. You're worried about your child's 
vocabulary, attention span or some other developmental milestones, but you 
wonder if it's important enough to mention to the pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
Speak up, suggest Vanderbilt University researchers who found parents anxious 
about their child's development usually have valid concerns, even if they lack 
medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers asked 100 families seeking pediatric care to describe concerns 
about their children's development while their offspring took a developmental 
screening test. Eighty percent of the children who failed the screening tests 
had parents who expressed concerns about their development in the same areas. 
In comparison, 94% of the kids who passed the screening had parents without 
developmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
This study proves parents don't need to rely on formal knowledge to assess 
development, explains William MacLean, a pediatric psychologist and one of the 
authors of the study just published in the American Journal of Diseases of 
Children. What was their most frequently used measuring stick? Comparisons with 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents should not be afraid to bring up their concerns with pediatricians," 
says MacLean, noting that several studies have found parents reluctant to 
discuss "nonmedical" issues with their children's doctors, fearing they are not 
correct or that they will take too much of the busy doctor's time. 
</P>
<P>
"Most parents are good observers, even if they are not medically 
sophisticated," adds Dr. Diane Henderson, a pediatrician and developmental 
specialist at Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles. "I've been trying to teach 
residents the importance of listening to parental concerns for years. Now I 
have a study to back me up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trauma Folklore 
</P>
<P>
It's well-known folklore among emergency room doctors: when the moon is full, 
the waiting room will overflow with victims of trauma and violence. Not so, 
find three Pittsburgh doctors who reviewed the records of nearly 1,500 trauma 
victims admitted to Allegheny General Hospital during a calendar year. They 
discovered, in fact, admissions were slightly higher on waning moon days (a 
mean of 3.98 patients a day) than on full moon days (3.58 patients per day). 
Fewer helicopter transfers of trauma patients occurred on full moon days, too, 
found the researchers, who published their report recently in the Annals of 
Emergency Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The full moon may even have a protective effect against violence, suggest the 
researchers. A brighter night sky, for instance, might deter crime by better 
illumination of roadways. "That's speculation of course," says co-author Dr. 
Wendy Coates.

ART BUCHWALD: FLAG-BURNING ISSUE: PLAYING WITH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress has been hard at work trying to come up with a constitutional 
amendment that makes it illegal to burn the American flag. It is a hot topic 
for legislation because it could be the only issue in the coming elections. 
This is particularly true since there has been no movement in Congress on any 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign managers are now hard at work thinking of ways to make their 
candidate's opponents look like flag abusers. The obvious television commercial 
is a burning flag in the street with a voice-over saying, "Walt Wallemeer 
couldn't care less that someone set fire to your flag. It's no surprise since 
flag-burning is something he has practiced since he got into politics." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake about it. The campaign is going to get dirty and Old Glory is 
going to be the issue. 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem with all this. There has been no reported flag-burning 
incident in the United States for two years. 
</P>
<P>
When Jackal, who is running Cumbersome's campaign, went to the TV station to 
buy a piece of flag-burning film for his commercial, he was informed no new 
footage existed. 
</P>
<P>
Rothermere, the head of the station, told him, "Nobody seems to be burning 
flags these days. They are shooting people, sticking them up, throwing rocks at 
each other, and setting fire to cars -- but not to the flag. Our field 
producers have assured demonstrators that if they burn the flag we'll guarantee 
that their demonstration will get on the evening news, but we have yet to find 
anyone who will go to the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Jackal said, "I can't believe it. How can we pass a constitutional amendment 
against desecrating the flag when no one will do it?" 
</P>
<P>
"You have a problem," the station manager admitted. "We have some footage of 
flag-burning from the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. But the color is faded 
and it looks dated." 
</P>
<P>
Jackal agreed. "That wouldn't work because we want to show that flag-burning is 
a clear and present danger." 
</P>
<P>
"We have shots of people into dope and arson and white-collar crime coming out 
of our ears. We even have groups hanging the vice president in effigy. We have 
pictures of street gangs shooting automatic submachine guns, but for some 
reason we have no flag abusers on tape. This is a real surprise because you 
hear nothing but speeches from politicians on flag-burning." 
</P>
<P>
Jackal said, "We had the same problem during the Communist witch hunts. 
Everyone was against Communists but we didn't have any. Do you know what we 
did? We invented them. We had the entire country believing there was a 
Communist in every garage. We can do the same with the flag-burners. If there 
aren't any, we'll invent them." 
</P>
<P>
"Does this mean you will have phony flag-torchers in your commercials?" 
</P>
<P>
"If that is the only way to get a constitutional amendment, then it must be 
done. Maybe they aren't burning the American flag today -- but tomorrow they 
will, and then we'll have the law on the books to protect us." 
</P>

Look for new young TV stars to meet up with veteran performers on Sunday's Emmy 
Awards telecast, Fox Broadcasting said Monday. Fox, which will televise the 
ceremonies, listed Johnny Depp, Kirk Cameron, Fred Savage, Tracy Ullman, 
Arsenio Hall and Jamie Lee Curtis as participants along with Bob Hope, Angela 
Lansbury, Robert Wagner, Robert Duvall and Marlo Thomas. There will be no 
production numbers on the show, but there will be clips of "unlikely duos," 
plus a five-minute tribute to Lucille Ball, who will posthumously receive the 
TV academy's Board of Governors Award. Overall, the theme of this year's 41st 
annual Emmy Awards is to celebrate 50 years of television. ALEENE MacMINN

The Federal Communications Commission has turned down a petition from the 
National Hispanic Media Coalition to deny the license renewal for KCET Channel 
28, it was learned Monday. The coalition had sought the denial, charging that 
the public broadcasting station discriminated against Latinos in employment and 
did not have an adequate plan to hire minorities in upper-level positions. The 
FCC, in a letter to the coalition, stated that it believes KCET has generally 
complied with the commission's rules in minority hiring. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
WITHOUT A WORD, MUSEUM WILL MIX MUSIC AND FILM

If imitation is one of the choicer modes of flattery, then the San Diego 
Symphony should feel duly flattered. The popularity of its 2-year-old 
"Nickelodeon" series, which has brought a number of classic silent films to 
life with period orchestral accompaniment, has encouraged the La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art to experiment with a similar format. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Sherwood Auditorium, the museum will present Buster Keaton's 
1926 silent film, "The General," accompanied by the San Diego Cine-phonic 
theater orchestra under the baton of Eric Beheim. "Cops," a shorter film also 
by Keaton, will accompany "The General." If this fare is a hit with the La 
Jolla cinema audience -- the museum sponsors about 70 evenings of films every 
year -- the museum's resident film curator, Gregory Kahn, has two more silent 
films waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've attended all the 'Nickelodeon' performances at Symphony Hall," Kahn said. 
"I think the advantage of the museum's presentation is that the setting is more 
intimate. The audience will actually be able to see the players, and the size 
of orchestra is more authentic to what audiences would have found in San Diego 
theaters such as the Spreckels and the Fox in the 1920s." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn explained that the museum decided to place the musicians on stage just to 
the right of the screen, rather than below the screen in a pit. Sherwood 
Auditorium does not have a pit, of course, but, for some chamber opera 
performances given there, the front rows of audience seating have been removed 
to accommodate such placement. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kahn, "The General" is one of the best films of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
"Every decade, 'Sight and Sound,' the British film industry quarterly, runs a 
list of the 10 best films," Kahn said. " 'The General' is consistently on that 
list. Made at the apex of Keaton's film career, 'The General' is not only his 
most successful film, but the one done on the biggest budget. It was shot on 
location (rather than on studio lots), and they blew up real railway bridges 
when the story called for it. Also, Keaton did all of his own stunt work." 
</P>
<P>
Beheim is a local musician who plays in the pit for touring musicals and has 
conducted the Seaport Village Band on occasion. A few years ago, he started 
playing silent films with friends as an amusement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've collected silent films since I was a college student in the 1960s," 
Beheim said, "and, in 1981, I acquired a private collection of some 1,800 
silent film accompaniments." 
</P>
<P>
Although Beheim said there is no extant musical score to "The General," he owns 
an authentic orchestra cue sheet sent out by the studio to accompany the film. 
</P>
<P>
"The cue sheet gives indications such as 'mood music number 5' or 'mysterioso 
number 3.' Some of the more specific musical indications I've changed, however. 
For example, a 1920s jazz piece 'Alabama Bound' would not be recognized or have 
any meaning to an audience today. And, especially since it's not a Civil 
War-era song, I've replaced it with period songs such as 'Marching Through 
Georgia,' 'Dixie' and 'Rally 'Round the Flag'." 
</P>
<P>
Beheim's 12-piece orchestra includes five strings and six winds, as well as a 
drummer and sound-effects man. The latter is responsible for musical noises 
such as train whistles, cannon shots and train wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all done live," Beheim said. "We don't use any recorded sound effects." 
</P>
<P>
Wish you were here: For the La Jolla Symphony's season-opening concert Sept. 
23, music director Thomas Nee had lined up noted classical guitarists Pepe and 
Celin Romero. Last week, the brothers canceled their appearance because of a 
scheduling conflict. While guitarists Randy Pile and Alex Dunn, both proteges 
of Pepe Romero, will still perform on the all-Rodrigo program, two of the 
larger Rodrigo concertos had to be dropped from the program. In place of 
"Concierto Para una Fiesta" and "Concierto Andaluz," Nee's orchestra will play 
one of the few Rodrigo works without guitars, the "Suite Soleriana." 
</P>
<P>
The king of instruments: The University of San Diego will dedicate a new pipe 
organ at 8 p.m. Friday in Founders Chapel. Organist Robert Thompson will play 
the dedicatory recital on the single keyboard, mechanical-action instrument 
constructed by Missouri organ builder Martin Ott. The new instrument, placed in 
the front of the chapel, will complement the larger pipe organ in the chapel's 
rear gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's program will include two works commissioned for the event, 
Variations on "Sine Nomine" by Chicago composer Richard Proulx and "Trompe 
l'Orielle" by UC San Diego composer Randall Giles. Because the Giles piece 
requires both of the chapel's organs, USD music director Father Nicolas Reveles 
will assist Thompson. Accompanied by the USD String Octet, Reveles will perform 
Handel's Organ Concerto in B-flat, Op. 4, No. 6. Thompson is director of music 
at All Souls' Episcopal Church, Point Loma, and is a former faculty member of 
St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Theme and variations: The downtown San Diego Public Library will open its fall 
chamber music series tonight with a recital by pianist Edith Orloff. . . . 
Choral singers have one last chance to audition for the upcoming season of the 
La Jolla Symphony Chorus. Director David Chase will be taking his charges on a 
two-week tour of Poland and the Soviet Union next spring; interested singers 
should contact Peter Jorgensen at 481-1582 this week to schedule an audition. . 
. . St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral will inaugurate a series of noon-hour 
recitals Wednesday with a performance by the UC San Diego Woodwind Quintet.

Does cable TV need a Cowboy Television Network? Country music star Willie 
Nelson apparently thinks so, and has paid $1 million-plus to Norman Lear's Act 
III Entertainment to corral more than 4,000 vintage country music television 
shows featuring the likes of Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton, Flatt and Scruggs 
and Marty Robbins. Nelson hopes to start the channel next year, broadcasting 
the historic shows along with music videos, movies and specials. The operation 
would be based near his Austin, Tex., home. ALEENE MacMINN

Cable TV also looks alluring to former Delaware Gov. Pierre (Pete) du Pont IV, 
an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican presidential nomination last year. 
He has a one-hour pilot for a monthly program, "Panoply: A Consumer's Guide to 
the Information Age," coming up Sept. 24 on CNBC, the NBC-owned business and 
consumer cable network. Du Pont will introduce the program and participate on a 
panel that will include Harvard law professor Arthur Miller, along with print 
and electronic journalists. ALEENE MacMINN

A possible strike looms by New York City Opera orchestra members if they reject 
management's final offer at a meeting tonight. Although subsidiary issues 
exist, the two main stumbling blocks to a settlement are guaranteed work weeks 
and salary issues. Should a strike be called, picket lines will be set up for 
the current "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" at Lincoln Center. The union's refusal to 
give a no-strike guarantee for this season has already caused the company to 
cancel plans for a new production of Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron." The 
orchestra members have been performing under an expired contract. ALEENE

More than $240,000 was raised for AIDS research, education and patient care 
Sunday at an Art Against AIDS/Los Angeles auction held at Butterfield &amp; 
Butterfield. The auction brings the total raised by the two-year Art Against 
AIDS campaign -- which has included events in Los Angeles, New York and San 
Francisco -- to nearly $5 million. "We were absolutely delighted," Sally 
Morrison, director of development for the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research, said Monday. She noted that proceeds from the auction will be split 
equally between AmFAR and AIDS Project Los Angeles. The top price at the 
auction, which included works by Richard Diebenkorn, Laddie John Dill, Larry 
Bell and Carlos Almaraz, was generated by a David Hockney lithograph, "Walking 
Past Two Chairs," which went for $65,000. ALEENE MacMINN

BOB COOPER TAKES VICTORY SOLO LAP

It was a big night for Bob Cooper, and he made the most of it. Honored by the 
Los Angeles Jazz Society with its Annual Tribute Award, he was the featured 
soloist at the group's seventh annual awards concert and dinner Sunday at the 
Hyatt Regency Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Cooper said most of what he had to say via the expressive medium of 
his robust tenor saxophone. Working with the sterling rhythm section of Ross 
Tompkins on piano, John Leitham on bass and Larance Marable on drums, he 
charged through a group of familiar standards, peaking with a thoughtful but 
swinging take on the less familiar "Nobody Else But Me." 
</P>
<P>
When a scheduling problem forced Tompkins to depart, his role was filled by the 
gifted young Eric Reed, a pianist who clearly has the potential to do great 
things. Trumpeter Conte Candoli also joined the ensemble for a vigorous be-bop 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wiggins, a perennial at the society's programs, followed with a brisk 
sail through the challenging chords of "Cherokee," highlighted by Ralph 
Penland's beautifully modulated drum solo. Bassist Red Callender laid down a 
sturdy foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The revolving door of musicians continued to turn, with Monty Budwig replacing 
Callender as guitarist John Collins joined Wiggins and Penland for a somewhat 
bland but mellow interpretation of "Like Someone in Love." The pinnacle of the 
evening, however, was reached with the arrival of trumpeter Harry (Sweets) 
Edison. Wasting no time applying his trademark riffs to the proceedings, he 
played only one piece, "Sunday," but it was more than enough to certify his 
still-remarkable jazz powers. 
</P>
<P>
The long program wound toward a close with a set of vigorous improvisations by 
the always-at-their-best vocal duo of Don and Alicia Cunningham. Then, finally, 
Reed came back on stage to accompany guitarist Steve Gregory, who received the 
Society's Shelly Manne Memorial New Talent Award. 
</P>
<P>
Other honorees included saxophonist Vi Redd (Lifetime Achievement Award), 
pianist Horace Silver (Composer/Arranger Award) and Joel Leach, the society's 
educator of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moments before the great beast struck, Mark Felix could see a stupendous spout 
rising above the waves, a 50-foot geyser on the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
It was, the 20-year sailing veteran and former whale-watching guide recalled, 
the largest whale of any kind he had seen in his life. 
</P>
<P>
And it was about to ram a hole in the 57-foot yacht with Felix at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked more like a tornado than a water spout," he said. "It was at least 
50 feet high, which means the whale was probably twice that big. It was a whale 
of a whale. It looked like Moby Dick to me." 
</P>
<P>
The huge finback whale suddenly rammed the wooden Chriscraft yacht, The Lady 
Ruth, punching a jagged crack in its bow. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact was like hitting an immense rock with some rubber coating around 
it," recalled Charles Gray, 30, one of the crewmen. "It stopped the boat dead 
in its tracks. It even lifted it out of the water." 
</P>
<P>
Within 45 minutes, the crew had abandoned the sinking vessel and piled into a 
rubber life raft for what was to be a harrowing afternoon adrift at sea. 
</P>
<P>
After seven hours scanning the horizon for ships and yelling at the whales who 
had stuck around, the crew was rescued by an 80-foot Coast Guard cutter on 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Distraction at First 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, all three were back home in San Diego, trying to explain what 
experts have termed as one of the rarest incidents to occur at sea -- an 
unprovoked attack by whales. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, 39, was one of three crewmen hired to deliver the 25-year-old yacht from 
San Diego to Discovery Bay in the Sacramento River Delta when the three came 
upon a pod of finback whales Saturday, heading in the same direction 40 miles 
off the coast of Monterey. Over several hours they saw 25 to 30 finback whales, 
which can grow to 70 feet long and weigh more than 50 tons. 
</P>
<P>
At first the whales, traveling in family groups of three or four, were little 
more than a distraction. Until the attack, the whales came no closer than half 
a mile. When fellow crewman Charles Gray handed over the yacht's controls to 
Felix about noon, he even joked about the presence of the big sea mammals. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey Mark, don't hit any whales now," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, one of the whales hit them. 
</P>
<P>
William Reich, the acting skipper of the boat, said that, a moment before the 
whale hit, Felix had commented that he saw a whale's footprint, the image left 
behind on the surface after the mammal sounds, or dives. 
</P>
<P>
"And then 'Boom!' It sounded like a cannon went off," said the 44-year-old 
Reich, a Coast Guard-licensed merchant marine master. "The whale came up right 
into the bottom of the boat. He knocked Mark right out of his chair." 
</P>
<P>
Felix said that "just before the whale hit, I saw the huge spout and another 
smaller spout. It could have been a mother who rammed us because we got too 
close to her calf." 
</P>
<P>
Gray echoed the theory. "They had followed us for quite some time. It's kind of 
boring out there, so they probably had this mild curiosity. But, never in a 
million years, would I have thought they would ram us." 
</P>
<P>
Felix added: "I've been so close to whales before you could smell their breath. 
And they have hellacious breath. I mean, whales can pick you up with their 
sonar miles away. They'll spook in a second if you get too close. A whale 
doesn't make contact with you at sea by accident." 
</P>
<P>
Two whale experts Monday offered varying explanations for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Largest of Whales 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare," said Dr. Graham Worthy, a research biologist at the 
University of California, Santa Cruz. "But whales have been known to attack 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Before federal laws prohibited onlookers from getting so close, gray whales had 
been known to ram or topple small boats that wandered too near in Scammon's 
Lagoon in Baja California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their mating instincts are pretty strong," Worthy said. "If anything came 
between a mother and her calf, she'd feel threatened and she'd probably attack. 
</P>
<P>
"But this sinking sounds to me a more severe result than expected. It could 
have been a lucky hit by the whale." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tom Dohl, another research biologist at the UC Santa Cruz, said finback 
whales can weigh more than 50 tons and are the second-largest whale. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its weight and size, he rejected the idea that a whale would launch an 
unprovoked attack on a boat. "I even reject the phrase 'whale attack,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The probability is that this guy drove his boat into the whale, not vice 
versa," he said. Dan Byrne of the Cousteau Society in Los Angeles said the 
boat's wooden construction may have sent confusing signals to the whale, 
provoking the attack. 
</P>
<P>
He noted at least four whale attacks that have taken place within a 500-mile 
radius of the Galapagos Islands in the South Pacific within the past 20 years, 
including an incident last month in which a Florida couple remained adrift for 
88 days after being attacked by a pod of whales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooden Hulls the Key? 
</P>
<P>
Each of the incidents had one thing in common, he said. The downed boats were 
all made of wood, rather than fiberglass or some other seaworthy material. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that they produced an echo to the whale's sonar that sent back a 
threatening signal," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, the crewmen of the Lady Ruth feel lucky to have survived. 
</P>
<P>
"See these, they're 'We're-just-happy-to-be-alive-brewskis,' " said Felix as he 
and Gray sat on the back porch of his Linda Vista home about noon Monday, 
drinking beer. "We don't normally drink this early in the day." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gray and Felix, a seasoned sailor who had delivered several boats up and 
down the West Coast, were hired by Reich, who had contracted with the boat's 
owner to deliver the aging yacht. 
</P>
<P>
The three left Harbor Island about 6 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They spotted the whales Saturday morning and were at first intrigued by their 
presence. After rounding Point Conception in the morning in high seas, they 
thought the worst of the trip was over. 
</P>
<P>
Then disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
While Reich radioed for help, both Felix and Gray went below deck, throwing 
possessions out of the way in order to reach the battered bow. 
</P>
<P>
For 45 minutes, they used a pocket knife to cut shards of a blanket to plug the 
leak, praying aloud that someone would hear their radio call. The crack in the 
hull was wide enough to put a fist through. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10-foot waves were throwing them about the cabin, knocking the radio 
out for several minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe it was happening," Gray said. "It was like a nightmare." 
Finally Reich, the Lady Ruth's acting skipper, gave the order to abandon ship. 
Reich couldn't be reached Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alone Out There' 
</P>
<P>
The three inflated the six-man emergency raft, grabbing several flares, a pair 
of binoculars, a sextant and several other belongings. As they bobbed in their 
raft under a darkening afternoon sky, the men watched the Lady Ruth go under. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird to see the ship go down," Gray said. "All of a sudden we were 
alone out there. And it's a mighty big ocean." 
</P>
<P>
At first, they were too angry to panic, yelling obscenities at the whales who 
had apparently stuck around to the watch the action. "We yelled things you 
can't print," Gray said, "stuff like, 'Nuke the whales!' and all that. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought they had come back to finish us off." 
</P>
<P>
After two passing ships failed to notice their flares, the crew became more 
worried. Although they had provisions for two weeks, they dreaded the cold 
night ahead. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they were in sight of land, they knew that the rough waves could 
bash their raft on the rocky coast if they got too close. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after seven hours in the white-crested waves, the three were picked up 
by a Coast Guard cutter, the Point Winslow, on routine coastal patrol from 
Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, there they were," Gray said. "When they pulled us on board, 
the waves were so high that, one minute the raft was level with the deck, and 
the next you couldn't reach the bottom rung of the ladder." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, a plumber by trade, said the trip was his first boat delivery job. And 
probably his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid to even go near the bathtub right now," he said. "I was in a Hobie 
Cat accident on Mission Bay the other day in which my friend was seriously 
hurt. This is my second scrape in a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I just want to stay as far away from the water as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Reich, who has been in the seafaring business for 22 years, was treated Monday 
for several scrapes suffered in the mishap. In 10 days, he said, he'll be part 
of a crew taking an 85-foot schooner to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this is what I do," he said. "I've been riding these horses over 20 
years. I gotta go. My motto is, 'Sail 'em till they drop.' "

China is engulfed in a "class struggle" over whether socialism can survive 
there, an official commentary declared in a harsh attack on reformers. Domestic 
"class enemies" allied with "international reactionary forces of the capitalist 
class" are seeking to overthrow communism in China, the Guang-ming Daily 
commentary said. The article charged that many of the reforms advocated in the 
last few years by former General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and his advisers are 
actually aimed at restoring capitalism. One Chinese intellectual predicted that 
the article signals preparations for escalating purges of reformist Communist 
Party members.

South African police, responding to a wave of international and domestic

applies to plastic quirts and that other crowd-dispersal methods will be 
continued, including tear gas, birdshot and batons. An official statement said 
police had regarded quirts as less harmful than batons but that their use is 
being suspended because of "negative public reaction, locally and 
internationally."

Northern sections of the West and Midwest got a taste of winter as light snow 
fell across higher elevations of the eastern Rockies in Colorado, including up 
to half an inch in Woodland Park, Colo. Snow also fell in Minot, N.D. 
Low-temperature records were broken or tied in nine cities. Frost or freeze 
advisories were issued for much of the Dakotas and Nebraska. In Northern and 
Eastern Texas, thunderstorms dumped 2 3/4 inches of rain north of Abilene in 
just 90 minutes. Abilene itself reported 3.14 inches of rain while Dallas 
received 1.3 inches. The storms produced gusts up to 35 m.p.h. in Waco and 
winds that tore off tree limbs in Carlsbad, Tex. Hail fell in Temple and 
Jefferson County, Okla. New record low temperature readings included the 
26-degree reading in Glasgow, Mont., 1 degree lower than the record for the 
date set in 1955, and 27 degrees in Casper, Wyo., where the old mark of 33 
degrees was set in 1974.

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was reelected chairman of his party, the 
Christian Democratic Union, but with a record number of votes against him. More 
than three-quarters of the delegates at the party congress in Bremen voted for 
Kohl to stay on as party leader for the next two years and take them into the 
1990 general election. But a record 147 of the 738 delegates present on the 
opening day of the congress voted against the chancellor, who was the only 
candidate. The party has suffered setbacks in local and European elections in 
the past year. Public disputes between liberals and conservatives within the 
party have also damaged its standing.

Protection Agency that Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver had been 
operated unsafely. The ad featured a letter signed by Donald R. Beall, Rockwell 
chairman and chief executive, and Sam F. Iacobellis, executive vice president 
in charge of Rocky Flats operations. The letter repeated statements made by the 
two men last week to Rocky Flats employees that there is no evidence to support 
the allegations. Rockwell operates Rocky Flats under contract to the U.S. 
Energy Department. The plant manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons.

Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means 
Committee, presented an alternative capital gains tax plan. Dorgan told a news 
conference that his proposal would target most capital gains tax reductions to 
families earning less than $200,000 a year and would phase them out to 
households earning higher incomes. Capital gains are paid on profits from the 
sale of stock and other assets. The plan appeared to counter a proposal by Rep. 
Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) that would institute a 30% exclusion for capital gains 
across the board.

BYRD OFFERS $10-BILLION ANTI-DRUG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democratic chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee called for an 
across-the-board cut in federal spending to finance a $10-billion package of 
anti-drug funding -- some $2 billion more than the $7.9 billion proposed by 
President Bush. The sweeping proposal by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), which 
could face a Senate vote as early as today, would devote substantially more 
money to drug education and treatment programs than the Bush Administration 
package without undermining its law enforcement initiatives. The Byrd plan 
marks the first comprehensive Democratic alternative to the Administration 
proposal. The plan, endorsed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. 
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and other key Democrats, would reduce spending on all 
discretionary programs next year by .58%.

Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), a patient at the Betty Ford Center where he 
is undergoing treatment for alcoholism, is organizing a $1,000-per-plate 
political fund-raising dinner that will avoid all alcoholic beverages. Greene, 
who checked himself into the Rancho Mirage hospital last month, issued the 
invitation in a letter to Sacramento lobbyists. Indicating that he is close to 
completing the treatment program and plans to attend the fund-raiser at a 
Manhattan Beach hotel on Sept. 22, the veteran lawmaker told the lobbyists, 
"There will be plenty of liquids of all types, but there will be no alcohol 
served with dinner." A predinner reception, however, "will be open to anyone's 
preference," he said. "As a footnote, I am going to use a portion of the funds 
from this dinner to establish a recovery program in my Senate district, where 
it is sorely needed and so much can be accomplished through such a program."

Workers in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan ended a weeklong strike protesting 
direct Kremlin control of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Leaders 
of the Azerbaijan People's Front, a nationalist group that called the strike 
more than a week ago, said that most of their political demands were met. The 
People's Front will be officially recognized and allowed to speak at a special 
session of the republic's legislature on Friday, a spokesman said in a call to 
Moscow from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim republic, 
is seeking to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inhabited mainly by 
Armenians. To calm ethnic tensions, Moscow took direct control of the territory 
last winter.

PROTECTING THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Desert Dilemma" (Aug. 27) conveys the impression that 
proponents of the California Desert Protection Act have not sought compromise 
to help it pass. In fact, there have been a number of significant changes made 
in the most recent introduction of the bill, and we have been very clearly 
willing to address specific concerns. There haven't been more changes simply 
because it takes two to make a compromise, and there are few specific conflicts 
to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's opponents have consistently taken an anti-park and wilderness 
position. They want to retain their privilege to continue past destructive 
practices without change. They consider land management that stresses resource 
protection and development for public recreation and interpretation as an 
infringement of that right. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of evident agreement also results from there really being few specific 
conflicts in the bill that require compromise. It was drawn so as to avoid 
unnecessary problems with existing uses, and it has little impact on current 
mining, recreation, and other consumptive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we are uniformly convinced that there is an increased need for 
National Park Service management in the California desert. The NPS mission to 
preserve and interpret for the enjoyment of future generations differs 
fundamentally from the Bureau of Land Management's mandate for multiple-use 
management. 
</P>
<P>
The desert requires large areas for effective ecosystem protection and 
interpretation, and it is difficult to find such expanses in pristine condition 
for future parks. Instead, it requires the vision to see the potential of such 
areas, and the patience to pursue management practices to restore them to their 
intrinsic glory. The East Mojave is such a rough nugget, and despite its few 
scars it is a treasure trove of natural and scenic wonders. It has well-defined 
and manageable boundaries. It is a natural find for the management skills of 
the Park Service, and an essential part of the land use mix envisioned for the 
California desert.

Your editorial repeats several statements from the testimony of Rep. Richard 
Lehman (D-Fresno) at the recent House subcommittee hearing on the California 
Desert Protection Act about the creation of the proposed Mojave National Park. 
These statements are likely to leave an incorrect impression of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman states that the area of the proposed park "is crisscrossed by seven 
transmission lines, gas corridors, two interstate highways and railroads." In 
fact, there are only three power transmission corridors and two gas pipelines 
within the boundary of the proposed park. Numerous existing national parks are 
entered and crossed by public power and gas lines, an example being the power 
transmission lines of Montana Power Co. in Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Two interstate highways, I-15 and I-40, border the proposed park on the south 
and north, but do not cross it except where I-15 crosses a narrow neck 
separating Clark Mountain from the rest of the proposed park. By contrast, 
major highways enter and cross many parks in the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman states: "The land (of the proposed park) is checkerboarded with 
private property." In fact, private lands in the proposed park comprise only 
about 10% of its total area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Mojave National Park is a centerpiece of the desert protection 
bill. As the BLM (which presently administers the area of the proposed park on 
a "multiple use" basis) has recognized, "in all of the California desert there 
is no finer grouping of different wildlife habitats than in the East Mojave, 
both from the viewpoint of the total number of species and the total number of 
animals."

TEMPLETON'S HOMER IS GRAND; PADRES BEAT ASTROS, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre shortstop Garry Templeton took a casual peek Monday afternoon at the 
Houston Astro lineup before the game. He blinked his eyes and took a hard look. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Glenn Davis. There was no Glenn Wilson. There was no Craig Biggio. 
There was no Rafael Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Four Astro starters were out of the lineup? In the midst of a pennant race? 
What gives, Templeton wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
The reasoning was simple: Each of the players is in the midst of a heavy-duty 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton smiled, started to giggle, and then began laughing until his stomach 
hurt. Slumps? Come on. If you want a slump, he said, take a look at his 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
He was hitting .114 in his past 12 games. He had driven in just one run. He had 
14 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
While so many have contributed during the Padres' winning streak, Templeton was 
hitting .179 with just three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"If they took you out for that," Templeton said, "I'd have been out a long time 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Proving just why Padre Manager Jack McKeon's patience never waned, Templeton 
put together one of the finest offensive performances of his career, leading 
the Padres past the Astros, 7-3, and keeping their playoff hopes intact. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton, hitting his first grand slam in five years, went two for four with a 
double to go along with his homer, driving in a career-tying-high four runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pretty consistent all year putting the ball in play," Templeton 
said, "I don't know why I picked the end of the year to go into a rut. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I just sat down and tried to look at some of the things I've done since 
the All-Star break. I've tried to look at the positive things I've done, rather 
than dwell on the negative." 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, how timing could not have been better. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging onto a precarious 1-0 lead in the sixth, the Padres broke open the game 
against Astro starter Jim Deshaies, who has as much trouble against the Padres 
as Ivan Lendl in Grand Slam championship finals. This is a guy who defeated the 
Padres the first two times he faced them, but has not beaten them since 1986, 
losing his last seven decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton made sure there was no exception on this night. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts, the catalyst of the Padres' offense during their 15-3 streak, 
opened the inning by drawing a walk. He went to second on Roberto Alomar's 
bloop single to center, which extended his hitting streak to a career-high 16 
games. Tony Gwynn, playing for the first time in three games because of a sore 
achilles' heel, flied to left for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Jack Clark hit a double into the left-field corner to score Roberts 
and send Alomar to third. It was Clark's 19th RBI in his past 15 games, and his 
team-high 86th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James, also playing for the first time since jamming his right shoulder 
Friday, strode to the plate. With first base open, and Templeton on deck, the 
logic was simple: Intentionally walk James to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Astro Manager Art Howe then walked to the mound and called upon reliever Danny 
Darwin. Darwin took the ball from Howe, threw eight warmup pitches, and then 
peered at Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the last thing Darwin was thinking about was allowing a grand slam. 
Templeton, in fact, said it was even the last thing he was thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack (McKeon) told me before I went up there," Templeton said, "just to put 
the ball in play. That's all I was trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds reasonable. After all, his last grand slam had been July 29, 1984, when 
Mike LaCoss was still pitching for the Astros. Heck, he had hit just one home 
run in his past 168 at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
He figured he could throw a fastball past Templeton, and keep it low to make 
sure that it would stay on the ground. Instead, Darwin wound up jerking his 
neck, looking over his left shoulder after Templeton swung at the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The ball didn't land until it reached the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 12,705 screamed in delight, making as much noise as they possibly 
could, surrounded by 46,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar, Clark, James and Templeton came across the plate, all becoming part of 
the historic grand slam. It was the fifth of the season for the Padres, the 
most in their 21-year franchise history, and the most in the National League 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you hit a grand slam, it's a little special," Templeton said. "It 
isn't too often you get to hit one." 
</P>
<P>
It proved to be plenty enough for Padre starter Calvin Schiraldi (6 1/3 
innings, four hits, three runs), who won his second consecutive start since 
joining the team two weeks ago. It marked the first time he has won 
back-to-back starts since July 23 and 28, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I threw the ball all right," Schiraldi said. "My pitches were 
down, and we had great defense behind me. Bip made a couple of real nice plays: 
one highlight film, and one to protect his life." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, what Padre victory would be complete during this stretch without the 
heroics of Roberts? 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, just a part-time player until six weeks ago, is as responsible as 
anyone for the Padres' pennant run. Roberts is hitting .329 during their 
streak, with a .420 on-base percentage. He has reached base in 24 of his past 
39 plate appearances, and is hitting .444 with 12 runs scored in his past 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go back and look at who is the most pleasant surprise of the year, 
it's probably him," said McKeon, calling Roberts the best leadoff hitter the 
Padres have had since Alan Wiggins in 1984. "Bip's hitting for a better 
average, but Wiggins was a better base-stealer." 
</P>
<P>
Said Templeton: "I'll tell you what, we sure wouldn't be in the position we're 
in now without Bip. He's been the sparkplug we've needed. You can't 
underestimate the job he's done for us." 
</P>
<P>
But on the night of Sept. 11, let the record show it was Templeton who took the 
curtain call, allowing the Padres' playoff hopes to live a little longer.

MCMAHON STILL FEELS SORE ABOUT HEALTH QUESTION 
</P>

<P>
Maybe what the Chargers really need is a damage control coach. 
</P>
<P>
Their head coach, Dan Henning, continues to confuse. Monday, he was guilty on 
three different fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Their special-teams coach momentarily lost his cool. And a player they waived 
Saturday practiced with them the day after their 40-14 season-opening loss to 
the Raiders. He was unsigned when he did so. As if that wasn't enough, Jim 
McMahon, the quarterback who was supposed to turn the franchise around, sounded 
healthy but unhappy, upon reflection, when asked about Henning's decision to 
remove him in the third quarter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Monday why he came out of the game, McMahon said, "Because the coach made 
the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Asked upon what that decision was based, McMahon said, "I don't know. He's the 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
Asked for his opinion of Henning's decision, McMahon said, "I'm very 
unopinionated." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who completed seven of 18 passes for 91 yards but no touchdowns, also 
said his ribs were still sore but he expected to be able to play next Sunday in 
the Chargers' home opener against Houston. Henning said McMahon would start. 
</P>
<P>
But Henning also said Darryl Usher, the wide receiver he waived Saturday, 
didn't practice Monday. Usher said he did. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, I'm part of the team," Usher said. "But I'm still talking 
with my agent." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Chargers decided to sign Usher. The player who will 
probably be released to make room for him is defensive end Gerald Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said cornerback Sam Seale, burned badly against the Raiders, had a 
leg injury. Seale said he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
And, Henning said, the Chargers' substitutions at center against the Raiders 
were spontaneous and not "orchestrated." Which was one more explanation that 
flew in the face of information from one of his players. After the loss, rookie 
center Courtney Hall said the coaches had told him before the game he would 
play the first half and the fourth period against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, Henning said he will close practice to the 
media. Prior to last week, no Charger coach had ever closed practices for a 
full week. 
</P>
<P>
Special teams coach Joe Madden got downright testy when quizzed about the high 
number of breakdowns by his players Sunday and said he would make "whatever 
changes necessary" to remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But he wouldn't get specific. Henning said the Chargers would look at two free 
agent punters today because Lewis Colbert averaged 34.3 yards on six punts and 
didn't always kick the ball where he was ordered to kick it. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, wide receivers Jamie Holland and Anthony Miller were second and 
third in AFC kick returns. Miller is no longer returning kicks. Asked why, 
Henning said, "Because the other two are in there." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Holland and rookie Victor Floyd. Floyd mishandled one 
kickoff against the Raiders and compounded his error by running backwards into 
the end zone, where he was tackled for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rookie Dana Brinson, the Chargers' leading punt returner in the 
exhibition season, is still waiting for an explanation of why he isn't 
returning punts anymore. He has been replaced by rookie Wayne Walker, who erred 
by fielding a punt inside the 10 against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never clear to me why they stopped using me on punt returns," Brinson 
said. "They haven't said anything, but probably tomorrow . . . you never know." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow the subject kept coming back to McMahon. And the explanations kept 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is this: Early in the third period, McMahon directed a touchdown 
drive that ended in a one-yard run by Marion Butts. It cut the Raider lead to 
28-14. But on the play before the touchdown, McMahon bruised the area around 
his ribs on a three-yard keeper. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Charger possession, Walker's poor decision on the punt return and a 
three-yard penalty backed the Chargers to their three. Henning inserted David 
Archer for McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
From here it starts getting fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Henning said he wanted to get McMahon "out of the line of 
fire." But Archer said McMahon was the one who asked out. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Henning said the poor field position factored into his decision to 
remove McMahon. Henning also said he would have put McMahon back in the game if 
the Chargers had pulled to within seven points. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, Henning found himself answering questions about whether 
or not he had "given up" by replacing McMahon, whom team doctors had cleared to 
go back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it made a great deal of difference at that point," Henning said 
of the switch. "Jim had gotten jolted on the previous series. Field position is 
why I decided to finally go with David." 
</P>
<P>
When did Henning think the Chargers were out of the game? 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to substitute defensive players in the final three minutes," he 
said. By then the Chargers trailed, 40-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he (Henning) gave up," Charger rookie Burt Grossman said. "I was 
under the impression he (McMahon) got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Charger tackle Brett Miller said, "People are always going to second-guess. I 
personally don't think there's anybody out there with the experience or 
knowledge to second-guess Dan Henning." 
</P>
<P>
Said defensive end Leslie O'Neal: "The coach has his reasons. I doubt he gave 
up."

NCAA MISSES POINT; RULE SUITS KICKERS TO A TEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that field goals were increasing scoring at an alarming rate in 
college football, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules makers decided 
to do something about it this year. 
</P>
<P>
We'll fix those soccer-style kickers, they said in essence. We'll take their 
kicking tees away from them for field goals and extra points. 
</P>
<P>
So the kickers were literally grounded. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Division 1-A, the kickers are getting a big boot out of the new 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
In 78 games played so far, field goal kickers have made 191 of 272 attempts, 
70.2%. The NCAA record for a season is 68.2%, set in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really made an impact by taking the tee away," joked Davey Nelson of the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson is the secretary-rules editor of the NCAA Football Rules Committee, who 
pushed for the new kicking rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I never figured (the success rate) would get better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Van Valkenburg, director of statistics for the NCAA, had other figures that 
showed that removing the kicking tee hasn't affected the kickers' accuracy, or 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last week, including a Thursday night game, field goal kickers had a 73.2% 
accuracy rating. That's the third-highest in NCAA history, behind 76% on Nov. 
5, 1988 and 74.1% on Oct. 6, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fewer field goals have been attempted from 40 yards or farther, Van 
Valkenburg said. However, from the 40- to 49-yard range, accuracy is 61.6%, 
compared to a record 57.5% for the 1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moreover, from 50 yards or farther, the nation's kickers have made 45% 
(nine of 20). The season record for such long-distance kicks is 37.3% set in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Total scoring is at 45.2% compared to a record 47.5% last year. Field goal 
production has increased, even though overall scoring is down. 
</P>
<P>
"So field goals are a bigger part of the game at the moment than they ever have 
been," Van Valkenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the extra-point percentage is down, from 95.6% in 1988 
to 94%. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey Nelson once described the extra point as exciting as ice fishing and he 
doesn't need to change his views there," Van Valkenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that kickers are so proficient has nothing to do with the tees, Van 
Valkenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"What Nelson is doing for the kickers is to prove how good they are," he said. 
"That's my interpretation. So far (rules makers) have failed miserably, but 
it's early. (The kickers) haven't run into any bad weather yet." 
</P>
<P>
In adopting the rules change, Nelson noted that scoring has increased from an 
average of 32 points a game in 1958 to 46.1 in 1987 because goal posts were 
widened from 18 feet 6 inches to 23-4 and unlimited substitutions allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nelson had said the major factor in the increase had been the huge 
number of field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Then he said, "Eliminating the tee should have an effect on the kicking game." 
</P>
<P>
Kickers, of course, benefit from kicking off artificial surfaces, though some, 
such as USC's Quin Rodriguez, kick off grass for home games. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez made two 37-yard field goals in USC's 14-13 loss to Illinois Sept. 4 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the adjustment he had to make now that he doesn't use a tee, 
Rodriguez said: "I'm glad that the rule happened. I have more control over the 
ball. When I was kicking off the tee I had more room for error. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more sweet spots on the ball kicking from the tee. You relax more 
with the tee. But when you kick off the ground, you have to concentrate harder, 
following through and having your foot turned just right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the NCAA rule has backfired." 
</P>
<P>
The new rule certainly didn't hinder Arizona's Doug Pfaff, who tied a school 
record with four field goals against Stanford Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people get psyched out by kicking off the ground, but not me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kickers are flourishing under the new rule, with the possible exception of 
Syracuse's John Biskup. He was carrying a heavy burden in Saturday's game 
against Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse kickers had made a record 260 consecutive extra points since the last 
regular-season game of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Biskup made his first two against Temple, then blew the third one -- and the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Kickers have become the leading scorers on most teams. In the Pacific 10 
Conference, only one running back, USC's Marcus Allen, has led the league in 
scoring in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nelson: "When we went to two-platoon football, I said scoring would go 
down because the better players would be on defense. But scoring for two teams 
in a game went from an average of 30 points to 47 points." 
</P>
<P>
Will Nelson present any more legislation to take some of the foot out of 
football? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, bring back the tee," he joked. "Only make it three inches instead of the 
two-inch tee it is now."

NOTRE DAME, MICHIGAN WILL HEAD INTO SATURDAY SHOWDOWN ATOP POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame and Michigan retained the top two spots in the Associated Press 
college football poll heading into Saturday's showdown in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Neither played last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish received 37 first-place votes, 22 more than Michigan. 
Third-ranked Miami was No. 1 on five ballots, with the other three first-place 
votes from sportswriters and broadcasters going to No. 4 Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10 are Auburn, Oklahoma, Clemson, Colorado, Arkansas and 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
There were no changes in the top five, but Oklahoma moved up two spots after 
beating Baylor, 33-7, Clemson rose three places by downing Florida State, 
34-23, and Colorado went from No. 9 to No. 8 after a 45-20 victory over 
Colorado State. Arkansas and Illinois did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which beat Temple, 43-3, jumped three spots to No. 11. Next are West 
Virginia, USC, Pittsburgh, Washington, Alabama, Tennessee, Houston and North 
Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA dropped from No. 6 to No. 20 after its 24-6 loss to Tennessee, which had 
not been ranked. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State, No. 12 last week, dropped out of the rankings after losing to 
Virginia, 14-6. Florida State, which dropped to 0-2 for the first time since 
1976, is unranked for the first time in three years after being No. 16 last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In the United Press International poll, Notre Dame is No. 1, followed by Miami, 
Nebraska, Auburn, Michigan, Clemson, Colorado, Arkansas, West Virginia and 
Syracuse.

USC SHAKES UP RUNNING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC football Coach Larry Smith, unhappy with his offense in last week's season 
opener against Illinois, has made some changes in his starting lineup for 
Saturday night's game at the Coliseum against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Out are tailback Aaron Emanuel and offensive linemen Dan Barnes and Michael 
Moody. In are Ricky Ervins at tailback, Brent Parkinson at guard and Bill 
Schultz at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan running game struggled against Illinois, gaining 70 yards in 39 
carries. Emanuel had 32 yards in 15 attempts, Ervins 31 in 10. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible change looms in the secondary, where sophomore Marcus Hopkins 
is now listed as equal on the depth chart with All-American Cleveland Colter.

MORNING BRIEFING: TALK ABOUT BAD, IT DOESN'T GET MUCH WORSE THAN THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey training camps have opened and hockey writer Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford 
Courant wasted no time in expressing his feelings about Toronto Maple Leaf 
owner Howard Ballard and the National Hockey League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"American fans think (New York Yankee owner) George Steinbrenner is the most 
unreasonable, dictatorial owner in sports," he writes. "Wrong. Toronto Maple 
Leaf owner Howard Ballard has the Boss beat by a country mile. They are the 
NHL's worst, most disorganized franchise. And it won't change until Ballard is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' tirade against Ballard cites treatment of General Manager Gord 
Stellick, who "in one week this summer was belittled so badly that (he) 
resigned," and the handling of George Armstrong, who was forced to coach the 
team when he told everyone he didn't want the job and then was fired after he 
reluctantly accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
When Ballard hired Doug Carpenter as coach the next day, Jacobs quoted Ballard 
talking to Carpenter on the telephone: "If you tell me you have to think it 
over and call me back, don't bother. It's a two-year contract and, if you don't 
like me, you can quit. If I don't like you, I will fire you." 
</P>
<P>
Move over, George. 
</P>
<P>
What friendship tour?That's what some of the Calgary Flames are wondering after 
being swept Monday in their two-game series under that billing with the 
Czechoslovakian national team in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a friendship tour for the first two shifts on the ice, and it hasn't 
been since that," Calgary's Gary Roberts said after the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Least friendly, according to the Flames, was Czech defenseman Leo Gudas, a 
pugnacious player who lashed out at several Flames and blew kisses at them as 
he passed their bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He really got under our skin," Coach Terry Crisp said. 
</P>
<P>
Gudas tried to kick Calgary wing Jonas Bergqvist midway through the second 
period, leading to repeated retaliation by the Flames. Three Calgary players 
drew penalties in less than 2 1/2 minutes as they hooked, tripped and 
manhandled Gudas. 
</P>
<P>
Gudas did have an explanation for his not-so-friendly behavior: "I'm not very 
popular in our league either," he said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts became the seventh player 
in National Football League history to reach 10,000 yards Sunday. He did it 91 
games. How many games did yardage leader Walter Payton need to accomplish the 
feat? 
</P>
<P>
On this date: On Sept. 12, 1979, Carl Yastrzemski got his 3,000th hit -- a 
ground single off Jim Beattie -- as the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red 
Sox, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
On the same date in 1976, Minnie Minoso singled in three trips to the plate as 
the designated hitter for the Chicago White Sox. At 53, he became the oldest 
player to get a hit in a regulation game. 
</P>
<P>
Roaring start: The Oregon Lottery, which gives players a chance to try to beat 
published point spreads on NFL games, had first-week sales of $221,000 for its 
Sports Action betting game, according to director Jim Davey. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Payton reached the milestone in 113 games. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Deion Sanders, the Atlanta Falcons' top draft pick, after a 68-yard 
punt return for a touchdown Sunday against the Rams: "I felt like a deer with a 
hundred hunters after me."

CLOSING ARGUMENTS MADE IN GIOIOSA TAX-FRAUD CASE 
</P>

<P>
Lawyers for Thomas Gioiosa tried to convince a U.S. District Court jury Monday 
that he cashed a winning race-track ticket for Pete Rose out of friendship, not 
as part of a tax-fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa's lawyers said in their closing arguments that federal prosecutors 
failed to prove a conspiracy between Gioiosa and Rose, who lived together from 
1979-84, to defraud the government. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Martin Weinberg said Gioiosa cashed a $47,646 race-track ticket 
for Rose as a favor to the man he admired. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that a conspiracy (to defraud the government) or is that the result of a 
decade-long friendship?" Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member jury began deliberating Monday in Gioiosa's trial on charges of 
tax evasion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who hasn't been charged with any crime, is under investigation by a 
federal grand jury in Cincinnati looking into whether the former Cincinnati 
Reds' manager claimed all his income from gambling, memorabilia sales and 
autograph appearances. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tax counts against Gioiosa involves a $47,646 Pik Six payoff from 
Turfway Park in northern Kentucky that Gioiosa cashed and claimed on his taxes. 
Three witnesses testified that Rose owned the majority share of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Rose wasn't called as a witness. Weinberg tried to use that to Gioiosa's 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, what did Pete Rose do?" Weinberg said. "Did he also report 
the $47,000? We don't know what Pete Rose did. The government hasn't produced 
Pete Rose's tax return." 
</P>
<P>
The government wasn't interested in arguing the point Friday, generally 
avoiding mention of Rose. Instead, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Hunt 
suggested to the jury that Gioiosa was trying to hide his income from cocaine 
involvement and illegal gambling.

"He needed to cover up the illegal money that he was making that he couldn't 
report," Hunt said. "Here was the perfect opportunity for him to seize that 
chance to defraud the IRS."

COACH'S SON LOSES THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK IN NORTHRIDGE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No, it was not a scheme to impress his friends or help his son get drafted. The 
truth be told, Cal State Northridge football Coach Bob Burt had nothing to do 
with Jim Matthews wearing No. 56, instead of his usual No. 63, in the second 
half of Saturday's game against Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
No. 56 belongs to Burt's son, Kevin, a freshman who is third on the Matador 
depth chart at center. But Matthews, an All-Western Football Conference tackle, 
was wearing it after his own uniform ripped. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim came running off the field and Kevin was the first player he thought of 
that he knew wouldn't be playing," Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The switch went unnoticed by Joe Buttitta, who does the play- by-play for CSUN 
broadcasts on KGIL. He reportedly made several comments lauding the coach's son 
for his blocking ability. 
</P>
<P>
Passing fancy: Sherdrick Bonner, making only his second college start, on 
Saturday became the first Northridge quarterback to better the 300-yard mark in 
passing since Chris Parker did it against Cal State Sacramento on Nov. 16, 
1985. Bonner completed 29 of 44 passes for 303 yards and a touchdown as the 
Matadors dropped a 27-20 decision to Fullerton. Four seasons ago Parker 
completed 29 of 46 attempts for 307 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner completed passes to nine receivers, but his favorite target was tight 
end Richard Ane, who pulled in a career-high eight catches for 109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Best foot forward: Glendale College gave him the boot three years in a row when 
he tried out for the Vaquero football team as a place-kicker, but Armando 
Toscano had the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Though none were very pretty, Toscano converted a 34-yard field goal and three 
extra points for Pasadena City College as the Lancers defeated Glendale, 24-16. 
</P>
<P>
"The three years he came out for our team, the kickers we had were just 
better," Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. "He was barely making their kicks on 
Saturday, but he made the extra point that counted and the field goal that 
counted." 
</P>
<P>
Teeing off: The new NCAA rule forbidding the use of a kicking tee on field-goal 
and extra-point attempts did not affect the outcome of Occidental's 
season-opening, 16-14, loss to Menlo College Saturday night, but Occidental 
Coach Dale Widolff expects it to play a big role sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think its a good rule for Division III but I understand that there 
needs to be uniformity," Widolff said. "I think they (the NCAA) were looking 
strictly at the Division I level . . . where Astroturf and better grass fields 
were causing things to be unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
"At the Division II and III levels you're going to find games played on fields 
used for soccer and football practice. So sometimes the attempts will be off 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Widolff also believes the new rule will force coaches to be more adventurous 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot more times when you get to fourth down at the 25- or 
30-yard line that you won't go for a field goal," Widolff said. "You're going 
to see more teams go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Impressive debuts: Louis Vann, a former quarterback, and Jamie Grossman, a 
quarterback who didn't play last season, led Pierce to a thrilling 40-39 
victory over East Los Angeles in a nonconference opener Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Vann, who played quarterback at Van Nuys High in 1987, rushed for 122 yards in 
28 carries and scored three touchdowns against the Huskies. It was the first 
collegiate game at running back for Vann, who attended Valley but did not make 
the traveling squad last season. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, who did not attend college last season after throwing for 1,486 yards 
and 11 touchdowns as a Cleveland High senior in '87, completed seven of 11 
passes for 104 yards and two touchdowns. His final score was a 13-yard strike 
to Shannon Culver with 4:55 left, giving the Brahmas their final margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense played extremely well," Pierce Coach Bob Enger said. "They were in 
mid-season form. They played an error-free game. . . . Vann played extremely 
well in his first college game. He made no mental errors. And the same could be 
said of Grossman." 
</P>
<P>
The same could not be said for the Brahma defense, which gave up 554 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stop them," Enger said. "But they couldn't stop us either. It got 
to the point that every time a team started a drive, you thought they were 
going to score." 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Northridge -- Eric Treibatch, part-time starter at strong 
safety, is out for the season with ligament damage in his left knee. Scott 
Kain, starting right tackle, is doubtful for CSUN's home opener Saturday 
against Sonoma State with a sprained ankle and Allan Chatman, reserve outside 
linebacker, is doubtful for Sonoma State with a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran -- Defensive lineman Eric Bowman and center Pat Wolcott dressed 
for the Sonoma State game last Saturday but were held out because of injuries. 
Bowman has a sprained ankle and Wolcott a broken rib. Both should play against 
St. Mary's this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Roster check: Bill McDonald, a part-time starter for CSUN at free safety, and 
Russell Jenkins, a reserve wide receiver, have quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Reggie Williams, in his third season starting at cornerback, 
missed the Fullerton game for unspecified "personal reasons," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving line: Three Glendale quarterbacks were a combined three for 17 for 75 
yards against Pasadena. Cicuto said the Vaquero passing attack will be aided 
next week by the expected return of split ends David Nattoli and Cody McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Nattoli, a sophomore, is recovering from a hamstring injury. McMahon, a 
freshman, missed the Pasadena game because of a lacerated tendon in his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Rush hour: After netting only 527 rushing yards all last season, Cal Lutheran 
picked up 105 yards on the ground against Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't quite an Oklahoma Sooner land rush, but in one drive Cal Lutheran did 
run the ball eight straight times. The Kingsmen have a veteran offensive line, 
which appeared to block better firing out on rushing plays than dropping back 
into pass protection. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Chesnut led Cal Lutheran last year with a paltry 263 yards, and senior 
Dean Henderson (193 yards) is the leading returning rusher. Forget about 
100-yard games, only three players had 100-yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, though, Henderson ran for 48 yards on 16 carries, and sophomore Jeff 
Lapinski tallied 48 on eight. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Kingsmen rushed for only three yards against Sonoma State and 
had only two games in which they netted more than 100 yards rushing as a team. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking Big (West): Northridge's strong outings against both Fullerton and Cal 
State Long Beach of the Division I Big West Conference inspires a question: Is 
there all that much difference between teams from the Big West and those from 
the Division II Western Football Conference? 
</P>
<P>
Burt, a former defensive coordinator at Fullerton, thinks there is. "What 
people don't take into consideration is that over 11 games, the scholarship 
difference would get more and more apparent. We lost two guys (to injuries) 
against Fullerton. Can you imagine if we lost two a week? We wouldn't have 
anybody left." 
</P>
<P>
Both Fullerton and Long Beach offer roughly 70 full-ride scholarships for 
football. CSUN has less than 30. The Division II limit is 45, while 90 is the 
maximum in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Game plan: Quarterback Mike Dalley directed Antelope Valley to a surprising 
10-3 first-quarter lead over El Camino on Saturday, but freshman Cole Speer 
replaced the sophomore starter in the second period when El Camino took a 
commanding 28-10 lead on its way to a 38-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"With only two nonconference games we had to play as many people as we could 
against El Camino," Marauder Coach Brent Carder explained. "That's why Cole 
came in. I would have liked to keep the first team in there longer, but 
everyone who we might depend on later in the season has to get experience now, 
in the first two nonconference games." 
</P>
<P>
The season-opening defeat was Antelope Valley's worst since 1967, when the 
Marauders lost to Mira Costa, 35-2.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
HOMERS HELP ORIOLES BEAT WHITE SOX, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton and Cal Ripken homered helping Jeff Ballard become the 
season's first American League pitcher to beat every other team Monday night as 
the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton, who started for the first time since Aug. 4, gave the Orioles a 2-0 
lead with his 23rd home run of the season, and first since Aug. 2, in the first 
inning. He went on the disabled list for a knee injury Aug. 5 for nearly a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who drove in the Orioles' first run with a sacrifice fly, broke the 
game open with a two-run homer in the fifth for a 6-2 lead. Ripken has three 
home runs and 10 RBIs in his last nine games. Ballard, the league's winningest 
left-hander, improved to 17-7. Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his 25th save. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox pulled within 6-3 on a run-scoring double by Ivan Calderon in the 
sixth. Ron Karkovice had Chicago's other RBI, driving in a run with a single in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenberg, 4-12, lasted only 1 1/3 innings and gave up three runs, two 
earned, and four hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles took a 3-2 lead with an unearned run in the second. Mike Devereaux 
led off with a single, took second on Rosenberg's wild pickoff and scored on a 
single by Craig Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, Minnesota 1 -- Larry McWilliams, making his first league start, 
gave up three hits in six innings and ended his nine-game losing streak as the 
Royals won at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals pulled to within four games of first-place Oakland in the West. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, 35, was acquired in a trade Sept. 2 from the Philadelphia Phillies, 
where he was 2-11 and had not won since May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 2, Boston 1 -- The Mariners ended an 11-game home losing streak beating 
the Red Sox, 2-1, on six strong innings by Brian Holman and Mike Schooler's 
team-record 27th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners stopped a six-game losing string and sent Boston to its sixth 
straight defeat. The Red Sox fell 10 games behind idle Toronto.

TEAM OF LOCAL YOUTHS TEACHES SOVIETS HOW TO PLAY BALL ON TOUR TO EAST EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's with all these weapons we have pointed at the Soviet Union? In the name 
of goodwill, only one arm was needed to defeat the Red Army -- the lean left 
arm of John Bushart. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart, a pitcher from Thousand Oaks, turned back the Red Army baseball team, 
7-3, during a recent two-week barnstorming tour of the Soviet Union, Finland 
and Sweden with a team called the Baseball Ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
The secret? 
</P>
<P>
 Pssst. The Soviets can't touch a curve. 
</P>
<P>
Can't do much with a country fastball, either. It didn't take much to figure 
that out after the first couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
"They were big and they were great athletes, but they had absolutely no 
baseball skill," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet what the Soviets lack in fundamentals, they make up for in curiosity and 
enthusiasm for the American pastime. 
</P>
<P>
"One of their coaches said they like the game because it reminds them of 
chess," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals will come, Soviet officials are certain, as long as U.S. teams 
continue to share the game's nuances in the spirit of glasnost. A stream of 
teams from the United States has made the trip this summer and a collection of 
minor leaguers from the Eastern League went this month. The Soviets have been 
playing baseball seriously for three years and their goal is to build a team 
capable of winning an Olympic medal by the turn of the century. Baseball has 
been a demonstration sport in the last two Olympics and will be a medal sport 
at Barcelona, , in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Americans stay champions in this century," Soviet sports specialist 
Irakly Kutateladze told the New York Times. "In the next century, we shall 
see." 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors, who instructed Soviet players at clinics in debris-strewn 
warehouses on rainy days and weathered primitive playing facilities, heard the 
same boast. 
</P>
<P>
" 'We shall see,' " Bushart said, imitating the pet Soviet phrase. "That was 
their low-key way of popping off. We heard that before our game with the Red 
Army. 'You are good players, but we shall see.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets got to see firsthand the array of pitches Bushart, 18, will bring 
to Cal State Northridge next year as a freshman. In 5 2/3 innings against the 
Red Army, he struck out 10 and gave up only two hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
That victory Aug. 8 was the Ambassadors' third in as many games against teams 
from Moscow, first stop on the tour. The team then took a train to Leningrad, 
defeated the team there, 12-0, then took a bus to Helsinki, Finland, and a 
cruise ship across the Baltic Sea to Stockholm, Sweden. The only game the 
Ambassadors lost was a 5-2 decision to the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the tour was to promote peace and good-will," said Meiers, who 
has compiled a record of 270-96 during 14 seasons as coach at Arcadia High 
School. Over the last eight years, Meiers has taken Ambassador teams to Europe, 
China, Japan, Fiji and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I only invite players who are interested in teaching the game to people who 
have little proficiency," he said. "The players have to be talented, so we can 
demonstrate quality baseball, but possessing quality character is foremost." 
</P>
<P>
Bushart, who was recommended to Meiers by Thousand Oaks High Coach Jim Hansen, 
fit the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a left-handed pitcher and I'd heard from scouts that John was real 
good," Meiers said. "His coach assured me that he was the type of person we 
were looking for. John was a class act all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Bushart and his teammates, for example, kept their complaints to a minimum when 
they were served hot dogs, peas and warm cola for breakfast their first morning 
in Moscow. And their hosts at the People's Friendship University were "very 
friendly, they really worked hard to make our trip the best," Bushart said. The 
players stayed five to a room in student dorms at the university. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, clearly, the Soviets are trying to catch up on the diamond, although 
most are rough cuts. The nation's first ballpark, at Moscow State University, 
was dedicated recently but the Ambassadors played their games on soccer and 
archery fields at state-run Olympic training facilities. Pitchers' mounds were 
nothing more than rubber mats and baselines were drawn with masking tape. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviet players were in their mid-20s and had been recruited from 
other sports. They then were farmed out to the fledgling baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors defeated the People's Friendship University team, 18-2, and the 
Moscow University Aeronautics team, 30-3, before beating the Red Army -- the 
best Soviet team -- and Leningrad. The Ambassadors, composed mainly of players 
from Arcadia and San Marino, hit 13 home runs in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the outfielders on the Aeronautics team started playing behind the 
fence," Bushart said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when the Ambassadors began to ease up late in the game, an irate Soviet 
official complained to Meiers. 
</P>
<P>
"From a good-will standpoint we didn't want to embarrass them," the coach said. 
"But they insisted that the game was not interesting if we stopped playing 
hard. They wanted to see double plays, running catches, hard swings, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets obviously considered the play a necessary part of learning a 
complex game. 
</P>
<P>
"It blew me away, how much they know already," Meiers said. "I was unbelievably 
impressed. Their skills just need to catch up with their knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
As baseball fever firms its grip, the country is firming its resolve to produce 
a strong national team. The Soviet Baseball Federation has tripled to 50 teams 
and 1,500 players in the three years it has fielded teams. This fall, two of 
the nation's 28 special youth academies for sports prodigies will be staffed 
with baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The players now will never be the Olympians," Meiers said. "These guys are 
being groomed to be the first crop of coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Alternate sources of baseball knowledge are available. A pitcher in Leningrad 
asked Bushart to help him develop a forkball and he obliged. It wasn't the 
Soviet's first trick pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw me a knuckleball and it dropped off the table," Bushart recalled. "I 
asked him where he learned it and he said from reading Jim Bouton's book, 'Ball 
Four.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sharing culture came as easily as exchanging pitching tips. Bushart handed out 
a shoe box full of baseball cards to opposing players and had ample opportunity 
to barter off the field as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart exchanged T-shirts and a pair of old shorts for an authentic soldier's 
cap, a Soviet flag, a fur hat and assorted souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
But the memory of defeating the Red Army team will endure longer than any 
memento. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two games, we had no intensity," he said. "But for the Red Army 
game, we were amped. We came out like it was a championship game." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, he struck out the leadoff batter, got the next batter on a 
comebacker and struck out the No. 3 hitter, an enormous man with a thick beard. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the most hellacious cut I've ever seen on strike 3, a curve down and 
in," Bushart said. "I K'ed him (struck him out) three times."

LOS ALAMITOS RACECOURSE SOLD TO SACRAMENTO HARNESS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Hollywood Park Realty officially announced the sale of Los Alamitos Racecourse 
to a harness-racing interest group from Sacramento. The group, headed by Lloyd 
Arnold, Cal Racing Expo Assn. president, paid a reported $71 million for the 
297 acres, which includes a golf course and undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Arnold in the venture are Buzz Oates, one of the leading builders of 
commercial and industrial buildings in Sacramento, attorney Chris Bardis and 
developer Frank Ramos. The group says it hopes to rebuild the golf course and 
develop some of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is settled, but we hope to run 23 or 24 weeks each of both harness and 
quarter horses," Bardis said from his law office in Sacramento. "We're striving 
for parity and we're hoping that the quarter-horse people will cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get cooperation, it will only become a factor for the next 10 
years of the property (which is when a quarter horse lease on the property runs 
out)." 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation doesn't appear likely. Ed Allred, who also headed a group that 
offered to buy the track and is president of the Horseman's Quarter Horse 
Racing Assn., expects litigation before the issue is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do depends on what they say they will do for us," Allred said. "It 
could be done peaceably but I suspect it will not be that way. Under an 
agreement with Hollywood Park we were entitled to 30 weeks of racing and there 
is no way we will ever accept anything less than that. We have a lot of 
options, even if that means running at another track." 
</P>
<P>
The HQHRA has a lease with Hollywood Park that extended to 2002. 
</P>
<P>
Bardis said there would be no major improvements in the physical state of the 
facility until racing at the track becomes profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Forgnone, an attorney representing Hollywood Park, said the track will now 
attempt to reduce what remains of the $100 million debt. He said two options 
available to the track were the selling of property near the Inglewood track or 
through a public stock offering.

CARSON'S VOLLNOGLE HOPES 5TH TIME IS REPEAT CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the 1989 City high school football season starting this weekend, Carson's 
Gene Vollnogle is in a familiar position -- coaching the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Carson defeated arch-rival Wilmington Banning, 55-7, in the City 
4-A Division final, earning Vollnogle his seventh City title at Carson and his 
ninth overall. 
</P>
<P>
With several key players back from last season's 12-1 team, the Colts and 
Vollnogle, who is starting his 27th season at Carson, are favored to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
Winning consecutive titles has been difficult for Vollnogle, however. He has 
accomplished the feat only once at Carson, in 1971 and '72. Since then, 
Vollnogle's Colts have lost in the title game after a City championship season 
four times, in 1973, 1983, 1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Colts this season will be quarterback Armin Youngblood, 
who played mainly as a swingback last season and scored 11 touchdowns. His 
primary targets are Tydus Winans and Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Nkosi Littleton, 6-feet-2 and 220 pounds, an All-City selection last 
season who has been chosen on several preseason All-American teams, is the key 
to Carson's defense. The secondary will be led by junior defensive backs 
Clayvand Thomas and Tarriel Hopper, who also punts. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Banning stands as the Colts' main threat to repeating, having 
defeated Carson in title games in 1983 and 1985. Last season, the Pilots 
finished 11-3, losing twice to Carson. Despite the loss of fullback Derek 
Sparks, who transferred to Montclair Prep in Van Nuys this fall, Banning is 
loaded with talent. 
</P>
<P>
Returning is quarterback John Ma'ae, who completed 56% of his passes for more 
than 1,200 yards last season. Ma'ae, also a dangerous runner, is one of the 
best quarterbacks in Southern California. The main target of his passes will be 
junior Michael James, who excelled in passing leagues this summer. On defense, 
linebacker John Herrera is the Pilots' main force, along with defensive back 
Nizam Walter. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando finished 8-4 last season and figures to be a strong contender, 
largely on the passing of 6-3 senior quarterback Michael Wynn, who completed 
108 of 209 passes for 1,614 yards and 24 touchdowns last season. In last 
season's semifinal playoff game against Banning, Wynn threw for nearly 250 
yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, which defeated Carson two seasons ago in the City championship 
game, is another talented San Fernando Valley team. Quarterbacks Chris 
Gadomski, who passed for 1,158 yards last season, and Bryan Martin, a transfer 
from Illinois, will lead an offense loaded with experienced skill-position 
players. Leon Glasgow and Brett Washington will handle the Highlanders' rushing 
attack, with William Moringlane and Jermaine Love the top receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Dorsey had what many considered the most talented team in the City 
in finishing 9-3. The Dons played every game tough, suffering two close losses 
to Carson and one to Banning. In their semifinal game against Carson, the Dons 
led 13-0 before losing 14-13 on a late Colt touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
This season Dorsey will rely on the talents of wide receiver-defensive back 
Kevin Copeland, who scored 11 touchdowns last season. The versatile Copeland 
caught 33 passes for more than 660 yards last season, and returned two punts 
for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate, the defending 3-A Division champions, finished with a 14-0 record 
in winning its first City title since 1955. The Rams will again be the team to 
beat, thanks largely to running back Ivan Wilson, the 3-A player of the year 
last season. As a junior, Wilson rushed for 1,979 yards and 23 touchdowns. 
Returning with Wilson is Marco Diaz, who made all-conference last season at 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, which has won two of the last three City 3-A Division titles, will be 
strong again, despite the graduation of All-City running back Lamont Lovett, 
who became the City's first 2,000-yard rusher last season. Returning for the 
Panthers is Lamont's brother, Lamar, who also made All-City last season as a 
defensive back, and quarterback Santiago Alvarez, who directed Franklin to a 
11-1 mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester, which lost to South Gate in the title game last season, will be 
looking for its third consecutive appearance in a City final. In 1987, 
Westchester won the last 2-A Division title. This season, the Comets will be 
led by tailback Tim Holliday, who averaged 7.1 yards a carry in rushing for 
1,202 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday rushed for 172 yards in Westchester's upset semifinal playoff victory 
over Franklin, which ended the Panthers' 20-game winning streak. Returning with 
Holliday will be backfield mates Walter Grissom and Chris Bacus, who will run 
behind a veteran offensive line led by three-year starter Calvin Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Backs to watch: Armin Youngblood of Carson, John Ma'ae of Banning, Michael Wynn 
of San Fernando, Kevin Copeland of Dorsey, Ivan Wilson of South Gate, Lamar 
Lovett of Franklin, Tim Holliday of Westchester, running backs Mario Mattison 
of Fairfax, Jerome Casey of Sylmar, Shon Ellerbe of Crenshaw, Ontiwaun Carter 
of Kennedy of Granada Hills and Jay Fields of Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern Section games last week, the Times' second-ranked team, Bishop Amat 
of La Puente, lost on the road to No. 9 Riverside Rubidoux, 14-7. Also losing 
was No. 4 Canyon Country Canyon, which played without injured star tailback 
Chris Peery, to Newhall Hart, 30-12. On the winning side, top-ranked Fontana 
rolled to a 47-0 victory over Montclair; Loyola of Los Angeles defeated St. 
Paul of Sante Fe Springs, 28-6, with tailback Kahlil McAlpin running for 133 
yards in eight carries; Paramount defeated Johnson of Sacramento, 39-6, with 
Leon Neal rushing for 166 yards on 10 carries, and Los Alamitos crushed Marina 
of Huntington Beach, 42-22, as quarterback Todd Gragnano passed for 280 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Altos' 13-0 victory over El Rancho of Pico Rivera, defensive end Mike 
Collins made 11 tackles, caused three fumbles and returned an interception 25 
yards for a touchdown. In Lompoc's 45-24 victory over Beverly Hills, junior 
running back Napoleon Kaufman rushed for two touchdowns and returned a kickoff 
and an interception for two more, with one punt return touchdown nullified 
because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich, the winningest active coach in the Southern 
Section, will have surgery for a broken right leg this week, after being hit by 
one of his running backs last week in practice. Ancich, who coached at St. Paul 
for 19 years and is in his sixth season at Tustin, has 218 victories and claims 
that he has not missed a game in 28 years. He is doubtful, however, for the 
Tillers' game against Mater Dei Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Key games this weekend include two Southern Section-City matchups. Friday 
night, Carson, whose only loss last season was to Bishop Amat, will travel to 
La Puente for a rematch, and Banning will take on Long Beach Poly at Veterans 
Stadium in Long Beach. Thursday night, Los Alamitos will play host to Anaheim 
Servite at Gahr High.

TWO CALIFORNIA FIRMS ACCUSED OF FUTURES FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-PRESSURE TACTICS, MISLEADING CLAIMS CITED IN AGENCY SUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filing the largest fraud suit in its 
14-year history, on Monday accused two companies operating in California of 
using high-pressure tactics to earn massive commissions from customers who were 
suffering enormous losses. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC charged International Trading Group Ltd. of making misleading claims in 
the sale of futures options that produced $283 million in commissions for the 
firm but $428 million in losses for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory commission also sued Siegel Trading Co., whose customers lost 
$33.6 million while the company collected $40 million in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixed Price for Delivery 
</P>
<P>
Both firms promised customers a chance to earn big profits with little risk, 
CFTC said in suits filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. It quoted 
International Trading salesmen, who earned 40% commissions on their 
transactions, as telling potential customers: "You don't have time to think it 
over -- you must take action now -- I've only got two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The companies deal in a variety of options on futures contracts for 
agricultural commodities, precious metals, foreign currencies and financial 
instruments, according to CFTC officials. 
</P>
<P>
A futures option gives the right to buy or sell a futures contract, which in 
turn provides a fixed price for delivery of a commodity at a later date. A 
modest investment in an option contract can control a much larger value in a 
commodity, and price movements are highly volatile. International Trading, 
based in San Mateo, Calif., has offices there and in San Francisco, Foster 
City, Newport Beach, San Diego, Honolulu and Coconut Grove, Fla. Siegel, based 
in Chicago, has offices in Los Angeles and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Diamond, an attorney for International Trading, said: "The company 
believes that its sales practices are carried out in compliance with the law 
and are not misleading or fraudulent. The company intends to vigorously defend 
the suit." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said: "There are plenty of profitable transactions done on options" 
bought through the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel Trading had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC charged that the firms made false and deceptive statements about the 
potential for profit, the need to act immediately and the risk of losing money. 
</P>
<P>
"The most graphic example of the lack of truth is . . . (that) the customers 
lost $428 million," Dennis Klejna, the CFTC enforcement director, told a news 
conference, referring to the International Trading Case. "The representations 
(to customers) about profits and losses are not true." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Commissions 
</P>
<P>
CFTC did not challenge the size of the commissions, which are not subject to 
federal regulation, even though CFTC officials said the unusually high 
percentages charged by the two firms made it extremely difficult for investors 
to earn profits. 
</P>
<P>
International Trading charged a commission of 40% of a client's investment. 
Siegel charged a 45% commission plus a fee of $155 for each trade. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, CFTC officials said, common commissions in the industry range from 
$45 to $100 per transaction. They said one firm using a percentage basis 
charges 5% of the money invested, up to maximum of $100. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC said 85% of the customers of International Trading Group and Siegel 
Trading have lost money since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC asked for preliminary court injunctions to stop the alleged sales frauds 
and for the appointment of receivers to take control of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said International Trading Group's "sales techniques include 
manipulation of investors' fears, dreams and greed, emphasizing profits over 
risks, pressuring prospects to make immediate decisions, promising special 
service and investment advice, using automatic responses to overcome customer 
objections and employing 'closings' to pressure prospects into buying 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Solicitation 
</P>
<P>
International Trading salesmen did most of their work on the telephone, the 
suit said. It quoted salesmen as telling prospective customers: "I don't want 
you to take a chance on losing this great price -- I haven't seen them this 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
"If within three minutes you don't know how many dollars he (the customer) 
wants to put in, you haven't done your job," International Trading told its 
salesmen, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel sought new customers through telephone solicitations and a 15-minute 
television program broadcast every day on cable-TV channels, with sales 
representatives playing the role of news broadcasters, CFTC said. It said sales 
personnel were required to make up to 100 calls a day seeking new business. 
</P>
<P>
A typical Siegel sales pitch, it said, included: "I would recommend the sugar 
option immediately. Time is of the essence. . . . When this market moves, it 
moves fast. . . . It is one of the last chances we have to buy silver at under 
$7 an ounce." 
</P>
<P>
CFTC Chairman Wendy L. Gramm said the filing of Monday's lawsuits demonstrated 
that her agency was "ready to take any and all steps necessary to protect the 
public and the integrity of the markets through aggressive enforcement actions 
that affect all aspects of the futures industry."

Study Says Junk Bonds Not As Risky: High-yield junk bonds are not as risky as 
recent studies suggest and earned higher returns than high-grade corporate and 
government bonds between 1977 and 1988 after the effects of defaults, says a 
new study by two researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School 
of Business. The study, which claims to dispute a recent report by former 
researchers at Harvard's Graduate School of Business Administration, says that 
junk bonds returned 8.5% annually over the decade, better than 
intermediate-term Treasury bonds at 7.6%.

EPIC HEALTHCARE SUES AMI OVER MERGER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Epic Healthcare Group has sued American Medical International, alleging that 
the Beverly Hills hospital management firm may avoid meeting certain financial 
obligations by proceeding with a planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Thursday, seeks at least $200 million in punitive damages for 
alleged fraud surrounding AMI's July 6 agreement to be acquired by an investor 
group led by First Boston and a company financed by Chicago's Pritzker family. 
The $1.9-billion deal is scheduled to be completed Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale is completed, the suit claims, AMI would be unable to assume 
responsibility for any tax obligations and legal claims against 36 former AMI 
hospitals before they were sold to Epic last year for $830 million. The suit 
said AMI agreed to assume such responsibility before Dallas-based Epic acquired 
the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Claimed 
</P>
<P>
The planned sale of AMI, the suit charges, "will render AMI's assets beyond the 
reach of any claims asserted by Epic pursuant to the indemnity agreement by 
burdening AMI with more than $2.4 billion of debt, liens on all of its assets 
and substantial and oppressive interest payment obligations. . . . The (sale) 
will be consummated with actual intent to defraud Epic . . . or will render AMI 
unable to pay its debts as they become due." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to punitive damages, the suit asks the court to freeze an 
unspecified amount of AMI's assets to ensure that the company meets financial 
obligations related to any lawsuits or tax liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
AMI, now composed of 77 health-care facilities worldwide, said it will contest 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"It is utterly without merit," said Suzanne Hovdey, spokeswoman for AMI, adding 
that the suit would not upset AMI's merger plans. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts said AMI and Epic will probably negotiate any 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is something that can -- and should -- be dealt with quickly," 
said Rae Alperstein, a securities analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, Alperstein said the suit created some uncertainty about the merger, 
slightly dampening interest in AMI stock. AMI shares closed Monday at $24.125, 
down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Alperstein said some traders are 
responding to rumors that the acquisition price may be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Unexpected 
</P>
<P>
"There's nervousness over when this (merger) will be done," Alperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst, Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said the 
lawsuit was not unexpected. He said Epic filed the suit to get stronger 
financial guarantees from AMI. Abramowitz said Epic would not have as much 
negotiating leverage if it waited until a merger was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is commonplace," he said. "This is when plaintiffs have the most 
negotiating power." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, AMI said Monday that it has reached a definitive 
agreement to sell its 64% interest in Professional Healthcare Systems, a 
management services subsidiary, to the employees of that operation. PHS 
provides computerized programs for payroll and accounting services to AMI 
facilities and 80 other hospitals.

Dunkin' Donuts Rejects Offer: Dunkin' Donuts said it has rejected a $45-a-share 
bid from a Canadian partnership seeking to take over the company by means of a 
$308-million merger. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert M. Rosenberg said in a 
news release that the offer by D D Acquisition Corp. "does not reflect the 
maximum value achievable" for stockholders and that the Massachusetts-based 
chain's advisers are exploring alternatives, including remaining independent or 
a possible sale. D D Acquisition is a partnership between Cara Operations Ltd., 
a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capital Group, the merchant 
banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann's Unicorp Canada Corp.

U.S. AUTO MAKERS ASK OIL FIRMS TO JOIN STUDY OF CLEAN-BURNING FUELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers have sent a letter to major oil companies with 
details of a proposed joint industry research project intended to assess the 
clean-air merits of gasoline and alternative fuels, industry officials 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by executives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and 
Chrysler Corp., was sent to oil company representatives within the last two 
weeks and contained details of a research program to be undertaken by a joint 
industry task force, said Helen O. Petrauskas, Ford vice president for 
environmental and safety engineering in Dearborn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The letter grew out of a series of meetings among top executives and 
lower-level officials of several oil companies and auto makers on ways to deal 
with impending federal clean-air proposals that could mandate the use of 
alternative fuels such as methanol. 
</P>
<P>
Auto and oil executives, wary of mandates that would require costly wholesale 
changes in their industries, have argued that improved gasoline should be 
studied along with methanol, compressed natural gas and other fuels as a way to 
reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting in July 
</P>
<P>
"The letter was indeed received by the oil companies," said Arthur H. Bentley, 
a spokesman for Unocal Corp., one of the oil companies involved in joint 
industry talks. "There will be a meeting (perhaps) later this week of an oil 
industry working group at lower levels to kick it around . . . to go over the 
proposal and see if they can agree with it. If they can, it could be as early 
as the middle of next week when the CEOs or their designates get together 
somewhere . . . for final approval." 
</P>
<P>
Top executives of the three auto makers last met July 20 in Detroit with 
leaders of Atlantic Richfield Co., Amoco Corp., Shell Oil Co., Texaco Inc. and 
Chevron Corp. Lower-level officials of those and other companies have since met 
to hammer out the project's details. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had ongoing discussions with them for some time, and correspondence at 
all levels, related to what kind of research might make sense for us to do 
jointly, as opposed to separately," Petrauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Much Progress 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the three auto makers have "a pretty good idea" what shape that 
research should take, she added. Among other things, they favor assessing the 
relative air quality benefits of specific fuels and vehicles taken as a single 
system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be unfair to my colleagues to say that we've made a lot of 
progress since August," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both auto and oil industries vehemently denied a report in the 
trade weekly Automotive News suggesting that the joint industry talks were 
intended to quash methanol or other alternative fuels in favor of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inaccurate to imply, as that story does, that the petroleum industry is 
trying to kill methanol as a motor fuel," said Arthur E. Wiese, a spokesman for 
the American Petroleum Institute, the main industry trade group. "We're not 
opposed to methanol per se; we're opposed to mandating it as long as there are 
so many unanswered environmental, technological and economic questions about 
it."

Mosbacher Criticizes Japan: U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher slammed 
Japan for closing its markets to American goods and services but praised South 
Korea for opening its markets wider. Mosbacher told South Korean business 
leaders that Washington applauded Seoul's spirit of cooperation in response to 
trade pressure, imposed in particular through the 1988 U.S. Trade Act. But he 
was critical of Japan's efforts and promised to voice his criticism when he 
visits Tokyo today after his visit to Seoul. "We opened our markets. And we 
worked to create a trading system that would allow for everyone to prosper. Now 
it's Japan's turn to show the same kind of commitment to the world trading 
system," Mosbacher said.

Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.64%, down from 7.88% last week. Another 
$7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
7.64%, down from 7.87% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month 
bills sold for 7.54% on Nov. 7, and six-month bills averaged 7.35% on July 31. 
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.9% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,806.90 and 8.06% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,613.80. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

U.S. WEIGHS PLAN TO LEASE SURPLUS SAUDI CRUDE OIL TO FILL RESERVE 
</P>

Saudi Arabia, looking for extra cash, and the United States, looking for 
cut-rate oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, are discussing a novel 
Saudi proposal to lease crude oil to this country, government officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A long-term lease would enable the Saudis to earn revenue for surplus oil that 
they cannot sell because of production quotas adopted by the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries. It would enable the United States to acquire oil 
for the strategic reserve without having to pay market prices for it, according 
to Energy Department officials and independent oil industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis are actively promoting the arrangement, informed sources said, but 
the U.S. reaction has been cautious. An agreement to put oil nominally owned by 
Saudi Arabia under U.S. control for use in an energy emergency has political, 
strategic and economic implications that have not been thought through, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer discussed the leasing idea last week at a 
meeting with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and Deputy Secretary W. Henson 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis brought it up," Moore said Sunday. "We informed Nazer that his 
interest is of interest to us, and if he wants to forward a detailed proposal, 
we'll look at it."

DAI-ICHI KANGYO BANK IS PROSPECTIVE BUYER; 
</P>
<P>
MANNY HANNY EXPECTED TO SELL ITS CIT GROUP

Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Monday that it is in "serious discussions" 
with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan regarding joint ownership of its wholly 
owned CIT Group, a commercial finance company. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts said Manufacturers Hanover will likely sell the unit and 
that it could bring up to $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman wouldn't comment beyond a brief statement 
issued by the New York-based banking company. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Manufacturers Hanover will likely sell all of the commercial 
finance company to Dai-Ichi Kangyo as part of an effort to shore up its 
capital. The bank is among the most heavily exposed of major U.S. financial 
companies to Third World debt. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese news report said the deal was worth $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that they will go all the way," said Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods 
analyst James McDermott. "Manufacturers Hanover is under pressure to build its 
capital base." 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover's stock rose $2.875 a share to $42.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange on Monday on the news of a potential sale of the unit, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's seventh-largest 
banking company, would gain $400 million from the sale of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover acquired CIT Group from RCA Corp. in 1984 for $1.5 
billion. RCA has since been taken over by General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
CIT, a nationwide business financing company used mainly by mid-sized 
companies, had assets of $9.3 billion at the end of 1988. Last year, CIT's 
profit was $120 million and it employed about 2,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
"CIT is not a crown jewel. It is starting to make money, but after finance 
costs and amortization it does not add anything to Manufacturers Hanover's 
bottom line," said Bear Stearns analyst Mark Alpert. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert said the sale of CIT for $1.5 billion would be "very positive," reducing 
Manufacturers' need for new capital, removing 13% of its assets off its books 
and eliminating $450 million of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said the bank could use 
profits from the sale to build its Third World loan reserves, making it less 
exposed to Third World debt. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said Manufacturers Hanover was doing everything it could in the 
next couple of weeks to raise its stock price so that it could sell common 
stock soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad they have to sell it (CIT) rather than making it work for them," 
an analyst said. "Going forward, a money center bank has to have a unique 
business to survive. Commercial finance is such a lucrative business."

ICF Inc., an environmental consulting firm, said it has won a three-year, 
$37-million contract with the Environmental Protection Agency to help the 
agency study global climate change. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairfax, Va., company said it will assist the EPA in analyzing the impact 
of global warming and depletion of the Earth's ozone layer on human health and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
ICF also said it would help the agency assess the feasibility of applying new 
technology to curb climate change; develop computer models to predict future 
climate change, and formulate international policies to address those problems. 
</P>
<P>
ICF said it previously worked with the agency on the Montreal Protocol, the 
international agreement to reduce industrial emissions linked with ozone 
depletion.

HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO COOL; SALES STILL HOT

Amid signs that the superheated housing market of earlier this year has 
returned to normal, average prices of existing houses in metropolitan San Diego 
continued to level off in August from previous months, according to sales 
statistics released Monday by the San Diego Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Although prices stabilized, a record number of transactions closed. A total of 
1,599 houses and condominiums were sold in August, the highest number since the 
board was "regionalized" in 1983 with the merger of the El Cajon, La Mesa, 
Chula Vista and San Diego realty boards. The 1,599 units sold in August were 
12% more than the 1,427 units closed in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although August's average sale price of $213,870 was up 23% from the August, 
1988, average, the resale price remained in a range that has changed little 
since April of this year, when an all-time average record price of $217,802 was 
set. Housing transactions that were closed in August generally were initiated 
in June and July, board spokeswoman Karen Rountree said. 
</P>
<P>
The August median price, or the price at which half of all houses sell for more 
and half for less, was $180,000, a 22% increase over the $148,000 median price 
in August, 1988, but up only $5,000 from the $175,000 record median set in 
April of this year, Rountree said. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication that the market is cooling off is that houses generally are 
staying on the market longer before selling, said William David, a broker with 
ERA-United Realtors in the Mira Mesa area. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Throckmorton, a broker-owner of Century 21-Regents Properties in the 
University City area, described the housing market as having returned to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"You have buyers and sellers out there now," Throckmorton said. "You cannot 
presume that you can list your house today and sell tomorrow. Properties that 
appear to be well-priced have a marketing time of from 30 to 45 days, compared 
to three to four days up until the middle of June." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Casey, a vice president with Home Federal Savings, said the activity 
slowdown in recent weeks may be connected to an uptick in mortgage rates in 
August. Interest on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages dipped to as low as 9.5% in 
early August, before jumping back to as high as 10.375% now, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
The market is due to cool off because home buyers are stretching their finances 
to the maximum to qualify for loans. Also, much of the strength in the housing 
market earlier this year was supplied by existing homeowners who traded up for 
more expensive houses. Much of that trading up has now been accomplished, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick McGill, a senior first vice president at Great American Bank, said his 
perception was that the local housing market is "still strong but not 
overheated," based on his S&amp;L's "still pretty good" lending activity.

COUNCIL ADOPTS ORDINANCE TO CUT RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council adopted an ordinance Monday that will require 
employers to find ways to reduce travel by employees during peak hours in order 
to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also voted to create a new transportation management division, 
which will be staffed by about 10 people, to administer the ordinance, which 
takes effect Jan. 1. The start-up cost of the program is estimated at a little 
more than $1 million, which will come from a variety of sources, including the 
federal government and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to charges from critics who say the city is only creating a new 
bureaucracy, the council said it will fund the new division for only three 
years and then review its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is working, the burden will be on the council to reinstitute it or it 
will go out of business," said Councilman Ron Roberts. "The council will have a 
very comprehensive review of the program at the end of that period. We'll see 
what it's costing us, and what it is accomplishing." Another possibility is 
that another agency may assume responsibility for adminis 
</P>
<P>
tering the program, Roberts added. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance will affect businesses that employ at least 15 persons. 
Angela Leira, a staff aide to the council's Transportation and Land Use 
Committee, said businesses with 50 or more employees will be required to submit 
their plans first. According to Leira, employers will have to "pick from a menu 
of options" provided to them by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the council began working on the new ordinance in late 1987. The 
new law was drafted with the participation of the business community, which 
gave the ordinance wide support. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reduce the number of cars on the road during peak hours basically 
by working with all employers throughout the city to develop plans and get them 
involved with transportation management," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's City Council meeting, several council members talked about the need 
to pass the local ordinance before the Air Pollution Control District forces 
its standards on San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act requires the APCD to establish local standards to 
east traffic congestion and reduce pollution by July, 1991, where such 
standards do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be largely voluntary, Leira said, but the administrator of the 
new division and the city attorney's office will be authorized to assess 
penalties and fines against business that do not submit a plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The penalties will be left up to the administrator of the program. He will 
look at the circumstances and go from there," Leira said. 
</P>
<P>
All proposed penalties will have to be reviewed and approved by the City 
Council, Roberts added. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have criticized this as too lenient, but we want to try to get 
people working together with the city in good faith to accomplish things. The 
philosophy is to get people involved in how they relate to the congestion 
problems facing us all," said Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
The drafting resulted from a joint effort by the city Engineering and Planning 
departments working with a citizens advisory group made up of employers. 
Employees will be encouraged to take public transportation, ride bicycles, car 
pool or walk to work. Employers will also be encouraged to utilize staggered 
work hours, said Leira. 
</P>
<P>
Some backers of the program say it could reduce traffic congestion by about 10% 
in the next two years.

FISCAL STRAITS PERIL LA JOLLA DRAMA SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse announced Monday that its 1990 theater season is in 
jeopardy and that the organization needs to raise $500,000 by the end of the 
year "to assure that there will be a 1990 season." 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse released the statement detailing a $1-million fund-raising 
program in the wake of rumors of wobbly finances and an unfavorable financial 
report from the California Arts Council last month. 
</P>
<P>
The theater plans to raise $500,000 by Dec. 31 and another $500,000 by June 30, 
1990, as a cash reserve to offset an accumulated deficit of $703,000. 
</P>
<P>
Playhouse Managing Director Allan Levey said the 1990 season cannot happen 
unless that initial $500,000 is raised. "It would not be prudent," Levey said, 
"which is why we want to broaden the base of our contributed income by going to 
the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
Widely considered a major theatrical force locally and nationally since its 
rebirth in 1983 under artistic director Des McAnuff, the La Jolla Playhouse has 
suffered financially from short seasons that have made high running and 
production costs difficult to offset. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully expect we'll raise the money," McAnuff added. "It's our obsession and 
our focus at the moment," he said, acknowledging, however, that, if they don't, 
"there will have to be a backup plan." 
</P>
<P>
Levey said, "We have the shortest playing time and smallest number of seats of 
any LORT (League of Resident Theaters) theater," adding that, because of the 
playhouse's tie-in with UC San Diego, on whose campus it resides, "we have a 
fixed move-out date every year. It can't change because the university needs 
the theater." 
</P>
<P>
The deficit, which began in the third season, accrued drastically in 1987 by 
$500,000. In fiscal 1988 it grew by $200,000. This was due, Levey said, to a 
shortfall in contributed income and poor single-ticket sales -- a condition 
that appears to have persisted. 
</P>
<P>
According to Levey, McAnuff and board president Mason Phelps, the situation 
will be alleviated once two new projected on-campus theaters are completed: the 
$5-million, 400-seat Weiss Forum (expected to be ready in May, 1991), and a 
400-seat black box to be built within the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Those will allow us to expand to a nine-month season and to generate more 
funds," Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
Money for construction of the Forum is available, but, according to Phelps and 
Levey, construction bids came in over budget, forcing the university to 
redesign the theater and reopen the bidding, in compliance with state 
procedure. This has delayed completion by a full year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Full Solution to Problem' 
</P>
<P>
The third theater, which Phelps and Levey say represents "the full solution to 
the problem," will be funded by a $6.8-million capital campaign, to be kicked 
off by the current fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Forum is complete," Levey said, "we'll be able to earn an additional 
$300,000 a year, based on the income potential of 150 seats more than we now 
have at the Warren Theatre (the playhouse's current second space). In addition, 
he said, "There will be no accumulated deficit in 1989. In fact, we will reduce 
the deficit by $60,000. We'll end this season with a balanced budget." 
</P>
<P>
"Without that third theater," McAnuff said, "we can't have the access we need. 
That access will enable us to operate year-round. It will give us the ability 
to extend hit productions, something we don't have at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Both Levey and McAnuff insist that producing fewer plays a year will not solve 
the problem. "Administrative overhead remains the same," Levey said. "We can't 
hire staff seasonally. Reducing the number of plays is not a solution. There's 
no way to operate a LORT theater on this basis. We're the only theater that 
does that -- for good reason. It can't be done." 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff said, "It's been a huge strain. We know we cannot realistically expect 
these sums of money from the same small group of people. We have to expand our 
contributed income base." 
</P>
<P>
Despite criticism, sometimes from some of his own board members, that he spends 
too much on lavish productions, McAnuff doesn't think he should have done it 
any differently. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could have 10 'A Walk in Woods' and 10 'The Fool Show' (low-expense, 
high-income productions), maybe. But the solution is not two-character plays," 
he said. "With special projects come certain kinds of underwriting. When we do 
larger shows, we always try to identify funds that will take care of those 
(larger) expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund gave us a grant of $126,000 to help 
bring in 'The Grapes of Wrath.' Expenses on 'Dangerous Games' were shared with 
the Spoleto Festival USA, and Philadelphia's American Music Theatre Festival. 
The key is getting through 1990 and, frankly, we'll do whatever it takes. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving birth to an arts institution in the 1980s is a very daring 
undertaking," McAnuff added. "I think it's a miracle that we've done as well as 
we have." 
</P>

L.A. SAYS CUT IN ITS SHARE OF MONO WATER WOULD AFFECT ENTIRE STATE

California's water supplies are so intertwined that any forced reduction in Los 
Angeles' diversions from the Mono Lake Basin will have "social, economic and 
environmental" impacts on the entire state, an attorney for the city warned 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a state Water Resources Control Board hearing, Janet Goldsmith 
urged the panel as it begins an exhaustive examination of water rights in the 
eastern Sierra Basin to give the same consideration to the needs of people in 
Southern California as it does to the environmental requirements of the Mono 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
If the board ultimately determines that the city must reduce the amount of 
water it diverts from streams that naturally flow into the lake, she said the 
only "available source of replacement water" would be the Metropolitan Water 
District, an important supplier to numerous other agencies in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Additional demands from the city, she said, could then affect the amount of 
water available from the district to others in its service area. In most years, 
the Mono Lake Basin provides about one-seventh of the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Goldsmith said Los Angeles would be faced with "millions of 
dollars a year" in extra costs associated with purchasing replacement water if 
it has to curtail its Mono Basin diversions. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that this review scrutinize with 
equal thoroughness the effects of various levels of city diversions on both the 
Mono Basin environmental values and the economic, social and environmental 
values elsewhere in the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith was one of several interested parties invited to comment on the 
board's plan for a 3 1/2-year review of the city's water rights in the Mono 
Basin. The board is under court order to revise the licenses issued to the city 
in 1974 that permit the water diversions. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Wilson, an attorney for two environmental groups -- the National Audubon 
Society and the Mono Lake Committee -- argued that state laws protecting fish 
virtually dictate that the board force the city to reduce its diversions 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
The laws require the operator of any dam to allow enough water to flow past it 
to maintain "in good condition fish that exist or may be planted below the 
dam." Acknowledging that the board will have to determine how much water will 
be required for the fish in the Mono Basin streams, he estimated that possibly 
as much as 60% to 80% of the water now taken by the city may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"These (requirements) are not something that can be balanced away by the 
board," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mono Lake, just east of Yosemite National Park in the Eastern Sierra, has been 
the center of controversy for decades. Environmentalists claim that nesting and 
migratory birds and brine shrimp that thrive in its alkaline waters have been 
endangered by the city's diversions. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1941, when the diversions began, the surface of the lake has fallen 45 
feet, its volume has been decreased by half and its salinity has been doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The city, claiming that the high-quality water is needed to serve an exploding 
urban population, insisted that there had been no permanent damage to the 
ecosystems from the diversions. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, numerous lawsuits have been filed by environmental groups, most 
of which were recently coordinated before the El Dorado County Superior Court 
as the Mono Lake Water Rights Cases. The court has delayed further judicial 
proceedings until 1993 to allow the state water board to complete its review.

ZSA ZSA'S DAY IN COURT PROVES BOFFO BOX OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
ACTRESS'S TRIAL DRAWS BIG MEDIA TURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor took no chances Monday, showing up for trial in Beverly Hills 
without the $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible that got her into trouble with 
police three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, for her first day as a criminal defendant, she cruised into town 
virtually incognito -- just another passenger in just another white Chevrolet 
station wagon. That distinguished-looking driver? That was just her husband, 
Prince Frederick von Anhalt of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the Rolls after what happened," Gabor said during a 
sometimes-wild, sometimes-tedious full day of jury selection in Beverly Hills 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Her attire was deliberately sedate: a black Donna Karan dress with a pearl 
necklace, pearl earrings and a red silk-flower corsage. Nowhere was the black 
hat that she had talked of wearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the (prospective) jury was very charming, every one of them," Gabor 
said, smiling for a horde of reporters and downplaying the difficulty of the 
ordeal with the quip, "I'm still alive." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born actress, renowned for her volatile temper, faces misdemeanor 
charges of driving with an expired license, disobeying a police officer and 
slapping an officer, stemming from a June 14 altercation with Beverly Hills 
Motorcycle Officer Paul Kramer, who had pulled over her custom-built Rolls for 
expired registration tags. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gabor is charged with possessing an open container of alcohol -- a 
legal infraction -- for a flask of Jack Daniels that police allegedly found in 
her glove compartment. Altogether, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 18 
months in jail and $3,400 in fines upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
A gag order on the proceedings was imposed Monday by Judge Charles G. Rubin, 
who dismissed one charge of driving with expired tags after the actress 
produced proof of registration. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney William Graysen, who is defending Gabor in a trial that could last up 
to two weeks, is expected to argue that Kramer has shown a pattern of verbally 
and physically abusing the public. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney claimed that he has found at least eight witnesses who say they 
were abused by Kramer, a 13-year veteran officer, including one land developer 
who was allegedly manhandled outside a department store in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Kramer . . . seriously beat him up, put him down on the ground and was 
pummeling him," Graysen said in an interview before the trial began. "I am 
definitely attacking Officer Kramer's character and conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis, when asked about the allegations about 
Kramer, said, "We would hope that this particular case would be judged on its 
own merit." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis described Kramer as "a good officer, very hard working.' The lieutenant 
also said of Kramer: 
</P>
<P>
"He can be a tough guy, but he certainly doesn't have a reputation for going 
out of his way to be physically tough on people. I'd say incidents like this 
would be very rare." 
</P>
<P>
The burden of proof will come later, however. Monday was a day devoted almost 
entirely to pulling up the curtain on the much-ballyhooed drama, an event that 
may have attracted more news media coverage than the trial of Night Stalker 
suspect Richard Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than a dozen TV news cameras and perhaps 50 working journalists 
descended upon Gabor as she took the elevator to Rubin's third-floor courtroom. 
So pronounced was the jostling that Gabor even found comfort in seeing a 
uniformed officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, thank God, a Beverly Hills cop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm a sheriff's deputy," he corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, he's gorgeous," Gabor shrugged. "They're all gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
The jam-packed elevator ride included a brusque word or two from Gabor aimed at 
Joelle Nelson, 31, of Houston, who had won a contest to fly to Los Angeles for 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a "Free Zsa Zsa" button, Nelson arrived as the guest of a Houston 
radio station, whose weeklong contest called for listeners to phone in every 
time they heard a short tape of Gabor in an interview saying, "She's a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
After the elevator ride, however -- a trip in which Nelson couldn't get her 
purse out of Gabor's way -- the lucky tourist was ready to take off the 
supportive Gabor button. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very rude," Nelson said later. "We came in (to town) on Saturday . . . 
saw Venice, Bel- Air -- saw Zsa Zsa's house. Now I wish I had a big rock." 
</P>
<P>
With the courtroom packed, crowds of reporters spilled into the hall, and every 
living creature became a potential interview. At one point, two of Gabor's 
hairdressers -- Sidney Guilaroff and Michael Disney -- left the courtroom for 
the elevator, drawing a crush of cameras and bodies that resembled that of a 
Watergate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael, are you planning anything special if she's convicted?" someone 
hollered at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
His answer was inaudible -- but his hair was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, meanwhile, Graysen was asking would-be jurors -- 18 of them -- 
questions exploring the gamut of human attitudes: Do you think a policeman 
should be able to cover up his misconduct by arresting a person? Should a 
smaller, weaker person have the same rights of self-defense as a larger, 
stronger person? Does anybody here have any bumper stickers? 
</P>
<P>
("No," one prospective juror answered, "just Triple-A.") 
</P>
<P>
At one point, as Graysen quizzed an engineer on the accuracy tolerances of 
designing spacecraft, Gabor's husband appeared about to doze off. But he roused 
himself, grinning, and exchanged nods with Gabor as she fanned herself with the 
back of a legal pad. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection will continue today.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLOUD-SEEDING PUT BACK ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum plans to ask the Board of Supervisors today to 
consider reviving cloud-seeding in Los Angeles County, more than a decade since 
the rainmaking program was discontinued after complaints that it caused 
devastating mudslides in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is essential that every feasible measure to increase our precious 
water supplies must be thoroughly examined," Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials do not see an immediate danger of a water shortage. But Jay 
Malinowski, spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, said: "If we have a dry winter, there could be serious problems 
next summer." 
</P>
<P>
Cloud-seeding was carried out over the San Gabriel Mountains throughout the 
1960s and most of the '70s, but the county halted the program in 1978 after 
numerous lawsuits were filed, claiming that the seeding intensified a major 
storm that killed 11 people and caused $43 million in property damage from 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
The county prevailed in each of the damage suits.

NEW INDICTMENT EXPECTED SOON IN SILBERMAN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new indictment in the complex money-laundering case involving prominent San 
Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and two 
others is due soon, prosecutors told a federal judge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. also told Judge J. Lawrence Irving 
that prosecutors expect to try the case under the new charges without calling a 
key informant, Robert Benjamin of Los Angeles, as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin was a longtime friend of Petti who acted as a go-between among Petti, 
Silberman and an undercover FBI agent during the government's money-laundering 
"sting" operation, according to an affidavit prosecutors have filed in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The current indictment charges the four men with laundering $300,000 an 
undercover FBI agent had portrayed as profits from Colombian cocaine 
trafficking. Named in those charges, along with Silberman and Petti, are Darryl 
Nakatsuka and Jack Norman Myers, both of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The new indictment is expected within a month, Gorder said at Monday's hearing, 
a "status conference" at which lawyers and judges usually tend only to 
housekeeping details. Gorder did not provide further details about the new -- 
or "superseding" -- indictment. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing that prosecutors expect to bring new charges, Irving ordered that 
a Nov. 14 hearing, at which lawyers had expected to argue motions, be converted 
to another status conference. The judge has not yet changed the Jan. 16 trial 
date, but he said it appeared likely he would have to alter it after the new 
indictment is filed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder also disclosed at the hearing that he does not plan to use Benjamin as a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was a tactical one, Gorder said, since defense lawyers were asking 
for "all kinds of stuff" about Benjamin's background "and I was saying they 
weren't entitled to it because he was not on my list of witnesses," Gorder said 
Monday after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present intention is to present other witnesses besides Mr. Benjamin, 
including the wiretapped conversations," Gorder said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit filed by prosecutors in the case suggests that evidence against 
Silberman ranges from the wiretapping of more than a dozen telephones to 
videotapes of cash transfers and the negotiating sessions preceding Silberman's 
arrest in April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Against Benjamin 
</P>
<P>
The same document explains Benjamin's alleged role in the case. Last year, 
after Silberman allegedly proposed a laundering scheme to Petti, Petti set up a 
meeting with Benjamin, a longtime acquaintance and convicted felon who became a 
cooperating witness for the FBI in 1986, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Petti arranged for Silberman to meet another contact last November, 
according to the affidavit, which was filed to support search warrants for 
Silberman's downtown San Diego office and two Los Angeles County offices. That 
contact was in fact an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
Another tactical consideration may have been at work in prosecutors' decision 
not to include Benjamin on their witness list. Sparked by Benjamin's testimony 
at Petti's probation revocation hearing in May, defense lawyers were known to 
be eager to cross-examine Benjamin at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
At the May hearing, Benjamin was at times admittedly confused and rambling 
during a cross-examination by Petti's attorney, Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas. 
Asked after that hearing about his opinion of Benjamin as a witness, Goodman 
reportedly said, "You see -- I'm smiling." 
</P>
<P>
All of the defendants have pleaded not guilty in the case. All but Petti, whose 
probation was revoked at the May hearing, remain free on bail pending the 
outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The current indictment names all four men on two counts of laundering funds 
described as proceeds from narcotics sales and on one count of conspiring to 
launder money and avoid federal laws requiring the reporting of financial 
transactions involving cash of $10,000 of more.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISOR HAHN SENT TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who has been weakened by a 
series of ailments in the last two years, was admitted Monday to Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital for treatment of an upper respiratory infection. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Sakamoto, a spokeswoman for the 68-year-old Hahn -- the county's 
longest-serving supervisor -- said the latest illness was initially thought to 
be a cold. But when the supervisor "failed to respond satisfactorily to 
out-patient treatment," doctors decided to admit him to the hospital. Sakamoto 
described the move as a "precautionary measure." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokeswoman Mary Schnack said the ailment was diagnosed as an upper 
respiratory infection. Hahn, who will miss Tuesday's Board of Supervisors 
meeting, is expected to be released in a "couple days." 
</P>
<P>
He was listed in fair condition, Schnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, who was first elected in 1952 and is serving an unprecedented 10th term, 
received radiation treatment last year for cancer discovered in his prostate. 
In 1987, he suffered a major stroke that left him partly paralyzed.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HARRY REEMS GUILTY OF U.S. TAX CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The star of "Deep Throat" and hundreds of other X-rated movies pleaded guilty 
in Los Angeles on Monday to failing to file his 1982 federal tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Streicher, who is better known by his stage name Harry Reems, was 
indicted in June on charges he did not file income tax returns for 1982, 1984 
and 1985. The 1984 and 1985 charges were dropped in exchange for his guilty 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
Streicher, 42, faces a maximum prison term of one year and a $25,000 fine when 
he is sentenced Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The former sex film star acknowledged not reporting more than $80,000 income 
from his appearance in such films as "Society Affairs" and "Sometimes Sweet 
Susan" to Harry Reems Productions, and transferring $33,000 of that income to 
his personal account, also without reporting it to the Internal Revenue 
Service.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BREAKUP MAY HAVE TRIGGERED SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute over the breakup of a relationship apparently triggered a shooting in 
which a North Hollywood woman and her mother were killed in front of three 
children, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kimberly Vandenberg, 25, and her mother, Elizabeth Vandenberg, 46, 
were fatally shot at the mother's home in the 11100 block of Acama Street about 
5 p.m. Sunday. The man Kimberly had been living with, Luis Palacio, 34, was 
later arrested in Hawthorne and is being held without bail on suspicion of 
murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio was suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest and police believe he 
was shot during a struggle with the Vandenbergs. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Coffey said the incident in the home was witnessed by Kimberly 
Vandenberg's two children, a 4-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy, who is 
Palacio's son; and by Elizabeth Vandenberg's other daughter, Kimberly's 
12-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
The children have been taken into custody by the Division of Youth Services 
until authorities can place them with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They were scared to death," Coffey said of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said Palacio and Kimberly Vandenberg lived together in North Hollywood 
but were in the process of breaking up.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE WON'T MOVE TOSHIMA MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder trial of the man charged in the Westwood slaying of Karen Toshima 
began Monday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Albracht denying a 
defense bid to move the trial somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing newspaper clipings and videotaped accounts of television 
coverage, Albracht, who is presiding over the case in Santa Monica, ruled 
against the defense request for a change of venue, calling news coverage of the 
case "most routine." The coverage should not prevent court from finding an 
unbiased jury, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is "nothing unique about this case," Albracht said, citing other 
high-profile cases that have been tried in Los Angeles County, including the 
Night Stalker and Charles Manson murder trials. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Takakjian, attorney for defendant Durrell D. Collins, 23, had argued that 
publicity surrounding this case was so great, long-lasting and divisive -- 
pitting South-Central Los Angeles residents against the rest of the city -- 
that jurors might feel compelled to convict Collins to "smooth over" the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony is expected to begin this week.

To help deal with the growing problem of homeless children, the Los Angeles 
Board of Education on Monday unanimously approved a $70,000 pilot program to 
help students from homeless families succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
With funds provided by the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the Homeless, a 
private nonprofit agency, the Coeur D'Alene Elementary School in Venice will 
offer homeless students additional counseling, social services and 
individualized instruction. Their parents will be given training to teach them 
how to help their children with schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 280 students Coeur D'Alene expects to enroll this fall, as many as 
one-third will come from homeless families in nearby shelters, according to 
Principal Beth Ojena. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they have no firm figures on the number of homeless 
children throughout the district, but the Greater Los Angeles Partnership 
estimates that there are at least 10,000 in the area, most of whom are not 
attending school regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones that are (attending school) have special needs," said Susan Imai, 
housing director of the Partnership. "They are traumatized. They are not used 
to having a stable environment." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ojena said, many of the children tend to be overly aggressive and 
argumentative. They fight with other children and generally have more problems 
adjusting to school routines. In addition, because they attend school 
irregularly, the majority of the homeless students are two to three grade 
levels behind their peers, she added. Because many families move frequently 
from shelter to shelter, some students leave and re-enter school three or four 
times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will enable the school to provide extra nursing and psychological 
services, as well as to hire a special counselor who will work primarily with 
parents to help them obtain social services. The program will also feature 
computer-assisted instruction in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
Imai said the Partnership hopes the Coeur D'Alene program will become a model 
for other schools that serve homeless children. The need for such programs is 
great because families are the fastest growing segment of the homeless 
population, she said, making up 28% of the homeless in the greater Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member board later voted 5 to 2 to approve the concept of "agency 
fees" for non-union teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The action means an election this fall among the district's 32,000 credentialed 
employees, which include teachers, counselors and librarians, to decide the fee 
issue. A majority of the credentialed employees must approve the fees before 
they can be collected. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said the fees are aimed at preventing non-members from enjoying 
all the benefits of union representation without paying for them. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 of the district's teachers, librarians and counselors are not 
union members. 
</P>
<P>
The fees would amount to about $350 a year per teacher, or 90% of full 
membership dues. Non-union teachers have objected to the fees on the grounds 
that they would lead to involuntary union membership. Some also say they fear 
the fees would be used to support political objectives with which they 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
A recent state Supreme Court ruling, however, barred teachers unions from using 
the fees over teachers' objections for political activities. UTLA officials 
said the fees will only be used to pay for the cost of negotiations and other 
services.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEMOCRATS WANT TOO MUCH FOR CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau said Monday that it has decided 
to take the the city out of the running to host the 1992 Democratic National 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau pulled out, after the Democratic National Committee required that 
the host of its quadrennial bash put up $15 million in goods and services for 
the pleasure of the only occasionally successful political party. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mayor Tom Bradley, who fought unsuccessfully for the 1976 Democratic 
convention, found the amount to be too much. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor does concur in the (bureau's) decision," Bradley spokesman Bill 
Chandler said. He described the financial tab as "rather excessive." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' withdrawal leaves 16 cities in the running for the convention, 
including San Francisco and San Diego. San Francisco was the site of the 1984 
Democratic convention.

A Soviet spokesman on Monday condemned remarks by Vice President Dan Quayle, 
who suggested that Washington might react if Moscow attempted to block 
independence movements in the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news briefing that 
Quayle's remarks Saturday amounted to interference in internal Soviet affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The least one can say about them is that they were strange," Gerasimov said. 
"They struck a discordant note against the present constructive process of 
dialogue with the United States. They were a departure from common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said in an interview on CNN television that Washington might respond if 
Moscow refused to restore independence to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which 
were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, clearly every event triggers a response," Quayle said. "And if there's a 
negative event toward the Baltic states, I would imagine there would be a 
negative response."

PROTECTING THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial misses the point when it comes to sorely needed protection for 
the California desert. Your emphasis is on the need for compromise, rather than 
the need to protect the desert. The issue is not how many acres to take out of 
the legislation, but how best to protect the remaining pristine desert lands. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that the proponents of the bill have been reluctant to make any 
concessions is patently false. In fact, about 88,000 acres of concessions have 
been made so far -- based on rational negotiations of substantive conflicts. 
All of these changes have been initiated by conservationists, not by the 
anti-wilderness forces. 
</P>
<P>
It is the conservationists who have been willing to come to the table. The 
off-road vehicle users and miners, with their typical knee-jerk anti-wilderness 
attitudes, have for the most part been unwilling to talk any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
So the ones stalling the whole process of desert protection are not the 
conservationists. It is Sen. Pete Wilson, who has refused for three years to 
say where he stands, and the House members who seem blind to the fact that 
Californians demand more protection for their desert.

This is in response to Bruce Barnbaum's comments Aug. 28 (letter). He says, 
"(Sen. Pete) Wilson has blocked every attempt to create wilderness, national 
parklands, or any other viable protection of our besieged desert lands." 
Perhaps Barnbaum confuses the raising of legitimate questions over bad 
legislation with blocking. 
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Sen. Alan Cranston (Cycle News, July 13, 1988), Wilson 
expressed these concerns and indicated a willingness to work with desert 
protection bill proponents to correct its faults. Wilson's questioning of this 
bill was an act of political courage as it incurred the displeasure of the 
Sierra Club in an election year. Happily, he was reelected. 
</P>
<P>
As The Times said in an editorial ("Desert Dilemma," Aug. 27), both sides 
should increase their efforts in search of some common ground.

BOARD BANS 'CATCHER IN THE RYE' FROM HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boron High School students will not be studying "The Catcher in the Rye" this 
year because of a recent school board decision to remove the critically 
acclaimed novel from the school reading list after some parents said its 
content was unsuitable for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
But later this month, students in Shelley Keller-Gage's English class will read 
"Fahrenheit 451," Ray Bradbury's novel about a future in which government has 
banned individual thinking, television dominates society and firemen burn 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Keller-Gage said Monday that the presence of "Fahrenheit 451" in her curriculum 
is not intended as retaliation at the Muroc Joint Unified School District board 
for banning the study of "The Catcher in the Rye," J.D. Salinger's 1951 novel 
about the adolescent crisis of Holden Caulfield. The district serves about 
3,000 students who live in and around Boron, a desert town in the northeastern 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I taught 'Fahrenheit 451' last fall," Keller-Gage said. "I'm not doing it in 
relation to the school board decision. It is an ironic coincidence, you might 
say." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents' Campaign 
</P>
<P>
In May, a group of parents mounted a campaign against "The Catcher in the Rye" 
when Keller-Gage was teaching it to freshmen and sophomores, although the book 
had been taught for several years without incident. Opponents criticized the 
book's profanity, saying the novel was blasphemous and promoted anti-family 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the school board voted 4-1 to remove Salinger's novel from a 
70-book reading list for high school students. However, the book remains in 
both the school and local libraries, where it has gained more readers because 
of the controversy, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher's quiet and passionate defense of "The Catcher in the Rye" has made 
Keller-Gage, a 35-year-old Boron native, the subject of newspaper and 
television profiles focusing on a nationwide rise in efforts to ban books in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous step," she said of the ban. "It's a few townspeople telling 
us how to teach our kids. It isn't something I asked for, but it is a cause 
that I believe in and I do believe there has been an injustice done." 
</P>
<P>
Keller-Gage, who gave students the option of studying alternate books if their 
parents objected to the Salinger novel, said the board has suppressed a widely 
taught literary classic. The book is known for the funny, poignant and 
foul-mouthed narration of Caulfield, a troubled preparatory-school student from 
New York who has become a quintessential antihero of American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Keller-Gage said the chronicle of Caulfield's adolescent odyssey drew special 
interest from her teen-age students, including some who shun books regardless 
of their content. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, school board President Jim Summers said he reread the book 
recently and was not impressed. "I had a hard time staying with it," he said. 
"I don't know who considers it a literary classic." 
</P>
<P>
And he said the board decision has drawn far less interest from district 
residents than from outsiders and the media. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Restricted It' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider this a ban," said Summers, who owns a local service station 
and spoke highly of Keller-Gage as a teacher. "We restricted it, that's true. 
But the book is in the library. More kids are going to read it now as a result 
of all this. . . . And they're going to get a fine education without that book 
on the reading list." 
</P>
<P>
Summers said he did not think the removal of the book would result in new 
efforts to exclude books from the curriculum. He said he had no problem with 
Keller-Gage's comments on the matter or her decision to teach "Fahrenheit 451." 
</P>
<P>
Summers said the action was justified because of complaints from at least 20 
parents. Keller-Gage said the parents of about 10 out of approximately 150 
English students complained initially, and said opponents of the book declined 
her request to discuss the book at subsequent parent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Local resident and religious activist Patty Salazar said she supports the board 
action because the novel "doesn't belong in a public high school." 
</P>
<P>
"It uses the Lord's name in vain 200 times," she said. "That's enough reason to 
ban it right there. They say it describes reality. I say let's back up from 
reality. Let's go backwards. Let's go back to when we didn't have an immoral 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The novel's profanity and sexual references drew scandalized reactions in the 
1950s but the criticism faded as literature and movies of the 1960s and 1970s 
made it seem tame in comparison, according to The Dictionary of Literary 
Biography. The dictionary said the novel is considered a prominent work of 
post-World War II American fiction. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, "The Catcher in the Rye" ranks along with works such as 
Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" and John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" among the 
books most frequently challenged in schools and libraries on religious or moral 
grounds, according a report last year by PEN, an international writers 
organization. PEN and other watchdog groups have warned that such censorship is 
on the rise and represents a threat to constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar and other opponents of the book said they had not and would not read 
it. Boron High School senior Nathan Cathcart criticized that as a "ridiculous" 
mentality leading to a "dumb mistake" by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Questions 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart, 17, described himself as an avid reader and a fan of "The Catcher in 
the Rye," which he studied at the school as a freshman. He pointed out that 
questions about the book will appear on national exams for the advanced 
placement English class he is taking. 
</P>
<P>
"Educated people have looked at this book and recognized that it has literary 
merit," he said. "Other books make reference to Holden Caulfield. . . . The 
students don't realize the greatness of this issue. It could start as something 
small and work its way up." 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart said the school board has taken away the rights of children to study 
the book with assistance from teachers and the rights of parents to decide 
whether they want their children to study it, since the teacher had given them 
a choice. 
</P>
<P>
As to the potentially detrimental effect on teen-agers of profanity and sexual 
references, he said: "At that age, they know the words. In junior high, in 
fourth and fifth grade they know the words, and they say them to impress each 
other. When I walk down the hall I hear kids in junior high say more cuss words 
in a minute than I say in an entire day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart and Keller-Gage said they hope the school board might still reconsider 
its decision, but Summers said there are no plans to do so because there has 
been little opposition in the community. 
</P>
<P>
While Keller-Gage says she has received support from students, teachers and 
strangers who have written her letters, she said she has not yet discussed the 
issue in class. She said she may allude to it when her classes begin studying 
the themes of censorship and governmental control in "Fahrenheit 451" later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Some elements of the grim future depicted in "Fahrenheit 451" have come true, 
Keller-Gage said. She cited Bradbury's portrait of "lack of communication in 
families, devotion to television and disregard for human life." She drew a 
parallel between the novel's scenes depicting drivers who run down people for 
sport and the real-life random cruelty of drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the success of campaigns against "The Catcher in the Rye" and 
other books also reflect fulfillment of Bradbury's prophecy, she said: "I hope 
not. It's possible. The censorship does come out of a desire to protect our 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't feel it is the right way to do that."

WOMAN DIES AFTER CAR RUNS OFF I-5, IS HIT BY TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A La Mesa woman was killed in a freak accident Monday when her car veered off 
southbound Interstate 5 near San Onofre and landed on railroad tracks, where it 
was demolished moments later by an Amtrak commuter train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 150 passengers was injured on the train, which had slowed in an 
effort to avoid the collision, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Gary Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Gina Delpozo, 25, of La Mesa by a San Diego County 
deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
A San Onofre State Park employee who had been eating lunch in a nearby building 
climbed a fence and dashed to the tracks in a vain attempt to rescue Delpozo 
just before the 2:20 p.m. collision about 5 miles south of San Clemente, Smith 
said. The employee, identified as Nuuuli Segi, was about 50 feet away when the 
car was hit by the train, estimated to have been traveling at 45 to 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Park Ranger Cindi Bates, 32, as well as two state beach lifeguards and an 
off-duty paramedic traveling on the train tried unsuccessfully to revive 
Delpozo, who was pinned inside the vehicle. She died at the scene, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The train was delayed about 90 minutes. Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd 
identified the train as No. 576, which had left Los Angeles at 12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Delpozo's car was southbound about a mile south of Basilone Road 
when it left the roadway and tore through 150 feet of brush, some of it dense, 
and a four-strand barbed-wire fence, then soared off an embankment about 15 
feet into the air. The vehicle landed right-side up, straddling the tracks that 
parallel the freeway on the west. 
</P>
<P>
Segi scaled a 6-foot chain-link fence and ran up an embankment just as the 
train hit the vehicle, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was en route to the vehicle when it was struck by the train," Smith said. 
"Needless to say, he was a bit shook up." 
</P>
<P>
There is a gentle curve at the spot where the car left the freeway, but, Smith 
said, "we don't have any idea why she ran off the road. 
</P>
<P>
"The coroner will do a blood analysis. We have no witnesses as to her driving 
before going off the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the accident was a freak occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult to do this on purpose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bates and others at the scene tried to revive Delpozo until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"We removed her from the vehicle and laid her flat on her back a few feet from 
the car and started with oxygen and suction to remove the blood from her 
airway," said Bates, 32, of San Clemente. "We continued with oxygen and suction 
and were able to maintain an airway with her until the paramedics arrived." 
</P>
<P>
"One of my co-workers . . . said (the victim) wiped out about 10 feet of real 
heavy sagebrush on the bluff, knocked into a guardrail and a chain-link fence 
and still had enough momentum to become airborne over the bluff and land on the 
track," Bates said. "That's moving." 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak engineer was riding in a cab at the front of the train as it 
approached the vehicle, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"The engineer sits very exposed in the back of the car and the locomotive is . 
. . pushing it," he said. "As soon as he saw the vehicle stopped on the tracks, 
he threw on the emergency brake and ran toward the rear of the car to avoid the 
collision." 
</P>
<P>
"We figure it hit at 45 to 50 m.p.h. and pushed the car 1,028 feet down the 
tracks," Smith said. Train speeds of up to 90 m.p.h. are permissible along that 
stretch of coast because there are no grade-level crossings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, he was shook up," Smith said of the engineer, "but he's 
physically fine. There were no injuries to anybody on the train. There was 
extremely light damage to the train." 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly did everything he could do to avoid a collision," Smith said.

<P>
SANDBLASTING PATROLS WINNING THE BATTLE, OFFICER SAYS

<P>
Larry Carmona is a cop who cruises around the northwest San Fernando Valley in 
a black and white police van with a strobe light on top. But he's not hunting 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Carmona is a graffiti buster. Working with a crew of people sentenced to 
perform community service, Carmona uses a sandblaster to erase the ugly 
signature of urban blight. 
</P>
<P>
"Pump that one more time," he said to one of the workers last week as a white 
streak of water and sand hissed against a graffiti-stained block wall in the 
Bryant-Vanalden area of Northridge. "Get that in high gear." 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, sandblasters have become an increasingly important 
weapon in the Valley's war against graffiti. Purchased by politicians, 
community groups and chambers of commerce, at least six of the machines are 
being used in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the machines erase graffiti with ease, police and community 
activists say state law prevents them from being used to their maximum 
potential. In many cases, they say, the machines cannot be used on private 
property because the owner cannot be located to give permission. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance allowing the city 
to remove graffiti from private property and bill owners, even if they refuse 
to clean it up on their own. The ordinance is awaiting approval by Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
While praising the goal of the ordinance, some say it does not go far enough 
because the city still must track down the property owner before removing the 
graffiti. The Northridge Chamber of Commerce is pushing for a change in state 
law, which takes precedence until the city approves its ordinance, that would 
allow cities to declare graffiti-stained properties a nuisance. Once the 
property is declared a nuisance, the city could remove the graffiti after an 
unspecified waiting period even without the owner's permission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make it quicker and you're going to save the expense" of 
spending weeks on identifying landowners and contacting them, said Sandra Dack, 
executive director of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce. Some property changes 
hands rapidly and some owners live out of the county or out of state, making it 
difficult to find them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber made its proposal last month in a letter to the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments. No state legislators have offered to carry legislation 
implementing such a change, said Robert Giacobbe, the Northridge Chamber of 
Commerce president. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, graffiti-busting officers Carmona and Tom Shaw, who uses a 
sandblaster in the Police Department's West Valley Division, say the machines 
are having an effect. Both work on the project full time. 
</P>
<P>
Carmona and Shaw said community complaints about graffiti have dropped with the 
advent of the sandblasters. The officers said no figures are kept, but that 
complaints at both divisions have fallen from about 100 a week to about 50. 
</P>
<P>
The West Valley Division sandblaster was christened in July, 1988. The 
Devonshire Division machine used by Carmona has been in use for six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We are winning the battle," Shaw said. "Sometimes we have to go back as many 
as three times to a location, but normally after the third time it stays 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
The persistence of graffiti artists is evident on Carmona's beat. At 
Bryant-Vanalden, he and his crew wiped out some spray-painted initials from a 
building entrance, leaving behind the sandblaster's characteristic whitish 
residue. As Carmona drove away, he passed another building entrance with the 
same initials sprayed above a white patch left by the sandblaster. Carmona and 
company had been there several days before. 
</P>
<P>
The Devonshire Division sandblaster was bought for $4,600 by City Councilman 
Hal Bernson with funds from his office's expense budget. Carmona is awaiting 
delivery of a second machine that Bernson is donating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Businesses Donate 
</P>
<P>
The machine used in the West Valley Division was bought with funds donated by 
business groups in Canoga Park, Reseda and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Other machines are in use in North Hollywood, Van Nuys and Sylmar, where a 
group called the Sylmar Graffiti-Busters pioneered the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, a recently formed West Valley group calling itself the Neighborhood 
Beautification Program plans to use its new sandblaster for the first time, 
selecting the alley behind a supermarket in West Hills. Homeowner groups, 
chambers of commerce and individual businesses from West Hills, Woodland Hills 
and Tarzana bought the machine, said Rick Najar of West Hills, an organizer of 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a miraculous difference," Najar said of the presence of the machines 
across the Valley. One of his group's goals, Najar said, is to persuade 
apartment managers, homeowners and others that graffiti should be removed 
immediately after it appears. 
</P>
<P>
"You take it off twice, maybe three times, and it's gone," he said. "If enough 
people catch on to this fact and use the machines, we'll keep on pushing."

TRIAL SET FOR MAN IN ATTACK ON ESCAPEE WHO FAILED TO PAY FOR GETAWAY RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On May 14, a North Hollywood man scaled two 12-foot-high barbed-wire fences and 
escaped from a minimum-security San Bernardino County jail where he was serving 
a one-year sentence for possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been better off staying put. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Prince's taste of freedom ended less than 24 hours later when he 
collapsed at the front door of the Los Angeles Police Department's North 
Hollywood Station. He had been shot twice by a member of the notorious Crips 
gang after unwittingly recruiting a carload of gang members to drive him from 
San Bernardino to the San Fernando Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray Johnson, 25, who police say is a member of the Hoover Street Crips, 
was ordered Monday to stand trial in San Fernando Municipal Court on charges 
that he attempted to murder Prince, 32, after the fugitive failed to pay for 
the ride. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, Prince -- who has served time in state prison 
for robbery, arson and burglary -- said he escaped from San Bernardino's Glen 
Helen Rehabilitation Center and wanted to get to his home in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said he approached Johnson, who was standing in front of his parents' 
house, and asked him for a ride, explaining his plight. The defendant agreed to 
help in exchange for money, Prince testified. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson found another member of the Hoover Street Crips with a car and the men 
agreed to make the trip from San Bernardino, Prince testified. Two other men, 
who police believe were also Crips, accompanied them. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said he realized his benefactors were gang members during the ride, 
which lasted more than an hour. Fearing trouble when they learned he had no 
money, Prince testified, he asked the men to drop him off at an apartment 
building across the street from the North Hollywood Police Station. He said he 
told them he had a friend who would give him money. 
</P>
<P>
"I told 'em I'd get them some money for the ride and they wanted to accompany 
me," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said that when he told Johnson he did not want Johnson to follow him to 
his friend's apartment, Johnson became angry and fired a .38-caliber revolver 
at the ground. The two began struggling and Johnson shot him in the stomach, 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
As he lay on the ground, Prince testified, Johnson fired the revolver at his 
head but Prince threw his hands up and the bullet pierced his forearm. His 
assailants fled. 
</P>
<P>
Prince testified that he was afraid he would bleed to death or that the gang 
members would return and kill him, so he fled back to the arms of the law -- 
the nearby police station -- where he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
He remained conscious long enough to describe the car, which authorities traced 
to Johnson, and David Engleton, 21, of San Bernardino. A preliminary hearing 
for Engleton will be held today in San Fernando Municipal Court. Authorities 
said a third suspect, Keith Slaughter, 21, is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Prince, after recovering from the two wounds, pleaded guilty to leaving a 
correctional facility without permission, a felony, and was sentenced to three 
years in state prison.

TALE OF 2 BUREAUCRACIES: 1 BOTTLENECK, COMING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commuters who travel the Olsen-Madera Road corridor, which connects California 
118 and 23, may have been wondering lately why there is a bottleneck on the 
border of Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, where a road-widening project appears 
to have stopped prematurely. The answer lies in municipal bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks recently completed a road-widening project that took 18 months to 
finish and cost $2.7 million, according to that city's traffic engineer, Jano 
Bagdanian. Thus, in Thousand Oaks, Olsen Road is a four-lane divided highway 
that smoothly flows to and from California 23. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, however, where Olsen becomes Madera Road, an estimated 600-foot 
stretch of Madera annoyingly narrows on the westbound side from two lanes to 
one near the Thousand Oaks border -- causing a rush-hour bottleneck. Traffic 
Engineer Bill Golubics says that's because the developers of Wood Ranch, a 
large residential project on the south side of Madera Road, are responsible for 
the improvement but aren't scheduled to begin work until next year. Plans call 
for the road to eventually be four lanes, two in each direction, as in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working with them to expedite the process," Golubics said of the private 
developers. "It would've been nice to get four lanes in place at the same time" 
as Thousand Oaks' recently completed project, "but it just didn't work out that 
way." 
</P>

COUNCIL'S OK EXPECTED ON ON PLANS FOR BURBANK MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council, after years of struggling to attract a major shopping 
mall to its downtown redevelopment area, is expected tonight to give partial 
approval to plans for a $250-million retail-office complex on a 41-acre 
downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
After a public hearing, the council will vote at its regular meeting tonight on 
a developer's application for a permit to build the proposed Burbank Gateway 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member panel will vote on the second part of the agreement, which 
covers the city's land lease with mall developer Alexander Haagen, at its 
meeting on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Monday that they are satisfied with the proposal and 
predicted that plans for the shopping center would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Move' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any problems," City Manager Robert Ovrom said. "This is a 
solid project that is going to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Hastings agreed, calling the mall "a positive move for the 
city. We promised the people a retail center in Burbank, and hopefully, without 
any snags, we'll deliver it." 
</P>
<P>
The Haagen development calls for an enclosed three-level shopping mall with 
four office towers and a hotel. The buildings range from nine to 16 stories and 
will be built on a site near the Civic Center. The shopping mall will be 
anchored by the Ikea furniture store and Mervyn's and Sears department stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to project studies, the shopping mall will create 7,900 jobs and 
generate an estimated $8.4 million in annual revenues for Burbank. But Fred 
Bruning, chief of staff for the Haagen firm, said the mall will provide even 
greater benefits for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're helping to create a nucleus for a new downtown Burbank," Bruning 
said. "This will provide downtown Burbank a chance to get on the map and 
provide a focus that will be meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
The city has tried unsuccessfully for almost 20 years to develop a mall on the 
site at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway. But 
projects proposed by several developers, including the Walt Disney Co., fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Bruning said he is confident that his company's project will be able to proceed 
as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate any problems," he said. "We've worked closely with the 
city staff for the last eight months. We have no reason to think that approval 
is not forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
Bruning said ground-breaking on the project is tentatively set for early 
October. 
</P>
<P>
The free-standing two-story Ikea store and an adjoining parking building will 
be the first structures built, with completion set for October, 1990, Bruning 
said. Construction on the retail mall, which would include Mervyn's and Sears, 
would not start until early next year, he said.

NAACP WEIGHS STATE, U.S. HELP IN VANDALISM PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County chapter of the NAACP on Monday said it would ask for state 
and federal intervention if investigators do not make arrests within one month 
in the racial vandalism of a black family's home in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter President John R. Hatcher said he would ask for action by the U.S. and 
California attorney generals if the Simi Valley Police Department and the FBI, 
which are now investigating the incident, do not locate suspects in the August 
attack on the home of the Louis Boss family. 
</P>
<P>
The family discovered the damage Aug. 14 when they returned from a four-day 
cross-country trip. No arrests have been made in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to play it off as a prank by a bunch of kids," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 people attended the regular monthly meeting of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People at True Spirit Community Church in Simi 
Valley, the highest attendance in several months. Members attributed the 
turnout to concern over the Boss case. 
</P>
<P>
A five-member committee was formed to meet with the family of Boss, a 
Northridge Junior High School teacher, and ask what they need to repair their 
home, which was heavily vandalized and defaced by racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher complained that the attack on the Boss family was only the latest in a 
series of racially motivated crimes throughout Ventura County in the last two 
years. Hatcher said he also believes there is a pattern of job discrimination 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those attending the meeting Monday night recounted incidents in which 
they said they were the victims of racially oriented discrimination or 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hatcher cited the vandalism as an example of racial hatred in Simi 
Valley, the incident has evoked an outpouring of community support for the Boss 
family. Neighbors and others have offered to help the family repair the house; 
the Rotary and Kiwanis have contributed $2,500 toward a reward for information 
leading to an arrest, and the Simi Valley Unified School District last week 
began discussing whether to increase attention to race relations in its 
curriculum.

PAIR'S BREAKUP TO BLAME IN FATAL SHOOTING AUTHORITIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A dispute over the breakup of a relationship apparently provoked a shooting in 
which a North Hollywood woman and her mother were killed during a struggle in 
front of three children, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kimberly Vandenberg, 25, and her mother, Elizabeth Vandenberg, 46, 
were shot to death in the mother's house in the 11100 block of Acama Street 
about 5 p.m. Sunday. Luis Palacio, 34, with whom Kimberly Vandenberg had been 
living, was arrested in Hawthorne and was being held without bail on suspicion 
of murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio had been shot in the chest before he was captured and police believe 
that he was wounded during a struggle with the Vandenbergs. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Coffey said the shootings were partially witnessed by Kimberly 
Vandenberg's two children, a 4-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy who is 
Palacio's son. They also were seen by Kimberly's 12-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children in Custody 
</P>
<P>
The children have been taken into custody by the Division of Youth Services 
until authorities can place them with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They were scared to death," Coffey said of the children. When the shooting 
started, "They hid in the kitchen. They were still in there when the police 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said Palacio and Kimberly Vandenberg lived together in North Hollywood 
but were in the process of breaking up. Vandenberg had taken her children to 
her mother's house for a visit Sunday, and a dispute began after Palacio 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a slight discussion, not even a heated argument as far as we can tell," 
Coffey said. Palacio took out a gun and the shooting began, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio fled in Kimberly Vandenberg's car after the shooting. Coffey said 
Palacio went to the house of a friend in Hawthorne and said he had been shot 
and needed help. The friend called police and Palacio left. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorme police learned of the North Hollywood slayings and received a 
description of Kimberly Vandenberg's car. Palacio was arrested at 7:30 p.m. 
when a Hawthorne officer found him in a telephone booth after seeing Kimberly 
Vandenberg's car parked at Rosecrans and Ramona avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said that Palacio was in good condition with a serious but not 
life-threatening chest wound and that he was being treated at an undisclosed 
hospital. Palacio was expected to be transferred later this week to the jail 
ward of Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.

The fire started about 8:10 p.m. in a house in the 2200 block of Burnside 
Street and was contained at 9:13 p.m., said Fire Department dispatcher Cece 
Grives. A fire captain and a firefighter were treated at Simi Valley Adventist

CHARGERS WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER OPENING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday was the day the Chargers were supposed to open the regular season. They 
instead opened Pandora's Box. 
</P>
<P>
Their offense was soft. Their defense was flat. Their special teams were 
thoroughly askew. And their post-game explanations were crooked after the 
Raiders stabbed the heart of a franchise full of hope with a 40-14 victory at 
the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers punctured their own credibility when their coach, Dan Henning, and 
their starting quarterback, Jim McMahon, couldn't agree on why Henning removed 
McMahon from the game in the third period and whether or not McMahon was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In shorthand form, the depositions went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, McMahon said, he bruised his ribs late in the third quarter one play 
before Marion Butts' one-yard touchdown run cut the Raider lead to 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, he said, he didn't ask to leave the game before the Chargers' next 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, he said, he was told he would be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, backup quarterback David Archer said, McMahon requested to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, Henning said, "He (McMahon) indicated to me he could go back in the 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, Henning said, the doctors did not tell him McMahon couldn't return. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, several Chargers said, we knew McMahon was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, several others said, we had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
Sounded like a Barnaby Jones rerun. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders were the ones who weren't supposed to have a clue. They had 
lost all four of their exhibitions and four of their final five regular-season 
games last year. Their starting quarterback, Jay Schroeder, suffered a 
separated left shoulder on the first offensive play of the game. And he didn't 
return after the first series, which ended with a 26-yard touchdown pass to 
wide-open running back Vance Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
The player Mueller beat was inside linebacker Jim Collins. The list of Charger 
defenders who subsequently joined Collins in an afternoon full of embarrassment 
was a long one. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played terrible," said free safety Vencie Glenn. "Lousy. Plain and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall a game where the outcome has differed so greatly from the 
expectations coming in," said Ron Lynn, the defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"I stunk the place up," said cornerback Sam Seale, beaten badly by Raider wide 
receiver Willie Gault on the 39-yard touchdown pass in the third period that 
increased the lead to 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ready enough on offense yet to combat the mistakes we made on 
defense," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
That part he had right. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ran over and around the Charger defense for 418 yards. Schroeder 
completed two of three passes for 79 yards and will probably return next week 
in Kansas City. His replacement, Steve Beuerlein, connected on 15 of 22 for 206 
yards and two touchdowns. McMahon managed just seven of 18 for 91 yards; Archer 
five of 11 for 62. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers answered the Raiders' initial touchdown midway through the first 
period with a burst off left guard by rookie running back Butts. Butts, 248 
pounds, received important blocks from right guard David Richards, starting 
center Courtney Hall and left guard Broderick Thompson before easily outrunning 
the Raider secondary. 
</P>
<P>
It was the longest Charger run for a touchdown since Lionel James raced 56 for 
a score against Cincinnati four years ago. "Basically," Butts said, "I was 
untouched." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders broke that tie 15 plays, 78 yards and 7:33 later when wide receiver 
Mervyn Fernandez found an open spot in the right corner of the end zone on 
third and two from the four. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Seale said. "He may have even been my man, too. That's how bad it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers special teams were worse. For starters, Lewis Colbert's net 
punting average after four kicks was 24.0 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Fernandez's touchdown, a poorly blocked Jamie Holland kickoff return 
backed the Chargers up to their own 11. A short Colbert punt gave the Raiders 
the ball at the Charger 49. Nine plays after that, Marcus Allen, who missed all 
of training camp in a salary dispute, dived over from the one. 
</P>
<P>
Holland also muffed the second-half kickoff, and the Chargers started at their 
own five. Colbert's 36-yard punt preceded a 29-yard return by Tim Brown that 
preceded Gault's undressing of Seale. 
</P>
<P>
"Very sporadic," Henning said when asked about his special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Before the period was over, rookie Wayne Walker would field a Raider punt at 
the six. He said the coaches told him not to return anything inside the 10. 
But, he added, "I'd do the same thing over if I had the chance. I was trying to 
make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
Four plays before that, the Chargers were caught with 12 men on the field when 
rookie Burt Grossman thought the Raiders were trying a field goal. They were 
punting. He isn't on the punt-return unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confused," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert's next punt was a 38-yarder that gave the Raiders the ball on the 
Charger 35. Only a missed field goal prevented the Raiders from increasing 
their lead to 17 points. Kicker Jeff Jaeger atoned for that miss with a 
22-yarder early in the final period following yet another short Colbert punt. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy of errors continued. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, Charger rookie Victor Floyd mishandled the ball, 
finally picked it up and retreated from the oncoming pursuit. Ex-Charger Timmie 
Ware and Stefon Adams caught up to him in the end zone for a safety that made 
the score 33-14. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to score five points on consecutive plays. But that's what 
Floyd's mistake enabled the Raiders to do. "He (Floyd) thought he was in the 
end zone when he picked up the ball," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
If that was the case, why didn't Floyd just down it? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders almost made it three consecutive scoring plays when Adams 
momentarily broke free on the subsequent free kick. His 27-yard return set up 
the Raiders at the Charger 37, from where Beuerlein directed the final scoring 
drive. Mueller's one-yard dive and Jaeger's extra point accounted for the 
game's final points. 
</P>
<P>
More than one Charger said the team will recover and learn from what happened 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But, Henning said, "I'd rather have this game somewhere other than under my 
belt."

SALE OF LOS ALAMITOS TRACK TO SACRAMENTO GROUP NOW OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood Park Realty officially announced the sale of Los Alamitos Racecourse 
to a harness-racing group from Sacramento. The group, headed by Lloyd Arnold, 
president of Cal Racing Expo Assn., paid a reported $71 million for the 297 
acres, which include a golf course and undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Arnold in the venture are Buzz Oates, one of the leading builders of 
commercial and industrial buildings in Sacramento, attorney Chris Bardis and 
developer Frank Ramos. Group members said they will continue to use the race 
track for both harness and quarter horses, but they also hope to rebuild the 
golf course and develop some of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is settled, but we hope to run 23 or 24 weeks each of both harness and 
quarter horses," Bardis said from his law office in Sacramento. "We're striving 
for parity and we're hoping that the quarter horse people will cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get cooperation, it will only become a factor for the next 10 
years of the property (which is when a quarter horse lease on the property runs 
out.)." 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation doesn't appear likely. Ed Allred, who also headed a group that 
offered to buy the track and is president of the Horseman's Quarter Horse 
Racing Assn., expects litigation before the issue is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do depends on what they say they will do for us," Allred said. "It 
could be done peaceably, but I suspect it will not be that way. Under an 
agreement with Hollywood Park, we were entitled to 30 weeks of racing and there 
is no way way we will ever accept anything less than that. We have a lot of 
options, even if that means running at another track." 
</P>
<P>
The Quarter Horse Racing Assn. has a lease with Hollywood Park that extends to 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
The Arnold group was selected because it was making a single offer for all the 
property, according to Bob Forgnone, an attorney representing Hollywood Park. 
The Allred group was putting together two separate transactions, one to his 
group for the track and a separate land transaction to Pacific Telesis. Allred 
said the combined offer with PacTel was worth $76 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Hollywood Park) board felt it was better to go for the one offer," 
Forgnone said. "It was more of a sure thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bardis said that the immediate plans are to try to make harness and 
quarter-horse racing profitable. He said there would be no major improvements 
in the physical state of the facility until that is done. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who says he intends to move to Southern California in a week, plans to 
bring horses in from the East Coast in order to improve the quality of racing. 
He also plans to step up promotions. A harness meet is planned from Nov. 25 to 
May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is expected to greatly reduce Hollywood Park's debt of nearly $100 
million. The money will transfer on Nov. 20 and escrow will close at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Forgnone said the track will now attempt to reduce the remaining debt. He said 
two options open to the track are selling off property near the Inglewood track 
making a public stock offering.

$370 GIVEN TO BRING INJURED BOY'S MOTHER FROM VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friends and teammates, aided by school administrators, raised $370 Monday in an 
effort to bring the mother of a La Quinta High School football player from 
Vietnam to the United States to see her critically injured son, possibly for 
the last time. 
</P>
<P>
Kiet Le, a 16-year-old sophomore at La Quinta, was rushed to UCI Medical Center 
in Orange Friday after he collapsed during a junior varsity football game. Kiet 
underwent brain surgery Friday night to remove a blood clot, and he has not 
regained consciousness. He was on life support systems Monday in the intensive 
care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Kiet has not seen his mother in 11 years, according to La Quinta principal 
Andrew McTaggart. Kiet has been living with his father and sister in 
Westminster. It was not known Monday why his mother could not emigrate to the 
United States with the rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We made posters and boxes and put them around the quad area at school," said 
senior Wes Kollar, a close friend and teammate of Kiet. "We wanted to do 
something for the family. People donated their lunch money and everything." 
</P>
<P>
The $370 that students raised Monday will go to the family to help pay for an 
airline ticket and other expenses for the mother, whose name was not 
immediately known, Kollar said. "We're probably going to double that tomorrow," 
he said of the amount raised. 
</P>
<P>
McTaggart, who was at the game Friday, said that Kiet took the field with the 
punt return unit, but, before play began, he staggered across the line of 
scrimmage and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have contacted U.S. government officials in an attempt to 
expedite the process by which Kiet's mother would enter the country. According 
to McTaggart, she is already on a waiting list and had been scheduled to 
emigrate in November. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to intervene through various channels to get her here now," 
McTaggart said. "It's still in channels, and we're waiting to see if we can 
clear everything up." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who was asked to assist, has made 
contact with the various agencies involved, McTaggart said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts also have been made to contact the Vietnamese mission to the United 
Nations as well as the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, McTaggart added. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Dornan has been working extensively to communicate through 
channels," McTaggart said, adding that Dornan said he has alerted the White 
House in an effort to expedite the mother's arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
Kollar said that Kiet is friendly to everyone and is always willing to lend a 
hand, both on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
"Last summer during football practice, the coach said he needed someone to play 
backup quarterback and Le volunteered," Kollar said, adding that Kiet did not 
really have the throwing skills needed to play the position. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a clue what he was doing" as quarterback, Kollar said. "After a 
couple of days, the coach finally got another guy who was better at it. Kiet 
was sure happy about that; he'd had enough." 
</P>
<P>
McTaggart met with team members Monday morning to tell them about Kiet's 
condition and about the efforts to bring his mother to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His friends on the team stayed together after the meeting. "About 10 of us, his 
closest friends, stayed through second period," Kollar said. "We said a little 
prayer and talked about the good stuff Le has done."

2 MEN CRITICALLY HURT BY OFFICERS' GUNSHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were in critical but stable condition Monday after they were shot by 
Santa Ana police officers in separate incidents Sunday night. Police said both 
men had become combative when approached by officers. 
</P>
<P>
One man, identified as Andres Cervantes, 26, was shot in the stomach after he 
apparently wrested an officer's gun away during a family brawl, Santa Ana 
police spokesman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, police responded at 8:41 p.m. to a report of a family fight 
in the street in the 100 block of East Myrtle Street, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"As two officers approached the fight, they were attacked by six family members 
without any provocation," she said. Three family members fought one officer to 
the ground and were trying to remove his gun from his holster when the other 
officer, who was fighting three other men, saw what was happening and fired one 
bullet striking Cervantes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect who was shot had been successful in removing the officer's weapon 
and was holding it in his hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes was treated by paramedics and taken to United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where he underwent surgery Sunday night. All six men in the 
fracas were arrested, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier incident, Jesse James Elizalde, 38, was shot in the arm and leg 
after he ran from two police officers who suspected him of speeding, Thomas 
said. The officers were patrolling the 1900 block of West Myrtle Street at 6:05 
p.m. when they saw his car speed up the street. 
</P>
<P>
As they tried to follow the car and stop it, Elizalde jumped out and ran to the 
front door of a house in the 500 block of South Franklin Street, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"One officer ran out and approached him. A scuffle started. The front door 
suddenly opened, and it appeared as if the officer was pulled inside the house. 
The second officer, fearing for the other officer, ran into the residence, 
heard yelling coming from the rear of the house," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
As the officer approached, Elizalde was combative and charged at him several 
times, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizalde fled out the rear of the house, followed by an officer. The suspect 
then grabbed a four-foot metal pipe and charged at the officer, who drew a 
club, Thomas said. When the suspect grabbed the officer's club and refused to 
drop it, the officer shot him from a distance of about two feet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizalde was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The names of both officers were withheld pending further investigation.

PROTESTERS TAKE ISSUE TO DEVELOPER'S DOORSTEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A small group of environmentalists, political leaders and Laguna Beach 
officials picketed the chairman of the Irvine Co. on Monday in their first 
organized demonstration against the company's plans for developing part of 
Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Irvine Co. officials have sought approval for the 2,150-acre 
Laguna Laurel Planned Community, an ambitious development project on 
unincorporated county land that would include recreational areas and a shopping 
center next to Leisure World in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A voluminous environmental impact report was released late last month, an 
indication that, with final approvals, the project could break ground by early 
next year, Irvine Co. officials said. Community hearings on the impact report 
are scheduled for next week. The matter then would go to the county Planning 
Commission and Board of Supervisors for final review. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to gain public support before a Sept. 20 public hearing to be held at El 
Morro Elementary School, about 25 protesters gathered Monday at the gated 
entrance to Linda Isle in Newport Beach, where Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren 
reportedly lives, to voice their objections to the project. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the demonstration, Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida 
Lenney said protesters wanted to picket within shouting distance of Bren's home 
because he has never personally responded to their objections. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that if we took our objections to his front yard, so to speak, 
we would know that he has gotten our message," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Capping the two-hour demonstration, the protesters lighted candles and waved 
handmade signs to motorists passing along Bayside Drive. The signs criticized 
both Bren and Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, 
proclaiming, "Greed Can't Succeed" and "Greenbelts, not Greenbacks." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled about being here," Lenney said as she passed out flyers to 
motorists entering the exclusive island community. "What you're seeing here is 
a group of dedicated people who are dying for a chance to do something to 
preserve their community. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the open space as a relief from urbanization. There is a peaceful 
feeling that you can't duplicate when you drive through (Laguna) canyon." 
</P>
<P>
An Irvine Co. official, reached before the demonstration, said Bren was aware 
that the protest was scheduled, but would be unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 3,200-home community on both sides of Laguna Canyon Road is 
bounded on the north and west by Irvine, on the east by the Leisure World, and 
the south by Laguna Beach and Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney and other community leaders said that despite assurances from Irvine Co. 
officials that more than half of the project would be preserved as open space, 
the planned community would destroy much of the beauty of the chaparral-covered 
hills surrounding Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
They said the project -- which calls for widening Laguna Canyon Road to a 
six-lane highway, a plan that has repeatedly been blocked by the Laguna Beach 
City Council -- would cause extreme traffic jams for Laguna Beach commuters. 
The impact report estimates that the development would add 36,000 additional 
cars to the highway each day. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that building on the rolling hills would further destroy 
natural runoff in the canyon. Last month, Irvine Co. and county officials said 
that the Laguna Lakes, which are in the middle of the proposed community, are 
dying because of man-made runoff at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney and others attending the late-afternoon rally said that despite the long 
series of meetings and hearings on the issue, public opposition has never been 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine Co. spokeswoman Kathleen Campini said in an interview before the 
rally that the public has had ample opportunity to voice objections over the 
project and wondered why Lenney and others organized to picket in front of 
Bren's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it difficult to understand why they have chosen this type of activity 
to express their objections," Campini said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the company has made many concessions to environmentalists, such 
as offering to donate 1,137 acres to the county for a Laguna Laurel Regional 
Park to "form a scenic backdrop" to the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
The company also would donate 48 acres for a proposed Laguna Lakes Regional 
Park. The donation, according to Irvine Co. officials, would help save the only 
natural lake left in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We have really been working closely with the (Laguna Beach) Conservancy," 
Campini said. "The Irvine Co. has an outstanding record of working with them 
and other (environmental) groups." 
</P>
<P>
The planned community is to contain Mediterranean-style single-family homes, 
condominiums and apartments scattered in the northern section of the project 
area, according to Irvine Co. documents. A nine-acre elementary school and a 
12-acre shopping center are also planned along Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Below the housing and commercial tracts, the developer plans an 18-hole golf 
course and 26 acres of recreational park land, which would include bicycle 
trails, picnic areas and playing fields, according to an overview of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The land reserved for open-space reserve -- about 70% of the total project area 
-- is more than double the open space outlined in the original plan, Campini 
said. The changes were ordered by Irvine Co. officials after a number of public 
and private meetings with local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"The Laguna Laurel Planned Community is the culmination of many years of effort 
directed toward the development of a residential community nestled within the 
natural beauty of the surrounding canyon land," according to a 13-page Irvine 
Co. overview of the community. 
</P>
<P>
But protesters claimed Monday that the project would eventually destroy the 
ecosystem of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I drive home through the canyon every day," said Paula Klein, a Laguna Beach 
resident who joined in the protest. "Sometimes I stop to get out and feel the 
countryside. It's like a fix for me. But (the project) will kill that beauty."

COUNTY JAIL TAX MEASURE RESURRECTED; 
</P>
<P>
BILL BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE FOR 3RD TIME BUT ITS FATE IS UNCERTAIN

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In biblical lore, Lazarus was restored to life after being entombed for three 
days. The event was counted among Jesus Christ's greatest miracles. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento politics, a "Lazarus bill" is a legislative measure left for dead 
in one committee or another only to miraculously reappear. 
</P>
<P>
So it went Monday as state Sen. Marian Bergeson resurrected her measure to 
allow Orange County residents to vote on a half-cent sales tax for new jail and 
court construction -- a Lazarus bill if there ever was one. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, a Newport Beach Republican, revived her controversial measure for the 
third time this year when she convinced her colleagues in the state Senate to 
add it to a similar measure up for debate on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One More Chance 
</P>
<P>
The move now means that the half-cent sales tax proposition will have at least 
one more chance to become law before legislators finish their business for 1989 
in a frenzy of activity this week. The Senate will debate the merits of the 
Orange County tax proposal later this week, and could still vote it down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stop-and-go, stop-and-go," Bergeson said after the Senate voted to let 
the measure live again through amendments to the existing bill. "We're 
certainly pleased that we got the amendments passed" on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Legislature and signed into law by the governor, the sales 
tax proposal could go to Orange County voters as early as June, 1990. County 
supervisors have voted to build a new $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon, near 
Anaheim Hills, and they are counting on the sales tax to generate $121 million 
a year in seed money. (Voters in November will consider another half-cent sales 
tax increase for transportation improvements.) 
</P>
<P>
Monday's last-ditch revival of the sales tax bill prompted some senators -- led 
by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), Bergeson's Orange County challenger next year 
for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor -- to cry foul. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour and others claimed that Bergeson is trying to "subvert" the process and 
sneak the jail tax increase measure through at the last minute, rather than 
live by the legislative rules and face the fact that her proposal has been 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a policy in this house that when a matter has been turned down by a 
committee, you can't take that matter, amend it into some other bill and then 
bring it to the floor," said Seymour, who nonetheless agreed that Orange County 
is desperate to find some way to pay for a new jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Upholds the Rules 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we argue that there is a crying need, does that give us the right 
to break the rules? I say no," Seymour declared in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County's desperate state is exactly what Bergeson cited to persuade 
her colleagues to revive the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We are turning criminals loose," she told them. "The frustration level 
continues because the problems are acute and we are simply not having our 
problems addressed in a way that is really meeting local needs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bergeson killed the bill when Santa Ana city officials had 
it amended to make sure that the new jail wasn't built in their community. She 
later agreed to take it up again after striking a delicate political compromise 
that resulted in elimination of the Santa Ana amendment, instead placing the 
question of where to put the jail squarely in the hands of county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The second death knell seemed to come just before legislators broke for their 
summer recess in July, when an Assembly committee held up the tax measure 
because of nagging doubts about its constitutionality, since it would require 
only a simple majority vote, not the two-thirds majority mandated by 
Proposition 13, the 1978 tax-cutting initiative. Although the measure 
eventually passed committee, it was entombed in yet another Assembly committee, 
where those same doubts were expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson immediately began behind-the-scenes negotiations to incorporate the 
Orange County measure in a similar bill sponsored by Assemblyman Dan Hauser 
(D-Arcata). Hauser's bill would allow voters to consider the half-cent sales 
tax for jails in Humboldt, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
With Hauser's consent, Bergeson and Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) on Monday 
moved to add Orange and Los Angeles counties to that list. The Senate allowed 
the amendments by a vote of 20 to 10.

<P>
MOCK INVADERS TO TEST WEST COAST READINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Invading commandos in your back yard? Not to fear, the Navy knows. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you see them creeping into Anaheim Bay, the Navy says, don't be 
alarmed. The invaders are all part of an exercise to test the Navy and Coast 
Guard's ability to handle a coastal invasion. About 80,000 people are involved 
in the action, which began Monday and will continue until Sept. 22 from Seattle 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise is designed to test the readiness of the Maritime Defense Zone, a 
network of Coast Guard and Navy ships activated during wartime to defend 
coastal waters out to 200 miles from shore, said Navy spokesman Tom Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Any "attackers" who may be storming local beaches in the next week will not be 
armed with live ammo, Thomas said. They would only carry what the Navy calls 
Miles Gear, a sophisticated form of laser tag. The goal is to repel enemy 
attacks and capture and interrogate enemy forces, Thomas said. Details of the 
exercise are kept secret so that the element of surprise is preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Cmdr. David Bernstein said of the exercise: "Don't think in terms of an 
invasion." The action will simulate "low level conflict or a low intensity 
conflict, largely invisible to the general public. We do not expect a 
full-fledged Russian invasion of California." In the exercise and in real life, 
an invasion would probably be secret, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is particularly "vulnerable at its marshaling facilities," Berstein 
said. The Seal Beach U.S. Naval Weapons Station serves as a resupply dock, 
providing fuel, munitions and people to the Pacific Fleet, Berstein said, so it 
is critical to defend. "It's easy to stop operations in a harbor if you know 
what you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein is part of the "white team," which is responsible for umpiring the 
exercise. The good guys defending the coast are the blue team, and the invaders 
are the orange team. 
</P>
<P>
"The blue team is kept completely uninformed," said Coast Guard spokesman Jim 
Milbury. The idea, Milbury said, is to see how well the team responds to 
surprise attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In order to simulate actual wartime conditions, Bernstein said, the Navy staged 
anti-war demonstrations at various locations throughout Long Beach Harbor on 
Monday. Even phony news stories were circulated in Navy and Coast Guard 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar exercise at the Seal Beach station in 1986, Ron Sheridan, who 
participated in the exercise, ended up suing the Navy, claiming that he was 
beaten by an elite Navy combat team that had captured him at his home as a part 
of the exercise. Sheridan eventually received about a $65,000 settlement from 
the Navy, said Donald O'Kula, Sheridan's lawyer. O'Kula said "the Navy never 
admitted to any wrongdoing, but the money does say something." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said this year's exercise is "a completely different scenario." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the Navy "cannot stress safety enough in these exercises. In 
every single briefing safety is stressed. We try to be as realistic as 
possible, but safety is paramount."

POLICE SUSPECT FOUL PLAY AS RETARDED WOMAN VANISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Monday that foul play is suspected in the disappearance last 
weekend of a retarded 24-year-old woman last seen walking toward the 
mental-care facility where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
Kara McElravy -- described as 5 feet, 3 inches, 115 pounds, brown hair and blue 
eyes -- was last seen Saturday about 11:45 a.m. walking toward Petite Amis in 
the 13000 block of Wilson Street in Garden Grove, a mental-care facility for 
retarded adults, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Mark Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said that McElravy "functions at a 13-year-old level, but shows no 
outward signs of mental retardation." 
</P>
<P>
"She is overly friendly and naive and has no personal possessions or 
(identification) with her." 
</P>
<P>
When last seen by a friend, she was wearing a pink-and-white horizontally 
striped shirt, light blue pants and black boots, he said. Other distinguishing 
marks include warts under her chin. 
</P>
<P>
"She left all her property she normally wouldn't leave," Byrne said. "It was 
out of character for her." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about McElravy's whereabouts is asked to contact police 
at (714) 741-5704.

FOR GORDON WELLS, THERE IS MORE TO NFL UMPIRING THAN MEETS THE EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walking through the tunnel under Jack Murphy Stadium, Gordon Wells felt the 
sense of importance that has greeted him prior to every National Football 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, a resident of Huntington Beach, has worked 16 playoff games and two 
Super Bowls in his 18 seasons as an NFL umpire. He is third in longevity among 
umpires, a "solid, dependable" official, according to Art McNally, the league's 
supervisor of officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the performance of an NFL official usually goes unnoticed until he throws 
that yellow flag. 
</P>
<P>
Only when his flag falls do football fans take a good look at No. 89 in the 
black-and-white striped shirt, and it is a superficial look at best. 
</P>
<P>
"The average person thinks we just walk into the stadium and let the chips fall 
where they may," Wells said. "Nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Officials, paid anywhere from $600 to $2,000 a game plus expenses, attend 
clinics in the spring and summer. On fall weekends, they crisscross the 
country, spending much of their time in hotel rooms and airports. 
</P>
<P>
By kickoff time of a game that may last a little more than three hours, an 
official has spent about 12 hours in meetings. And the next day, they have to 
be back to their regular jobs as businessmen, educators, lawyers and insurance 
salesmen. Wells is chairman of the physical education department of Harbor 
College in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys really prepare," Wells said. "Then when the game is over, you are 
completely drained." 
</P>
<P>
An umpire's concentration is crucial, not only to his success, but his physical 
survival. Wells is 6-foot-2 and weighs 215 pounds, but he is dwarfed by today's 
professional linemen. He begins each play about 5 1/2 yards off the line of 
scrimmage, somewhere between the linebackers and defensive backs. It pays to be 
alert, he said: "On a draw play, your entire life goes before your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
In last year's Super Bowl, the ball landed on Wells' feet and so did just about 
everyone else. And earlier in the game, he was trapped between players in a 
misdirection play at the San Francisco goal line. Television replays showed him 
being buried beneath a heap of shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
"(The umpire) is in a precarious place," Wells said. "You're dodging players 
all the time. You do it by feel. If you have to look around for these guys, you 
might as well retire. You learn the value of preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
The impact cracked a small bone in Wells' foot, but he continued to work the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL does not allow officials to be interviewed during the regular season, 
so the last chance to get a glimpse of their routine was in an exhibition game 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to let the press in to talk to them," McNally said. "But we were 
averaging 15 requests a week. Where are you going to draw the line? Officials 
were constantly up in the forefront where they shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
The officiating crew arrives at the stadium two hours before kickoff. A parade 
of people, all involved in some aspect of game management, knock on the door to 
brief or be briefed. Crew chief Dick Hantak, the referee, meets with radio and 
TV announcers and discusses timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour before the kickoff, all exit: Wells, Hantak, head linesman Tom 
Johnson, line judge Don Carlsen, back judge Paul Baetz, side judge Gary Lane 
and field judge Ed Merrifield. Each patrols a different area of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Wells walks the length of the stadium, eyeing each player. He is primarily 
responsible for getting the 24 game balls to the field and checking for 
equipment violations. A wireless receiver is strapped to his back, the 
microphone taped to his neck. Wells is the official who communicates with the 
instant replay booth in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
Wells spots two Charger players with towels that do not meet NFL regulations. 
He informs them that a towel cannot be more than 12 inches long and can be worn 
only tucked into the side of the pants. The players want to know if the 
official is joking. Wells, with a firm smile, tells them he is serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of young guys, the first thing they think is that we're putting them on," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Wells is handed a card from the Phoenix trainer. It lists unusual medical 
equipment being worn, such as casts. Wells must check each one. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it's the linemen with casts," he explains. "They can play with casts, 
but we have a speech to give to each of them that says they can't use it as a 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Wells is amiable throughout the routine, plying his trade with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, official," Charger veteran linebacker Gil Byrd shouts. "This OK?" He 
points to a shorter towel on his hip. Wells nods approval. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out to be an uneventful game for Wells. He detects his first violation 
-- an illegal chop block -- at the 13:35 mark of the second quarter. In all, he 
whistles just five penalties in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Behind, 17-7, San Diego rallies to win, 21-20, on the final play of the game. A 
victory cannon sounds, and fans cheer the Chargers, who are whooping it up on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Wells walks slowly off the field with Hantak at his side. 
</P>
<P>
In the locker room, the crew fills out yellow cards that detail each penalty. 
The cards will be sent to the NFL's New York headquarters to be compared to the 
game films and to similar comment cards from each team's head coach. The 
information is used to rate each official's performance, which could ultimately 
lead to that Super Bowl assignment. Last year, four members of Wells' crew 
worked the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five minutes later, most of the crowd has left, although about a hundred 
autograph seekers mill around the tunnel outside the stadium. The fans pay 
little attention to the officials, who are escorted to their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, in coat and tie and eating a sandwich, admits he's tired but says he's 
glad he has only an hour and a half drive home, which means he can sleep in his 
own bed tonight instead of an airplane seat.

BOYS' TENNIS COACH AT UNIVERSITY HIGH RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Sisel has resigned his coaching position at University High School after 
18 years as the school's first and only boys' tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
Sisel, 45, said his decision wasn't prompted by any dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a heck of a lot of fun," he said. "I thought it was time for me 
to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Under Sisel, University had qualified for the Southern Section playoffs 18 
consecutive seasons. Sisel said one of his biggest thrills came when the 
Trojans won the 5-A championship in 1987. They stopped a 69-match winning 
streak by Santa Barbara in the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
Sisel will be replaced by Josh Davis, a Latin teacher at the school who also 
coaches the girls' junior varsity tennis and basketball teams. Davis has also 
assisted the boys' tennis team for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Sisel will continue teaching Spanish and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bova, who served as Sisel's assistant coach for 12 years, also resigned. 
The two have applied for the open position of golf coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to take over the golf program and see if we can bring it to the 
level we did in tennis," Sisel said.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
LINE PROVIDES LITTLE SUPPORT FOR PRINGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Pringle was accepting congratulations Monday. He had just been named the 
Big West Conference offensive player of the week, two days after running for 
164 yards and three touchdowns in Cal State Fullerton's 27-20 victory over Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
It is customary, even politically wise, for a running back to thank his 
offensive line in such situations. Forgive Pringle if he wasn't effusive. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle got his 164 yards with only sporadic help from a line that doesn't seem 
quite clear on the fact that when the crowd chants "Hold 'em," they're talking 
to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was called for holding four times on one second-half drive alone, 
during a five-minute stretch in which the Titans grounded out all of 32 yards. 
The line had a hand -- pun intended -- in turning a first-and-goal into a 
42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it seemed as if Fullerton's running attack made great progress 
Saturday, a week after being held to five yards rushing in a loss to Northern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
But of 189 yards rushing Saturday, 76 came when Pringle broke free for a 
touchdown, making very efficient use of a couple blocks. Another 29 came on a 
rare scramble by Dan Speltz, the longest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Take away those two runs and the Titans averaged 2.8 yards a carry. Do that 
three downs in a row and Coach Gene Murphy calls in Phil Nevin to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of numbers that left Murphy to assess the running game as 
"lukewarm" Monday -- not so hot yet, but a long way from all but frozen over. 
</P>
<P>
The problem doesn't have much to do with Pringle, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound back 
who Murphy says could be the best he has had. Pringle averaged nearly five 
yards a carry last season, and this season he's running in an offense similar 
to the one he ran in for two seasons at Washington State before transferring to 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the trouble stems from what Murphy calls the Titans' 
"equal-opportunity" line -- everybody is taking advantage of a chance to make a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Don Morel, the offensive line coach, offers that tackle Reggie Redding is 
playing very well. Beyond that, he'd rather not mention names. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just been breaking down, one player at a time," Morel said. 
</P>
<P>
Three players who started the season opener had seen little or no playing time 
in a major-college game -- guards Mike Rogan and Leita Leatutufu and tackle Tom 
Gang. Besides Redding, a 6-4, 295-pound pro prospect, center Marc Hauser is the 
only truly experienced starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very inexperienced," Morel said. "We just need to mature on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, the concern was more for the line's pass blocking. But Morel 
points out that Speltz has been sacked only twice in two games. 
</P>
<P>
And with the Titans' offensive emphasis on a short passing game this season, 
better to have a line that can handle the pass blocking. But better yet to have 
one that can handle both. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for that passing game to go like we want it to," Murphy said, "we 
have to get that running game going." 
</P>
<P>
How to Improve a Football Team: Schedule the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
True to the tradition of last year, when Fullerton opponents West Virginia and 
Wyoming enjoyed among the best seasons in their histories, the Titans' next 
opponent looks like it may be a better team than Fullerton imagined when it 
made the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State, which went 1-10 last season, is 0-2 this season in its first 
year under Earle Bruce, the former Ohio State coach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton meets the Rams Saturday at Fort Collins, Colo., and the scores of 
those losses seem to say something Fullerton would rather not hear. The Rams 
lost to Tennessee, 17-14. Tennessee later beat UCLA, 24-6. Saturday, the Rams 
played Colorado, a team picked to challenge Nebraska in the Big Eight this 
season. Colorado won, 45-20. 
</P>
<P>
Add Colorado State: Starting quarterback Kevin Verdugo suffered a shoulder 
sprain in the second quarter of Saturday's game and is listed as very doubtful 
for this week. 
</P>
<P>
Do No Wrong: Nevin, the freshman punter who turned down the Dodgers to kick and 
play baseball at Fullerton, has been flawless in two games. He has yet to miss 
a field goal, scoring on attempts of 21, 42 and 54 yards. He is five of five on 
PATs, and has a punting average of 40.2, with a long of 48.

HOSPITAL GROUP PULLING OUT OF COMPCARE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
VHA Enterprises, a national alliance of 668 nonprofit hospitals, said Monday 
that it will dissolve its joint venture with Comprehensive Care Corp. of Irvine 
because it is dissatisfied with the firm's psychiatric and drug treatment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Business generated by the joint venture last year produced $2.3 million in 
annual pre-tax earnings for CompCare, which received 70% of the joint venture's 
profits, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was an important profit center for CompCare, a faltering 
company that has seen its annual profits plummet from $17 million in 1985 to 
$502,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31. CompCare recently agreed to be 
bought by First Hospital Corp. in Norfolk, Va., for about $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dissolution of the joint venture, called Behavioral Medical Care, would have an 
"adverse impact" on CompCare if the hospitals choose not to renew their 
contracts, according to proxy documents that CompCare filed Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissolution Right Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care and First Hospital officials could not be reached for comment. But 
Robert E. Currie, attorney for CompCare, said: "It is the view of CompCare that 
VHA had no right under the joint-venture agreement to dissolve the joint 
venture." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy R. Cappel, attorney for VHA Enterprises, said that existing contracts 
between individual hospitals and Behavioral Medical Care will be honored until 
their expiration dates but that "there will be no new contracts and no renewals 
of existing contracts." 
</P>
<P>
VHA Enterprises said Monday that it has already formed a substitute joint 
venture with Parkside Medical Services, a subsidiary of Lutheran General 
Hospital in Park Ridge, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Cappel said that CompCare had agreed to terminate its joint venture with VHA 
but that First Hospital Corp. vetoed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Cappel said, VHA Enterprises filed a $4-million lawsuit in July 
against CompCare, its CareUnit subsidiary and First Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The suit argues that VHA has a legal right to dissolve the joint venture, begun 
in 1983, because CompCare has allegedly failed to perform its "obligations and 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ownership Clause 
</P>
<P>
Also, VHA said, terms of the joint agreement allow the venture to be terminated 
if one party changes ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Cappel said talks to settle the suit fell apart last week when CompCare 
countersued VHA. Among other complaints, CompCare has accused VHA of libel and 
slander for circulating a letter to client hospitals of the joint venture that 
criticized CompCare's treatment programs.

DESPITE SLUMP, ELECTRO RENT IS BUCKING TRENDS IN THE INSTRUMENT-LEASING FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early this year, Electro Rent Corp. Chief Executive Daniel Greenberg moved his 
company into a newly built, post-modern headquarters with a sculpture in the 
lobby and landscaped grounds, at a cost of nearly $15 million. It's the kind of 
move companies usually make when the business climate is sunny. But the climate 
isn't sunny for Electro Rent, a Van Nuys company that rents out high-tech 
testing and measuring devices. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Greenberg admitted, "There are a whole host of reasons for pessimism." 
</P>
<P>
But the move into new quarters is typical of Greenberg's confidence that his 
company is doing the right thing. Some companies search for new directions when 
hard times strike, but not Electro Rent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a nearly five-year slump in electronics, defense and aerospace -- the 
industries on which Electro Rent depends for rentals -- the company is sticking 
to its basic game plan -- to have plenty of distribution centers scattered 
throughout the country to be close to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly true elsewhere in the business, which has been hammered by 
price-cutting in the last few years. The rental market for high-tech testing 
gear is anywhere from $350 million to $450 million a year, depending on who is 
doing the counting. Electro Rent, with about $115 million in revenues (not all 
of it in instrument rentals), is the biggest player. But Electro Rent's closest 
rivals have cut back their number of distribution centers to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Those rivals include United States Instrument Rental (USIR) in Dallas, which is 
owned by Ford, and Leasametric in Foster City, Calif., which is owned by the 
billionaire Pritzker family of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, those companies and others have begun centralizing their equipment 
centers' operations. Leasametric reduced its system of satellite offices, and 
USIR cut back from three regional distribution centers to one. But although 
Electro Rent reduced its payroll from 523 to 486 last year through attrition 
and layoffs, it has essentially stuck to a local-office strategy. Electro Rent 
still has 10 equipment depots across the country. Greenberg acknowledges that 
the approach is far more costly but insists that it is the only way for Electro 
Rent to maintain its lead. 
</P>
<P>
USIR's senior vice president, Jack Cunningham, said of his company's 
consolidation, "We've done it because we think we're right." 
</P>
<P>
"Our competitors have made a serious mistake," Greenberg said. "They will 
suffer because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but refusing to scale back its operations is still a gamble for 
Greenberg, because Electro Rent does not have the deepest pockets in the 
business. USIR and Leasametric, with their wealthy parents, obviously can get 
cheap financing in a business that depends heavily on borrowing to buy 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg is sticking with his old strategy of staying close to his customers 
because it has paid off before. For five years, beginning in 1980, when Electro 
Rent was spun off as an independent public company from its parent company, 
Telecor, its sales grew at an average rate of 29%, reaching $89.9 million in 
1985. Profits rose steadily, hitting $10.8 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Buildup 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the instrument rental business was closely tied to the Reagan-era 
defense buildup. "I'd like to tell you it all had to do with my personal 
genius," Greenberg said. But "we were all being pulled by the runaway train of 
the Reagan revolution." 
</P>
<P>
But beginning in 1985, that runaway train got switched onto a sidetrack. The 
yearly growth rate of Electro Rent's revenues tailed off, and in the latest 
fiscal year, which ended in May, its sales shrank less than 1% to $114.5 
million. Meanwhile, its profits fell three out of the past four years and stood 
at $7.9 million in fiscal year 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That's when trouble struck Electro Rent's business. The company's main line is 
renting out sophisticated electronic testing equipment, from devices such as a 
$500 digital voltage meter to high-tech gadgets such as a $60,000 microwave 
spectrum analyzer, which monitors the frequency of microwave transmissions. 
Electronics and aerospace firms rent the devices for short projects when buying 
isn't practical, or when they want to avoid sinking money into hardware that 
may become obsolete. Electro Rent's best customers are defense contractors, 
such as Lockheed, Boeing and TRW, who find renting especially convenient to 
help assign equipment costs to specific government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping its equipment in the field is essential for Electro Rent to make money. 
When Electro Rent buys, say, the $60,000 microwave spectrum analyzer, the 
company turns around and rents it for 6% to 11% of the purchase price per month 
(or about $3,600 to $6,600), hoping to keep it in use 60% of the time. After 
about three years, Electro Rent sells the analyzer for $30,000 to $45,000. The 
resale is crucial and helps Electro Rent turn a profit on the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Turning a profit is tougher than it used to be because of a wave of 
price-cutting in instrument rentals. Some of the most visible price-cutting was 
done by Telogy, a new Redwood City, Calif., company, as it competed for big 
contracts. But USIR's Cunningham said, "I think we all shot ourselves in our 
own foot." Whoever initiated it, the price cuts had a clear effect. Electro 
Rent's profit margin per dollar of sales fell from 12% in 1985 to 7% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Growth 
</P>
<P>
Reeling from slow growth and evaporating profit margins, most of Electro Rent's 
competitors rethought the business and decided to cut their distribution costs 
by closing some offices. Electro Rent, of course, believes that keeping a 
number of regional offices across the country helps its marketing, delivery and 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent tougher times, Electro Rent has also embarked on a $44-million 
stock repurchase program to consolidate Greenberg's and his family's grip on 
the company and to help boost the stock to near its five-year high recently. 
Greenberg, with his family, holds about 36% of Electro Rent's stock, worth 
about $27 million at recent trading prices. 
</P>
<P>
Will Greenberg's defiant strategy work? Industry analyst Gerald Fleming of 
Fahnestock &amp; Co. pointed out that Electro Rent's profit margin remains 
solid at about 7%. And he notes that Greenberg seems to have known what he was 
doing in the past. "You can't fight with success," Fleming said.

'SECOND SHIFT' EXAMINES WOMEN'S PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MAUSHARD, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working the second shift has a new meaning. No longer is the second shift 
personified by a worker -- usually male -- going off to a job in bright 
daylight, dinner pail in hand. A worker who will come home after the late news, 
usually to "wind down" with TV or a newspaper before turning in at 2 or 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there are still plenty of those second-shifters, but the notion is being 
updated, personified this decade by a worker -- most likely female -- coming 
home to a job in the twilight, children and groceries in hand. This worker 
often stays busy until after the late news, too, but requires little winding 
down and has almost no time for TV or reading; she simply falls into bed beside 
her already-sleeping husband when she's had enough or has done all that is 
expected of her. 
</P>
<P>
These new second-shifters are today's working wives and mothers, women who work 
outside their homes as well as in, women who continue to shoulder most of the 
housework, child care, cooking and shopping for their families. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of these women, and their husbands, is detailed in "The Second 
Shift, Working Parents and the Evolution at Home," a new book by sociologist 
Arlie Hochschild (Viking, New York, $18.95). 
</P>
<P>
"Most women work one shift at the office or factory and a 'second shift' at 
home," Hochschild writes. That second shift, she found, amounts to an extra 
month of 24-hour days each year or about 15 hours a week that such women -- and 
not their husbands -- put in at home. 
</P>
<P>
Besides wearing out the second-shifters -- "these women talked about sleep the 
way a hungry person talks about food" -- balancing home, family and job strains 
their marriages, robs their children and weighs heavily on their own psyches, 
says the author, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, not all women are working the second shift alone. But in Hochschild's 
study of 50 mainstream couples interviewed from 1980 to 1988, 20% of the men 
shared housework equally, 70% did less than half but more than one-third of the 
work, and the remaining 10% did less than one-third of the chores, which 
included housework, cooking, gardening, household repairs and such duties as 
planning children's birthday parties, sending holiday cards and paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when couples share more equitably in the work at home, women do 
two-thirds of the daily jobs at home, like cooking and cleaning up -- jobs that 
fix them into a rigid routine. Most women cook dinner and most men change the 
oil in the family car. . . . Women do more child care than men, and men repair 
more household appliances. A child needs to be tended daily while the repair of 
household appliances can often wait until 'I have time,' " Hochschild writes. 
</P>
<P>
Hochschild's findings bear out those of earlier studies. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Robinson, a University of Maryland researcher, found in a 1985 study of 
5,000 men and women that American women with children under 5 do an average of 
22.5 hours of housework a week and those with children over 5 do 19.9 hours 
weekly. For every two hours women spent on housework, men spent only one, 
Robinson's survey indicated. If there's good news, it's that in 1975 the ratio 
was 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
How men and women spent those hours also coincided with Hochschild's 
conclusions. Women were doing 77% of the cooking, down from 87% in a similar 
1965 University of Michigan survey, while men did 74% of the yard work and 82% 
of the home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
And a 1986 survey, conducted for Johnson Wax, found that women, both employed 
and unemployed, did 84% of the housecleaning -- just one of the second-shift 
duties listed by Hochschild. 
</P>
<P>
All of these numbers support what Hochschild calls a "stalled revolution," 
caused by rapid changes in women -- in their roles in the family and society, 
in their earning power and in their goals -- coupled with slower changes in men 
and society. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution continues to idle because of a "cultural veneer that disguises 
how painful and confusing" it is, Hochschild said in a phone interview. The 
veneer shows the double-shift woman as happy, organized, together and, most of 
all, not resentful, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I was trying to do was to peel off the veneer," she said. 
"Revolutions are messy; revolutions are confusing; revolutions are painful." 
</P>
<P>
This one is no different.

CRITIC AT LARGE: BRAN FERREN: MASTER OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bran Ferren is an affable, red-haired, round-faced whiz person. Neither face 
nor name sets off a large clanging of bells, but Ferren and his team bear 
responsibility for, among many other items in and out of film, that hungry and 
ever-growing plant in "Little Shop of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
They also did hallucinatory passages in "Altered States," Ferren's first film, 
and a tornado for the Sally Field film "Places in the Heart." They helped on 
"Star Trek V" and the forthcoming "Second Sight." 
</P>
<P>
Ferren did his first Broadway stage work, lighting and special effects, for 
"Crucifer of Blood," and subsequently lent his hand to "Evita," "Cats" and 
"Sunday in the Park with George." 
</P>
<P>
He has done TV commercials and still photography -- a wine glass on a glacier, 
that kind of thing. Now, Ferren has made his first feature, "Funny," which 
opens Sept. 22 at the Monica 4-Plex in Santa Monica and which, I think it fair 
to say, is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
What Ferren did was persuade more than 100 people to stand in front of a fixed 
camera and tell their favorite jokes, some 2,000 of them. He shot 150,000 feet 
of 35-millimeter film, on everybody from Dick Cavett, Eli Wallach and Anne 
Jackson to a gun-store clerk in North Carolina, a bartender and passers-by on 
street corners, more unknowns than knowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted something I could do in bits, without actors or continuity," Ferren 
said the other afternoon on the roof of a West Hollywood hotel, where he shot 
some of the jokes. He needed a project he could do while he was doing 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
The everything else includes designing the opticals for Revo sunglasses, 
possibly the most expensive extant at upwards of $150, and involving 30 layers 
of film to filter unwanted rays. It also includes optical projects for the Navy 
and NASA and devices for film, including a new optical printer that received 
one of the three scientific awards Ferren and his partners have had from the 
motion picture academy. 
</P>
<P>
Ferren attended high school and MIT but did not, he says, wait around for a 
diploma from either. "I come from a family of artists," Ferren says, "and one 
side of me was going to be an artist and the other side a scientist." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was as if an occult hand had made a mystical sign above him and 
whispered, "Both, both." 
</P>
<P>
He started young, he says, doing lighting for summer-stock productions. In no 
exact sequence, he designed the lighting and light shows for the Electric 
Circus and Studio 54 discos in New York, created the traveling light show for 
an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer tour (his first venture in that milieu; he has 
since designed a Paul Mc-Cartney tour). 
</P>
<P>
"It's like never having to grow up," Ferren says. "If you can be gainfully 
employed but no one knows exactly what you do, people will say you're a 
genius." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Ferren is actually Associates and Ferren, a 40-person outfit 
headquartered in Long Island's East Hampton, augmented to as many as 100 when 
in the grip of a special project like "Little Shop of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
"And we all work on everything, the theme parks, the museums and the research 
in optical computation. That's something, optical computation instead of 
computers -- working with the speed of light." 
</P>
<P>
In this mating of the arts and the sciences his gift is, Ferren says, 
essentially as the matchmaker. "I take ideas, which often deal with 
intangibles, and translate them into tangibles. I know how art and technology 
can intersect. And we figure out how to use technology in a transparent 
fashion" (that is, so the ends not the means draw the attention). 
</P>
<P>
The sunglasses, he says, were an interesting case. "They said, 'Can you design 
the best sunglasses in the world?' I said, 'Yes.' What else could I say? It was 
a great challenge, aesthetic because they had to look great and a serious 
scientific project because they had to do a better job of filtering the rays." 
The glasses, not yet available in prescription, are selling embarrassingly 
well, Ferren says. 
</P>
<P>
"I succumb to obvious distractions," he says, which is why he made "Funny" so 
primer simple, to prove he could work without technology or special effects. He 
did the camera work himself (the cinematographer is listed as I.C. Dailies, 
which approximates the level of humor of some of the jokes). 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a film about jokes, it's a film about people." It is indeed closer to 
"Candid Camera" than to "Richard Pryor Live." A lot closer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fascinations for Ferren were how widely and fast jokes travel. In one 
instance, he cuts between three or four people telling the same joke at 
different times in different places. 
</P>
<P>
There are many Jewish jokes. No anti-Semitism, Ferren thinks; most of the jokes 
are told by Jews and reflect, in his view, a long history of storytelling among 
Jews. A few of the crudest jokes are told by women. Ferren has no explanation; 
it may be an aspect of liberation, a kind of down-shifted equality. 
</P>
<P>
Ferren is working up two new and entirely dissimilar film projects. One, he 
says, is a $30-million special-effects film that he can do for $7 million. The 
other is a small love story involving three people that could be done for less 
than half a million. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it would be easier to sell the studios on the big one than the small 
one. And a side of me says I'd prefer to do the $350,000 film with a sad 
ending. The fact is I'll be happy to do either." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite joke from "Funny" has St. Peter doing a small survey of new 
arrivals, asking how much they earned. The first man, a lawyer, says he made 
$250,000 last year. The stockbroker says he made $600,000. The third man, 
unidentified, says he made $6,000. 'Ah," says St. Peter, "was there something I 
would have seen you in?" 
</P>
<P>
Ferren's high school eventually gave him a diploma, figuring that his 
post-curricular achievements made up for the missing credits.

SANTA MONICA IN AVANT-GARDE OF NEW ART SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' peripatetic gallery scene has gone about as far west as it can go 
-- and dug in its heels. 
</P>
<P>
After taking form on La Cienega Boulevard, strolling around West Hollywood, 
having a fling downtown and setting up shop on La Brea Avenue, the scene has 
settled into Santa Monica, where new galleries are popping up faster than nail 
parlors and Benetton shops. In the three years since the James Corcoran Gallery 
moved from West Hollywood to Santa Monica, about 25 fine-art galleries have 
opened there -- closer to 50 if you count the more commercial establishments 
that present exhibitions of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, it was a toss up between La Brea and Santa Monica as to which 
would develop. Now it's apparent that Santa Monica is the place," said dealer 
Richard Green. He will vacate his La Brea Avenue gallery later this fall and 
open in December at 2036 Broadway, a 6,000-square-foot space in one of Santa 
Monica's new gallery rows. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Weinberg Gallery is leaving West Hollywood for the same one-story brick 
complex and opening in November with a Richard Artschwager show. Immediately 
east of Green and Weinberg are three other galleries: Krygier-Landau 
(transplanted from Beverly Boulevard), Meyers-Bloom and Andrea Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Park your car once, see five shows. Not bad for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, the Broadway five are only a dozen blocks away from a strip mall of 
galleries along Colorado Avenue that offers an unprecedented 10 exhibitions for 
one parking place. Visitors shod in Reeboks or Nikes can easily take in an 
additional 10 shows if they light out on cross streets east and west of the 
Colorado group. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Corcoran, the Colorado galleries (between 9th and 10th streets) seem 
to have been a magnet for the art trade. None of the first arrivals have bailed 
out and many more have joined them during the past two years. The latest 
addition, at 924 Colorado Ave., is the Linda Cathcart Gallery. Cathcart, former 
director of the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, is scheduled to open her 
first gallery on Sept. 28 with a show of Robert Longo's work. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Maloney recently split off from Maloney-Butler Gallery (leaving Marilyn 
Butler operating independently at 910 Colorado Ave.), but he is opening a new 
gallery on Sept. 23 at 602 Colorado Ave. In the same building are John Thomas 
Galleries, a branch of a Fullerton gallery opening Thursday, and Bryce 
Bannatyne Gallery, which specializes in late 19th- and 20th-Century design. 
</P>
<P>
More talked about than any of these moves, however, is the arrival of Luhring 
Augustine Hetzler in a refurbished building at 1330 4th St. The gallery is a 
partnership between Luhring Augustine in New York and Max Hetzler of Cologne. 
The new gallery will show the work of American and European contemporary 
artists already represented by the two partners, but it will forge a somewhat 
independent direction including young Los Angeles talent, according to director 
Fran Seegull. 
</P>
<P>
Luhring Augustine Hetzler is scheduled to open on Sept. 23 with a solo 
exhibition of Stephen Prina's work and a group show featuring gallery artists. 
Given the present appearance of the elegant old building, no one believes that 
the entire construction project will be finished by then, but Seegull says the 
invitations are printed and the exhibitions will open on time. 
</P>
<P>
Luhring Augustine and Max Hetzler have worked together for several years, but 
why did their formal partnership emerge in Southern California? "It's pretty 
clear that Los Angeles is becoming a very serious contemporary art city," 
Seegull said. Another attraction is that, unlike New York, the scene is still 
small enough that a newcomer can become part of the art community, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And why did the partners lease a building in Santa Monica instead of farther 
east? Because they preferred having a building to themselves and found just the 
thing on 4th Street. It has about 4,500 square feet of exhibition space, 
divided into two galleries that will present separate, concurrent shows. 
</P>
<P>
While Luhring Augustine Hetzler moves west, longtime Venice dealer Peter Goulds 
of L.A. Louver Gallery is opening an eastern outpost. Louver Gallery New York 
will launch itself in SoHo on Oct. 7 with an exhibition of assemblage sculpture 
by Edward Kienholz and Nancy Reddin Kienholz -- their first New York gallery 
show in 23 years. This may be the first time in history that a Los Angeles 
dealer has moved east without closing up the local shop, and it's a development 
that seems certain to benefit Los Angeles artists represented by the gallery, 
as well as other members of the gallery's international stable. 
</P>
<P>
All the talk about Santa Monica's art boom may give the impression that gallery 
business has dried up east of 22nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Not true. In fact, two of the hottest rumors -- that Asher-Faure Gallery and 
Rosamund Felsen Gallery are moving west -- are untrue. After looking in Santa 
Monica, both dealers have decided to stay more or less where they are. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the light industrial spaces in Santa Monica," said Pat Faure of 
Asher-Faure, but she fears the area may have a short-term life for dealers who 
are leasing spaces that are likely to be sold in areas ripe for development. 
Instead of pouring money into a Santa Monica building, Faure is renovating her 
West Hollywood gallery on Almont Drive -- restoring the little 1905 house in 
the front to its original form, paving the driveway that leads to the main 
gallery behind the house and restructuring the gallery foyer to make more 
exhibition space. "We're just making it more beautiful," Faure said. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked in Santa Monica, but the more I looked the less I wanted to be 
there," said Rosamund Felsen, who maintains one of the few remaining galleries 
on La Cienega Boulevard. Aware that some potential clients drive right by her 
gallery simply because they can't find a place to park, she is in search of 
more spacious accommodations with better parking near the area where she has 
done business for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Faure's and Felsen's entrenchment points up the fact that West Hollywood and 
Wilshire Center combined still have more galleries than Santa Monica. Despite 
the loss of Weinberg, Green, Krygier-Landau, Ruth Bachofner and Roy Boyd, there 
remain such prestigious showcases as the Margo Leavin Gallery, which has 
undergone a dramatic expansion and permanently installed a Claes Oldenburg 
sculpture on its Hilldale Avenue site. One advantage of the area is that the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art serves as an anchor and draws visitors to 
nearby galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers on the near and far west sides of town tout the virtues of their chosen 
locales: Santa Monica's clean air, industrial spaces and plentiful parking vs. 
Los Angeles' sense of history and proximity to city life. Both sides say that 
it's cheaper to do business on their side of town, but no one claims that it's 
cheap. Leases run around $1.50 to $2 per square foot, which can easily total 
$10,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
All across town, the season has officially started: 55 openings last week, 45 
this week. The Santa Monica/Venice Art Dealers Assn. kicked off the fall 
gallery season over the weekend with an open house, including openings of Ciel 
Bergman's paintings at the Dorothy Goldeen Gallery and an auction for the 
benefit of the C.G. Jung Institute at Pence Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
If competition for attention is fierce, there's also strength in numbers. 
Openings in neighboring galleries more than double the attendance of a single 
opening, dealers say, and clusters of openings bring out even larger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to be too much," said Roy Boyd, who arrived in Santa Monica for his 
Saturday opening the day after his Chicago gallery had launched a show. "But 
people seem to like the circus aspect, and it is fun."

SWARMS OF YELLOW JACKETS PUT CALIFORNIANS TO FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Californians will remember this summer not for heat waves or pennant races 
but for the swarms of meat-eating yellow jackets that have declared a painful 
war on bare skin as far north up the Pacific Coast as British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"Those suckers are eating us alive," said Ruth Budesa of Sonora, a town in the 
Sierra Nevada foothills that has one of the worst infestations in what has 
become the worst summer for yellow jackets in memory. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow jackets are a plague to late-summer picnickers every year in much of the 
West. But this year the wasps are driving loggers out of the forests, forcing 
campers to flee state parks and sending many more people to the hospital, some 
in serious condition. At least one horse has died after scaring up a nest of 
the wasps, sometimes called meat bees because of their appetite for flesh. 
</P>
<P>
"This in my 10 years of experience is the worst I've ever seen for meat bees," 
said Ed Heneveld, who treats sting victims in the emergency room at Tahoe 
Forest Hospital in Truckee. "I've treated five people myself who have been 
stung inside the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 sting victims sought aid at the Yosemite medical clinic this 
weekend, including one person in severe shock, spokeswoman Mallory Smith said 
Monday. About 100 visitors have reported stings in the last three weeks, and 
park rangers are advising campers to avoid eating outside if they can help it. 
</P>
<P>
Weather is one factor in the yellow jacket invasion. Mild winters allowed more 
queen yellow jackets to survive and set up new nests in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
This time of year is also when the worker yellow jackets turn more assertive in 
their search for protein to stock the queen's winter nest. The workers go after 
sandwiches, fish, soft drinks, hamburgers, even human skin -- anything that 
resembles meat or sugar for the nest. 
</P>
<P>
But entomologists also put some of the blame for the yellow jacket invasion on 
a new, more aggressive species of wasp from northern Europe. The Germanica 
variety swarms in much bigger colonies than the native California wasps. 
Instead of 150 to 300 worker wasps capable of stinging, a nest of the German 
intruders can have 5,000 to 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
And they are more belligerent, say insect experts, although the yellow jacket 
is not one of the more friendly airborne insects even on his best days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiation Disrupted 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend some ornery yellow jackets disrupted the initiation of new 
"Clampers" -- members of the fraternal group E Clampus Vitus -- at Kennedy 
Meadows in the central Sierra Nevada. In one rite an egg was broken over the 
head of an inductee. 
</P>
<P>
"They swarmed all over his head," said Terry Barchus, an observer who escaped 
with one sting on his arm. "He had to be washed off real fast. Luckily he 
wasn't stung." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting back is not advisable, say those with experience. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as you slap at a yellow jacket they immediately sting," said Glenn 
Bissell, who has fought a losing battle against the wasps for nine years for 
the El Dorado County Health Department. "You have to brush them off slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, which was the worst of the 1980s before now, Bissell caught about 
five or six wasps a week in each trap he set out in the Lake Tahoe area. Now he 
is catching more than 50 a week in each trap, some of them the German variety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Phenomenal Number' 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing just a phenomenal number of yellow jackets," Bissell said. "The 
beaches are just humming with them right now." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Janice Carmen was riding horses at Clark's Fork, east of 
Sonora in the Emigrant Wilderness, when the two lead horses walked over a nest 
and scared up a cloud of wasps. The third horse, a 14-year-old gelding named 
Cody, was stung severely on the legs and haunches. Carmen, riding on the fourth 
mount, managed to help gather the horses and get them away without being stung 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Cody was surrounded by a second swarm and stung again before the group made it 
back to camp. The animal went into shock, Carmen said, and died soon after 
despite a veterinarian's care. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing you can do is find where they go in the ground at night, pour 
motor oil into the burrow and light it," Carmen said. 
</P>
<P>
All yellow jackets make pests of themselves in about the same way. They hover 
around food and sweet drinks and, when they land, will try to grab pieces of 
food with their mandibles. The mandibles can also be used to bite humans, but 
it is the stinger that contains the venom. Unlike honey bees, which typically 
sting once and leave their stinger, yellow jackets can sting repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sting Can Be Deadly 
</P>
<P>
"One sting is enough to kill a hyper-sensitive human," said George Poinar, an 
entomologist at UC Berkeley. "Fifty to 75 stings are enough to kill a normal 
human." 
</P>
<P>
California officials are unable to recall any fatalities blamed for certain on 
yellow jackets. However, Roger Akre, an entomologist at the University of 
Washington who wrote the landmark book on yellow jackets, said that more than 
500 people a year in the United States may die of sting reactions that are 
attributed to heart attacks or other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers and other forest workers are being hit harder than tourists this year. 
Trucks and tractors on the forest floor disturb the nests, then the wasps swarm 
and drive the operators and loggers for cover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loggers Refusing to Work 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, loggers have been refusing to work, said Dan Ward of the Sonora 
office of the California Department of Forestry. "As soon as you get out of the 
truck you have them buzzing around your head," he said. "If you come near their 
nest they come out with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
The good news, say the insect experts, is that the wasps should begin to die 
off as soon as the weather turns cool. "This is probably the last big month," 
Poinar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NASTY SUMMER VISITOR 
</P>
<P>
Yellow jackets, wasps of the genus Vespula, are most active in late summer. 
Found in most of the West, they sometimes build hives in attics or under eaves, 
but the most threatening species to humans nest in the ground. This time of 
year they are drawn to many kinds of foods -- meat, fish and sweet things such 
as soft drinks and candy -- seeking protein to store in the nest for winter. 
Yellow jackets sting when provoked and, unlike honey bees, can sting 
repeatedly. They also have mandibles used to grab meat and, sometimes, to bite 
humans. Sting victims should seek immediate medical help if they feel any 
difficulty breathing, a lump in the throat or chest pain.W.T. DAVIDSON /

NEW PARTS URGED FOR 1,900 MCDONNELL DOUGLAS PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As a safety precaution, more than 1,900 aging McDonnell Douglas airliners 
should have critical parts replaced or modified at a cost of about $563 
million, with most of the work being done over the next 10 years, a 
government-industry task force said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to begin the process of issuing 
repair orders for 1,153 U.S.-registered aircraft later this week, affecting 
fuselages, landing gears, doors and other parts of early models of the DC-8, 
DC-9, MD-80 and DC-10. 
</P>
<P>
More than 750 planes registered to foreign carriers probably will face repair 
directives from an international agency, a spokesman for the Air Transport 
Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar action was taken on older Boeing passenger jets last May as part of a 
dramatic change in philosophy for maintaining the airworthiness of aging 
aircraft. Instead of simply requiring regular inspections of planes for signs 
of metal fatigue, the FAA is requiring modifications when they have reached a 
certain age or have made a certain number of flights, regardless of what the 
inspections show. 
</P>
<P>
The new philosophy emerged after the accident last year in which a stewardess 
was sucked out of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 that lost an 18-foot 
section of its fuselage. After the incident over Hawaii, industry and 
government formed joint task forces to recommend ways "to increase safety 
margins," in the words of coordinator Clyde Kizer of the Air Transport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
75,000-Landing Standard 
</P>
<P>
Modifications to the McDonnell Douglas planes will be made as an aircraft 
reaches a "threshold" of about 75,000 landings. In the next four years, only 
about 100 planes will cross that threshold, but the bulk of the 1,900 airliners 
in the fleet will cross it in the following six years. A relative few will 
undergo repairs in the subsequent 10 years, FAA and industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the impact on airline fares and service will be negligible, 
Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent is to provide enough lead time so that airlines could schedule 
these modifications into their normal maintenance programs," he said. "Also, 
programming the changes, instead of doing it by find-and-fix, should reduce 
costs. Of course, you never know when you open a plane up what you will find in 
areas you have never looked. But we don't anticipate finding any surprises." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the economic impact on individual airlines and other owners 
of affected aircraft could vary widely, depending on the age of planes in their 
fleets and the quality of their maintenance programs, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Harm Small Firms 
</P>
<P>
"The airlines would have been doing these things for some time under existing 
FAA service bulletins," said Paul Turk of Avmark Inc. of Arlington, Va., an 
aviation management consulting firm. "But I can see charters with DC-8s or 
small package operators with older DC-9s getting stung." 
</P>
<P>
Based on task force recommendations, the FAA will issue proposed "airworthiness 
directives" that will become permanent after about three months of public 
comment. Officials said none of the targeted aircraft apparently require 
immediate repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed directives call for 52 modifications to critical structures in the 
DC-8, costing about $161,000 per aircraft; 52 in the DC-9, costing $490,000, 
largely because of expensive landing gear modifications; 22 in the MD-80, 
costing $90,000, and 33 in the DC-10, costing $74,000. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas officials termed the number of required service actions 
relatively small, considering that the task force reviewed more than 3,900 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The formation of the industry-government task force on airworthiness assurance 
is one of the best things that has happened in the aviation industry in the 
last 30 years," said Dale Warren, a vice president for Douglas Aircraft Co. of 
Long Beach, a unit of McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Aircraft Makers 
</P>
<P>
Another task force will make recommendations later this year for aircraft built 
by Lockheed, Airbus, British Aerospace Corp. and Fokker. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said the modifications recommended for McDonnell Douglas planes were 
similar to those for Boeing, with two major exceptions. On the Boeing 747, 
heavy structural material will have to be replaced in the nose section. And on 
the Boeing 727 and 737, major repairs will have to be made on fuselage lap 
joints -- the source of disintegration in the Aloha accident. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference on the McDonnell Douglas recommendations, Kizer 
said that "none of the problems we have identified are present today. We are 
taking action to prevent their occurrence mostly in a 4- to 10-year time frame 
down the line."

PRIVATE PRISONER VANS; 
</P>
<P>
EXTRADITION: IS THE RIDE TOO ROUGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn Cantrell's life changed so fast it could almost give a person whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
One day she's cruising in a Hollywood world: a personal secretary for actors, 
going to parties at the Playboy Mansion, living a life that didn't give her and 
her two children all that much to complain about. The next day she looks out 
her window and the police are coming to her door. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-week stint in a crowded jail cell in Bakersfield, Cantrell -- 
wanted on a year-old check fraud charge in Missouri -- was put in a van with 
eight male prisoners. For the next five days, she says, she was verbally 
harassed, groped, humiliated and finally raped -- not by her fellow detainees, 
but by her guards, who were employed by a private extradition company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zigzag Journey 
</P>
<P>
At one point on her zigzag journey from California to Missouri, the guards took 
her across the Arizona border into Nogales, Mexico. There, she says, they tried 
to sell her sexual services to Mexican law enforcement officers, who begged off 
once they realized the guards were serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I do realize that I made a mistake with writing a bad check," Cantrell wrote 
in notes to herself while awaiting trial in Missouri. "But . . . this was a 
hell of a price to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Hellish road trips such as the one described in lawsuits by Cantrell and 
others, and a number of alarming prisoner escapes, have caused law enforcement 
officials across the country to question the growing use of private extradition 
companies to transport prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say private firms save money for states and county governments. But 
critics of the growing privatization of law enforcement say inhumane treatment 
of prisoners often is the cost of the savings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Convicted 
</P>
<P>
"What's amazing to me is that most of these people haven't been convicted of 
any crime, and yet they put them into crowded vans, in chains, and they even 
have to sleep sitting up," said a Los Angeles police detective familiar with 
extraditions. "With these companies obviously the name of the game is big 
volume. To me it's making a profit off of people's woes." 
</P>
<P>
Private extradition companies have been a topic at recent meetings of the 
National Assn. of Extradition Officials. "The attitude of many in the 
association is that the use of private extradition companies is something to be 
handled cautiously because of the potential liability," said Earl Dorius, past 
president of the association and an assistant attorney general in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the use of such companies has grown in recent years as the 
privatization of government functions has increased in popularity. Extradition 
Corporation of America, one of the largest extradition firms and the company 
that was hired by Camdenton, Mo., to extradite Cantrell from California in 
1986, recently signed an exclusive three-year contract with the California 
Department of Corrections to transport prisoners to state institutions and to 
all 58 California counties. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials did not respond to requests for interviews. But, in court 
papers, they have denied allegations made by Cantrell and others in a number of 
lawsuits pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Cantrell's allegations were considered serious enough in Camdenton, Mo., 
though, that the county no longer employs the company. And rape allegations 
made by another woman last year who said she was assaulted by a guard while en 
route from West Virginia to Los Angeles prompted an investigation by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney of Extradition Corporation of America's 
overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing female and male prisoners transported by the company, 
Barbara Moore, extradition chief for Los Angeles County, turned a host of 
allegations of inhumane treatment and unsafe conditions over to the state 
attorney general's office in June. As a result, the state Department of 
Corrections now is conducting its own investigation of the company's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Vans 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she was concerned from the beginning about the use of vans to 
transport prisoners for long distances. "We don't have a lot of say about the 
contract," she said. "All we can do is make what we have learned available to 
the people who can do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the rape allegation -- which Moore would not discuss -- the 
complaints mostly stemmed from prisoners being transported long distances in 
shackles in often overcrowded, overheated vans. Prisoners -- who often don't 
get to change clothes or shower during the days-long trips -- reach their 
destinations with leg and wrist injuries and complaining of lack of sleep, 
infrequent restroom stops and poor medical attention. Some prisoners have 
arrived in need of hospitalization, complaining that the guards did not heed 
their pleas for medical attention, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
After Marilyn Cantrell was arrested Aug. 5, 1986, at her home at Edwards Air 
Force Base on check fraud charges, she agreed to waive extradition proceedings. 
She says she thought she would be quickly flown cross country to stand trial in 
Missouri. She admits that she stopped payment on a $15,000 check to a Missouri 
resort in 1985 because she thought she was being double billed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being flown back to stand trial, though, Cantrell says she was 
shocked two weeks after her arrest when two men wearing blue jeans and 
Extradition Corporation of America shirts came to the jail to pick her up. They 
told her they would be making the journey by van. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were joking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What she says happened next, though, was no joke. The now-36-year-old mother of 
two was locked in a caged compartment in the back of the van, she says. Over 
the next five days, while careening over mountain roads and across deserts and 
plains through five states, she says she was subjected to almost constant 
harassment and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the guards began making sexual comments to her, asking if 
she were married and if she liked to fool around, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Cruel' 
</P>
<P>
"They were very cruel to us," Cantrell said, alleging that sometimes the 
prisoners were only fed once a day. "It was always McDonald's or something like 
that . . . We had nothing to drink except when we ate." Because the guards 
would stop only infrequently to let the prisoners use the restroom, she said 
the men had to urinate in their soft drink cups. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Cantrell's fellow prisoners have corroborated parts of her story in 
letters written to her attorney, Carol Watson of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered if dogs get treated as bad," wrote David Long, one of the 
prisoners. "I started to get headaches because of the heat and if you drank 
liquids to help against the heat then the vibration and liquids would make you 
need to go to the restroom, which they wouldn't allow." 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were allowed to shower twice -- once in Yuma, Ariz., and again in 
Delta, Colo., when the prisoners were put up for the night in local jails. In 
Delta, Cantrell said she was startled when she heard keys drop while she was 
taking a shower. "I turned around and saw them there looking at me," she said 
of the guards. 
</P>
<P>
One prisoner, Wayne Osborne, wrote that one guard later bragged to the male 
inmates about seeing Cantrell in the shower. "He then made the statement to the 
other driver that he was gonna have to get him some from Marilyn before the 
trip ended, the older driver just smiled and said that sure would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Across Border 
</P>
<P>
The day after the stopover in Yuma, Ariz., the guards drove across the border 
into Nogales, Mexico, Cantrell said. Cantrell alleges that one of the guards, a 
blond Tennessean in his early 20s, bribed the border guard and then drove to a 
tiny Mexican police station. Several police officers were brought out to the 
van. 
</P>
<P>
"They got me out of the van and made me turn around in circles," she said, " . 
. . and they started bidding, joking around." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation was mostly in Spanish, but Cantrell said one of the prisoners 
later told her that the guards had tried to pimp her. "They tried to sell my 
body to pick up some extra cash," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The episode ended, Cantrell said, when an older policeman who she thought was 
the chief said in English: "No way. We're not getting mixed up in this." 
</P>
<P>
For the last part of the trip, Cantrell was put in the cab with the drivers 
because the van was overcrowded. She sat on a hard plastic ice chest placed 
between the bucket seats. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn wrote that one of the guards "would put his hands under Marilyn's blouse 
and feel her out. I could hear Marilyn begging him to please stop what he was 
doing . . . Marilyn was helpless against him." 
</P>
<P>
After picking up the last prisoner in McPherson, Kan., the guards drove north 
to Salina. Sheriff Darrell Wilson said all of the male prisoners were dropped 
off there to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women's Facilities 
</P>
<P>
"We had facilities for women," Wilson said, "but as best of my people can 
recall they never asked about putting a woman in our jail." 
</P>
<P>
Long wrote that when the male prisoners were dropped off the guards told them 
it was because they wanted to be alone with Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missouri, Cantrell alleges that 
while one of the guards drove westward toward Camdenton, Mo., the younger man 
climbed into the back of the van with her and assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
"After he had raped me, he put a gun to my head, forced me to look in his eyes 
and told me that if I ever told anybody he would kill me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The van reached Camdenton a little more than four hours later. There, the 
sheriff took her to a doctor because of back injuries she suffered from sitting 
for so long in an awkward position on the ice chest with no back support. She 
didn't tell local authorities right away about the rape, however. 
</P>
<P>
"After being in the van with the two guys that were supposed to be like 
representatives of law enforcement people . . . I was scared to talk to 
anybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After being given a court-appointed attorney, she pleaded guilty and was given 
five years probation on the check fraud charge. When she returned to 
California, she filed rape charges but action was held up for months because of 
confusion over jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Vehicle 
</P>
<P>
"We were never able to establish where and if that crime was committed," said 
Wilson, the sheriff in Salina. Because the alleged rape occurred in a moving 
vehicle en route from Salina to Camdenton, "there was a real problem with 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
The case was eventually turned over to the FBI, but their investigation has 
been stymied, Wilson said, because they have not yet located the two guards. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the employees left the agency and nobody knows how to 
locate them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When private extradition companies such as Extradition Corporation of America 
first came into existence, law enforcement officials interviewed said, they 
operated far differently than they do now. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Larry Whitten of Camden County, Mo., said his small county has used 
private firms for 11 years because it reduced the cost of extraditing prisoners 
by one-third. "When (the companies) first started they actually had planes and 
they flew people around the country," he said. Now the reported half-dozen or 
so private extradition firms use specially modified vans into which sometimes 
as many as 11 prisoners are crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying anything about the (rape) allegations," said Whitten, "but when 
they brought her in a vehicle that was overcrowded and caused her to sit on an 
ice chest that did some at-least temporary damage to her lower back, we decided 
that if we were going to be paying medical bills for things like this maybe we 
should start using our own people . . . I just think it's extending your 
liability. If you're starting to get complaints like this, you better quit." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Los Angeles, too, were concerned about the use of vans to 
transport prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned from the beginning about ground transportation being used 
over long distances," said Moore, the Los Angeles County extradition chief. 
"Maybe it would be fine to a bordering state, but to bring someone to Los 
Angeles you're going to be crossing a lot of desert. We're a long distance from 
almost anywhere they may be coming from." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escape Risks 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials also complain that, since there is no regulatory 
agency to oversee the performance of private extradition companies and the 
training of employees, the chances are greater of prisoner escapes. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Corrections first signed a short-term contract 
with Extradition Corporation of America in May, 1988, the same month the state 
canceled its contract with the previous extradition contractor because of three 
high-profile escapes, which occurred in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>
The last escape occurred April 10, 1988, slightly more than two weeks after the 
previous escape. Two guards employed by Interstate Extraditions, an 
Illinois-based firm, were transporting a man charged with rape, torture and 
murder from Iowa to Visalia in Tulare County in the central part of the state. 
The guards stopped at a convenience store in San Antonio to buy soft drinks, 
leaving the keys in the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
While they were in the store the murder suspect kicked out a window in the back 
of the van and crawled out. He then got into the cab of the van and drove off. 
Two blocks away, he used the keys to unlock his restraints and, after the other 
prisoners refused his offer of freedom, abandoned the vehicle to flee on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"There were three cases where there was a very definite breakdown," said 
Michael Van Winkle, the California Department of Corrections spokesman. "Not 
paying attention to the company's own policies and guidelines resulted in the 
inmates escaping." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Share of Escapes 
</P>
<P>
Extradition Corporation of America, the company hired to replace Interstate, 
also has had its share of high-profile escapes -- including one in 1987 where a 
prisoner overpowered his guards, commandeered a pickup truck and then shot 
himself in the head during a high-speed chase through Oregon. Also, the company 
currently has from 15 to 20 lawsuits pending against it alleging civil rights 
violations, according to Watson, Cantrell's Los Angeles attorney who has filed 
several of the lawsuits, including the two alleging rape. 
</P>
<P>
Van Winkle said the corrections department, which has paid the company $1.9 
million for services rendered since May of last year, recently signed a 
long-term contract that expires the last day of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
By contracting with a private extradition company, he said the state is able to 
save half a million dollars per year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more cost efficient," he said. "And it provides real benefits for the 
smaller counties that do a lot fewer extraditions than some of the larger 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of extraditing a prisoner is $900 if the state or a local law 
enforcement agency handles it, he said. If a private extradition company does 
it, it costs an average of $600. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to contracting with a private company, the state reimbursed counties for 
the costs of extraditing prisoners. Now, except in special circumstances, the 
counties have to use the company chosen by the state. Seventy-five percent of 
all California extraditions are performed by the private firm. The special 
circumstances include prisoners with known medical problems and prisoners that 
for some reason must be extradited quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profit Margins 
</P>
<P>
Because the companies are paid on a per-prisoner basis, critics say the 
companies increase their profit margins by loading in as many prisoners and 
making as many stops as possible. This sometimes means a prisoner spends days 
or weeks on the road in the crowded cages built into the vans. 
</P>
<P>
In California, "the main benefit is that if (a small county) does one 
extradition a year, sending one deputy by plane to New York could cost a 
thousand dollars," said Van Winkle of the corrections department. "Instead, if 
you put them on a bus with ECA that might be bringing back five or six or 11 
prisoners it would cost a lot less than reimbursing the costs of the county 
making individual arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
The state's contract with Extradition Corporation of America stipulates that 
the guards receive law enforcement training equivalent to that of a police 
officer and that each prisoner receive a "safe and secure" trip with three 
meals a day and restroom stops at least every three hours. The contract also 
stipulates that the prisoners must be kept in restraining devices at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the use of private companies complain, though, that the companies' 
compliance with such regulations are poorly monitored since no government 
agency has responsibility for regulating the firms. 
</P>
<P>
A clause in the state's contract allows the cancellation of the contract if it 
is determined that the company is doing a poor job, Van Winkle said.

PAUL GANN DIES; TAX-CRUSADING PROP. 13 AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Gann, the tax crusader who achieved nationwide attention as co-author of 
Proposition 13 in 1978 died Monday, almost two years after embarking on his 
final campaign. 
</P>
<P>
That one was against the AIDS virus, to which he was exposed during a blood 
transfusion after open heart surgery in 1982. He died at the Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Center in Sacramento, where he had been under treatment for a broken 
hip suffered in a Sept. 2 fall at his Carmichael home. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesman said Gann died from pneumonia, complicated by his battle 
against the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian called his fellow Republican "a tireless crusader in 
behalf of lower taxes, fiscal responsibility and good government. . . . He was 
a champion of the hard-working taxpayer and an outstanding American." And 
Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, whose powers Gann had once campaigned 
to curtail, credited the activist with playing "a major role in shaping 
California's government financing system for a dozen years. His passing will be 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend, Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), described Gann as 
"small in physical stature but huge in his impact on California. . . . He was 
the will of the common man, ignored by politicians, that rose up to challenge 
and defeat the inaction of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1987, in one of the most unusual press conferences in Sacramento 
history, Gann, normally a grandfatherly type who spoke softly in homilies, 
voiced his outrage over the tainted blood that had been given him. 
</P>
<P>
He told publicly and graphically how the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome had crippled him physically, and called for widespread 
testing to detect the always-fatal, infectious malady that strikes primarily at 
male homosexuals and intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of selfishly trying to protect ourselves by keeping secrets, we should 
be leading the fight to protect our friends and loved ones. . . ," he told the 
media. "We have to face it. There's no cure for AIDS. The only way to control 
it now is to find out who has it and let others know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teamed With Howard Jarvis 
</P>
<P>
Before launching his battle against AIDS, Gann had been known best for teaming 
with the blustery Howard Jarvis in 1977 to qualify the controversial initiative 
Proposition 13 for the ballot and for his individual efforts to keep the spirit 
of tax cutting alive. 
</P>
<P>
The two became famous by promising homeowners relief from drastically 
increasing property taxes. Fearful that the rising taxes would result in the 
loss of their homes, voters went to the polls and approved Proposition 13 by a 
margin of 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gann's life had been something of a roller coaster ride before Proposition 13 
catapulted him to fame. He came from a poor Arkansas family, suffered from a 
crippling disease for much of his early years and was a car and real estate 
salesman who twice went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
But, riding the tide of fame and glory bestowed on him by thankful taxpayers, 
Gann late in his life became the 1980 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
He also made a second career of using the initiative process to deal with what 
he said was a state government unresponsive to the voters interests. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Clark County, Ark., on June 12, 1912, Gann was one of 11 children. The 
son of a Nazarene preacher who farmed to support the family, Gann early on 
learned the Bible passages he was to use often during his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
At age 5, after his leg was crushed in a fall from a horse, he contracted a 
disease he would suffer from for the next 25 years. Osteomyelitis, an 
inflammation of the bone marrow, settled in his left leg, at times causing his 
knee to swell to the size of a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"His brothers and sisters had to pull him to grammar school in a wagon," Gann's 
daughter Linda Stone said. "He was a cripple." 
</P>
<P>
Gann's illness ultimately prevented him from attending public schools, and he 
was tutored at home by his mother. He completed high school through a 
correspondence course and later took law courses the same way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Autos, Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
In 1931 Gann married Nell Holloway and made a living picking peaches and doing 
construction work. During the Depression, Gann and his wife left Arkansas and 
moved to California, where he supported them by selling autos and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1940s, still suffering from the osteomyelitis, Gann went to a San 
Francisco hospital where he had 13 operations. Nell Gann said doctors resorted 
to putting maggots on the infected leg hoping they would eat away the 
osteomyelitis. When this failed, Gann's doctor gained permission to try a new 
drug, penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, he was cured. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gann) said his recovery from osteomyelitis was a miracle, and we gave God 
credit for his recovery," Nell Gann said. 
</P>
<P>
Registered as a Democrat, Gann started his political career in the 1950s. By 
then he had four children and was earning a living selling cars and real estate 
while doing volunteer work in Democratic presidential primaries. He also 
mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the City Council in Modesto, where he 
lived for 13 years before moving to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
His first bankruptcy was the result of investing virtually all his money in 
military surplus items for resale after World War II. But, his wife said, the 
items did not reach him until after consumer demand was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Gann again filed bankruptcy in 1964 as a result of a long court case in which 
Volvo of America Corp. challenged the ownership of a dealership Gann had 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret those things happened," Nell Gann said, "but I will never hold my 
head down because of it." Interviewed before her husband's death, she said he 
would often say, "You are never defeated if you get knocked down, it's if you 
don't get up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Switched to Republicans 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s Gann changed his party affiliation from Democrat to 
Republican to, in his words, "better help the people of California." He took up 
those issues he felt affected taxpayers statewide. By now retired, Gann's first 
signature drive was in 1974 to demonstrate public opposition to what his 
supporters said was a generous pension plan for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
To supply a vehicle for political involvement at the local level, Gann founded 
the People's Advocate in 1974. Gann was its president when he teamed up with 
Jarvis in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis, as president of the United Organization of Taxpayers, and Gann had 
tried individually to place property tax-cutting initiatives on the ballot 
before 1977. After each had failed, they decided to work together. 
</P>
<P>
Their drastic personality differences made it more productive for them to 
handle separate aspects of the Proposition 13 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gann and his organization established local committees that rang doorbells and 
used telephones to get out the vote. Jarvis handled publicity and coordinated 
radio and television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
After their overwhelming ballot victory, Gann, a benign man with a down-home 
way of approaching people, noted that he had been overshadowed by the 
fast-talking, loud-mouthed Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis, who died in 1986, admitted he was the one most often in the limelight, 
adding, "Paul had a right to feel slighted somewhat," but "it didn't cause any 
bitterness between us." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after the success of the initiative, the two had a bitter falling out, 
Gann charging that Jarvis was trying to claim all the credit for the success of 
Proposition 13. Gann and Jarvis later mended their disagreements and went on to 
endorse each other's endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
After Proposition 13, Gann struck out alone on the initiative path. Already in 
his late 60s, Gann took a story of over-taxation and legislative overspending 
to the people and attracted many to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doing What Had to Be Done 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 Gann told The Times he was only doing what had to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The people shouldn't have to go around with petitions creating laws, but if 
the Legislature won't, we will," Gann said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a patriot. I care about the people and about my country. I'd fight like a 
dog for our rights." 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Gann campaigned for the "Spirit of 13" initiative that placed 
constitutional limits on government spending in the state. The initiative, 
Proposition 4 on the ballot, was passed by 3-1 majority in the November, 1979, 
state election. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1980, proclaiming the need to balance the federal budget and limit the 
power of government, the grass-roots activist defeated six other Republican 
challengers to become the party's candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Running against then two-term incumbent Alan Cranston, Gann was pegged as a 
one-issue candidate with little knowledge of anything but tax-cutting 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Gann spent just over $1 million during the campaign, compared to the nearly $3 
million Cranston spent, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission said. 
But, more important, in the crucial days before the election Gann ran 
completely out of funds and had to depend on radio and television talk shows 
for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston easily won the race with 56.5% of the votes compared to Gann's 37%. 
</P>
<P>
After the election Gann immediately went back to tackling what he viewed as 
government inadequacies with his Victims Bill of Rights initiative, Proposition 
8 on the June, 1982, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tide of Public Sentiment 
</P>
<P>
Riding a tide of public sentiment that held that lawmakers were soft on crime 
and that the courts coddled criminals, Proposition 8 amended the state 
Constitution to make criminal convictions easier, adding five sections to the 
Penal Code and three sections to the Health and Institution Code. The 
initiative was approved by 56% of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Then again using the power of direct democracy, Gann challenged lawmakers with 
his Legislative Reform Act in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
This initiative, which qualified for the June, 1984, ballot, called for a 
drastic 30% cut in the Legislature's budget and reduction of the power held by 
the Assembly Speaker. It was approved by the voters but thrown out by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Gann campaigned for all his propositions with the vigor of men half his age. 
Even the five-bypass open heart operation in 1982 that was to result in his 
exposure to the AIDS virus, and intestinal surgery for blocked arteries in 
November, 1983, failed to slow him appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, he proposed legislation that would eliminate some of the 
property tax inequities created by his own Proposition 13. But thereafter he 
lost those scrapping abilities as AIDS weakened him. When he first disclosed 
that he was infected by the virus, he said he at first lost 10 pounds in as 
many days and could not eat or stand properly. 
</P>
<P>
But, for a time, he improved, attributing what proved only to be a brief 
recovery to his getting over "the anger and frustration." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I was born to die. I'm going to die someday," he said at that fateful 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm going to tell you one thing. (I'm) going to put up an awful fight 
because I'm going to hang on and fight back, and I will be doing what I've been 
doing for years until the day I can no longer get out of bed and move around 
and call people."

4 POPULAR CONDOMS LEAK AIDS VIRUS IN CLINICAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four of the nation's most popular condom brands permitted the AIDS virus to 
escape in laboratory tests conducted for UCLA, prompting researchers to warn 
users they should not assume that all condoms work equally well in preventing 
spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the AIDS virus leaked in one of the 10 condoms 
tested in each of three brands, and six of 25 tested in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance of using a defective condom is small," the study concluded, but the 
laboratory results "suggest that all condoms may not be equally effective in 
preventing (AIDS) transmission." 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion conflicts with a key element of the federal government's 
AIDS-prevention strategy, which assumed that all condoms blocked the 
transmission of the AIDS virus with equal effectiveness. The government has 
emphasized condom use without regard to possible differences among brands. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-page report of the federally funded study, obtained Monday by The 
Times under the Freedom of Information Act, also listed 10 top-ranked condom 
brands that performed well in a wide variety of laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, among the thousands of condoms tested, the study found that 0.66% of 
condoms -- more than one of every 200 -- failed, either allowing water or air 
to escape, breaking in tensile strength tests or leaking the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers called for more effective condom-safety programs by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration -- with inspectors taking samples from retail 
store shelves instead of factory stocks. But in a final report of the UCLA 
study, they emphasized that "the use of even the lowest-scoring condom we 
tested is preferable to not using a condom for disease prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Release of the report by the government's National Institute on Child Health 
and Human Development was scheduled for last April but was delayed several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Tests for ability to prevent leakage of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
which causes AIDS, were separate from a broader laboratory evaluation of condom 
effectiveness, in which hundreds of condoms of each of 31 different brands were 
tested. However, eight of the 10 top names in the wider laboratory tests also 
were tested for leakage of the AIDS virus, and none leaked. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the condom brands tested are made of latex rubber. But the AIDS 
virus tests also included one brand, Fourex Natural Skins, made of lamb 
membrane -- a material whose AIDS-prevention ability had been questioned in 
earlier studies. 
</P>
<P>
In the UCLA study, however, researchers at the Los Angeles-based Mariposa 
Foundation, a partner in the research, were unable to detect AIDS virus leakage 
in 25 lambskin condoms in a test designed to simulate stresses in sex. The 
report concluded that concern about the AIDS safety of lambskin condoms, which 
some users prefer in the belief they are more resistant to breakage than latex 
products, "is open to question." 
</P>
<P>
The latex rubber condoms that permitted the AIDS virus to escape -- either 
through pinholes, tears or pores in the rubber membrane -- included the 
Lifestyles Conture, made by Ansell Americas, the Trojan Naturalube and Trojan 
Ribbed, made by Carter-Wallace, and the Contracept Plus, manufactured by 
National Sanitary Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
The Contracept Plus test (in which six of the 25 leaked) was based on a batch 
of condoms that had deteriorated badly during wholesale storage, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The top-10 ranking was dominated by products manufactured by Schmid 
Laboratories, which markets the Ramses and Sheik condom brands, and Circle 
Rubber Corp., which makes such products as Gold Circle, Gold Circle Coin and 
Pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA report found the Mentor brand to be apparently the highest-ranking. 
However, because the Mentor Corp. changed the manufacturer of the condom it 
markets after the UCLA testing was completed, researchers said the ranking was 
open to question. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Ansell Americas could not be reached for comment and a spokesman 
for Carter-Wallace said officials could not comment on the report because they 
had not seen it. Norman Estrin, vice president of the Health Industry 
Manufacturers Assn., a Washington-based trade group representing the condom 
industry, questioned the validity of the UCLA results. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think you can distinguish brands on the basis of these 
studies," Estrin said. "I think it would be a mistake to purchase condoms based 
on any kind of rankings. All of these brands meet FDA standards and the 
consumer should have confidence in condoms as an aid in protecting people 
against HIV infection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CONDOMS AND LEAKAGE OF THE AIDS VIRUS 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA condom study subjected 14 condom brands to additional tests to 
specifically determine if they would permit leakage of the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Tests were conducted among the eight brands of 
latex rubber condoms that scored highest in the study's initial ranking of 31 
brands and the five latex brands that scored lowest. One brand of natural 
lambskin condoms -- Fourex Natural Skins -- was also tested to determine if 
that material allows passage of the AIDS virus. Tests were conducted on 10 
condoms of each brand using a machine that simulates the stresses of actual 
intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
All eight of the high-ranking brands successfully prevented passage of the AIDS 
virus. They are: 
</P>
<P>
Mentor** (Mentor Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
Ramses Non-Lubricated (Schmid Laboratories) 
</P>
<P>
Ramses Sensitol (Schmid Laboratories) 
</P>
<P>
Gold Circle Coin (Circle Rubber) 
</P>
<P>
Gold Circle (Circle Rubber) 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Elite (Schmid Laboratories) 
</P>
<P>
Durex Nuform (Schmid Laboratories) 
</P>
<P>
Pleaser (Circle Rubber) 
</P>
<P>
Four of five of the lowest-ranking brands in the original survey leaked the 
AIDS virus. They are: 
</P>
<P>
Lifestyles Conture (Ansell Americas) 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Naturalube (Carter Wallace) 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Ribbed (Carter Wallace) 
</P>
<P>
Contracept Plus*** (National Sanitary Laboratories) 
</P>
<P>
The fifth brand, Lifestyles Nuda (Ansell Americas), showed no AIDS virus 
leakage. 
</P>
<P>
The study tested 25 Fourex Natural Skins (Schmid Laboratories) condoms, but 
none showed any evidence of leakage. 
</P>
<P>
NOTES: 
</P>
<P>
* Score is average of scores for three separate batches of condoms subjected to 
extensive laboratory tests. Score is on a scale of 0 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
** The distributor of the Mentor condom changed its manufacturer after the UCLA 
research was conducted. The test results do not reflect performance of the 
current condom sold under the Mentor name. 
</P>
<P>
*** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a recall of the batch of 
Contracept Plus condoms used in the research after UCLA scientists notified the 
FDA of a massive failure rate, in which six of 25 Contracept Plus condoms 
permitted passage of HIV. The other three brands had failures in one of 10 
condoms tested.

STATE REPORT FINDS MASSIVE ASBESTOS PERIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A state task force on the dangers of asbestos in public buildings has concluded 
that the cancer-causing material poses significant problems in most government 
facilities in California and that the cost of reducing exposure to workers and 
the public may run as high as $660 million, according to a report obtained by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The alarming findings are based on inspections of 250 government buildings 
scattered across the state, including hospitals, police and fire stations, 
airports, libraries and courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found asbestos-containing material in more than 80% of city and 
county buildings they sampled. In 60% of the structures, the asbestos was in a 
form that could crumble easily, sending its lung-damaging fibers into the air. 
</P>
<P>
In 42% of the buildings, the potential health risk was severe enough that the 
task force recommended that the asbestos be removed or treated within a year -- 
and in some cases within six months. The task force also found less frequent 
but still significant problems in privately owned offices leased by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies have been notified about the asbestos problems in each of 
the buildings included in the sample, according to the report. And some have 
taken emergency steps to prevent asbestos exposure. 
</P>
<P>
However, the purpose of the study -- ordered by the Legislature in 1986 -- was 
to estimate the extent of the asbestos problem in about 40,000 government 
buildings and offices throughout the state and to determine the best way to go 
about the slow, expensive process of removing or repairing the material. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of its findings, the task force "urges all cities and counties to 
begin an inspection program as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), author of the 1986 legislation, is 
angry that the Administration of Gov. George Deukmejian has taken so long to 
complete the study, which is almost two years overdue and still has not been 
released officially. The study was conducted by a private consultant under 
contract to the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged at the delay in this report and angered by the Administration's 
resistance to letting this information be made public and allow a cleanup to 
proceed in a rational fashion," Margolin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The task force report makes sweeping recommendations for rating the health risk 
posed by asbestos in different situations and advises government officials on 
how to identify problems that require emergency removal. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said that he was surprised by the extent of the problem identified in 
the study. "I'm even more surprised by the state's slowness to act." 
</P>
<P>
The completed asbestos report is still awaiting approval by the governor's 
office before it can be officially released, said Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's 
deputy press secretary, who said he could not comment on the delay in 
completing the study. The governor's office received the lengthy report only on 
Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered a near total ban 
on the manufacture or import of asbestos-containing products by 1996. Among the 
items affected by the ban are automobile brakes, concrete pipes and roofing 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is one of a relatively small number of substances proved to cause 
cancer, not just in animals, but in humans. It can also cause chronic, 
debilitating lung disease among those exposed to its microscopic fibers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban Would Not Be Total 
</P>
<P>
Even an outright ban would not eliminate asbestos exposure because so much of 
the material has been used over the years for a variety of purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its resistance to heat and fire, asbestos was used in materials for 
wrapping pipes and boilers and in ceiling and floor tiles. Removing material 
from buildings can itself be a source of asbestos exposure if the cleanup is 
not done carefully. 
</P>
<P>
The state task force found the most frequent asbestos problems in buildings 
constructed before 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The group's report estimates that it will cost $31 million to conduct a 
complete building-by-building survey of city, county and state-leased 
facilities. Surveys of state-owned facilities -- including state office 
buildings and university campuses -- have already been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommended that government agencies begin by attacking the 
problem where the risk of exposure of workers and the public is highest. The 
group recommended that priority be given to police offices and medical 
facilities, which are used around the clock and where inspections turned up 
especially high levels of crumbling or damaged asbestos material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Left in Place 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, asbestos-containing material could be safely left in place if 
regularly inspected, maintained and labeled, the task force concluded. The 
group recommended establishing a statewide register of government buildings to 
keep track of cleanup and maintenance efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the task force report obtained by The Times does not include the 
results of inspections of each building in the statewide sample, those findings 
were released to individual government agencies last year. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, for example, 20 of 56 government buildings in the survey 
were found to require immediate asbestos removal. Among the county facilities 
that required emergency action were Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey, 
the Lynwood sheriff's substation, and the Los Cerritos Municipal Court building 
in Bellflower. After a story on the contamination problems appeared in The 
Times, the county supervisors ordered emergency action to eliminate any risk to 
workers or the public in those facilities.

ELKS LODGE TO RECONSIDER ADMITTING 2 BLACKS 
</P>

<P>
Joe Martin and Ernest Hutchinson applied for membership in the Lompoc Elks 
Lodge about six months ago. Both were rejected because they are black. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the Elks again will consider the applications of Martin and Hutchinson. 
But this time, both men are expected to be voted in. 
</P>
<P>
The Lompoc Elks have not changed, but their voting methods have. As a result of 
the controversy after the rejection of the two men, the Elks have changed 
voting guidelines in lodges nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, it took only three opposing votes for a prospective member to be 
rejected. So although the majority of the 1,700 members in the Lompoc lodge 
voted to accept Martin and Hutchinson, a handful of members were able to keep 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
"This three-vote blackball system has definitely been used to keep out 
minorities," said Gary Stanley, a Lompoc optician who first sponsored Martin 
for membership. "This was the good old boy system." 
</P>
<P>
But in July, during the annual Elks convention, the national membership 
approved a proposal by the Lompoc lodge to change the voting system. Now, a 
two-thirds majority can approve new lodge members. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that no matter where you go you're going to run into people who have 
prejudice," Martin said. "But at least now, those people aren't going to have 
all the say." 
</P>
<P>
Although Martin and Hutchinson are expected to be approved, there still is a 
faction of Elks who actively oppose them, said Bruce Shumer, a Lompoc real 
estate businessman who first sponsored Hutchinson for membership. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody out there has been making anonymous phone calls to members telling 
them: 'We have to show up at the meeting and vote to keep these people out.' I 
don't think they'll succeed. But, unfortunately, there is still a racist 
sentiment out there." 
</P>
<P>
The four Elks lodges in Santa Barbara County have more than 7,500 members. But 
only the small Santa Ynez lodge has a black member. 
</P>
<P>
When Martin and Hutchinson were first rejected about six months ago, many in 
the community were especially outraged because both are community leaders and 
were considered ideal candidates. The lodge's six-man investigating committee, 
which does background checks and interviews all prospective members, 
unanimously recommended the two men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divided Group 
</P>
<P>
But a small group of Elks conspired to keep out all blacks, members said, and 
they voted against Martin and Hutchinson. The rejection created a controversy 
that divided the fraternal organization and the community. 
</P>
<P>
More than 25 Elks members resigned and about 100 withheld their annual dues in 
protest. Numerous organizations in Lompoc severed relations with the Elks, and 
the California attorney general's office investigated the lodge for possible 
civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are rejected again, that will be the death knell for the lodge in 
Lompoc," said James Huseman, who resigned from the Elks because of the 
controversy. "People around here already have withdrawn a lot of support for 
the lodge, and it will take years for the community to get over this." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 56, a decorated Air Force veteran who served in Korea and Vietnam, now 
sells real estate and is active in a number of community organizations. 
Hutchinson, 57, a Santa Barbara County Housing Authority official, was a Lompoc 
policeman for eight years and is a past president of the Lions Club and a board 
member of the local American Legion chapter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'White Gentlemen' Rule 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kind of people you'd think organizations would be eager to have 
as members," said Smiley Wilkins, president of the Lompoc branch of the NAACP. 
"It puts a cloud over the whole organization to treat them like second-class 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
A national Elks rule requiring all lodge members to be "white gentlemen" was 
abolished in 1973. But women are still prohibited from joining. 
</P>
<P>
At the Elks 125th annual convention in July, members again voted to keep the 
organization all-male.

TEXAS IN SPOTLIGHT AS GOP PUTS FOCUS ON WRIGHT SEAT

Last-minute campaigning was the order of the day in Texas Monday for a special 
election today to fill the House seat left open by Democratic Rep. Jim Wright, 
one of a smattering of special and primary elections being held in about a 
half-dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
Other contests on tap include mayoral primary battles in Detroit; Buffalo, 
N.Y.; St. Paul, Minn.; Toledo, Ohio, and New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans focused their efforts on the Texas election in the hope of chipping 
into the Democrats' 255-176 edge in the House. Republican Bob Lanier, a 
television medical commentator, appears to have a slight edge over Democrat 
Pete Geren in a district where Wright, a former Speaker of the House who left 
office in an ethics scandal, is extremely popular. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, Democratic Mayor Coleman A. Young is trying to brush off challenges 
to his bid for a record fifth term in office. 
</P>
<P>
His challengers include Rep. John Conyers Jr., a brash 12-term Democratic 
congressman who says that Young has been in office too long. Conyers, who like 
Young is black, has benefited from the vocal support of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 
who exhorted a crowd on Monday to "keep hope alive" by voting for Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
The top two vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 7 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates are battling to succeed St. Paul Mayor George Latimer, who is 
quitting after 12 years in office to become a law school dean. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo Mayor James Griffin is assured of appearing on the November ballot. The 
maverick Democrat, who is being challenged by two other candidates in the 
Democratic primary, is also running unopposed for both the Republican and 
Conservative party nominations. 
</P>
<P>
In New Haven, state Sen. John Daniels is trying to become the first black mayor 
of the mostly white Connecticut city. Daniels is locked in a tough fight with 
John DeStefano Jr., the hand-picked candidate of Mayor Biagio DiLieto, who is 
retiring.

Accused Colombian drug financier Eduardo Martinez Romero was ordered jailed 
without bail Monday after he pleaded innocent to charges of laundering huge 
sums of cocaine money that led to his extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman, in denying a request that Martinez be held 
under house arrest rather than his current solitary confinement, ruled that 
defense lawyers failed to answer government arguments that he could resume 
supervising money laundering for the Medellin drug cartel and should be 
regarded as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is the first accused Colombian drug figure extradited to the United 
States since his country's anti-drug crackdown began more than three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the defendant had never been charged with a crime, was a government 
budget director and is a family man, Feldman emphasized that money laundering 
"oils the machine" of drug distribution and is more serious than a mere series 
of alleged illegal financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Martinez is accused of laundering at least $15 million in U.S. 
banks and of being the financial expert behind efforts to hide $1.2 billion in 
drug profits earned by the Medellin cartel, which is believed responsible for 
80% of the cocaine smuggled into this country. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was extradited from Colombia under heavy guard last Thursday. His 
lawyer had objected that a U.S. court has no jurisdiction over him. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez could receive life in prison under U.S. law, compared to 30 years 
under Colombian law.

SENATE REPORT CITES U.S. INTELLIGENCE GAPS ON COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
U.S. anti-drug agencies suffer from "large gaps" in their knowledge of how the 
Colombian cocaine cartels operate, and even when important information is 
obtained, it is not used effectively, a Senate report obtained Monday 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The report of the Republican staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs permanent 
investigations subcommittee, which began its inquiry a year ago, charged that 
U.S. efforts resemble the "body count" approach during the Vietnam War -- 
emphasizing drugs seized and arrests made rather than strategic intelligence 
about the cartel organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't win the war on drugs if we don't know the enemy," said Sen. William 
V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.), the subcommittee's ranking minority member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings Start Today 
</P>
<P>
The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, is to be released at the 
opening of hearings today at which officials of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration and FBI are scheduled to be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a veteran FBI official warned in a hearing Monday that the United 
States would not be able to prevent counterattacks by Colombian cartels if they 
chose to carry the battle to this country. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the resources to even attack the drug-trafficking activities of 
these organizations, much less assure (that) they will not engage in acts of 
violence and retribution," said Oliver B. Revell, associate deputy director of 
investigations for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was intent on the part of these cartels to have blood running on the 
streets of America, I don't think we would be in the position to preempt it," 
Revell told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The warning of intelligence failures by the permanent investigations 
subcommittee takes on special significance because of U.S. attempts to bolster 
the fight against the cartels being waged by Colombian President Virgilio Barco 
Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Colombia's government is battling "for its very life in full-scale 
war against the entrenched armies of the drug cartels," Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
the subcommittee chairman, said: "Unfortunately, we are still a long way from 
having the type of detailed intelligence we need to successfully combat their 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee investigators said they found within U.S. agencies "very widely 
divergent views on the organizational structure and operations of the 
international cocaine cartel." In a regional office of one agency, which the 
report did not name, three agents, each with extensive South American 
experience, "offered three widely disparate views" on how the cartels are 
organized and operated. 
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the lack of consensus on two primary factors -- insufficient 
effort to collect and analyze information that is available and the reluctance 
of agencies to share information, particularly that which is obtained from 
confidential informants. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the available knowledge about drug-trafficking organizations is never 
reported or recorded in any official channel," the report said. "It is stored 
in the heads and desks of hundreds of U.S. agents and officials both in the 
United States and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee investigators also blamed the intelligence gap on the absence of 
any single entity charged with collecting and analyzing drug-related strategic 
intelligence. They cited the Administration's consideration of establishing 
such a center "a good first step." 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the two major cartels in Colombia are the Medellin and 
the Cali, with the smaller Cali organization appearing to function in a more 
businesslike and less violent fashion than the Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Secondary trafficking groups -- such as the North Coast organization -- provide 
such services as storage facilities, landing strips and safe staging and 
departure areas to the larger organizations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report identified transportation as one of the traffickers' most vulnerable 
areas, with many of the pilots being U.S. citizens who are often brought to 
Colombia to meet the cartel bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"This reliance on non-Colombians as pilots seems anomalous in organizations 
which otherwise rely on family members or trusted associates from their region 
of Colombia," the investigators noted. "But (it) is necessary because American 
pilots have better technical know-how and skill and they are more familiar with 
U.S. terrain." 
</P>
<P>
The investigators pointed to Mexico as a popular transshipment point for 
U.S.-destined cocaine and said there are "thousands of landing strips in the 
desert areas around Los Angeles" that are used to bring the cocaine across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
A customs official offered this profile of a typical ground crew that is paid 
to handle a cocaine shipment: "One person sitting in a lawn chair in the middle 
of the desert near an empty riverbed. Attached to the lawn chair is a sock, 
which indicates wind direction. Parked nearby is a Winnebago or some other 
large transportation vehicle."

BRITAIN'S ANTI-DRUG PACKAGE BEING PREPARED FOR COLOMBIA

Britain is preparing an anti-drug package for Colombia that will coincide with 
U.S. efforts to assist the Latin American country's crackdown on drug 
traffickers, British Foreign Secretary John Major told President Bush on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mainly training and technical assistance. It will certainly also deal 
with protection of personnel," Major told reporters as he emerged from White 
House meetings with Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Major, 46, making his first call on the White House since taking over from 
Geoffrey Howe as foreign minister in July, said British officials were in 
Bogota in the last few days trying to determine what needs to be done to 
bolster President Virgilio Barco Vargas' battle against the drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come up with a package of assistance that we think we can offer," he 
said. "I hope we'll be able to proceed with that very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Major said he was unable to provide a dollar figure on the aid package because 
details have not yet been completed. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we're trying to find out what the Colombians need so we can 
dovetail with the assistance that the President has announced from here," Major 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has said it is giving Colombia $65 million in emergency aid, 
most of it military hardware, to help fight drug traffickers who supply 80% of 
the cocaine used illegally in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Colombia along with Peru and Bolivia would get $250 million under 
a $7.86-billion anti-drug package Bush announced last week.

NO 'VIETNAM' IN COLOMBIA, U.S. STRESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House asserted Monday that the deployment of U.S. military advisers 
to Colombia will not become "another Vietnam situation" or lead to a "massive 
troop buildup" that draws the United States into a shooting war overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging critics' concerns that American military personnel could become 
involved in Colombian drug raids, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said that the 30 advisers are there only to provide training and will let the 
Colombians do the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "their orders are the same orders that our forces anywhere in the 
world have and that is that they have the right to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is risk associated with U.S. forces there at any time," he said, adding: 
"Colombia is a very dangerous place to be these days." 
</P>
<P>
The stepped-up efforts by the United States and Colombia to stem the illegal 
flow of cocaine from Colombia to U.S. drug markets has been met with an 
increase in violence there. On Monday, a former mayor of Medellin, a center of 
the Colombian drug trade, was assassinated by masked gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Combat Role Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
President Bush reiterated the Administration's insistence that no combat role 
is foreseen for the U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who met with British Foreign Secretary John Major and reviewed 
Britain's plans to provide "training and technical assistance" to Colombia, 
said in a speech: 
</P>
<P>
"There is no contemplation of the . . . use of American armed forces in any 
combat role there. No U.S. military personnel will accompany host government 
forces on actual field operations. Our personnel will provide training, 
equipment and operational support as we have been asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I will see that it works, just exactly that way," the President insisted. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done repeatedly since he unveiled his anti-drug plan a week ago, Bush 
continued in his public appearances to try to drum up support for his drug war 
strategy. He used a ceremony marking the 200th anniversary of the Treasury 
Department as a platform to pledge that "we are going to track every lead that 
we receive from whatever source to separate the drug barons from the drug 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Involvement Possible? 
</P>
<P>
The dispatch of the troops to advise Colombians raised questions about whether 
the deployment would become a first step toward greater U.S. military 
involvement in South America. Such questions were given added urgency in recent 
days with the disclosure that a National Security Decision Directive signed by 
Bush would allow the troops to train Colombians in areas beyond their base 
camps -- a move that presumably would increase the risk that they could come 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, speaking with reporters, said: 
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in not letting misinformation get out about this use, and 
there's a lot of people who are trying to portray this as another Vietnam 
situation or the beginning of a massive troop buildup and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration wants "to knock down" such an impression. The bitter 
U.S. military involvement in Vietnam began with the deployment of small numbers 
of advisers intended to counsel Saigon's troops in their guerrilla war with the 
Communist-led Viet Cong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Expanded Military Role 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said that any expanded role for the U.S. military in the drug 
fight in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia would require an additional National 
Security Decision Directive -- the classified paperwork ordering the Pentagon 
to act on the President's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, portraying a limited role for the advisers in Columbia, said, 
"My understanding is that our support is related to the operation and 
maintenance of the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The flow of U.S. military gear to Colombia, announced in August by the White 
House, is well under way, Bush suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we've supplied over $10-million worth of equipment, 10 aircraft, five 
UH-1 helicopters, an assortment of jeeps, ambulances and armor," Bush said at 
the Treasury Department. "Sixteen members of the American armed forces are in 
Colombia to oversee the supply operation and provide training." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The supplies are being sent under a $65-million emergency assistance program in 
the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition, Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia would receive $261 million in military and law enforcement assistance 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said that the United States is "working with the Colombian judiciary 
to increase the physical safety of judges and other members of the judicial 
system, and that includes security training as well as the delivery of armored 
cars and vests and communications equipment already under way." 
</P>
<P>
After a week of public debate over the President's plan, White House officials 
were upbeat over the outcome. They expressed optimism that Democrats' 
complaints that the spending is insufficient is not catching fire with the 
public.

MINORITIES SHOW GAINS IN 1989 NATIONAL SAT AVERAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Average national scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test this year were almost 
the same as in the previous three years but remain significantly lower than 
those of 20 years ago, according to statistics released Monday by the College 
Board in New York. 
</P>
<P>
However, College Board officials stressed that performances on the influential 
college entrance examinations by blacks, Asians and Mexican-Americans have 
improved substantially over the last decade, even though these minorities still 
lag behind whites in how well they do. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the average score for all groups on this year's verbal portion of 
the test fell one point from last year to 427. The score of 476 on the 
mathematical part was unchanged. Scores on either portion of the test range 
from a possible low of 200 to a high of 800 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Point Lower 
</P>
<P>
In the verbal SAT, men on average scored 434, compared to 421 for women, both a 
point lower than the year before. In math, men garnered 500 points on average, 
up two points, while women scored 454, down one point. 
</P>
<P>
In California, students this year scored 422 points on the verbal SAT, down two 
points from last year, and 484 on the math part, the same as in 1988. Those 
averages have remained fairly constant over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Women and minorities long have alleged that the SATs are biased in favor of 
white men. The College Board, the education organization that designs the 
tests, denies those allegations and says the gap between white men and other 
groups reflect high school preparation more than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"Inequities still exist in the educational opportunities available to 
students," College Board President Donald M. Stewart said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decline in Scores 
</P>
<P>
Critics of today's schools stress that the average total SAT score in 1969 was 
956, which is 53 points higher than this year's score. They blame the decline 
on loosening curriculum standards. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, College Board officials are focusing on the achievements of 
minorities over the last 10 years. In 1989, blacks on average scored 351 in the 
verbal test, 21 points higher than in 1979, and 386 in math, 28 points higher. 
At the same time, the average scores of Asian-Americans increased 13 points to 
409 in verbal and 14 points to 525 in math. Mexican-Americans were up 11 points 
in verbal to 381 and 20 points in math to 430. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the increases, the test scores for whites remained markedly higher, 
for the most part. The average scores this year for whites nationally were 446 
in verbal, up two points over the decade, and 491 in math, up eight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Success Story' 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said the overall lack of 
improvement in California "conceals a significant success story," that of 
higher scores by minorities. Since 1984, the total average score of blacks in 
California has increased 29 points to 760. The average score of Asians in the 
state is up 16 points to 904 and Latino scores are up 14 points to 806. During 
the same period, white totals went up 16 points to 956. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're making good, steady progress," Honig said Monday. He also 
stressed that 45% of California students taking the SATs come from minority 
groups, compared to 25% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 1989 results of the American College Testing Assessments, which 
also were released Monday, mirrored the same small overall change recorded by 
the SAT, its larger rival. The national composite ACT score in English, math, 
social studies and natural sciences was 18.6, down slightly from the 18.8 of 
the year before. ACT, which has very little presence in California, also showed 
evidence that the scores of minorities have improved in the last decade.

REAGAN MAY LEAVE HOSPITAL BY END OF WEEK, AIDE SAYS

Former President Ronald Reagan read newspapers Monday as he continued his 
recovery from skull surgery and spoke by telephone with the chairman-designate 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have not decided when to release the 78-year-old former President from 
St. Marys Hospital, where he underwent surgery Friday to remove fluid that had 
accumulated on the surface of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
But "physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful that, if the 
present rate of progress continues, (he) will be able to return to California 
at the end of the week," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement 
issued by the Mayo Clinic, which runs St. Marys. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after noon, President Reagan spoke with Gen. Colin Powell, 
chairman-designate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who telephoned over the 
weekend to extend his good wishes," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a buildup of 
blood. Doctors said the problem stemmed from a July 4 incident in which Reagan 
was tossed from a bucking horse and hit his head. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's neurosurgeon, Thoralf M. Sundt, told the New York Times on Sunday that 
a brain clot had been detected earlier but that it had healed on its own 
without surgery. Sundt said that the first clot was smaller and in a different 
area of Reagan's brain than was operated on Friday. Because of the first clot, 
brain tests were included as part of a regular checkup at the Mayo Clinic.

The horseback-riding accident that doctors believe produced the blood clot 
removed from former President Ronald Reagan's brain last Friday caused a 
similar but smaller clot last July that disappeared without surgery, Reagan's 
doctor has disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Monday's New York Times, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, chief 
neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic and the head of the team caring for Reagan, 
said that the earlier clot had shown up in medical tests performed in Los 
Angeles several days after the accident, which occurred July 4 on a Mexican 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors watched the clot, called a subdural hematoma, in periodic brain tests 
until it disappeared spontaneously, Sundt told the New York Times. Sundt could 
not be reached Monday, but Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg confirmed the report. 
</P>
<P>
Because the clot had developed after the July head injury, Reagan's doctors at 
Mayo recommended repeating the brain test, called a CAT scan, as part of his 
routine physical examination last week to make sure the problem had not 
recurred, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, 78, who is recuperating at St. Mary's Hospital, a Mayo Foundation 
hospital in Rochester, Minn., has reportedly received hundreds of cards and 
messages from well-wishers. He is continuing to make an excellent recovery from 
last week's surgery and may be able to return to California at the end of this 
week, according to a statement issued by Weinberg Monday afternoon.

FOR HAING NGOR, SORROW MARKS A RETURN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 17, Haing Ngor, winner of an Academy Award for his role in "The Killing 
Fields," stepped off a plane in Phnom Penh and saw his homeland for the first 
time since 1979, when he fled the brutal rule of the Communist Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the capital city, there were happy moments, such as his 
reunion with a younger brother he had not seen in 15 years. But mainly, what he 
saw saddened him. 
</P>
<P>
"My people is very, very poor," he said, recalling the sun-baked rice fields on 
the outskirts of the city, dirty streets, poor public hygiene, and the single 
traffic light in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns With Dith Pran 
</P>
<P>
His return to Cambodia with Dith Pran, the photographer whom he portrayed in 
the film, at the invitation of Hun Sen, leader of the current Vietnam-backed 
Communist regime, made Ngor even more determined to devote his life to freeing 
his countrymen from the legacy of foreign occupation and Khmer Rouge 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge, a radical Communist faction, terrorized 
Cambodia, killing at least 2 million residents, Ngor said in an interview 
Sunday, three days after he returned from Cambodia. He lost his wife, unborn 
child, and other family members during that nightmarish period before escaping 
to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
In Phnom Penh, Ngor's tearful reunion with his brother was filled with sadness 
and joy. Ngor, now 43, took the shirt off his back to give to his brother. 
While markets in Phnom Penh are stocked with produce, Thai radios and consumer 
goods, most Cambodians such as his brother are too poor to afford much, Ngor 
said. He also made arrangements to build an elementary school in his home 
village, Samrong Yong, as well as a hospital in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, where "The Killing Fields" has been shown, Ngor is as much a 
celebrity as he is elsewhere in the world. He was often recognized on Phnom 
Penh's streets. But those who ventured to speak to him did not want his 
autograph or a handshake. Instead, they simply told him the movie made them cry 
and helped release some of their own pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
After rocketing to stardom four years ago for his portrayal of Pran, a 
Cambodian journalist who survived Khmer Rouge rule, Ngor has worked ceaselessly 
on behalf of Cambodian and other refugees, especially the children. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up a copy of his new book, "Oublies," or "The Forgotten," which he 
wrote in French, Ngor pointed to a photograph of a little Cambodian girl. The 
child, one of tens of thousands of orphans who live in refugee camps dotting 
the Thai-Cambodian border, squats on the ground, resting her chin on her palms 
as she stares ahead with a blank expression. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see in her eyes?" Ngor asked. "Where is the future? Her eyes are very 
far away from the world." The girl and other Cambodian refugee children 
represent a generation on the verge of being lost forever, he said. For 
Cambodia to survive as a country, he added, the children must have a future. 
</P>
<P>
Since making "The Killing Fields," Ngor, who continues to live in a modest 
two-bedroom apartment in an aging building near Chinatown, has devoted most of 
his time aiding refugees and pushing for peace in Cambodia. To help the 
estimated 380,000 Cambodian refugees -- 60% of whom are orphans -- stuck in 
camps near the Thai-Cambodian border, Ngor helped found the Brussels-based 
Aides aux Personnes Deplacees and the Paris-based Enfants d'Angkor. 
</P>
<P>
Ngor's personal mission is especially significant now, as Cambodia teeters on 
the brink of civil war in the wake of a failed peace conference in Paris last 
month and with the prospect that Vietnamese troops, who occupied the country 
after forcing out the Khmer Rouge 10 years ago, will pull out of Cambodia on 
Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Ngor, watching his country's hopes for a peaceful future again crumbling, does 
not endorse any faction. But there will be no peace in Cambodia, he said, 
unless the Vietnamese leave the country and the Khmer Rouge are forbidden to 
return to power. 
</P>
<P>
His criticisms of the Khmer Rouge and of the political infighting among 
Cambodian leaders have alienated Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whom he portrayed 
unfavorably in his autobiography, "Haing Ngor, a Cambodian Odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
"My book came out and he acted like I am his No. 1 enemy," Ngor said of the 
prince, who forbade him on his recent trip from visiting the "Site B" refugee 
camp he controls near the Thai-Cambodian border. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching into his wallet, Ngor pulled out an $8,000 check from Enfants d'Angkor 
that he could not deliver to help children at the camp. "He is a very mercurial 
prince," Ngor said of Sihanouk. "He flip-flops. He never respect his own 
words." But Ngor said the world still needs Sihanouk, because he is the one who 
can bring the warring factions back to the conference table. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Ngor plans to continue his efforts to educate Americans 
about Cambodian refugees' plight. He has agreed to appear later this month on 
ABC's "PrimeTime Live," which has scheduled a segment on Cambodia's political 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Ngor said his concern goes beyond Cambodian refugees. He is researching a book 
about the plight of 14 million refugees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But his heart will always be with Cambodia, and for now, with his countrymen 
who despair in refugee camps. Their existence focuses now only on the trucks 
that bring them food. "My rice field is the truck," the refugees told him. "If 
the truck comes, I have food. . . . Every day they just wait. Wait the trucks 
coming and hand out food." 
</P>
<P>
When he asked refugee children where their country is, they stretched out their 
arms to point at the cluttered camp around them and told him: "Here is my 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Ngor told them their country is Cambodia, not the camp. But they answered, "No, 
I born here. I live here. This is my country."

This week, two milestones in the annals of fame (or is it infamy?) are being 
recorded. The first is that Zsa Zsa Gabor has gone on trial for slapping a 
Beverly Hills policeman, disobeying an officer of the law, driving with an 
expired license, having an open container of alcohol in her Rolls-Royce and 
operating a vehicle without registration. 
</P>
<P>
The second is that the "New Hollywood Squares" TV game show has gone off the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the surface, these two events don't seem to have much in common. But 
think about it for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Where was Gabor always welcome no matter who else thought she was a washed-up 
actress? Where could she always count on being photographed at least from the 
waist up? Where was she always allowed to say the most outrageous things 
without risking even a raised eyebrow? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incarnated and Reincarnated 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Squares," of course. Because in its first inception from 1976 to 
1981, and then in its reincarnation from September, 1986, until its final rerun 
aired last week, the show was a home for people like her. Or, more 
specifically, for People Who Are Famous for Being Famous. 
</P>
<P>
Make fun of PFBFers all you want. Everyone does. But no matter if they were 
spotted hanging out at the old Studio 54 disco in New York, hamming it up on 
the "Love Boat" or hosting late-night cable TV commercials -- all favorite 
haunts -- they've always managed for better or for worse to carve out a hunk of 
space in the public's consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
And how have such PFBF Hall of Famers as Gabor, Charo, Bianca Jagger and George 
Hamilton achieved this reknown despite very little talent, not much physical 
effort and no visible means of financial support? 
</P>
<P>
Through those three S's of Continuous Celebrity -- Sex, Scandal and Staying 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sort of like pimples," explains Hollywood publicist Michael Levine, 
who represents such PFBFers as Vanna White and Dr. Joyce Brothers as well as 
Non-PFBFers. "They rise to the surface and burst open. Then, some leave a 
scar." 
</P>
<P>
Already, in the days leading up to the courtroom drama of the People of the 
State of California v. Zsa Zsa Gabor, journalists have reported every twist and 
turn no matter how absurd -- from the tidbit that Gabor would wear a basic 
black Donna Karan dress (though she had told some media that the frock was from 
Valentino) to the nubbin that the Society for the Prevention of Anything 
Against Zsa Zsa is selling "Free Zsa Zsa, Dahling" T-shirts for $19.95. And the 
trial itself seems certain to attract almost as much media coverage as, say, 
Oliver North's, Leona Helmsley's or Jim Bakker's, all of whom were at one time 
major figures in the fields of politics, business and religion. 
</P>
<P>
And, yet, amazingly, right up there with them is a Hungarian has-been whose 
only serious acting credit was the 1952 fictional biopic of artist 
Toulouse-Lautrec, "Moulin Rouge." Whose most interesting accomplishment is her 
marriages to eight men. And whose primary contribution to society consists of 
two books ("Zsa Zsa's Complete Guide to Men," and "How to Get a Man, How to 
Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man"), face creams and fake jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bevy of Blatherers 
</P>
<P>
Still, that was enough to earn her at least a half-dozen appearances on the 
"New Hollywood Squares" as well as umpteen number on the original version, 
which also managed to make network TV and syndication stars of a bevy of 
blatherers including Paul Lynde, Rose-Marie, Wally Cox, Charlie Weaver and 
George Gobel. Not to be outdone, the "New Hollywood Squares" provided a 
showcase for such wanna-be PFBFers as actor Jm J. Bullock and announcer Shadoe 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to make those snide remarks about these people. I probably thought 
that way, too, when I first started," says "New Hollywood Squares" executive 
producer Rick Rosner. 
</P>
<P>
"But book a Charles Nelson Reilly, and you've got a lot of fun. Put Zsa Zsa 
next to ALF, and it's explosive. I used to think if it weren't for these shows, 
where would these people go? But now I know that if it weren't for these 
people, where would these shows be?" 
</P>
<P>
To Rosner, the appeal of PFBFers lies in their personalities. Call it charm, 
call it charisma or just call it a charade. "But many of these guests are 
wonderful guests, and they're just good at being wonderful guests," Rosner 
says. "You could almost say they act like catalysts. They know how to make the 
show interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Leo Braudy, USC's Bing Professor of English and author of "The Frenzy of 
Reknown: Fame and Its History," also believes PFBFers provide a valuable 
community service: to remind us that anyone can become famous. "I think they're 
cozy," he contends. "They present the possibility that you can rise from a log 
cabin and become an aristocrat who does nothing." 
</P>
<P>
PFBFers also share certain characteristics, none of which have anything to do 
with winning Academy Awards, climbing Mt. Everest or performing Mother 
Teresa-like acts of charity (though Gabor was the goodwill ambassador for the 
Montgomery Ward Auto Club in 1980).

Instead, they live for those rare invitations to sit next to Johnny or Arsenio. 
They go into withdrawal if their photographs aren't in the tabloids weekly. 
They can't help acting as if the world owes them a living. They get younger 
with each passing year, thanks to face-lifts and altered driving licenses. They 
cling to their ex-spouses' fame like a life preserver. They rely upon their 
good looks like a life annuity. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the most crucial requirement for active membership, they get into legal 
scrapes, romantic liaisons and business deals as regularly as Gabor hires 
divorce lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Though few can match Gabor's penchant for playing Peck's Bad Girl -- whether it 
was that ruckus over her dogs on Delta Airlines, or her refusal to act in front 
of a dinner theater audience when some handicapped persons sat in the front row 
-- many have tried. 
</P>
<P>
For years, sometime actress Grace Jones merely lived up to her reputation as an 
obnoxious guest on "Late Night with David Letterman," until she recently found 
herself in real trouble, in a Jamaican jail accused of possessing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
And Margaret Trudeau didn't limit her bizarre behavior to embarrassing her 
prime minister husband or trailing after the Rolling Stones; she, too, was 
arrested on a drug charge (later dropped). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Name Lingers 
</P>
<P>
In the romantic sector, Apollonia's relationship with Prince may have faded, 
but somehow her name still lingers. Philippe Junot, the French playboy who was 
Princess Caroline's first husband, is still worthy of a tabloid headline. And 
Donna Rice, Fawn Hall and Jessica Hawn continue to be household words after 
their real or imagined celebrity relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Like moths to a flame, advertisers seek out PFBFers with quite lucrative 
consequences. Take, for instance, socialite Cornelia Guest, who calls herself 
an actress even though she hasn't yet secured a part. Nevertheless, her name 
was enough to snare a six-figure deal to hawk a hair product. And actress Jill 
St. John, whose most significant role was dating Henry Kissinger, has a new 
career as a cookbook author and cooking columnist. 
</P>
<P>
The PFBF Hall of Famer, however, manages to hit a home-run on all fronts. 
George Hamilton, for instance, knew his TV and movie career had stalled. Yet he 
found a new lease on life -- or at least, the cover of supermarket tabloids -- 
when he started squiring around Elizabeth Taylor. And today, he is marketing 
not one but two different skin care lines -- an anti-aging cleansing regimen 
advertised on late-night cable TV, and a tanning formula sold in discount 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sudden Transformation 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has Bianca Jagger succeeded in every category, from her sudden 
transformation from the model of obscurity into the wife of Mick Jagger, to her 
132 mentions in "The Andy Warhol Diaries," most of them so scandalous in nature 
that she is pursuing a lawsuit against the book, to her recent recovery from an 
accident after which, according to a People magazine article, she exercised her 
way back to health. Naturally, an exercise video is afoot. 
</P>
<P>
Even Charo, that wriggling wonder who was a regular on "Hollywood Squares" both 
old and new, parlayed her love affair with geriatric bandleader Xavier Cugat 
into a recurring role on "Love Boat" episodes and most recently ownership of a 
swank Hawaiian restaurant. All she needs now to complete her PFBF profile is a 
late-night cable commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, PFBFers are not to be confused with those other PFBFers -- People 
Who Are Famous for Being Failures. These people also show up on late-night 
cable commercials, like "MASH" star McLean Stevenson, whose bald spot grabs the 
spotlight these days in an ad for a hair-loss remedy, or former Hugh Hefner 
playmate Barbi Benton, who now sells piano-playing videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
If in doubt, true PFBFers -- that is, People Who Are Famous for Being Famous -- 
can always be measured by their ability to turn out a crowd. Indeed, they know 
how to create a media event with the same native instinct that salmon use to 
swim upstream, like the time that Bianca rented a Malibu beach house, rounded 
up reporters and announced the start of her film career, which didn't last 
nearly as long as her press conference. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Richard "Mr." Blackwell's annual Worst-Dressed List, which has 
been a lot more famous than his dress designs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the time that Zsa Zsa almost created a riot while posing for 
photographers at London's Heathrow Airport in 1973 wearing nothing but 
stockings under her fur coat. "It was hot on the plane, dahling," she cooed. "I 
just had to peel off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garnered Certain Tributes 
</P>
<P>
And by keeping herself in the media eye, Gabor has received certain tributes 
that many would envy, from lecturing at colleges (Saddleback College's 
Celebrity Series) to receiving political honors (guest speaker at a 
$1,000-a-plate dinner for the Michigan GOP party). 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the real secret of the success of People Who Are Famous for Being 
Famous is the fact that we talk about them at all. "If the audience didn't 
respond to these people, they wouldn't exist," says academic Braudy. "It's all 
for our benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Levine agrees. "Why are they famous? The fault lies in ourselves, not 
in our stars." 
</P>
<P>
And while few things about the future can be called certain, two things surely 
are. The first is that Zsa Zsa Gabor will make headlines again. 
</P>
<P>
And the second, says producer Rosner, is that "in four or five years' time, 
'Hollywood Squares' will be resurrected. And, once again, we'll all wonder 
why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR BEING FAMOUS IF . . . 
</P>
<P>
1 -- You hesitate when filling out the space on forms for "occupation." 
</P>
<P>
2 -- You can only get booked on cable "public access" talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- A Beverly Hills realtor selling a house notes that you once lived there. 
No one buys it. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- You subscribe to the National Enquirer hoping to see your name. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- You preside over ribbon cuttings for mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- You've just come out with a cookbook/cosmetics/costume jewelry/diet 
video/wig line. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- You show up at parties with Cesar Romero. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- You are top seed at a celebrity tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Your accountant starts listing your free dinners as reportable income. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Paparazzi don't take your picture as you leave the Betty Ford Center. 
They already have it from the last time.

Enrique Zambrano, charged in the slaying of Berkeley Waterfront Commissioner 
Luis Reyna and the savage beatings of a Berkeley couple last year, has been 
arrested in Palm Springs, the FBI reported today. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Chuck Latting said in San Francisco that Zambrano and his 
girlfriend, Celebration Oberman, were taken into custody by FBI agents and 
local police Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano is accused in the July 18, 1988, slaying of Reyna, whose decapitated, 
handless corpse was found by a hiker in the hills of nearby Lafayette on July 
26, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The two had been friends, but had a falling-out after Reyna served as the key 
witness against Zambrano in connection with the near-fatal attacks on Berkeley 
Prof. Robert Mishell and his wife, Barbara. Reyna told police Zambrano 
confessed the Jan. 31, 1988, attacks to him.

U.S. EXPANDS PRESSURES ON GEN. NORIEGA

The United States said today it has expanded economic sanctions against Panama 
in an effort to force strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of office. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the measures included 
withdrawing Panama's 1989 sugar quota and widening the list of Panamanian 
companies and individuals associated with Noriega to whom Americans will be 
barred from making payments. 
</P>
<P>
The United States first imposed sanctions against Panama last year but so far 
they have failed to budge Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on charges of 
illegal drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these actions are a direct result of Gen. Noriega's continued 
unwillingness to respect the will of the Panamanian people by stepping down and 
permitting the installation of a freely elected government," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said Panama's 1989 sugar quota of 30,537 metric tons has been 
reallocated to other countries, which she did not name. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the sugar quota denies the Panamanian government close to $15 
million in revenue, she said.

Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk, in a major concession to anti-apartheid 
leaders, today approved plans for a massive church-led demonstration in Cape 
Town on Wednesday and declared, "The door to a new South Africa is open." 
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary statement contrasting sharply with his predecessor's 
hard-line responses to public protest since the government imposed a state of 
emergency three years ago, De Klerk said arrangements are being made to ensure 
that the protest will be orderly. 
</P>
<P>
The protest will coincide with a special parliamentary session at which De 
Klerk is to be nominated as president.

A harmful but rare computer virus is set to attack IBM-compatible personal 
computers after Oct. 12, experts in computer security said today. 
</P>
<P>
The virus cripples personal computers' hard disks, where programs and data are 
stored, by wiping out the directory sections known as the partition table and 
file allocation table. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taking away the index from the library," said John McAfee, chairman 
of the Computer Virus Industry Assn. in Santa Clara, Calif. The industry 
association says it has created a program that will detect the virus and 
another one that will eradicate it. Both are available free from computer 
bulletin boards or from the association itself. 
</P>
<P>
But McAfee said the virus, while unusually harmful, is so rare that most PC 
owners do not need to be overly concerned.

EAST BERLIN RAPS HUNGARY; SOVIETS HIT 'UNUSUAL STEP'

<P>
Tempers rose in East Berlin today, and Moscow accused fellow Warsaw Pact ally 
Hungary of taking "an unusual step" in letting more than 10,000 East Germans 
cross the border to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev also flew to East Berlin in what 
Western diplomats saw as a Kremlin gesture of moral support, but Moscow denied 
that the trip was tied to the biggest refugee flow since the Berlin Wall was 
built in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin demanded that Hungary stop East Germans from streaming to the West 
and said it expects Hungary to revoke its decision to suspend parts of a 
visa-free travel agreement between them. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary's behavior is a clear violation of legal treaties and thus constitutes 
a violation of the basic interests of East Germany. The Hungarian side is 
responsible for the resulting situation," said an official protest handed to 
the Hungarian Foreign Ministry and published by the ADN news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's foreign minister, Gyula Horn, rejected as "unacceptable and 
insulting" a persistent East Berlin suggestion that Hungary had been paid by 
Bonn to allow the refugees out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dollars Are Flowing' 
</P>
<P>
But East German official media kept up an onslaught against Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollars are flowing into the pockets of reformers who are capitalists' 
friends," wrote Hans-Dieter Schuett, editor of the Communist youth daily Junge 
Welt. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which leads the Warsaw Pact but is pledged to economic and 
political openness, also stepped into the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary has taken an unusual step," Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov told a Moscow news conference, without directly criticizing the 
Hungarian government. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally this situation is of some concern to us," he said. "But it does not 
affect us directly." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's surge across the open border between Hungary and Austria slowed today, 
dashing speculation that another wave of East German tourists in 
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria might vote with their feet and head West 
through Hungary rather than going home after their vacations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Hungary denied a Budapest radio report that 16,000 East Germans had crossed 
from Czechoslovakia on Monday and said the real figure was fewer than 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Austrian officials said more than 10,600 East Germans had crossed from 
Hungary into Austria on their way to West Germany since Budapest opened the 
frontier at midnight Sunday. About 4,000 tourists joined 6,500 who had waited 
in Hungarian camps. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 40 refugees arrived this afternoon, Red Cross officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment there is no indication that there will be another great wave," 
said Heinrich Unger, Red Cross director for the Austrian border region of 
Burgenland. 
</P>
<P>
Echoes of the exodus reverberated in Czechoslovakia, where more than 250 East 
Germans who had occupied the West German Embassy in Prague gave up their bid to 
gain passage to the West. 
</P>
<P>
They left the building to head for home after getting pledges of official aid 
to get to the West legally, Western diplomats said. Another 145 would-be 
emigres stayed in the mission.

MAZOWIECKI NEARLY COLLAPSES, RECOVERS WHILE INTRODUCING NEW POLISH CABINET

Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki nearly collapsed from fatigue while 
introducing his new Cabinet to Parliament today, prompting a 45-minute recess 
until he returned and jokingly compared himself to Poland's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Mazowiecki, 62, said his legacy from the Solidarity 
movement, which brought about the first non-Communist government in the Warsaw 
Pact, could help heal the divisions in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I have come as a man of Solidarity and of its heritage of August (1980)," he 
said, a reference to the workers' revolt that led to the birth of the 
independent union. "This heritage means the ability to liquidate divisions 
(among people)." 
</P>
<P>
After speaking for 40 minutes and taking several sips of water, Mazowiecki, 
looking exhausted but composed, asked for a recess. 
</P>
<P>
He was examined by doctors, who conducted an electrocardiogram test but found 
no serious problems, said Dr. Zofia Kuratowska. She said he had felt faint 
because of overwork and nervous strain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Have Recovered' 
</P>
<P>
Deputies applauded as Mazowiecki, looking tired and somber, returned to the 
rostrum after the break. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me. I have reached the same state as the Polish economy," he said in a 
rare glint of humor. "I have recovered, and I hope the economy will also 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers swiftly approved the Cabinet after Mazowiecki urged them to change 
virtually every aspect of Polish life. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 402 in favor of Mazowiecki's Cabinet, none against and 13 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, smiling, lifted his hands in the "V" for victory sign that for so 
long represented illegal opposition to the Communist government. The Sejm, or 
Parliament, rose to applaud. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest dream has come true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the new Cabinet ministers were read, with the loudest ovation 
going to Jacek Kuron, the new labor minister who spent nine years in prison for 
his opposition activism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Walesa 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who turned down a chance to lead the new 
administration to remain a private citizen, promised full support to the new 
government headed "by one of us." 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in half a century, Poland has a government that can be 
considered by millions of people as their own," he said in Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said of the 
new government: "We are prepared to cooperate with that government and develop 
our relations with Poland."

The Duchess of York is expecting a second baby in March, Buckingham Palace 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is great news," said the red-haired wife of Prince Andrew, who is the 
second son of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The former Sarah Ferguson, popularly known as "Fergie," and Andrew were "very 
pleased" to make the announcement, a palace statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The new baby will be the monarch's sixth grandchild. If the baby is a boy, he 
will supersede his sister, 13-month-old Princess Beatrice, to become fifth in 
line to the throne. A girl would follow Beatrice as sixth in line. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, 29, a navy lieutenant, was attending a refresher helicopter course at 
Portland navy base in southern England when the announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess, who will be 30 in October, was attending a literary luncheon. She 
told reporters, "I am very pleased that the news did not leak out. . . . I 
didn't want it splashed all over the front page. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrew is away flying helicopters, and I decided to announce it because it is 
three months."

ETHICS PANEL APPROVES FRANK PROBE;

<P>
ATKINS EXCUSED FROM INVESTIGATION IN SEX-FOR-HIRE CASE

The House Ethics Committee today approved a preliminary investigation of Rep. 
Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who admitted hiring a male prostitute for sex and then 
employing the man as a personal aide. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who announced the 
investigation, would not say whether the vote was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also announced that the panel approved the request of one of its members, 
Rep. Chester G. Atkins (D-Mass.), to withdraw from consideration of the Frank 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said Monday that he feared a potential conflict because he and Frank 
could be opponents in the 1992 election because of congressional redistricting. 
Dixon said another member would be named to serve in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, a leading congressional liberal and acknowledged homosexual, sought the 
investigation of his conduct with the male prostitute, Stephen J. Gobie. 
</P>
<P>
The committee resolution said the panel is "aware of assertions relating to the 
conduct of Rep. Barney Frank in connection with his employment of a personal 
assistant." The panel "has determined that the matters merit further inquiry," 
the resolution added. 
</P>
<P>
Today's action begins only the first round of the House's disciplinary process 
and determines whether a more complete investigation is needed. During the 
preliminary phase, the panel can issue subpoenas and take testimony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Expulsion 
</P>
<P>
If the probe goes beyond the initial stage, the committee could hold a 
disciplinary proceeding and recommend punishment to the full House that could 
range from a reprimand to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that despite Frank's request for an investigation, the committee 
vote "was not based on his request but on our own motion."' 
</P>
<P>
Frank said he used personal funds to pay Gobie as a housekeeper and driver from 
July, 1985, through August, 1987. Gobie said he used Frank's Capitol Hill 
apartment to run a prostitution ring with the lawmaker's knowledge, but Frank 
repeatedly denied knowing about the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Gobie, whose involvement with Frank was first reported by the Washington Times 
last month, has publicly expressed willingness to testify before the Ethics 
Committee if his lawyer approves. 
</P>
<P>
Frank has admitted paying Gobie $80 for sex after answering a classified ad in 
a Washington gay newspaper in the spring of 1985. The lawmaker said he then 
hired Gobie, hoping to change his ways, but fired him after he learned of the 
prostitution ring.

Jaguar's chairman said today that the British car maker is cutting the base 
price of its basic XJ-6 sports car nearly 10% as part of a strategy to energize 
sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman John Egan, attending the Frankfurt Motor Show, said conditions have 
been tough in America, Jaguar's most important market. He said Jaguar will cut 
the price of the basic XJ-6 from $44,000 to $39,700 by eliminating extras. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the United States, which account for more than 40% of Jaguar's total, 
fell 5.2% in the first eight months of 1989 to 12,400.

U.S. EXTENDS SUGAR IMPORT QUOTA

Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter announced today a nine-month extension 
of the current sugar import quota year and an increase of about 860,000 tons in 
the amount of foreign sugar that can be imported. 
</P>
<P>
Import quotas are used to protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign sugar 
being dumped on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
The original 1989 quota year began Jan. 1 and was to have ended Dec. 31. The 
extension lets the quota year run through Sept. 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said the change in the quota was "an action independent" of a ruling 
earlier this year by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the U.S. 
sugar import quotas are in violation of international trading rules.

Cable News Network today said it is considering an evening newscast to compete 
directly with the big three TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. "to go 
head to head with the networks," and CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw would have a 
role on the program, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, CNN officials haven't made a final determination of whether a 
frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather would be a good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a half-hour, stand-alone newscast, unlike CNN's 
virtually 24-hour, all-news format, in which the news is continuously updated.

Cleveland Indians Manager Doc Edwards, his team 14 1/2 games out of first 
place, was fired today and replaced on an interim basis by special assignment 
scout John Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Hart was third base coach last season at Baltimore and was brought to Cleveland 
as a scout this year by Indians President Hank Peters, who was formerly general 
manager of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' dismissal was announced by Peters, who said, "This is not a 
particularly happy occasion for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
54-54 at Mid-Summer 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had kept the Indians in contention through mid-summer with Cleveland 
54-54 and 1 1/2 games out of first place on Aug. 4. Since then the team went 
11-24. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians lost back-to-back extra-inning games to division-leading Toronto on 
Saturday and Sunday. The team has lost 12 of 14 extra-inning games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend losses dropped the Indians to 14 1/2 games out of first place in 
the American League East division and 13 games under .500. Both marks were the 
worst of the season for Cleveland, which had Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians went into Tuesday night's start of a home series against Detroit 
with a 65-78 record, in sixth place in the division. 
</P>
<P>
Through Sunday's loss, the Indians had lost eight of their last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 52, was named Cleveland's 33rd manager July 16, 1987, replacing Pat 
Corrales. Last year, his first full season with the Indians, the team went 
78-84, a 17-win improvement over the 1987 season.

BECKER BUYS $10-MILLION LLOYDS POLICY AGAINST BEING KIDNAPED

<P>
West German tennis star Boris Becker has taken out a $10-million insurance 
policy against being kidnaped, Lloyds of London said today. 
</P>
<P>
A Lloyds spokesman who requested anonymity said that Becker, who Sunday added 
the U.S. Open title to his Wimbledon championship, is paying $160,000 a year 
for the policy, which is underwritten by Lloyds. 
</P>
<P>
"Policies like these are common for a lot of prominent people," the Lloyds 
spokesman said. "If he is not around to make his contractual agreements, a lot 
of money has to be paid out by agents and others who've made arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Another tabloid paper, the Sun, reported that Becker regularly receives threats 
in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Today reported that Ion Tiriac, Becker's manager, took out a $4-million policy 
on Becker four years ago and that payments were $12,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said the worldwide attention Becker receives with victories like 
Sunday's triumph over Ivan Lendl for the U.S. Open title made it necessary to 
increase the kidnap coverage.

Top-seeded Alberto Mancini of Argentina and No. 2 seed Sergio Bruguera of Spain 
were ousted in the first round of the $220,000 Geneva Open tennis tournament 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, who won the Italian Open earlier this year, lost to Belgian qualifier 
Xavier Daufresne 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). Bruguera lost to unseeded Christian 
Bergstroem of Sweden, 6-3, 0-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Daufresne, a 20-year-old ranked 470th in the world, took advantage of Mancini's 
erratic ground strokes and leg cramps at the end of the third set to topple the 
world's 11th-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Lucky' 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to be ridiculous at the beginning of the match," said Daufresne, a 
Belgian army recruit on special leave for the tournament. "And I was lucky that 
he had cramps at 5-6 in the last set." 
</P>
<P>
The Waterloo native, playing only his second Grand Prix tournament, is 
Belgium's third-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
"The more matches I play here, the less time I have to spend in the barracks. 
If I lose in the next round, I have to return right away," Daufresne said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," said Mancini, the sensation of the 1989 spring 
season with victories in the Italian Open and at Monte Carlo, where he beat 
Boris Becker in the final. "I never had cramps as a pro before. 
</P>
<P>
"To change from the cement of the U.S. Open last week to clay here was 
difficult. He started nervous, but when he saw I was impatient, he played 
better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised at Win 
</P>
<P>
Bergstroem said he was surprised that he won, noting that Bruguera is ranked 
26th in the world while he is only 85th. 
</P>
<P>
"I was operated on for my tonsils this January and have not done well lately," 
said the Goeteborg native who was the 1984 Swedish junior champion.

NCAA CHIEF ASKS DELAY OF BRADLEY BILL

The head of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., pleading for more time for 
the organization to act on its own, pledged today to lobby for a Senate bill to 
require colleges to disclose the graduation rates of their athletes unless the 
NCAA takes action on the matter at its January meeting. 
</P>
<P>
However, that assertion by NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz at a Senate 
committee hearing did not deter Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a former NBA star, 
who said he will continue to push the legislation and hopes to have it passed 
before January. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA collects graduation data from its member institutions and issues it in 
an annual report. However, the report is not broken down by individual 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley bill would require that the individual figures be reported publicly 
to the U.S. Department of Education and that each institution also disclose its 
own rates to prospective athletic recruits.

Sean Elliott's agent indicated that he may seek more than $2 million a year for 
the San Antonio Spurs' first-round draft pick, but Elliott's contract 
negotiations are on hold at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see what the market tells us," said Bob Woolf of Boston, who 
represents Elliott and Glen Rice, who was drafted No. 4 by the Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
In published reports today, Woolf said he is waiting to see the "market value" 
of the NBA's top draft picks. Elliott was drafted No. 3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly, Woolf said, he doesn't expect negotiations with the Spurs to 
start until Sacramento signs Pervis Ellison, the No. 1 pick in June's college 
draft. There have been reports that Ellison has been offered a five-year 
contract worth $14 million, nearly $3 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider Sean and Pervis just about interchangeable," Woolf said, referring 
to the possible money being offered Ellison.
