Jose Alfredo San Roman, a commander of the Cuban exile invasion force that was 
defeated at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, has been found dead with a note near his 
side, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact cause of death has not been determined, it appears to be a 
suicide, police spokesman George Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
San Roman, 58, was found dead in his home Sunday morning. An autopsy is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he had been depressed lately," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, San Roman -- a captain in the army of Fulgencio Batista, the former 
Cuban dictator overthrown by Fidel Castro -- was one of the commanders of the 
1,500 U.S.-trained and -equipped Cuban exiles on what turned out to be a 
disastrous attempt to invade Cuba and oust Castro. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt by Brigade 2506 to land at the Bay of Pigs was trounced by Castro's 
forces and U.S. participation in the affair proved a humiliating defeat for the 
Administration of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Veterans of the Brigade 2506, formed in Miami by survivors of 
the ill-fated invasion, said San Roman had long been depressed by the failure 
and Castro's continued grip on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been depressed for a long time over the problem in Cuba," said Jose 
Perdomo, who fought under San Roman at the Bay of Pigs.

EPA'S REACTION AWAITED; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL URGES DELAY IN SEWAGE PLANT UPGRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Sewage Task Force on Tuesday set the stage for a showdown with 
the federal government by unanimously recommending that the city of San Diego 
not upgrade the Point Loma sewage treatment plant until 2015. 
</P>
<P>
The task force determined that the city could keep ocean waters off Point Loma 
safe and clean for the next 25 years without adding expensive secondary 
treatment technology mandated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The task force instead recommended that the City Council begin work on a 
multibillion-dollar string of waste-water treatment and reclamation plants -- 
but delay adding the new technology at the Point Loma plant for at least 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Task force chairman E. Harvey Miles said the recommendation was not intended to 
sidestep regulations that mandate the added treatment. "The question would be 
when we go to secondary treatment," Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain Tuesday how the EPA would react to a city plan that delayed 
the Point Loma treatment plant upgrading for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has seen the task force's plan and has "asked for refinements," 
according to Ted Bromfield, chief deputy city attorney. Bromfield declined to 
comment on whether the EPA, which has demanded that the city move quickly to 
bring the Point Loma plant into compliance with the federal Clean Water Act, 
would go along with the 25-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failed to Meet Deadline 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who unsuccessfully lobbied federal officials for a waiver, 
failed to meet a 1987 EPA deadline for installing secondary treatment equipment 
at the Point Loma plant. The federal government subsequently sued the city, and 
Bromfield is now involved in "very sensitive" negotiations that could bring a 
settlement before the case heads to court Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
When the Point Loma plant should be upgraded constitutes "a key part of those 
negotiations," Bromfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force's recommendation was significant because it marked the first 
time an official government body has stated that a plant upgrading, which might 
cost as much as $1 billion, would not significantly improve the quality of 
ocean waters off Point Loma. The resolution passed Tuesday noted that the EPA 
and a group of distinguished local scientists have failed to provide 
"conclusive proof" that advanced treatment is or isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bob Filner, who along with Councilman Bruce Henderson has 
argued that advanced treatment isn't necessary, on Tuesday applauded the task 
force recommendation. "I was hoping they'd make that recommendation to us," 
Filner said. "It would effectively give us a de facto waiver until we work out 
some other legislative solution." 
</P>
<P>
However, Filner acknowledged that the City Council can't end its long-running 
legal battle with the EPA simply by embracing the task force recommendation. 
"It won't settle (the federal) lawsuit unless EPA accepts it," Filner said. 
"And I don't know if the EPA would accept it." 
</P>
<P>
The two council members, with support from scientists at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, have argued that advanced treatment won't produce 
corresponding benefits for the ocean waters. They hope to gain congressional 
support for legislation that would exempt the city from the federal sewage 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparing Motions 
</P>
<P>
Filner said several city councils in the county are preparing motions that 
support the long-running effort for federal legislation that would exempt some 
cities from installing the expensive secondary-treatment technology. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bromfield on Tuesday cautioned task force members against passing a 
resolution endorsing congressional action to loosen secondary-treatment 
regulations. Such a resolution "has the appearance . . . of backsliding," 
Bromfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force's recommendation suggested that the 25-year delay would help to 
maximize "the present investment and useful life of Point Loma," lessen the 
burden upon taxpayers and still protect the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Miles directed staff members to forward the recommendation to the City Council 
this morning.

RUNNING DEL MAR FOR THE BETTOR; 
</P>
<P>
OPERATIONS CHIEF ALSO FOUND EXCITEMENT AS NFL REFEREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pictures on Harry (Bud) Brubaker's wall tell the story of his life -- 
autographed mementoes from Babe Ruth, Bing Crosby, Hank Aaron, Willie Shoemaker 
and baseball manager Sparky Anderson, whom Brubaker coached at Dorsey High 
School in his native Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Bud, as his friends call him, was on a first-name basis with 
Marilyn Monroe -- "a shy, gorgeous woman," he calls her -- and former FBI 
director J. Edgar Hoover -- whom he remembers as "a mysterious man, an aloof 
man." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Monroe and Hoover had in common, Brubaker said, was that they both 
loved horses. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker, 79, is director of operations for the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. He 
oversees racing at the Del Mar Race Track, where he has worked since 1945 and 
which ends its 50th season today. Brubaker also is still a consultant to the 
National Football League. He worked as a referee from 1950 through 1970, 
officiating some of the biggest games in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a longtime resident of North San Diego County, which he considers 
"just a notch below heaven." He's lived here every summer since 1945 and 
continuously since 1976. His current postmark is Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
As Brubaker reviewed eight decades of change, he had a kind, cherubic face and 
a quick, easy laugh 
</P>
<P>
About the increasing congestion in San Diego County: "I swear we're getting to 
be like L.A. The traffic is just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he's marveling over the speed, size and strength of 
today's pro athlete. He says pro football will end in the next century because 
it will be humanly impossible to take the punishment required to play it. 
</P>
<P>
"The size and speed will finish off the game," he said. "The human body wasn't 
meant to take all that. Nobody in the defensive line weighs less than 275 
pounds any more, and they all run 40 yards in less than five seconds. All quick 
as cats, too." 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker still scouts potential referees for the NFL. He has his eye on a 
"terrific ref" in the Pacific 10 conference but knows he can't recommend him 
because he's only 4-foot-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against short people," he said, "but, these days in the NFL, 
you've got to have a presence on the field. If you don't, they'll walk over 
you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intimidation, NFL style 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker recalled that more than one player has tried to do that to him. 
</P>
<P>
"In one game in Dallas in the late '60s, the Cowboys were driving," he said. 
"They had the ball near the other team's goal line. They were playing in the 
Cotton Bowl then -- what a crazy, noisy old place that was. Well, somebody 
fumbled the ball into the end zone, and it rolled out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule in those days was for the other team to get the ball back. It was 
ruled a touchback and came to the 20-yard line. Don Meredith (then the Cowboys' 
quarterback, later a commentator on ABC's 'Monday Night Football') just came 
unglued. He was yelling, 'How could that be? That's ridiculous!' And the crowd 
just went bananas. He and I went 'round and 'round for quite a while -- one of 
those games that lingers in the memory." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1968 NFL championship game between Baltimore and Cleveland, won with 
stunning ease by Baltimore, Brubaker and the officiating crew he headed were 
speculating as to how severely the Colts would hammer their next opponent, the 
New York Jets, the American Football League champions in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
"We all said Baltimore would kill 'em," he said, which, of course, didn't 
happen. After brashly saying that he "guaranteed" a victory, Jets quarterback 
Joe Namath pulled it off, a gesture and a game Brubaker remembers as a turning 
point in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker never refereed a Super Bowl game, but he did oversee several NFL title 
games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's the Excitement 
</P>
<P>
He loved officiating and watching football for the same reason he loves going 
to the track each day and doing his job -- supervising the parking lot 
attendants, the ticket takers, the program sellers, ushers and gatemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I admit it," he said. "I love excitement." 
</P>
<P>
He's seen people win as much as $200,000 in one day, and he's seen the sadness 
of someone losing that much. 
</P>
<P>
He said a frequent bettor at the track was Pete Rose, whom Brubaker got to know 
through Sparky Anderson, who managed Rose when both were with the Cincinnati 
Reds in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the Reds were in town to play the Padres in a night game, Pete was 
at the track during the day," Brubaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever a man who adheres to rules, Brubaker sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete knew the rules," he said. "If he bet on baseball, he must have known it 
would come back to haunt him. Why did he do it?" 
</P>
<P>
When Brubaker started refereeing NFL games, he got $100 a game. When he 
finished almost 20 years ago, he was paid $450 a game. He said that now, if a 
ref is a 10-year veteran, he makes $2,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to enjoy it," he said, "and you have to have the highest integrity. 
I've had people ask me, 'When players say those things about you, doesn't it 
bother you?' And quite honestly, it didn't bother me. But I've seen a lot of 
guys quit because they couldn't stand the criticism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instant Replay Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
Officiating now is different than when Brubaker did it. He thinks the 
relatively new innovation of instant replay is a good idea "because everyone 
makes mistakes. Even though I do think it hurts a ref's confidence knowing that 
thing is up there." 
</P>
<P>
When Brubaker stalked NFL hash marks, officials who threw flags couldn't say 
"sorry" and retract their intention -- as they're permitted to now. 
</P>
<P>
Did Brubaker ever make a call that cost a team a game? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably several times," he said with a laugh. "There were more than a few I 
wish I'd had back. But most of the mistakes a ref makes are never picked up by 
the crowd or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
One of the best decisions he ever made was coming to work at the track. He's 
proud of what he said is one of the largest "handles" in the nation: With 
off-track betting, Del Mar averages $7.2 million a day in proceeds. He said 
that racing at Del Mar, minus off-track revenues, averages $3 million a day 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker is often asked whether he likes horses and whether he ever wins any 
money on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, once in a while I bet," he said. "Sometimes, I'm lucky; sometimes, I'm 
not. Knowledge is a great thing, but I'm hardly a confirmed horse bettor. I've 
been around too long and too much to spend all the money I make betting 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
On the rare occasions that he's around horses, Brubaker is apt to appear 
tentative, something he never was on a football field staring at the likes of 
Big Daddy Lipscomb. 
</P>
<P>
"Mine is a front-side, not a back-side operation," he said. "Horses are on the 
back side. I handle the people who come to the races. I don't dislike horses, 
but I've never ridden very much. People, much more than horses, are my cup of 
tea." 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, Brubaker helps to oversee off-track betting at the 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
With such growth, a lot is gained, but a little bit is lost, Brubaker said, 
just as it is with NFL linemen who in no way resemble ordinary men. Del Mar is 
now "more serious," he acknowledged. People have to work harder, whether 
they're managing the track, riding a horse or scrambling to make a buck by 
picking a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the way, everyone seems to have gone a little bit crazy over 
fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
Brubaker recalls fondly the days when he would greet Betty Grable or Harry 
James in the Turf Club. He played softball with James and often shared a joke 
with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who he said were as side-splittingly funny 
in person as they were in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joe Frisco, Funnyman 
</P>
<P>
Out of all of the people he knew -- Crosby, Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, Jimmy 
Durante or Pat O'Brien -- Brubaker said the funniest was a comic named Joe 
Frisco. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of those guys you find yourself thinking about 40 years later," 
Brubaker said. "Maybe it was the way he said things, off the cuff all the time. 
He'd stick his hands in his pockets, pull out a dollar and say, 'I must be 
wearing somebody else's pants.' Or he'd check into a cheap hotel by the beach, 
gaze out at the Pacific Ocean and say, 'Well, at least for a little place, they 
do have a nice pool.' He kept everybody in stitches all the time. He just never 
became a big star like Crosby." 
</P>
<P>
What he remembers about those days is that there seemed to be more cookouts on 
the beach, more laughs, less intensity. But he wouldn't trade any of it, then 
or now, for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly," he said, "it's all been a lot of fun."

CARLSBAD PUTS BRAKES ON BIG OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Carlsbad put out the unwelcome mat Tuesday for the oil industry in 
the form of an ordinance that will make it nearly impossible for businesses 
related to offshore oil drilling to locate there. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlsbad prohibition on on-shore oil- and natural gas-support facilities 
differs from similar measures enacted by San Diego County and the cities of San 
Diego and Oceanside in that it is not an outright ban. On the advice of the 
city attorney, the Carlsbad ordinance seeks to protect itself from legal action 
by oil companies by leaving oil-related businesses a slim possibility of 
establishing themselves in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The action was sparked by the federal government's moves last year to open up 
Lease Sale 95 off the North County coast for oil drilling. In July, Congress 
approved a one-year moratorium on drilling off of much of the U.S. coastline, 
including a moratorium in California on any "pre-leasing" activities leading up 
to the sale of oil drilling leases until Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure on President 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad city officials, along with representatives of many other coastal 
cities, have traveled to Washington to urge the President to make the ban 
permanent. But, if and when the moratorium is called off, Carlsbad intends to 
be ready to make the city inhospitable to oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restricted businesses are oil- and gas-processing plants, refineries, 
storage facilities, transfer stations, pipelines, warehouses, offices, tanker 
terminals and helicopter pads. No such facilities now exist in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize there is not much we can do about offshore drilling besides lobby 
Washington," Councilman Eric Larson said before Tuesday's council meeting. "So 
we've decided the part we can play in this is by banning those on-shore 
facilities that would make drilling possible." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make it as strong as we possibly could, but we also wanted to 
make it lawful," Councilwoman Ann Kulchin added. "It does no good to have an 
ordinance full of flowery prose if it can't stand up in court. The way it's 
written, it's tough, it's tight, and we won't get sued." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, unanimously approved by the council at Tuesday's meeting, amends 
six local coastal plans and Carlsbad's General Plan and zoning codes. Under the 
law, oil- and gas-support facilities will be permitted only if the council 
makes six findings in favor of the proposed business: 
</P>
<P>
* That it will pose no danger to the life and property of the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
* That it will not pose a potential threat of damage or injuries to the 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
* That the benefits of the proposed project clearly outweigh the possible 
adverse environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
* That there are no feasible alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
* That the location of the facilities at the particular location clearly 
outweigh any potential harm to public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort 
and general welfare of people residing or working in the community, and will 
not be detrimental to property or the general welfare of the city. 
</P>
<P>
* The facility must be located only in zones specifically designated for 
industrial use. 
</P>
<P>
With those conditions in place, the current strong anti-oil drilling sentiment 
among the council members and the fact that very little of the city is zoned 
for industrial use make it all but impossible for any oil-supporting facility 
to successfully locate in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside and San Diego city and county, which enacted total bans on on-shore 
oil facilities, were sued by the Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. in 1987. The 
lawsuit, brought against 13 cities and counties in California, claimed that the 
municipalities' laws banning on-shore oil facilities violates the supremacy of 
the federal government embodied in the U. S. Constitution and threatens the 
nation's energy security. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was partially resolved in favor of the cities last year when a 
federal judge ruled that there was no basis to the oil industry claims that the 
local ordinances violate federal supremacy. U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. 
Marshall said the majority of the ordinances might cause oil companies 
additional expense and inconvenience, but are not "true obstacles to the 
accomplishment of the federal purpose." 
</P>
<P>
However, Marshall said it is possible that the ordinances in San Diego, 
Oceanside and San Diego County might violate the commerce clause of the U. S. 
Constitution. The case is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad City Atty. Vincent Biondo said he will be watching the court's 
decision, and, if the cities prevail, he will recommend that Carlsbad amend its 
law to impose a total ban of on-shore oil support facilities. Meanwhile, Biondo 
expects the oil companies not to bother to attack Carlsbad for its watered-down 
version. "We would hope they would continue to pursue the existing cases as the 
best and most expeditious way of determining what cities can and can't do," 
Biondo said. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "if the oil companies want to litigate, I suppose that's what 
we'll have to do. The protection of our citizens is our first concern." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kallman, executive director of the President's task force on oil 
drilling, said Tuesday that the city of Carlsbad is within its jurisdiction to 
enact the ordinance. "I recognize the concerns of local government, and it's 
certainly their prerogative to do that," he said in an interview from his 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
Nine public forums conducted in recent months by task force members throughout 
the state "have already exposed us to the overwhelming negative feeling of the 
public on this issue," Kallman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the actions of local governments that ban on-shore oil facilities will have 
no effect on the task force's recommendations to President Bush, due Jan. 1, on 
the feasibility of drilling off the California coast, he said. "We're not 
looking at the industry viewpoint, we're looking at the environmental 
consequences," Kallman said.

Was it a hint to the county Board of Supervisors? Tuesday's meeting, which 
began at 9:30 a.m., dragged on for so long that at 5 p.m. the county security 
guards removed the outside metal detector and left. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't true, as some have alleged, that Los Angeles has no sense of civic 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
After all, L.A.'s the place that offers the Chicago Pizza Works, Detroit Diesel 
Corp., Boston Deli, Philadelphia Red Fox Steaks &amp; Hoagies, St. Louis Drug 
Co., St. Petersburg Art Gallery, Chicago Radio Syndicate, New York Bakery and 
Paris Fashion Wigs. 
</P>
<P>
The name "Los Angeles" not only seems to lack a bit of magic in L.A., it's 
practically nonexistent elsewhere in the nation, though a football team in 
Anaheim insists on using it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few exceptions is Los Angeles Jewelers in Miami. A nice tribute to 
our diamond trade? Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Angel and my son is Angel," Los Angeles Jewelers owner Angel Meana 
said in Spanish via telephone. "We are two angels. So we use the name, 'The 
Angels.' " 
</P>
<P>
Feeling left out because you weren't considered for the jury in the Zsa Zsa 
Gabor trial? The firm of Acetta-Mosier, which is polling the public, will let 
you cast your vote for one dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Phone 1-900-400-6281 if you find Zsa Zsa innocent of the misdemeanor charges 
growing out of her confrontation with a Beverly Hills policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Phone 1-900-400-6282 if you find Zsa Zsa guilty -- even if it's just for 
misdemeanor over-dressing.

Richard Leishman knew the minute he leaped out of the plane that his first 
parachute jump would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided then that this was not for me," the 27-year-old Torrance man said 
later -- from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
Leishman, enrolled in a four-hour sky diving class in American Fork, Utah, was 
taking a 5,000-foot "assisted free fall." At 4,000 feet, two instructors 
falling with him pulled his parachute rip cord. 
</P>
<P>
But the chute malfunctioned and he was unable to control the parachute. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling about 20 m.p.h., Leishman slammed feet-first into the ravine, 
breaking both legs. "It didn't exactly tickle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He'll probably wear casts on his lower legs for about six months. But, in a few 
weeks, he hopes to return to his job at an aerospace firm here. And at least 
that old urge to sky-dive will have been quashed. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau has 
withdrawn the city's name as a candidate to host the 1992 Democratic National 
Convention, ostensibly because of the Democrats' insistence that the host put 
up $15 million in goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
No convention has played in L.A. since 1960 when the Democrats nominated John 
F. Kennedy at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Freeway City last seriously wooed the Democrats in 1976, and it would have 
been interesting to see how many of the advertising pitches from that year 
would have been retained for the 1992 bid. 
</P>
<P>
A few examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Conventions love sunshine. And L.A.'s got it everyday -- cloud-free and 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "A composer of national repute (will) write a special song for the 
convention." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Because L.A. has more cars per capita than any other major city in the 
world, there's far more personal transportation available." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The world-renowned Los Angeles freeway network shrinks miles into 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
And brains into quivering masses. 
</P>
<P>
Dining in the Beverly Hills Hotel recently, Barbara Rosenstein came across a 
menu item described as "an unctuous Madeira sauce with curry." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the waiter if they realized that 'unctuous' means greasy," she said, 
"and he said that the chef has a little difficulty with English." 
</P>
<P>
One can only hope that the chef spruces up on the language so that Beverly 
Hills doesn't get a reputation as a haven for unctuous spoons.

S.D. OFFICER WON'T FACE CHARGES IN FREEWAY ACCIDENT FATAL TO 3

No charges will be brought against a San Diego police officer who was operating 
a four-wheel-drive vehicle that crashed Aug. 31 on Interstate 8 in El Centro, 
killing three passengers, the Imperial County district attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Rausis, 28, a seven-year San Diego police veteran, was cleared of any 
wrongdoing in the accident after Dist. Atty. Larry Smith reviewed California 
Highway Patrol blood-alcohol and accident-collision reports sent to his office 
Wednesday. Rausis' blood-alcohol specimen measured 0.01% alcohol by weight, 
according to a spokeswoman for the CHP. If Rausis' blood-alcohol exceeded 
0.10%, the limit allow by California law, he could have faced felony charges of 
drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the reports indicated Rausis was not under the influence, and there 
was no evidence of excessive speed. 
</P>
<P>
"He may have been negligent, but there was no criminal culpability," said 
Smith, referring to Rausis' account of adjusting the tape player when the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Embarking on a hunting trip, Rausis reportedly swerved to avoid a slower-moving 
eastbound car when his Toyota 4-Runner overturned. Killed in the crash were 
Rausis' brother, Kenneth Richard Rausis, 38, of University City, his 
brother-in-law, John Leonard Walker, 27, of East San Diego and Michael Walker, 
40, who died two days later from injuries suffered in the one-car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicion of alcohol involvement stemmed from an ice chest containing beer that 
was reportedly scattered across I-8 after Rausis' car overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Rausis, who was back to work with the traffic unit Tuesday, was unavailable for 
comment.

CITY, LATINO FEDERATION MOVE CLOSER TO SETTLING MINORITY ELECTION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of San Diego and the Chicano Federation edged closer to a settlement 
of the federation's lawsuit over minority voting rights but failed to reach an 
agreement by late Tuesday evening, after a day of intensive negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which held three closed-door sessions to discuss the matter, ended 
the day by authorizing a "last and final offer" that will be discussed today in 
a settlement conference before U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sent our offer over to the other side and the judge," Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor said after the final closed-door discussion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks to Continue With Judge Present 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Meyer, attorney for the Chicano Federation, confirmed that the two 
sides had moved closer to a settlement, but she said they will continue 
negotiating with McCue present, probably this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to appear this afternoon before U.S. District Judge 
John S. Rhoades to report on their progress. Rhoades has threatened to postpone 
next Tuesday's City Council elections or invalidate them later because of 
issues raised by the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the federation's demand that the number of City Council seats be 
increased to at least 10 from the current eight to enhance minority clout. The 
method and timing of the redrawing of district boundaries, whether new 1990 
census data would be used in the redistricting and the date of elections in the 
new districts are also being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council offered to put the issue of increasing the number of 
districts to a vote on the June, 1990, ballot. However, the federation wants 
elections in the new districts, if approved by voters, held in 1991, two years 
before the council wants them held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Fees Are Also a Sticking Point 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also are negotiating over the how much the city will pay the 
federation in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
The federation originally sued in January, 1988, alleging that the city's 
two-tiered election system -- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs 
between the top two vote-getters -- unconstitutionally diluted the effect of 
Latino votes. 
</P>
<P>
The at-large runoffs were eliminated when San Diego voters approved a system of 
district-only elections in November. But last month, Rhoades allowed the 
federation to broaden its lawsuit to include the other issues.

DRUNK-DRIVER TREATMENT CENTER LOSES COUNTY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors canceled its contract Tuesday with 
a Van Nuys drunk-driving treatment program suspected of falsifying completion 
certificates and of other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussion, the board, with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn absent, voted 
unanimously to end its relationship with the Van Nuys branch of Driver Safety 
Schools, effective Oct. 12. Meanwhile, the county and other agencies, including 
police, are investigating operations at the company's six other branches, which 
also have county contracts. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have been referring the 800 people enrolled in the Van Nuys 
school to other court-ordered programs. Officials had stopped new referrals to 
Driver Safety School's six other sites until the review is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The company's other branches are in Canoga Park, Glendale, Beverly Hills, East 
Los Angeles, Huntington Park and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
A report to the supervisors by the county Department of Health Services 
recommended ending the contract but gave no reason for doing so. The director 
of the county's Office of Alcohol Programs declined to comment on why the 
contract was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
However, a July 16 accident involving a former Driver Safety Schools student 
has sparked an investigation of the school by the county, the Los Angeles 
Police Department, the state Department of Motor Vehicles and the California 
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in that crash, which occurred three days after the 
driver, Harry Bouboushian, received a certificate from Driver Safety Schools 
showing that he had completed a one-year treatment program that he entered 
after a previous drunk-driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian, 34, of Los Angeles, was charged with murder and felony drunk 
driving. A preliminary hearing was set for Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the school's records indicate that Bouboushian was 
given the certificate before he completed the program. Detective Richard Levos 
of the department's bunco forgery division said he is trying to determine 
whether there were other irregularities at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bloomberg, a member of the county's Commission on Alcoholism, said at 
least two students told county officials, in letters or sworn statements, that 
school employees offered to provide certificates as long as the program fees 
were paid -- regardless of whether the students attended the required sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Certificate for $1,000 
</P>
<P>
One student said he was offered a completion certificate for $1,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Driver Safety Schools, Arnold Abrams, could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Morse A. Taylor, declined to comment. However, Taylor previously 
acknowledged that Bouboushian received his certificate three weeks early but 
said Bouboushian completed all the necessary work. Taylor said that a school 
counselor sold a certificate for about $300 to a client who never attended the 
program, but that Abrams fired the employee when he learned of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Al Wright, director of the county's Office of Alcohol Programs, said his office 
is continuing its investigation into the six other sites operated by Driver 
Safety Schools. But he declined comment on Tuesday's action or the reasons 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The Bouboushian incident moved the Board of Supervisors to establish a panel 
last month to improve supervision of more than 130 similar drunk-driving 
programs countywide. About 50,000 people attend the privately run programs each 
year as part of the court-ordered penalty for drunk driving.

ASSEMBLY OKS PLAN TO REGISTER YOUNG VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite Republican arguments that it amounts to government coercion, 
legislation under which the state would pay San Fernando Valley high schools 
and community colleges to register students to vote won approval by the 
Assembly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, authored by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), the state 
would reimburse Valley schools for registering students who will be 18 by the 
next election. Schools would receive $1 for each voter registered. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said the bill, which creates a local pilot program that he would like 
to see expanded statewide, is simply an inexpensive way to encourage more young 
people to go to the polls. The bill still faces a vote in the Senate, probably 
today, before being sent to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"By having teachers pass out registration cards, it makes it easier to get them 
registered and . . . into the political process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office has estimated that 7,000 Valley residents will 
turn 18 next year, a Robbins aide said. Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana), who 
carried the bill in the Assembly, estimated that the pilot program would cost 
about $10,000. It would apply to three community colleges and about 20 high 
schools in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans, stressing that they had no objections to registering more 
18-year-olds, argued that public funds and employees should not be used to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) said it would result in some 
students being "coerced into registering. . . . A lot of people don't register 
to vote because they don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
Ellenor Howell, a spokeswoman for the California Federation of Republican 
Women, said voter registration efforts should be carried out by volunteer 
organizations, not the state. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins denied that students will be forced to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're doing is reimbursing schools for what they're going to spend. They 
might spend money on pamphlets. They might have a school dance where the price 
of admission is registering to vote." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Donations 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said state funds will be spent on the program "only technically." He 
said his office will work with the secretary of state to raise money from 
private businesses and only those funds will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the West 
Valley, said she favored the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added: "We also must prepare them to vote. Getting people to vote when 
they don't understand what they're voting about doesn't make much sense 
either." 
</P>
<P>
Although Republicans said they do not think that the bill will benefit 
Democrats more than Republicans, the Assembly vote was cast along party lines.

VIALS OF AIDS BLOOD SAMPLES LEFT UNLOCKED BEFORE THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS virus blood samples stolen from a Van Nuys testing firm over the weekend 
had been left outside the laboratory for a courier and were unsecured because a 
locking device was not working, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the door at ICS Home Health Services, in the 14900 block of Oxnard 
Street, was equipped with a device that could lock down the cooler holding the 
blood, which was from patients who tested positive for AIDS. The cooler could 
be released by a courier with a key. But the device was inoperative and Friday 
evening, the cooler was left "readily accessible to the public," police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The latch was not used," Detective Mel Arnold said. "The cooler was loose." 
</P>
<P>
The green-and-white Igloo cooler -- large enough to hold a six-pack of drinks 
-- apparently remained untended and undisturbed until at least Saturday night, 
the last time witnesses saw it. 
</P>
<P>
The cooler held six glass vials of blood taken from patients previously 
diagnosed as carrying the HIV virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, Lt. Fred Nixon said. The vials were to be further analyzed at a 
laboratory that ICS had contracted with to do AIDS testing. 
</P>
<P>
The cooler carried no warnings about its contents. Its theft was discovered 
Monday when ICS officials learned from the courier that the cooler had not been 
picked up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that someone who wanted the cooler probably took it and 
dumped the four-inch-long vials of blood, not realizing where the blood came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is some concern for where it was dumped," Arnold said. "We 
haven't found it." 
</P>
<P>
State and Los Angeles County health authorities were alerted about the blood 
theft, officials said. Toby Staheli, spokeswoman for the county Department of 
Health Services, said the agency will check ICS' handling of the blood but 
added that apparently no laws or codes govern procedures for shipping blood 
samples by courier. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Sawada, ICS pharmacy manager, said that leaving the cooler untended and 
outside for the courier is routine in the blood-testing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal with patients that need laboratory work done," she said. Blood samples 
are left "in a manner that the laboratory can procure it. It is an industry 
standard." 
</P>
<P>
Sawada declined further comment on the procedure and on why the locking device 
was not used on the cooler. According to police reports, parts on the L-shaped 
latch device did not fit on the cooler properly. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mack, assistant clinic director of Edelman Health Center in Hollywood, 
which does more AIDS testing than any other clinic in Southern California, 
agreed that ICS used accepted procedures with the cooler. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Standard Practice' 
</P>
<P>
"It is a standard practice to leave containers out for couriers to pick up if 
the pickup is to be done after hours," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mack said, Edelman Health Center does not follow that standard. 
Instead, clinic employees personally hand blood shipments to lab couriers. "We 
are dealing with blood that is contaminated," he said. "We don't want anything 
to happen to our blood samples." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Ward, a medical epidemiologist with the AIDS program at the national 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said the stolen blood would be 
dangerous only if it contaminated someone's bloodstream through injection or a 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not use it as a poison in the sense of pouring it into something and 
having someone drink it," Ward said. "The only way that the virus could infect 
someone else is if it is injected into them or it breaks the protective layer 
of the body," such as through an open wound. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest risk might be for whomever stole it -- if they broke one of the 
vials and cut themselves," Ward added. "Or if they threw it somewhere and 
someone inadvertently cut themselves on the glass" from the vials.

L.A.-PALMDALE RAIL PLAN SIDETRACKED BY CONFUSED COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consideration of a commuter rail line between the San Fernando Valley and 
Palmdale was postponed Tuesday for further clarification by a thoroughly 
confused Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like some kind of a lame-brained idea," said Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, who represents the northeast Valley. "We need some pictures, some 
idea of what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council, Mayor Tom Bradley and council President John 
Ferraro asked that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission be urged to 
study such a service. They said it could relieve congestion on the Antelope 
Valley Freeway and help spur development of Palmdale Airport, where the city 
owns 18,000 undeveloped acres, which officials have long envisioned as a major 
city airport in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also suggested that trains could run along the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, in the right of way, and that perhaps a private contractor would be 
interested in developing and running the system. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Bradley nor Ferraro were on hand Tuesday to explain the proposal, 
and council members expressed concern about how it fits with other mass 
transportation proposals, including the East-West Valley light-rail line and a 
proposed high-speed train that could connect Palmdale with Las Vegas. Bernardi 
suggested that installing a rail line next to the freeway would cause lengthy 
traffic delays during construction. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, chairwoman of the council's Commerce, Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, and Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the 
Transportation Committee, said they had not been given details of the mayor's 
proposal. The council referred the proposal to both committees for review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) described the mayor's 
idea as a thinly veiled attempt to attract the bullet train to Palmdale over 
other destinations such as Anaheim, Ontario, Palm Springs or Victorville. The 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, which Katz heads, is scheduled 
to vote on a proposed route in October. 
</P>
<P>
"They know that we're not going to run a train to Palmdale if there's nothing 
going out to Palmdale," Katz said. "I don't find it a particularly serious 
proposition at this point. There's no financing for it."

But Bill Bicker, the mayor's transportation coordinator, said Bradley merely 
wanted to expand on the train commission's efforts. He said the mayor hopes to 
persuade private developers to finance, build and run the commuter service. A 
similar effort is being made to use private sources to build the bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's proposal is supported by the city Department of Airports, which 
hopes that Palmdale Airport will become a regional airport, relieving crowding 
at Los Angeles International Airport, said department spokesman Lee Nichols. 
There are no scheduled commercial flights from Palmdale, but America West 
tentatively plans to begin daily service from Palmdale to Las Vegas in January.

ALL SPRUCED UP AND NO ONE TO TEACH -- YET 
</P>

<P>
It was lonely for the staff of Parthenia Street School on Tuesday, the first 
day of the fall term for most of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers arrived early, finished plans for their first day's lessons and 
touched up classroom bulletin boards. Custodians made a last sweep of the 
grounds, including the newly painted hopscotch grids. The flag was hoisted. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're missing are the students," Jackie Harris, the elementary school's 
principal, said as she walked the halls, which remained empty all day. 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, the school -- which was closed in 1984 because of declining 
enrollment in the area -- got a fresh coat of paint, about 100 new shrubs and a 
full complement of teachers and administrators after the school board's 
decision last spring to reopen the facility to relieve overcrowding at five 
nearby elementary schools. The refurbishing cost about $850,000, school board 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But it will take a few days before students begin arriving at Parthenia. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one student show up by mistake this morning" due to a school bus 
driver's error, Harris said. The girl was eventually sent to Langdon Avenue 
School, where she belonged. "The rest will probably start arriving Wednesday 
after the other schools count the number of their students and send us the 
overflow." 
</P>
<P>
Parthenia is the first school in the San Fernando Valley to be reopened to 
accommodate the district's growing number of school-age children. Districtwide, 
officials expect the number of students to increase from the spring semester 
enrollment of about 595,000 to slightly more than 600,000 students this fall. 
Officials predict that growth in the district will continue for several more 
years due to a rise in the birthrate. 
</P>
<P>
Parthenia is the only school in the district to restrict enrollment to students 
from crowded schools. Students at Parthenia will come from the first through 
sixth grades at neighboring schools in Sepulveda and Van Nuys rather than from 
the immediate neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The school will accommodate students from Langdon Avenue, Noble Avenue, 
Plummer, Valerio Street and Hazeltine Avenue schools, which are full, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
So while teachers at most of the district's 600 or so schools spent the morning 
explaining classroom rules and memorizing names, teachers at Parthenia simply 
waited. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot quieter than what you'd expect on the first day," said teacher 
Joy Steinhardt -- herself a graduate of the school, who was a fourth-grade 
student the day the then-new school opened in 1958. 
</P>

exception was Veronica Castaneda, 7, sent there in error. Principal Jackie 
Harris, left, conferred with Veronica and busing supervisor Jim Sweeney. BORIS

bus for the trip to the right school.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI ASKS L.A. TO REVOKE DUMP'S PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called Tuesday for the Planning 
Commission to revoke the city land-use permit for Lopez Canyon Landfill on the 
grounds that the dump is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Under an ordinance approved by the council in 1985, the commission may revoke 
any conditional-use permit that allows conditions affecting health and safety 
or creating a public nuisance, Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone familiar with the operational history of Lopez knows that it fits the 
public nuisance definition to a 'T,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Bernardi cited alleged violations in excess of the existing 
permit, including longer dumping hours, more dump trucks and higher garbage 
mounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Sanitation, which runs the dump, maintains that it is operated 
safely and that all dumps cause some hardship to surrounding residents.

DEVELOPERS OFFER REDESIGN IF PROJECT CAN BE 6 STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developers of a proposed three-story shopping center, office and theater 
complex near a residential area in Encino offered Tuesday to redesign the 
project to be farther from neighboring houses if it could be built three 
stories taller. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, attorney for developers David Roberts and Jona Goldrich, 
said the six-story configuration would place the project 115 feet from an 
adjoining residential neighborhood on Moorpark Avenue. The three-story 
configuration would place the project 15 feet away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the project, which would be on Ventura Boulevard between 
Hayvenhurst and Libbit avenues, would remain at 375,000 square feet in either 
configuration, Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik made the announcement to members of the Encino Property Owners Assn. 
Some members of the group expressed opposition to the project and said they 
were concerned about the impact on traffic and noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The $116-million project would include a six-screen cinema with 1,900 
underground parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the project conforms to the city plan for Encino and applicable 
zoning laws, the developers have been ordered to prepare an environmental 
impact report, which could take up to nine months, Los Angeles city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Miscikowski, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, 
who represents the area where the project is located, said the developers might 
also be ordered to spend "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in road 
improvements, including street widening.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SMALL FITS IN WITH REST OF TERRIFIC 22 AREA PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To some, the inclusion of senior Errol Small among the top 22 players in the 
Southland in a recent poll of college recruiting services seemed odd. 
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame High tailback rushed for 471 yards in 84 carries during his 
junior year. Three backs in the Valley gained more than three times as many 
yards last season. Small's yardage -- most of which came against Division VII 
opponents -- didn't even place him among the top 20 Valley-area running backs. 
This was one of the Terrific 22? 
</P>
<P>
Small posted a resounding rebuttal Friday at Alemany, scoring on runs of 57, 
seven, and 89 yards and intercepting two passes. He also ran 75 yards for an 
apparent score in the second quarter, but the play was nullified by a holding 
penalty. In all, he gained 213 yards in 14 carries -- a 15.2-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen one individual have such a great game on both sides of the 
ball," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The Alemany defense was not baffled by the Knights' offensive strategy -- 14 of 
Notre Dame's 32 plays were runs by Small. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys at the point of attack but we didn't tackle well at all," Alemany 
Coach Pat Blackburn said. "You've got to take him on and wrap him up. A lot of 
our guys were diving at him and if you do that, he's going to run right through 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys at running back are about five dollars a dozen instead of a dime. 
They're a rare commodity. It isn't too often you find a back like that." 
</P>
<P>
Small likes to think of himself as more bash than flash. He uses his 6-foot-3, 
205-pound frame to steamroller defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned to deliver the blow instead of take it," he said. "I'm using my 
defensive mentality on offense. Before coming up to the tackle I used to slow 
down and cover up. Now, I'm just full speed ahead and take what they give me. 
Try and make some room. Go through someone." 
</P>
<P>
Teammates nicknamed Small "E-rock" because taking a shot from him is tantamount 
to smacking into a granite slab at full tilt. Alemany sophomore Brian Brison 
experienced the sensation Friday night. After catching a six-yard pass over the 
middle, Brison found himself between E-rock and a hard place and was leveled. 
</P>
<P>
Said Notre Dame tackle John DiSante of the hit: "Looking at Brison was like, 
'Hey, this is varsity.' Errol pretty much told him, 'This is my house. This is 
Notre Dame defense. This is the way we hit and you better get used to it 
tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Small's offensive hit parade began on his fifth carry. After opening with gains 
of two, three, five and eight yards, he took a pitch from quarterback Greg 
Andrachick at the Notre Dame 43-yard line with 4:05 to play in the first 
quarter and darted untouched up the right sideline for a score. 
</P>
<P>
With his team leading, 14-0, midway through the second quarter, Andrachick 
found Guillermo Eguez on a 40-yard pass down the middle to put the Knights at 
the Alemany seven. On the following play, Small juked his way into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany answered with a six-play, 45-yard drive that Small squelched from his 
strong-safety position when he made a diving interception. 
</P>
<P>
On Notre Dame's second possession of the third quarter, Small made his only 
blunder of the game, fumbling the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:31 to play and Notre Dame at its 11, Small took a handoff and broke 
several tackles at the line of scrimmage. Maintaining his footing, he stumbled 
through the secondary, regained his balance and raced 89 yards for the game's 
final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany made its last extended drive of the game -- a seven-play march to the 
Notre Dame 22 that ended when Small picked off a pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Small, who was named player of the week by the San Fernando Valley chapter of 
the National Football Foundation, hopes to attend USC and eventually study 
psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought about that career as a kid," he said. "I just like to see 
what makes people run." 
</P>
<P>
For Small, all it takes is a football.

More than two years after his death, pop artist Andy Warhol is making waves in 
London. Six Warhol exhibitions opened this month. Also taking place: a 
retrospective of his avant-garde films and a two-day conference on his film 
making at the National Film Theater; a six-week series of lectures at the 
Chelsea School of Art and Design and, next month, a dance at Sadler's Wells 
inspired by his helium-filled floating silver pillows. "I cannot remember such 
a concentration on a single artist before, and it reflects Warhol's stature as 
one of the great artists since the Second World War," said Andrew Dempsey, 
assistant director of the Hayward Gallery, which is staging Britain's first 
comprehensive retrospective Warhol exhibition. ALEENE MacMINN

Testing the Waters: NBC will conduct a test in October and November to study 
the possibility of changing prime time on the West Coast from the current 8-11 
p.m. to an earlier 7-10 p.m. slot. The move has been requested by some 
affiliates who feel an earlier start would bring heftier ratings. Others oppose 
the change because it would interfere with the placement of their access 
programming. Some syndication companies -- who provide access shows -- also 
frown on the proposal. The results of the study will be made known on Jan. 1.

A parade of little girls has been streaming to the Golden Theater in New York 
this week, all hoping to be Broadway's new Annie in "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's 
Revenge," the new musical about the world's most famous orphan. Annie must be 
between 3-feet-10 and 4-feet-4, sing loudly and clearly, be able to act and tap 
dance, look 10 or 11 years old and, of course, not be afraid of dogs. The 
$7-million musical is to open March 1 on Broadway. Most of the young hopefuls 
weren't even born when the original "Annie" opened in New York in 1977. It ran 
2,377 performances before closing in January, 1983. The show's first star, 
Andrea McArdle, is now 25, married and the mother of a year-old daughter. She 
last appeared on Broadway in "Starlight Express" in 1987. ALEENE MacMINN

Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman lost a court battle in Stockholm Tuesday 
for symbolic damages of one crown -- 15 cents -- from the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet, which he claimed had violated the copyright of his memoirs. 
Bergman and his publishers, Nordstedts, took the national daily to court two 
weeks ago, alleging that it had published an article based on unedited material 
from his biography "Laterna Magica" before it was published in 1987.ALEENE

Wait a minute. Did Marlon Brando tell the Toronto Globe and Mail the other day 
that his just-completed film "The Freshman" was a stinker and because of it, he 
was retiring? What he meant was it has a "screamingly funny" script, featuring 
"wonderfully comedic portrayals," "imaginative" costuming, "perfect sets" and 
the best crew he had ever had the pleasure of working with. 
</P>

Retirement? Au contraire. Brando says that if he's offered a role in a sequel, 
he'll be happy to accept. At least, that's how the 65-year-old star feels in a 
lengthy apology released through his publicist. Brando, blaming his dyspeptic 
comments to the Toronto paper on "trying times of a personal nature," had 
praise for director Andy Bergman and discounted his hasty put-down of "The 
Freshman." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, I was wrong about the quality of the picture," Brando said of "The 
Freshman." "It is clear to me that the movie contains moments of high comedy 
that will be remembered for decades." ALEENE MacMINN

POGUES STIR UP DISCONTENT WITHOUT THEIR LEAD SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gee, it was sure nice to see the Pogues last Wednesday night at the Starlight 
Bowl in Balboa Park, opening for Bob Dylan. It would have been even nicer had 
lead singer Shane MacGowan been there, too. 
</P>
<P>
But the London-based Irish pub band walked on stage without MacGowan and 
stumbled through an awkward 30-minute set, prompting one disgruntled fan to 
remark, "Seeing the Pogues without Shane MacGowan is like seeing the Doors 
without Jim Morrison." 
</P>
<P>
That analogy might be a little hyperbolic, but it is true that MacGowan is not 
just the Pogues' lead singer, he's a flamboyant front man and writer of most of 
the band's material, an infectious blend of traditional Celtic pub music and 
ferocious punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
And, since the group had known for at least a week that MacGowan wouldn't be 
there -- he fell ill on the eve of their U.S. tour and remained at home while 
his compadres flew to the States -- the proper thing to do would have been to 
either postpone the date or at least alert the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Or the promoter, for that matter. John Nelson of Bill Silva Presents was as 
unaware of MacGowan's impending absence as anyone else, and, when he did find 
out, it was only a few hours before show time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I didn't see (MacGowan) after the sound check, I walked up to the tour 
manager and said, 'Aren't you missing a band member?' " Nelson recalled. "He 
said, 'Oh, yeah, Shane's been ill; he just got out of the hospital, and we 
think he'll be rejoining us next week.' 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him why he didn't let us know in advance, and he just said, 'Um, I 
don't know.' And I told him that, while it was too late to do anything now, I 
was very disappointed in the band's failure to communicate with us. It wasn't 
fair to us, and it certainly wasn't fair to the fans." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual "New Sounds of the Sixties" benefit concert for San Diego 
State University's financially strapped student radio station, KCR, will be 
held Saturday at Montezuma Hall, on the SDSU campus. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-hour concert, which starts at 1 p.m., will showcase nearly 2 dozen 
underground rock bands from around the country "that have been influenced in 
some way, shape, or form by the music of the 1960s -- new, original-music bands 
whose sound at one point might have been classified as Mod, or surf, or garage 
or psychedelic, but has since mutated into other things," according to 
organizer Bartley Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Mendoza's goal: to raise enough money through ticket sales to 
cover KCR's operating costs for yet another year. KCR, which is broadcast 
throughout the SDSU campus at 550 AM and elsewhere in the city at 98.9 FM on 
Cox Cable and 96.5 FM on Southwestern Cable, has long had problems meeting its 
expenses, which average about $4,500 a semester. These problems intensified 
last spring, when SDSU's Associated Students, KCR's primary financial 
benefactor since the station first went on the air in 1969, voted to cut off 
its funding in a dispute concerning management of the station. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike commercial radio stations, KCR doesn't play the hits," said Mendoza, 
whose own Mod revival band, Manual Scan, is one of 11 San Diego groups 
scheduled to perform at Saturday's benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
"They play stuff by all sorts of underground bands that are signed to tiny 
independent labels and whose music is a lot more adventurous, a lot more 
creative, but, sadly, a lot less commercial than that of the big bands signed 
to the major labels," Mendoza said. "And this is our way of returning the 
favor, of quite literally paying them back." 
</P>
<P>
Among the out-of-town performers will be the Funseekers from Minneapolis, 
Corporate Humour from St. Louis and New Jersey's Thee Mod Fun. Locals include 
the Trebles, the Sharkskins and the Towne Criers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like Dick Clark's 'Cavalcade of Stars,' " Mendoza said. "Everyone 
comes out and does 30 minutes of their best stuff. And, in addition to raising 
money for KCR, we're giving some of San Diego's best original-music bands some 
badly needed exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Bands like the Towne Criers are simply incredible, and yet there's no room for 
them on the local nightclub scene because they don't play the Top 40." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Michelob Street Scene '89 last Saturday night in the Gaslamp 
Quarter was "successful beyond our wildest expectations," promoter Rob Hagey 
reports. Total attendance was 17,500, up from 10,000 at last year's Street 
Scene and a good 5,000 more than Hagey had expected. "Having those kinds of 
numbers shows us that there's a great need in San Diego for this event," Hagey 
said, adding that "next year, we're looking at expanding it to two days." 
Expansion plans, however, are contingent on "getting the city more involved," 
Hagey said, ideally through partial subsidization. 
</P>
<P>
As advertised, the crowd at Street Scene was treated to 5 1/2 hours of 
continuous live music, from rock, blues and jazz to reggae, Cajun and "world 
beat," by 18 acts performing on six stages. But there were also several 
unadvertised specials. Among them: a surprise appearance by San Diego roots 
rockers the Beat Farmers, joining fellow locals Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper on 
stage for a rousing encore rendition of "The King of Sleaze," a tune off their 
new "Poor and Famous" album, co-written by Nixon and Beat Farmer Country Dick 
Montana; and Bad English, the hot new rock 'n' roll supergroup consisting of 
former members of the Babys and Journey, plowing through the crowd in a car for 
a grand stage entrance that was captured on film for their upcoming video, 
"Smile." 
</P>
<P>
On tonight's episode of "Celebrity Grill," a weekly interview program on North 
County news/talk radio station KVSD-AM (1000) that airs Wednesdays from 8:30-10 
p.m., host Les Burden Jr. will be grilling the wives of two local rock 
celebrities -- Mrs. Mojo Nixon and Mrs. Country Dick Montana. Should be 
interesting, since Country Dick claims he isn't married. Tune in, however, and 
you'll hear a woman by the name of "Anita Dick Montana" beg to differ, promises 
Mrs. Nixon, nee Adaire Newman: "She's going to tell all, about the kids and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for David Byrne's Oct. 15 show at Starlight 
Bowl. Byrne has taken a temporary leave of absence from the Talking Heads to 
tour the country on his own to promote his upcoming solo album of Caribbean 
music, "Rei Momo." 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Meatloaf, tonight at Iguanas in Tijuana; 
the Jeff Healey Band, Thursday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Tower of Power, 
also Thursday, at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Bobby (Blue) Bland, 
Friday at the Bacchanal; Johnny Winter, Saturday, also at the Bacchanal; Dwight 
Yoakam and the Desert Rose Band, Sunday, at the Starlight Bowl; and Buddy Guy, 
also Sunday, at the Bacchanal.

COCKER STILL ROILING AND BOILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the devastating Joe Cocker imitation John Belushi used to do on 
"Saturday Night Live": twitching movements, bleary eyes and all? Remember the 
time Joe himself -- good-naturedly but misguidedly -- joined Belushi for a 
round of dueling Cockers, apparently oblivious to the fact that at least as 
many people were laughing at him as with him? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Cocker can have the last laugh. With Belushi a long-gone victim of the 
kind of excesses Cocker has conquered, the mad-dog Englishman was a performer 
at the peak of his powers Monday at the Universal Amphitheatre. That famous 
phlegmy, nodal, raspy roar is better than ever, as is his way with, around and 
through a song. Even the cheap sentimentality of "Up Where We Belong" and "You 
Are So Beautiful" came out like real passion. (Of course, he could sing the 
college football results in Sanskrit and make it seem like real passion.) 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, though, there was only a little cheap sentimentality Monday. The 
generous two-hour set was dominated by the kind of roiling, boiling 
R&amp;B-based rockers that made Cocker famous. Selections both old ("Feelin' 
Alright," "The Letter," the once-again-familiar "A Little Help From My 
Friends") and new (a straight take on Leonard Cohen's wry "I'm Your Man") 
benefited from the alive playing of the 13-piece band, which included long-time 
Cocker mainstay Chris Stainton on keyboards and the unsurpassed Memphis Horns. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Cocker himself -- singing up a storm, leaping with joy to close each 
song, sincerely grateful for the reception from the largely neat, largely 
middle-aged but hardly restrained audience -- who made the show happen. Why, he 
made aging seem like something to look forward to. And how many other survivors 
of the Woodstock Wonder Years can say that? STEVE HOCHMAN

CONFEREES OK SWEEPING LEGISLATIVE ETHICS MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to clean up the Legislature's image, leaders of both parties reached 
agreement Tuesday on a wide-ranging ethics plan that would ban honorariums for 
legislators while setting the stage for a hefty pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitutional amendment, which would be placed before the voters 
next June, is designed to curtail a variety of practices that have brought 
criticism on lawmakers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Among its provisions, the measure would limit the acceptance of gifts by 
legislators, restrict lobbying by former lawmakers for a year and require 
legislative committees to hold their meetings in public. 
</P>
<P>
The new ethical standards for legislators would be linked to the creation of an 
independent salary commission that would have the sole authority to decide on 
the level of compensation lawmakers should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators now receive $40,816 a year plus a tax-free expense allowance of $88 
a day. Some legislators have suggested that their salaries should be more in 
line with the $84,765 paid to Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great deal of movement forward on legislation which will open up the 
process of the Legislature and will restore a degree of confidence on the part 
of the people that our compensation primarily comes from them," said Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), author of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 5 to 0, a two-house conference committee that included the 
legislative leadership of both parties adopted a final version of the proposed 
constitutional amendment. The measure now goes to the Assembly and Senate, 
where it must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in each house before it can go 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), a committee member, did not 
cast a vote for the constitutional amendment, saying he wanted to study the 
final version. But later, the Speaker pledged through a spokesman to sponsor 
the measure on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders hope the measure will improve the image of the Legislature, 
which has been tarnished by a lengthy federal investigation into political 
corruption. So far, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) has been indicted on 
charges of racketeering, extortion and money-laundering. At least five other 
elected officials continue to be subjects of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gifts and Payments 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and many other legislators have regularly accepted thousands of dollars 
in honorariums, gifts and other payments from special-interest groups that 
stand to benefit from the Legislature's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conference committee took steps to end many perceived abuses by 
lawmakers, they balked at adopting conflict-of-interest provisions for 
legislators that now apply to local elected officials throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, legislators are prohibited from voting on matters that 
affect their own financial interests. However, there is no penalty for 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
California Common Cause, the citizens lobbying group, urged the conference 
committee to remove the legislators' exemption from penalties. Instead, the 
panel included a vague provision requiring the Legislature to enact a statute 
to "strengthen the enforcement of existing laws." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loose Ends 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the provisions of the constitutional amendment would require 
the Legislature's adoption of statutes to spell out details of the new ethics 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said he expects the Legislature to pass at least four bills well before 
next June's election defining such matters as the ban on honorariums, the limit 
on gifts and the open-meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The constitutional amendment is very important, but it's the first step," 
Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating the delicate nature of the conference committee's deliberations, 
the panel included the top leadership of both houses. Roberti, Brown, Assembly 
GOP Leader Ross Johnson and Senate Republican Caucus Chairman John Doolittle 
were among those on the committee. Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy also sat 
in on most of the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the proposal would: 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit members of the Legislature from accepting honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
* Require the Legislature to enact laws banning or limiting legislators' 
acceptance of gifts from sources that have an interest in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit legislative committees from meeting in private except to discuss 
personnel matters, security or litigation. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit former lawmakers from lobbying the Legislature for a year after 
leaving office. Current members of the Legislature, however, would be exempt 
from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
* Ban legislators from receiving income from a lobbyist or lobbying firm. 
However, income earned by a legislator's spouse would not be covered by the 
prohibition.

WEST GERMANS EAGER TO HIRE NEW ARRIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
VILSHOFEN, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The refugees from Communist East Germany pitching their tents at this impromptu 
camp near the Danube River sense that the freewheeling, capitalistic society 
they have opted for might have some perils. 
</P>
<P>
But few, it would appear, expected that their very first encounters would be 
with headhunters. 
</P>
<P>
For West German headhunters -- Western jargon for employment solicitors -- have 
descended on the camp in Vilshofen and the others around Passau in Bavaria, 
offering jobs to the newcomers, with apartments included. 
</P>
<P>
"A young couple arrived here yesterday morning," remarked camp director 
Friedrich-Wilhelm Moog as he made his rounds Tuesday. "I introduced them to a 
local hotel owner, and he hired them, with living quarters. So they had a job, 
home and were serving guests by evening." 
</P>
<P>
The two bulletin boards in the 800-bed tent camp are cluttered 
</P>
<P>
with the tacked-up blandishments of prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
There is one from a butcher in Munich, another from a plastics company with 
offices in five cities, calls for physiotherapists, people who can work with 
the aged, carpenters, bricklayers, stone masons, mechanics, construction 
workers, technicians of various sorts. 
</P>
<P>
And many of the refugees are qualified to respond. Most are young and skilled 
craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of them have pretty good qualifications, even if they haven't 
been trained in the latest techniques," said Moog, who has been sending the 
newcomers out to more permanent locations at a rapid rate. "Some of the 
refugees can even pick and choose -- doctors and nurses are in demand 
everywhere in West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by one of the headhunters, Elisabeth Simon, the head nurse 
of the university hospital in Ulm in southern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking for 10 nurses for our hospital," she said during a break between 
questioning newcomers. "We already have five nurses from East Germany, and they 
are very professional. It is good for our West German nurses to see how well 
the others do. I would sign up any I can find on the spot, with apartment 
included." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Simon's prospects were only so-so, however. "I found one 
nurse from Magdeburg," she said, "but she already had plans to go to Cologne." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the nursing headhunter had found a 23-year-old nurse named 
Brigitte who was still thinking over the offer -- though the newcomer said she 
was inclined to accept a similar offer from a hospital in Augsburg. 
</P>
<P>
"My boyfriend, who came with me, is a bricklayer," Brigitte said, "and he would 
like to live closer to Munich, though I don't think we could afford to live in 
Munich itself." 
</P>
<P>
Brigitte said she and her 25-year-old boyfriend had already given much thought 
to where they would work and live in West Germany. And their departure is 
reflective of the quality of worker that East Germany is losing during the 
refugee exodus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filling the Void 
</P>
<P>
Also, Brigitte's story is emblematic of the consequent gain to West Germany -- 
for, Moog points out, the newcomers are filling the void in the demographic gap 
here and will help pay taxes supporting the elderly in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Brigitte said she spent three years in nursing school in Brandenburg and was 
working in a home for the elderly in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my parents, and I had a good childhood," she said. "I don't have any 
bad memories. The older people are satisfied in East Germany. They have a 
house, a car, maybe a weekend cottage. But the young people want to move 
around, to be free, to travel. I had a good job and a three-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say exactly what I disliked. But it was the (Communist) party 
people always putting you down. The government acts afraid. They don't 
understand the hopes of the young people in the country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has No Regrets 
</P>
<P>
So Brigitte left a good job and her family for the West -- and, as yet, she has 
no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my sister to come," she recalled, "and she wanted to, but her husband 
wished to stay. She was happy that I got out. Her only fear was that I might be 
caught and sent back to East Berlin. I really have no fears now about the 
future here." 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, Bertram, is a 28-year-old roofer who fled with his wife and 
child and his brother's family, a total of six. 
</P>
<P>
Busily filling out his documents, he said: "The main thing I didn't like was 
that the government was always saying something that you couldn't believe. When 
we were growing up, they always said that the Western European countries were 
our enemy, that the Soviets were good and the Americans bad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Propaganda' 
</P>
<P>
"But my father warned me not to believe all the propaganda, and as I got older 
I could make up my own mind. I served in the army for a couple of years and 
didn't like that -- more propaganda. I came to believe that someone in the East 
is not much different than someone in the West. I'm a roofer. He's a roofer. 
What's the difference? Only politicians believe there's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to get a job in his trade and has asked to go to Stuttgart, the 
thriving capital of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
</P>
<P>
A typical young mother in the process of moving from East to West is 
23-year-old Ulla, with a 2-year-old baby in a carriage. 
</P>
<P>
She worked in an electronics factory, while her 30-year-old husband was a house 
painter. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason we crossed the border," she said, "was so that my daughter 
could grow up and get the education she wanted. We didn't want her to be told 
what to do by the government. We wanted her to have her own personality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Straight From Vacation 
</P>
<P>
She added: "We were a group of four families. Three wanted to leave, and one 
wanted to stay. We had been applying to leave legally for three years, with no 
success. So, when we were coming back from vacation in Romania and heard on 
Radio Free Europe that the border was open, we suddenly decided to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to having an apartment with a washing machine," Ulla 
said. "That we never had in East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the youth and vitality of the newcomers is evident in the camps in 
Bavaria -- Moog estimates the average age of his charges at 27, not counting 
children. 
</P>
<P>
One gray-haired gentleman surveying the bulletin board was approached and asked 
if he was perhaps an older refugee. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, I'm here trying to hire a landscape gardener," replied the aging 
headhunter.

<P>
Mayor Edward I. Koch and Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins were 
locked in a tight struggle in New York's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday 
night, but three local television stations projected that Dinkins would emerge 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Former prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani took a strong lead over cosmetics 
millionaire Ronald Lauder in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Koch was seeking a historic fourth term at City Hall, while Dinkins was trying 
to become New York's first black chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cautiously Optimistic' 
</P>
<P>
"We are cautiously optimistic," said Bill Lynch, who managed the Dinkins 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"People really wish to heal wounds," Dinkins said in a television interview 
after the polls closed. "I always had great faith in the people in our city. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not the polarization some people seem to think. People want to heal 
the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison J. Goldin, the city's comptroller, and businessman Richard Ravitch ran 
far behind among Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, who established a national reputation fighting drugs and white-collar 
crime, swept past Lauder among all groups of voters. Lauder, a former 
ambassador to Austria and the heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, spent 
almost $12 million wooing Republicans. Lauder will remain on the November 
ballot as the candidate of New York's Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
A New York Newsday/WNBC-TV exit poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times showed 
only one out of 50 Republican voters said they were influenced by Lauder's huge 
television campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solid Support From Blacks 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, 62, a barber's son who sold shopping bags on the streets of Harlem 
when he was 8 years old, fashioned his predicted victory with solid support in 
the black communities, strong backing from Latino voters and a 
higher-than-expected share of the anti-Koch white vote. 
</P>
<P>
As predicted, the Democratic primary was defined by constituency politics. The 
New York Newsday/WNBC-TV exit poll showed that Dinkins received close to 100% 
of the black vote. Koch won about two-thirds of white voters, both Jews and 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
What made the election so close was Dinkins' strength among younger and more 
liberal white Democrats, who said they had an unfavorable opinion of the often 
flamboyant three-term mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the Democrats surveyed by WNBC-TV and New York Newsday said 
that New York was ready to join such cities as Los Angeles, Philadelphia, 
Detroit and Atlanta in electing a black mayor. Among Koch's supporters, about 
half expressed that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of voters said they believed things had gotten worse in New York 
City over the last year, and in a clear message for the November election, they 
considered crime and drugs the city's chief problems. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the primary was a referendum on Koch, who has managed to 
dominate political discourse in the nation's largest city for a dozen years. 
Brash, thin-skinned, constantly campaigning even in non-election years, the 
mayor staged one of the biggest comebacks in New York's political history. 
</P>
<P>
How bad was it at the beginning? "It's Koch against Koch, and Koch is losing," 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who remained neutral in the Democratic primary, said in 
surveying the difficult road ahead for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Campaign Start 
</P>
<P>
In the face of huge negative job approval ratings, the 64-year-old mayor began 
his television commercials ahead of his competition, stressing the city's 
so-far successful effort to build more than $5 billion in low-income housing 
through the words of minority construction workers. In these commercials, the 
mayor's face was tucked away in one corner, so small it almost took a 
magnifying glass to find it. 
</P>
<P>
As the campaign progressed, the commercials got tougher. One ad featured a 
white police officer who was shot and paralyzed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Koch is a mayor who is good for our cops and our kids, too," the policeman 
told potential voters. "He is a mayor who knows that the things that unite us 
outweigh the things that divide us. He hurts when we hurt. He smiles when we 
smile. He leads when others lead." 
</P>
<P>
Koch did not directly attack Dinkins, in part, strategists said, for fear of 
alienating black Democrats in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the primary, Dinkins ran on the premise he was the candidate best 
able to bring the city together again. He campaigned with the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson in an effort to energize the black community, with Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) in East Harlem seeking Latino votes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Theme of Unification 
</P>
<P>
But his commercials carried a consistent theme: He could unify the city. They 
stressed he had fought hard against bigotry all his life, that he had received 
death threats after denouncing the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, who had disparaged 
Jews. Seeking to make inroads in Koch's traditionally strong Jewish 
constituency, Dinkins told voters he had traveled to West Germany with a 
delegation of the American Jewish Congress to protest President Ronald Reagan's 
visit to a Nazi cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to overcome charges by Koch supporters that he wasn't tough enough to 
run New York City, the candidate's campaign slogan proclaimed: "The type of man 
he is, the kind of mayor he'll be . . . the quiet courage that proves you don't 
have to be loud to be strong." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to elections in some other cities, the issue of racial conflict in 
New York grew somewhat muted in the closing days of the campaign after the 
firestorm of Bensonhurst, the white Brooklyn neighborhood where a black youth 
was killed after being confronted by a white gang. Following the death, both 
Koch and Dinkins made a sustained effort to keep polarization under control, 
rather than try to openly exploit it as in mayoral elections in Philadelphia 
and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of the primary, Koch ran as a unifier, superimposing his own 
buoyant personality upon the Manhattan borough president's theme of healing. 
The mayor even proposed, and Dinkins agreed, to appear together at a 
post-primary unity conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, after casting his ballot, Koch emerged from the voting booth 
flashing a thumb's up sign. He later visited one of his phone banks and took 
the telephone from a volunteer and talked to a family, trying to convince them 
to vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he turned philosophical. "I expect to win. It's quite possible to lose," 
he told reporters. "Very few people in this country have had as marvelous a 
political life as I had."

KING HOSPITAL DEFICIENCIES CITED BY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

State health officials issued a 90-page report Tuesday citing serious 
deficiencies in health care practices at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. The deficiencies could threaten the hospital's Medicare funding and its 
state license, according to federal and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
King, a 430-bed hospital operated by Los Angeles County in Watts, was reported 
to have suffered major breakdowns in infection control, quality assurance, 
nursing, dietary care, and administration by state health inspectors who spent 
a week at King in June spot-checking the hospital's entire operation. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors cited instances in which one patient developed malnutrition 
while in the hospital's care and other patients languished for hours in the 
emergency room without care. Others, believed to have infectious diseases, were 
not properly isolated, it was reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Records Misfiled 
</P>
<P>
Equipment had fallen into disrepair, and one piece was so filthy that the odor 
alerted investigators. There were cases in which drugs were left unattended, 
patient records were misfiled and inexperienced nursing students were called 
upon to care for acutely ill patients, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Neither officials at King nor at the county Department of Health Services were 
available for comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted by a January report commissioned by the federal 
government that analyzed death rates of elderly Medicare patients and ranked 
King among the bottom 50 of 5,577 hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Hawkes, head of licensing and certification for the state Department of 
Health Services, said King will be required to submit a plan detailing how it 
will correct Health and Safety Code violations. The hospital's license could be 
jeopardized otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
She said King officials will also have to answer to the federal Health Care 
Finance Administration, which has the power to force corrections or, in drastic 
cases, terminate a hospital's Medicare funding. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Summers at the Health Care Finance Administration office in San Francisco 
said he has not yet received the state's report, but that based on a briefing 
by state health officials, he believes that the findings are significant enough 
to warrant federal intervention. 
</P>
<P>
He said state inspectors found a "major breakdown" in several key areas of 
patient care. A collapse in even one of these areas can threaten a hospital's 
Medicare funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Articles 
</P>
<P>
Summers said his concerns about patient care at King were heightened recently 
by a series of articles about the medical center that were published in The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly," Summers said, "the articles were shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the articles had made "serious charges of substandard health 
care" at King, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors asked the county 
health department last week to investigate problems at King involving "poor 
administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of 
space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing 
patient load." 
</P>
<P>
However, the state report took aim at the supervisors themselves for neglecting 
King. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the amount and seriousness of the deficiencies cited in this survey, 
the governing body (the Board of Supervisors) is not effectively insuring the 
facility's compliance with licensing requirements and regulations, safety 
procedures and federal standards for hospitals," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors reported that the board failed to respond in a timely manner to 
correspondence from county health officials that included issues of quality 
assurance at the medical center. The board was also faulted for not reviewing 
hospital staff appointments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patient Care 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, the supervisors were not told of evaluations of patient care at 
the hospital and did not hold the medical staff accountable for the quality of 
that care, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
"The minutes of the governing body which did allude to the facility by name 
contained terse statements dealing only with fiscal, financial or capital 
expenditure issues," the investigators noted in their report. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted many other problems at King which, in some cases, have 
already been cited in prior reports or audits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the hospital's quality-assurance officials, charged with reviewing 
hospital deaths and questionable occurrences, were faulted by inspectors for 
having failed to take action on several unspecified "significant deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
As for the hospital's nursing services, a review of staffing patterns during a 
two-week period showed "a consistent shortage of registered nurses," the report 
said. Nursing attendants and students were routinely called upon to care for 
acutely ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
Of 40 cases sampled, inspectors cited 19 for nursing deficiencies. In one case, 
a patient with pneumonia was not prescribed a nursing plan of care until the 
day he died -- three days after admission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vital Information 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's busy emergency room was faulted for poor record-keeping in which 
vital information was not kept or was improperly removed. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also documented cases of apparent patient neglect in the emergency 
room, including an instance where a patient with a head and lung injury 
lingered six hours without any notation that he had received care. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of infection control, the report also found numerous problems: 
</P>
<P>
* Bedpans containing urine were found on so-called over-bed tables alongside 
food trays. 
</P>
<P>
* Infectious waste containers were overfilled and uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
* Intravenous tubes were unlabeled with the date when treatment was initiated, 
so that it was impossible to tell whether the tubes had been changed every 48 
hours, as required. 
</P>
<P>
* Tubing for connecting a patient to a ventilator was found draped over the 
patient's bed five days after it had been disconnected. A suction tube nearby 
was "completely coated with dark brown, dried sero-mucous material." 
</P>
<P>
* In two rooms housing patients suspected of having tuberculosis, the doors 
were found standing open with no requirement of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
* In the isolation room of the medical intensive-care unit, the walls stopped 
more than a foot short of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
* Sterile supplies in one room were improperly stored below the sink drain, 
some protected only with dust covers, others with a paper wrapping. The report 
noted that "any malfunction of the sewerage system could result in 
contamination of this material." 
</P>
<P>
* The "morgue refrigerated holding box" had not been cleaned and appeared to 
contain body fluid. The conditions raised the possibility of health risks for 
personnel taking samples from cadavers stored in the box, the investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the hospital's pharmaceutical practices, the report noted that 
medications were repeatedly given without evidence of proper orders. Some 
medication orders went unfilled, according to the hospital's own records, the 
report revealed. 
</P>
<P>
In repeated instances, the report said, drugs that should have been locked up 
were left out and unattended. In addition, investigators found some medications 
and equipment had expired as much as 15 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation found numerous failures to assess patients' nutritional 
requirements, as is required under the hospital's own rules. Even a woman found 
to have food poisoning upon admission for other conditions was never 
"nutritionally assessed," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart Disease 
</P>
<P>
In another case, the condition of an 88-year-old woman admitted with pneumonia, 
a urinary tract infection, heart disease and numerous other conditions worsened 
over two months to include anemia, dehydration and "severe malnutrition," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The study noted that information on some patients had been misfiled in other 
patients' records. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators found housekeeping problems, such as dirty floors, dust and 
litter in 25% of the approximately 150 rooms they visited. One piece of 
equipment was so "encrusted with filth" that the stench drew the investigators' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
In one room used for disposing of linen or trash through a chute, the 
regulators found waste paper, a towel, soiled linen and a pair of men's shorts 
filled with feces. 
</P>
<P>
Other infractions reported included problems with general safety and 
maintenance, including inappropriate storage of hazardous materials. The 
regulators found equipment installed improperly, units poorly designed and 
inadequate testing of patient-care equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Some critical-care equipment, such as heart monitors and defibrillators, had 
not been tested for approximately two years, the report stated. Five heart 
monitors in the neurosurgery intensive-care unit were labeled "DO NOT USE AFTER 
APRIL '89," the investigators found in their June inspection.

Accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido was linked to the deaths of his wife and a 
co-worker by bullets identified by a state ballistics expert. Richard Arlo 
Waller said at a preliminary hearing in Santa Rosa that bullets taken from the 
victims matched a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol owned by Salcido. The 
28-year-old winery worker is accused of killing his wife, two of his daughters, 
a fellow winery employee, his mother-in-law and two of her daughters in a 
bloody rampage on April 14. He was arrested in Mexico five days later. Three of 
Salcido's daughters were found in a remote garbage dump, with their throats 
slashed. One of the girls survived and lives with her maternal grandmother.

Anton Lubowski, the only white to hold a leadership post in the South-West 
Africa People's Organization guerrilla movement, was assassinated outside his 
suburban Windhoek home, police said. Lubowski, 37, was an unofficial spokesman 
for SWAPO, the Namibian independence movement that had waged a bush war against 
South African rule of the territory since 1966. Lubowski was also a member of 
SWAPO's election directorate, which is overseeing the movement's campaign for 
U.N.-supervised elections scheduled for early November. South Africa has agreed 
to grant independence, expected by early next year, as part of a regional peace 
accord also calling for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.

Police in Menlo Park said Sandro Loya bet 5-to-1 that he could win at "Russian 
roulette," emptied all but one chamber of a .38-caliber revolver, and pulled 
the trigger. The 20-year-old man died of a bullet to the brain. "They were bad 
odds," said Assistant Police Chief Dominick Peloso.

The Sacramento City Council voted unanimously to provide $50 million in public 
money to entice the Los Angeles Raiders to the state capital. The money would 
serve as a "franchise fee" to be paid to the Raiders, with the funds coming 
from a bond issue that would be repaid over 22 years. The Sacramento County 
Board of Supervisors, which also is involved in the public funding proposal, is 
scheduled to vote on the matter today. Raiders General Manager Al Davis has 
expressed unhappiness with the Los Angeles Coliseum and has threatened to move 
his team to another city.

Jurors in Charlotte, N.C., watched videos showing the opulent life style of PTL 
founder Jim Bakker, including a 4,000-square-foot suite in a hotel at the PTL 
ministry's Heritage USA theme park and retreat at Ft. Mill, S.C. The video tour 
was conducted by James Taggart, Bakker's former interior decorator, who was 
sentenced to 17 years in prison and fined $500,000 last week for tax evasion 
while at PTL. Taggart described gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures, antique 
beds and mirrored walls in the bedroom. Prosecutors say Bakker, who is charged 
with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, used nearly $4 million in ministry 
funds to finance a lavish life style. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter 
threatened to jail Bakker for the remainder of his trial because Bakker had 
failed to report to his probation officer for a weekly report on medication he 
is taking. Potter relented after defense lawyer Harold Bender said he -- not 
Bakker -- was responsible for violating the judge's order.

The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver was put on alert for several 
hours because Colorado officials feared that an earthen dam at the facility 
might fail, sending herbicide-contaminated water from a holding pond into 
suburban water supplies. State health officials said they were more concerned 
about the presence of the herbicide atrazine, a possible carcinogen, and 
manganese and sulfide, than about "low but measurable" radiation in the water. 
Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, is 
operated for the Department of Energy by Rockwell International Corp. DOE 
officials had expressed concern about the earthen dam when heavy rainfall 
filled the pond to 75% of capacity. The alert was canceled after an inspector 
for the state engineer's office declared the dam was sound.

Former President Ronald Reagan continued to recover well from surgery to remove 
fluid from his brain, a spokesman for Reagan said. Reagan was operated on 
Friday in Rochester, Minn., for a subdural hematoma, which apparently resulted 
from a July 4 accident in Mexico when he was thrown from a bucking horse. His 
daughter, Maureen, visited him, and Reagan, his wife, Nancy, and his daughter 
had lunch together in the former President's room at St. Marys Hospital. Reagan 
has been going through many get-well messages, including cards from Bob Hope, 
Claudette Colbert, Jimmy Stewart and Cardinal John Krol. No date for Reagan's 
release from the hospital has been set.

Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron has cautioned Israeli soldiers battling the 
Palestinian uprising against the use of excessive force, a military spokesman 
said in Jerusalem. Lt. Gen. Shomron said the army faces an exceptionally 
complex and sensitive mission in the occupied areas but that soldiers should 
exercise self-control and avoid unreasonable measures. He cited examples of the 
latter as beating prisoners in custody or interfering with ambulances 
evacuating Arab wounded. "You should avoid as much as possible hitting a man on 
his head or other sensitive body parts," he added. He said that force may be 
used to disperse violent protests and to make arrests.

CONDIT WINS RACE FOR COELHO'S HOUSE SEAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a special election that drew national attention, Democratic Assemblyman Gary 
Condit won election to Congress on Tuesday as voters in the San Joaquin Valley 
chose a successor to former Rep. Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
With 90.6% of the precincts reporting, Condit had 57.1% of the vote, while 
Republican Clare Berryhill, a farmer who has served as a legislator and as 
state director of food and agriculture, had 34.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great victory," Condit declared during an election night party at 
the Stanislaus County fairgrounds. "We thought it would be a lot closer. You 
don't see many special elections won in the primary." 
</P>
<P>
By capturing more than 50% of the vote, Condit won the election outright and 
avoided a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans tried to capitalize on scandals that have plagued the Democratic 
leadership of Congress. Majority Whip Coelho, the third-ranking Democrat, and 
House Speaker Jim Wright both resigned earlier this year amid charges of 
financial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
But Condit ran well throughout the rural Democratic district. His lead was 
bolstered by a strong absentee ballot drive that was effective in increasing 
the turnout among his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
In Merced County, with all of the precincts reporting, Condit beat Berryhill 
nearly 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates receiving only small percentages of the vote were Libertarian 
Roy Shimp and five GOP candidates: Atwater farmer Robert Weimer, Merced housing 
contractor Cliff Burris, Livermore engineer Dave Williams, Modesto businessman 
Jack McCoy and retired Air Force Maj. Chris Patterakis of Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th Congressional District, which sprawls across giant farms straddling 
Interstate 5 and blossoming towns along U.S. 99, takes in all or part of 
Stanislaus, Merced, Mariposa and Fresno counties. It includes the cities of 
Modesto and Merced and the northern portion of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill's campaign was an uphill battle from the start. To begin with, 
rank-and-file Democrats -- although tending to be more conservative than party 
members elsewhere -- outnumbered Republicans in district voter registration by 
roughly 55% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill entered the race weeks after Condit did and, as of Election Day, was 
expecting to spend $300,000, compared to his Democratic opponent's $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
Condit was also successful in persuading other Democratic politicians -- 
including two members of the Assembly -- to stay out of the race while 
Berryhill competed in a crowded Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill, 63, who served in the Cabinet of Gov. George Deukmejian for more 
than four years, had not run for election in the region since the mid-1970s, 
when he served as a state senator. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Condit, a member of the Assembly since 1982, already 
represented about half the voters who reside in the congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho resigned in June after it became known that he bought a $100,000 junk 
bond from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of a $50,000 loan he did 
not report as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
But Condit, believing that Coelho remained a popular figure in the rural 
district, used the former congressman in campaign commercials and relied on him 
for fund-raising help. 
</P>
<P>
Both Condit and Berryhill cast themselves as friends of agriculture who would 
represent the farmers' interests in Congress. But Berryhill, a lifelong fruit 
grower, charged that Condit was a career politician who knows little about 
farming. Condit fired back with commercials portraying Berryhill as a political 
quitter who left the Legislature and his cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill also accused Condit of being "under the influence" of special 
interests in Sacramento by working as a consultant for National Medical 
Enterprises, a hospital company, and accepting $76,000 in campaign 
contributions from the liquor industry.

U.S. QUARANTINES DESERT AREA TO PROTECT TORTOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Land Management announced Tuesday a temporary emergency 
quarantine of 37,700 acres in the western Mojave Desert to protect the area's 
endangered desert tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine will prohibit access without bureau permission to the 
18,000-acre Desert Tortoise Natural Area in Kern County, as well as desert and 
mountain areas north of the tortoise habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials and environmental activists have said the presence of human 
visitors has increased stress on the tortoises, whose population has declined 
because of a respiratory disease and attacks by ravens. Federal officials 
recently issued an emergency declaration temporarily designating the desert 
tortoise an endangered species while studies continue on threats to the 
reptile. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing drastic declines in desert tortoise populations in this critical 
habitat," said Gerald Hillier, the bureau's California desert district manager. 
"There are some indications that current activities within the area may be 
raising the level of stress in the tortoises, thus making them more susceptible 
to the disease." 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine will take effect Oct. 1 and last as long as a year, officials 
said. The BLM imposed the quarantine on 37,700 acres, rather than 65,000 acres 
as originally proposed by an advisory group. That way, researchers can observe 
how tortoises in areas that are off limits to humans are doing compared to 
tortoises living in areas that are not restricted.

PANEL VOTES NOT TO FUND PAYMENTS FOR INTERNEES; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SENATE UNIT WOULD MAKE JAPANESE-AMERICAN REPARATIONS AUTOMATIC BEGINNING IN 
FISCAL 1991 
</P>

<P>
In another setback for Japanese-Americans who were rounded up during World War 
II, a Senate subcommittee voted Tuesday to provide no money in the coming year 
to compensate survivors of the internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice, state and the 
judiciary proposed instead to delay funding of the reparations program until 
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, former President Ronald Reagan signed a measure authorizing the 
government to pay $20,000 in reparations to each of the estimated 60,000 
survivors of the internment. So far, however, Congress has yet to come up with 
any money for payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Called a Hoax 
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Japanese-Americans from California who traveled here to lobby 
for the funding said that the reparations program is becoming a cruel hoax. 
</P>
<P>
"This is shocking and a slap in the face to Japanese-Americans," Sox Kitashima, 
70, of San Francisco said on the Capitol steps after the vote. "Our happiness 
has turned to anger." 
</P>
<P>
But the subcommittee vote was not a total defeat for reparations proponents. 
After first rejecting any funding for the 1990 fiscal year, the appropriations 
subcommittee agreed to a plan that would guarantee $500 million in annual 
funding, beginning in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the subcommittee plan, the Japanese-American reparations would be 
converted into an entitlement program, such as Social Security or Medicare, a 
change that would assure automatic funding each year. 
</P>
<P>
If the entitlement approach is approved by the full Senate and the House, all 
of the 60,000 surviving internees would receive their reparations within three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bitter Disappointment' Cited 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) called the entitlement plan a "big carrot," 
but he said that the proposal does not make up for the "bitter disappointment" 
caused by the subcommittee vote to deny funding for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the House approved $50 million in reparations for 1990. Mineta and 
Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said that they would seek to honor that 
commitment by making sure the $50 million remains in the final appropriations 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Both houses are rushing to complete their appropriations measures by Oct. 1. A 
conference committee must reconcile differences between the Senate and House on 
funding for the reparations program. 
</P>
<P>
Senate staff aides said that the reparations program has become caught in the 
classic Washington struggle between "authorizations" and "appropriations." 
Typically, Congress passes legislation that authorizes spending large amounts 
of money, without actually providing the funds. The reparations program is an 
example, because it was passed as an authorization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Little Money 
</P>
<P>
But the appropriations committees must decide how much money actually will be 
spent. Because they rarely have enough money available to cover the authorized 
spending levels, the appropriations panels must short-change some authorized 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any choice. We didn't have enough money to cover this 
(reparations)," Dorothy Seder, a subcommittee aide, said. "We had to increase 
the funding for federal prisons by $121 million, and that ate up all of our 
allocation." 
</P>
<P>
If the reparations program becomes an entitlement, it would not be counted as 
an annual appropriation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal government's budgeting system, it would be easier to fund a 
$500-million annual entitlement than an $50-million appropriation.

INVESTIGATION OF REP. FRANK VOTED BY PANEL

The House Ethics Committee voted Tuesday to conduct a preliminary investigation 
of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who has acknowledged employing a male 
prostitute as a personal aide after initially hiring him for sex. 
</P>
<P>
Although Frank had formally sought the investigation, the committee chairman, 
Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), told reporters that the decision "was not 
based on his request" but on the panel's own initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Frank welcomed the action, saying the matter "is now before the proper forum" 
and promising to "cooperate fully with the committee as it proceeds with its 
deliberations." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the investigation was prompted by "the assertions surrounding Barney 
Frank's employment of Mr. Steve Gobie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admitted Hiring 
</P>
<P>
Frank, a leading congressional liberal and acknowledged homosexual, has 
admitted hiring Gobie, initially for sex and then from July, 1985, through 
August, 1987, as a housekeeper-driver paid from the lawmaker's own funds. 
</P>
<P>
The committee resolution said the panel was "aware of assertions relating to 
the conduct of Rep. Barney Frank in connection with his employment of a 
personal assistant." The panel "has determined that the matters merit further 
inquiry," the resolution added. 
</P>
<P>
The committee vote began the first round of the House's internal disciplinary 
process, and will determine whether a more complete investigation is necessary. 
The panel, officially the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, can issue 
subpoenas and take testimony during the preliminary stage. 
</P>
<P>
Gobie has said in interviews that he used Frank's Capitol Hill apartment to run 
a prostitution ring with the lawmaker's knowledge.

APPARENTLY RELUCTANT BUSH HAS MEETING WITH YELTSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An apparently reluctant President Bush met for 15 minutes Tuesday with Soviet 
political maverick but the critic of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was 
allowed no exposure and little chance to voice his complaints from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
"The President emphasized . . . his hope for the success of the reform movement 
in the Soviet Union," a short White House statement said after the meeting. 
Bush also said his Administration enjoys "a very positive relationship" with 
Gorbachev, according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
As for Yeltsin, the statement said only that he "evaluated the progress of 
perestroika," referring to political and economic reforms championed by 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a later meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Yeltsin said he had presented Bush with "a list of 10 issues which could be 
discussed between us which would serve to rescue perestroika." He did not 
elaborate, but the State Department said he wants U.S. investments, not grants 
of economic aid, to help perestroika reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equivocating for Days 
</P>
<P>
The White House only acceded to the Yeltsin visit at the last minute after 
equivocating for days. Leaning over so as not to embarrass Gorbachev, the White 
House staged the Bush meeting with Yeltsin in the office of Bush's national 
security adviser, Brent A. Scowcroft, rather than in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
Bush ostensibly "dropped in" on Scowcroft's talk with Yeltsin on his way to 
another appointment, an official said. Vice President Dan Quayle also "dropped 
by," further diluting the event. No news photographers were permitted to record 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Justifying White House actions, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 
Bush did not want to "provide (Yeltsin with) a platform for dissent. . . . We 
don't want to do anything to foster internal conflict that might be associated 
with this trip." 
</P>
<P>
(In another U.S.-Soviet matter, Fitzwater dismissed complaints Monday by Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that the Bush Administration is 
dragging its feet on the strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva. "The 
Shevardnadze statement is mystifying in the sense we have felt the negotiations 
were going ahead rather well," Fitzwater added.) 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 58, is the most popular and visible leader of the embryonic political 
opposition in the Soviet Parliament. A bluff, gregarious Siberian with a broad 
smile, he is commonly called a populist, although he objects to the description 
because of its demagogic connotation. 
</P>
<P>
He was dismissed as chief of the Communist Party in Moscow and ousted from the 
Politburo two years ago after outspoken public attacks on the special 
privileges accorded Kremlin leaders and more muted criticism of Gorbachev and 
his wife, Raisa. But he was elected overwhelmingly earlier this year as a 
Moscow representative to the Congress of People's Deputies in the first 
contested Soviet election in more than six decades.

TWO VIE TO REPLACE WRIGHT IN HOUSE SEAT

<P>
Voters on Tuesday chose between a television medical commentator and a former 
Senate aide vying to replace former House Speaker Jim Wright, who was toppled 
by an ethics investigation after 34 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Pete Geren, a former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, faced 
Republican Dr. Bob Lanier in the special election. The winner will serve the 
remainder of Wright's term, which expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans saw the election as a chance to capture the 12th District, a 
longtime Democratic stronghold covering most of Ft. Worth and Tarrant County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Upstream Swim' 
</P>
<P>
But Lanier, making his first run for office, acknowledged that his race was an 
"upstream swim" because the district is heavily Democratic and because Geren 
raised more money. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, 44, a pediatric allergist and immunologist, is featured on "60-Second 
Housecall," a television spot syndicated to local news broadcasts in more than 
40 television markets. 
</P>
<P>
Geren, a 37-year-old attorney, was an aide to Bentsen from 1983 to 1985. He 
lost a 1986 race in the 6th District to Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign stirred little interest. Tarrant County Election Administrator 
Robert Parten predicted that 20% to 25% of the district's 287,000 registered 
voters would vote. 
</P>
<P>
Wright resigned in June to avoid facing allegations that he repeatedly violated 
congressional ethics rules. He remains popular in the district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runoff Necessary 
</P>
<P>
An eight-candidate special election on Aug. 12 drew only a fifth of the 
district's voters. Lanier won 39% of the vote to 32% for Geren, making a runoff 
necessary because neither received a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Geren and Lanier have emphasized their endorsements and differing backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Geren was endorsed by Wright and Bentsen, and cited his experience as a 
legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier received endorsements from President Bush and former Dallas Cowboys 
coach Tom Landry. He said he was in better touch with his constituents' 
concerns than his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates oppose abortion but would not criminalize it, want better 
health care funding for the elderly and support strong measures against illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Troops in Colombia 
</P>
<P>
Geren supports sending U.S. troops to Colombia to fight drug dealers, opposes 
restrictions on owning semiautomatic weapons and signed a pledge to vote 
against any new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier said he would finance the war on drugs by selling special bonds, 
advocates limiting House members to 12 years in office and emphasizes his 
interest in social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, several cities held mayoral primaries Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Buffalo, N.Y., Mayor James Griffin faced two challengers in the Democratic 
primary, and was running unopposed on the Republican and Conservative Party 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
In New Haven, Conn., where Mayor Biagio DeLieto is retiring, state Sen. John 
Daniels ran against former city administrator John DeStefano Jr. in the 
Democratic primary. Daniels hoped to become the city's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis Mayor Don Fraser opposed six challengers in his bid for reelection, 
while in St. Paul., Minn., nine candidates were on the primary ballot to 
replace Mayor George Latimer, who is retiring. As in Minneapolis, the top two 
vote-getters were to advance to the Nov. 7 general election.

SENATE VOTES TO TIE BASE CLOSINGS TO AUDIT

<P>
Opponents of the government's plan to close some military bases got a mild 
victory Tuesday as a Senate subcommittee voted to tie the future of the 
domestic bases to a congressional audit. 
</P>
<P>
The $288.2-billion military spending bill approved by the Appropriations 
defense subcommittee contains a provision that would prevent closure unless an 
audit determines the savings to the Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of 
locking the gates. 
</P>
<P>
A similar effort died in the House in July, but the Senate measure is 
considered attractive because the General Accounting Office audit would include 
all 86 bases targeted by a government commission. The House amendment affected 
only 15 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have accused the Commission on Base Closure and Realignment of using 
faulty data in the cases of some of the bases ordered to close by Sept. 30, 
1995. They also question whether the commission considered the cost of 
environmental cleanup at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said the government would save $5.6 billion over 20 years if the 
bases are closed.

YOUNG NEARING AN EASY VICTORY IN DETROIT

<TEXT>
<P>
Coleman A. Young, the black mayor of this deeply troubled city who is seeking 
an unprecedented fifth term, was sweeping to an easy victory in Tuesday's 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
But in a surprising upset, a little-known conservative black businessman, Tom 
Barrow, was defeating John Conyers Jr., a powerful black Democratic 
congressman, for second place and the right to challenge Young in the Nov. 7 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers in the nonpartisan primary qualify for the general 
election race for mayor of the nation's sixth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
With 70% of the 921 precincts reporting, Young had 69,869 votes, or 52%, to 
31,295, or 23%, for Barrow and 23,262, or 17%, for Conyers. Ten other 
candidates split the rest of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Voter Turnout 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was the heaviest in 20 years, contributing to a slow ballot count 
Tuesday night. But exit polls conducted by at least two local television 
stations projected Young as the winner, with Conyers a distant third behind 
Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers has never lost an election in his 25 years in Detroit politics. 
</P>
<P>
Most local political observers had expected Conyers, a 13-term Democratic 
congressman from Detroit's West Side -- and a former ally of Young -- to come 
in second, setting up a bitter battle in the general election. Over the final 
weekend of the campaign, Conyers received the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, who has long feuded with Young. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers here also felt that Conyers was the only candidate with a chance 
to beat Young in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Experience 
</P>
<P>
Barrow, a conservative accountant and the nephew of the late boxer Joe Louis, 
has little political experience. Most of his support has come from black and 
white professionals, who are heavily outnumbered by the city's working class 
black voters, who routinely support Young. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers, who entered the race just before the filing deadline in July, 
apparently lacked the organization or funding to put together an effective 
campaign. Although his surprise entry into the race generated a brief period of 
excitement in the city, his subsequent stumbles on the campaign trail 
apparently cost him the support of many of the voters looking for an 
alternative to Young. 
</P>
<P>
His controversial television advertisements, which depicted a series of violent 
crimes in order to dramatize the city's problems, also may have backfired. The 
fact that Conyers has been in Washington for the past 25 years also enabled 
Young to depict Conyers as something of a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wrath of the Voters' 
</P>
<P>
In his victory speech Tuesday night, Young lashed out at Conyers, charging that 
"candidates that sought to tear this city down, to drag it into the dust, have 
felt the wrath of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the city's most competitive mayoral campaign since Young first took 
office in 1973, all of Young's challengers candidly discussed the economic 
blight and unrelenting drug-related crime that plagues Detroit. With thousands 
of abandoned buildings and crack houses dotting the city, Barrow and other 
candidates have tried to portray Young as a mayor who has sacrificed the city's 
neighborhoods for the sake of downtown office development.

Democrat Pete Geren, a former Senate aide, narrowly won a special election 
Tuesday for the seat given up by ex-House Speaker Jim Wright, toppled by an 
ethics investigation after 34 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
With all precincts reporting, Geren had 40,210 votes, or 51%, to 38,590, or 
49%, for Republican Dr. Bob Lanier, a television medical commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Geren, a 37-year-old former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, will serve the 
remainder of Wright's term, which expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans had seen the election as a chance to capture the 12th District, a 
longtime Democratic stronghold covering most of Ft. Worth and Tarrant County. 
</P>
<P>
But Lanier, in his first campaign for public office, had acknowledged that his 
race was an "upstream swim" because the district is heavily Democratic and 
because Geren raised nearly twice as much money. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, 44, a pediatric allergist and immunologist, is featured on a television 
segment syndicated to local news broadcasts in more than 40 television markets.

An American Airlines plane skidded off a runway Tuesday at O'Hare International 
Airport after its forward landing gear collapsed, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
All 110 people aboard reportedly escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Flight 1271, from Rochester, N.Y., radioed the O'Hare tower to 
report hydraulic problems and request emergency ground equipment, FAA spokesman 
Mort Edelstein said. He said emergency chutes were used to evacuate the MD-80, 
a twin-engine jetliner manufactured by McDonnell Douglas.

SEA CHASE, GUNSHOTS LEAD TO 'TEXTBOOK CASE' COCAINE BUST

Federal agents who hauled in 2,700 pounds of cocaine, 17 defendants and five 
boats described the bust Tuesday as a "textbook case" of how U.S. agencies can 
choke off the cocaine pipeline from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the freighter Nerma, allegedly used as a smuggling "mother 
ship," as well as three speedboats and a trawler used to haul the cocaine to 
land was described by agents as the largest since President Bush announced his 
battle plan against drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Videotape provided by the Coast Guard showed a chase in which the speedboats 
tried to evade a persistent, but slower Coast Guard craft, which fired 43 
warning shots near the speedboats. A fourth speedboat escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The drug organization supervising the cocaine smuggling was based in Miami and 
had been under investigation for several months, Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent Tom Cash said. More arrests were expected. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents moved in Sunday while cocaine reportedly was being unloaded from 
the Nerma in Bahamian waters. The cocaine was believed to have originated in 
Medellin, Colombia, home of the Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers, and was 
loaded onto the freighter on the island of Aruba. 
</P>
<P>
Cash said the bust "is indicative of the magnitude of the pipeline. This is a 
textbook case of what taxpayers get for their money" in drug enforcement.

AREA STUDENTS COMPARE NOTES ON DRUG SPEECH;

<P>
Moments after President Bush finished his televised speech Tuesday morning 
warning school kids of the dangers of drugs, South Gate High School junior 
Rachelle Menetazzi made it clear she wasn't moved. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't mean a thing to me," said the 16-year-old. "These people are telling 
you not to use drugs, but you don't know if they use them. You hear about these 
people telling you to say no to drugs. But so? A lot of them use drugs 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"What he (Bush) said was a true story. But it's the same old story. I've heard 
it a lot of times before." 
</P>
<P>
Menetazzi's school was one of abut 70,000 in the country that tuned into the 
speech as the President urged the nation's 47 million students to abstain from 
illegal drug use and encourage their friends to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Present 
</P>
<P>
After the address, Los Angeles psychologist Robert R. Butterworth discussed it 
with Menetazzi's social studies class, one of three South Gate classes that 
watched the speech. 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth, 42, who heads Contemporary Psychology Associates, a youth 
counseling and research organization, said he visited the school in hopes of 
further warning teen-agers away from drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of being a teen expert just sitting around behind my desk, I want to 
get out and talk with them," Butterworth explained. "I want to get them to 
really think about drugs and what harm drugs can really do. I'm not saying 'Say 
No To Drugs,' but 'Say No To Death.' " 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth said he was inspired to go to South Gate High by recent Gallup 
polls that showed a growing concern among teen-agers about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to think teens were just concerned about nuclear war," he said. "The 
polls show that drugs are now much more of a concern. Drugs are their nuclear 
war." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Prepared 
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to visit other schools, but, because many schools have just 
reopened, he was told that they were not prepared to televise the President's 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth said Bush should have delivered the speech when all of the nation's 
schools were ready to transmit it to students. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he was insensitive to the fact that Los Angeles schools reopen 
later than other schools," he said. "I called Jordan High, but they told me 
they weren't ready, because school had just started. Bush should have waited." 
</P>
<P>
South Gate holds classes year-round so the school was prepared for the address. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. Principal Howard Lappin said the school does not have problems with drug 
use or drug dealing on campus, but he acknowledged that his students were at 
risk in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem here is alcohol," he said. "But there are gang and drug 
problems. However, we try to keep that type of stuff off of campus." 
</P>
<P>
During the discussion with Butterworth, most of the South Gate students told 
him that they agreed with what the President said, but few seemed impressed 
with how he said it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Santa Claus Attitude' 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a Santa Claus attitude in the speech," said Linda Prendez, 15. "It was 
like: 'Come sit on my lap.' I think if he'd put more soul into it, it could 
have been better." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Perez, also 15, dismissed the speech as a perfunctory "Just Say No" 
address. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed like he was obligated," Perez said. "Everybody knows what the issue 
is. It was like he was speaking because it's mandatory to talk about drugs." 
</P>
<P>
However, the President's message was powerful enough to galvanize some of the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who's on drugs and I'm trying to help him get off," said 
11th-grader Jennie Duran. "I go to sleep at night wondering if he's going to be 
here tomorrow. For a while, I was getting frustrated. But now, after listening 
to (Bush), I feel encouraged. I know I'm doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the discussion, Butterworth attempted to show students the 
connection between violence in Los Angeles and violence by Colombia's drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you buy drugs," he said, "you are just as responsible as the drug dealers 
for a kid being gunned down in East L.A. or a Supreme Court justice being 
assassinated in Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Links 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students said they understood the relationship between the gangs 
and the drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't stop drug use just by fighting it here," said Michael Gadd, 15. "You 
have to go to the source. You got to go down to South America and get the 
traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Groe, 16, said the United States "should send the National Guard down 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here are going to keep using drugs and the drug runners are getting 
more powerful," he said. "We've got to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Torrez, 16, said Bush made it clear that he was serious about severing 
the drug lords' ties to U.S. drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed sincere about the war on drugs," she said. "He said they were 
building more jails and were going to hire more prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he can do something. The problem is getting worse."

BROWN BACKS SCRAPPING OF LIMITS ON LEGAL FUNDS 
</P>

State lawmakers should be free to accept unlimited money from special interests 
to help defray the cost of their legal defense in civil or criminal trials, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he supports a bill awaiting final passage that would overturn a Fair 
Political Practices Commission decision that classified donations to legal 
defense funds as campaign contributions. Under that ruling, these donations 
were capped in the same way campaign contributions are limited. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that individuals who wish to assist those of us who may be under 
siege, at an enormous cost in terms of legal fees, ought to be able to do so 
independent of any other kinds of limitations," Brown told reporters at a 
Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Without provisions that have been amended by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) into 
a bill pending on the Senate floor, the cost of civil lawsuits or criminal 
investigations could tie up campaign funds and "literally bankrupt" 
politicians, Brown said. He referred to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who 
confidants have said is spending $100,000 a month to defend himself in various 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of conducting and orchestrating your own defense and proving your 
innocence, particularly if you are an elected official, is just absolutely 
outrageous," Brown said. "If you are literally limited to your campaign account 
in order to pay that, you would end up with your house being jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, approved by voters last year, capped campaign contributions to 
candidates at $1,000 from individuals and businesses and $5,000 from political 
action committees. But Brown said those limits and all of Proposition 73, which 
he opposed, should be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Brown said he believes lawmakers should be allowed to accept 
contributions of any size as long as they are disclosed to the public. He said 
voters are capable of judging when a candidate or officeholder has been unduly 
influenced by donations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to take $3 trillion from Exxon for your campaign, I will run 
against you on that basis and defeat you, simply because nobody will ever 
believe that you are not a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon," he said.

STOLEN SCULPTURE CAPER FUELS A BATTLE OVER ART; 
</P>
<P>
MANHATTAN BEACH EMBROILED IN ANOTHER CONTROVERSY OVER CITY-SPONSORED PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not every city that boasts a civic organization called the Friends of the 
Arts. Then again, it's not every city that seems to have as many enemies of the 
arts as Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after being bolted onto a seaside bench, a city-installed artwork 
entitled "Ddumbbell"was stolen over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The cast bronze sculpture, in the shape of two slightly abstract hand weights, 
was recovered last week after the Friends of the Arts posted a "no questions 
asked" $500 reward. 
</P>
<P>
The "Ddumbbell" caper was not the first art imbroglio in the increasingly posh 
beachside community. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach drew headlines seven years ago when police officials objected 
to an abstract metal sculpture the city had placed in front of police 
headquarters. It seemed that the men in blue were averse to the piece's pastel 
color scheme and wanted it repainted, or removed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the yearlong controversy concluded, two then-City Councilmen, under 
cover of the night, spray painted the sculpture black and white in what they 
termed a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some opposition appears to be surfacing against the city's new 
public arts program, which, besides "Ddumbbell," includes the temporary 
installation of a serpent's head (some say it resembles a shower head) on a 
concrete wall near the beach and four steel posts (some say they resemble 
outdoor lighting fixtures) across town in Polliwog Park. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted by a local weekly, The Beach Reporter, several respondents 
suggested that the city could make better use of its $20,500 municipal art 
budget by cleaning the city's streets or fixing up the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
"What good is art if we have dog poop on the sidewalks?" one reader wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Scribed another: "I don't get it. . . . Why bother with ugly, pointless art? . 
. . We can go to a museum free of charge. . . . A classic pier will be in style 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
C. R. (Bob) Holmes, a 10-year City Council veteran, believes public support for 
municipal art "is pretty darn close to a 50-50 thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Probably about half the people think that -- in an affluent, financially 
secure community like this -- government expenditures at a reasonable level on 
the arts aren't inappropriate," he said. "And I'd guess that probably about 
half the people feel that government expenditures on art aren't appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Local arts activists say community concern over the theft of "Ddumbbell" has 
spotlighted the heightening interest in public art in a town where 
three-piece-suited Yuppies are rapidly replacing wet-suited surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than anxiously waiting for city government to get involved, the 
200-member Manhattan Beach Friends of the Arts, formed early this year, 
responded immediately with the $500 reward. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the reward notice was posted, activists said, dozens of calls of 
support flowed in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Occurrence 
</P>
<P>
"Something bad happened, but people in the community took it upon themselves to 
knock on doors and distribute handbills. That's something we don't see very 
often," said Robert Millar, a member of the city's Cultural Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thrilled with the community response," said Sandy Wetmore, spokeswoman 
for the Friends of the Arts. "We're finding a lot more friends than enemies. . 
. . People are interested in the arts as a quality-of-life issue in a community 
like Manhattan Beach." 
</P>
<P>
One of the callers was Chris Davis, 25, who said he had noticed one of the 
dumbbells under the stairway of an apartment building in a nearby alley. Davis, 
with a portable phone, returned to the site, keeping Wetmore apprised. 
</P>
<P>
"She was saying like if the police come by, could you tell them where it is," 
Davis, an employee of McNall Sports and Entertainment, explained later. " . . . 
The weird thing was I had (also) seen the dumbbell when it was over on the 
bench and I thought, someone left their dumbbells there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Buy Surfboard 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he will use the reward money to buy a new surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, police say, there are no known suspects in the theft. 
</P>
<P>
And reaction to "Ddumbbell" itself remains mixed. 
</P>
<P>
While some residents interviewed found the piece humorous, others complained 
that it placed more emphasis on physique than on the oceanside environment -- 
albeit at a beach where some lithe sun worshipers are known to wear swim suits 
little larger than the washing instructions on an average dress shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Even the harshest critics, however, said that "Ddumbbell" should be returned to 
its home of less than a day on The Strand at 20th Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stronger Bolts 
</P>
<P>
And Santa Monica artist Anne Preston, who designed "Ddumbbell," said she plans 
to reinstall it soon. But this time, she said, she will use stronger bolts and 
will ask Manhattan Beach officials to place a plaque nearby informing the 
public that the object, insured for $3,500, is indeed a piece of art. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have to, because it sort of looks like an abandoned object 
otherwise," Preston said. "It has a very tactile nature to it. It's instinct 
for people to want to touch it."

SUPERVISORS RETAIN MILK PANEL DESPITE CONFLICT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's obscure Milk Commission will remain in business, despite 
charges that it is a captive of the lone company it regulates, the Board of 
Supervisors decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors rejected a recommendation by the county's chief administrative 
officer to do away with the commission, whose sole mission is to oversee the 
production, distribution and sale of raw milk. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon recommended that the state, which 
regulates pasteurized milk, take over the commission's duties. He complained 
that the six-member commission relies exclusively on the lone company it 
regulates -- Stueve Brothers Farms -- for financial support and warned that 
such a cozy relationship compromises the panel. 
</P>
<P>
A Stueve Brothers spokesman said the dairy pays between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year to support the commission's activities. Most of that money goes for 
testing but there is no requirement for public disclosure of exactly how funds 
are spent, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, commission members receive $25 a meeting, paid by Stueve Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Dixon was ordered to look into the commission after a Bay Area judge, 
in an unrelated case, called the county commission a "captive" of the dairy. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also questioned whether Los Angeles County should, through a quirk in 
state law, continue to regulate a dairy that is located in San Bernardino 
County and monitor raw milk that is sold statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was created in 1968 when raw milk dairies were located in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Stueve Brothers Farms claims to be the state's largest raw milk dairy, 
producing 8,000 to 10,000 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
"There are presently no established rules or regulations governing operations 
of the commission, or the manner by which the members are to be compensated," 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Pete Schabarum argued, "To have someone insinuate that for $25 
they're in the hip pocket of the dairy is absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' vote came after a personal appeal from 71-year-old Harold 
Stueve, owner of the dairy, who warned that a state takeover of the 
commission's duties would bring an end to raw milk sales in California. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich expressed similar concerns, saying that consumers' 
"freedom of choice" was at issue. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the board deadlocked 2 to 2 on a recommendation by Dixon 
to ask the state Fair Political Practices Commission to look into Milk 
Commission Chairman Paul M. Fleiss' work as a paid consultant to an attorney 
for the raw milk producer. The matter will be decided when Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn, who has been ill, resumes his board duties. 
</P>
<P>
The board nonetheless ordered the chief administrative officer to draft 
standards for the operation of the commission.

SUPERVISORS MOVE TO GET SKID ROW'S WINE OF CHOICE OFF SHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Duke's Liquor is one of the few places on Skid Row where street people can't 
get a cheap drink. 
</P>
<P>
That's because several years ago owner Carl Johnson Jr. stopped selling pint 
bottles of cheap, fortified wines "to keep the winos away so we can get a 
better clientele." 
</P>
<P>
Taking the idea a step further, the county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday 
to ask wineries to voluntarily suspend sales of the cheap wines to liquor 
stores and markets on Skid Row, but for a different reason: to reduce 
alcohol-related social problems in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is, if we remove this product from the Skid Row area, 
there will be less public drunkenness," Ken Schonlau, executive director of the 
California Assn. of Alcoholic Recovery Homes, told the supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Trial 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman proposed the move after reading about San Francisco's 
seedy Tenderloin District, where E &amp; J Gallo Winery and Canandaigua Wines 
of New York in June voluntarily suspended sales of cheap wines on a six-month 
trial basis in response to community pressure. Community activists had appealed 
to the wineries after local merchants refused to curb sales. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallo spokesman declined comment on Los Angeles County's request. But the 
spokesman reiterated Gallo's long-standing position that alcoholics deprived of 
one way to get inebriated will find another. The huge winery agreed to suspend 
sales in the Tenderloin District "to find out if our beliefs are correct." 
</P>
<P>
Al Wright, director of Los Angeles County's office of alcohol programs, said 
the trial program under way in the Tenderloin District has had mixed results. 
He said the San Francisco neighborhood is considerably smaller than Los 
Angeles' Skid Row, making it easier for alcoholics to leave the area to buy 
cheap wine. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe people would travel a great distance to buy fortified wines," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
70-Square-Block Area 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County defines Skid Row as a 70-square-block stretch bounded by 
3rd, Spring and 9th streets and Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap, syrupy wines -- which have twice the alcohol of chablis or burgundy and 
sell for a fraction of the cost -- are the beverage of choice of curb-side 
alcoholics, according to a study by the county Department of Health Services. A 
typical 13-ounce bottle of fortified wine contains about 18% alcohol, the 
equivalent of four cocktails, and sells for about $1.30, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably will never see Night Train Express on the wine list of your 
favorite restaurant," said Bob Pratt, president of Volunteers of America, which 
runs an alcoholic treatment program on Skid Row. "The reason is that this 
product is targeted as the most effective and efficient way for an individual 
to become inebriated." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors, with a dozen bottles of the cheap wines lined up on their desks, 
acted after health officials reported surveying more than 300 alcoholics in 
treatment programs on Skid Row, touring liquor stores and markets and observing 
"drinking practices among people on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said that attacking the supply represents a departure from the county's 
previous efforts to fight alcoholism by targeting the drinker. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors also voted to form a task force of city and county officials, 
downtown business people and social service providers to study other ways to 
reduce alcoholism on Skid Row and in other problem areas, including 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among issues to be studied are requiring health warnings on bottles of 
fortified wines and placing restrictions on liquor stores and markets on the 
sale of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Wright pointed out that in Pacoima, "some local merchants have voluntarily 
decided to stop selling single cans of beer in brown paper bags. They will sell 
you a single beer, but in a plastic bag. This has a chilling effect on street 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Wine Institute in San Francisco said that cutting the 
supply is a "narrow solution to a much broader societal problem." He said the 
trade organization favors stricter enforcement of existing laws, including a 
ban on drinking in public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More 'Shortdogs' 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, owner of Duke's Liquor on San Pedro Street, said he discontinued the 
sale of "shortdogs," the pint-sized bottles of cheap wine, about three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually have gained clientele by cutting that wine," he said, pointing out 
that customers "don't see the winos sitting out in front of the store." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said he is skeptical of government efforts to restrict the sale of 
cheap wine. Referring to alcoholics, he said, "If they want it, they're going 
to get it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE TRAPS SET FOR MEXICAN FRUIT FLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County workers Tuesday rushed to set up additional traps in a 61-square-mile 
section of southeast Los Angeles County, following the discovery Monday of yet 
another agricultural pest -- three Mexican fruit flies found in a back-yard fig 
tree in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
No aerial spraying with the pesticide malathion is planned unless additional 
flies or maggot-infested fruit are found, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican fruit fly is "not quite the threat" of the notorious Mediterranean 
fruit fly because it attacks fewer fruits and vegetables, said Bill Edwards, 
the county's chief deputy agricultural commissioner. Nonetheless, it can wreak 
havoc on the state's billion-dollar avocado and citrus industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traps will be set in Lynwood and the surrounding area to deal with the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican fruit flies have been trapped six times in Los Angeles County since the 
mid '70s, with agriculture officials spending $2.7 million to eradicate a major 
infestation in an area stretching from East Los Angeles to Huntington Park in 
1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Spaugy, county agriculture commissioner, urged residents to call his 
office if they find white maggots in back-yard fruits.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BAIL DEADLINE SET IN ZUNO ARCE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have until noon today to persuade an appeals court that 
Ruben Zuno Arce, who is charged with perjury in a case related to the 1985 
murder of a U.S. drug agent, should not be released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi set bail at $200,000 for 
Zuno Arce, 59, a prominent Mexican businessman and the brother-in-law of 
Mexico's former president. 
</P>
<P>
But at the request of Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano, who called Zuno Arce 
a "profound flight risk," the judge delayed implementation of his order until 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have until then to try to persuade the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals to overturn the bail ruling. 
</P>
<P>
If not, Zuno Arce could go free. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi set Zuno Arce's bail at $200,000 plus two parcels of land owned by a 
friend and a cousin. The judge noted that Zuno Arce has complied with requests 
to be interviewed and said he was not a danger. But as a condition of bail, 
Zuno Arce must sign away his right to protest his extradition from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno Arce was indicted last week on charges of lying to a grand jury in Los 
Angeles about his relationship with three Mexican drug lords suspected in the 
February, 1985, slaying of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique 
Camarena.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHIEF NAMED FOR WATER RECLAMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has named Bahman Sheikh to head the Office of Water 
Reclamation, a new city agency approved and funded by the Los Angeles City 
Council earlier this year with a mission to find markets for millions of 
gallons of water reclaimed daily from the city's sewers. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said this week that the new office will work to "wipe out some of the 
myths (about reclaimed water) that have been obstacles" to developing markets 
for the water. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said treatment technology now makes reclaimed water safe for 
irrigation and could soon make the water drinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Sheikh, who joins the city from the engineering consulting firm of CH2M Hill, 
will receive an annual salary of more than $80,000 in his new role. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Tillman and Glendale Treatment Plants in the San Fernando Valley now 
reclaim 60 million gallons of water a day that is usable for agriculture and 
some industries. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be, very soon, up to 120 million gallons a day" of reclaimed 
water, about a fourth the city's daily water intake, predicted Ed Avila, 
president of the Board of Public Works.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 747 RETURNS SAFELY AFTER STRIKING BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 with no passengers aboard suffered major damage 
to an engine when it struck a flock of birds during takeoff from Los Angeles 
International Airport Tuesday afternoon, Federal Aviation Administration and 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries to any crew members, and the plane returned and landed 
safely at the airport. The plane, which had been bound for Japan on a ferry 
flight, took off at 1:35 p.m. and returned at 1:59 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said one runway was closed for about 10 minutes as 
maintenance workers cleared away dead birds and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with birds caused extensive damage to part of the No. 2 engine, 
which was being examined by mechanical workers.

CLOSET SUPPORT BOLSTERS ZSA ZSA IN 2ND TRIAL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, her trial for slapping a motorcycle police officer still in its 
preliminary stage, proclaimed her innocence again Tuesday and said her wardrobe 
would carry her through, even if her case is drawn out. 
</P>
<P>
"I have enough clothes (even) if this lasts a year," the Hungarian-born actress 
said shortly before returning to Beverly Hills Municipal Court for a second day 
of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerably less media attention and only a handful of fans in 
evidence Tuesday as Gabor arrived with her eighth husband, Prince Frederick von 
Anhalt, and her lawyer, William Graysen. 
</P>
<P>
While a number of spectators who attended the first day of her trial were there 
simply to catch a glimpse of someone famous, some of those who showed up 
Tuesday said they wanted to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She's Got Support' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see her get a bum rap," said Margaret Holloway, 60, of Los 
Angeles. "I thought I'd come down and see what really happened. I just want to 
show her she's got support. Everybody needs support." 
</P>
<P>
Another fan pressed a homemade card saying "I Love You Zsa Zsa" into Gabor's 
hand before she walked into the courtroom in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
And after lunch -- during which Gabor visited her dentist to have her teeth 
cleaned and elected not to order the "jailhouse chili" at a local restaurant -- 
she was greeted by a public-access cable television show host known as Mr. 
Pete, who has been selling buttons reading, "Free Zsa Zsa. Her trial is our 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, dahling, I love you," Gabor said in her trademark Hungarian accent as she 
examined one of the buttons on his jacket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restful Night 
</P>
<P>
Wearing another Donna Karan design -- this one a camel and black leopard print 
with a plunging neckline and adorned with a black silk flower off the shoulder 
-- Gabor said she had a restful night after experiencing a nightmare the night 
before her trial began. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I slept well. I didn't do anything wrong," Gabor said as she swept 
past reporters. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, she added: "Why should I be punished? I didn't do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, she said she had dreamed Sunday night that the officer she allegedly 
slapped was "beating me up." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, however, was unable to say anything specific about the charges against 
her Tuesday, because of a court-imposed gag order. 
</P>
<P>
Von Anhalt, who has been taking brief naps in court, said his wife is taking 
the case seriously, although the intense public attention "goes a little 
against our private lives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renowned for Her Temper 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, renowned for her volatile temper, is accused of hitting Officer Paul 
Kramer after he stopped her June 14 for an expired registration tag on her 
$215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible. 
</P>
<P>
The actress says Kramer manhandled her and threw her over the hood of her car 
to handcuff her. 
</P>
<P>
A police account of the incident said that while the officer was on his radio 
checking her license, Gabor suddenly drove off. Kramer gave chase, stopped her 
car a short distance away and ordered her out. Gabor complied, but slapped the 
officer in the face. 
</P>
<P>
After she was arrested, fingerprinted and released, Gabor complained that 
Kramer had brutalized her and called her a "whore." 
</P>
<P>
The charges against the former Miss Hungary include battery on a police 
officer, disobeying a police officer and driving with an expired license, all 
misdemeanors. She also is charged with having an open container of alcohol in a 
vehicle -- a flask of Jack Daniels found in her glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Professional Manner' 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox has said there is no evidence that Kramer "acted 
in anything other than a very professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
But Graysen said he intends to make Kramer's alleged history of abuse the focus 
of the trial, which is expected to last about a week after a jury is selected. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of a jury was expected to continue through Tuesday, and 
prosecutors said they anticipate giving their opening statements today. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective jurors have been asked various questions, including how they 
feel about profanity, whether they believe police have too much power and 
whether there is a potential for police to abuse that power.

MCMARTIN DEFENSE INVESTIGATOR COERCED WITNESS, JUDGE FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered by what he called "coercion of a witness," the judge in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation trial on Tuesday ordered that a defense investigator 
either tape-record future conversations with witnesses or be accompanied by a 
second investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"I do find tentatively that he violated the court's order" not to communicate 
the testimony of one witness to another potential witness, Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge William Pounders said of the investigator, Paul Barron, a former 
police officer. "I have seen what suffices to coercion of a witness." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to a conversation between Barron and a former Manhattan Beach 
resident, Bruce Keogh. Keogh and two neighbors of the Buckey family had been 
interviewed together several years ago by Manhattan Beach police about their 
observations of Ray Buckey, the principal defendant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Call 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Keogh testified outside the jury's presence, Barron telephoned him 
and asserted that two neighbors interviewed along with Keogh were now denying 
the statements attributed to them by the police. And Barron said further that 
one of them had already testified. 
</P>
<P>
It was this telephone conversation that Pounders found improper. 
</P>
<P>
Keogh is expected to testify before the jury today. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses have complained that they were intimidated, harassed or 
threatened by Barron, and are expected to testify about their conversations 
with him before Pounders makes a final determination and decides what 
penalties, if any, should be imposed on the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution -- now in its rebuttal phase -- called the mother of 
member of a girl's soccer team that Buckey helped coach eight years ago. Donna 
Ennis testified that she observed Buckey's genitals as he led pregame exercises 
wearing blue Dolphin shorts and no underwear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confronted Buckey 
</P>
<P>
Ennis said she confronted Buckey, telling him, "You have a lot of guts 
stretching out in front of the girls with no underwear." She said Buckey said 
he "never" wore underwear, a habit he testified to on the witness stand. Ennis 
also complained to the coach, the husband of former McMartin defendant Babette 
Spitler, and to the team mother. Buckey wore sweat pants thereafter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ennis added that she observed the 10- and 11-year-old girls watching Buckey 
without his underwear and giggling. She testified also that the girls ran their 
fingers through Buckey's hair and were transported in his van. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Allegations 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Gunson said outside court that the woman's testimony 
illustrates the device Buckey used to entice children, who are naturally 
curious about sex -- exposing his genitals and thereby inviting them to touch 
him. The children who have testified against Buckey, however, were preschoolers 
at the time of their alleged molestation, and there have been no allegations 
that he molested soccer team members. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy involving 11 youngsters who attended their 
family-owned Manhattan Beach nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, now in its third year and the longest, costliest criminal proceeding 
in world history, is in its final stages and on the brink of a mistrial because 
of a dwindling jury. On Monday, the last remaining alternate replaced a 
seriously ill juror.

HUMAN SEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been teaching the course on human sexuality at two medical schools for 
the past seven years. In my opinion, Dr. Neil Schram is only partly correct in 
his analysis as to the reason that primary care physicians do not inquire into 
the sexual behavior of their patients ("Physicians' Bias Thwarts AIDS 
Prevention," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 5). 
</P>
<P>
It is without question that only rarely do physicians perform adequate sexual 
histories. However, his statement that there is a "physician prejudice against 
homosexual/bisexual men and an aversion to AIDS" is not the basic reason. My 
observation with both medical students and doctors is that the entire subject 
of sexuality, be it homosexuality or heterosexuality, is too threatening for 
most people in my profession to deal with. One must be comfortable with one's 
own sexuality in order to discuss the subject with others, and this simply 
doesn't occur in the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
An essay could be written on the causes, but the practical solution to this 
dilemma is sex education beginning at a very early age in the public schools 
with a detailed course in human sexuality being a pre-med requirement.

BULGARIAN TURKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your coverage (Part I, Sept. 4) of the plight of ethnic Turks who 
are being expelled from Bulgaria. The campaign by the repressive Bulgarian 
authorities to forcefully eliminate the ethnic identity of the Turkish minority 
is an affront to humanity. The communist dictatorship of Bulgaria has found an 
easy way to expropriate its citizenry: drive them across the border and leave 
everything behind. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 300,000 ethnic Turks who have come to Turkey so far represent the 
largest political refugee population in Europe since World War II. That the 
Turkish government has closed its doors temporarily, to negotiate an orderly 
migration with the Bulgarians, is no surprise, given the limited resources of 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
We in the Western world can simply shake our heads in disbelief and go on with 
our lives. Or, we can help lessen the agony of the refugees by supporting a 
humanitarian aid campaign. Those who wish to contribute can send their checks 
or money orders to ATA-SC Refugee Fund, P.O. Box 18200, Irvine 92713.

DISTRICT ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very disturbed in reading the arguments used by opponents of district 
elections in Larry Gordon's piece on the Los Angeles Community College District 
(Metro, Aug. 31) and legislation authored by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Opponents stress that at-large elections have brought minorities to the Board 
of Trustees. As a former trustee, I want to bring some historical perspective 
to this assertion. Only one Latino served on the board before me and only one 
has succeeded me to that office in its 20 years of existence. 
</P>
<P>
I was fortunate to have been appointed to the board, rather than running in a 
special election at-large to replace a trustee who left the board. But the cost 
of campaigning district-wide would have made my election prohibitive and highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Had the LACCD instituted district elections prior to that time, the cost to the 
district for a special election would have been 1/7 of an estimated $1.8 
million and the accessibility for myself and others to seek election would have 
been enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
While the concern about parochialism would be appropriate in other districts, 
it is totally out of place in the LACCD. In fact, at-large elections lead us to 
the opposite extreme, where constituents number 1.9 million. By a reasonable 
person's judgment, 270,000 voters (1/7 of LACCD's voters) will ensure far 
greater accountability without raising the question of parochialism. 
</P>
<P>
Under district elections, the opportunity for greater representation of ethnic 
minorities is increased. To paraphrase Althea Baker's words, we should not 
limit ourselves by thinking of only "black" and "Latino" seats. Agreed. The 
issue is not strictly to provide an opportunity for blacks and Latinos to be 
elected, but more importantly, to provide and opportunity for blacks and 
Latinos in South-Central and East Los Angeles to elect someone from their 
community to represent them on the board. The choice will ultimately be theirs 
under AB 364. 
</P>
<P>
AB 364 is a good government bill. Not only will it ensure that every corner of 
the district is represented and cost savings on operating elections are 
achieved, it will guarantee access for candidates who might not otherwise be 
able to mount a successful campaign over such a large and unwielding district.

U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reports that the Bush Administration is easing its curbs on China 
(Part I, Sept. 4). Why? Not because the Chinese government has eased its curbs 
on the people of China. On the contrary, the arrests, prosecutions and death 
sentences have escalated since the massacre. Amnesty International has 
confirmed this. Yet we had been told that if stiffer sanctions were deemed 
necessary they would be imposed, depending on the actions of the Chinese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
How can our government hypocritically demand free democratic elections in 
Nicaragua and Cuba? How can we support so-called "freedom fighters" in Central 
America, yet look the other way and carry on business as usual in China? Why? I 
suspect that it is because business interests are involved in the China 
decision. It seems that economic freedom is more important than political 
freedom, not only in China but in the United States as well. 
</P>
<P>
We, who have a heritage and an obligation to defend democratic ideals and 
peaceful reform, seem to have caved in completely when forced to make a choice 
between our principles and our pocketbooks.

BUSH FOLLOWED REAGAN, BUT HIS APPROACH IS PURE EISENHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slowly the truth is beginning to dawn on Washington. People and policies are 
starting to fall into a familiar pattern. And the realization is growing that 
George Bush has not found a formula for extending the Reagan revolution. 
Instead, he has re-created the Eisenhower presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The early indicators were misleading. Where Dwight D.Eisenhower was elected in 
1952 on a "Time for a Change" slogan, ending 20 years of Democratic control of 
the White House, Bush's theme was continuity. While Eisenhower was a national 
hero, Bush seemed at first to be badly overshadowed by his predecessor and 
unlikely to command a large following of his own. 
</P>
<P>
But less than one-sixth of the way into his first term, this President has 
turned out to be as popular in his way as Eisenhower -- a comfortable figure 
that most of the voters have decided is well-meaning, well-organized and on top 
of his job. If his speeches are as forgettable as Eisenhower's, his news 
conferences are as frequent and professional. His overall approach evokes 
trust, and opponents find their disagreements on specific policies hard to 
dramatize. 
</P>
<P>
Once the parallel is acknowledged, it makes sense, for Bush was raised as an 
Eisenhower Republican. His father was one of the general's early political 
supporters and a loyal ally in the Senate. Eisenhower was the first President 
for whom George Bush voted. 
</P>
<P>
Like Eisenhower, and unlike Reagan, Bush's instinct is to seek consensus. His 
background is far more partisan than that of the general, a lifetime military 
man who did not declare a party affiliation until he was persuaded to seek the 
presidency. But if Bush cares more deeply than Eisenhower ever did about 
Republicans winning elections for other offices, he is as willing as Eisenhower 
was to do business with the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And those Democrats are 
easy to draw into the bipartisan game. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) is a protege of the late Sen. Henry 
(Scoop) Jackson, one of the key Democratic legislators of the Eisenhower era 
and a man who believed that politics should stop at the water's edge. Foley 
obviously doesn't have the control of the House that Sam Rayburn had in the 
Eisenhower era. But from Nicaragua to Lebanon to Poland to China, Foley has 
proven to be Bush's loyal partner. 
</P>
<P>
Over on the Senate side, Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) is a far cry 
from Lyndon Johnson, who held that post during most of the Eisenhower period, 
when it comes to legislative showmanship. But Mitchell, like Johnson, believes 
that his party must be "responsible" if it is to regain the voters' trust. He 
is also cognizant that his own presidential hopes, no more implausible than 
L.B.J.'s seemed 30 years ago, rest on making the Senate look more productive 
than partisan. 
</P>
<P>
What makes all of this possible is the crucial break Bush has made with the 
Reagan model. Reagan came to the presidency convinced that government was not 
the solution but the problem. For all his personal agreeableness, that 
deep-seated belief, or prejudice, put him at odds with the rest of official 
Washington, which depends on governmental activism. Bush, as successful a 
careerist in the civilian side of government as Eisenhower was in the military, 
harbors no anti-government sentiments. He enjoys government and believes in its 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than Eisenhower, Bush is ready to recognize domestic needs that 
require government action. Like him, he'd rather things were done 
inexpensively, with a minimum of federal paper work and a maximum reliance on 
the states. But he accepts that there are tasks to be done and that the federal 
government has a role to play. Once that's conceded, Congress, the bureaucracy 
and the interest groups are in a game they enjoy, knowing that all of them will 
be, to some degree, winners. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators will have bills or amendments with their names on them -- drug 
bills, day-care bills, disabled-rights bills, you name it. Old agencies like 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, which languished in the Reagan years, will get new missions. 
And new agencies, like the one bailing out the savings and loans, will come 
into being. Lobbyists will make deals with each other to carve up the expanding 
federal pie, instead of being at each others' throats as they were when Reagan 
was upsetting everyone's apple carts. 
</P>
<P>
A few cranky columnists, like this one, will fret that "divided government" is 
unhealthy and that important tasks, like reducing the deficit, are being 
postponed. But as in the Eisenhower era, most voters will see nothing dreadful 
happening to them. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the United States does not dominate the world economic and political 
stage now the way it did in the '50s. But the chaos inside the Soviet and 
Chinese superpowers provides a breathing space and people are ready to enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Even the politicians -- the Democrats on Capitol Hill and the Republicans in 
the Administration -- find the status quo easily endurable. They can muster 
limited enthusiasm for the seemingly remote prospect of ousting the other party 
from its place of power. 
</P>
<P>
It's so much easier to relax and play the familiar low-stakes game, which is 
exactly what Washington is doing.

CAN ALLIES WEATHER A STORM IN E. EUROPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is director of European studies at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The daily drama of developments within the Soviet empire has mesmerized the 
West. Solidarity rules in Warsaw, an unprecedented popular politics has emerged 
in Moscow, and there is expectation that anything is possible. Yet if the 
experiment begun by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is halted or reversed 
-- an ever-present possibility -- the resulting Western reaction could provoke 
a major crisis within the Atlantic alliance. 
</P>
<P>
It may be unseemly to dampen the hopes for major progress in East-West 
relations and in the enlargement of human freedoms. But there is sound reason 
for caution in assessing the prospects for an end to the division of Europe or 
for political liberalization from Budapest to Baku. The reason is the potential 
consequences if all turns sour. 
</P>
<P>
Detente during the 1970s provided a potent lesson about expecting too much, too 
soon. Hardly had the Nixon Administration codified superpower behavior with 
Brezhnev's Soviet Union than Moscow played a nefarious role in the 1973 Yom 
Kippur War. Renewed East-West tensions culminated in the 1979 invasion of 
Afghanistan, the U.S. effort to impose sanctions against the Soviet Union and 
the political death of the SALT II arms-control treaty. 
</P>
<P>
As American disillusionment with detente set in, however, reaction in Western 
Europe was less categorical. Thoroughly satisfied with the East-West agreements 
concluded during the early 1970s over issues like Berlin, the allies were 
reluctant to lose what had been achieved in East-West relations. The 
half-hearted European response to America's call for sanctions was evidence of 
a serious difference of viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there is also risk of disillusionment. Few observers believe that a 
Gorbachev beset by economic failure at home would embark on new foreign 
adventures or invoke the specter of traditional enemies, although this could 
happen. More likely, Moscow would put the brakes on change within the empire. 
This does not just mean that events in Poland or Hungary -- or potentially in 
East Germany, the most brittle of East European states -- could produce another 
Soviet invasion. More significant is the current challenge to Moscow's 
authority within the borders of the Soviet Union, and nowhere more striking 
than in the breathtaking efforts of the Baltic peoples to strike out for 
freedom and independence. 
</P>
<P>
All may yet be well. Gorbachev may permit more latitude for the expression of 
personal and national aspirations than virtually anyone a few months ago dared 
to hope for. Or he may set limits and make them stick. Or leaders in the Baltic 
republics, alert to risk and able to effect a controlled release of pent-up 
frustrations, may be able to stop short of provoking the brutal reaction of 
which Moscow has historically been capable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Western expectations, particularly in the United States, are rapidly 
running ahead of what the Soviet Union is likely to let happen. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the postwar period, there has been a dual Western agenda: to promote 
human freedoms and to reduce the risks of conflict and gain control over the 
engines of destruction. For some observers, especially Americans, the two goals 
are inseparable, akin to the view that only a Soviet Union that is reformed 
internally will no longer pose a threat, or that only democracies can be relied 
on not to make war on their ilk. 
</P>
<P>
As hopes rise for decisive change within the Soviet empire, there is also great 
risk that the crushing of another spring beneath Soviet tanks, as happened in 
Prague in 1968, would erode the political basis in the United States for 
prosecuting arms control or the other items on George Bush's agenda, including 
an end to the Cold War and the division of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet repression -- say, in the Baltics -- would produce disillusionment in 
Western Europe as well. Europe would be far less willing than the United 
States, with its tradition of greater Cold War hostility, to suspend efforts to 
transform security on the Continent and to demilitarize East-West relations. 
Especially in West Germany, most euphoric about the possibilities of change, it 
would be difficult to re-establish allied cohesion around a policy of 
confrontation just because U.S.-Soviet relations had again deteriorated over 
renewed Soviet brutality at home. 
</P>
<P>
The caution flags are already flying. They can be seen especially in widespread 
questioning in the United States about West Germany's reliability, its 
ambitions, and its future -- which reflect remarkably widespread failure in the 
United States to understand how deeply the Federal Republic's roots are sunk 
both in democracy and in the West. 
</P>
<P>
It will be hard enough to keep the Western allies together when times are fair; 
West Germany is not alone in yearning for the end of East-West confrontation. 
If the limits of Soviet tolerance are reached sooner rather than later, the 
United States could find itself seriously at odds with key allies in trying to 
reimpose a hard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has shown sensitivity to some of these risks. It has 
been reluctant to raise expectations about developments on either side of the 
Soviet-European frontier, and it is forcing the pace on conventional-arms talks 
in Europe, seeking agreement while the political sun shines. But the United 
States is curiously passive as tomorrow's history is being written in Central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There is a critical need now for a comprehensive Western strategy, both to set 
clear goals for changing the face of European politics and to contain the 
consequences of possible failure. Otherwise, both allied cohesion and detente 
will remain hostage to Soviet behavior in Eastern Europe and at home.

USC'S SMITH FINDS THE BOTTOM LINE ON OFFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
HE HOPES TO BLOCK OUT BAD TIMES BY STAYING ON GROUND AGAINST UTAH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you think the USC offense just had an off night against Illinois? 
</P>
<P>
That's one theory. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that the offense is having an off year. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty harsh? That theory was floated Tuesday by no less an authority than 
Coach Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a long time before our offense gets back to where we were a year 
ago," Smith said. "It may not be this year. It could be a year or two from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The big difference, of course, is at quarterback, where the Trojans have gone 
from Rodney Peete, runner-up for the Heisman Trophy last season, to Todd 
Marinovich, a redshirt freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said: "You just don't take an experienced quarterback out of your offense 
and say, 'I've got a new guy that's going to do the job.' You're just not going 
to have the same sync so you've got to find it somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is certainly looking elsewhere. Particularly at the running game. 
</P>
<P>
Since USC stumbled through the 14-13 season-opening loss to Illinois Sept. 4, 
generating just two field goals and 199 yards in total offense, Smith has 
shaken things up for Saturday night's game against Utah State at the Coliseum, 
moving Ricky Ervins in for Aaron Emanuel at tailback, Brent Parkinson for Dan 
Barnes at guard and Bill Schultz for Michael Moody at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Marcus Hopkins takes over for All-American Cleveland Colter at 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Smith reserved his harshest criticism for the line Tuesday. Even in the worst 
of times, USC has relied on its vaunted running game to keep the offense 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else the Trojans had, there was always, it seemed, Student Body Right 
and Student Body Left. Against the Fighting Illini, it was Student Body Lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Illinois beat us at the line of scrimmage," Smith said. "They beat us one on 
one. To run the football, you've got to block people. We didn't block well 
enough. We didn't sustain blocks. We didn't drive people out of there. There 
are a few times we did and the backs missed the holes. Other than (center Brad) 
Leggett, I don't think our line played well at all." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Ervins, Parkinson and Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
"You find out who wants to play and who doesn't," Smith said. "And who is going 
to actually play. Now these guys (the ones who lost their starting spots) 
played hard. They just didn't play well. Our tackle got stuffed. Our guard got 
stuffed. You can't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, a 6-foot-6, 260-pound senior, certainly didn't expect it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised us," he said. "We really wanted to have a good game so we could 
take a lot of the pressure off (the quarterback). We just never really came 
together. One guy would mess up. Then another guy would mess up. Consistently, 
someone would be messed up." 
</P>
<P>
The line not only didn't open holes, but didn't close them when the blitz was 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to expect that they're going to want to blitz a lot, especially since 
we have a young quarterback," Parkinson said. "They want to put pressure on him 
so that he'll be flustered a little bit and won't be as consistent. As an 
offensive line, we have to pick up that extra pressure and make him look good." 
</P>
<P>
Both Emanuel and Colter were expected to look good this season, Emanuel to 
finally reach the potential promised but never delivered, Colter to deliver 
again as he did a year ago when he was an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
But both made glaring errors against Illinois. Emanuel fumbled, ending a 
third-quarter drive. Colter missed a tackle on Shawn Wax on the Fighting 
Illini's first scoring play, a 53-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff 
George. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's All-Americans don't count this year," Smith said. "I think Hoppie 
(Hopkins, who scored USC's only touchdown on a blocked punt) played better than 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"Cleveland will play. We're not benching Cleveland. We're giving him every 
chance in the book to be back where he wants to be. But he had four missed 
tackles. You can't have four missed tackles at one position and play on the 
defense. If we did that, we'd have 44 missed tackles and that would be about 70 
points." 
</P>
<P>
Colter has been slow to recover from a serious knee injury that cost him the 
last four games of the 1988 season and reduced his playing time in preseason 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his timing is off and he's not quite there," Smith said. "He's worked 
hard. He's been at every practice. So his attitude is fine." 
</P>
<P>
As for Emanuel, Smith said, "He didn't play terrible. He just didn't make 
anything happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Scott Lockwood, originally ruled out for three weeks because of a 
dislocated thumb suffered in the Illinois game, could be out for the season. 
Lockwood is wearing a cast but if his condition doesn't improve over the next 
few weeks, he faces season-ending surgery. . . . Flanker Calvin Holmes will 
take Lockwood's spot on both punt returns and as a reserve tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Scott Ross, forced into a reserve role against Illinois because of a 
pulled hamstring, will be back in the starting lineup Saturday. . . . Reserve 
linebacker Al Aliipule is out for the season after having had shoulder surgery. 
. . . Quarterback Pat O'Hara, who was hospitalized with a season-ending knee 
injury suffered in a preseason scrimmage, and then went back to the hospital 
for additional surgery, is finally home and hopes to be on the sideline 
Saturday.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL GETS BASEBALL ROLLING; 
</P>
<P>
MEETING COULD LEAD TO ELECTION OF VINCENT AS COMMISSIONER TODAY

The election of Fay Vincent as baseball's eighth commissioner could come as 
early as today when the 26 owners, meeting with their respective leagues, are 
expected to consider a recommendation adopted by the executive council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member council, baseball's ruling body when the post of commissioner is 
vacant, did not reveal its recommendation. In a statement read by American 
League president Bobby Brown, the council said that in deference to the rights 
of all the owners, most of whom will not arrive until today, the council will 
not disclose its decision until the full ownership can hear it. 
</P>
<P>
However, a club owner and council member who declined to be identified said: 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the things that you have written will happen are probably going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
That means the election of Vincent, deputy commissioner under the late Bart 
Giamatti and appointed acting commissioner by the executive council Sept. 2, 
the day after Giamatti, his close friend, died. 
</P>
<P>
The only question seems to be: How long a term will Vincent be recommended for 
and ultimately elected to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The three years of an interim or commissioner pro tem? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 4 1/2 years remaining on his predecessor's term? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The full five years of a newly elected commissioner? 
</P>
<P>
On any basis, Vincent's selection requires three-fourths approval in each 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was originally scheduled for Thursday's joint ownership meeting, but a 
commissioner's office spokesman said Tuesday there it probably will be 
conducted during today's league meetings, an attempt, perhaps, to give Vincent 
full authority over the joint meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, 51, presided over the start of Tuesday's executive council meeting, 
excused himself when the recommendation on his status was discussed, then 
returned to supervise a business agenda, he said, that he and Giamatti had put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that an acting commissioner was allowed to supervise executive council 
business seemed a measure of Vincent's solid status. Asked if he could reveal 
what transpired in the business phase of the meeting, Vincent provided a hint 
as to his future when he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect there will be a time we can talk about it, but not yet." 
</P>
<P>
The executive council is composed of league presidents Brown and Bill White, 
and four owners from each league: Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers; Bill Giles of 
the Philadelphia Phillies, John McMullen of the Houston Astros, Doug Danforth 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Jim Campbell of the Detroit Tigers, Jerry Reinsdorf 
of the Chicago White Sox, Haywood Sullivan of the Boston Red Sox and George 
Argyros of the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Argyros will yield his council seat today, providing the American League 
approves his recent sale of the Mariners, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewer owner Bud Selig, who headed the search committee that 
recommended the election of Giamatti and predecessor Peter Ueberroth, also sat 
in on Tuesday's council meeting, but there does not seem to be that same search 
mandate coming from the owners. Nor are there any other known candidates at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Phillies' Giles, alluding to the collective bargaining negotiations 
that are scheduled to begin this winter: "I think it would be bad timing to 
begin a search now. I can't see going into labor negotiations with uncertainty 
as to who the commissioner is or his term of office." 
</P>
<P>
As a close friend and confidant of Giamatti, Vincent represents continuity in 
that office. He had complete knowledge of what Giamatti did and handled much of 
the negotiating that led to the settlement in the Pete Rose gambling case. 
Supporters of Vincent also point to his varied background as a lawyer and top 
executive with Columbia Pictures and Coca-Cola.

PADRES CLOSE GAP ON GIANTS; 
</P>
<P>
HURST BLANKS ASTROS, MOVING SAN DIEGO WITHIN FIVE OF FIRST 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a peculiar, if not the zaniest, moment of the Padres' wacky season 
Tuesday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 16,509 stayed in its seats long after the Padres' 9-0 rout over 
the Houston Astros was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Saving their loudest ovation of the night in the eighth inning when the 
scoreboard revealed that the Atlanta Braves had overcome a four-run deficit to 
take a 6-5 lead over the division-leading San Francisco Giants, the fans kept 
right on cheering as the Padres walked off the field, into the clubhouse and 
even into the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was simple. The huge video screen on the scoreboard immediately 
picked up the satellite feed from the Giants' game. 
</P>
<P>
You had to be there to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were cheering harder for the Braves than they had all night for the 
Padres. The fans were booing the Giants longer and louder than they had all 
night against the Astros. Even Jack Gerard, the Padre organist got into the 
act, playing music to incite the crowd every time the Braves opened a rally. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the night, with the fans -- and yes, Padre owner Joan Kroc -- 
standing and chanting, 'Let's go Braves,' it finally became official: 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 6, San Francisco 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had climbed within five games of the Giants, with six of their 
remaining 17 games still to be played against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think watching the Giants means anything," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "We still have to win. There's still a long ways to go, and we have to 
keep pecking away. It ain't going to be easy. I'll tell you that I don't even 
want to focus on the Giants." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, skip, then why are you watching the Giants' game on your TV set as you talk 
to reporters? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Tony turned it on," McKeon said, unable to contain the smile spreading 
across his face. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear which Tony he was talking about, General Manager Tony Siegle or 
outfielder Tony Gwynn. What did it matter? Each was watching the game, anyway, 
with Siegle in McKeon's office and Gwynn in the video room. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, winners of 16 of their past 19 games, raised their record to 78-67, 
the first time they've been 11 games over .500 since Aug. 24, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in their franchise history, even including 1984 when they 
ran away with the division championship, the Padres are in a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game, the Padres believed, that they had to win. It was imperative, 
they said, to knock Houston aside once and for all, giving them the confidence 
that they can beat any pitcher they face. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Jim Clancy (7-12) hardly can be considered one of the premier pitchers in 
this game, but as the Padres can tell you, and the numbers reveal, there was no 
one they feared more. 
</P>
<P>
In a classic Jekyll-and-Hyde act, Clancy was 4-0 with a 1.74 ERA against the 
Padres this season, and 3-11 with a 5.74 ERA against everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had been outscored 24-8 the four times Clancy has pitched against 
them this season, batting just .181. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had our number," Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar said, "and it 
seemed like there was nothing we could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, that all changed Tuesday afternoon when McKeon, who has stayed with 
virtual set lineups for the past two weeks, decided there would be changes. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, when your team is on a 15-3 roll, the urge is to stick with your usual 
right-handed hitting lineup, and let the outcome be dictated by the individual 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
But with each game so critical for the Padres, knowing that any loss could be 
devastating to their playoff hopes, McKeon gambled. He had to do something, he 
said, and he'd be damned if he'd just sit back watching Act V of the Clancy 
Picture Show. 
</P>
<P>
So he started Bip Roberts at third base against a right-handed pitcher for the 
first time this season, benching left-handed hitter Mike Pagliarulo. He kept 
Darrin Jackson in center field, instead of his usual place on the bench against 
right-handers. And, perhaps the biggest gamble of them all, he started catcher 
Sandy Alomar Jr. in a major league game for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been successful all of my life taking chances," McKeon said, "why stop 
now?" 
</P>
<P>
And just like everything else that's been happening these past three weeks to 
the Padres, McKeon's plan went according to design. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres unleashed 11 hits and 21 baserunners, sending Clancy to the showers 
in the fifth inning. They broke open the game in the fifth inning with three 
runs for a 5-0 lead, then added four more in the sixth, before McKeon called in 
the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar extended his hitting streak to a career-high 17 games, going two 
for four and driving in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts went three for five, reaching base four times and scoring three runs. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there was starter Bruce Hurst, who not only scored two runs, 
but pitched a two-hit shutout, the Padres' first complete game since July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad considering that there was so much concern in the clubhouse afterwards 
that Sandy Alomar was making his first start in the middle of a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
"I told you guys he'd do all right, and look what happened," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon started Alomar in the first place, he said, because Benito Santiago 
needed a rest after starting the past 15 games. Besides, Santiago had never 
gotten a hit off Clancy in his career, going zero-for-13. 
</P>
<P>
Alomarresponded with a run-scoring single in the sixth inning, and called what 
Hurst described as a brilliant game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised I started," Alomar said, "but in baseball, that's the way it 
is. You have to take chances sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
And once again for the Padres, it paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre infielder Tim Flannery on his pending retirement Sept. 29: "It's like 
what (teammate) Shawn Abner said, 'My retirement's in escrow.' The closing date 
is scheduled for Sept. 29, but who knows. I'm not retiring if those last two 
games (Sept. 29 and 30 against the Giants) mean something, that's for sure." . 
. . Flannery, on his roast last Saturday: "They didn't get me too bad. Really, 
it was just like being in the clubhouse." . . . Manager Jack McKeon appeared 
Tuesday on ESPN's "Sportslook," which was filmed Monday in Los Angeles. McKeon 
said that an interview with Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder was filmed before his 
interview, and one with Yankee Manager Bucky Dent followed his. . . . Eric 
Anthony, who attended Mt. Carmel High School in Rancho Penasquitos, has emerged 
this season as the Astros' No. 1 prospect. Leading the minor leagues in homers 
each of the first two full seasons, Anthony, 21 and drafted in the 34th round 
by Houston in 1986, was called up to the majors after just 11 games at triple-A 
Tucson this year. "He reminds me of a young Bo Jackson, only he's further 
along," Astro Coach Ed Napoleon said.

FERRY, SHAW LEAD ROME IN DEBUT

LIVORNO, Italy

<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed in sweatpants and an Il Messaggero T-shirt as he sat in the lobby of 
his team's hotel Tuesday, Danny Ferry wondered if basketball on Italy's 
Tyrrhenian Coast would be much different than it is on the Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the crowds here are worse than they are at Duke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But not as clever," he was told. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I don't understand the language yet." 
</P>
<P>
In last season's Italian League championship game, the fans in this port city 
about 10 miles south of Pisa were so riotous when Enimont Livorno lost to 
Philips Milan on a controversial call that the team has not been allowed to 
play its first three games this season at home. 
</P>
<P>
Home is the inappropriately named Sports Palace, a tired, old gymnasium that 
seats 4,000 on concrete bleachers and looks like a World War II airplane 
hangar. 
</P>
<P>
It is shared by the city's other team, Pallacanestro Livorno. That is the team 
that Il Messaggero struggled to beat, 91-90, Tuesday night in the opening game 
of the Italian Cup, a round-robin tournament involving all 32 league teams that 
runs concurrently with the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Pallacanestro, which means basketball in Italian, is the other team in every 
sense of the word. Owned by a cooperative of small businessmen, it finished so 
poorly in the standings last season that it has been relegated to the second 
division. Pallacanestro is to Enimont as the Clippers are to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the scale, if not yet the standings, Il Messaggero of Rome 
is perhaps the world's richest basketball team. Its new owner is Raul Gardini, 
the director of Gruppo Ferruzzi, an agricultural concern which did $18 billion 
in business last year and was accused of attempting to corner the U.S. market 
in soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gardini is investing in U.S. basketball players. With only two foreigners 
allowed per team, he went after two of the best available, Ferry and Brian 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferruzzi wants to be the best at whatever they do, basketball or soybeans," 
Ferry said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry, a 6-foot-10 forward who was the Clippers' first-round draft choice this 
year out of Duke, signed a one-year contract estimated at $1.8 million. Shaw, a 
6-6 guard who started last season for the Celtics as a rookie from UC Santa 
Barbara, signed a one-year contract estimated at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
After eight exhibition games, Gardini finally had a chance Tuesday night to 
discover whether his latest acquisitions would pay dividends in a game that 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
According to a local journalist sitting at courtside, the capacity crowd was 
treating the game as a metaphor for the class struggle. But, to their credit, 
the fans did not necessarily want to participate other than vocally. Besides, 
they were separated from the court by a plexiglass restraining wall. There also 
was substantial security. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was given hope when Pallacanestro went up by 10 points early in the 
second half. But then Ferry and Shaw did what they are payed to do, scoring 22 
of Il Messaggero's last 30 points. Shaw's three-point shot from 25 feet with 25 
seconds remaining was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
After missing last week's exhibition with an injured ankle, Ferry played both 
forward positions and center. He had 30 points, nine rebounds, and three 
assists. Shaw had 23 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry said that he was not surprised Pallacanestro raised the level of its game 
against Il Messaggero. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the same thing, and Brian saw the same thing last year," he said. 
"There's an aura about Duke and an aura about the Celtics. These teams will 
have our pictures on the wall all year." 
</P>
<P>
Il Messaggero's coach, Valerio Bianchini, said that he believes that his team 
eventually will contend for the championship when all of the players get to 
know each other. Only two players returned from last season's team, which 
finished in the lower half of the standings. Bianchini also is new to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we say, Rome was not made in one day," he said.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CHARGERS WAIVE COLEMAN TO RE-SIGN USHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers waived safety Leonard Coleman Tuesday to resign Darryl Usher, whom 
they selected off waivers from Cleveland last week but then cut on Saturday to 
make room for defensive end Joe Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"Usher will return kicks, cover kicks and be a backup receiver," Charger Coach 
Dan Henning said. "We took a chance on dropping him down and re-signing him 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also tried out three punters -- Rick Tuten (Florida State), Glenn 
Harper (Washington State) and Pat Thompson (Brigham Young) Tuesday. None of the 
three has regular-season NFL experience. The trio tried out for Rudy Feldman, 
director of pro personnel, and Joe Madden, special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he did not watch the punters and that the team will have tryouts 
on Tuesdays and Fridays throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tuten was cut by Washington after the Chargers traded punter Ralf Mojsiejenko 
to the Redskins for a 1990 draft choice. He was also cut from the Chargers' 
camp last season. Harper was cut by San Francisco and Thompson by Minnesota 
this season. RICK HAZELTINE

Steinlager increased its lead to 130 miles on the 11th day of the Whitbread 
Round-the-World sailing race. The New Zealand yacht, skippered by Peter Blake, 
pulled farther ahead of its nearest challenger, the Swiss boat Merit. Rothmans, 
a British boat, is in third place, about 100 miles behind Merit.

Four sports agents charged with signing former University of Florida athletes 
to secret contracts also have been accused of withholding tax returns to the 
Internal Revenue Service and failing to provide accurate information to the 
U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Agents Gerald Gratenstein, Gregory Latimer, John Kasbar and Glenn Haft are 
scheduled to go on trial Monday on charges they defrauded Florida and two 
smaller schools with secret payments to basketball player Vernon Maxwell and 
five football players who played all or part of their college careers with the 
Gators. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends those secret payments voided the athletes' amateur 
eligibility, and because the agents helped hide the payments from university 
officials, they defrauded the university of scholarship money the athletes 
never should have received.

COWBOYS' INEXPERIENCE WASN'T AIKMAN'S FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the new season is barely six weeks old, counting from the first 
exhibition games, it seems clear that as a pro quarterback, Troy Aikman is a 
rare specimen. 
</P>
<P>
In his first few appearances with the Dallas Cowboys, Aikman, the $11-million 
rookie from UCLA, has shown himself to be a new kind of big, powerful passer. 
</P>
<P>
He has been playing Fran Tarkenton's game with Terry Bradshaw's arm. 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of Famer, Tarkenton was a 1970s master of short-pass football. He seldom 
threw a bomb when the game was on the line for the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw seldom threw anything else as the winning quarterback four times on 
1970s Super Bowl teams. During a brilliant career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
Bradshaw became the National Football League's model mid-to-long-range passer. 
</P>
<P>
He had a gun, as they say, and most guys with a gun use it. Which is what makes 
Aikman different. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman doesn't roll out as consistently as Tarkenton did, but he focuses on the 
same short-zone opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
On most plays, other passers read from long to middle to short. By contrast, 
Aikman apparently reads short first. 
</P>
<P>
"I take what they give me," he always says, and, usually, most defenses feel 
compelled to give up something short while protecting their rears. 
</P>
<P>
A superb athlete who can handle himself in the rush and throw the ball 
straight, Aikman has come into the pros with an attitude that is wholly 
different from that of John Elway, say, or Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
Big plays have always been Elway's goal. Most great passers have that as a 
goal. What Aikman has demonstrated so far is that there's another way: You can 
fit in, right off, doing very little very well. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's little game was good enough to win in New Orleans Sunday -- as it was 
all last month. His problem is that he's on an inexperienced team with 
promising but inexperienced coaching. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans General Manager Jim Finks, commenting on the most widely discussed 
new quarterback in years, said after Sunday's game that worrying about Aikman 
spoiled the Saints' summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes two things -- the physical qualifications and mental toughness -- to 
play (Aikman's) position in this league," said Finks, a former NFL quarterback 
himself. "And, physically, this guy has everything you look for in a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Only time will tell if any youngster has mental toughness, but Aikman 
impressed us (Sunday). Despite the heavy rush, he never once lost his poise." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' best defensive player, free safety Dave Waymer, said after 
intercepting one of Aikman's passes in the second quarter: "I guess I'll be the 
answer in Trivial Pursuit. I'm the first guy to get the Million Dollar Man." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Waymer didn't really get him. Both of Aikman's interceptions were thrown 
on nothing-to-lose plays at the end of a 21-0 half and a 28-0 game. Luck is 
always decisive on long "Hail Mary" passes. The Rams connected, Aikman didn't. 
</P>
<P>
After the first of pro football's 16 weeks, it seems probable that the league's 
next champion will be an NFC team, thus extending a five-year tradition. 
</P>
<P>
AFC title favorites lost all four of their opening-day games to high-ranking 
NFC opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The chart: 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 17, Cincinnati 14; San Francisco 30, Indianapolis 24; Minnesota 38, 
Houston 7; Philadelphia 31, Seattle 7. 
</P>
<P>
The losers were all on the AFC's consensus preseason list of five Super Bowl 
contenders, along with Buffalo, which, on the game's last play Sunday, edged 
unimpressive Miami of the same conference, 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
The stunner was Minnesota's big game against Houston in a matchup of the clubs 
that presumably lead the two conferences in quantity of gifted players. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't flat," said Houston quarterback Warren Moon. "They just didn't give 
us any time to throw the football." 
</P>
<P>
Moon absorbed seven sacks as Minnesota led in first downs, 29-11, rushing first 
downs, 13-4, and net yards, 343-104. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota averaged 5.4 yards a snap to Houston's 1.9. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, the AFC may well win the interconference series 
again, as it does almost every year. But at the top, it's an NFC league. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bowlen, Denver Broncos owner, has concluded that it will be a better league 
when Pete Rozelle steps down as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The (NFL's) head office (in New York) needs to be overhauled and streamlined, 
and brought into the modern era," Bowlen said the other day. "They've been 
living in the Middle Ages back there. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete has tried to keep control of every department personally. That just isn't 
possible anymore. As a business operation, the league is 20 years out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen noted "the recent improvement in NFL Properties," the league's 
merchandising section, which last year came under a new overseer, owner Norman 
Braman of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Braman took over, Properties has tripled its profitability," Bowlen 
said. "What we need is a league with modern management in all departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, the head office looks like a rabbit warren. You can't run a modern 
league with one (commissioner)." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen was one of the NFL's 11 dissident owners who declined last summer to 
vote for Finks as commissioner. And because Bowlen's views are typical of the 
variety of opinions in pro ball today, Rozelle said he has hired a management 
consulting firm to develop an NFL consensus on specific changes wanted. The 
firm is Booz Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"The (consultants) will interview all 28 owners and report back with their 
suggestions," said league spokesman Joe Browne. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly six months since Rozelle announced his retirement -- 
effective with the election of his successor -- and Bowlen said the new search 
committee is still interviewing candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have a new commissioner soon after they make their three, four 
or five recommendations," the Denver owner said. "My preference is not to wait 
until after the season. After one of these Sunday games, I think we should all 
get in a room somewhere, and stay until some (candidate) gets the (19 
necessary) votes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not impressed to read that some owners want to stay with their teams 
instead of working on a new commissioner," Bowlen said, possibly referring to 
the Raiders' Al Davis, among others. "If you don't want to come to the meeting, 
send an assistant (to vote). I'll be there, and I think most of the other 
(owners) will be there."

EX-BRONCO STRONG SAFETY, HARDEN, SIGNED BY RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders' search for an experienced strong safety ended Tuesday when they 
signed Mike Harden, recently released by the Denver Broncos. To make room for 
Harden, the Raiders put Tim Brown, who had knee surgery Monday, on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Harden, 30, is a 10-year veteran who started all 16 of the Broncos' games last 
season. However, his salary, a reported $450,000, and Denver's draft of 
Arkansas safety Steve Atwater made Harden expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Harden, who has started at cornerback, strong and free safety, is the Bronco 
that Bo Jackson butted over on his way to his first pro touchdown in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders now start Zeph Lee, a converted tailback, at strong safety. Stacey 
Toran, their projected starter, was killed in a auto crash. His replacement, 
Russell Carter, who started most of last season, has a shoulder injury and will 
be gone for another month. MARK HEISLER

FISHING REPORT: ALBACORE PLENTIFUL BUT SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego sportfishing fleet is still finding scattered schools of smaller 
albacore, but the excitement generated by the arrival of the popular tuna 
earlier this summer has subsided somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Laurs of the National Marine Fisheries Service in La Jolla said such 
concentrations of small albacore are common, but that they usually are 
accompanied by fish in the 15- to 30-pound range, which is not the case now.

HUNTERS SEARCH ROCKY RIDGES NEAR TOP OF EASTERN SIERRA LOOKING FOR THE ELUSIVE 
PTARMIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TOMS PLACE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, it's ptarmigan ptime in the Eastern Sierra, so there are some things 
you need to know. Ptarmigan ptips, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
First, the p is silent, somewhat like the birds. In fact, they're so 
inaccessible, inscrutable and invisible that few Californians have seen one. 
</P>
<P>
White-tailed ptarmigans, whose feathered legs place them in the grouse family, 
were transplanted to California from Colorado 18 years ago, and last weekend 
marked the opening of the state's first legal hunt. Fifty hunters drawn from 88 
applicants are being permitted to stalk the pigeon-size creatures this season 
and, frankly, the Department of Fish and Game didn't expect many to be 
successful. The birds live in high elevations where trees don't grow and roads 
don't go -- ptarmigan pterritory. 
</P>
<P>
John Massie, the DFG's assistant coordinator of upland game, said: "I don't 
think many people realize how much of a commitment they've bitten off here. I 
would not be surprised if we had as few as a dozen birds taken. Getting the 
bird isn't going to be the challenge. Getting to the bird is . . . up there to 
10, 11 or 12 thousand feet and having time left to look for 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Rick LaBorde, lead wilderness ranger for the Mono Lake District, said: "There's 
plenty of 'em, spread over 60 miles. But you can't hunt 'em from a car." 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday morning, Massie said he hadn't heard from any hunters other than 
the two parties consisting of DFG employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two parties out there and one got skunked and the other got their limit 
(in the Tioga Pass area), so right now as far as I know hunter success is 50%," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
This small, historic settlement along U.S. 395 is at the southeast corner of 
the state's only legal hunting area in Mono and Alpine counties. From here, at 
7,000 feet, it's at least a 3,000-foot climb to where the birds are. LaBorde 
recommended gaining as much elevation as possible by driving up the Tioga or 
Sonora passes farther north before setting out on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Clait Braun, program leader for birds in the Colorado Division of Wildlife, had 
this advice: "The place to look is the snowfields. If you don't have any 
snowfields, find the last area to melt out. If you can't find where the 
snowfield was, work the rocky areas up high where there's moisture. It's got to 
be at or above tree line. Hunt in moist areas . . . any place there's a little 
trickle of water, a real rocky area with some green vegetation, and the higher 
the better. 
</P>
<P>
"The birds are clumped during the hunting season in flocks from four or five to 
15 or 20, sometimes up to 40. I would guess the east side of the ridges would 
be better than the west sides, which tend to be drier." 
</P>
<P>
Ptarmigans are non-migratory and have excellent camouflage that changes with 
the season, first to blend with rocks, then snow. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be about three-quarters gray and a quarter white," Braun 
said. "But they'll have the white wings and tail, and their underbelly will be 
completely white. By the end of September they'll be three-quarters white. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get an early snowstorm, don't pass up the snowdrifts, because these 
birds roost in 'em. A lot of people have walked right by and had 'em flush 
behind 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Brumfield of the Rock Creek Pack Station up the road from Toms Place said 
she saw some ptarmigans at 11,200 feet -- about three hours by horse or a 
four-hour hike. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot right out of the willows . . . scared the heck out of my horse," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Braun said: "When you flush them, they'll prefer to run rather than fly, 
because they don't recognize ground predators. Their biggest fear right now is 
being eaten by something that flies. But on nasty days, their whole behavior 
changes because there aren't many raptors (hunting birds) flying around. 
</P>
<P>
"The best time to hunt them -- when it's most sporting -- is a windy day with a 
little snow falling. The birds are calling. They'll flush readily. If they get 
up in the wind you can't even touch 'em, unless you're really a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
Braun said that about 1,500 hunters bag about 3,000 ptarmigans in the Rocky 
Mountains each year. Some use dogs -- if the dogs are willing. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on your dog," he said. "A dog that's in condition is all right. The 
problem with dogs at high altitude is that they'll quit early, and their feet 
get sore in the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Jean M. Auel wrote of ptarmigans in her novels on prehistoric Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Mammoth Hunters:" " . . . a pair of ptarmigan, their mottled summer 
plumage not yet fully changed to winter white." 
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 years later, Braun trapped the original 73 birds that were sent to 
California over a two-year period starting in 1972. His California counterpart 
then was Harold Harper, in charge of the state's upland game program. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, now retired in Sacramento, recalled the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Clait (Braun) was out here and said the Sierras looked pretty good for 
white-tailed ptarmigan. So I said, 'What would you want for trade?' Mountain 
quail, I think it was. 
</P>
<P>
"Catching a ptarmigan is not too much of a problem. They lasso 'em with a 
fishing rod with a noose on the end. Sometimes you can pick 'em up by hand." 
</P>
<P>
(Auel, in "The Clan of the Cave Bear:" "The low-flying, heavy birds, easily 
brought down with stones from the marksman's sling . . . ") 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a sling, Braun recommended using a 16- or 20-gauge shotgun with size 7 
1/2 or 6 low-velocity shot. 
</P>
<P>
The first shipment to California was about 30 birds. 
</P>
<P>
"We took 'em over to Bridgeport," Harper said. "To get up in those high 
mountains is quite a chore. We tried dropping 'em from our (DFG) airplane. 
We've done that with turkeys, chukars and other birds. First we tried one bird. 
It didn't work. The bird didn't open its wings. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we thought, we won't risk anymore. So we put 'em on pack mules and 
packed 'em up to the top of the mountain and turned 'em loose." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later Harper sent some young department personnel up to see how the 
ptarmigans were surviving. 
</P>
<P>
"They found 'em, by gosh," Harper said. "Found some broods. They're very 
difficult to see. You can look right in a rock pile and all you'll see is a 
little black eye. I don't know how much success they're going to have hunting 
'em, but there's a fair-size population now. 
</P>
<P>
The limit in California is two per day and per season. In Colorado it's three. 
The birds have been transplanted to high elevations in other Western states but 
are hunted heavily only in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something that's going to appeal to the average person from the 
coast," Braun said. "If you dash up to the high country, unless you're a 
fitness nut, you're going to be out of shape and that first half-mile will kill 
you . . . well, it'll make you huff and puff." 
</P>
<P>
LaBorde said that once a hunter has spent a few hours hiking into a proper 
area, he has to keep walking to find ptarmigans. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find 'em with a scope. You gotta walk and stir 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
Is all the effort worth it? 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a trophy type of situation," Braun said. "They are good 
eating. They're a dark-meat bird. Because they don't do a lot of flying, they 
aren't muscular . . . they're like the blue grouse." 
</P>
<P>
Ptarmigans feed on dwarf willow, an Alpine ground cover, which has about 
reached its limit for the population. 
</P>
<P>
Massie said: "This is real typical of wildlife in general, that it expands 
until something limits it, and the limit here appears to be its food supply. We 
need to take some birds out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Which may be easier said than done.

HURRICANE KIKO LEAVES, BUT BLUE MARLIN DIDN'T GO WITH IT

Hurricane Kiko is gone, power has been restored, the water is clear and things 
are back to normal off the southern Baja Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
And although most of the fishing has been for blue marlin, 10-year-old J. R. 
DuBroy made his visit a memorable one by hooking into one of a school of giant 
yellowfin tuna that made a brief showing off Cabo San Lucas earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
At 238 pounds, DuBroy's yellowfin -- caught on 100-pound-test line -- was one 
of the largest taken off Cabo San Lucas in years. 
</P>
<P>
"The tuna went straight down and every time I'd pull up 10 feet, he went down 
another nine," DuBroy, of La Canada, said of the hour-long battle aboard the 
Hotel Twin Dolphin's Juanita IX. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, blue marlin -- primarily in the 300-pound range -- and sailfish 
continue to delight the few anglers fishing in what is considered the resort 
city's slowest month. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a whole lot of folks fishing, but those who are here are very 
happy," Lowanda Josephson of Cabo San Lucas' Tortuga Sportfishing said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Kiko swept across the peninsula during the last weekend in August, 37 
boats fishing in a tournament off Cabo San Lucas weighed in 28 blue marlin -- 
the biggest a 441-pounder -- and released 20 others. The hurricane abruptly 
ended the tournament, however, after the first day. 
</P>
<P>
"And there are still lots of blues," said Tortuga owner Darrell Primrose, 
adding that a 600-pound blue was weighed in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north at the East Cape region, where Kiko hit the hardest, minor 
cleanup and repairs continue. But fishing has improved because of the 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
Dorado have reportedly been congregating under the floating debris washed out 
by the storm and fishermen have been catching them at 20-60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Martinez, assistant manager at Hotel SPA Buenavista, said blue marlin 
are beginning to show in the daily counts as well and said one estimated at 600 
pounds was lost after a 4 1/2-hour fight. 
</P>
<P>
Sailfish pushed north of the area by Kiko have returned and, according to 
Martinez, light-tackle fishermen are experiencing an excellent bite for the 
scrappy billfish to 70 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California marlin fishing continues at a steady pace, with about five 
fish being caught daily, according to Rosie Cadman at Avalon Sea Foods. 
</P>
<P>
Cadman, also the weighmaster at Avalon, said no fish were brought in Monday but 
sightseers were treated to an acrobatic display by a large school of stripers 
just off the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"They were jumping like mad right out front," she said. "But all the fishermen 
were on the backside (of Catalina), between here and San Clemente Island." 
</P>
<P>
A total of 190 marlin have been weighed in by Cadman so far this year, and the 
Southland's two other primary marlin clubs -- the Balboa Angling Club and San 
Diego Marlin Club -- have reported similar success. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Oceans Foundation's second annual Ocean Shootout Tournament will 
be held Oct. 3-4, with the money raised going to fund the organization's 
various projects. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing competition will be limited to 54 four-man teams, which will fish 
aboard 10 party boats reserved for the event. Top team will win a week on a 
Montana ranch -- which sets adjacent to the Madison River, famous for its trout 
fishing -- owned by Bill Poole, a pioneer of long-range sportfishing. Top 
individual wins a 14-foot aluminum boat with motor. And, for incentive 
purposes, the skipper of the top boat will win a trip to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Surface gamefish, excluding billfish and sharks, will be targeted and fishermen 
will travel as far south as San Martin Island during the competition. 
</P>
<P>
For more information call the foundation's Carl Nettleton at (619) 237-1221. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The eastern Sierra buck hunt opened Saturday and wildlife biologists say 
hunters should concentrate their efforts near running creeks, springs and ponds 
in Inyo and Mono counties buck zones. "The Sierra deer are widely scattered," 
said the DFG's Ron Thomas, who added that drought conditions over the last two 
years will be primarily responsible for a decline in hunter success. Biologists 
familiar with all three Sierra zones -- open until sundown Oct. 1 -- also said 
water will be the key to success.

NEW EFFORT TO REVIVE IRA TAX BREAKS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATS OFFER PLAN AS OPTION TO ADMINISTRATION'S CALL FOR CAPITAL GAINS CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Key Senate Democrats, in a surprise move that could pose a political challenge 
for President Bush, Tuesday proposed restoring tax breaks for all persons who 
save money in individual retirement accounts. The proposal was offered as an 
alternative to the Bush plan for cutting taxes on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
In principle, encouraging personal savings and lowering capital gains taxes 
would both tend to increase the nation's long-term economic strength and 
competitiveness by encouraging investment in future productivity. And, at least 
initially, Bush hopes that the lower capital gains taxes he wants would produce 
a surge in government revenue to help with the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats' proposal has the political advantage of reinstating a form 
of tax shelter that was enormously popular among middle-income voters before it 
was curtailed in the 1986 tax changes. As a further sweetener, the proposal 
would sanction early withdrawal of IRA funds for buying a house or paying 
college tuition -- expenses that hang heavy over the heads of many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests that a number of congressional Democratic leaders, rather 
than seeking a compromise on capital gains taxes, now may try to fight the 
President with an alternative designed to appeal to precisely the kinds of 
voters who have been the core of his political strength. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), flanked by a handful 
of Democrats on his panel, announced the plan to allow all taxpayers to receive 
at least a partial writeoff on IRA contributions and to permit early withdrawal 
of IRA funds for home buying or college. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of huge, continuing federal deficits, we cannot enact both the Bentsen 
IRA legislation and the capital gains tax cut proposed by President Bush," 
Bentsen said. "We must make a choice and . . . with the IRA we'd have the 
participation of a broad spectrum of middle America." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) told reporters that he 
fully supports Bentsen's proposal as an alternative to cutting capital gains 
taxes. The White House capital gains tax plan only provides a "large cut for a 
small group of Americans -- those at the very top of the income scale," 
Mitchell said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate and the American people now have a clear choice between competing 
plans to advance our economy." 
</P>
<P>
Under Bentsen's proposal, taxpayers who are now ineligible for a tax break on 
IRAs could claim a $1 tax deduction for each $2 saved in an IRA, up to a 
maximum contribution of $2,000. That would provide a maximum writeoff of $1,000 
for each taxpayer. Those who are currently allowed to take a full writeoff -- 
taxpayers who are not covered by a pension plan or whose income falls below 
certain limits -- would not be affected by the change. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would also allow all taxpayers with IRAs to withdraw money from their 
accounts before reaching age 59 1/2 without paying the current 10% penalty as 
long as the money was used to buy a home or to pay college education expenses 
of a family member. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's proposal represents a sharp change in position and clouds the widely 
expected prospect that Congress would approve a capital gains tax reduction 
this year. And even if Bush gets his way, the Bentsen plan at least gives 
Democrats ammunition to criticize the White House for tax giveaways to the 
wealthy, who would be the prime beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, Bentsen said that he was exploring ways to reduce capital 
gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate 
and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate proposal comes as the House Ways and Means Committee, which has been 
torn over capital gains for months, struggles this week to forge an agreement 
between its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), and a dissident faction 
that currently enjoys a slim majority on the House tax-writing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's announcement also upstaged the kickoff of a campaign by Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to promote higher U.S. savings and investment. In a 
speech Tuesday evening to the American Business Conference, a group 
representing fast-growing business firms, Brady announced that the 
Administration would like to offer new incentives for savings and work toward 
the elimination of the double taxation of corporate dividends. 
</P>
<P>
But Brady offered no specifics on what incentives the Administration might 
propose to spur savings, opening the way for the Democrats to take the lead on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"A reduction in capital gains tax rates remains our top priority," a Treasury 
spokesman said. "After we move forward on that issue, we will be looking at 
incentives for improving personal savings rate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Mistake 
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials, worried that corporate America is becoming too burdened 
with debt, said the Administration's initial goal is to win approval of a 
capital gains tax cut and then to look at possible tax changes aimed at 
discouraging a heavy reliance on borrowing. Those tax changes are aimed more at 
encouraging wealthy taxpayers and corporations to make long-run investments 
than at benefits for average taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
By reducing the current practice of taxing both individual investors and 
corporations for the same dividend payments, Brady said the Administration 
could help "end the bias of the tax system toward debt financing." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official, however, acknowledged that the budget deficit 
limits the government's ability to provide much tax relief for dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said the Administration continues to oppose proposals to limit the 
deductibility of corporate interest payments. "This would be a mistake," he 
said. "We ought not to make capital more expensive for American companies and 
hurt their ability to compete." 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury official, who spoke only on the condition that he not be 
identified, also made it clear that proposals to introduce a broad consumption 
tax and revive the investment tax credit are unlikely to go far in 
Administration circles. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's plan to revive tax breaks for IRAs caught Senate Republicans by 
surprise, but it was immediately embraced by some longtime supporters of 
savings incentives. "I'm happy to see Sen. Bentsen joining the fight for IRAs," 
said Sen. William Roth (R-Del.). Roth said he believes that expanding 
incentives for IRAs is not incompatible with reducing capital gains taxes. "I 
would hope this would be an opportunity to gain both targets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Setback 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's move appeared to be a blow to Rostenkowski, who had been seeking to 
work out a compromise with the Bush Administration on capital gains to avoid a 
defeat on the issue in the House. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rostenkowski met with top Administration officials to discuss 
modifications to his plan to allow taxes on capital gains to be adjusted for 
inflation and to add further tax breaks for assets held for long periods of 
time. He appeared to be making little headway, however, in winning over 
Republicans or dissident Democrats, who support a competing proposal to cut the 
top tax rate on capital gains by 30% for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski suffered another setback Tuesday as well, announcing that he has 
agreed to go along with efforts to repeal the controversial Section 89 of the 
1986 tax revision law, which was aimed at requiring business to provide health 
insurance benefits to all employees on an equal basis. Rostenkowski had been 
seeking to modify the law in hopes of defusing the repeal movement. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Rostenkowski said that Bentsen's plan, if approved by the Senate, 
could set the stage for competing tax packages to be presented to a 
House-Senate conference committee, but they argued that it comes too late to 
prevent some kind of capital gains cut from emerging from the Ways and Means 
Committee.

INVESTMENT PROFIT TIDE TURNS, FLOWS OUT OF U.S.

<P>
For the first time since the 1950s, foreign investors are earning more from 
their assets in the United States than Americans are receiving on their 
investments abroad, the government reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The figures for the second quarter of 1989, published by the Commerce 
Department, were taken as another indicator of the continuing erosion of the 
United States' international economic position in the face of growing 
competition from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Ben E. Laden, a Washington economist who tracks investment flows, called the 
development "a watershed." 
</P>
<P>
He said the report provides "additional evidence that our economic position is 
deteriorating. We're now showing a negative." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the nation has been able to count on the "services" component 
of its trade and balance-of-payments figures to help offset any further 
worsening of the trade deficit in manufactured goods and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The services component primarily measures the difference between what Americans 
earn on their investments overseas -- in the form of interest, dividends, 
rents, royalties and other payments -- and what foreigners earn here. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest figures -- part of a report on the current account measuring 
overall trade and investment flows -- show that the trade deficit continued to 
improve while the services component slid into a slight deficit of $176 
million, down from a $1.5 billion surplus in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The services deficit underscores another benchmark reached in 1985, when the 
United States technically became a "debtor" nation -- meaning that the value of 
foreign investment here exceeded that of Americans' purchases of assets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resources Could Be Drained 
</P>
<P>
That calculation has been questioned by some analysts because U.S. investments 
abroad, which generally are older than foreigners' investments here, are 
calculated at their original value instead of at their current value, which has 
been increased by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that the trend has been worsening. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say neither figure should cause a panic at this point. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation could become burdensome within a few years, draining 
available resources as the nation struggles to pay interest on the money it is 
borrowing from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
To rectify the situation, analysts say Americans must begin saving and 
investing more and working to improve productivity and increase production 
capacity, so the nation can export more. 
</P>
<P>
To many, that means cutting the federal budget deficit to reduce the proportion 
of available resources that goes to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit -- the broadest measure of trade and investment 
flows recorded by the government -- dipped to $126.5 billion last year after 
peaking at a record $143.7 billion in 1987. This year it is expected to edge 
down slightly further. 
</P>
<P>
For the April-June quarter, the merchandise trade deficit fell 2.3% to $27.7 
billion. It was the measure's best three-month performance in more than four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, the current account deficit for the second quarter was $30.99 
billion, a slight widening from the $30.39 billion deficit recorded for the 
previous quarter.

MOSBACHER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT U.S.-JAPAN TRADE

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher pleaded "guilty" Tuesday to Japanese 
charges that American business executives are "shortsighted" but said the 
United States and Japan "have a better chance to work out (their trade 
problems) than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
After flying here from South Korea, Mosbacher made the comments in an interview 
with NHK, the quasi-public national radio and TV network. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how, as a former businessman, he would respond to Japanese charges that 
U.S. entrepreneurs are shortsighted, Mosbacher replied: "Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, in many cases, we are shortsighted, and I think the Japanese are 
correct in pointing that out to us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how the United States was "trying to make some improvements," 
he pointed to President Bush's proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
for assets held or built up over a long term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Blame Japan 
</P>
<P>
Such a tax benefit, he said, "would make us think longer term. Business in 
America must think longer term." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the United States "must save more and reduce the cost of capital" 
to help cut the American trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mosbacher declared Monday in Seoul, South Korea, that "we have not 
seen movement (to open markets) in Japan," he told NHK on Tuesday that he did 
not blame Japan for the continuing $50-billion bilateral American trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't blame anyone," he said. "I think we are beginning to work 
together. I think Japan sees that the United States government is more together 
on (its) desire to work out the trade problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We see that Japan has more desire to work it out for their own sake, for their 
consumers and the future balance in the world. So I think we have a better 
chance to work it out than we ever had before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Co-Development 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher denied that negotiations to remove "structural impediments" to trade 
that began last week in Tokyo were aimed at forcing the Japanese to "change 
their life style" or "to interfere with Japanese internal politics." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the United States would try to catch up with Japanese technology in 
high-definition television (HDTV), which offers photograph-like reception on TV 
screens, Mosbacher said he favors Japanese-American co-development of HDTV if 
"circumstances" are "right." 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is an opportunity to work together with Japanese companies and 
with American companies and find ways to develop standards in HDTV both in the 
United States and here that make sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Hikaru Matsunaga, minister of international trade and 
industry, Mosbacher also pushed the theme of collaboration between American and 
Japanese companies "to make technology and technological development truly a 
two-way street," a U.S. official traveling with the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher and Matsunaga agreed to coordinate new U.S. export promotion and 
Japan import promotion policies and to start a new program of regular 
interchanges among technological experts. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the Commerce Department and the ministry have had no exchanges of 
working-level experts, the U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting occurred as Japan announced trade results for August that showed 
that its imports from the United States rose 15.1% compared to the same month a 
year ago, while Japanese exports to the American market gained 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The bilateral Japanese surplus for the month, the Ministry of Finance said, 
amounted to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Globally, Japan's surplus in August totaled $3.4 billion on a customs clearance 
basis, a 31% decline from the same month last year, the ministry added.

CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WIDENSIN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>

<P>
The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. trade widened to $30.99 billion 
from April through June as the country suffered its first shortfall in the 
category covering overseas investment earnings in three decades, the government 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the current account deficit rose by 2 percent over 
the January-March imbalance of $30.39 billion. It marked the second consecutive 
quarterly setback and provided fresh evidence, economists said, of how 
entrenched America's trade problems are. 
</P>
<P>
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most 
important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit in merchandise trade actually narrowed during the spring, falling 
by 2.3 percent to $27.7 billion, the smallest imbalance in merchandise trade in 
more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
However, this improvement was offset by the first deficit in the services 
category since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
That category, which primarily reflects investment earnings between countries, 
registered a deficit of $176 million in the second quarter, compared with a 
surplus of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts called the services deficit an ominous sign as foreigners begin to 
earn more and more on their U.S. investments, making it even more difficult for 
the country to close its trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
"The negative services payment is a distressing omen. We are now paying more to 
foreigners on their U.S. investments than we are earning on our assets in 
foreign countries and that is worrisome," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for 
the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
While the spring services deficit was small and could well be revised away in 
coming reports, analysts said the trend is clear: The United States will be 
forced to transfer more and more wealth overseas to service the growing level 
of foreign holdings in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, an economic consulting 
company, said he expected the services trade category would be in deficit 
throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the United States is the world's 
largest debtor country. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, that means foreigners own more in U.S. assets than Americans own 
overseas. America's net debtor position stood at $532.5 billion at the end of 
last year and is expected to worsen by another $120 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists predict that U.S. living standards will begin declining because 
financing the growing foreign debt burden will make less funds available in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a half-trillion dollars in debt to the rest of the world and debtors 
must eventually pay the piper," Hagens said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of the current 
account deficit, U.S. foreign aid payments and pensions to Americans living 
overseas, fell by 11.4 percent to $3.1 billion in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit reflects the sum of the deficits in services, 
merchandise trade and so-called unilateral transfers. 
</P>

KENMORE TO MAKE ROOM FOR BRANDS X, Y AND Z 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sears customers accustomed to seeing the retailer's own Kenmore and LXI brands 
in the appliance and electronics department are in for a change. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 28 of the big Chicago-based company's Southern California stores 
will introduce Brand Central, a "superstore within a store" offering an array 
of more than 70 nationally known brands including Sony, Amana, General 
Electric, Whirlpool, Toshiba, Zenith and Hitachi. 
</P>
<P>
The shift is part of Sears' push to win more customers and compete with rivals 
such as Montgomery Ward and Circuit City. With Thursday's opening of 136 Brand 
Centrals, Sears will be more than halfway through a national rollout. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing a sweeping strategy change last October, Sears has met with 
mixed results as it has begun offering more national brands and moving away 
from frequent sales and toward lower regular prices.

TANDON HIRES BEAR STEARNS TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp., a once-thriving computer equipment company that has struggled 
since 1985, said Tuesday that it hired investment banker Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. to help it explore its financial options. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon's executive vice president and corporate secretary, Ranjit Sitlani, 
declined to say what alternatives the company was considering. Such options 
often include spinoffs and leveraged buyouts and other types of acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns plans to present Tandon with a "menu" of options by late October 
and to complete any resulting transactions by the end of the year, said Michael 
E. Tennenbaum, the firm's vice chairman of investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed Tuesday at 75 cents a share in the over-the-counter 
market, down 6.25 cents. The stock has fallen from a peak of $34.25 per share 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon has tried to reposition itself as a maker of personal computers, 
primarily sold in Europe, since competition and a slumping market for its disk 
drives led to losses totaling $198 million in 1985 and 1986. The company hired 
a number of industry veterans to help its PC efforts, but most have since left 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon completed the $49-million sale of its hard disk-drive business to 
Western Digital Corp. of Irvine in March, 1988. This year, Tandon reduced its 
U.S. work force by 35%, or 240 people, through a combination of layoffs and 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
The company lost $20 million on sales of $309 million last year, and lost $12 
million on sales of $190 million in the first half of this year.

PEOPLE: COX WILL LEAVE SEC; BREEDEN TO GET POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Securities and Exchange Commission member Charles C. Cox said Tuesday that he 
would leave the federal regulatory agency at the end of this month to join a 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, an SEC commissioner since 1983 and a former chief economist of the agency, 
said in a brief letter to President Bush that his resignation would take effect 
Sept. 30, unless his replacement, Richard Breeden, assumes office before that 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Cox had been expected because his term had technically 
expired, but the announcement marked the first time that Cox had disclosed a 
departure date and post-SEC plans. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, 44, is joining Lexecon Inc., a Chicago-based economic consulting concern, 
where he will be senior vice president in its Securities and Finance Group, 
responsible for directing studies in securities, securities fraud and commodity 
futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden, a Bush aide who played a leading White House role in the savings and 
loan bailout legislation, was nominated Aug. 14 to become an SEC commissioner. 
The Administration has said that once Breeden is confirmed by the Senate, Bush 
will designate him as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to begin confirmation hearings 
Thursday for Breeden. 
</P>
<P>
Current SEC Chairman David S. Ruder previously announced that he also would 
step down Sept. 30. ASSOCIATED PRESS

PANEL ALLEGES 'MASSIVE FRAUD' COMMITTED BY EX-MINISCRIBE OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<P>
The former managers of computer disk-drive maker MiniScribe Corp. allegedly 
"perpetrated a massive fraud" by masking the company's declining fortunes with 
elaborately faked financial statements, an independent panel charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, made up of newly elected directors and auditors, described unusual 
schemes to boost sales and inventory as the business fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, the company shipped bricks to distributors and marked them 
down as computer component sales. In another, repackaged scrap metal and 
obsolete parts were made to appear to be new products. 
</P>
<P>
"The fraud was all the more alarming in that it required the active 
participation of many company personnel, and was apparently common knowledge 
among a great many other employees," said the panel, which submitted its study 
of the business practices of Longmont, Colo.-based MiniScribe to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were "the company, its directors, its outside auditors and the 
investing public," the panel said. The report concluded that MiniScribe's 
operating results were manipulated to boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement accompanying the report, the company's new management said 
previously reported earnings for 1986 through 1988 will be "materially and 
adversely affected" when accurate results are compiled. 
</P>
<P>
Former MiniScribe Chairman Q. T. Wiles resigned in February, and several top 
officials were dismissed after the company announced a fourth-quarter 1988 loss 
of $14.6 million and a drop in annual profits to $25.8 million from $31.1 
million despite what it had claimed was a 66% gain in sales to $362.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reorganized Firm 
</P>
<P>
Wiles, formerly the chairman of venture capital firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist and 
a respected corporate turnaround specialist, took command at MiniScribe in 
1985. The company had just lost its biggest customer, International Business 
Machines Corp., and the personal computer industry was weak. 
</P>
<P>
Wiles sharply reduced the work force and reorganized the company, creating 
separate divisions, each with its own incentives and sales quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"MiniScribe's management environment created and maintained an exceptional 
amount of pressure on company managers to achieve pre-established quarterly 
profitability goals," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"For division managers, the most important task was, invariably, to 'make the 
numbers,' " it said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Wiles by telephone at his home in Sherman Oaks were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The report said MiniScribe's accounting and internal auditing function was 
"organized to prevent its 'interference' with the company's business 
operations." This put its financial control function "in the operating 
divisions, where it resided in the hands of individuals who did not necessarily 
have financial training." 
</P>
<P>
The report said liberal use of incentive payments "provided, to those willing 
to engage in fraudulent activities, both the incentive and the means to do so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practices Listed 
</P>
<P>
The report described the following irregular practices: 
</P>
<P>
* Following completion of the year-end 1986 physical inventory, the company 
discovered a shortage valued at $4 million to $6 million. The shortfall was 
concealed by senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
* Company officials apparently broke into locked trunks containing the 
auditors' work papers during the 1986 year-end audit and changed inventory 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
* MiniScribe generated $3.66 million of false inventory values by packaging 
bricks and shipping them in 1987 to distributors as disk drives, posting $4.3 
million in sales. When the shipments were returned, it increased its inventory 
by the purported cost of the items shipped, or $3.66 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Obsolete parts were shipped to Singapore and Hong Kong and, with scrap and 
other parts at those locations, were repackaged or relabeled as active parts 
and then included in the 1987 inventory at a value of $8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Throughout 1988, the accumulated scrap that had been written off was included 
in inventory at full value. Obsolete parts and scrap from the 1987 inventory 
were also carried on 1988 books and valued at $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* During the 1988 fourth quarter, 6,100 disk drives were found to be 
contaminated. The drives were counted during the physical inventory and 
included in inventory at full value. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that in 1988, the company dramatically increased shipments 
to three warehouses, booking $56.4 million in sales and a gross profit of $5.4 
million. According to the investigators, none of these sales should have been 
reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Financial Officer Roger J. Mason said MiniScribe hopes to complete a 
restatement of financial results for 1986, 1987 and 1988 within six to eight 
weeks. A July 2, 1989, balance sheet also is being worked on and is expected to 
show a very substantial negative net worth.

CONGRESS WIDENS DRUG INDUSTRY PROBE

<P>
The chairman of a congressional committee that has been investigating 
corruption and fraud in the generic drug industry for the past year said 
Tuesday that the probe was expanding to the makers of brand-name products. 
</P>
<P>
The first target of the expanded inquiry is to be Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of 
Indianapolis, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell 
(D-Mich.) disclosed in a letter to Food and Drug Administration Chief Frank E. 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was made public late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's letter was prompted by Lilly's announcement earlier Tuesday that the 
drug maker had begun a voluntary recall from its wholesalers of 18 lots of 
drugs involving 10 different products. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly said it initiated the recall because some of the manufacturing procedures 
used for the drugs had not been approved in advance by the Food and Drug 
Administration, as required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, in his letter to Young, asked for copies of the FDA's internal reports 
on a just-concluded agency inspection of Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection's findings had led to the recall, Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources confirmed that the letter was a sign of Dingell's intent 
to expand the investigation, saying the lawmaker wanted to look at Lilly to 
determine whether that company's problems were unique or indicative of a 
broader pattern in the manufacture of brand-name drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell has spearheaded a yearlong probe of the generic drug industry that, in 
conjunction with federal prosecutors in Baltimore, has turned up drug company 
payoffs to FDA drug reviewers, manufacturing irregularities, paper work 
deficiencies and testing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has also led to the recall of numerous drug products, though 
there have been no reports of safety problems attributed to the irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, a senior FDA enforcement official told a hearing of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee's Investigations Subcommittee that recent special 
inspections had turned up manufacturing and paper work irregularities in 11 of 
13 generic drug makers that were targeted for review because they were 
suspected of compliance problems.

HEARINGS ON CREDIT PRIVACY BEGIN TODAY

For years, Orange-based TRW Credit Data and a handful of other credit reporting 
giants have earned a good living generating detailed reports on the ability of 
millions of Americans to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, the credit companies and their parent firms have found 
a new way to turn a profit by selling sophisticated mailing lists and related 
services drawing, in part, on credit information stored in their massive data 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an innovation that pleases everyone. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional subcommittee, in a hearing today, will be examining the 
19-year-old federal credit privacy law and the degree to which TRW and its 
competitors keep faith with both its letter and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'War Already Lost' 
</P>
<P>
"Credit information is being used for secondary purposes -- purposes different 
from the one for which the information was gathered," said Robert Ellis Smith, 
publisher of the Washington-based Privacy Journal, which covers the credit 
reporting industry. "This violates the intent of the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act." 
</P>
<P>
Selling credit data for use in direct-mail marketing efforts "is a privacy 
intrusion," said Janlori Goldman, Washington staff attorney for the American 
Civil Liberties Union. "That is where we think the act needs to be 
strengthened." 
</P>
<P>
"The war (for) privacy has already been lost," added Steve Hamm, past president 
of the National Assn. of Consumer Agency Administrators and administrator of 
the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer affairs subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee is particularly interested in the issue of using credit 
information to generate mailing lists and consumer profiles, one staff member 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act, has found no grounds to halt the practice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Discussed Directly' 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that is not discussed directly in the act at all," said the 
staff member, who asked not to be named. "I think it's a growing concern of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Along with TRW, other major credit reporting services that sell information to 
be used in direct-mail solicitations are Equifax Inc. of Atlanta and Trans 
Union Corp. of Chicago. Together, the firms maintain some 400 million credit 
files on about 180 million Americans. All three will be represented at the 
congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for TRW said the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to 
protect the privacy of the 150 million or so Americans on which it maintains 
credit files. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are absolutely the industry leader . . . in protecting privacy," 
Michael M. Van Buskirk, vice president of TRW Information Systems Group, said 
in a telephone interview from his Orange County office.

The suit, which seeks more than $60 million in damages, contends that in 
arranging financing for the purchase and, later, the sale of McCall Pattern, 
Lewis saddled the company with so much debt that McCall Pattern was forced to 
file for reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in December, the same month that McCall Pattern sought bankruptcy 
protection, Lewis bought Beatrice International Foods Co. for $985 million, 
making it by far the largest black-owned business in the country. Lewis is 
chairman of the firm.

<P>
R. S. (Butch) Meily, a spokesman in Lewis' Paris office, called Crowthers' 
32-page lawsuit "totally without merit." He pointed out that Lewis would hardly 
want to bankrupt a company in which he still owns a 20% share. 
</P>
<P>
McCall Pattern officials declined to comment and referred questions to the 
company's lawyer, Robert W. Gottlieb, who said the suit was a "legitimate 
complaint. Many of these LBOs lack financial stability." 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits brought by buyers against sellers of highly leveraged companies may 
become more widespread in the wake of the wave of LBOs sweeping the nation, say 
some lawyers, who believe that owners may feel that they have little to lose by 
risking a relatively small amount in legal fees when they already owe creditors 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's increasing with all these leveraged buyouts," said Ronald J. Gilsen, a 
law professor at Stanford University. Disappointed buyers often decide that 
they would like to have paid less for a company than they did, he said. 
"There's always a 50-50 chance" that a judge will agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Net Worth Dips 
</P>
<P>
Filed in U.S. District Court in New York, the lawsuit also names investors 
Shearson Lehman Bros. Group and Bankers Trust Co. as well as nine other 
shareholders and directors of Lewis' holding company, TLC Group. 
</P>
<P>
TLC Group had bought McCall Pattern for $24.5 million in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, an investor group controlled by John Crowther PLC, a British 
textile concern, paid TLC $63 million for McCall Pattern. Shearson, TLC, a 
subsidiary of Shearson Group, and Bankers Trust provided a combined $35 million 
in short-term loans to Crowther to purchase the McCall stock, according to the 
lawsuit. The $35-million, 9.75% note issue was sold to Travelers Insurance Co. 
and Travelers Indemnity Co. in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Crowthers McCall's net worth dipped below the minimum required 
under the note agreement with Travelers, and the notes were declared in 
default.

JAZZ NOTES : AN ENCYCLOPEDIC REVIEW OF THE IDIOM; BRUNCH TO AID BLACK MUSIC 
FOUNDATION 
</P>

Whether you're new to jazz and want some insight into its history and major 
(and minor) players, or a seasoned fan looking for a nostalgic stroll down the 
music's memory lane, you'll find the September issue of down beat, which 
celebrates that magazine's 55th year of continual publication, of more than 
passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
The 104-page issue, on the newsstands now, is a mini-encyclopedia, replete with 
reprinted stories (some in the original typeface, some reset), pictures (of 
artists and the magazine's original covers) and reviews. It also includes 
chronological compendiums of hundreds of facts for each decade from the '30s 
through the '80s. "We wanted to bring things up to date, let people know where 
we've been, where we're going," said editor John Ephland. "We felt the end of 
the '80s was a good time to take a pause and reflect." 
</P>
<P>
Since down beat began pretty much as a pop music fanzine, the early years find 
issues with corny covers and blaring headlines like " 'W.C. Handy Is a Liar!' 
says Jelly Roll (Morton)" or "Clothes Torn Off Girl Vocalist." But by the 
mid-'50s, the publication's subject matter had taken a much more serious, 
scholarly tone, represented by, say, a mid-'50s profile on Miles Davis written 
by Hentoff or a mid-'80s Q&amp;A piece with Wynton and Branford Marsalis, 
written by Times contributor A. James Liska. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not without its drawbacks. Articles are truncated and stop 
seemingly in mid-sentence, some of the most biting criticism is offered without 
bylines, and the page layouts often make it hard to separate editorial copy 
from advertising. Still, for a brief yet broad look into jazz's past and 
present, the issue is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Reliving the glory years of the Central Avenue musical scene will be one of the 
themes of "Jazz &amp; Pizazz," a jazz brunch and fashion show benefiting the 
nonprofit BEEM foundation. The event, which will begin at noon Sunday at the 
Doubletree Hotel in Marina del Rey, features reedman Buddy Collette's quintet, 
singer O.C. Smith, violinist Ginger Smock and fashions by Leslie Thames. 
</P>
<P>
BEEM -- Black Experience as Expressed Through Music -- was founded in 1982 "to 
promote appreciation of the contributions made by black composers and 
performers to the world of music," said Bette Y. Cox, the organization's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 285-3366. 
</P>
<P>
Red Holloway doesn't spend much time at home these days. 
</P>
<P>
The bluesy saxman -- who resided in the Los Angeles area for two decades before 
moving to Cambria, Calif., in 1987 -- has the kind of work schedule that many 
musicians only dream of. Since May, Holloway -- who plays with Ray Brown and 
Friends at the Loa in Santa Monica Friday and Saturday -- has been to Europe 
three times and is set to go to Australia in a week, after he takes part in a 
jazz cruise from Vancouver, Canada, to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Long as they keep paying, I'm ready to go," said Holloway, whose latest LP is 
"Locksmith Blues" (Concord). "It helps take care of some of my bills and lets 
me live in the manner to which I'm not accustomed." 
</P>
<P>
While in Los Angeles a few weeks ago for a two-night engagement with Jack 
Sheldon at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, Holloway got a call to do 
part of the sound track for David Lynch's latest film, "Wild at Heart," which 
is filming in locations around town. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Roswell, the music supervisor, had heard me play at the (now-defunct) 
Parisian Room (a Los Angles club where Holloway was musical director from 
1967-82) and wanted to use me," Holloway said. "So pianist Dave MacKay, bassist 
Kenny Wild and drummer Joe Porcaro played a tune of Kenny's, a blues with a 
bridge, that's used behind a striptease dancer at a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
The tune, "Blues Cake Jazz Icing," was changed slightly by the saxman. "(Music 
coordinator) Cheryl Churchill asked me if I could come up with a different 
beginning, I said, 'Yeah,' and when I played it, she said, 'That was exactly 
what I wanted,' " Holloway said. Wild will still receive full writer's credit, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything left unfulfilled for Holloway, who has toured with greats 
like George Benson, Sonny Stitt and Clark Terry, it's a trip to Japan. "That 
would really put the icing on the cake," he said, pun intended.

TORONTO FESTIVAL: THE CIVILIZED ALTERNATIVE TO CANNES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

TORONTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here during the 14th running of the Festival of Festivals, the odds in favor of 
the dedicated moviegoer have been nothing less than startling. It's enough to 
make one superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
"In Country," the gala festival opener directed by Toronto's own Norman 
Jewison, was what Canadian festival programmers dream about: a warmly received, 
moving film headed for widespread exposure and made by a Canadian director. 
</P>
<P>
So far, on a daily average since opening night, if you picked your way 
carefully, it's been possible to see four exceptional movies out of four, or 
five out of five each day. Those odds seem pretty formidable, considering the 
range of nationalities in this best-of-the-best list: France, Australia, 
Taiwan, the United States, Italy, Poland and Canada; features and 
documentaries; the known, the unknown and the triumphantly discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Already there's been a sleeper, "Roger and Me," a modest-looking documentary 
whose subject -- the death of the one-industry town of Flint, Mich., after 
General Motors closed three plants and laid off 30,000 workers -- is 
far-reaching and tragic, but with a touch so warm, so piercingly hilarious, 
that film maker Michael Moore is finding himself the object of hot pursuit from 
every small distribution company here. 
</P>
<P>
It's like the documentary version of the rush that "sex, lies, and videotape's" 
Steven Soderbergh got at the U.S. Festival in Park City, Utah, and the 
genuinely modest Moore, a former political magazine editor whose persona is 
rather like that of a more political Garrison Keillor, seems understandably 
stunned. Not even his reception at the Telluride Festival the weekend before, 
where they had to tack on three additional screenings for the overflow crowds, 
quite prepared the first-time film maker for this. 
</P>
<P>
"In Country," which opens in Los Angeles on Friday, seemed to set the tone of 
profound audience reaction: Its closing moments at the black-marble Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial reduced the majority of the opening nighters to 
uncontrollable tears. Director Jewison likes to call it a healing film, and it 
may be just that. It's the story of a spirited 17-year-old Kentucky girl who, 
in 1989, tries to understand something about her young father who died in 
Vietnam before she was born and about the war that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
Centering on one splintered family and tenderly adapted from Bobbie Ann Mason's 
semi-autobiographical novel, "In Country" is all the more interesting for its 
seeming randomness and loose-limbed structure. And although the strong presence 
and solid performance by Bruce Willis as the girl's Vietnam War vet uncle will 
probably be the film's commercial magnet, it's British actress Emily Lloyd's 
shadings and insights as the mercurial Sam that audiences are likely to come 
away talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy drama is not the only thing scoring with Toronto audiences. "The Icicle 
Thief," a convulsively funny satire that manages to savage contemporary TV and 
Italian neo-realism with equal invention, is another of the early hits. 
Maurizio Nichetti, the author, director and star who plays both an earnest, 
mustachioed director and his own central character, is a real find, with a 
comic identity as ingratiating as any of Jacques Tati's memorable bumblers. 
</P>
<P>
What seems amazing to American eyes are these Toronto crowds. They're eclectic, 
they're faithful, they're informed and they are undeniably dogged. With the 
word of mouth that came with "Roger and Me," it wasn't surprising that about 
100 people were turned away from its evening screening in a small theater. 
What's amazing is to see an equally patient line stretching around a block at 
9:30 on a Saturday morning, and to learn that another hundred didn't make it 
into "The Icicle Thief" at a remote 950-seat theater away from the center hub 
of screenings. 
</P>
<P>
As one global veteran of Third World festivals commented wryly, "I never saw 
such lines, not even under socialism!" 
</P>
<P>
Subject matter doesn't daunt these crowds. Describe a film in the catalogue as 
a "quiet, gentle reflection on a strange physical and spiritual voyage through 
India," and Alain Corneau's masterly "Nocturne Indienne" starring "Betty 
Blue's" leading actor Jean-Hugues Anglade fills up before noon on a Sunday 
morning. Explain that the witty and winning documentary "The Big Bang," by 
long-absent director Jim Toback, gets its mixed bag of subjects (astronomer 
Fred Hess, basketball player Darryl Dawkins, violinist Eugene Fodor and more) 
into discussions of life, death, creation, orgasm, love and madness and you get 
a capacity audience at 9:30 on a humid Sunday morning. Amazing. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto has been sneaking up on the position it holds today. It began like many 
hopeful festivals, a slightly insular and underfunded dream in the minds of two 
men, Dusty Cohl and William Marshall. It has emerged, particularly in the last 
five years, as a premiere flagship festival: the civilized alternative to 
Cannes' hurly-burly, the place to catch up with the cream of that festival, 
with Berlin, Montreal and even the Telluride programming. Unpretentious and 
warm, its programmers and directors have forged it into a festival with an eye, 
a conscience, wit and, apparently, wherewithal. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underline that, as the new week's outpouring of films began, Ontario 
Premier David Peterson announced the merging of the 20-year-old Ontario Film 
Institute with the Festival of Festivals. What does Peterson's flowery 
bureaucratese really mean? The first steps toward creation of a cinematheque, a 
consummation devoutly to be wished . . . in any civilized film community.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER NEARLY FADING OUT, CUBS COME ON STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Friday, after wasting a 7-1 lead and losing to the St. Louis Cardinals, 
the Chicago Cubs appeared to be a team in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' lead in the National League East was only one-half game over the 
Cardinals. Their pitching appeared to be in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed a question only of which of the three teams chasing them would take 
advantage of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
What collapse? Four days later, things have never looked better for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bielecki pitched a two-hitter and Ryne Sandberg hit his 30th home run 
Tuesday night at Chicago to lead the Cubs to a 2-0 victory over Montreal. Their 
lead in the East, with only 17 games remaining, has widened to 4 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs have a modest four-game winning streak, but it couldn't have come at a 
better time. Unlike the American League, in which contenders rarely seem to 
face each other in the stretch, National League contenders seem to be playing 
each other nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
That's why four in a row is so big. Two of the victories put the Cardinals into 
a tailspin; the last two have done the same to the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two bottom teams in the East, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, have 
done in the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki had been in a slump. But he was in complete control of the Expos and 
improved to 16-6. The 30-year-old right-hander is one of the big surprises of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Until he won a regular spot in the Cubs' starting rotation this spring, 
Bielecki spent much of his 10-year professional career in the minors. The main 
reason is that he didn't pitch well when he had the chance. In appearances with 
Pittsburgh and the Cubs, he was 12-19. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best game I ever pitched," Bielecki said. "Yet it could have gone 
either way." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos are six games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, New York 1 -- For a long time after getting hit over the eye by 
a fastball thrown by Mike Torres April 9, 1984, Dickie Thon's vision was 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors doubted he would ever have clear vision again. It has been a tough 
struggle for the shortstop who hit 20 home runs for Houston in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing wrong with his vision now. Thon hit his 13th home run with 
one out in the ninth inning at Philadelphia to put a severe crimp in the Mets' 
pennant hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Thon had hit only 10 home runs in parts of five seasons after the beaning. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was sweet music for Roger McDowell. McDowell, once the star of the 
Met bullpen, had been traded away earlier this season. He pitched two shutout 
innings to beat his old mates and drop them 5 1/2 games out of first place. Two 
of his four victories are against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets are 28-41 on the road, where they play 12 of their last 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, St. Louis 2 -- It's not enough that half of their pitching staff 
is hurt. Those Cardinal pitchers who aren't burdened by injuries are tired. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Magrane (18-8) is a prime example. After pitching better than anyone in the 
league for two months, Magrane has been mostly ineffective in his last three 
starts after winning seven in a row and 11 of 12. 
</P>
<P>
Errors by Willie McGee and Pedro Guerrero contributed to three unearned runs at 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
That made it easy for Bob Walk (13-10), who held the Cardinals to five hits in 
8 2/3 innings. Bill Landrum replaced him after Milt Thompson singled in the 
ninth and Guerrero tagged him for his 15th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero had gone more than 40 games without an error before he dropped a throw 
from catcher Todd Zeile on a sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 6, San Francisco 5 -- Dale Murphy hit a three-run home run to cap a 
five-run eighth inning rally at San Francisco by the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel appeared on his way to his 17th victory when he left after six 
innings with a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly Downs and bullpen ace Steve Bedrosian couldn't hold it. Murphy hit 
the home run off Bedrosian. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell hit his 43rd homer of the season for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, Houston 0 -- Bruce Hurst pitched a two-hitter and Roberto Alomar 
drove in four runs at San Diego as the Padres took a firm grip on second place 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (14-10) retired the last 14 as the Padres won for the 16th time in the 
last 19 games. They lead Houston by two games. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a pair of two-run singles.

For the majority of the decade, with respect to City Section 4-A Division 
football in the Valley, two teams have been as immovable as Jimmy Johnson's 
hair. Granada Hills and San Fernando, a combined 110-67-3 in the 1980s, usually 
finish the season wrestling Carson and Banning in the playoffs while other area 
teams are spending Friday night at home fiddling with the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the second season of Northwest Valley Conference play -- an 
eight-team alignment composed of 4-A teams in the North Valley and West Valley 
leagues -- the power brokers remain in firm control. And the rest? Even though 
three teams from each league qualify for the playoffs, most still feel like 
hounds fighting for scraps at the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
Taft Coach Tom Stevenson, throwing Kennedy into the equation, concedes that the 
North Valley League's terrible triumvirate should again whomp and stomp its way 
into the postseason. Last season, Taft finished 2-2 against North Valley foes. 
A repeat performance is unlikely, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"For anybody to split against the other side is a great goal, but it's not very 
realistic," he said. "The Big Three -- Granada, Fernando and Kennedy -- are 
just far above the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said last month that any team that emerged as a West Valley contender 
would have to play .500 ball against North Valley teams. He has since redefined 
his objectives. His new goal? To beat teams that are, well, in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be great if we went 2-2 against them, as we did last year," he said. 
"But I think we have to be more concerned about beating the teams in our own 
league." 
</P>
<P>
A West Valley inferiority complex is understandable. Granada Hills and San 
Fernando were a combined 12-2 against the rest of the conference and 7-1 
against the West Valley during the regular season in '88. Because league 
records include games against conference opponents, it's no small wonder 
coaches in the West Valley just want to break even without breaking their 
necks. 
</P>
<P>
Only Taft (6-5) had a winning overall record. Cleveland, El Camino Real and 
Canoga Park were a combined 16-24 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, which won the league title with a 25-22 victory over Cleveland in the 
regular-season finale, was bombed by Dorsey, 37-7, in the first round of the 
playoffs. Cleveland, which finished second, was beaten, 27-17, in the first 
round by Kennedy. Third-place El Camino Real was beaten by San Fernando, 16-0, 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the role of the scrappy upstart appeals to at least one coach, though. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an attitude you have to take," said Cleveland Coach Steve Landress, whose 
team pulled off the conference upset of the year when it beat eventual North 
Valley champion San Fernando, 20-10, on the road. "They all have excellent 
coaching and an abundance of speed and talent. If we were in the 3-A, we'd be 
an instant contender, but I like playing the good teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But with those teams, it's like fighting Tyson -- there's always the chance 
you'll get knocked out before you break a sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Yet while West Valley coaches generally expect the North Valley dominance to 
continue, they also believe West Valley teams, as a group, are stronger this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland lost All-City selection Sean Burwell but replaces him with Pat 
Bryant, an All-City baseball player. Landress says that Bryant is as good as 
any player he has ever coached, which covers a lot of ground. Landress coached 
Washington State running back Steve Broussard when both were at Manual Arts 
High. Broussard led the Pacific 10 Conference in rushing last season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland also has considerable size up front, and three-year letterman Curtis 
Hudson (6-foot-1, 255 pounds) is the anchor. The Cavaliers are also 
well-stocked at linebacker with starters Frank Diana and Will Johnson 
returning. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's chances of repeating received a shot in the arm over the summer when two 
talented transfers entered the picture. Irving Carter, a transfer from Antelope 
Valley, is expected to help replace graduated running back Kelvin Byrd (1,480 
yards, 13 touchdowns). Linebacker-wide receiver Darnell Hendrix, a transfer 
from Jefferson, might be the best all-around player in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Taft is also set at linebacker with returning starters Greg Bernard and Steve 
Lockridge, who will be joined by Hendrix. Taft's main hurdle: no returning 
starters on the offensive line for a team whose trademark is its up-the-gut 
ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, the league's best quarterback is Dave Erhardt of Canoga Park 
who passed for 795 yards last year and made quite an impact on opposing 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you can throw the ball like he can," El Camino Real co-Coach Mike 
Maio said, "you can equalize a lot of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park is also a year older and wiser, Coach Rudy Lugo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I knew we were in for some tough times," he said. "We only had five 
returning starters and we'd just been moved up to the 4-A level. We're still a 
young team with some real raw skill, but we'll be more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a quarterback that throws as well as Dave does and is as good an 
athlete as he is, you can score any place, any time." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real won four games last season, more than in its three previous 
seasons combined. After years of struggling with low-player turnout, there has 
been an upturn, although the Conquistadores are not a team large in stature. 
</P>
<P>
Any move toward the playoffs will be led by skill-position players and defense. 
Jamal Anderson and Lejon Carr return at running back and Ryan Marine also will 
play in the backfield. Kennard Durr gives the team outside speed at receiver. 
Quarterbacks Tony Bordwell and Evan Howland are new, but at least they are 
members of a large league fraternity: Taft and Cleveland also will start 
untested quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Troy Snyder and Chris Griggs, both returning starters, are back at 
linebacker, which seems to be a league strong point. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone for predictions? 
</P>
<P>
Said Landress: "It's flattering that some people think we're the team to beat . 
. . But I kind of like Canoga." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maio: "If everything goes like everyone says, I'd say it's up for grabs. I 
don't see any team being as dominant as last year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lugo: "Taft is pretty good and Cleveland always has good size . . . At 
this point, I'd say it's anybody's league." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stevenson: "Actually, if a couple of things work out like I hope they do, 
I like our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Disparity in the conference, parity in the league. Could be a close race.

The NBC ratings juggernaut rolled on last week as the network claimed six of 
the seven most-watched programs and recorded its 64th consecutive prime-time 
victory. Ratings released Tuesday by the A. C. Nielsen Co. showed that NBC 
programs last week had an average audience of 10.4 million households, compared 
to 9.1 million for ABC and 8.4 million for CBS. The full list of ratings is on 
Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* CBS took some consolation in the performance of "Paradise," the Western 
series that returned for its second season Sunday night. The two-hour episode 
was seen in about 14 million homes and ranked as the ninth most-watched show of 
the week.

<P>
Kiet Le was just 5 years old when he last saw his mother on the Vietnamese 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that pirates would harm the family's women and younger children, Kiet's 
father decided that only he and the boy would take that boat ride out of the 
war-ravaged country 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kiet's sister, Pauline, remembered that as they whispered their goodbys, her 
father promised to reunite the family soon. 
</P>
<P>
This week, everyone from Kiet's classmates at La Quinta High School in 
Westminster to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) is trying to fulfill that 
pledge and get Kiet's mother and two other siblings out of Vietnam. But the 
reunion will be bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
Kiet, 16, is in critical condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange after 
collapsing during a junior varsity football game Friday. He is connected to 
life-support systems in the intensive-care unit, his chances for survival 
"grim," his sister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Le, 23, who emigrated here by herself in 1982, said she has been 
working through U.S. and Vietnamese officials to expedite the emigration of her 
mother and two younger brothers. She hopes to delay telling them about Kiet's 
condition until they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Kiet's friends have visited him since Friday. They stay in his room, 
whispering "get well" into his ear. His closest friends are too young to drive 
to the hospital, so they car-pool with the upperclassmen, many of whom also 
know him well. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'I'm praying for you,' and I'm with him all the way," said Ryan 
Powell, 15, who has spent hours by his friend's bedside. "I told him I missed 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Pauline said her father, a gardener who speaks little English, had trouble 
grasping the seriousness of his son's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't believe that Kiet could be that sick. Then after he knew how bad 
it was, he became so tired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two of them now keep a vigil beside Kiet's bed. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell Kiet, 'Hang on, hang on.' I don't know whether he can hear us. But I 
know he cares about his mother. She has to see him before anything. . . ." She 
was unable to finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Kiet, a sophomore at La Quinta who played defensive end for the junior varsity, 
had huddled with the team before a play Friday during a game with Westminster 
High School, La Quinta principal Andrew McTaggart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, Kiet had tackled an opposing player. When Kiet's team came out 
of its huddle and lined up on the scrimmage line, Kiet stumbled and collapsed, 
McTaggart said. 
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to the medical center, where he underwent emergency surgery. 
Spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Tuesday that Kiet has considerable swelling of 
the brain and that doctors who treated Kiet believe that the cause could be 
acute trauma, but they are unsure. She declined to discuss his prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
After Kiet was sent to the hospital, the La Quinta Aztecs went on to win the 
game, said Kiet's friend, Ryan Powell. "We had no choice," he said. "We 
dedicated the game to him." 
</P>
<P>
Kiet's teammates have been collecting money for a scholarship fund in his name 
for two days, putting the money in a tissue box. But the donations grew to $600 
on Tuesday, too much for a small box to hold. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who has been asked by La Quinta officials to intervene on behalf of the 
Le family, said he has contacted the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, as well as 
officials in the National Security Council. He said the embassy is waiting for 
a response from the Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
If the Vietnamese government allows Le's family to leave, Dornan said, the 
United States would provide transportation because of the urgency of Kiet's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the hands of the Vietnamese government," he said. "The frequency of 
response is heartbreakingly erratic. We hope they will respond to pleas for 
human kindness." 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Le said the three family members have been on a waiting list and had 
been scheduled to emigrate within months. 
</P>
<P>
As she sat in the hospital waiting room Tuesday, she recalled how proud she is 
of her brother's accomplishments -- the number of clubs he has joined, the 
number of friends he has and the number of sports he has played. As she spoke, 
she clutched in her hands dozens of get-well cards from friends and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'If you wake up, I would let you do whatever you wanted to do.' 
He wanted to run for class president, but I told him no, he was too busy 
already," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Practical Joker 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta assistant principal Patty Howell said Kiet is mischievous and often 
played practical jokes. He once got two school identification cards made -- one 
in which he posed with a comical, happy face, the other with a sad-puppy-dog 
expression. He would flash them alternately when he had to show identification. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the kind of face that makes you smile," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
And Kiet had the kind of personality that made you want to be friends with him, 
said Bruce Tran, 16, who went to junior high school with him as well. 
</P>
<P>
They joined the football team in their freshman year, becoming close friends. 
</P>
<P>
They would eat lunch together and talk about girls, teachers and other school 
things. They talked about getting their driver's licenses and what car they 
would like to own. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, although not often, Kiet talked about his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered one time he was so excited because his mother was (eventually) 
coming here," Tran said. "He didn't talk about her a lot. But when he did, he 
was so happy, like he missed her a lot."

PROPONENTS OF TRAFFIC TAX AIR RADIO ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON and JEFFREY PERLMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of a half-cent sales tax to pay for Orange County traffic 
improvements launched an advertising campaign Tuesday with 60-second spots on 
major radio stations in the Los Angeles-Orange County area. 
</P>
<P>
The ads -- the first in what could be a bitter election fight -- urge radio 
listeners to return a questionnaire that only a select few will receive. The 
spots do not ask for support of the proposed tax, listed on the ballot as 
Measure M. Rather, the questionnaire, to be mailed soon, asks voters whether 
they would support a sales tax if it was earmarked for transportation projects, 
what kinds of projects they would want and how they feel about car-pool lanes, 
campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would increase the sales tax from 6 cents to 6.5 cents, raising 
about $3.1 billion for traffic improvements over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was begun after a Superior Court judge approved a settlement 
between Measure M supporters and opponents that calls for both sides to modify 
their written ballot arguments before Registrar of Voters Don Tanney includes 
the language in the voters' pamphlet that will be mailed before the Nov. 7 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the radio spots from Measure M opponents was minimal, since most of 
them said they had not heard the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an interesting approach," said Costa Mesa Councilwoman Sandra L. 
Genis, who opposes the proposed tax and who missed the commercials Tuesday. 
"I'm puzzled as to why they are still doing questionnaires when there have been 
so many already. I would imagine that it costs a bundle. It's typical Madison 
Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she said, Measure M critics may mail information to targeted groups 
of voters too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be pretty low-key," she said. "We think people will see what 
Measure M does and be able to decide for themselves whether it's what they 
really want." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Hoffenblum, the Los Angeles-based political consultant who is managing 
the pro-Measure M campaign, declined to say how many stations are running the 
radio spots or how much they cost. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do with this is increase the return rate on the 
questionnaires," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The radio spots will run for a week or two on stations throughout the region, 
Hoffenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
The results will be used to plan campaign strategy, Hoffenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore ordered Tanney, the county 
registrar, to change wording in the ballot arguments to reflect a settlement of 
lawsuits filed by both sides alleging that each had included inaccurate and 
misleading comments in its written ballot arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents will drop their claim that approval of the tax would result in a debt 
of "$18 billion, plus interest." Instead, the argument will say the measure 
would result in "potential billions in debt." The measure's supporters were 
pleased with the change because the argument now "accurately reflects that the 
debt isn't guaranteed," said Andrew Guilford, an attorney for Dana Reed, the 
treasurer for Citizens for Yes on M, the group supporting the measure.

LOTTO FRENZY PUSHES POT TOWARD $53-MILLION PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents emptied their pockets Tuesday to buy Lotto tickets as 
the jackpot pushed toward $53 million, which would be California's 
second-largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the county's estimated 2,200 Lotto ticket retailers reported that sales 
of the $1 tickets since the last drawing Saturday were five to 15 times the 
normal amount sold. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes increased after Saturday, when no one picked the winning numbers. 
The chances are expected to be in the 90% range that the winning combination 
will be selected in today's drawing at 7:58 p.m., said Joanne McNabb, a 
spokeswoman for the California State Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"When the jackpot is big and the sales are up," she said, "it's more likely 
someone will pick the number." 
</P>
<P>
Game operations were extended an extra hour until 11 p.m. Tuesday. Tickets for 
the drawing can be bought until 7:45 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
About $8.2 million in tickets were sold Monday, the best ever for a Monday, 
McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
Lesta Williams, an employee at Villa Park Pharmacy in Villa Park, said about 10 
people were waiting for the store to open Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At Reliable Drug Center in Tustin, among the county's best volume sellers of 
tickets, customers came during their lunch hours to buy up to 200 tickets each 
in the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can deal without eating for a couple of hours," said Anthony Davis, 28, a 
computer programmer at Continental Land and Title in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Store owner Norman Morris said 4,800 tickets were sold on Monday, 15 times the 
normal sales on that day. On Tuesday, as of 1:15 p.m., 4,700 had been sold, 
pushing toward a record for one day of 12,000 tickets, sold on Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we've been going, this might beat it," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis bought 30 tickets on behalf of 15 employees who pooled their money to buy 
a total of 125. Davis said he also would buy 20 more tickets for his father, 
who lives in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"Where can you go in this world and possibly come away with $50 million?" he 
said. "This might be my lucky day." 
</P>
<P>
Davis got one extra ticket, just for himself, because the drugstore gives away 
a free pick for every 20 bought. On his ticket, he selected six fours, because 
four is the size of family he wants to have. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a wife, a child and want another child," he said. "That would be a 
family of four." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is not just choosy about the numbers he selects but the stores he 
frequents. He likes Reliable Drug, he said, because "they always come up with a 
few winners. It's something about the machine." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was ready to buy tickets Tuesday. Olga Rhea, 72, of Tustin, was in 
line to cash in scratch-off cards, not to buy tickets. Instead, she planned to 
buy about $50 worth of tickets today. 
</P>
<P>
"Always wait for the day," she said. "I'd rather get the tickets on the day and 
put the whammies on the machine." 
</P>
<P>
Chances of picking the right combinations of numbers in the lottery are about 
14 million to one, McNabb said. Although these are slim odds, most customers 
said they had as good a shot at winning as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improving the Odds 
</P>
<P>
Customers were buying dozens of tickets, hoping that the more they bought, the 
more likely the lucky payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Some had even pegged what they would do with the winnings. Davis said he would 
use the money to help his parents and buy housing for 10 homeless people, even 
if he does not win it all. 
</P>
<P>
"A million bucks can go a long way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Carr, 59, of Corona said that if he wins, he will put the money in a trust 
for his grandchildren and take "one hell of a nice vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Carr bought 200 tickets for the drawing, having had some limited success in 
past drawings. He was cashing in six tickets worth a total of $136. 
</P>
<P>
"It pays off," Carr said. "Not often enough and not big enough, but we're going 
to do it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Like others, Carr said he bought more than his usual 50 tickets for this 
drawing because of the jackpot. He usually buys more as the jackpot passes $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Steady Habit 
</P>
<P>
But Joel Keefer, 26, who is stationed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, 
said he always buys five tickets each drawing, regardless of the higher 
jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not swayed by that," he said. "If you're going to hit, you're going to 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the others, Keefer said he will keep a low profile if he wins: "I would 
buy 20 acres of land in Pennsylvania, put a house on it and a big barbed-wire 
fence telling everyone to keep out."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MAN KILLED BY ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies Tuesday released the identity of a man who was 
shot to death when he tried to flee from two robbers along a dirt road in an 
unincorporated area north of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was Alfredo Garcia Lara, 59, who lived in a labor camp about two 
miles from where he and two companions were riding bicycles when confronted 
shortly before 7:30 p.m. Monday by the gunmen, Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen demanded money and ordered the three men to lie down on a dirt road 
paralleling Irvine Boulevard, west of Jeffrey Road about 200 yards north of the 
Irvine city limits, Olson said. When Lara tried to flee, he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were described as males in their early 20s, of medium height and 
slim build and wearing bandannas over their mouths. Authorities said the 
suspects took an undisclosed amount of money and fled in a red or rust-colored 
Camaro or similar car.

GIRL, 2 1/2, DROWNS IN APARTMENT COMPLEX SPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities said Tuesday that a 2 1/2-year-old girl accidentally drowned in an 
apartment spa in Placentia over the weekend despite attempts by a family 
friend, paramedics and hospital emergency personnel to revive the child. 
</P>
<P>
The toddler, Krystal Pittman of Apple Valley, was visiting an aunt at the 
Somerset Park Apartments. A resident found her Sunday at the bottom of a spa at 
the complex, Placentia police and fire spokesmen said Tuesday. A family friend 
removed the child from the spa, but she was unconscious and not breathing, Fire 
Department Capt. Jack Wallace said. The girl was taken to Placentia-Linda 
Community Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 6:35 p.m., Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia Police Sgt. Steve Toth said the incident has been ruled an accident.

TRAUMA NETWORK WILL BE STUDIED BY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County health officials said Tuesday that they will form a panel to 
study how to provide high-quality emergency medical care after the Fountain 
Valley trauma center closes in December. 
</P>
<P>
Citing unpaid patient bills and problems in keeping a neurosurgeon on staff, 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center last month became the 
third hospital since 1983 to drop out of the county's trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
Its departure leaves the county with only three centers for critically injured 
patients: Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, UCI 
Medical Center in Orange and United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Some health experts have warned that without Fountain Valley, trauma victims in 
northwest Orange County may have to wait longer and travel farther for care, 
and could die as a result. But several trauma specialists said Tuesday that the 
emergency network could be revamped to avoid a decrease in the level of patient 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Parker of Placentia-Linda Community Hospital suggested that the county 
could get by with two trauma centers if it upgraded emergency care at the best 
community hospitals. He suggested requiring such hospitals to provide blood 
banks and hire more doctors specializing in emergency medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Bade, medical director of Orange County Emergency Medical Services, 
said he would prefer to attract a fourth trauma center to replace Fountain 
Valley. However, Bade rejected the notion that medical care would worsen with 
only three. 
</P>
<P>
"This talk of the system crumbling and people dying -- I just don't see it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 local trauma specialists will be invited to form a committee to advise 
the county on how best to proceed. County officials said they hoped to have 
recommendations by early November.

CALTRANS NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES TIGHTENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reacting to escalating land costs and to Caltrans' plan to demolish a new 
office building in Santa Ana for widening the Santa Ana Freeway, the state 
Senate approved legislation that would require Caltrans to notify local 
governments of its potential need for specific parcels even before state 
highway projects are funded and have received environmental clearance. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, introduced by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City), was 
approved 27 to 4 and sent back to the Assembly for minor amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's bill requires Caltrans to identify all land parcels that it may need in 
the next seven years and tell city and county officials about them. 
</P>
<P>
"Costs of the Interstate 5 freeway reconstruction project have escalated 
sharply because of rising real estate values in Orange County," the Senate 
Rules Committee reported to the full Senate. "In some cases, lack of 
communication between Caltrans and local building and planning departments has 
allowed certain key parcels to be developed. Now Caltrans faces the prospect of 
purchasing these parcels for huge sums." 
</P>
<P>
The committee cited the three-story Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. building next 
to the MainPlace/Santa Ana shopping center on the north side of the Santa Ana 
Freeway. It was built in 1985 on a site bought from the city for $936,500. 
Caltrans now plans to buy the building and site, now worth a estimated $8.5 
million, and demolish it. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also criticized the "slow-moving Caltrans real estate bureaucracy" 
for failing to move quickly enough to acquire an abandoned gas station in Santa 
Ana that has been turned into a fast-food outlet.

BARBARA BUSH TO HONOR LATINA OUTREACH GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must have been a strange sight to the Latinas arriving at a Santa Ana clinic 
for a free gynecological examination: A rummage sale in the parking lot where 
other women were selling old clothes and shoes to make money for their 
fledgling organization. 
</P>
<P>
That was eight years ago, when the county chapter of the Mexican American 
Women's National Assn. needed money to continue sponsoring the free exams that 
have been offered each spring since then. More than 300 needy Latinas, many of 
whom had never had a Pap smear and most of whom did not speak English, have 
been helped through the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the ability to reach that person who would not usually get care," 
said Dr. David Lujan, an Orange physician who volunteered to work in this 
year's clinic in April. "They are fulfilling a role here that is not served" by 
the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the county group will be honored by its parent organization in 
Washington for sponsoring the clinics. Among those attending the awards 
luncheon will be First Lady Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"We really feel like we are coming of age," said Irene Martinez, president of 
the county chapter of the group, which goes by the name MANA. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only organization of Latinas in the county, where at least 155,000 
Latinas live, Martinez said. The group's 110 members range from homemakers to 
business executives, though most are professional women. 
</P>
<P>
The free clinics were one of the first projects organized by MANA, which has 
since developed programs to try to fight the skyrocketing high-school dropout 
rate among Latinas and to encourage more Latinas to become leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, MANA will be holding its second annual leadership conference for 
Latinas at the Southwest Senior Center in Santa Ana. The event will include 
workshops in both English and Spanish on such subjects as cultural transition, 
motivation and non-traditional careers. County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will 
speak about the political empowerment of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To Share the Skills' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we really want to get into," said Evelyn Colon-Becktell, a 
MANA board member, "is to promote development and leadership in our women. We 
want to share the skills we have gotten so that they don't have to start from 
scratch like we did." 
</P>
<P>
Another important issue for MANA is education, Martinez said. Nationally, 
statistics indicate that about half of all Latinos drop out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the dropout rate is even higher among Latinas, who are often kept 
out of school to care for younger siblings or those who get pregnant as 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, MANA began a mentor program called the Hermanitas Project (Spanish 
for little sisters), in which 50 Santa Ana High School students were paired 
with MANA members who are role models, counselors and friends. This year, the 
program is expanding to 250 students from the Santa Ana district and will 
include a youth leadership conference in November, field trips and awards. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope," said Martha Gallegos, MANA's vice president and a census outreach 
supervisor for Santa Ana, "they will turn to an organization like MANA when 
they need assistance, whether it's a problem at school or with their home life. 
We know what they're going through, and we're here to help them." 
</P>
<P>
MANA also hopes to work with the families of these girls, because there is 
often a reluctance in the Latino culture to allow young women to leave home for 
college or a new job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Helping to Educate Parents' 
</P>
<P>
"You either let go of them when they get married or you don't let go at all," 
said Martinez, director of programs and marketing for Orange County Community 
Consortium Inc. in Santa Ana. "These are the types of things that MANA can help 
address by helping to educate parents." 
</P>
<P>
But even when parents are persuaded to let their daughters go, it is often with 
some hostility. In those cases, MANA members can confer with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos said: "It's a real support group. (Latinas) come to the point where 
they are breaking away from some traditions, and they sometimes don't get 
support from their families. In MANA, you are among other women who are 
accepting you as family and giving you that support."

$57.5-MILLION PARKS BOND ISSUE IN IRVINE ENDORSED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BEL BRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to expand the city's network of recreational facilities, the 
Irvine City Council on Tuesday night endorsed a bond measure that would raise 
$57.5 million to build and maintain more community parks. 
</P>
<P>
If passed by voters on the March 6 city ballot, the bond issue would levy 
annual taxes of $120 per household and begin in the 1990-1991 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, about 100 acres of parkland would be purchased within five 
years. The bond issue also would pay for the redevelopment and maintenance of 
several existing parks. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran hailed the plan as the most comprehensive parks bond measure 
in county and state history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will provide for current and future residents of Irvine a park 
system that will have no rival in the entire state of California," Agran said. 
"It will be a park system that will go well into the 21st Century. We don't 
intend on going back year after year for additional funds." 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a last-minute change proposed by Councilman Cameron 
Cosgrove that would lower the tax to be paid by residents of the city's 
estimated 700 mobile homes. The council agreed to lower the annual tax to $60 
for mobile-home residents and to make up the difference by raising slightly the 
tax on commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's reflective of the unique nature of this issue," said Cosgrove, 
who said many mobile-home dwellers live on fixed incomes. "It responds and is 
responsive to the community. I think it is right in line." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan dissented, saying that mobile-home dwellers 
aren't the only Irvine residents living on fixed incomes. "I think that would 
be discriminatory. There are 15,000 seniors in Irvine, so I want to know what 
we do with the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove predicted that Irvine voters next spring will provide the required 
two-thirds vote needed for approval of the $57.5-million measure. "It is not a 
small amount, but it is an investment in the future," he said. "I have 
confidence this will go through in March." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the council endorsed an initial "wish list" of parks programs. Among 
those to be included were park improvements, additions and maintenance, bike 
and running paths, a senior center, a fine arts center and a gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Among the list of projects that may be built with the bond money: 
</P>
<P>
* A 22-acre community park for the Village of Woodbridge, at a cost of $11.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* A 52-acre community park next to the Civic Center, costing $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* A $3.8-million expansion of Harvard Community Athletic Park. 
</P>
<P>
* Redevelopment of a now-defunct 1.5-mile railroad path into bicycle and 
running trails, for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Expansion of the Irvine Fine Arts Center, costing $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of an additional 8.5 miles of bicycle trails in the Village of 
Northwood, for $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Funding of a working, model farm, including the purchase of farm house and 
development of a picnic area, costing $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Support of the Irvine Theatre, now being built on the UC Irvine campus, for 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* An additional gymnasium to be shared by Irvine High School and Harvard Park, 
costing $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the council moved to raise money for the parks through what 
is known as the Mello-Roos style of taxation, under which every homeowner would 
pay the same amount regardless of his or her income or the size of his or her 
home. Owners of rental properties would pay $120 for each home or apartment 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Over the term of the 20-year bond, officials said the annual tax would probably 
increase slightly. Commercial properties would also be hit with the tax, paying 
10.15 cents per square foot each year. (The amount was increased Tuesday night 
from 10.05 cents in reducing the tax for mobile-home residents.) 
</P>
<P>
In all, city officials said, 45% of the new tax would come from residential 
property owners, 50% from commercial property owners and 5% from owners of 
undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Irvine voters know what is good for the community and will approve 
of a tax raise," Agran said. "In regards to giving breaks to segments of the 
community, we are trying to address the question of low-income residents 
through other means. Cutting back on this ambitious program would place it in 
jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, the newly incorporated city approved a $16-million parks 
bond measure in what turned out to be a blueprint for a community now known for 
planning. Unlike its predecessor, the latest proposed bond issue would provide 
money for maintenance and operation of the city's parks.

WESTMINSTER EXPANSION PLAN ATTRACTS LOUD PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of loud, angry residents crowded into the Westminster City Council 
chambers Tuesday night and voiced opposition to a mobile-home park expansion 
project that would narrow two city streets and bring high density to their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Don Heise, who opposes the plan of Lee Miller, owner of Los Alisos 
Mobile Home Estates, said Miller's project is poorly designed because it "would 
eliminate sidewalks, reduce the width of city streets and result in more 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council took hours of testimony from nearly two dozen supporters and 
opponents, then voted 5 to 0 to postpone a decision on Miller's plan pending 
further study by city staff. The project has pitted hundreds of angry residents 
against Miller, a heavy political campaign contributor to city council races, 
who is trying to expand his 665-unit park an additional 121 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, has asked the City Council to give him about 15 feet of city property 
and the rights to a flood-control channel the size of six city lots. 
</P>
<P>
Miller wants to reduce the width of Lee Drive from 60 feet to 45 feet and 
Dorothy Drive from 60 feet to 43 feet. As proposed, the expansion would make 
Miller's one of the largest parks in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's 665-unit Los Alisos Mobile Home Estates is one of Orange County's 
largest and most expensive parks with rents exceeding $550 a month. 
</P>
<P>
As Heise spoke against the plan Tuesday night, many residents, including an 
overflow audience of 60 who sat in chairs outside the chamber and watched the 
proceedings on television, applauded and gave shouts of support.

'DEATH ALLEY' TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO BLINK RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Existing traffic lights on a treacherous stretch of Lampson Avenue in Seal 
Beach will be adjusted to flash red continuously from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. every 
night, a step ordered by the City Council after two fatal crashes there. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach Police Chief Bill Stearns said the stretch, Lampson Avenue from 
Heather Street to Candleberry Avenue, will also be posted with lighted or 
reflectorized signs setting the speed limit at 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, two men have died on that curve, known as "the alley 
of death." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Henry Vasquez, 19, of Norwalk died Sunday when his Jeep struck two power 
poles and overturned. Michael Clines, 19, of Seal Beach was killed Aug. 23 when 
his car struck and sheared off two of the trees that divide Lampson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated Clines' speed at 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The accidents brought renewed calls from residents of an adjacent residential 
tract for a reduced speed limit along that stretch, and for reinforcement of 
the wall that separates their homes from the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't stop the people from speeding, then we have to protect the 
residents," Patty Campbell told the Seal Beach City Council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said she is sometimes awakened by jolts caused by buses or trucks 
speeding along Lampson Avenue past her home. Some cars have crashed through the 
wall along the avenue, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns said that most accidents in the area have involved speeds in excess of 
65 m.p.h., and usually have occurred during late-night or early-morning hours. 
The police chief said that some drivers try to see "how fast they can take the 
curve and survive." 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered that the traffic lights begin blinking red, effective 
immediately.

TRW SALE OF MAILING LISTS CALLED INVASION OF PRIVACY

<P>
For years, Orange-based TRW Credit Data and a handful of other credit-reporting 
giants have earned a good living generating detailed reports on the ability of 
millions of Americans to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, the credit companies and their parent firms have found 
a new way to turn a profit by selling sophisticated mailing lists and related 
services drawing, in part, on credit information stored in their massive data 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an innovation that pleases everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Credit information is being used for secondary purposes -- purposes different 
from the one for which the information was gathered," said Robert Ellis Smith, 
publisher of the Washington-based Privacy Journal, which covers the 
credit-reporting industry. "This violates the intent of the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act." 
</P>
<P>
Selling credit data for use in direct-mail marketing efforts "is a privacy 
intrusion," said Janlori Goldman, Washington staff attorney for the American 
Civil Liberties Union. "That is where we think the act needs to be 
strengthened." 
</P>
<P>
"The war (for) privacy has already been lost," added Steve Hamm, past president 
of the National Assn. of Consumer Agency Administrators and administrator of 
the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs. "It's up to Congress to 
determine whether or not we're going to try to reclaim a small portion of that 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Goldman and Hamm are among 15 witnesses scheduled to testify today 
before a congressional subcommittee examining the 19-year-old federal credit 
privacy law and the degree to which TRW and its competitors keep faith with 
both its letter and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer affairs subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee is particularly interested in the issue of using credit 
information to generate mailing lists and consumer profiles, one staff member 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act, has found no grounds to halt the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that is not discussed directly in the act at all," said the 
staff member, who asked not to be named. "I think it's a growing concern of 
people. They get a lot of junk mail, and they wonder how they are being 
solicited." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Is Sold 
</P>
<P>
Along with TRW, which has the nation's largest credit reporting service, other 
major credit-check companies that sell information to be used in direct-mail 
solicitations are Equifax Inc. of Atlanta and Trans Union Corp. of Chicago. 
Together, the firms maintain about 400-million credit files on about 180 
million Americans. All three companies will be represented at the congressional 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for TRW said the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to 
protect the privacy of the 150 million or so Americans on which it maintains 
credit files. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are absolutely the industry leader . . . in protecting privacy," 
Michael M. Van Buskirk, vice president of TRW Information Systems Group, said 
in a telephone interview from his Orange County office. 
</P>
<P>
Four-year-old TRW Target Marketing Services, based in Richardson, Tex., draws 
on a broad mix of information to develop mailing lists closely tailored to the 
needs its direct-marketing clients, Van Buskirk said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that mix is information purchased from TRW Credit Data on the 
number and type of credit cards held by potential direct-mail customers and the 
customers' available credit balance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Request List 
</P>
<P>
For example, a firm could ask TRW to develop a mailing list of all Latinos in 
Orange County who carry bank cards and whose available credit balance tops 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Van Buskirk said the company's credit unit does not make negative credit 
information available to its credit-marketing subsidiary. He said TRW has 
developed procedures to protect the privacy of everyone whose name turns up on 
the list. For example, he said, the actual mailing is handled by a independent 
company that is not told of the financial criteria used to build the mailing 
list. The firm that paid for the list never receives a copy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, credit information sold by TRW Credit Data to TRW Target Marketing 
is passed on in a form that makes it virtually impossible for employees of the 
marketing company to learn the details of an individual's credit history, the 
spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith of the Privacy Journal said that argument misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared Testimony 
</P>
<P>
"Personal information is now freely flowing from a regulated environment 
(consumer credit reporting) to nonregulated environments (target marketing, 
direct mail, commercial credit-reporting, insurance)," Smith said in testimony 
prepared for delivery at today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Hamm and Goldman said they will argue for tighter controls on the 
dissemination of credit information without the specific consent of the 
individuals whose records are involved, especially to companies selling through 
the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Credit Reporting Act, signed into law in 1970, forbids credit agencies 
from sharing their credit data with anyone but an authorized customer. The law 
grants consumers the right to review their credit records and to receive notice 
of credit investigations. But it allows the agencies to authorize sales to any 
customer who, in the agency's opinion, has a "legitimate business need" to 
review the credit information. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem with the idea that the Fair Credit Reporting Act should 
evolve to more explicitly and specifically address this whole question of . . . 
direct mail marketing," Van Buskirk said.

<P>
SMALL O.C. FIRM HOPES BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTHLAND MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a small Orange County firm has its way, the $3-billion disposable diaper 
industry is in for a change. 
</P>
<P>
This week Vons' 350 stores in California and Nevada began carrying throwaway 
diapers that the manufacturer, American Enviro Products Inc. of Placentia, says 
are almost entirely biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks the first big breakthrough in Southern California by American 
Enviro, which has been selling the Bunnies diapers mostly in the Southeast 
United States since July. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between American Enviro's diapers and conventional disposable 
models, according to the manufacturer, is that the regular diapers take up to 
200 years to break down. American Enviro has developed a product that can 
dissolve within 1 1/2 to 2 years, said company President Robert Chickering. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the diaper, American Enviro's products are 85-92% 
biodegradable, Chickering said Tuesday. "Our goal is to make a product that's 
100% biodegradable," he added. 
</P>
<P>
American Enviro is not the first to come up a diaper using plastic that quickly 
rots. At least two other firms already market biodegradable diapers, which are 
supposed to decompose quickly through natural processes once they are 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
If the manufacturers are right, they could be going a long way toward solving a 
big solid-waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of babies in the United States wear disposable diapers, totaling up 
to 18 billion discarded diapers each year -- which account for as much as 2% of 
U.S. landfill use. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the plastic-and-paper diapers do not decompose 
once they are thrown away. Instead, they become a potential source of viruses 
and bacteria that cause infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
The biodegradable diapers use plastics mixed with cornstarch that allow 
microorganisms to attack the plastic once it is in the soil, Chickering said. 
There are also enhancers in the plastic that allow the plastic to break down 
even in landfills, where the lack of air and moisture makes decomposition 
virtually impossible, according to Chickering. A biodegradable absorbency 
powder also is used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The technology has been available for 10 years. What has happened in the past 
two years, Chickering said, is that it has become practical and cheap enough to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Bunnies diapers retail for about $9.99 for 32 to 60 diapers, 
depending on the size. (Vons, which sells all baby products at wholesale costs, 
is selling them for $9.40 per package.) Conventional disposable diapers retail 
for $9.99 to $10.25. 
</P>
<P>
Since American Enviro began shipping Bunnies in July, about 7.5 million have 
been sold at retail outlets including Longs Drugs, Target stores and Lucky 
Stores Inc.'s Northern California supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Chickering estimates the 9-month-old, privately held 
company will have sold 65 million to 75 million diapers. The products are 
manufactured under contract in Porterville, Calif., Eau Claire, Wis., and 
Indianopolis. The firm employs five people at its Placentia offices. 
</P>
<P>
The disposable diaper market is dominated by Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. and 
Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Cincinnati-based Proctor &amp; Gamble, the largest disposable 
diaper maker, sells $1.65 billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both major manufacturers have said that their diapers are as 
biodegradable as any on the market. Both are skeptical about claims by the 
biodegradable makers. 
</P>
<P>
But American Enviro and some retailers are unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned as a grocery company about the environment and want to 
offer an environmentally friendly product," said Mike Roberts, grocery buyer 
for El Monte-based Vons Cos. "We have documentation from (American Enviro) and 
their test results. . . . We want to be the first (supermarket) to offer a 
biodegradable product."

DEEJAY WHO CAN TALK A BLUES STREAK WILL PLAY AT NEWPORT BEACH CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bluesman Bernie Pearl can joke about the kind of show that he'll put on at 
Newport Beach's Lido Cafe tonight -- suggesting it will be "drunken animals on 
stage savaging the music" -- with little worry that he'll be taken seriously. 
Known chiefly as the host of KLON radio's Saturday morning "Nothing but the 
Blues" show, Pearl has a rock-solid reputation for treating the blues with 
respect and fluency. 
</P>
<P>
Along with proselytizing "the real thing" over the airwaves for the past nine 
years, Pearl sired the successful Long Beach Blues Festival (entering its 10th 
year this weekend), has taught blues history and blues guitar at USC and Long 
Beach State, has worked actively to book local blues acts and has himself 
performed the music since the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Although his radio show has become a rallying point for the Southern California 
blues scene (averaging 25,000 to 30,000 listeners, according to the Arbitrons), 
Pearl said he feels most fulfilled when he is out playing the blues himself. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old guitarist/singer is joined in his Bernie Pearl Blues Band by 
fellow guitarist/singer Terry DeRouen, sax man Hollis Gilmore, bassist Mike 
Barry and drummer Albert Trepagnier. Guesting with the band tonight will be 
local legend and sizable showman Harmonica Fats. Among the musicians' 
credentials: DeRouen's long stint as bandleader for the late Big Joe Turner, 
Gilmore's backing of the equally departed Percy Mayfield, and Harmonica Fats' 
role as a recording studio staple, working sessions with everyone from Bill 
Cosby to Lou Rawls to Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl said his band delves into a variety of blues styles from '30s country 
finger-picking and slide to more contemporary electric standards. It is in 
presenting this depth and variety that Pearl's own, unique background comes in 
handy. As the younger brother of Ed Pearl, founder of the Ash Grove, a club 
that was Los Angeles' Mecca of blues and folk music through the '50s and '60s, 
Pearl learned to play firsthand from such masters as Lightnin' Hopkins, Mance 
Lipscomb, Fred McDowell, Bukka White and Brownie McGee. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, Pearl was a person on whom blues musicians would rely to 
assemble backing bands when they were in town. That led to touring work with 
Big Mama Thornton, Freddie King and others. He recalls one such gig with King 
at the Anaheim Convention Center, where they shared the opening slots for Leon 
Russell with a young Elton John. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl said that along with their instrumental techniques, his blues mentors 
imparted to him the notion that "the music is not anything detached: It's not a 
technical thing but is all woven in with life style and history, what you do 
with your life, what you think and how you conduct yourself. The thing that 
they all tried to stress was that the blues had to be reality, something you or 
somebody else experienced, something you can feel. It's not about just coming 
out and playing a bunch of notes." 
</P>
<P>
While not exactly savaging the music, Pearl said, he tries not to make a museum 
piece of it either. "Sometimes I try to convey a sense of the history, to show 
people the rich variety in blues, and sometimes I just want to dive into the 
instrument, bring out as much as I possibly can and cause them to have a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Given that the music is drawn from the hard history of African-Americans, 
Pearl, who is white, maintains that there is some validity to the question of 
whether white men can play the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"When I listen to Blind Lemon Jefferson, Texas Alexander and Leroy Carr, the 
blues goes not only back in black history but is from the black experience. 
Whites can be excellent, they can get good at playing it and learn from it and 
do it well -- otherwise I would stop playing -- but as far as I'm concerned, 
the blues has not only to do with the black experience of the past but also 
with that ongoing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think instrumentally you could do a blindfold test and in some cases really 
not be able to tell the difference, but as far as creating or maintaining the 
blues as a black experience, by definition, whites are not part of that." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was heartened to see more young blacks competing in the recent 
talent search shows which precede the Long Beach Blues Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a self-perpetuating myth that young blacks don't like the blues. So 
black radio doesn't play that music, and people never get the chance to like 
it. If they aren't exposed to the blues on the radio, particularly to the 
younger bluesmen like Donald Kinsey or Joe Louis Walker, they aren't going to 
know that young blacks they can identify with are doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"The music reflects a black reality, and some of the younger black kids will be 
able to listen to John Lee Hooker and learn quicker than a white kid who has to 
completely re-acculturate himself for it, to have to say, 'My god, how do I 
suddenly put the skin of a man from Tupelo, Miss., on me?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's been over 20 years since blues has been popular with the general black 
population. But I'm hoping it may go the way of this black rock 'n' roll 
revival, where black kids are looking at rock and saying, 'This is music that 
we were in on creating, and we're not in on reaping it,' and are getting more 
involved in reclaiming it." 
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, Pearl will be the host of this weekend's KLON-presented 
Long Beach festival, though he is not entirely happy at not being allowed more 
creative input in the event he launched a decade ago (initially, he had booked 
the festival talent, as he did again in 1987). He does think the event, which 
has drawn up to 16,000 fans in past years, is indicative of the vitality of the 
blues scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty healthy and growing in popularity. There are lots of good 
blues records coming out, still a lot of vitality in some of the established 
blues artists and in a lot of the new artists coming up. There's practically a 
renaissance of black blues happening in Chicago now, and there's a generation 
of white guys locally, such as James Harman, who may be the salvation of the 
blues in this area. It's becoming part of the accepted music scene. . . . And 
you see B.B. King eating McDonald's on TV now." 
</P>
<P>
While blues music still may be given short shrift on most radio outlets and on 
video networks largely dominated by mainstream rockers, the music endures, 
Pearl said, because "all that liberated, joyous, hip-shaking moving around by 
whites, all came from the blues. It all came from the freedom and joy and 
celebration of the flesh, the celebration of real life that blues is. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the time when whites were listening to Rudy Valee while at the same time 
Lemon Jefferson was singing 'Come Get That Black Snake,' there has been a huge 
conversion. People like Elvis Presley were at the crossroads and absorbed 
certain elements of black culture that they brought to the whites. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has feelings, emotions, sex, infidelity, drinking, all that, but 
blacks talked about it openly, humorously and meaningfully in their music. 
Whites were prohibited musically from doing that until all of a sudden Elvis 
and the others adopted it. 
</P>
<P>
"The blues has a universal message, and even further than that, it is a window 
to African music for America. There's a whole different, life-celebrating 
culture there, and I think that's what the blues has allowed everybody all over 
the world to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernie Pearl Blues Band and Harmonica Fats play tonight at 8:30 at Cafe 
Lido, 501 30th St., Newport Beach. Admission: $3. Information: (714) 675-2968. 
</P>

O.C. MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: TONY NOMINEE STEPS IN AS UCI DANCE 
PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five-time Tony nominee Donald McKayle sounds a bit amused about his recent 
appointment as "permanent professor"' of dance at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I have, what is the word -- tenure?" he asked in a recent phone interview. "I 
have to learn all the jargon." 
</P>
<P>
But don't be misled. McKayle has taught at a number of prestigious schools, 
conservatories and private studios, including the Juilliard School of Music, 
Bennington College in Vermont and California Institute of the Arts in Valencia 
(as dean of the School of Dance for two years, as well as a faculty member, 
from 1970-75). 
</P>
<P>
"They all have their pluses and minuses," McKayle said. "But when you get a 
good bunch of students -- people who want to work -- at a university system, 
you know that you have them for a while, and you can watch their development. 
In some of the other areas, it can be somewhat transitory." 
</P>
<P>
McKayle will teach choreography and modern dance technique and "special 
projects which I will be able to tell you more about after I have a chance to 
know the student body, the faculty and the facilities." His classes at UCI 
begin Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that if I were going to give time to teaching, it was better to 
attach to some place that I felt would be a good place. Then I would tend not 
to go and come so much." 
</P>
<P>
A distinguished choreographer and dancer, McKayle was born in New York in 1930. 
After studies with Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham, among others, he went on 
to join a number of modern dance troupes and worked not only with Graham and 
Cunningham, but with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weideman, Jose Limon -- "all the 
early pioneers of dance," McKayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things I can call upon on a moment's notice that will explain 
particular movements. . . . It's all part of man's invention and reinvention 
and refilling this thing called the movement of the body." 
</P>
<P>
McKayle began choreographing in 1948 with such works as "Saturday's Child," 
based on a poem by Countee Cullen. "Games," created in 1951, has entered the 
repertory of the Alvin Ailey Repertory Workshop, Gloria Newman Dance Company, 
Ballet Hispanico of New York and, in January, Lula Washington's Los Angeles 
Contemporary Dance Theater in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other works include "They Call Her Moses" (1953), "Rainbow Round My Shoulder" 
(1959) and "District Storyville," (1961), among others. But even though such 
pieces focused upon the complexities of the black experience, McKayle, who is 
black, always worked with an integrated company. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the pieces I've done, which were celebrated when done as part of the 
black tradition, I look back at the original companies and they were always a 
mixed group." Rather than attempt to use black dancers exclusively, McKayle 
said, "I simply found people who were wonderful and said, 'I'm doing a dance, 
would you like to be in it?' " 
</P>
<P>
McKayle had his own company from 1951-69, and subsequently headed the 
now-defunct Inner City Dance Company in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, Broadway, film and television captured his attention. He 
has received five Tony nominations for choreography in such Broadway shows as 
"Golden Boy" (1964), "Raisin" (1974) and "Sophisticated Ladies" (1981), and 
various awards and nominations for his film and television work. 
</P>
<P>
But his later concert dances -- in which he ventured into more abstract 
movement -- never won the same critical respect that his earlier pieces found. 
Some purists also have questioned his career mix of serious art and commercial 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never thought purity was something to be worshipped," McKayle responded. 
"I also feel that people develop and change. . . . I have a broad approach to 
the art form. I'm not looking for it in one place." 
</P>
<P>
He sees that broad experience as a benefit for his students. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole history will be revealed as I work," he said. "It should be part of 
the knowledge you have being at a university -- how things were, how they 
developed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And having worked in so many different media and with so many different kinds 
of approaches to dance, I've also been very interested in developing the 
individual aesthetic of the student. That I think is very important -- to 
recognize offbeat talent and to nurture it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that one thing that is very important is that the students that come to 
us should have the ability to go in any direction they want to go. I can train 
someone to pursue what they have in their mind, not pace them into any one area 
or another. I don't feel that is the job of teaching." 
</P>
<P>
McKayle shows no signs of slowing down. He is writing an autobiography for Duke 
University Press, getting ready to move "Stardust," a musical he choreographed 
that has been playing in Florida, to the Kennedy Center in Washington, early 
next year, and finishing a four-year project with the American Dance Festival 
called "The Black Tradition in Modern Dance." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's important to have active professional people working with 
students, as well as faculty that are purely academic," he said. "I think it's 
important to fit themselves into the professional world, so it won't come as a 
great shock to them later."

TEEN ARRESTED AFTER CRASH IN IRVINE KILLS WOODLAND HILLS MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fatal crash on Culver Drive in Irvine tied up six lanes of rush hour traffic 
this morning and caused slowdowns on the Santa Ana Freeway after police closed 
the street for nearly 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Abel, 65, of Woodland Hills was killed Tuesday night when his vehicle was 
broadsided about 11:15 p.m. by a teen-ager suspected of drunk driving, Police 
Lt. Al Muir said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police closed all six lanes of Culver between Walnut Avenue and the entrance to 
the Santa Ana Freeway until 10:45 a.m., snarling traffic in both directions and 
backing up freeway traffic, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Muir said Abel was leaving the Walnut Village Shopping Center on Culver shortly 
after 11 p.m. when his car was struck on the driver's side by 19-year-old 
Michael Schuler of Irvine. Witnesses said Schuler's car was traveling 65 m.p.h. 
southbound on Culver just before the crash, Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler was treated for cuts on the face and back at Health Care Medical Center 
of Tustin and then arrested. He was released pending the results of blood tests 
for alcohol.

The United States and Nicaragua had their first high-level contact in almost 
five years last weekend when an assistant secretary of state took part in a 
meeting with President Daniel Ortega, the State Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Mullins, who heads the State Department's congressional affairs office, 
joined a congressional delegation for the meeting, which was part of a visit to 
several Central American countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration carried on a six-month dialogue with the Sandinista 
government that ended in January, 1985, when U.S. officials accused Nicaragua 
of negotiating in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
High-level contacts with Nicaragua were barred afterward. State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler indicated that the prohibition was not carried 
over into the Bush Administration.

HAHN FAULTS BRADLEY; 
</P>
<P>
CITY ATTORNEY FILES A CIVIL SUIT BUT NO CRIMINAL CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
HE SAYS MAYOR HAS NOT BEEN VINDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insisting that "no vindication of the mayor's conduct is intended," City Atty. 
James K. Hahn today sued Mayor Tom Bradley for allegedly failing to disclose 
properly several stock transactions but declared there was insufficient 
evidence to bring criminal charges against the embattled five-term Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn announced the six-count civil lawsuit, which seeks fines for alleged 
violation of state laws that require public figures to disclose their financial 
holdings, as he released a 1,165-page report on a wide-ranging and 
unprecedented six-month investigation of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lawsuit, Hahn said some related leads pursued by his 
investigators have been passed along to the district attorney and other law 
enforcement agencies for further investigation. He noted that Bradley's stock 
holdings are under investigation by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's report appears to bring to a close his office's role in investigating 
Bradley's personal finances and business relationships with individuals or 
institutions that did business with the city. It began in late March with news 
reports of Bradley's employment by Far East National Bank and Valley Federal 
Savings and Loan Assn., then was expanded to include the Task Force on 
Africa/Los Angeles Relations, whose executive director, a friend and business 
partner of Bradley, has failed to account for about $180,000 in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
The report addressed numerous allegations that arose in the press and elsewhere 
during the investigation, and in every case concludes there is not enough 
evidence to charge the mayor with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Adds Caveat 
</P>
<P>
"However," Hahn's report noted, "no vindication of the mayor's conduct is 
intended, implied or should in any way be inferred." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn devoted roughly half of his voluminous report to Bradley's relationship 
with Far East bank, which paid him $18,000 as an adviser throughout 1988. 
Bradley returned the money in March of this year when he learned news 
organizations were preparing stories about his bank employment. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding Bradley's dealings with Far East National Bank, the city attorney 
said: "The mayor clearly stepped into that gray area of the law between factual 
innocence and a chargeable offense, but our system of justice rightfully gives 
him and the rest of us the benefit of the doubt in such circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was prepared to respond to the report at 5 p.m. in his office, his 
aides said. He had balked at commenting on allegations against him throughout 
the Hahn probe. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's report had been seen as crucial to Bradley's political stature, as well 
as to Hahn's, and as a result City Hall had been gripped with a fever of 
anticipation over the past week. His decision not to bring criminal charges at 
this time, however, had been reported previously, and the main question was 
whether the city attorney would find any fault with the mayor's behavior beyond 
faulty record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given Advance Copies 
</P>
<P>
City Council members and reporters were given copies prior to an 11 a.m. press 
conference, at which Hahn commented on his findings. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we found no violation of the law doesn't mean that what the mayor 
did was right," a low-key Hahn said. "Public officials must avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict in the performance of their duties." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most surprising aspects of the report dealt with how Bradley came to 
be hired by Far East, and what bank Chairman Henry Hwang expected from the 
mayor in return. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped he can open some doors for us with . . . a major corporation: people 
that he might know that we are not able to get . . . because we're a very, very 
small bank," Hwang told investigators in a May 17 interview. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang previously had said Bradley's duties were to court foreign investors for 
the bank and did not involve any potential conflicts of interest with local 
firms or city business. 
</P>
<P>
But the report found that Hwang apparently made a "direct solicitation" for 
city business in January, 1988, when he wrote Bradley a letter spelling out 
what was needed. At least two other letters were found that indicated Bradley 
may have known at the time he was employed that the city did business with Far 
East. In returning the funds in March, 1989, Bradley said he had not realized 
such a relationship existed and would not have accepted the employment had he 
known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Circumstantial Evidence' 
</P>
<P>
Further, the report concluded "there is circumstantial evidence" that Bradley 
attempted to and "did use his official position to influence a governmental 
decision" to the benefit of Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony before a City Council committee last summer revealed that the mayor 
had called City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg on March 22 to inquire about an 
expiring $1-million city deposit with Far East. After the phone call, 
Rittenberg ordered that $2 million be deposited with the bank. Work sheets to 
make it look as if there had been competitive bidding were compiled and someone 
used white correction fluid to obliterate a reference to the mayor. Bradley and 
Rittenberg denied the mayor influenced the deposit decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This circumstantial evidence appears damaging and may call into question the 
mayor's credibility and judgment in some areas," the report said. "There is 
obviously no doubt that 'but for' the mayor's telephone call to Rittenberg, the 
treasurer's office would not have deposited" the funds in Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"However, merely proving that the mayor's phone call caused the treasurer to 
deposit those funds does not prove that the mayor intended to influence the 
decision of the treasurer," Hahn's report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Other Dealings 
</P>
<P>
Hahn and his five-member investigative team also probed Bradley's annual 
financial disclosure statements, the subject of the lawsuit, and referred 
information about his dealings with the troubled investment firm Drexel, 
Burnham Lambert to federal authorities. A preliminary federal investigation is 
still in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Hahn said he has sent copies of his report to the District 
Attorney's Office, the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the state 
Attorney General.

Salvadoran rebels today proposed a cease-fire in their country's decade-old 
civil war, prosecution of human rights violators and reduction of the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders made public their proposals at a news conference moments before 
renewing talks in Mexico City with representatives of President Alfredo 
Cristiani's rightist administration. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides said they have scant hope of negotiating an early end to the 
war, which has cost more than 70,000 lives. Three previous attempts to 
negotiate peace from 1984 to 1987 ended in deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Villalobos, a top leader of the leftist Faradundo Marti National 
Liberation Front guerrillas, and seven other rebel chiefs distributed a 
document outlining their proposals, which they said they will present to the 
government.

Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, will ban ivory imports from 
Africa next week, the International Trade and Industry Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
Masahiko Isono, a ministry official, said the ban will last at least until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has been under pressure to ban imports of ivory products to protect 
elephants, which are hunted for their ivory tusks. The United States, Britain, 
France and West Germany have banned ivory imports. Isono said Japan imported 
106 tons of ivory last year, compared with 143 tons in 1987. In 1983, Japan 
imported 475 tons, Isono said.

Commonly used high school textbooks too often give students a picture of 
American history that is without color, passion, point or interest, a study 
released by the American Federation of Teachers said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 158-page critique by historian Paul Gagnon analyzed five books and said 
they neglect the role of religion in American history, give short shrift to Old 
World roots and fail to explore deeply the thinking of such major figures as 
Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The writers, he said, "labor too hard to balance affirmation and negation, and 
the result is a detached neutrality, passionless about both the ugly and the 
beautiful moments in our history."

Gunmen attacked a judge's home in the cocaine center of Medellin, but police 
guards drove them off, authorities said today. Troops found caches of grenades 
and assault rifles near Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
One policeman was wounded in the assault Tuesday night on the house of federal 
Judge Laurentino Gallego Gil, a Medellin police spokesman said. The source said 
two police guards repulsed the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The assault followed the deployment of more than 500 soldiers and police 
Tuesday in Antioquia state, of which Medellin is the capital. They will bolster 
the more than 4,000 security force members already in the northwest region, 
where drug gangs stage daily bombings, shootings and arson attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of mourners on Tuesday attended the funeral of former Medellin Mayor 
Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez, who tried to rid the city of drug traffickers. Pelaez 
was assassinated on his way to work Monday.

PTL continued giving Jim Bakker fat bonuses even while it was losing money, the 
ministry's former finance director testified today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spending as if there's no crisis," Peter Bailey, the former finance 
director, said in a 1984 memo to Bakker and PTL Executive Vice President 
Richard Dortch, who was indicted with Bakker and pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey testified that he told Bakker in November, 1983, that contributions for 
that month totaled $4.7 million while expenditures were $6.8 million. Two weeks 
later, prosecutor Deborah Smith said, the board voted a $150,000 bonus for Jim 
and Tammy Bakker.

Angry that President Bush has yet to visit the oil-stained beaches of Alaska's 
Prince William Sound, the National Wildlife Federation sent pieces of the 
fouled shoreline to the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental group delivered to Bush and leaders of his Administration 
zip-lock plastic bags containing blackened, slime-covered stones from a beach 
twice treated by Exxon after its disastrous oil spill six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Each bag was labeled, "A Prince William Sound rock called 'clean' by Exxon." 
Included in the package was another small bag with an unstained stone marked, 
"A Prince William Sound rock the way God made it."

"We wanted each of them to be able to touch, to smell, to experience in a very

Hair accused Exxon of trying to fool the public by claiming the beaches have

MOSBACHER WARNS JAPANESE ON TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
RETALIATION BY CONGRESS POSSIBLE, U.S. AIDE SAYS

<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher warned Japan today that Congress may 
seek economic retaliation if Japan fails to make "measurable progress" in 
removing obstacles to open trade by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"If there isn't progress, both of us, the Japanese government and the U.S. 
government, face a difficult situation with our Congress," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm hoping we can work together to avoid these problems. I see no reason 
why there can't be measurable progress by spring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher made the comments to Japanese and foreign journalists at the Japan 
National Press Club on the second day of a four-day visit to Japan focused on 
bilateral trade issues and the opening of markets in the high technology 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Trade Talks 
</P>
<P>
His first trip to Japan followed by one week the start of a one-year round of 
crucial trade talks aimed at breaking down entrenched barriers to more open 
barter on both sides of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The United States claims that Japan is primarily to blame for a perennial 
$50-billion trade deficit with Tokyo because of economic practices that 
restrict the entry of U.S. goods and services into the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Japan argues that Washington shares responsibility for the huge trade imbalance 
because of its failures to cut its federal budget deficit and fuel its 
manufacturing industries with the money and expertise to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Under congressional pressure, President Bush last May named Japan as an unfair 
trading partner and is empowered under the 1988 Trade Act to impose economic 
sanctions against Tokyo if it fails to remove trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Results' 
</P>
<P>
Although a final report on the trade talks -- dubbed the Structural Impediments 
Initiative -- is not due until next summer, Bush has said he expects Tokyo to 
provide "positive results" by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher admitted during his meeting with journalists that the United States 
protects some of its own markets, limiting imports of steel, textiles, sugar 
and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few (protected industries), but these are exceptions rather than 
here (in Japan), where they are the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not only the largest, but the most open market in the world and 
unfortunately, Japan is among the most closed," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
He called for Japan to give its consumers "the same freedom of choice and the 
same benefits" enjoyed by consumers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Differences Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the Japanese public have to pay over $600 million for a locally 
developed communication satellite when an American satellite can be purchased 
for less than half that amount?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said a Ford Probe costs about $21,000 in Japan, about three times the 
purchase price in the United States. A round-trip plane ticket between Tokyo 
and Seattle also is triple the cost paid in America.

"Why should a Sanyo cordless telephone cost three times as much in Tokyo as it 
does in New York? It doesn't make sense," he said.

AUG. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION OFF 6.6% 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Domestic crude oil production dropped 6.6% in August compared with a year 
earlier, falling to the lowest daily output level in more than 25 years, the 
American Petroleum Institute reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The trade group's monthly breakdown of supply and demand in the United States 
also said August imports of oil and petroleum products rose 16.3% over a year 
earlier and supplied nearly half of American requirements for the second 
straight month. 
</P>
<P>
The report said year-to-date domestic oil production has been falling at an 
average annual rate of 5% to 6% compared with 1988, nearly double the decline 
of 3.2% for the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
The report said it is clear that production in all oil-producing states has 
been declining rapidly, even after adjusting for temporary production 
curtailments in Alaska caused by the March 24 Exxon oil spill.

DIGITIAL OFFERS 700 EMPLOYEES A LURE TO QUIT

<P>
Digital Equipment Corp. has offered 40 to 104 weeks of pay to 700 employees if 
they voluntarily leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
Digital, the nation's second-largest computer firm, has never had a layoff in 
its 31-year-history and says it has no plans for one. 
</P>
<P>
The company is, however, undertaking what it calls a "work force transition" to 
reduce its manufacturing payroll by 4,000 jobs this year through redeployment 
and retraining. Jeff Gibson, a Digital spokesman, said today that the voluntary 
severance package is being offered separately. 
</P>
<P>
The severance package was offered Tuesday to 500 workers at Digital's former 
systems manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H., and 200 employees based at other 
sites whose jobs are related to the Salem facility. 
</P>
<P>
Digital said it expects several hundred employees to accept the offer. Those 
who choose not to leave the company may be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense price competition and declining U.S. sales, the company in May 
froze the salaries of all of its 73,500 employees in the United States. 
Employees at foreign facilities were not affected because sales overseas have 
remained strong. Digital employs 125,800 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the severance package will include 40 
weeks of pay for employees with fewer than two years of service. 
</P>
<P>
Employees with three to 10 years of service are also eligible for 40 weeks of 
pay, plus three additional weeks for every year of service over three years. 
That means a 10-year veteran would get 61 weeks of pay. 
</P>
<P>
Employees with more than 10 years of service would get 64 weeks of pay, plus 
four more weeks for each year between 11 and 20. The maximum award is 104 weeks 
of pay.

Neiman Marcus is inviting its well-heeled clientele to put on a pair of spurs 
and recapture the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based retailer began delivery Tuesday of its Christmas catalogue, 
the annual wish book of the wealthy. For one cowpoke with $108,000, Neiman's 
will sell a hand-tooled saddle by Edward H. Bohlin Co., lavishly furnished with 
sterling silver and 18-karat gold. 
</P>
<P>
A cowboy ain't a cowboy without a horse, so for $4,000 and up Neiman Marcus is 
offering a selection of champion-bloodline painted horses from the Real Ranch. 
Those wishing to recreate the cattle drives of the Old West can reserve a pony 
to ride herd for a weekend at a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Texas is really in right now," Neiman spokeswoman Jan Roberts said. "From the 
President to 'Lonesome Dove,' Texas and the West are in vogue. . . . We thought 
we should get back to our roots."

MGM/UA TELLS $1.20-BILLION BUYOUT OFFER FROM UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MGM/UA Communications Co. said today that it has received a new buyout offer, 
worth an estimated $1.20 billion, from an unidentified New York Stock 
Exchange-listed company, topping an earlier $1.05-billion deal with Australia's 
Qintex Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The successor to the United Artists and Metro Goldwyn Mayer Hollywood studios, 
MGM/UA struck gold with its Oscar-winning "Rainman" last year but has had a 
spotty financial record in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new offer, all common stock owned by principal shareholder Kirk 
Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. would be acquired for $23.16 each, subject to 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Later, remaining shares would be acquired for the same price plus interest, at 
a total of about $1.20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation centered on a handful of Big Board companies as possible 
purchasers, including Paramount Communications Inc., Walt Disney Co., News 
Corp. Ltd. and Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list was Paramount, which failed in its bid to break up the 
Time-Warner merger and acquire Time Inc. in a $12.2-billion buyout offer. The 
maneuver was widely viewed as a takeover protection, and since then Paramount 
has been rumored to be looking for another acquisition.

Citing the success of the Charlotte Hornets, National Basketball Assn. 
Commissioner David Stern designated Charlotte as the host of the 1991 All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said Charlotte was picked over three or four other cities that he did not 
identify. He said Charlotte's reputation for devoted fan support helped swing 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to be somewhat subjective," Stern said. "You have to have spent a 
night of watching the fans of the Hornets assault the opposing teams, and see 
the kind of support that this area has given their team." 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets led the league in attendance as an expansion team in 1989.

LEMOND SIGNS $5.5-MILLION PACT

American Greg LeMond, winner of this year's Tour de France and the cycling 
world championship, said today that he has signed a three-year $5.5-million 
contract with the French Team Z cycling organization. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, richest ever in cycling, was announced at a news conference by 
LeMond and Roger Zannier, the president of Z, a children's clothing 
manufacturer. Zannier said one or more partners would join in backing the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the possibility between 7-Eleven, Toshiba and Z. I analyzed very 
carefully every team," LeMond said. "I believed that Z was the best one for me 
because they have the riders I need, which are climbers. I think the most 
important for me is to have a strong team in the Tour de France." 
</P>
<P>
Among LeMond's new teammates are Robert Millar of Britain and French cyclists 
Ronan Pensec and Eric Boyer, all known as strong climbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy because we now have on our team a great leader," Zannier said. 
"I think we will now be a winner because we now have a great champion." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said he made his choice about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At the world championships (Aug. 27), I made my decision that for me, my 
career, I believed that Z was the best," LeMond, 28, said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the entire Z team will ride on Greg LeMond-model bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said his whole salary is covered by a French bank guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Although LeMond did not give the yearly breakdown, in response to a question he 
said he would probably earn at least $2 million in the final year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be specific about it. I am embarrassed to talk about it," 
LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
The highest previous reported salary for a cyclist was the roughly $800,000 a 
year provided in a contract to Ireland's Sean Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, LeMond will be able to race for Coors in exhibition 
races in the United States but not in regular competitive events.

U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange today was named to the four-man lineup that 
will compete in golf's Skins Game in November. 
</P>
<P>
Strange will join Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Ray Floyd in the 
made-for-television competition at La Quinta, Calif., Nov. 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, Trevino and Floyd were named earlier. The selection of Strange by a 
panel of golf experts completes a field that duplicates the 1988 line-up, Don 
Ohlmeyer, president of Ohlmeyer Communications, said in his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
In the Skins Game, the four players compete for a designated amount of money on 
each hole. If no player wins the hole outright, the prize money is carried over 
to succeeding holes until one player wins a hole. Total prize money is 
$450,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Skins Game will be televised nationally by NBC.
