YOUTHS KEEP IN TUNE WITH THEIR ROOTS AS MARIACHIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA BARCELONA, Barcelona is a Los Angeles-based free-lance journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They refuse to lose touch with their roots. They cling to the mariachi 
tradition that connects them to their past. 
</P>
<P>
They are the young mariachis from Belvedere Junior High School, 10 female 
violinists and five males who play the trumpet, the "vihuela," the guitar or 
the bass guitar. 
</P>
<P>
They have rekindled their pride in their Latino culture despite the peer 
pressure usually exerted on those who adopt a style not yet stamped with the 
general seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
The mariachi "lets me know where I came from. . . . It makes us feel real 
special . . . ," said 15-year-old Consuelo Monreal. 
</P>
<P>
Monreal and other members of Mariachi Olimpico say they have been inspired by 
Linda Ronstadt and her Spanish-language album "Canciones de mi Padre," from 
which they do a rendition of "Y Andale." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that she sings the songs, I like them more," said 16-year-old Norma 
Valenzuela. She adds that during a recent trip to Mexico she noticed that 
students there are very involved with the mariachi tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a lot of people dancing to mariachis. All young. It is very popular with 
the young people," she said, although that doesn't mean they listen any less to 
U.S. music stars. 
</P>
<P>
The situation seems to be different in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mariachis are part of the cultural heritage of East Los Angeles, but many young 
Latinos are afraid to listen to "the music of their parents," said Adolfo 
Martinez, Mariachi Olimpico director. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that easy to persuade a group of young people born and schooled in 
the barrio to form a group to play rancheras, sones, and other songs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Before, that type of music was "almost a taboo for most," he said, referring to 
the cultural conflicts faced by Latino teens. 
</P>
<P>
The Belvedere mariachis, who have been playing together since January, say they 
are proud to be part of the group. 
</P>
<P>
What motivates them to stay after school four hours a week for rehearsals? 
</P>
<P>
"If you have your parents' support, it encourages you to do better, said 
Lorraine Feesago, 13. 
</P>
<P>
Other students approach their parents to have the Spanish-language lyrics 
explained to them, which opens up new avenues of communication between the two 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand each other better now," says Elizabeth Nunez. Nunez's mother 
understands English but doesn't speak it. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of earning a living as mariachis while attending college is not 
out of the question for the young musicians. Several raise their hands when 
asked if they'll continue playing after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I got involved with this, I forgot about the idea of ever leaving the 
trumpet. . . . I'm going to stick it out with the mariachi," said Jose Ramirez, 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The Belvedere minstrels also play in public and have raised $870 of the $4,000 
they need to buy typical mariachi outfits. In August, they played in front of 
300 guests at the 60th wedding anniversary of violinist Monreal's grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in black and white, they sang about love, life, the land and the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Although sometimes sad, the mariachi's music teaches us to take life 
philosophically, says ethnomusicologist David Kilpatrick, who conducts the 
Roosevelt High School group, apparently the only other mariachi operating in 
the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that it would be a good idea for other schools to promote the formation 
of young mariachis. "When you play music together, you really do get close, so 
it's a good way of helping to integrate the schools."

HERITAGE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENT WHO DIED OF CANCER IS INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, Rodriguez is a free-lance writer based in Whittier. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As students returned this month to Cal Poly Pomona, missing from the student 
body was an inspirational 19-year-old, Cindy M. Vega of Whittier. No one there 
misses her more than her fellow members of the Society of Hispanics in Science 
and Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Vega, a 1987 graduate of St. Paul High School, had been battling cancer for 
more than a year. She died July 14 at City of Hope Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, she was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (cancer of the 
lymph tissues). As a result, Vega, a chemical engineering major, was forced to 
leave school. After receiving chemotherapy, Vega made another attempt at 
school, remaining active and returning as president of SHSE's fund-raising 
committee at the college. 
</P>
<P>
But Vega's return to college was cut short after doctor's discovered leukemia 
cells in her bone marrow. After a transplant of bone marrow donated by her 
brother Xavier, doctors told the Vega family that the cancer was terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, she died. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever wanted in life," she had told her mother, Angie Vega, "was to go to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
"Her heart was in the books," said her father, Margarito. "Her last moments 
were concern for her brother. She left us with beautiful memories. She was the 
oldest of 19 grandchildren. She knew she was an example. She was very aware of 
her role. She felt a sense of responsibility (to promote education)." 
</P>
<P>
"Cindy never gave up hope," said fellow SHSE member Bernadette Duran. "We spoke 
during spring break. She spoke about returning to school this fall. She had 
such an optimistic outlook." 
</P>
<P>
Ofelia Rubio, president of the SHSE chapter, spoke of mourning. "We have lost 
someone, but she would want us to go forward. Education was so important to 
her. She had such a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Members of SHSE, Rubio said, are contemplating honoring Vega by creating a 
scholarship in her name, dedicating a planned organizational history book in 
her honor or creating a special award for the member with the best attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Vega was also very active in Advancing Careers in Engineering, a student 
outreach committee of SHSE. "Her motivation," Salvador S. Zambrano, head of 
that committee, said, "was to help others." 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing that she was battling cancer," Rubio added, "she would go out of her 
way to talk to high school students and their parents, to use herself as an 
example, to let them know the importance of education." 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, Zambrano and officers of SHSE presented their organization's 
green and gold banner to the Vega family. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was just about to die," her father recalled, "I asked her if she had 
any last words. . . . She replied, 'I love everybody.' "

FILM ON KILLING OF PRELATE PORTRAYS TERROR BEHIND SALVADOR REFUGEE EXODUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAFAEL PRIETO ZARTHA, Prieto Zartha is a Los Angeles-based free-lance 
journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In God's name . . . I beg you, I beseech you, I order you: Stop the 
repression." 
</P>
<P>
Those words, and a crack shot through the heart, climax "Romero," a film about 
the life of Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo Romero, archbishop of San Salvador, who was 
assassinated as he celebrated Mass on March 24, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Romero's statement, directed at his country's military, sealed the death 
sentence for the prelate, whose tenure as archbishop is brought to life in this 
Paulist Brothers' production. 
</P>
<P>
Romero's character is portrayed by Raul Julia, a Puerto Rican actor whose 
performance depicts the archbishop's transformation from a reserved and passive 
man of the cloth, with close ties to some of El Salvador's wealthiest families, 
into an outspoken defender of the persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
In the months preceding his death, as documented in the film, Romero criticized 
the violent acts of the Salvadoran left and right and brought upon himself the 
enmity of the military, the rich and the powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in Mexico with a cast composed almost entirely of Latino actors, Ana 
Alicia and Eddie Velez among them, the film recreates a period of tension 
between the Catholic Church on the one side and the Salvadoran government and 
military on the other. The action takes place in the late 1970s and early '80s, 
a time in which government-supported violence escalated to include several 
Catholic priests among its victims. 
</P>
<P>
The film depicts the alliance between the ruling class and the army, as well as 
the attitude of some church officials more directly committed to those holding 
power than to the rest of their parishioners. It also shows the violent 
activities of the right-wing death squads and the church's concern for the 
"desaparecidos" (the missing ones). 
</P>
<P>
Some scenes recall the brutality of Latin American military personnel 
previously brought to the big screen in films such as "Missing." 
</P>
<P>
The on-screen action brings to light one of the most important reasons for the 
exodus of Salvadorans to the United States: the 60,000 killed in political 
violence. The exodus has brought an estimated 400,000 Salvadorans to Southern 
California, nearly 150,000 to San Francisco and has given a Spanish touch to 
Washington brought by 100,000 Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Rivera, one of the thousands of refugees, said the film struck him 
with "visceral impact." 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me hard . . . it took me back to the past," said Rivera, a member of 
the literary group "La Cebolla Purpura" (The Purple Onion) at the time of the 
clergyman's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"The day of Romero's death I was having dinner in a small restaurant in San 
Salvador. . . . I heard the news on the radio. The city went dark . . . there 
was a tense calm. That night I thought, 'If they've killed him, what could 
happen to the rest of the people?' . . . A month later I left El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, Rivera helped found the Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo Romero Clinic, 
offering aid to Central American refugees. Rivera now works at the USC Civic 
and Community Services Office. 
</P>
<P>
"This film will make all of us Salvadorans remember," said Rivera, recalling 
that Romero's example was one of the inspirations for establishment of the U.S. 
sanctuary movement to harbor Central American refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The film has not been dubbed into Spanish; it is being shown in English with 
Spanish subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
According to T. C. Rice, marketing vice president for Four Seasons, the film's 
distributor, the movie was not dubbed because of the cost involved and the fact 
that it was not intended for release to Spanish-language theaters. He called 
those cinemas "ruined theaters where exploitation Spanish-language movies are 
being presented." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dennis McCann, an executive of the Carranza Group, the firm that advises 
Four Seasons on matters concerning the Latino market: "To go to these theaters 
(would be) diminishing the image of the quality of the film."

Leona Helmsley, hotel queen, probably got what she deserves ("Hotel 'Queen' 
Helmsley Convicted of Tax Fraud," Part I, Aug. 31). As they say: "She got her 
comeuppance." Now if Uncle Sam can collect from all the other "tax cheaters" 
perhaps our large national debt can be made to look more respectable. Should we 
say about $85 billion more respectable?

PILOT'S LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a private pilot, with an instrument rating, I take flying seriously. I was 
outraged upon reading about the new regulations (The Nation, Sept. 1) making it 
easier to obtain a pilot's license! If anything, I have always felt that the 
regulations should be more stringent. There are enough incompetent pilots in 
their air right now. 
</P>
<P>
Flying is serious business; it is not a game. Planes are not toys on a string. 
Every pilot has a responsibility for his/her own safety as well as the safety 
of everyone else in the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the National Transportation Safety Board and other private pilots 
will put enough pressure on the FAA to reverse that decision and not let 
inexperienced thrill-seekers endanger our skies.

BILINGUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only recently, Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos decried the sorry state of 
our educational system. We are lagging behind other nations. We are not turning 
out literate students. We have far too many dropouts. Though spending billions 
more, we are getting less for our educational dollars. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, we have had mandated bilingual education, which 
legislators have interpreted to mean native language instruction for our Latino 
students. Those students who are not Latino but happen to be in a 
Spanish-instruction class get one-half or one-third of the teacher's time. 
</P>
<P>
And now Cavazos advocates more native language instruction (Part I, Aug. 26)? 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
English instruction programs, with native language support, have worked for 
decades for all other language minority students, also for Latino adult 
students. Why can they not work for Latino children?

PEDAL-HAPPY CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bicycles outnumber automobiles 2 to 1 in the world, the Worldwatch Institute 
reports, and pollution-free pedal power would be even more important if 
governments planned as well as those of the Netherlands and of enlightened 
California cities such as Davis and Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Of course bicycles also contribute to the health of cyclists while reducing the 
demand on fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia D. Lowe, who did the research, has come up with all sorts of surprises. 
Some 8% of daily downtown trips in Manhattan are accomplished on bikes, a 
higher percentage than such places as Toronto, London or Sydney, but far behind 
the 77% record in Tianjin, China. The ratio of bicycles to cars is 250 to 1 in 
China, while the United States is one of the few nations with more cars than 
bikes: an estimated 137 million automobiles and only 103 million bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
The report singles out the Netherlands as "the most bicycle friendly of all 
industrial countries," demonstrated by the construction of direct and 
uninterrupted cycling routes so that up to half of urban trips are made on 
bicycles. Having land flat as a pancake doesn't hurt. The report also notes the 
extraordinary success in Davis, which encourages the use of bicycles, which now 
account for 25% of total town trips: "Cycle trailers filled with groceries or 
children are not an unusual sight." And it cites Palo Alto for building 
ordinances that "ensure that new developments provide secure bicycle parking 
and showers for employees." 
</P>
<P>
"Cyclists' needs are seldom addressed in public policy, and only in China and a 
few Western European nations do traffic data count bicycles among forms of 
transport," the Worldwatch report laments. "The U.S. Department of Commerce 
refers queries about bicycle sales to its division of toys and games."

RACIST KILLING IN BENSONHURST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to explain what racism is. I refer to your front-page article on 
Bensonhurst (Sept. 2) and some of the comments made by the Rev. Charles 
Fermiglia. Fermiglia suggested that it is a fact that blacks commit a 
disproportionate number of violent crimes, and blames the community's attitudes 
on the mass media. While it is true that blacks commit more violent crimes, it 
also is a fact that 90% of these violent crimes are committed by 10% of the 
population. Blaming an entire group for the actions of a few of its members is 
called racism. 
</P>
<P>
Fermiglia was partially right about the media, however. Partly he was just 
trying to shift blame from his beloved Bensonhurst, but partly the media does 
over-dramatize black crime. This is because it sells. A newsperson who suggests 
to his editor that there should be a moratorium on reporting black violence, in 
the public interest, will be laughed at. 
</P>
<P>
Fermiglia's sin is that he so loves his community of Bensonhurst that he is 
blind to the facts. He would probably defend his community against Jesus if 
Jesus happened to wander into the neighborhood and get crucified!

RACIST KILLING IN BENSONHURST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some members of the Bensonhurst emigre community were heard fiercely 
proclaiming their "100%" Italian origins at several of the African-American 
demonstrators who marched through their xenophobic neighborhood in the 
aftermath of the tragic Yusuf Hawkins murder. Very interesting indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The grandparents of the young men accused of destroying Mr. Hawkin's life may 
well have met some of the black American G.I.'s who fought and died in Sicily 
and Southern Italy trying to rid that ancient land of its home-grown fascist 
regime and their Nazi allies during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not certain what those valiant soldiers thought of the locals as they 
slogged their way up the Italian boot, dotting the countryside with the fresh 
graves of their dead. 
</P>
<P>
My late uncle, Dr. Arvin DeBerry, was a Howard University-trained dentist in an 
all-black Army division that landed in Sicily. He and his fellow dentists, not 
much older than Mr. Hawkins, set up chairs in cow pastures to provide the local 
peasantry -- no doubt some of the relatives of the good people of Bensonhurst 
-- with the first professional dental care many had ever received. The 
outpouring of gratitude was overwhelming. The young black dentists were 
showered with food, wine, invited in for family meals and, yes, several did 
return home with Italian war brides. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how one generation's savior is another's "animal, crackhead, n-----" to 
name a few of the epithets hurled at peaceful members of the black community 
who mourned the loss of their young son. It is all such a pity.

DEBATE OVER BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column by Edward McMahon "That 'Upscale Art' Quality Claimed for L.A.'s 
Billboards Is Actually Litter on a Stick," Op-Ed Page, Aug. 22) is the product 
of a fertile imagination which McMahon unleashes freely, totally uninhibited by 
the truth, on whomever will listen. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he claims that despite the Highway Beautification Act, billboards 
are "still going up everywhere." Not true. The objective of the act was to 
control billboards, not ban them. There were 1.2 million billboards in 1965; 
only 500,000 remain today. California granted 35,000 permits for outdoor signs 
in 1965, only 13,000 permits in 1987, down two-thirds. That's control. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon claims communities that banned billboards always prosper. Not true. 
Vermont banned billboard since 1968 and according to the latest census 
projections will be the 50th state in population by the year 2000. Vermont 
already has the lowest per capita retail sales of any state in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon claims that the billboard industry pays more honoraria to Congress than 
any other industry except defense and tobacco. Not true. On July 11, the 
Washington Post printed a list of the top 20 honoraria contributors and the 
outdoor industry is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
He claims that we oppose regulation. Not true. We are the most regulated 
industry in America, affected by laws passed at every level -- federal, state 
and local. We don't want signs everywhere or in the wrong places. We do want 
them to be effective -- to sell, and we want them to blend in -- to complement 
the aesthetics of the communities they serve.

DINKINS' KINDER, GENTLER STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York's Mayor Ed Koch started years ago to dig the political hole he could 
not climb out of on Tuesday. His attacks on Jesse Jackson during last year's 
presidential primary stampeded black voters toward anybody but Koch. What 
started out as his fetching and, for New York, fitting brashness turned sour 
for a city losing ground against crack cocaine and corruption while racial 
tensions grew. Judging by the polls, the last shovelful was Koch's criticism of 
marchers protesting the recent murder of a young black man, Yusuf Hawkins, by a 
gang of whites in Brooklyn. Virtually all black voters and one-third of the 
white voters turned to the quiet man in the Democratic race, David D. Dinkins, 
the black president of the borough of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Dinkins is no shoo-in against Republican Rudy Giuliani, the former 
U.S. attorney, in November, but at least New Yorkers may get to see whether 
calmer voices will work better in trying to guide major cities out of the 
shared wilderness of second-rate schools, a shortage of decent housing, the 
AIDS pandemic and crumbling neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
On election night, Dinkins made his first move away from Koch's slashing style 
and his willingness to pit neighbor against neighbor. When Koch's name came up 
at the Dinkins victory rally, the crowd booed. Dinkins hushed the crowd. "I'm 
the guy who brings people together," he said. The kinder and gentler approach 
may be catching. Koch showed up, visibly tired from the long campaign, urging 
Democrats to close ranks and promising to campaign for Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
New York's problems, like those of most big cities, seem overwhelming, 
especially compared with the resources available to deal with them. A change 
from verbal confrontation to quieter calls for consensus and cooperation is not 
likely to provide a quick fix, but it is better suited to the long, tough task 
ahead for all cities.

MORNING BRIEFING: FINDING GREEN PASTURES IS MONEY IN THE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he has won only one golf tournament in four years, Arnold Palmer is 
financially sound. According to Golf Digest, Palmer will earn more than $9 
million in endorsements and that makes him the leading money winner off the 
course. He is followed closely by Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus, who will make 
$8 million and $7 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Norman, it is not only the great players who are reaping the 
benefits of golf's popularity. "A good player with flair, personality and the 
ability to communicate with top-level executives can make scillions," Norman 
says. "He doesn't have to be a world-beater, a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hood, an agent for Advantage International, agrees. "If he wants to do 10 
or 15 outings as well (as PGA tournaments), he's guaranteed starting off the 
season in the neighborhood of $200,000 or more." 
</P>
<P>
It must be the money that makes golf so popular. 
</P>
<P>
Smart choice: At the start of the National Football League season, Paul 
Frazier's judgment seemed, um, questionable. With only one full college season 
behind him, the running back for Northwestern Louisiana, a Division I-AA 
school, was academically ineligible for his college team and decided to turn 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
He signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I think of it, he wasn't very smart," said Jim Finks, the Saints' 
general manager. "Here's a kid with another year of college eligibility, 
looking for a job, and he signs with a team that has Dalton Hilliard and Rueben 
Mayes at running back." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier must have known what he was doing, though. Not only did he make the 
Saints' final roster, but last Sunday he carried the ball 12 times for 74 yards 
in the second half of New Orleans' 28-0 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Faster, Mark: If Mark Spitz does return to competitive swimming -- he expects 
to make the Olympic team in the 100-meter butterfly -- he will have to swim 
considerably faster than he did in the 1972 Olympics. Although his winning time 
of 54.37 seconds in Munich would have placed eighth at the Seoul Olympics, it 
would have been only fifth-best at the U.S. Olympic trials, and only the top 
two in each event make the team. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz is the second American swimmer who won a gold medal in 1972 to try a 
comeback in the last several years. Sandy Nielson, who won the 100-meter 
freestyle in Munich, placed seventh at last year's Olympic trials in the 
50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Of the seven gold medals Spitz won in 1972, four were for 
individual events, the 100- and 200-meter freestyles and the butterfly events. 
What other swimmer has won four individual events in one Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
On this date: On Sept. 14, 1968, Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers beat the 
Oakland Athletics, 5-4, becoming the first pitcher to win 30 games since Dizzy 
Dean in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: At the 1988 Olympics, Kristen Otto of East Germany won the 50- 
and 100-meter freestyles, the 100-meter butterfly, and the 100-meter 
backstroke. She was also on winning 400-meter freestyle and medley relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: John Mitchell of the New York Mets, who was called up to fill out 
the roster, comparing himself to teammate Howard Johnson, who has hit 34 home 
runs and stolen 37 bases this season: "I was in the 30-30 club at Tidewater -- 
30 walks and 30 strikeouts."

Sharon A. Bolton has been named partner and vice president of Dartmouth 
Development Co., a newly formed real estate development firm in Del Mar. She 
will be responsible for marketing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Dartmouth two months ago, Bolton was a vice president at Bedford 
Properties, developer of the master-planned community of Rancho California. In 
that position, she was responsible for managing the sales of more than 16,000 
acres, including the Oakridge Ranches project in Rancho California. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton, 45, also spent several years as an outside real estate saleswoman and 
has owned her own Orange County advertising agency with clients including 
Knott's Berry Farm and Lion Country Safari. Her marketing and sales career 
began in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, my background is more one of experience than of a fancy educational 
dossier," she said. "Experience-wise, I started working in 1967, doing 
marketing and planning for Mission Viejo Co., which was just a baby then." 
</P>
<P>
Bolton then went to work at the Irvine Co. as assistant manager of the firm's 
Fashion Island project in Newport Beach before starting her own ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
Always an active community volunteer, Bolton founded PHASE in 1974. She 
developed the nonprofit group, which grew to 2,200 members, to serve the needs 
and utilize the skills of newly divorced and widowed women who had never worked 
outside the home before. 
</P>
<P>
"PHASE's primary purpose was to help women get employment," Bolton said. "I was 
married 12 years before I got divorced, but there were women out there who had 
been married 30 and 40 years who had never done anything besides take care of 
the house and family." 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said that what started as a way for women to market their organizational 
skills rapidly became a major support network that drew national attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We published a magazine and sold memberships to women, and advertised to 
people who found these women were a very specialized market," she said. "It 
took off like wildfire then. I went on television, was in front-page articles, 
and all of a sudden I was a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
Bolton moved to Rancho California nine years ago with her second husband, 
Robert, and their three children. They raise thoroughbred horses on their 
50-acre ranch. CAROLINE LEMKE

Las Vegas as the summer-long impasse between major resorts and striking 
musicians continues. Newton said he bowed out of Tuesday's opening at the Las 
Vegas Hilton to show the people of Las Vegas that "their needs are more 
important" than his. Musicians Local 369 is on strike over the issue of taped 
music and guaranteed work, and both sides said after a negotiating session this 
week that they were at an impasse. No new talks are planned. The latest 
proposal by the resorts to guarantee the jobs of four musicians but to leave 
the hotels free to use taped music was called "unacceptable" by Mark Tully 
Massagli, president of Local 369. "Unless we have some semblance of work 
guarantees so our people can make a living in this business, we're going to 
have a problem getting this resolved," he said. Several performers have honored 
the picket line and refused to perform at Strip resorts, including Dean Martin, 
Rodney Dangerfield, Connie Francis, Burt Bacharach, Dionne Warwick, Bill 
Medley, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Randy Travis and David Copperfield 
performed as scheduled, and Engelbert Humperdinck worked several nights at the 
Las Vegas Hilton, then quit the remainder of his engagement. ALEENE MacMINN

Meredith Vieira, the "West 57th" correspondent who is joining "60 Minutes" 
later this month, won four Emmys as awards for news and documentary programming 
were presented Tuesday night in New York City. Vieira, who focused on 
children's issues to win her first news Emmys, tied with ABC's Tom Jarriel, who 
received four Emmys for his work as a correspondent on ABC's "20/20." "West 
57th" was the big winner among news series, with seven awards from the National 
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. PBS, with 18 awards, won more Emmys 
overall than any of the three commercial networks. CBS took 16, with 8 for ABC 
and 5 for NBC. Emmys for prime-time programming will be handed out Sunday 
evening at the Pasadena Civic, with Fox Broadcasting televising the ceremonies.

An "obsessed fan" was ordered Wednesday to stay at least 200 yards from the 
home of 17-year-old pop star Tiffany. A Superior Court commissioner issued the 
restraining order against Jeff Deane Turner, 35, after Tiffany said she became 
upset and feared for her safety when she learned he had obtained her address. 
Tiffany said Turner kissed her and put his arm round her at a concert. "He has 
sent me numerous letters, one of which says that God wants us to be together," 
she said. In addition to keeping his distance, Turner was ordered not to 
telephone Tiffany, whose full name is Tiffany Darwish, and not to send her 
presents. ALEENE MacMINN

CONSUMPTION OF GROUND BEEF HAS INCREASED THANKS TO SOARING FAST-FOOD SALES. BUT 
THIS NOSTALGIC INGREDIENT FROM THE 1950S ALSO REMAINS A SOURCE OF QUICK, 
NUTRITIOUS AT-HOME MEALS.;

<P>
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HAMBURGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hold it. I thought we were going to talk about food in the New Age. Things like 
hydroponic vegetables, vacuum technology, bio-sensoring, explosion puffing, 
reconstructed egg cubes. Whatever. Then I get an assignment to write something 
about hamburger. Hamburger? Yes. Whatever happened to good old American 
hamburger? That was the question. Well, the prognosis is not good. On the other 
hand, it's not bad, considering how many things one can do with hamburger, how 
far it stretches the food budget, and its nutritional and nostalgic value. What 
family of the '50s did not have a meat loaf cooking in the oven at least once a 
week? According to the American Beef Institute, total ground beef consumption 
has increased from 21.9 pounds per capita in 1970 to 29 pounds in 1987, but it 
is believed that at-home consumption of hamburger has decreased. "We get our 
clue from spending patterns," said Jens Knutson, economist at the American Meat 
Institute in Washington. "Away-from-home spending has increased sixfold, from 
about $25 billion in 1970 to $156 billion in 1988. On the other hand, at-home 
spending has not increased proportionately -- $74 in 1970 to $255 in 1988. 
That's only a threefold increase," he said. "To us that means that 
away-from-home dining out has increased dramatically while home dining has 
decreased." Since 1978, there has been a 12% decrease in home consumption of 
hamburger, according to the Lempert Report, a newsletter specializing in 
marketing analysis, issues and trends. If you think that's bad, hot-dog 
consumption has gone down 17% in the last 10 years. The decrease in total beef 
consumption from 80 pounds per capita in 1970 to 73.4 pounds per person in 1987 
reflects, say health experts, consumer concerns about fat intake. Knutson can 
only speculate as to reasons for the downward trend in home cooking and its 
effect on hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
"A good guess is that with two-income families on the rise, there is little 
time for home cooking and sharpening of home-cooking skills. It's easier for 
people to eat out these days," he said. Does that mean the days when children 
ran into the kitchen following the aroma of cookies baking in the oven and pot 
roast browning on the stove are gone forever? Just about. But there are still 
cooks who find the kitchen a therapeutic place to create nutritious, low-cost 
meals. And hamburger, whosecost per pound has risen from 66 cents in 1970 to 
$1.31 in 1987, still represents an excellent food bargain. A little -- one 
pound -- goes a long way when combined with vegetables or grains. 
</P>
<P>
We dug into the '50s (via our recipe files) to resurrect tried-and-true recipes 
using hamburger, the standard fare of many families in those days. What we 
found -- and had almost forgotten -- was a treasure trove of inexpensive, 
nutritional recipes. Things like hamburger pie, Chinese casserole and Sloppy 
Joe. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger requires no cutting or trimming; it is ready to use and quick to 
cook. There are neither long hours spent over a hot stove, nor elaborate 
concoctions that defeat the purpose of ease and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
If fat is a concern, check the label on packages of hamburger. Generally 
speaking, hamburger made with cube steak, top round or beef tips is lower in 
fat and calories than hamburger made with bottom round, top loin or sirloin. 
</P>
<P>
Ground meat from chuck, brisket or rib steak contains more fat and calories, 
about 209 to 244 calories per three ounces compared to 157 to 204 for the 
lower-fat meats mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fat Percentage Varies 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of fat the meat contains varies, but 3 ounces of lean hamburger 
contain a total of 19 milligrams of fat. (By comparison, chicken with skin 
contains 15 milligrams fat; eggs 12 milligrams, and salmon 6.6 milligrams.) 
</P>
<P>
The cholesterol levels of beef are lower than those for same-size servings of 
pork, roast or fried chicken, veal and dark meat of turkey (about 73 
milligrams, or 24% of the daily level of 300 milligrams recommended by the 
American Heart Assn.). 
</P>
<P>
Our old recipes show that ground beef commonly was sauteed with some fat. 
Addition of fat is no longer recommended when searing or sauteing ground beef 
in a nonstick pan. In addition, draining off excess fat can further reduce 
total fat intake. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, hamburger casseroles were a convenience entree that mothers 
could prepare early in the day and heat up when the troops arrived home for 
dinner. Today, some of those casserole concoctions can be prepared quickly in a 
skillet, because hamburger takes minutes to cook and is easily combined with 
noodles, rice and other grains, or vegetables for a quick, nutritious meal. 
</P>
<P>
Casseroles, such as the tamale casserole given here, were a standby of hosts 
who needed to avoid last-minute work. Other casseroles, such as the Oriental 
concoction, were buffet table favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Chile and tacos are dinner-time favorites even today and can be made at home in 
a flash, with additions such as chopped onions, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce 
and tomatoes to boost their nutritional and taste value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recipe on Package Mix. 
</P>
<P>
The recipe for cheeseburger pie probably originated on the package of pie crust 
mix. Leftover crust found its way to the dinner table with hamburger as a 
filling and cheese slices as a topping. A side of spinach or other vegetables 
rounded out the entree. 
</P>
<P>
Meatballs simmering in a thick tomato sauce ready to spoon over spaghetti -- it 
is as beloved a dish today as it was in the '50s, when the only pasta most of 
us recognized came with meatballs or meat sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Stuffed peppers, too, are an ongoing classic that defy age. The nice thing 
about the dish is that stuffed peppers can be prepared well in advance and 
served at room temperature or hot. Some people, in fact, eat them cold, 
straight from the fridge. It's also a good meal to prepare in quantity and 
store in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Marian Manners Meat Loaf was a favorite of several former Times food 
editors. One such original recipe calls for beef, pork and veal; however, we 
found that using only ground beef was completely satisfying and tasty. The loaf 
usually was served with tomato sauce or gravy. We added a tomato sauce to 
Marian Manners Meat Loaf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sloppy Joe Craze 
</P>
<P>
Sloppy Joes were big time in the '50s. All you had to do was season a pound or 
two of ground beef with catsup, Worcestershire sauce and chile powder. Sloppy 
Joe was also part of the makings for tacos, enchiladas and spaghetti meat sauce 
-- quick, easy, versatile. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite of the time was the Diamond Jim Special, named after Diamond 
Jim Brady, a turn-of-the-century financier who enjoyed consuming food and 
amassing fortunes. The special is a simple yet nutritious concoction of ground 
beef, spinach and eggs. High in protein, the Diamond Jim Special makes a 
splendid dish to serve children who won't eat spinach. In this dish, they will 
hardly know the green, leafy vegetable is present. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury steak could do no wrong when it was king of hamburger -- before the 
advent of fast-food hamburgers. It's really a steak formed from ground beef and 
served with Belmont Sauce, a simplified gravy made with catsup, Worcestershire 
sauce and mustard. Sherry added to the sauce enhances the flavor but is not 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
Noodle-beef casseroles in numerous variations were part of the '50's repertoire 
for many families. They still make a good pantry shelf dish to serve a family 
in a budget or time pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd's Pie is an inheritance from Britain that has graced American tables 
throughout the decades, especially when leftover mashed potatoes were on hand. 
All you do is top sauteed meat seasoned with tomato and gravy with the potatoes 
and voila, a dish fit for family, friends or potluck suppers. 
</P>

GLEANERS' BOUNTY AIDS NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the cool mist of a Camarillo morning, one of the finest examples of 
volunteerism in Ventura County is evident in the work of about a dozen retirees 
laboring at one of the area's many produce farms. 
</P>
<P>
The group, busy harvesting carrots on this particular day, is part of an 
organized effort to reduce food waste by salvaging crops that would otherwise 
be destroyed by growers because of defects or poor market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being plowed under, the fruit and vegetables are, instead, picked 
by Food Share, an area anti-hunger group. The bounty is then distributed 
throughout the county to 160 neighborhood agencies that assist the needy with 
free meals or groceries. 
</P>
<P>
The program, known as "gleaning," is in its 11th year and is believed to be the 
state's oldest. Ventura County's rich and varied agricultural base has helped 
make Food Share's success possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come quite a long way from 1978 when we were operating out of a two-car 
garage," said Jewel Pedi, Food Share's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Pedi now presides over a 12,000-square-foot warehouse operation that also 
handles donations of processed food and government surplus commodities. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have as many as 24,000 area families benefited from the project, but 
produce has also been shipped to food banks as far away as Fresno and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"(Food Share) is very good at helping to provide fresh fruit and vegetables for 
us," said Doris Bloch, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank's executive director. 
"Sometimes they glean more than they can use and they channel it into Los 
Angeles County for the hungry and needy people here . . . They're doing a great 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, about 4 million pounds of otherwise unwanted fresh fruit and 
vegetables are recovered annually from local fields by Food Share. Much of the 
produce has been rejected for cosmetic reasons, such as discoloration or 
bruising. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of product out here," said Al Hall, who 
supervises the gleaning. "It's just a matter of getting it picked, hauled and 
processed. There is plenty of food to feed everyone; it's just a matter of 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's enthusiasm is also evident among the 200 people, mostly retirees, who 
have volunteered to become farm workers for a day, or more, a week. Generally, 
those that participate have little or no experience in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
From Monday through Friday, one or more crews of about a dozen people assemble 
at various locations throughout the county and are directed to a particular 
farm to pick whatever is in season. The crops vary and caninclude produce such 
as kiwi, butter lettuce, red beets, cauliflower or broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six growers participate in the program by allowing the gleaners to work 
their fields when crops are no longer commercially viable to harvest. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the carrots being picked by volunteers were unsaleable as a fresh 
item because of mildew damage -- the green tops had turned gray and yellow 
after an irregular weather pattern of fog and sun. 
</P>
<P>
Although the carrots were still edible and wholesome, their retail value had 
disappeared, according to Tony Ochoa, a field manager for Boscovich Farms, 
which opened the carrot field to Food Share workers. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, the crew dug at the crop rows and pulled out handsome bunches of 
carrots, lopping off the discolored tops and then tossing the vegetables into 
bins. The group works for only a short period in order to prevent fatigue and 
finish before the noonday heat. But in the time allotted for the field, the 
gleaners picked six 500-pound bins of carrots. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the volunteers are motivated to don their old clothes and get their 
hands dirty out of concern for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Fridrich, 68, a retired Navy pilot, said he enjoys the field work and 
knows his efforts are making a difference in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm doing something good for other people. And I also need the 
exercise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Santangelo, 73, has been gleaning since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord gave me two good arms," he said, "so I work hard and pick what I can. 
And I hate to see food go to waste, plus I've become fascinated with it all." 
</P>
<P>
Another advocate is schoolteacher Joyce Lister, 45, the crew's youngest member. 
</P>
<P>
"I love everything about gleaning," she said. "I enjoy helping people and being 
outside. Carrots, though, are a lot of work, but they're also gratifying 
because so many come out of the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Even after a productive morning, only a small portion of the eight-acre plot 
was picked. The field would be plowed under with most of the carrots still in 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to get this food, but its a shame that so much still goes to 
waste," said Frank Craven, 70, a 10-year veteran of the Food Share gleaning 
project. "We'll never get all this done . . . But the farmer can't wait for us 
to finish because he needs to plow the field under and restart with another 
crop." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the same market conditions that allow farmers to donate 
unharvested produce can change quickly and make things interesting for the 
gleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Another volunteer, Reb Varner, recalls a time when the crew was told to stop 
harvesting crookneck squash by a grower because the prices for the yellow 
vegetable had suddenly increased. The gleaners were then directed toward a plot 
of zucchini, which, correspondingly, had dropped in value. 
</P>
<P>
"So, they told us to move over to the zucchini and leave the crookneck squash 
alone," said Varner. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Hall, the supervisor, lamented the pending loss of the carrot acreage. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had more people," he said, "we could pick this entire field." 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in donating time as gleaners or money to fund processing 
operations can write Food Share, P.O. Box 4596, Ventura, Calif. 93004. The 
group's telephone number is (805) 647-3944.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: WRONG MIX OF MEDICATION, FOOD CAN LEAD TO NUTRITIONAL 
DEFICIENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of us try to choose our foods to promote good health. Some of us also take 
medications -- either over-the-counter or prescription -- for the same reason. 
But what happens when the two are at odds? 
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that use of certain drugs can lead to nutritional 
deficiencies. And by the same token, diet can block the effectiveness of some 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense that foods and drugs interact within the body. Yet the chemical 
intricacies of how they do so remain a gray area. Meanwhile, medications on the 
market multiply every year, widening the problem's scope. 
</P>
<P>
Some facts are known about the effect of drugs on nutrition. Digitalis, used in 
the treatment of heart disease, has been found to depress appetite. Many other 
drugs can upset the stomach, causing you to eat less. Over a long period of 
time, such a side effect might result in significant weight loss and depletion 
of nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nutrient Absorption Blocked 
</P>
<P>
Some drugs impair the body's ability to utilize nutrients. One of the first to 
be shown to do so was mineral oil, once commonly used as a laxative. In some 
people it hampers absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K. Laxatives cut down the 
length of time foods stay in the body, reducing the opportunity to absorb the 
nutrients they provide. And some laxatives also can affect the lining of the 
intestine. Likewise, antibiotics alter the intestine, affecting intake of 
glucose, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, carotene and Vitamin 
B-12. 
</P>
<P>
Another group are the antacids containing magnesium or aluminum hydroxide. 
Binding themselves to phosphorus, they make phosphorus hard to absorb. They 
also interfere with absorption of folic acid by making the gastrointestinal 
tract more alkaline. And potassium chloride, which is used to protect potassium 
supplies, raises the acidity of the intestine, reducing uptake of Vitamin B-12. 
</P>
<P>
Other drugs can hasten the destruction of vitamins. Patients on long-term 
anticonvulsant medication may develop a bone disease called osteomalacia, 
possibly because the drug stimulates enzymes that inactivate Vitamin D, which 
is essential to bones. 
</P>
<P>
Still other drugs cause nutrients to be lost through urinary excretion. Taking 
aspirin may increase excretion of Vitamin C. Isoniazin, a drug used to fight 
tuberculosis, binds with Vitamin B-6, which is then excreted by the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
With all the drugs we've been discussing, the extent of the nutritional problem 
caused will depend on the length of time involved, rather than on the dose. In 
other words, occasional use of medications won't jeopardize your nutritional 
status, but long-term use could open the door to nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of the coin is that as drugs can alter nutritional processes, so 
food may affect the action of drugs. If you drink milk when you take the 
antibiotic tetracycline, calcium will block the drug's absorption. Other foods 
affect other medications differently, and the effect is not always negative. 
For instance, anti-fungal medications are absorbed more readily if taken with a 
high-fat meal. And while fruit juices may interfere with absorption of some 
antibiotics, the acid environment they create is helpful when it comes to 
taking iron supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Some foods contain ingredients that counteract the effectiveness of a medicine. 
Foods high in Vitamin K (essential for blood clotting) such as broccoli, beef 
liver, cabbage, asparagus and spinach may inactivate anti-clotting medication. 
And if you're taking the anti-depressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors, you 
should stay away from foods rich in tyramine such as Cheddar cheese, avocado, 
bananas, soy sauce and chicken liver. These foods can bring about serious 
complications. Also, megadoses of Vitamin B-6 work against L-Dopa, used to 
treat Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's a body to do when medications are necessary over the long term? The 
wisest step is to read directions on the bottle or package to find out just 
when (before or after a meal) and how (with water, milk, etc.) any drug should 
be taken. It's also important to consult with your physician about what dietary 
course to follow. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to mixing drugs and food, you should give yourself every chance 
to make the mix both effective and safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Updated Figures Give Eggs Lower Cholesterol Content 
</P>
<P>
Question: Are eggs today lower in cholesterol than they used to be? I heard 
that on the radio and wonder if it's really true. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Updated figures for the cholesterol content of eggs are considerably 
lower than those first published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture more 
than 20 years ago. Indeed, the results of a nationwide study conducted jointly 
by the USDA and the egg industry indicate that the average large egg contains 
213 milligrams of cholesterol, down 22% from earlier estimates of 274 
milligrams. These results are based on analyses of samples representing more 
than 60% of the eggs produced in this country. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason is the availability of superior methods of laboratory analysis, 
making more accurate determinations possible. But there may be real differences 
in the amount of cholesterol in eggs now available. It has been suggested that 
changes in feed and increased production of eggs by hens result in eggs that 
contain less cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
But even at these lower levels, eggs remain the main source of dietary 
cholesterol for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that one out of five adults in this country is overweight? 
</P>
<P>
A: Alas, the figure is higher. The most recent estimates come from data 
obtained by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 32 
states and the District of Columbia in 1987. Conducted by state health 
departments and coordinated by the National Centers for Disease Control, the 
surveillance system's telephone surveys have been providing valuable 
self-reported behavioral and personal-health practices information since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
That survey found the prevalence of overweight to be 21.8% for men and 21.1% 
for women. Prevalence varies considerably by region. It is lowest in the West 
(17%), followed by the Northeast (19.8%), the South (22%) and the Midwest 
(23.1%). 
</P>
<P>
But if anything, these estimates, based as they are on self-reporting, err on 
the side of underestimation. 
</P>
<P>
In the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, where 
individuals were weighed and measured, the prevalence of overweight was 24.2% 
among men and 27.1% among women. Given the increased risk of a number of 
diseases associated with excess weight, even the lower figures are too high. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can honey cause botulism poisoning in infants? 
</P>
<P>
A: Honey has been linked to increased risk of botulism in infants and is 
currently not recommended as a suitable food for babies under 1 year of age, 
and especially not before they are 6 months old. But the occurrence of infant 
botulism cannot be explained by the use of honey alone. In fact, while as many 
as 29% of the affected subjects in early studies had been given honey, in later 
studies that figure had dropped to about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to better understand the infection, which has been diagnosed in 
600 infants since it was first described in 1976, the Center for Infectious 
Diseases of the Centers for Disease Control recently conducted a study of all 
known cases that had occurred over a two-year period in every state but 
California between April 1985 and March 1987. The objective was to identify 
factors common to babies who got botulism but absent from a similar group who 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
Risk factors were found to change with age. For infants less than 2 months old, 
living in a rural area or on a farm was the only consistent factor. For those 2 
months and older, however, the condition was more likely to occur among those 
who were breast-fed, among those who had a history of decreased frequency of 
bowel movements for at least two months, and among those who had been given 
corn syrup, which has occasionally been found to contain low levels of botulism 
spores. The use of honey also remained a factor, although only 11 babies in the 
case studies had consumed it. 
</P>
<P>
These data do not provide a cohesive approach to preventing botulism. The 
report's authors concluded that while avoiding honey does make sense, the 
relationship with corn syrup requires further clarification. And the higher 
prevalence of botulism among breast-fed infants should not be viewed as a 
deterrent to breast-feeding. The reason for the association with breast-feeding 
remains a matter of conjecture. Moreover, botulism is rare, and the benefits of 
breast-feeding far outweigh any possible increase in risk. 
</P>
<P>
Infants who do not have a fever but who show a reduced ability to feed, and in 
whom no other infection can be demonstrated, should have a stool specimen 
submitted for detection of the toxin, especially if there has been a change 
toward less frequent bowel movements.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: HOW TO REDUCE THE INTAKE OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL FOR 
HEALTH'S SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON

<TEXT>
<P>
The influence of cholesterol on American health has been a cornerstone of 
scientific research in recent years. In fact, when the news began to spread 
that the waxy substance was a major risk factor for heart disease, consumers 
responded swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't eat it. 
</P>
<P>
Food manufacturers had similar reactions. They began removing cholesterol from 
as many food items as they possibly could. They promoted those products that 
didn't contain the substance, which was now perceived as "deadly," and touted 
those that could potentially offset or reduce its impact on the body. 
</P>
<P>
As the scientific community watched, consumers ate less and less 
cholesterol-filled foods, but the incidence of heart disease failed to decline. 
In 1986 (the latest year for which statistics are available, according to the 
American Heart Assn.), heart and blood vessel diseases killed as many as 1 
million Americans -- almost as many as cancer, accidents, pneumonia, influenza 
and all other causes of death combined. That same year, about 466,000 Americans 
died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers decided to look for another culprit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Look at the Fats 
</P>
<P>
After scrutiny of clinical and epidemiologic data, they determined that 
saturated fat, which is converted by the body into cholesterol, might instead 
be responsible for the death rate from heart disease. High intake of saturated 
fat was linked to the high levels of cholesterol found in the bloodstreams of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Because the American diet had shifted from foods rich in cholesterol to those 
containing high amounts of saturated fats, such as baked goods, salad dressings 
and fried fast foods, fat -- both of the saturated and unsaturated varieties -- 
became the prominent risk factor for heart disease. Cholesterol in food was off 
the hook -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, researchers continued to study the overall effects of high 
blood cholesterol levels on other diseases. They speculated that -- although 
not quite sure how -- cholesterol might contribute to another deadly American 
affliction -- cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings give consumers another reason to put cholesterol back on 
America's most "un" wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contributors to Tumors 
</P>
<P>
Although both fat and cholesterol have always been suspected as contributors to 
tumor formation in certain forms of cancer, such as colon, breast, prostate and 
endometrium, a Northern California research group has confirmed it. Excessive 
blood cholesterol does indeed have a role in triggering two of the most deadly 
tumors found in U.S. cancer victims -- colorectal and pancreatic, they claim. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent article in the journal Science, geneticists at UC Berkeley 
identified a type of chemical, the ras oncogene, which has a dual, but 
potentially dangerous function: While it is crucial to the formation of 
cholesterol, which the body manufacturers by itself for proper cell 
functioning, it is also necessary for maintaining a gene that triggers tumor 
development in the pancreas, colon and rectum. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of this type tend to support the advice from health organizations, 
which encourages Americans to limit intake of foods that are high in fat and 
cholesterol and to increase intake of those -- such as fiber -- that have a 
protective benefit. 
</P>
<P>
It is a goal that is easily accomplished by replacing high-fat dairy products 
and meats in the daily diet with low-fat and lean varieties, including fish or 
skinless poultry. Substituting fresh fruits and vegetables such as those that 
are rich in vitamins A and C (dark green vegetables, red, yellow and orange 
fruits and vegetables) for baked and fried goods, also may reduce risk, 
according to the National Cancer Institute.

 ABOUT WINE: A VINTNER RIDES THE ROLLER COASTER OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WINDSOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Strong settled back in his chair, looked at the ceiling in his office 
and sighed when the inevitable question was asked about the reincarnation of 
the winery that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of emotional swings in the business of wine," he said, 
somewhat abstractly. "It's all like a game. If you are mature at all, you 
realize what the score is and go forward. If you are immature, you allow your 
personality to take over and that ruins you." 
</P>
<P>
The response was an indication that Rod Strong, 62, a wine maker for three 
decades and one of the first members of the second generation of Sonoma County 
wineries, is content to ride yet another bronc in the rodeo known as the 
corporate winery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth $40 Million 
</P>
<P>
When Rodney Strong Vineyards was sold a year ago to Klein Foods of Stockton in 
a deal estimated to be worth nearly $40 million, it was the latest chapter in a 
story that has so many twists and turns it would confuse Nero Wolfe. The sale 
ended a wrenching two decades of roller-coaster economics that saw the winery 
borrow heavily, grow successful, offer public stock, wind up nearly destitute 
and finally end up on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Strong -- who says "this place was unwanted and unloved for three 
regimes" -- retains his old office up the wrought-iron circular staircase on 
the second floor. And he is pleased that the winery he created is now in 
understanding hands. The wines he pioneered from various regions of Sonoma's 
north county soil remain good values and promise to improve when the new owner 
has time to make his commitment felt. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Strong, a former Folies Bergere dancer and choreographer with a faraway, 
artistic look in his eyes under a wreath of white locks, is on this midsummer 
day not as puckish as he once was. The eyes appear a bit more wary. Perhaps the 
agony of the last few years has left him looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Strong and his wife, Charlotte, got into the wine business in 1960 when they 
opened a tasting room in Tiburon to sell wines bought in Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, Strong and partner Pete Friedman moved to Windsor, north of 
Santa Rosa and 65 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, and developed a 
direct-mail marketing division to sell their wines by mail, through phone 
solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of private financing deals (that leveraged the place a bit), 
Windsor Vineyards opened a new $2-million winery in 1970 and an initial public 
stock offering was completed at $5 a share. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, with the stock at $41 a share, Windsor expanded, and in 1972 a 
second stock offering, at $28.50 per share, was completed. In 1973, Windsor 
became the name of the mail-order part of the business and Sonoma Vineyards 
became the name of the wines marketed to restaurants and retail. 
</P>
<P>
But within two years, an industrywide slump and other complications of business 
left the company $20 million in debt, leading Strong and Friedman to the 
decision in 1976 to sell a major portion of the company to Renfield Importers. 
</P>
<P>
Renfield took over management of the company and Friedman soon left. Renfield, 
which had pumped $4 million into the facility, then began buying up small tool 
companies in a diversification move that eventually fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the name of the winery was changed to Rodney Strong Vineyards. Despite 
record revenues in 1982 of $48 million, and then another record $60.4 million 
in 1983, Sonoma Vineyards' profits were flat. In 1984, the firm announced that 
debt had risen to $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
With the stock then trading for $1.63 per share, Renfield took the company 
private with a $2 per share tender offer. Shortly after, in 1986, Renfield sold 
the company to Schenley Industries of New York. And less than two years later, 
Guinness of Great Britain, the world's largest drinks company, acquired 
Schenley and announced it was getting out of the wine business. Rodney Strong 
Vineyards would be sold again. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Renfield-Schenley-Guinness periods of his life, Strong says: 
"No one wanted to put money into it (the winery) because they weren't in it for 
the long haul." Oak barrels and other equipment needed to make fine wine 
weren't replaced, and marketing suffered. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in the narrative, Strong reached across the table and poured a 
glass of his 1986 Fume Blanc ($8). He pushed it toward me and said, "Here, try 
this. We've got to get off the business pages and back onto the wine pages. 
We're a winery, not a Wall Street chip." 
</P>
<P>
The wine was elegant, with a direct, no-oak melon-and-pepper steeliness and a 
crisp finish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Establishing a Style 
</P>
<P>
"Our '87 will be like this. We like to establish a style for a wine and ride 
that donkey until someone tells us it's lame." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but what was it like being a public company for 15 years? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a stigma attached to being on the financial pages. Public ownership 
is a detriment to a winery's health. You have to be concerned about your 
earnings per share each quarter when you should be making decisions long-term, 
not worrying where you're going to be in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Reporting to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a lot different 
than making wine," said the man who once taught drama at San Francisco State 
University and who remains a consummate after-dinner speaker, filled with 
decades of wine-making memories. 
</P>
<P>
Strong's latest wine releases are about a year older than some other wineries' 
because sales have suffered in recent years. (Shipments were off 10% in 1988, 
according to one estimate.) I liked the 1984 Cabernet Sauvignon from the famed 
Alexander's Crown Vineyard ($13), a fairly rich, dense wine with spice/cedar 
elements and an anise-clove aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
Other wines I liked were the rich, gutsy, amply endowed 1981 Zinfandel "Old 
Vines" from a pre-Prohibition era vineyard ($8), a concentrated, marvelously 
structured 1985 Johannisberg Riesling Late Harvest ($9 half-bottle), and a 
smooth, approachable 1985 Merlot from the River West Vineyard ($12) that would 
be a good choice for restaurants because of early drinkability. 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker for the last few years here has been Rick Sayre, whose name has 
appeared on a number of special-designation wines under the Windsor label. Now 
Strong and Sayre will have a chance to show what they can really do. 
</P>
<P>
New owner Tom Klein, a quarter-century Strong's junior, has spent more than $1 
million in the first phase of refurbishing the winery. Strong says, "He's 
spiffed the old girl up a bit." Included in that touch-up is the addition of 
some $300,000 in new oak barrels in which to age the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think present management is interested in premium wine," Strong said. 
"Premium wine can be profitable because it enhances the asset value of the 
brand. Now, instead of being known as a factory, the philosophy here is smaller 
but better." 
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, Rodney Strong and Windsor were closing in on 500,000 cases 
of production annually. Last year, shipments were just over 400,000 cases, and 
only about 30% was under the Strong label; the rest was Windsor, sold via a 
telephone marketing system. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Strong appears slightly hesitant about getting too enthusiastic about 
his new partners, and one can hardly blame him. Just 18 months ago, after 
Guinness announced it would sell Rodney Strong Vineyards, Strong put together a 
financial group and was an eager bidder for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Klein was another bidder, and for a period of time the two factions were 
financial foes waging a war to win the property. Klein won, and for another 
period of time it was unclear if Klein would retain Strong. "The transition has 
been quite amicable," says Strong. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, in a brief chat at the recent Sonoma County Wine Auction and Showcase, 
said he was pleased with the way things were going, and that major changes 
would regain the fame Sonoma Vineyards once had.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: LUNCH BOXES POWER MIDDAY MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lunch box -- besides being a safe haven for peanut-butter-and-jelly 
sandwiches on the go and being filled with funny (or frustrating) tales from 
mom or its patient packer -- is an object of mystery and suspense: "Did the 
food get eaten, or possibly thrown out?" 
</P>
<P>
For the child, the question is, "Is my meal different from yesterday's?" Or, 
"Will I get a new kit this year?" 
</P>
<P>
Lunch-box styles don't usually undergo drastic metamorphoses. Shapes are 
basically the same, but cosmetic designs do change. In yesteryear's lunch 
boxes, sports activities, cartoon and storybook characters were the popular 
print designs. Oval or rectangular in shape, '30s lunch kits were made of metal 
and looked more like old-fashioned cookie tin boxes with handles that swing 
down to the side. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the character metal lunch kits. Their real glory days were from the 
'50s to the '70s. That's when we saw more of the Lone Ranger, Davy Crockett, 
Batman and Robin, Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and teen idols like the Beatles 
and Bobby Sherman. The selection of personality attractions was endless, enough 
to please baby boomers in their time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Ban on Metal 
</P>
<P>
But gone are the days of these steel boxes, which are now precious collector's 
items. (Rambo, the last version, was pressed in 1987, phasing out the metal 
models more than a decade after a mother brought a lawsuit when her son got 
struck in the head with one; she won the case, resulting in a metal ban in 
Florida.) The lunch box for the baby boomer's school child is now only 
available in lightweight acrylic plastic and choices are few. A sampling 
follows: 
</P>
<P>
Kids won't miss the bus with Lunchtime ($24), the world's first clock lunch 
box. It's not only a time-teaching tool for children, but it helps them with 
their appointments. Introduced by Metrokane, the high-tech lunch box is 
equipped with a battery-operated quartz clock with a large, highly readable 
clock face located on the top cover. 
</P>
<P>
This colorful new bucket is oblong with four attractive color combinations: 
pastel turquoise, pink and purple; primary red, blue and yellow; black and 
white; neon black, red and purple. Inside Lunchtime is a canister-type 
eight-ounce thermos that comes in matching colors. For convenient carrying, the 
box has an adjustable shoulder strap. 
</P>
<P>
When the heat is on, it's nice to have a cold drink from the lunch pail. Thanks 
to the freezer gel or ice block, it's now possible to keep cold foods cold in a 
container for a few hours. Snack &amp; Sip from A. K. Das ($12.99) is one of 
those lunch boxes that comes with this reusable ice block. Designed to fit as 
the lunch-box cover is its one-pint liquid canteen that comes with a cup on its 
top. Rectangular in shape with a short handle, the product is available in a 
combination of hot pink and aqua, red and black, and blue and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Another lunch-box unit from A. K. Das is The Car ($12.99). Reminiscent of the 
VW Bus metal lunch box of 1960, The Car this time looks like a Volkswagen bug 
in eye-catching bold colors of red, yellow or royal blue body and black wheels. 
An impulse buy or a toy, the Car is cute but for lack of inside space, square 
sandwiches may need some reshaping into smaller pieces to fit. The box comes 
with a short thermos-like jug with a cup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Goes Inside 
</P>
<P>
Now that you've pleased your child with his new "toy" tote, the question about 
what's in the box or brown bag (or a pretty paper one) is another challenge. 
The "Penny Whistle Lunch Box Book" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Publishers: 
$9.95) is dedicated to all mothers and fathers (bless their kind souls) who 
take time to make their children's lunches each and every morning. Authors 
Meredith Brokaw and Annie Gilbar have come up with over 100 recipes and 
solutions to packing up an appetizing and tasty child's meal. 
</P>
<P>
Easy to make, the recipes include breads and muffins, cheese/milk and egg 
dishes, fish, fruits, meats, poultry, soups, snack foods and vegetables. Of 
course there's a peanut butter chapter that goes beyond the classic peanut 
butter and jelly filling. The offering consists of granola bars, ladyfingers, 
salads, cookies and even an old-fashioned peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the jovial black-and-white drawings, the fun part of this book are the 
little anecdotes and helpful hints on the side of the pages as well as the 
great tips, including healthful, nutritive suggestions and psychological ones. 
</P>
<P>
They write, for instance, "If your child is like any of ours and has a favorite 
joke book, choose some he loves and copy them on a card. Include the card in 
the lunch box." The authors also feature international menus, a sampling of a 
lunch menu for a month, plus a brief nutritional chart for recipes and 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 The A. K. Das Lunch Boxes are available at May Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lunchtime from Metrokane is available from By Design and Silver Skillet 
(Del Mar).

 BACK TO BASICS: GETTING THAT CAKE DONE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temperature, pan placement and timing are all-important factors when baking 
cakes. Unless you are certain the oven you are using is calibrated correctly, 
use a supplementary oven thermometer. A temperature of 375 degrees is typically 
used when baking shortened cakes. 
</P>
<P>
Place cake pans on the center rack in a preheated oven. They should not touch 
each other and there should be at least one inch between the pans and oven 
walls to allow for even heat circulation (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positioning for Small Ovens 
</P>
<P>
In very small ovens it may be necessary to place the pans on two racks. These 
racks should be placed in the middle third of the oven with enough space in 
between for the cake on the lower rack to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Position the cake pans so they are not directly over each other (Step 2). In 
this configuration, the pans may need to be turned a few times to promote even 
baking. 
</P>
<P>
Begin testing for doneness five minutes before the specified baking time has 
elapsed, or when the lower time of a baking range (such as 25 to 30 minutes) 
has been reached. There are two tests for doneness: 
</P>
<P>
Insert a wood pick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean and dry 
(Step 3) -- with no batter or crumbs clinging to it -- the cake is done. 
</P>
<P>
You may also lightly touch the top of the cake with your finger (Step 4). If 
properly baked, the cake should spring back, leaving no imprint. 
</P>
<P>
Once baked, remove cakes from the oven and cool in the pans on wire racks that 
allow air to circulate underneath. Cakes are ready to be removed from the pans 
when the bottoms feel just warm to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
Run a spatula around the sides of the cake to release it from the pan, then 
invert the cake onto a plate or wire rack covered with a kitchen towel. Peel 
the parchment or wax paper away from the bottom of the layer. 
</P>
<P>
Place another wire rack over the bottom of the cake and invert the rack and 
cake again so that the bottom of the cake is resting on the rack. Let the cake 
cool completely in this position. 
</P>
<P>
Properly prepared shortened cakes should have a fine texture, pleasing flavor 
and good volume. The texture should be uniform, with no "tunneling" through the 
body of the cake. The crust should be gently rounded and, in the case of a 
white or yellow cake, golden brown.

REMOTE AIRCRAFT ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed the city attorney to draft an ordinance that 
would ban the use of remote-control operated model helicopters and airplanes in 
city parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Recreation and Parks Commission at its Aug. 17 meeting said the operation 
of remote-control model aircraft is not compatible with heavy park use. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Franklin-Moran, director of cultural and recreation services, said the 
city has received numerous complaints about the noisy and potentially dangerous 
model aircraft. She said the city will try to find another place for hobbyists 
to fly their aircraft.

NEW SCHOOLS BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Board of Education on Tuesday approved a $28.3-million budget 
for the 1989-90 school year, about $389,000 more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, which will not affect property taxes, will leave reserves of about 
$1.3 million. The largest expenditures include $18.9 million for salaries, 
including $14.9 million for teachers, $4.4 million for fringe benefits, $2 
million for utilities and operating expenses, and $1 million for books and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the district's revenue comes from the state. About $5.7 million comes 
from local sources, including $4.6 million from the city of Beverly Hills and 
income from oil wells at Beverly Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
The budget is based on current salaries, although the district has not 
completed salary negotiations for the year. Each 1% of salary increase will 
cost nearly $200,000, said Don Fox, assistant superintendent for financial and 
business services. If increases are negotiated, the district will have to use 
reserves or cut other expenditures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the teachers union are using a state mediator after they 
failed to agree on wages and benefits for the third year of a three-year 
contract. The district is offering to increase the teachers' 1989-90 salary 
3.05% and to continue the contract another year with a 5% increase for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Education Assn. is proposing an 11% raise for 1989-90, or a 
20% increase over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, custodians, administrators and other employees get the same 
percentage salary increase that teachers get, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
The next mediation session has been scheduled for Sept. 21.

PREFERENCES IN STREET SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking over samples of street signs in their chambers, City Council members 
expressed their preferences Tuesday about a purchase that is expected to cost 
$160,000. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds frowned at what she called the "post-modern" look 
of one sign, die-cut to echo a motif of the new City Hall complex. "This isn't 
where we want to spend our money," she said. "What we're after is readability. 
And it will look dated after a few years." 
</P>
<P>
But while Reynolds said she wanted a simpler design, she also said that instead 
of the palm tree that graced another model, she would prefer the city seal 
under an arch that would fit over the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bernard J. Hecht said he preferred the die-cut City Hall motif. 
Mayor Max Salter favored dropping "street" and "avenue" designations in favor 
of larger lettering and a clear indication of the block number. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor instructed Environmental Services Director Mark Scott to prepare two 
new samples that would incorporate the council members' preferences. In an 
interview after Tuesday's study session, Scott said the city's art director had 
worked on the signs. No outside designers had been consulted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they had not decided when to install the new street signs.

LUCKY ELDERLY MARK BIRTHDAY OF SUBSIDIZED APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Casa de la Paloma became Glendale's first subsidized housing 
project. The nine-story apartment complex, with its manicured front lawn, red 
facade and colorful interiors, opened its doors Aug. 20, 1979, to about 200 
low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the original residents were on hand Monday to celebrate the birthday 
and show off their home -- some of the most sought-after living quarters in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just one of the lucky ones," said Blanche Combs, 87, who moved into the 
building when it opened. Casa de la Paloma on Kenwood Street is the largest of 
the two federally subsidized apartment buildings in the city, where senior 
citizens accounted for 22% of the population in the last census. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Income 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Presbyterian Homes developed the 167-unit apartment complex 
and operates it under a contract with the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. Tenants are required to contribute 30% of their income toward 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Glendale senior citizens, most of them on fixed incomes, have been 
on waiting lists for subsidized housing units for years. Glendale Community 
Development Director Madlyn Blake estimated that there are 4,000 elderly 
Glendale residents living below the poverty level. There are more than 2,000 
names on the waiting list for Casa de la Paloma and the 97-unit Park Paseo, the 
other federally subsidized complex, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Gee, 86, another 10-year Casa de la Paloma resident, said she applied 
for subsidized housing in 1972. A Glendale resident since 1927, Gee said she 
had to leave her former apartment because "the rent was going up so much." 
</P>
<P>
Casa de la Paloma has hardly put a dent in the needs of the low-income elderly 
in Glendale, but to the select group living there, it has made a world of 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gather for Party 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of residents, friends and relatives gathered for the anniversary party 
in a reception area brightened by orange walls and by sunlight pouring from 
windows. They talked about everything from weekend bingo to their health and 
the going wages for part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A white linen tablecloth covered the long serving table. Dorothy Nelson, 84, 
served tea from a silver urn. Ann Mitchelltree, 68, ladled fruit punch out of 
an ornate glass bowl. A tray of pound cake and a cup of peanuts complemented 
the refreshments. The paper napkins were inscribed, "Casa de la Paloma, 10th 
Anniversary," with a big number 10 taking up most of the printed surface. 
</P>
<P>
For Sadie Howard, 88, the party was a homecoming. Confined to a wheelchair and 
no longer able to care for herself without help, she had to move out of Casa de 
la Paloma and into a retirement home in April. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so nice to be back," she said. "I have loads of friends here." 
</P>
<P>
In one corner, the Royal Vista Terrace "gang," as they call themselves -- a 
group of residents from a nearby non-subsidized senior citizen housing complex 
-- admired the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"This building is so big," said Betta Hart, 70, who was visiting for the first 
time. "It has so much to offer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The proud hosts, all sporting "Casa de la Paloma charter member" silk badges, 
could hardly stop smiling as the visitors reminded them of their good luck.

CENTER HELPS EASE ISOLATION OF ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
FACILITY FOR ASIAN PATIENTS SUFFERS FROM FRAIL FINANCIAL HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When 74-year-old Lily Wong came to the Central Adult Day Health Care Center 
near Echo Park Lake in November, she could barely walk. 
</P>
<P>
Crippled by Parkinson's disease, she spent much of her time confined to her 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
The disease had atrophied her muscles, and her psychological health had 
deteriorated as well. 
</P>
<P>
"She literally dragged herself into our center," recalled nursing assistant 
Grace Ho. Social worker Zvi Galibof, himself an emigrant from Israel, said: 
"She said to me, 'What is the use of making efforts to walk when I will come 
nowhere with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
But since her first visit to the center nearly a year ago, Wong has learned to 
cope with the degeneration that comes with Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
She is now able to walk with assistance, and she has hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, I ask God to take me away," she said, her voice barely 
audible above the din of the lunchtime gathering at the center. "They're very 
kind to me here." 
</P>
<P>
Wong is one of about 30 seniors who regularly attend the center. The 
state-licensed facility, which is in the recreation hall of St. Athanasius 
Episcopal Church, provides bilingual nursing services, occupational and 
physical therapy, exercise classes and nutrition counseling to its largely 
Asian clientele. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Illnesses 
</P>
<P>
Many of the center's patients suffer from various illnesses associated with 
aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, 
post-stroke conditions and cardiac complications. 
</P>
<P>
The center uses group activities to counter the sense of isolation felt by many 
seniors. "The socialization process is one of the most beneficial," Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate this philosophy, a large sign across one wall reads: "Friends are 
good medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Tsou, the center's founder and administrator, said she started the center 
to help the many elderly, non-English-speaking people who came to Los Angeles 
from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't getting appropriate treatment," Tsou said. "They couldn't 
communicate with the nurses and doctors. Gestures don't interpret what you 
really want or need." 
</P>
<P>
But despite its success with patients, the center's financial health is as 
frail as that of many of its patients. 
</P>
<P>
The center was opened in August, 1987, with a $50,000 grant from the state 
Department of Aging and funds from private foundations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the center has struggled to survive on an annual budget of 
$140,000. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the funding comes from medical reimbursements, $45.85 per patient per 
day, from the state Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
Tsou said 30 people must attend the center every day, double the present 
average daily attendance, to make it self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
She estimated that the center receives $110,000 a year in services and supplies 
donated by French Hospital, which is in Los Angeles' Chinatown; the Los Angeles 
County Food Bank, which provides food for the daily lunches, and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Ailments 
</P>
<P>
To add to its financial ailments, the center may have to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
The center's site is slated for demolition within the next two years when the 
Los Angeles Episcopal Church begins work on its new diocesan center. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the demolition, the church changed the center's year-to-year 
lease to month-to-month in December. 
</P>
<P>
Father John Bruno, rector of St. Athanasius, said he has reminded Tsou several 
times about the new lease terms and the possibility that the building housing 
the center could be demolished as early as next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have time to look for another place," Tsou said. "I looked at 30 
places before I found this one. It's hard for me to think of looking all over 
again."

ROOS UNABLE TO PULL BACK BILL EXTENDING CONSERVANCY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) attempted this week to retrieve a bill 
from Gov. George Deukmejian's desk that would extend the life of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual maneuver was blocked, however, by a parliamentary technicality. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would extend the operation of the conservancy, which buys parkland in 
the Santa Monicas, until 1995. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal, a Westside Democrat, received final legislative approval last week. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, who had voted for the bill, won Assembly approval Monday to withdraw it 
from the governor's desk. But later in the day the Assembly's chief clerk, 
Brian Kidney, said the withdrawal was void because the legislation originated 
in the Senate and any retrieval effort would have to begin there. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Tuesday, Roos said the staff of the Assembly Ways and Means 
subcommittee on bonded indebtedness, which he chairs, had voiced concern that 
the conservancy was acquiring land encumbered by bonded indebtedness that the 
state could be obligated to repay. Roos said his staff is reviewing whether the 
state has become saddled with any major costs as a result of the conservancy 
accepting gifts of parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy supporters voiced fears that the legislation may face trouble with 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the agency has 
not acquired property with debts.

CARS GET GREEN LIGHT ON 3RD ST. AFTER 25 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vehicular traffic has not been allowed on 3rd Street between Broadway and 
Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica for nearly 25 years. But after a two-year, 
$10-million conversion of the aging Third Street Mall into the upscale Third 
Street Promenade, the City Council has opened the street to cars -- albeit 
grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly two hours of discussion Tuesday night, the City Council decided 
that vehicular traffic would be allowed daily except between 10 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m. and between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Wednesdays. The Farmers Market is held 
on Wednesdays at Arizona Avenue and 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Hours for vehicle traffic will be extended between Thanksgiving and New Year's 
Day, with the ban applying from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily, except Wednesdays when 
the 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. ban will remain. 
</P>
<P>
The promenade officially opens Saturday with a celebration from noon to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the hours that vehicles will be allowed on the new tree- and 
topiary dinosaur-lined Third Street Promenade varied from merchants asking for 
as short a ban as possible to an elderly resident calling for as lengthy a ban 
as possible because of concern for children and elderly residents walking 
around the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William H. Jennings sided with merchants who argued that they needed 
visibility provided by extended vehicular traffic, but Jennings was the lone 
vote against the daily 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ban. Councilman David Finkel was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed argued for a longer ban, but her motion to extend 
the daily ban to 6 p.m. failed on a 3-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Debate then centered on weekend hours and the potential conflict between 
automobiles and pedestrians, particularly with 17 movie theater screens 
scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to delay any action until after all screens open at the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane, a major force behind the mall's renovation, pushed for the 
shorter ban during the holidays. The motion passed on a 5-1 vote, with Reed 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
With the matter of vehicular traffic resolved, Zane asked about bicycle 
traffic. The council quickly agreed to make that question part of the staff's 
analysis of the movie theater impact in January.

HONORING MACK SENNETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two errors, one typographical and the other technical, in Esther 
Schrader's story on the preservation of the remaining stage of the original 
Mack Sennett Studios. The article states that Sennett built stages on the site 
in 1916, but the location hasn't been used as a studio since Sennett left in 
1916. In fact, the Sennett Studios moved from the site in 1928 to the Studio 
City location that later became Republic Studios and is now CBS/MTM. 
</P>
<P>
More annoyingly, Schrader refers to the building as a sound stage. As a film 
historian specializing in technological aspects, I've found no reference to any 
experimentation with sound on the West Coast prior to 1927, so this could 
hardly be a sound stage. And, in fact, the first sound stage on the West Coast 
was built by Warner Bros. in the spring of 1927 for the sound scenes in "The 
Jazz Singer" at their old studios on Sunset Boulevard, now KTLA, where the 
stage reportedly still stands. It would be a year, after the success of that 
film, that serious interest in sound developed at various studios, with the 
earliest to start building stages being the two in the vanguard of sound films, 
Warner and the Fox Film Corp. at its then-new West Los Angeles studio, which it 
temporarily named "Movietone City" after its sound process and where the stages 
it built are still in use by 20th Century-Fox and its various tenants.

LEGISLATURE ON VERGE OF APPROVING BILL TO LIMIT PIPELINE FEE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A major pipeline company appears close to winning legislative passage of a bill 
that would significantly change the way cities levy fees for underground rights 
of way, a revision that some larger cities say would cost them millions of 
dollars in future revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sought by Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, was approved in a 5-1 vote 
Tuesday by a joint legislative conference committee. Assemblywoman Gwen Moore 
(D-Los Angeles) cast the only no vote. The legislation by state Sen. Newton R. 
Russell (R-Glendale) goes to the Assembly and state Senate for final action. 
</P>
<P>
Under two 42-year-old laws, smaller, general-law cities are limited in the 
amount of fees they can levy for pipelines used by more than one oil company, 
those known as common carrier pipelines. But the laws do not place limits on 
fees charged by 83 state-chartered cities, including such large municipalities 
as Los Angeles, Long Beach, Santa Ana and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Freeze Rates 
</P>
<P>
Russell's legislation would freeze the rates levied by charter cities, while 
allowing a small increase for some general-law cities. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Arnold, lobbyist for Long Beach, termed the proposal "a giant windfall" 
for the pipeline companies. "They are going to save literally millions of 
dollars over the next 25 years," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Russell acknowledged that some cities would eventually receive less revenue. 
But he said the aim of his bill is to ensure that one city does not hold up a 
pipeline company for "an exorbitant fee." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's bill was triggered by a Long Beach ordinance, approved after a 1980 
pipeline accident and fire, that boosted the fees charged common carriers, 
including Southern Pacific Pipe Lines, which is under Santa Fe ownership. 
Southern Pacific challenged the ordinance, but an appellate court last year 
ruled that state law does not preempt Long Beach and other charter cities from 
determining their own rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbied to Revise Law 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe then lobbied to revise the law, citing the specter of cities 
continually upping their rates. Long Beach charges Santa Fe $58,000 a year for 
nearly seven miles of right of way under city streets and gets another $70,000 
annually for another common carrier pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise hammered out in the six-member conference committee, the 
rate that Los Angeles charges Santa Fe, for example, would be frozen at about 
$14,000 a year. Ron Kagel, a lobbyist for the city, said the city has been 
seeking to negotiate a new franchise rate of about $28,000 a year. Kagel said 
the city opposes the Russell bill because "it's an incursion into the home rule 
of the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
But Russell said he is "just trying to balance the interests" of cities with 
the state's need to ensure that petroleum products are delivered efficiently. 
He said if the companies cannot build pipelines, the oil will be shipped by 
tanker trucks, exacerbating congestion and air pollution.

FAST CLIMB FROM 'FUNKY' TO 'UPSCALE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can an area go from "funky" to "upscale" without any breathing spell in 
between? 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I (and eventually our two kids) have had a Silver Lake home with a 
lake view for 26 years. We have always been committed to living in the city. In 
the beginning, one acquaintance dismissed Silver Lake "as an area where a 
fairly decent house can be right next to one that is a dump." It was only about 
a year ago that one of our more affluent friends called us "eccentric" for 
living here. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, they are right. Silver Lake bears little resemblance to the wealthy 
suburbs. We are far more racially and ethnically diversified. There always has 
been a far greater "live and let live" attitude as there is a wide range of 
financial and social classes. The counterculture came here early and left later 
than most (in fact there are still remnants here). 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, we take umbrage when we are characterized by editorialists as 
"upscale" people who are so crass that we are only thinking of our wallets by 
making the aesthetic argument against the Department of Water and Power to 
protect our reservoirs. It really bites when DWP-inspired character assassins 
claim we want people in South-Central Los Angeles to pay more so that we can 
maintain our pristine views. 
</P>
<P>
That is really a bum rap because probably no other area in Southern California 
has lived with and fought harder for better race relations than Silver Lake. 
And all of us, regardless of color or ethnicity, love the view. 
</P>
<P>
FLOYD A. OLIVER, Silver Lake 
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the Sacramento Bee characterized Silver Lake as an area of 
"wealthy landowners" whose aesthetics were endangering "the poor people, 
literally and figuratively, who live down below."

SOVIET JEWS STUDY THEIR LOST RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he chanted in Hebrew, Arthur Pinchev dipped a burning blue and white braided 
candle into a silver wine goblet. The flame was extinguished and the nearly 50 
Soviet Jews encircling him were left in momentary darkness. 
</P>
<P>
It was a traditional Habdalah, the Jewish ritual marking the end of Shabbat and 
the beginning of a new week. 
</P>
<P>
The lights came up, illuminating the bright, excited faces of the participants 
-- recent immigrants ranging in age from 5 to 75 who had been unable to 
practice their religion until they left the Soviet Union. They had come from 
throughout Southern California to the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in Simi Valley 
for a three-day retreat to study the basic traditions of Judaism. Few had ever 
witnessed a Habdalah. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a mystery, I have never experienced anything like this before," 
Tamara Korotkina, 59, said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
Korotkina immigrated to the United States from Leningrad less than two months 
ago to join her daughter and son-in-law, who came to this country last year. 
Her eyes glowed as she affirmed that she will continue to practice the ritual 
and learn more about her religion when she returns to her new home in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sketchy Knowledge 
</P>
<P>
Most Jews in the Soviet Union have only a sketchy knowledge of the values, 
beliefs and practices of their religion because, until recently, the Communist 
government has prohibited them from studying Judaism. With this in mind, the 
Los Angeles Jewish Federation Council's Bureau of Jewish Education invites 
recent immigrants to weekend retreats such as the one at Brandeis-Bardin to 
help educate them about their religion. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Soviet Jews have a negative Jewish identity. Their Jewishness has been 
defined for them by anti-Semitism," said Rabbi Victor Rashkovsky, who was born 
in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in 1973. "They have had 
negative things brought to their lives because of their Jewishness, but they 
have no positive Jewish identity -- nothing to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Rashkovsky, who became a rabbi 10 years after arriving in the United States, 
came from Tennessee to lead discussions and services in Russian for recent 
immigrants, most of whom came to this country in the last two years as a result 
of a turnabout in Soviet immigration policy. Many of the new arrivals have an 
intense desire to explore their religion. 
</P>
<P>
No rabbis have been ordained in the Soviet Union since the Bolsheviks closed 
the rabbinical schools during the 1917 revolution, so Soviet Jews only learn 
what family members pass down, Rashkovsky said. Therefore, many have only a 
minimal knowledge of the history and heritage of their people when they leave 
the Soviet Union, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them didn't know anything about Jewish tradition. For them, being 
Jewish was something ethnic, an identification with the past, present and 
future of the Jewish people," Rashkovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
During the retreat, which began with Sabbath services and concluded Sunday 
morning with brunch, the recently arrived Soviet Jews experienced a traditional 
Shabbat weekend, with services, Hebrew songs and Israeli folk dancing, led by 
Pinchev, the program director of Brandeis-Bardin. They had open discussions 
about being Jewish in American society and asked questions they might be 
embarrassed to ask an American-born rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easier for them to talk to me because they know I would never laugh at 
them, no matter how basic their questions. I know where they are coming from 
because I share their unfortunate background," Rashkovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
While growing up in the Soviet Union, Rashkovsky said he never practiced Jewish 
rituals. He read a little ancient Jewish history and he knew about Israel, but 
that was the extent of his knowledge about his religion and its beliefs. Still, 
he said, he was denied a place as a full-time university student because he was 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Sofia Kashper, 64, a participant in this weekend's program, grew up in 
Leningrad. She recalled that she could never escape feeling that she was "a 
second person -- not number one" because she was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you forget it? On every document, on every paper, it is written that 
you are Jewish," Kashper said. "It is a shame." 
</P>
<P>
She said she knew virtually nothing about her religion. Until she married a 
Jewish man from the Ukraine, she said, she had never heard of Yom Kippur, the 
most sacred Jewish holiday, when Jews fast and pray for forgiveness for all 
their sins. 
</P>
<P>
Kashper was as a professor in a music conservatory across the street from the 
old Leningrad synagogue, which she said she never dared enter. "I knew if I go 
to the temple I would be fired," she said in English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chased Out of Synagogue 
</P>
<P>
Others at the weekend retreat told similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Rubinstein, who immigrated from Kiev just over a year ago with his wife, 
Marina, and their 5-year-old son, said he was once chased out of the Kiev 
synagogue after he brought in some American tourists who had stopped him and 
asked for directions. 
</P>
<P>
"The director asked me who I was, and I told him I was Russian," Rubinstein 
said. "He told me to get out and said I couldn't be there. The Americans didn't 
know what was happening." He said he believes that most people who work in 
synagogues are informants for the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein and his wife said they are thrilled to have the opportunity to 
freely practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting. I want to learn more. I have a son who is 5 years old and 
I want to give him a Jewish education. I want him to know more than me and my 
husband and my parents," Marina Rubinstein said.

HARVARD AT BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its opener, Beverly Hills showed little defense against Lompoc and none 
against tailback Napoleon Kaufman, who led the Braves to a 45-24 rout of the 
Normans. Kaufman scored four touchdowns, including one on a 95-yard kickoff 
return and another on a 73-yard interception. He rushed for more than 140 yards 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard lost in its debut, to Blair, 10-8, but the Saracens received a standout 
performance from junior defensive back-wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke , who 
was born in Nigeria. Uwaezuoke, who presents difficulties not only to opponents 
but also to game announcers, was particularly effective on defense, making 10 
solo tackles, forcing a fumble and knocking down a pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Normans will play host to the Saracens at 3 p.m. Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
The outlook for the remainder of the summer surface action is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
On the local scene, some barracuda and bonito at rocky point and the rigs are 
mixed together with yellowtail. Only the sand bass catches have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro and Long Beach sportfishing fleets on multiday trips have been 
chasing albacore and tuna, trolling 150 miles out with success. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned early Tuesday morning 
with 72 albacore, 46 skipjack and one dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot fish and one of the biggest dorado brought into a South Bay landing 
this year was caught by Barry Beh of Long Beach, who said the fish jumped out 
of the water several times and after 25 minutes was decked with help from the 
crew. It weighed in at 52 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Beh is having it stuffed for his trophy room. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's El Dorado multiday trip resulted in 175 albacore. Al 
Modefsoto of Inglewood caught the jackpot fish when he weighed in a yellowfin 
tuna at 57 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club was the winner of the eighth annual Marlin 
Tournament, outpointing the Marina City Anglers. 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs caught a total of four marlin. The King Harbor club released more 
and earned the most points. 
</P>
<P>
John Whitaker of the King Harbor club was the top angler, with one marlin on 
12-pound test line brought to the boat in 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Top boat among the 27 competing was the Genesis, skippered by Robert Goldstein 
of the Marine City club. The Genesis took two fish, released one and weighed in 
one at Avalon at 181 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Vorgitch of Venice recently returned from Cabo San Lucas. While fishing 
aboard the Mad Dog, he boated the largest marlin caught at Cabo this season, a 
385-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Tom McKindely of Redondo Beach, fishing at rocky point aboard the Redondo 
Special, caught the whopper of the week with a 31-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Powell of Carson, fishing at the rigs aboard the Victory using a jig with 
20-pound test line, pulled a yellowtail from the platform. It weighed 28 1/4 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Alan McFetridge of Torrance, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Blackjack, 
won the jackpot with a 26-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lucas of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the rigs, 
caught a 21-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Amechin of Westchester, fishing aboard the Sportking at Rocky Point, 
caught a 16-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Coil of Torrance, fishing aboard the Isle of Redondo barge, caught a 
16-pound yellowtail.

NO. 5 PEPPERDINE WATER POLO SQUAD WILL FACE TOUGH TEAMS IN TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pepperdine water polo team is ranked fifth in the nation this week by 
college coaches. UCLA is sixth. Only one goal separated them in Pepperdine's 
John Wasko Tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (2-0) defeated the Bruins, 14-13, in overtime in the tournament's 
championship game. Pepperdine also routed Navy, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine will compete this weekend in the 10-team UC Irvine Tournament. The 
Waves will open against No. 4 Cal State Long Beach, defending Big West 
Conference champion, at 1 p.m. Friday. On Saturday, Pepperdine will meet No. 2 
California at 9:20 a.m. and No. 7 USC at 7:50 p.m. The Bruins are also in the 
tournament. Senior Sasa Poljak scored 10 goals, and sophomore Geoffrey Clark 
added eight to lead Pepperdine in the two matches. Wave sophomore goalkeeper 
Wells Guthrie had 25 saves, including 13 against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 5 UCLA men's soccer team (4-0) will play host to St. Mary's at 2 p.m. 
Sunday at the North Soccer Field. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, junior Dana Keir scored three goals, all in the second half, to lead 
the Bruins to a 7-0 romp over UC Irvine. Keir, who has moved from fullback to 
forward because of injuries to Bill Thompson and Mark Sharp, is becoming as 
good on offense as he was on defense. He leads UCLA in scoring with four goals. 
In two previous seasons, he had just two goals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sigi Schmid said Keir's assets as a defender -- "being good in the air, 
his aggressiveness and his strength -- make him a good forward." 
</P>
<P>
The shutout against Irvine was goalie Anton Nistl's 28th of his career. The 
school record of 30 was set by former All-American Tim Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bruins who did well against the Anteaters included freshman Chris 
Henderson with three assists and sophomore Cobi Jones with a goal and an 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's volleyball team (3-1), ranked third nationally, will compete 
in the Mid-America tournament this weekend in Chicago and play its first home 
match next week. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, the Bruins will face No. 17 Penn State on Friday and either No. 8 
Texas or No. 5 Illinois on Saturday. UCLA will play host to the Soviet Union's 
junior national team at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the John Wooden Center. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's Hawaii Tournament, the Bruins defeated No. 18 Colorado State in 
three games and Texas in four, but lost to No. 1 Hawaii in four. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin middle blockers Elaine Youngs , a sophomore, and Daiva Tomkus, a senior, 
were named to the all-tournament team. Youngs had 50 kills, 22 digs, three 
blocks and two service aces, and Tomkus had 25 kills, 24 digs, 22 blocks and 
six aces. UCLA freshman middle blocker Natalie Williams had 30 kills and 16 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's volleyball team, 2-3 as the week began, will compete in 
the Colorado-Coors Invitational this weekend at Boulder. The Waves will open 
Friday evening against Indiana. Other tournament teams are Colorado and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
At home last week, the Waves defeated San Diego State in five games. At the 
Pacific-Reebok Invitational at Stockton, Pepperdine beat No. 15 Washington in 
five games, but lost in four games to No. 7 Pacific and in three to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Tami Seidenberg leads the Waves with 69 kills, sophomore 
outside hitter Cari Delson has 61, and freshman middle blocker Debbie Merandi, 
51. Merandi tops the team with a .325 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team, a 33-3 winner over Chaffey on the road 
in its opener, has a bye this weekend. The Corsairs will play host to Harbor at 
7:30 p.m. Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
SMC rolled up 359 yards total offense and held Chaffey to 92 yards. Corsair 
sophomore linebacker Adonias Lucero was named defensive player of the game; he 
was in on 22 tackles, including four solos, and recovered a fumble that set up 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs used two quarterbacks, freshman Jeff Barrett and sophomore Ernie 
Soto. Barrett completed seven of 16 passes for 103 yards and one touchdown, and 
Soto was four for eight for 52 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Moore had three pass receptions for 73 yards, and threw a touchdown pass 
to Charles McKinzie off a fake field goal. Turhon O'Bannon had five catches for 
61 yards and two touchdowns. McKinzie and Phillip Frazier led the ground game. 
McKinzie had 16 carries for 76 yards and Frazier rushed eight times for 60 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's golf team will open the season Sunday through Tuesday in the 
Brigham Young Invitational at Provo, Utah. Returning Bruins include senior 
All-American Jean Zedlitz, 24th in the NCAA tournament last season, and 
sophomore Christy Erb, who tied for 32nd place. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's cross-country team, which won last week's Cal State Fullerton 
Invitational, will compete in the Aztec Invitational on Saturday at San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who had 49 points to 56 for second-place Arizona, had three runners 
in the top five.

HERSHISER GETS RUN, BUT ASTROS GET 3-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orel Hershiser finally got a run Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But that was it. One run. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Dodgers failed to support Hershiser, as their feeble offense 
sputtered in a 3-1 loss to the Houston Astros before 21,715 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser (14-13) has lost four in a row and is winless in his last six starts. 
The Dodgers have scored only 15 runs in his 13 losses. The Dodgers went 34 
innings without scoring for Hershiser before ending the streak in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Is Hershiser frustrated? 
</P>
<P>
As he said after his last outing: "It would be much more frustrating for me if 
we were in a pennant race. I hope I'm pitching long enough to see another 
streak like this, because they can't happen too often. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a whole lot to say about it. You guys (reporters) will have to 
make it up. I'm having a bad year after getting a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be some interesting interviews in spring training (about 
his performance) next year. I may walk away from a few interviews if guys don't 
do their research." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said: "I can't explain what's going on with 
Hershiser. But he keeps us in every game." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who gave up six hits and struck out five, deserved a better fate. He 
hasn't won since Aug. 8, when the Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves, 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers, who came back to beat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-4, with two runs 
in the ninth Tuesday, failed to score after the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Astro starter Mark Portugal gave up three hits in seven innings. After giving 
up consecutive singles to Mike Marshall and Jeff Hamilton in the second and a 
single to Hershiser in the third, Portugal didn't allow another hit before 
leaving in the eighth for a pinch- hitter. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 graduate of Norwalk High School, Portugal was starting his first game in 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty exciting to pitch here," Portugal said. "I remember sitting in 
the pavilion and catching a Joe Morgan home run in 1972." 
</P>
<P>
Portugal was sent to the minors last June after his earned-run average 
ballooned to 8.53. After being recalled July 15, the right-hander is 5-0 with a 
2.63 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than his first stint, he's been our most consistent starter," Astro 
Manager Art Howe said. "The bottom line is he was throwing strikes and he 
deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Danny Darwin retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth before giving 
up a one-out double to Hamilton in the ninth. But he got Lenny Harris to fly to 
center and struck out John Shelby to earn his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros took a 1-0 lead when Ken Caminiti hit Hershiser's second pitch of 
the second inning into the right-field pavilion. Hershiser settled down, 
retiring the next 12 batters, striking out four. But the Dodgers couldn't get 
him a run, stranding three runners in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally scored in the fifth, a milestone of sorts for Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who singled in the third, helped end the streak when he bunted down 
the third base line to advance runners on first and second. Alfredo Griffin 
drove in the run when he grounded out to second. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Portugal retired the next six batters before he was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros took a two-run lead in the eighth when Craig Biggio had an RBI 
double down the right-field line. After Hershiser walked pinch-hitter Harry 
Spilman, Eric Yelding came in to run for Spilman. Terry Puhl sacrificed Spilman 
to second, and he scored on Biggio's double. The Astros added another run when 
Gerald Young singled home Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scott (19-8) will try to become the first 20-game winner in the National 
League this season when he faces John Wetteland (4-7) in the series finale at 1 
today. Scott is 4-2 against the Dodgers this season. . . . Astro third baseman 
Ken Caminiti, who homered in the second inning, has a 10-game hitting streak, 
the longest of his career. . . . Craig Reynolds was a last-minute replacement 
for second baseman Bill Doran, sidelined with a sore neck. Dodger catcher Rick 
Dempsey turned 40 Wednesday. The Dodgers have had six other players who have 
been 40 or older in club history: Vic Davalillo, Manny Mota, Pee Wee Reese, Don 
Sutton, Hoyt Wilhelm and Maury Wills. Wilhelm was the oldest at 48. . . . Astro 
right fielder Glenn Wilson left after aggravating his left hamstring in the 
seventh.

AT LAST, LADY LUCK SMILES ON DRAG RACE

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halfway through Wednesday's $372,100 Del Mar Futurity, Drag Race was in trouble 
again. 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing new for the dark brown gelding, whose recent races had been 
marked by one disaster after another. His trainer, Steve Miyadi, was up in the 
stands, thinking to himself, "Oh no. Not again." 
</P>
<P>
"I had run out of excuses," said Miyadi, who was 0 for 12 at the beginning of 
Del Mar's closing day. "No one was going to believe me anymore about this 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Drag Race proved good enough to overcome even his own bad 
luck. With Futurity longshot specialist Frank Olivares in the saddle, Drag Race 
ran down the tenacious filly Rue de Palm to win the one-mile event by 2 1/2 
lengths at odds of 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rue de Palm held on for second, a neck ahead of the fast-closing Single Dawn, 
who had enough trouble of his own to keep jockey Alex Solis up nights for a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But if any horse deserved a break, it was Drag Race. The Kentucky-bred son of 
Darby Creek Road had run in five races before the Futurity, winning once for a 
$50,000 claiming price and running in the money in three stakes, most recently 
a second in the Aug. 23 Balboa Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
In each of those stakes placings, fraught with traffic problems, Miyadi became 
more and more convinced that not only did he have a very nice young horse, he 
was also the only one left who believed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just me and Frankie kept the faith," said Miyadi, a former assistant to Mike 
Mitchell. "I had people asking, 'Where you running him next? For $50,000?' I'd 
tell them I was pointing for the Futurity and they'd just look at me." 
</P>
<P>
Drag Race and seven other Futurity entrants were supplemented at a late fee of 
$10,000, making its total purse the largest ever offered at Del Mar. With 12 
running, the winner stood to earn $241,600. 
</P>
<P>
Although the race appeared wide open, fans went for the Wayne Lukas-trained 
entry of Rue de Palm, Sanford Stakes winner Bite the Bullet and the 
$1.25-million Nevada, sending them off at 4-5. Jack Kent Cooke's Single Dawn, 
making only the third start of his career, was second choice at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Graduation Stakes winner Chime Song broke quickly from his No. 11 post and led 
the field into the first turn. Rue de Palm cruised along in second, getting a 
trip reminiscent of her impressive score in the Sept. 3 Del Mar Debutante. 
After a quarter of a mile, Drag Race had only two horses beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares began his move on the backstretch, but he found himself behind a wall 
of horses at the half-mile marker. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I wanted to do was drive him up in there and then get stopped 
again," said Olivares, who won the 1977 Futurity aboard the 71-1 shot Go West 
Young Man. 
</P>
<P>
"So I just eased him back a little and went around," the jockey went on. "He 
never broke stride." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it looked a lot worse to Miyadi. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, Frank made the right move," he said. "But my first reaction was, 
'Well, maybe everyone will see his trouble today.' " 
</P>
<P>
Olivares let Single Dawn sweep past on the outside and then followed the tall 
chestnut into the final turn. With three furlongs remaining, Drag Race took off 
and swung around Single Dawn, setting his sights on the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As Drag Race rambled past, Single Dawn was stopped cold by retreating horses 
who had been burned out on the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to go between horses and was shut off," Solis said. "He's such a big 
horse, it took him a sixteenth of a mile to get in gear again." 
</P>
<P>
Single Dawn did well to make it close for second, but he was no threat to Drag 
Race. 
</P>
<P>
"I get on this horse in the mornings when he works," Olivares said of the 
winner. "He's always shown me a lot. It was just a matter of finally getting 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Drag Race paid $28.80, $7.40 and $5.20. The Lukas entry returned $2.80 and 
$2.40, and Single Dawn paid $3.40. Drag Race ran the mile in 1:35 2/5, the same 
as Music Merci's clocking last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the underbidder on Music Merci," noted Miyadi, who purchased Drag Race 
at California's 2-year-old sale in March for $21,000. "Of course, people don't 
usually believe you when you say that." 
</P>
<P>
Miyadi bought Drag Race for Kazumasa Yano, a Japanese bloodstock agent and 
thoroughbred farm manager. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my kind of owner," Miyadi said. "First he let me buy this horse, then he 
let me geld him the next day. We weren't after a stallion for that kind of 
money. We wanted a racehorse." 
</P>
<P>
They got one, but it took awhile for Drag Race's luck to catch up with his 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally wrapped up his second Del Mar training title early Wednesday when 
Flippable won the third race. McAnally edged Wayne Lukas and Charlie 
Whittingham with a total of 17 wins. . . . The percentage leaders of the 
meeting were Bill Spawr (11 for 43) and Dave Hofmans (8 for 30), both at 26%. . 
. . Eddie Delahoussaye won two races closing day to win his first Del Mar 
title, 44-42, edging Laffit Pincay. . . . On the Line, winner of two stakes, 
was voted horse of the meeting. . . . Survive won the $60,750 June Darling 
Stakes, the closing-day supporting feature. . . . Jack Wood, who has been Chris 
McCarron's valet for the last 10 years, has polished his last boot. Wood 
retired at the end of the Del Mar meet, but he will stay active by training a 
few horses. . . . Also retiring was color man Frank Smothers, who has kept 
thousands of racing silks straight for the past 20 years. Smothers' most 
cherished souvenir is the cap Bill Shoemaker wore when he broke John Longden's 
record for most winners in 1970. . . . Del Mar became the first meeting of the 
inter-track betting era to post an increase in on-site attendance, up almost 3% 
over 1987 figures. Overall handle was up 9% at $7.3 million a day.

HANAUER IS SHOOTING FOR EIGHTH STRAIGHT WIN IN GOLD CUP BOAT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When you check the records, you find that no driver has been able to win 
consecutive Indy 500s since Al Unser did it in 1970 and '71. And that he and 
A.J. Foyt are the leaders with four victories each. 
</P>
<P>
You learn that until Curtis Strange did it the last two years, no golfer had 
been able to repeat as U.S. Open winner since Ben Hogan in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of puts in perspective one of the outstanding records in motorsports, 
or almost any sport. 
</P>
<P>
When Chip Hanauer, 35, a hydroplane racer from Seattle, straps himself into his 
turbine-powered Miss Circus Circus this weekend on San Diego's Mission Bay, he 
will be going for his eighth straight victory in the American Power Boat 
Assn.'s Gold Cup race, the most prestigious event in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Even I find it incredible when I think about it," Hanauer says. "When I first 
started, my only goal was to win one Gold Cup. I never dreamed I could win more 
than one." 
</P>
<P>
But since 1982, nobody else has been in the Gold Cup winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have won the race just about every way possible," Hanauer said. "I 
won when I have outdriven everybody, I've won when my crew has given me an 
unbeatable piece of equipment, and I've won when I have been just plain lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer said, though, that if he is to extend his string this weekend, he will 
need a lot working in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
First there is the course, the 2.5-mile saltwater Bill Muncey Memorial Course 
named after the seven-time national champion from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the fastest course we race on, and I am certain we'll see a 160-m.p.h. 
qualifying lap this weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Miss Budweiser is capable of it. (Driver) Tom D'Eath holds the 
course record at 156.169. If we can get our boat dialed in, we also should be 
able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
And getting dialed in is the key to whether he can win No. 8 he says. 
</P>
<P>
The boat he'll be driving this weekend is one that he crashed at Syracuse, 
N.Y., earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"After debating, we decided that we would rebuild it," he said. "We had to cut 
the back end off aft of the sponson and add a new piece. All of this took time 
and when we first tested it, it just wasn't the same as before. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to tell you how I will do now, I just don't know. If we can get it 
balanced the way it should be, it will be fine. If not, it might be a long 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
If not having his boat set up the way he wants it isn't enough, there are also 
the saltwater problems that have plagued the turbine powered boats. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we have it solved and maybe we don't," Hanauer said. "It worked perfect 
earlier in the year at Miami, but when we tested our saltwater setup last week, 
it was nothing but troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"We and the other turbine boats are gaining on it and it's just a matter of 
time before we perfect the system to keep the salt out of the engines. Last 
year here, nothing went right and I didn't even complete a lap, so you never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer's boat wasn't the only turbine plagued by the salt in 1988. In fact, 
all of them failed, and George Wood in the piston-powered boat Oh Boy! Oberto 
won the event here. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hanauer is far ahead in the driver standings, he trails Miss Budweiser 
in the overall point battle, with the Gold Cup and a race at Las Vegas next 
week left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer, who has two victories this year, believes he could be much closer. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost two races that I finished first, once by jumping the guy and the other 
for hitting a buoy," he said. "And then, there was the blow over at Syracuse. 
In that one, I was leading and I guess I just pushed it a little too hard, a 
gust of wind got me and away I went." 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer was saved by a device that he believes has saved the sport of 
hydroplane racing -- the protective cockpit capsules that are now required on 
every boat. Instead of unprotected drivers being thrown from flipping boats, 
the capsules are thrown. 
</P>
<P>
"It saved me this year," Hanauer said. "And it has saved 10 to 12 other 
drivers, and we are still learning about driver safety through the capsules. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they didn't come soon enough or we wouldn't have lost Bill Muncey 
and Dean Chenoweth, but I seriously doubt that the sport would have survived 
without (the capsules)." 
</P>
<P>
Two drivers in last year's San Diego race, John Prevost and Ron Snyder, escaped 
injury when their boats flipped simultaneously in a heat. Another driver, Scott 
Pierce in Mr. Pringles, has gone over four times in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been in big trouble without the capsule," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Chuck Gurney of Livermore, Calif., who is having one of his 
biggest years, will try to add a victory in the CRA/Parnelli Jones sprint car 
series Saturday night at Ascot Park. Gurney, who wrapped up his second United 
States Auto Club dirt-track series with a Labor Day win at Du Quoin, Ill., is 
coming off a second to Lealand McSpadden in last Saturday night's Ascot event. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Gurney won the biggest annual open-competition midget 
event, the Bellville Nationals at Bellville, Kan., beating many of the same 
drivers he defeated last Thanksgiving Night at Ascot in the annual Grand Prix 
midget event. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to continue this Saturday night is the seesaw battle for second 
place between Ron Shuman and Rip Williams of Yorba Linda. Williams took over 
the spot with a fourth-place finish. Point leader Jerry Meyer, who was driving 
with splint on the finger he injured in a crash at Phoenix, finished sixth 
after having the fastest qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Saugus Speedway holds it annual Fan Appreciation Night Saturday 
when the NASCAR sportsman and street stocks compete. There also will be an 
officials' race and the final ego challenge of the season. . . . Marcus Mallet 
continues his late-season challenge of point leader Jerry Meyer in Sunday 
night's NASCAR Winston racing series at Ascot. Also racing Sunday night will be 
bomber and mini stocks plus bombers on the Figure 8 course. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Press of Frazier Park, who record his record seventh NASCAR Southwest Tour 
win last Saturday at Ascot, headlines the field when the Tour moves to Northern 
California's Roseville Saturday night with a 100-lap event on tap. Ed Hogge, a 
35-year-old Salinas driver, is the 1989 Pacific Coast Region winner in the 
NASCAR Winston Racing Series and will collect $22,500 for his 15 wins and 3,550 
points out of a possible 3,600. 
</P>
<P>
Street and mini-stocks compete Friday evening at Ventura Raceway. . . . Dave 
Scheidecker, the season-long point leader at Orange Show Speedway in San 
Bernardino who thought he lost his bid with an early exit last Saturday, became 
the champion anyway when winner Dennis Woolridge was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Scott Parker set two goals for himself this year -- to win 10 
dirt-track races and the Camel Pro championship. He will try to take a step 
closer to each Sunday when he continues his battle with Harley-Davidson 
teammate Chris Carr on the San Jose mile track. Seven of Parker's eight 
victories have been on mile tracks and after San Jose, the American 
Motorcyclist Assn. series moves to Ascot Park on Sept. 30 and winds up Oct. 7 
at Sacramento. Starting Sunday's event, Parker has a 32-point edge on Carr and 
a win would tied him with Bubba Shoebert, who set the record for most wins in a 
season with nine. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lawson of Ontario needs only to finish 11th or better in Sunday's final 
500cc grand prix at Goiania, Brazil, to wrap up his second consecutive World 
Championship. Starting the event, Lawson has a 15.5-point lead over fellow 
Californian Wayne Rainey of Norwalk in his bid for his fourth world title in 
seven years. A win also would make him the winningest American 500cc rider ever 
with 30 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Schwartz and Phil Collins, the top two riders in the recently completed 
set of qualifying races for the U.S. Speedway Nationals at Costa Mesa, will 
continue their season battle at South Bay Speedway tonight. Racing is also 
scheduled at Costa Mesa on Friday night and at Victorville on Saturday night. . 
. . The Continental Motosports Club holds its weekly races Friday night at 
Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- When the midgets and three-quarter midgets of the United States Auto 
Club compete Saturday for the fourth time this season at Ventura Raceway, they 
will find things bigger and faster. The track has been enlarged to a 
quarter-mile oval. Robby Flock, fresh from a win last Sunday night at Ascot 
after a final-lap tangle eliminated Terry Farrar and P.J. Jones, has a 
two-point lead over Sleepy Tripp in their battle for the Jolly Rancher Western 
States championship. In the TQ race, Kara Hendrick will try close in on leader 
Gary Howard in her bid to become the first women ever to win a USAC 
championship. She is currently 42 points behind. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The NHRA Pacific Division of the Winston Series will hold the 
fifth of six 1989 championship meets in which sportsman drivers can earn points 
toward divisional championships this weekend at L.A. County Raceway in 
Littlerock. More than 350 cars are expected to compete in eight divisions. 
Qualifying is scheduled on Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. with 
the eliminations beginning at noon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
SUPER-MODIFIEDS -- The fastest oval-track racing machines on the West Coast 
will compete Saturday night when Cajon Speedway holds a rare open-wheel show on 
the three-eighths-mile paved oval. Joining the Super Modified Racing Assn. cars 
Saturday night will be the American City Racing League full-bodied sports 
racers. Track record holder Ken Nichols, last year's race winner Mike Swanson 
and Davey Hamilton are expected to headline the super entries. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- Roger Mears, who has had to take a back seat to Robby Gordon, Ivan 
Stewart and Walker Evans, will try for his first stadium truck racing victory 
since 1987 when Round 8 of the 10-race Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix is 
held Saturday night at Mile High Stadium in Denver.

UPDATE ON MAQUILADORAS; 
</P>
<P>
WORRIES OVER LABOR APPEAR TO HAVE SUBSIDED IN TIJUANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL Ascolani's SECOFI office recently presented awards for special 
recognition to several companies that operate Tijuana maquiladoras. Among those 
cited are: * Mattel, for maintaining Tijuana's largest maquiladora payroll. 
Mattel employ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shock waves caused by the labor strife in maquiladora operations in Reynosa 
in northeast Mexico rippled across the Tijuana maquiladora scene over the 
summer, striking fear in the hearts of local boosters who have long touted 
Tijuana's relative absence of labor unions as one of the region's principal 
selling points. 
</P>
<P>
But the ripples apparently subsided, judging from the continued strength in 
applications for maquiladora permits from U.S. and other foreign manufacturers. 
New permits are running nearly as strong as last year, when maquiladoras in 
Tijuana, Tecate and Ensenada increased a record 45% to 579 plants at year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Ascolani, the local delegate in the federal Secretary of Commerce and 
Finance (SECOFI) office in Tijuana, which is in charge of granting maquiladora 
permits, said his office has averaged 11 new permits a month so far this year, 
not to mention 15 ampliaciones, or expansions, per month. Total maquiladoras in 
the Tijuana region now are pushing 700. Employees total 64,000 in the three 
cities, up from 53,000 at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ascolani said the strongest current demand for permits is coming from U.S. 
woodworking companies, from furniture manufacturers to picture-frame makers, 
who now number 110 plants, or more than 15% of all maquiladoras in the Northern 
Baja California region. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of the year so far, from Ascolani's point of view, was 
the opening in August of a maquiladora by Scripto Tokai, Japanese manufacturer 
of pens and disposable lighters. The plant, which employs 400, is the largest 
new maquiladora to have set up shop this year. Payroll is growing rapidly and 
is scheduled to cover 1,200 workers by December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Scripto Tokai plant's work force, which has appeared virtually overnight, 
illustrates that labor is still abundant in Tijuana, Ascolani said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Reynosa grew out of a power struggle among the labor leaders 
there and had nothing to do with Baja California," he said. "Tijuana is quiet, 
and there is a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some American companies are not taking any chances. One Palm Springs 
insurance company that writes policies for U.S. companies to insure them 
against production losses at maquiladoras, reported a significant increase in 
new policies in the aftermath of the Reynosa strikes. CHRIS KRAUL Ascolani's 
SECOFI office recently presented awards for special recognition to several 
companies that operate Tijuana maquiladoras. Among those cited are: * Mattel, 
for maintaining Tijuana's largest maquiladora payroll. Mattel employs 3,600 
during its peak toy-making season in the weeks before Christmas, and 2,800 
during the balance of the year. * Sanyo, the Japanese consumer electronics 
giant, for making the largest capital investment in a Tijuana maquiladora. 
Sanyo has invested $300 million, Ascolani said, in half a dozen plants in 
Tijuana totaling more than 1.5 million square feet of manufacturing space. 
Sanyo assembles a variety of products there, from electric fans and 
refrigerators to televisions and blenders. * Kyocera, a semiconductor 
ceramic-wafer manufacturer, for technology innovations in new chips. * Solar 
Turbines, a maker of oil-field turbine engines, for technology transfer, or the 
maquiladora whose technology most benefits Mexican technological development. * 
Ocean Designs, a furniture manufacturer, for administrative efficiency. 
Turnover at the Ocean Design plant is the lowest among Tijuana maquiladoras, 
Ascolani said.

Baker Frank Fornaca Jr. is one of many people who think of the aroma of baking 
bread as one of life's simple pleasures. But, when government air-quality 
control officials in December branded the smell a pollutant, Fornaca knew that 
tough times were ahead for the baking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, pending regulations would force Fornaca and other bakers to retrofit 
their ovens so as to curb baking emissions. That's a costly requirement for all 
bakers, but especially for smaller independent operations, said Fornaca, vice 
president and general manager of Fornaca Family Bakery -- San Diego county's 
largest independent, family-owned and operated bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"Our retrofitting costs could be as much as $2 million," said Fornaca, citing 
another reason why being an independent baker is not easy these days. 
</P>
<P>
The emission-control ruling is just one of many problems confronting the 
independent baker. Others include the high cost of equipment, fierce 
competition, consolidation and a younger generation's aversion to long baker's 
hours, problems that have led to a steady shrinking of the independent bakers' 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Number Fell 
</P>
<P>
From 1935 to 1980, for example, the number of independent U. S. bakers 
plummeted from 10,000 to 1,000, industry officials say. Now only about 600 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a time when bread baking doesn't appear to be a good way to make dough, 
the Fornaca Family Bakery is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1912 by Italian immigrant Mario Fornaca, the bakery is now under 
the reign of a third generation of Fornacas. Still based at the National City 
bakery where Mario, Frank Jr.'s grandfather, delivered bread by horse and 
buggy, Fornaca now has about 100 distributors that take its products to 
customers as far north as Santa Barbara and east to El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery has endured a shortage of workers during World War II, as well as 
during the Depression, and adapted to a changing environment to preserve a 
family business. Instead of competing head-to-head with plentiful and powerful 
white-bread bakers, such as Wonder Bread, Fornaca succeeded by carving a niche 
in a crowded marketplace. It won loyal customers by baking specialty and 
mixed-grain breads. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been successful because we haven't tried to force-feed white bread," 
Fornaca said. 
</P>
<P>
But not all bakers recognized the changing marketplace, industry experts say. 
Nor were they willing to experiment with new products. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who do it (bake white bread) and they're all 
competing for a fairly fixed market," said Bill Lockhart, a spokesman for the 
American Institute of Baking. The Manhattan, Kan.-based organization runs 
seminars about industry issues, operates a baking school, conducts nutrition 
research and inspects bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of rising equipment and ingredient costs plus thin profit 
margins has persuaded many independent bakers to sell their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"To compete against Wonder Bread, you've got to buy the speedier, more rapid 
baking equipment," said Robert Pyle, president of the Independent Bakers Assn., 
a national trade association based in Washington. "Such production lines are 
very expensive, which means you have to put money back in to the bakery. Not 
everyone is willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baking Is Hard Work 
</P>
<P>
But, more often than not, economic factors aren't the principal ones behind the 
death of a family bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"Baking bread is hard work," Pyle said. "The younger generation doesn't want to 
get up at 3 a.m. to run the bakery. They would rather be at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
But the Fornacas say they were destined to bake bread and are striving to 
maintain a family tradition. In fact, Fornaca has rejected several suitors who 
have offered to buy the bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're good at what we do," Fornaca said. "Besides, this is all we know how to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Mario Fornaca immigrated to Los Angeles from Italy via Ellis Island in 1907. 
After learning the baker's trade, he moved to San Diego to start his own shop 
five years later. Mario turned over the company to his two sons, Frank and 
Felice, in 1952. Back then, the bakery had 25 employees and turned out about 
540 loaves each day. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the family bakery has 235 workers and bakes about 100,000 loaves daily, 
including such well known brands as Bohemian Hearth, Holsum Grain, Deli Breads 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Fornaca bakery produces more than 1 million pounds of bread each week. 
Fornaca revenues are expected to reach $30 million in 1989, a 10% increase from 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Fornaca Bakery has undergone impressive growth in the past, new 
obstacles such as oven-emission controls, threaten its success. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 20, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in San Francisco is 
expected to pass a regulation that will require bakeries that produce more than 
100,000 pounds of bread daily to install "after-burners" in existing ovens to 
reduce the ethanol emitted into the air. The regulation will also require new 
ovens to be equipped with such devices. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethanol (a baking by-product) is a volatile organic compound that is a 
precursor to the formation of ozone," a pollutant that the local air quality 
boards are charged with lowering, said Lucia Libretti, a spokeswoman for the 
San Francisco region's air-pollution-control district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targeting Bakeries 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area is the first, and so far, only district in the nation targeting 
bakeries in efforts to lower pollution. But the baking industry is watching 
events there closely because it fears that other districts will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District and the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District -- which oversees Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- have listed the installation of 
oven-emission controls as objectives in their pollution control plans. 
</P>
<P>
But Fornaca maintains that the amount of ethanol put out by bakers is so small 
that it seems almost ridiculous to go after it. 
</P>
<P>
"Installing after-burners on any new ovens that we construct is one thing, but 
asking us to go back and retrofit all the old ones is asking a little too 
much," Fornaca said. According to air quality officials, it would cost $400,000 
to install after-burners in existing ovens. Building new ovens equipped with 
such controls would cost $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem concerns bakers' delivery trucks. The Los Angeles City Council 
is considering a law restricting delivery trucks on freeways during rush hours 
to reduce congestion. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is 
considering a similar curb on a regional basis in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Such restrictions could disrupt and complicate delivery of baked goods to 
customers, Fornaca said. Nevertheless, he is confident the family bakery will 
find ways to overcome these problems. After running a successful business for 
77 years, Fornaca has reason to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Rocket Science 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about rocket science here," Fornaca said. "Bread baking is a 
basic business. As long as we do the basics right, provide a good product and 
good service, we're going to do all right." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Fornaca bakery only produced French and Italian breads. But, when 
Mario Fornaca's two sons inherited the business in the 1950s, they diversified 
the product line. They introduced Hillbilly bread, a light wheat bread 
considered unique at a time when grocers' shelves were stocked almost 
completely with white bread. The introduction of other brands followed, 
including Bohemian Hearth, Holsum Grain, Deli Breads, Italiano and Poulsbo, 
which is a bread made from sunflower seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bakery does most of its business with major restaurants and 
supermarkets, Fornaca also owns seven thrift stores (small bakery shops). Five 
of the outlets are in San Diego County, one in El Centro and the other in 
Riverside County. The Fornaca bakery also sells to chains such as Price Club 
and supplies Camp Pendleton.

ART BUCHWALD: ADDING NEW WRINKLES IN MEN'S FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the things I enjoy most in the fall is looking at the men's fashion 
supplements in the magazines and newspapers. I study them faithfully in the 
hope that I can find out what I should be wearing in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
I must admit that I am puzzled about what the supplements show. A jacket looks 
as if it's falling off the model's shoulders, the pants are tumbling down to 
his knees, the shirt is wrinkled, and the sleeves are so long you can't see the 
man's fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Every suit looks as if it was just unpacked from a duffel bag, as does the 
person who is wearing it. Page after page is filled with men whose overcoats 
hang down to their ankles and whose hats fall over their ears. In most cases, 
there is a jazzy girl in the picture hanging on for dear life to the man's 
scarf. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't an outfit in the supplements that anyone would buy. So, I ask 
myself, who purchases these creative works of tailoring? 
</P>
<P>
To get the answer, I went to see Gerry of Georgetown, a hot haberdasher, who is 
a fifth cousin to Louis of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerry, I just looked through this fancy men's magazine and it seems to feature 
clothing for the homeless. Who buys this stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
Gerry said, "Nobody. It's aimed at kids on trust funds who hang out in 
discotheques all night long because their parents are divorced." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would they produce clothes like this if no one buys them?" 
</P>
<P>
Gerry took me into a fitting room and whispered, "They don't manufacture those 
kind of clothes. They're not idiots." 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't make the clothes, why do they advertise them?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because they need something new to display. People are not going to be 
attracted to an ad showing ordinary clothes like the ones they wear to work. In 
real life, every man's suit looks like every other man's suit. So, they make up 
one of each of these KGB monstrosities and they put them in the supplement. If 
anyone calls to inquire about one, they hang up on him." 
</P>
<P>
"How do they get that rumpled, washed-out, down-and-out look in the sports 
jackets?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about the rest of the menswear tycoons, but I have a friend who 
throws his clothes onto the New Jersey Turnpike and lets the 18-wheel 
tractor-trailers do his pressing for him." 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder they look so great in the ads." 
</P>
<P>
"My friend is a trend-setter in the men's fashion business. He was the first 
one to develop a necktie that looked as if the person wearing it was hanging 
himself with a noose." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the manufacturers ever advertise anything in a supplement that a man can 
actually wear?" 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen it. You have to get it out of your head that just because you 
see men's clothing in a magazine doesn't mean it has anything to do with what 
you are expected to put on this winter. If you attempted to wear any of that 
stuff, you'd lose your arms in the sleeves, trip over your baggy pants and kill 
yourself with your belt buckle." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that you explained it to me, otherwise I would have thought I was 
weird." 
</P>
<P>
"If you try on one of those corduroy, double-breasted, off-the-collar, 
silhouette suits -- then you'll know what weird really is."

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: LOCAL HISTORIES MAY HAVE THE ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Today's genealogists are ignoring valuable sources to their research problems 
-- local histories, geography and migration patterns of ethnic groups. Without 
this knowledge of places in which your families once lived, you will never be a 
successful genealogist. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers often complain that they can find nothing about an ancestor who was 
born in 1750 Lincoln County, N.C. Well, no wonder. Lincoln County did not exist 
in 1750. It was created out of Tryon County in 1778. By studying the county 
divisions of North Carolina one learns that what eventually became Lincoln 
County was part of Anson County in 1760, which in turn was created in 1750 from 
Bladen County. The records the researcher needs will be in Colonial North 
Carolina sources and filed under Anson and Bladen counties. 
</P>
<P>
Each region, each state and each county has its own history, and in order to 
locate records of genealogical interest you need to study a locale's history: 
its political divisions, migration patterns, early settlers, religious and 
ethnic groups, and its economic development and industries. Since the average 
family (prior to the Civil War) moved about six times during their adulthood, 
you will learn a lot about several locales. 
</P>
<P>
Local histories -- histories of states, counties and localities -- often 
contain a great amount of genealogical information; unfortunately they are 
seldom footnoted and vary greatly in quality. In many local histories you will 
find eulogies of families, often filled with errors, especially in respect to 
early generations of lines. 
</P>
<P>
However, local histories published prior to 1885 are generally fairly accurate 
for the family history of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary periods, for 
they are based for the most part on statements made by members of the family 
who had knowledge of the persons and events of the periods. However, every 
family has its "Uncle Harry" and "Aunt Hester" who never told the same story 
twice; and if they were the source for the information in a particular book, 
you may find glaring discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
Most university libraries contain extensive collections of U.S., county and 
state histories. Public (and some private) universities and colleges are open 
to researchers -- after all, as a taxpayer you support the public ones. Just 
because you are over 25 does not mean you can't go back to school and use the 
library. Many of them are open on weekends -- ideal for genealogists who work 
Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Discover the five-volume set, "A Bibliography to United States Local Histories 
in the Library of Congress." The history, reference and/or genealogy 
departments of larger libraries (especially university libraries) will have 
this outstanding reference set. Therein you will discover what books have been 
written about the areas in which you are interested -- the author's name, date 
of publication and enough description to enable you to determine if it is worth 
tracking down a copy of it. Unfortunately local histories in the Library of 
Congress do not circulate, but if you discover a reference to an 1867 Orange 
County, N. Y., history of the Minisink region that interests you; you'll be 
armed with the exact information needed to locate the book in other libraries. 
Of if you are going to the Washington, D.C., area, then you'll want to stop at 
the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of local histories (and genealogies) available for purchase is 
found by consulting "Genealogical &amp; Local History Books in Print," edited 
by Netti Schriener-Yantis. It is available ($37.50 postpaid) from GBIP, 6818 
Lois Drive, Springfield, VA. 22150.

TRAVELING THROUGH MILES OF DEAD AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ordinary Time by A. G. Mojtabai (Doubleday: $17.95; 223 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
A.G. Mojtabai evokes the travel-death of a cross-country bus ride with the 
tormented precision of a dentist's drill. She writes of a mother enduring the 
cicada-like demands of a restless child; of an old man declaring at a rest 
stop: "I step off the bus and my feet are tired already." We feel the thousands 
miles of dead air, the stopped time, the heat rising off the Texas hardpan. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her new novel, "Ordinary Time," Mojtabai's writing is instilled with 
a disciplined passion to get things right. It is a humane as well as an 
aesthetic virtue; it is a sign of intelligent love, just as a splendidly 
ordered house might be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Without Guarantees 
</P>
<P>
But a splendidly ordered house is no guarantee of life within. In "Ordinary 
Time" the immaculate and often inspired quality of the writing does not quite 
make up for the lack of those brutal transactions that even the most refined 
novels require -- think of Henry James -- in order to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary Time" portrays with entire integrity two heroic characters; both of 
them, as the title indicates, heroes of the ordinary. They live in a decaying 
Texas town where no one is on the streets after 5 o'clock, and where the 
downtown stores display perpetual closing-sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
The town's name is Durance, which means imprisonment, of course; but which also 
suggests the long endurance of Father Gilvary, the Catholic priest in a 
Bible-belt town; and of Henrietta, the aging, blowzy proprietor of the Three 
Square Meals, universally known, because of its location, as Henrietta's 
Cemetery Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosaic Martyrdom 
</P>
<P>
Father Gilvary resolutely bears his prosaic martyrdom. He tried being a 
missionary in India, but his stomach was weak; and so he finds himself visiting 
a dying Catholic or two in the local hospital, calling upon a few housebound 
widows, and struggling with the finances of a parish church that will 
undoubtedly close once he retires. He is a St. Sebastian of the trivial; the 
arrows are roof-repair bills, parish committee chit-chat, and a breezy, 
company-man of a Vicar General. The only thing that keeps his church afloat, he 
reflects with patient irony, are the town's Baptists. Not allowed to gamble in 
their own church, they flock to his bingo evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Henrietta is an endurer of another kind. She was "Miss Rattlesnake 1948"; now 
she is 57, keeps four floppy dolls on her bed to talk to, laments her dead 
husband, entertains an elderly lover who mostly wants to rest, and waits "for 
someone or something to walk into her life." Her morning toilette, with 
mascara, rouge and false eyelashes, resembles an urban renewal project. "All 
lit up," a customer tells himself, watching her preside over her cafe. "Looks 
like one of those painting by the numbers jobs." 
</P>
<P>
She seems silly but she isn't. Her work gives her dignity; the Cemetery 
Restaurant is run with fierce devotion. Her hopes are few and perhaps pathetic, 
but she sustains and abandons them with equal dignity. She, like Father 
Gilvary, is faithful to what she has chosen. Ordinary time, aside from its 
usual meaning, also refers to that long stretch in the Catholic liturgical 
calendar when there are no major feasts. It is Henrietta's and the priest's 
time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks of the Ordinary 
</P>
<P>
There are several kinds of risk in setting your subject upon the ordinary, even 
if your point is the heroism to be found in it. One is that the reader will be 
bored. To Mojtabai's priest and cafe-owner, time often seems to stand still; 
"Ordinary Time" often seems to do so as well, and perhaps all the more because 
of the clear honesty with which it is written. 
</P>
<P>
A novel of stasis can be redeemed by unforgettable characters. The two endurers 
in the book are appealing and sometimes moving, but they are rather crowded. We 
feel sympathy for them, but it would be greater if the author hadn't placed 
them so perilously close to other literary models. Father Gilvary is a cross 
between a J. F. Powers priest and a Bernanos cure; he lacks the combativeness 
of the former and the profundity of the latter. Henrietta, for all her doughty 
appeal and individual touches, is too close to other valiantly raddled literary 
beauties to seem quite fresh to us. Mojtabai treads the edge of imitation with 
grace and precarious originality, but she treads too close and sometimes falls 
in. 
</P>
<P>
There are two modest elements of action in the book. One is the arrival in town 
of Val, a loner with a blanked-out past. He has lost a job, a woman, a life; 
but he can't remember them. There is a pent-up violence in this amnesia, and it 
works for a while; it gives Val the effect of an explosion waiting to take 
place. It is hard to sustain latency, however. After 100 pages or so he seems 
not so much mysterious as null. When the violence does come -- it coincides 
with Val's beginning to remember his past -- it is muted and anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
Climax would be against the purpose of the book. Father Gilvary's growing 
blindness is more of a dramatic theme than Val's stranger-in-town turbulence. 
Time, in a sense, is the action in "Ordinary Time." It is a haunting concept, 
and in many ways this is a distinguished book.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: DUCK DECOYS HAVE LENGTHY HISTORY, WIDE PRICE RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have some old duck decoys handed down to me by my father. I believe 
he told me they were carved in Detroit, where he was from. What sort of 
information can you give me regarding their value and history? -- H.T. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were several companies 
manufacturing duck decoys in Detroit. Among those firms two names stand out: 
Mason and Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of collectible decoys can range widely, from about $100 to more than 
$15,000. A genuine Mason decoy, for example, can bring $3,000 or more, 
according to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, price is directly related to original condition. 
</P>
<P>
Decoy collectors want original parts, and replaced heads or bills or missing 
parts translate into depreciation. Most importantly, repainting a decoy is 
almost always a mistake; collectors invariably are attracted by original paint 
and generally frown on repainting and refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
It may be difficult for you to precisely tell which factory produced your 
decoy, because early decoys were not necessarily stamped or signed with either 
the place of production or the carver. Still, veteran collectors can identify 
decoy artists through their carving style. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfowl decoys in this country have a long history. They were used by the 
Indians before the colonists arrived and were then copied by the settlers. 
Indian hunters tended to use decoys shaped from various natural materials, 
whereas the settlers preferred to carve their decoys from blocks of wood. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"From the White House Inkwell: American Presidential Autographs" is an updated, 
expanded edition of a 1968 book by John Taylor, a longtime collector of 
presidential autographs, letters and manuscripts. The 257-page book (Modoc 
Press Inc., Suite 318, 506 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, Calif. 90401; 
paperback, $13.95) has 130 facsimile autograph plates and an index. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor discusses writing idiosyncrasies of the presidents, from Washington to 
Bush, and the scarcity or frequency of their autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor notes that there are "two clouds on the horizon for collectors of 
presidential signatures." 
</P>
<P>
The first involves escalating prices, which, he says, means that "collectors of 
modest means are less concerned with theoretical availability than with the 
basic question of whether they can afford a certain autograph." 
</P>
<P>
The second "cloud," according to Taylor, is the fact that political leaders are 
transacting less and less business by mail, and so, what becomes available is 
"increasingly mundane."

ROGER SIMON: SMOKING OUT HOLLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All politicians say things they later regret. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dukakis said: "This campaign is not about ideology; it's about 
competence." 
</P>
<P>
George Bush said: "Forty-seven years ago to this very day (Sept. 7, 1988) we 
were hit and hit hard at Pearl Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
And Richard Nixon said: "I am not a crook." 
</P>
<P>
Now we have Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), a man I have always liked. I briefly 
covered his 1984 presidential campaign -- it lasted only briefly -- and he was 
a charming guy, a guy I loved to listen to. 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in opposing a ban on smoking on U.S. airline flights, Hollings said: 
"The Indians were smoking when we got here!" 
</P>
<P>
And you thought the era of great debate was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Congress banned smoking on domestic airline flights shorter than two hours on 
April 23, 1988. This ban is due to expire April 23, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Appropriations Committee voted last week, however, to ban smoking on 
all domestic flights, no matter how long they are. 
</P>
<P>
The ban makes sense. Cigarette smoke causes lung cancer and other diseases. And 
airplanes have lousy air circulation systems. As studies have shown -- and as 
any nonsmoker can tell you -- smoke from the smoker's section of a plane is 
circulated very quickly to the nonsmoking section. 
</P>
<P>
The logical answer is to ban smoking on all flights. 
</P>
<P>
This is not logical to Hollings, however. All politics is local, the old saying 
goes, and Hollings comes from a tobacco-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
So in the committee hearings he spoke vociferously against the ban. And 
afterward, there was this fascinating scene, as reported by Alan Fram of the 
Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
"Minutes after the Senate Appropriations Committee's decision last week to 
expand the smoke ban aboard airliners, tobacco-state Sen. Ernest Hollings stood 
in a Capitol corridor talking about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Interrupting the conversation, a bald, rotund man in a suit sauntered up from 
behind the lawmaker and reached out to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Thanks on behalf of R. J. Reynolds,' he told a smiling Hollings (D-S.C.), 
who had just been on the losing side of two votes aimed at diluting the 
prohibition. 'It was a good try, but it was stacked against us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not that the fight is over. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) won't rule out a 
filibuster when the bill comes to the Senate floor and there is still the House 
to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the exchange between Hollings and the R. J. Reynolds lobbyist shows, 
the tobacco producers know a thing or two about lawmaking. They know money 
fuels the engine of democracy. According to Common Cause, the cigarette 
industry gave members of Congress $261,000 in speaking fees last year, more 
money than any other industry. 
</P>
<P>
You can see why: The cigarette industry needs more than 1,000 new smokers each 
day to replace those who die each day from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Even most smokers support a ban on airline smoking. A poll sponsored by the 
American Assn. of Respiratory Care showed that 51.7% of smokers approve a ban 
on smoking on airlines, and nearly 60% of smokers favor the current 
short-flight ban. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollings has a rejoinder: "The Indians were smoking when we got here!" 
</P>
<P>
It is true. Smoking is an American tradition. The Indians were doing it when we 
came here to steal their land. And I think they gave us tobacco as revenge.

CLASS ON HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION -- IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tell Bobbette Fleschler that there "ain't no culture in the Valley" and she'll 
tell you to sign up for her new Cal State Northridge extension course that 
disproves it. 
</P>
<P>
Saying she got tired of continually hearing about a "desolate community" filled 
with nothing but Valley girls, Fleschler, 31, a 1981 CSUN history graduate and 
president of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society, decided to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"But in order to prove your point, you have to do the research and find out 
what actually does exist and come up with a good answer to such accusations," 
she said. "What I found is there has been a rich life here. 
</P>
<P>
"Valley history parallels a lot of major themes that have occurred elsewhere in 
California, including growth and development, railroad participation, dividing 
up the area into a suburb, and how in just this one little place it has all 
occurred," Fleschler said. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "A History of the San Fernando Valley," Fleschler's non-credit course, 
will meet once a week for six weeks beginning Sept. 20. It will work its way 
from Indian culture to the arrival of Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola in 
1769 to the present and possibilities for the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indian Settlements 
</P>
<P>
It is the pre-Spanish Valley that residents are least aware of, she says, 
explaining that few people realize that there were major Indian settlements, 
predominantly in what is now the city of San Fernando, the Topanga Canyon area 
and the Chatsworth hills. 
</P>
<P>
"But you won't find them in the plain of the Valley," she said, explaining that 
even then "there wasn't sufficient water." Part of the course will deal with 
what remains of Indian sites and the issue of removing artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
The history course includes ranchos, the eventual Americanization of the 
Valley, various land booms and busts in the late 1800s, the continual search 
for water, and the emergence of early communities such as Van Nuys and 
Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). 
</P>
<P>
Other discussions will cover the 1920-1945 slow-growth era -- 1930 population 
density maps for Chatsworth indicate two people per acre. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, "there's the development of Lockheed in Burbank and wartime 
industry," Fleschler said. "But the rest of the San Fernando Valley went 
through a very quiet period. 
</P>
<P>
"People from the motion picture industry came out here and developed horse 
ranches, but we maintained a very rural personality," she said. "It was very 
laid-back and peaceful, almost idyllic." 
</P>
<P>
Things changed remarkably in the next period, after World War II and the 
emergence of suburbia, freeways and shopping centers from 1945 to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
There have been courses in Valley history offered by Valley, Mission and Pierce 
colleges, Fleschler said, but she believes that this is the first 
university-level course, as well as the first to include a discussion of the 
tools a historian uses to uncover and make history more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look at deeds, grant deeds and incorporation papers and see what they 
can reveal to somebody researching history," she said. "Another lecture will 
focus on photography and how a photo can reveal considerable information to 
someone who knows how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Fleschler says she plans to include an oral history segment where residents who 
have lived here many decades will share and record their impressions of the 
Valley and how it has changed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long History Here' 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a move for a sense of community awareness and preservation, 
what with all the freeways crisscrossing and the Porter Ranch development," she 
said. "But on a day-to-day basis, we do take for granted our life out here. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be able to show not only that there is a long and interesting 
history here, but also that students will go away with a sense that it is at 
their fingertips. It's right in their streets and communities, and they can 
actively participate both in uncovering it and preserving it." 
</P>
<P>
A field trip is scheduled Oct. 28 as a finale to the course, and although 
Fleschler says she doesn't have the exact itinerary worked out, it should 
include Indian artifacts and abandoned attempts by early railroads to find a 
westward mountain pass. Other sites will be determined by the class. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN extension class will meet from 7 to 10 p.m. Wednesdays. The fee is 
$65. For information, call CSUN at (818) 885-2644.

KICK-BOXING LUNGES FOR THE BIG TIME AFTER HOLLYWOOD GAINS A TOEHOLD WITH NEW 
MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
KICKING UP A FUSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guys down at the Jet Center gym in Van Nuys won't admit that their beloved 
sport of kick-boxing has gone Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't deny that recent events have brought some glitz to the ancient 
Thai fighting style that had previously been thought of in terms of blood, 
sweat and toenails. 
</P>
<P>
The Jet Center is run by Benny (The Jet) Urquidez, a San Fernando native who is 
recognized as one of the greatest kick-boxers ever, and it may be the 
best-known kick-boxing gym in the United States -- which is to say that it 
remains virtually unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Kick-boxing is a major sport in Asia, but Urquidez has been struggling for 15 
years to sell the sport to America. He has been promoting fights across the 
country and trying unsuccessfully for big crowds and big money. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all of a sudden, Hollywood has gotten into the act. Over the last two 
years, half a dozen movies featuring kick-boxing have been released. Some have 
been purely action-adventure affairs, films with titles such as "Bloodsport" 
and "Bloodfist." Jean-Claude Van Damme's new movie "Kick Boxer" opened last 
week, and Chuck Norris is planning a kick-boxing movie as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Movies 
</P>
<P>
But others have been regular movies. John Cusack played a kick-boxing teen-ager 
in "Say Anything." Patrick Swayze used kick-boxing techniques as a bouncer in 
"Road House." The sport has become almost, well, hip. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport of the future," Cusack says, if somewhat facetiously, in his movie 
role. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has the guys down at the Jet Center smelling a chance at success. 
All of which led to fight night on a recent Thursday at the Hollywood 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
The "Evening of World Championship KickBoxing" was as much a scene as it was a 
sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
A ring was erected in the Palladium's red-carpeted ballroom, beneath massive 
chandeliers. Jacketed waiters scurried about with trays of drinks from the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Boxing has a beer-drinking crowd," Urquidez said. "Kick-boxing has a 
champagne-drinking crowd." 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Australian publicity men hired specifically for this event were 
promising that such celebrities as Swayze, Mickey Rourke and Sylvester Stallone 
would soon arrive. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the first of six bouts began at 8 p.m., the only luminaries in 
attendance were David Lee Roth and Iron Eyes Cody. 
</P>
<P>
The initial matches were conducted by less-experienced fighters paid $100 a 
round to beat each other up. They would circle within the ring, suddenly charge 
together in a mass of arms and legs, then separate and repeat the process. 
</P>
<P>
"If you worry about pain, you're in the wrong sport," said Melvin Murray, a 
Canadian welterweight who was hit often and hard while losing his bout. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 2,000 seemed pleased with the action. This was a mixed 
audience: families with children, biker types, attractive women in tight black 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Urquidez's proclamation, they were the kind of people who drink beer. 
"A lot of beer," said Carl, one of the bartenders at the Palladium. And they 
were the kind of people who said they were fed up with boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"With kick-boxing," one man said, "there are less rules involved." 
</P>
<P>
"This is like real fighting," another said. 
</P>
<P>
Kick-boxing may feature some of the Oriental grace associated with martial 
arts, but it emphasizes all-out combat: fists, elbows, knees and feet. 
Combatants fight three-minute rounds and wear virtually no padding. 
</P>
<P>
Thrust kicks will land flush on an opponent's jaw and snap his head back. A 
roundhouse kick will smack against the opponent's thigh with a meaty thud. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like a good kick," said Kevin Gow, one of the publicity men. 
"People can feel a kick in the bloody crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Jill Schwartz and Tiffany Miami said they could feel the kicks. The women, both 
in their early 20s, were making their first visit to see kick-boxing and sat 
close together for the first hour, clutching each other's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought, 'This is a horrible, aggressive, terrifying sport,' " Schwartz 
said. "But now we're really into it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promoters Scramble 
</P>
<P>
By 9:30 p.m., the preliminary bouts were finished and the promoters were sent 
scrambling: Word was that Stallone and Rourke were about to arrive, bringing 
along "Batman" producer Jon Peters. Was their table ready? 
</P>
<P>
The bouts at the Palladium were meant as a kickoff for a worldwide campaign 
orchestrated from the Jet Center just off Van Nuys Boulevard. The "Evening of 
KickBoxing" is scheduled to go on the road soon, a sort of traveling sideshow 
of knuckles and heels that will visit 12 cities in the United States and Japan, 
England, Mexico and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidez and co-promoter Blinky Rodriguez, his brother-in-law, are not 
attempting this feat alone. They persuaded Norris to lend his name to the 
events. And they enlisted Joe Kaufenberg, a T-shirt maker who boasts of 
extensive connections in Las Vegas, boxing circles and corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a promotional guy. I make T-shirts and ceramics. I work with Fortune 500 
companies," said Kaufenberg, whose company is based in Southern California. 
"Before this, I was in the whiskey business for 25 years. I started the first 
ceramic Elvis Presley decanters. I know what you have to do to start 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufenberg got Coors and Harrah's to sponsor the Palladium event. And he was 
beaming during the fights. One close match featured a fighter, Ricky Valentin, 
with a mongoose painted on his stomach. Another particularly vicious bout 
between female bantamweights Pixie Elmore and Kathy Long brought the crowd to 
its feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting on a show out here," said Elmore, who displayed toughness by 
beating her shins with a piece of wood in her dressing room after the match. 
"You can't just go out there and be good at your sport. You have to sell 
yourself. You have to build up the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rousing Knockout 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent bout, Australian champion Stan (The Man) Longnidis scored a 
rousing knockout over his heavyweight opponent -- a fellow with a Mohawk, bad 
teeth and chains around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the main event was set to begin. But where was Stallone? Rourke? 
Swayze? 
</P>
<P>
No matter. World super-lightweight champion Peter (Sugarfoot) Cunningham, a 
Canadian who trains at the Jet Center, earned loud cheers from the crowd with 
his fighting against Nobuya Azuka of Japan. Cunningham, who was paid $8,000, 
displayed as much physical talent and agility as any top-ranked professional 
boxer. Away from the ring, he was philosophical about having chosen a 
little-known sport as his profession. 
</P>
<P>
"My main reason for sticking with kick-boxing is that I seem to dominate in 
this sport," the five-time titleholder said. "You have to stick with a winning 
card." 
</P>
<P>
If Urquidez and Rodriguez can make good on half of their lofty promises for 
kick-boxing, Cunningham could find himself in the big time. It appears to be a 
formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
"With boxing, there are lot of household names," said Libby King, director of 
program acquisitions for ESPN, which has broadcast kick-boxing's cousin, 
full-contact karate, to decent but unimpressive ratings for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Kick-boxing "doesn't have that recognition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
King said the sport has also suffered from constant changing and rearranging of 
numerous organizations -- among them the Professional Karate Assn., the World 
Karate Assn. and the Karate International Council of Kickboxing -- that sponsor 
and sanction matches. 
</P>
<P>
The Jet Center folks are hoping that celebrities such as Norris and Stallone -- 
whom, they have assured, will attend the Oct. 12 fights at the Palladium -- 
will give their sport the star billing it needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The image we create for this sport is very important," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took 15 years to get kick-boxing where it's now. Fifteen years of 
experimenting," Urquidez said. "Now people are ready for it."

'MAHAGONNY' GOES HOLLYWOOD, BLATHERING ALL THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: Martin Bernheimer's review of "The Rise and Fall of the City of 
Mahagonny" did not run in its entirety in Tuesday's editions. The following is 
the complete review. 
</P>
<P>
Lights. Camera. Inaction. "Mahagonny" has come to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, alas, wasn't necessary. And getting there wasn't half the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Play it again, Kurt? No, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Ready when you are, B.B.? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Just show me the way to the next whiskey bar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you're wondering what this blather is all about. That seems reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
What doesn't seem all that reasonable is the blathering new production of "The 
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny," a.k.a. "Aufsteig und Fall der Stadt 
Mahagonny," staged by Jonathan Miller and designed by Robert Israel for the 
Music Center Opera. It was introduced, amid mild consternation offset by polite 
applause, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. It is a very clever production. It is stylish and it wants 
to be bold. It brims with invention. It has a look. It boasts a hard-working, 
versatile, youthful cast. It sounds good. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong again. It does work, after a fashion. It works after a 
rather trendy, eminently gimmicky, oddly revisionist, ultimately ponderous 
fashion. It works on Miller's and Israel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the terms defined by Kurt Weill and Bertolt 
Brecht. And they did write the piece. 
</P>
<P>
It is a difficult piece. No question about that. It also is a period piece. 
That's what seems to have caused the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Israel don't seem to like, or trust, the intended period. That is 
their privilege. If only they had come up with something better. 
</P>
<P>
"Mahagonny" is a product of Germany in the late 1920s -- a Germany 
contemplating glitzy illusions while reeling from a disaster and preparing for 
a cataclysm. The opera is a bleak, unsentimental, probing satire on political 
oppression, sociological inequity and economic disorder. It reeks of fine 
Berliner decadence and cabaret banality. 
</P>
<P>
It pretends to be about a distant, patently elusive, deceptively wondrous, 
perpetually tacky never-neverland where the streets are lined with gold. The 
locale was vaguely associated with Amerika. 
</P>
<P>
However, Weill and Brecht didn't concern themselves with the petty realities of 
the United States. They toyed, knowingly, with popular misimpressions of this 
promised land as filtered through seemingly naive yet chronically bitter 
Germanic sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Israel have taken away the filters. They have turned the desolate, 
essentially mythic region prescribed in the libretto into a soundstage in 
Tinseltown during its heyday. See the lights. Note the sculpted palm tree? 
</P>
<P>
The thugs, molls, crooks and honorable representatives of the Lumpenproletariat 
become icons of the silver screen. So much for Brechtian alienation. Away we 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Mahoney, the lumberjack hero, is transformed into a wide-eyed matinee 
idol, and he gets his name changed to MacIntyre (presumably because it scans 
better). Jenny, the sensuous whore with a heart of tin, is turned into a 
kinky-haired Mary Pickford in a prim white dress. The Widow Begbick, the madam 
who used to be tougher than nails, gets glamorized as a strange fusion of 
Margaret Dumont and Mae West. 
</P>
<P>
Jakob Schmidt is reduced to just plain Jack, but he looks like a caricature of 
Dr. Caligari. Fatty, who isn't fat any more, might pass in the dark for Harold 
Lloyd. Trinity Moses, the prize-fighter, impersonates Emil Jannings 
impersonating Marlene Dietrich's professorial victim in "The Blue Angel." 
Keystone Kops pop up in the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
It is all so smart and so cute. It is all so wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The music proves that it is wrong. Weill's symphonic distillation of blues 
numbers and fox trots and jazz accents and ragtime indulgences, his inspired 
flights of self-mocking vulgarity, his funky syncopations, his dogged 
repetitions, his harmonic jolts and rhythmic jabs -- all insist on the ambience 
of Deutschland between the wars. The parodistic songs conveyed precise 
messages. The Nazis noticed this when they labeled "Mahagonny" a degenerate 
exercise in cultural Bolshevism. 
</P>
<P>
In his nasty, raw, insinuating, ultimately poignant way, Weill bolstered 
Brecht's vision of epic theater. Forget it in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center Opera did not deem it worthwhile to explain the Miller-Israel 
concept in a program note. The management did choose, however, to perform the 
opera in the spicy English version of Michael Feingold. So far, so good. Then 
the management insulted the translator, the audience and the singers with the 
distracting redundancy of English supertitles. 
</P>
<P>
If some members of the cast garbled the text, diction lessons (or more careful 
casting) might be a better solution. If supertitles are really imperative, then 
we might as well have the opera in properly atmospheric German. That at least 
would make the exoticism of the two clumsy-English songs in the original score 
all the more striking. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Nagano conducted with sympathetic brio, if without much concern for 
dramatic contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the work was compromised further by pallid principals. Gary 
Bachlund sang the strenuous music of Jimmy with the fervent tones of a would-be 
Heldentenor while exuding minimal desperation. Anna Steiger introduced a plump 
and pretty Jenny with a musical-comedy soprano that conveyed nothing sexy about 
the moon of Alabama. Marvellee Cariaga struck overstuffed-diva poses as the 
sleazy Widow Begbick and mustered lightweight vocalism where one wanted 
growling thunder. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast fared better. Greg Fedderly emerged sprightly as Fatty. 
Michael Gallup oozed unction as Trinity Moses. Jonathan Mack offered a craftily 
disgusting portrait of Jack, the glutton who devours whole calves. Louis 
Lebherz made an endearing old bear of Alaska-Wolf-Joe. John Atkins deftly 
sketched the ineffectual innocence of Pennybank Bill. Bruce Johnson was the 
clean-cut Toby Higgins, and Grant Gershon tickled the onstage ivories grandly 
with "The Maiden's Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
The opera closes with a momentous dirge, "Nothing you can do will help a dead 
man." At the very end, the director contradicted the composer and librettist 
one last time, allowing the three assembled corpses suddenly to spring back to 
life, wink at the audience, and shrug. 
</P>
<P>
That must mean something.

AGREEMENT ON DAY LABORER SITE IN DANGER OF CRUMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost a year after the city of Glendale and representatives of Latino 
organizations struck an agreement on a gathering site for day laborers, the 
city's strategy to keep the workers off the streets is in serious danger of 
falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Youth Organization, which had volunteered its youth center on San 
Fernando Road as a pickup site, no longer welcomes the day laborers, and city 
officials are scrambling to find a new gathering spot. 
</P>
<P>
The CYO closed its gates to the day laborers Monday when the two part-time 
employees hired to supervise the workers returned to school-related jobs, CYO 
Director Luisa Chavez said. The youth center had opened its grounds to the 
workers in September, 1988, to head off a hotly debated city ordinance that 
would have made it illegal to solicit work on public property. The ordinance 
was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly 60 day laborers, most of them illegal immigrants, wait for work 
each day on a five-block stretch of San Fernando Road near the CYO. Another 20 
to 30 have returned to the sidewalk in front of a paint store on Jackson Street 
and Broadway in the heart of the downtown commercial district -- the unofficial 
pickup site until the workers moved to the CYO. 
</P>
<P>
A solution to the crisis may be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dick Jutras met Monday with the head of the Glendale chapter of the 
Salvation Army, who said his group is willing take over supervision of the day 
laborer program. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a need, we stand ready to help," said Lt. Kenneth Hodder, the 
chapter's commanding officer. "The discussions are at a very early stage, but 
we have indicated to the city our willingness to help in terms of administering 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale City Council members indicated that they would welcome the Salvation 
Army's help. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get a program working, that would be great," Councilwoman Ginger 
Bremberg said. "Everything they do, they do wonderfully well." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David Ramsay said the solution to the day laborer problem should 
come from the community, from private organizations such as the Salvation Army 
and the CYO, and that the city should not get heavily involved, financially or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community problem that the city does not wish to own," he said. "I 
don't think it's up to the cities to resolve an international economics 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Locating a permanent gathering site for the workers remains a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said she "doubts very much" that workers would be welcomed back to the 
CYO, even if new supervisors are hired. Since the day laborer program began, 
the CYO day-care program has suffered a drop of more than half its enrollment, 
Chavez said. Parents were afraid to leave their children at the center while 
dozens of workers packed the CYO parking lot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall Program 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the CYO will begin its fall day-care program, and Chavez hopes that 
attendance will rise after the yearlong slump during the day laborers' 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Hodder said the Salvation Army is equally unprepared to provide a pickup site. 
"We want to help, but we can't do it here at the Salvation Army," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said that the city's search for a gathering site has been unsuccessful 
to date, but that he plans to "call a staff meeting in the next couple of weeks 
to see what options are available."

OVERRULING ITS STAFF, COASTAL PANEL OKS PEPPERDINE EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission this week voted to allow Pepperdine 
University to double its student enrollment and nearly triple the size of its 
seaside campus, saying that the educational benefits of the expansion 
outweighed its potential for extensive adverse effects on Malibu's environment. 
</P>
<P>
In approving Pepperdine's long-range development plan by a 7-5 vote, the 
commission rejected its own staff recommendation that the university confine 
all new construction to the 225 acres that it has already graded and developed 
in the hills between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pepperdine will be able to build nearly 1.5 million square feet of new 
facilities on an undeveloped 72-acre section of the campus. The development 
will allow Pepperdine to increase its student population to nearly 7,000 by the 
end of the century. Enrollment now is about 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the commission, whose approval is necessary for all development 
projects in the state's coastal zone, was a major victory for the school, which 
has pursued its ambitious development plan for more than six years. And it was 
a sizable setback for community activists, who fear Pepperdine's expansion will 
transform Malibu into a booming college town. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-hour hearing in Marina del Rey on Tuesday, coastal panel 
members also rejected several amendments to the plan that would have required 
the university to preserve forever hundreds of acres of undeveloped hillside 
property. The commission said it would accept the university's assurances that 
it would not develop the land and will not require Pepperdine to make the 
guarantees in writing. The development plan, however, does require Pepperdine 
to dedicate 150 acres of land as open space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Surprised' 
</P>
<P>
"Deciding not to place any restrictions on the other undeveloped areas of 
campus is even worse than approving the plan," said Sara Wan, a member of the 
Malibu Township Council. "Obviously, we're disappointed, but we're not 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Township Council members said they would consider a lawsuit to block the plan. 
They contend that the Pepperdine expansion, which will require grading of 3 
million cubic yards of dirt, violates the Coastal Act because the plan does not 
include adequate measures to offset the increase in traffic and damage to 
natural vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
"My duty is to uphold the Coastal Act and hold developers responsible for 
abiding by it, and we're not doing that here," said Madelyn Glickfeld, a 
commissioner who voted against the plan. "I think that a narrow majority of the 
commission believes that Pepperdine doesn't fall under the Coastal Act. And I 
think we've left ourselves open to litigation." 
</P>
<P>
University officials applauded the commission's decision, which they said was 
necessary if Pepperdine is to move into the top rank of the nation's private 
liberal arts colleges. They argued that the only way to scale down the size of 
the expansion was to drop several academic programs, an alternative they said 
was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are first and foremost an educational facility," said Andrew Benton, vice 
president of university affairs. "We only want to develop 72 acres out of 600 
acres, and we don't believe that is unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanded Library 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine officials say that the overall impact will be offset by spreading 
the development and student population around campus and by making needed 
improvements on Pacific Coast Highway and connecting streets. 
</P>
<P>
The university wants to build more student and faculty housing, a new business 
and management school and a student recreation center, and to expand the law 
school library and tennis facility. Most of the money for these projects, 
estimated at $45 million, has already been raised, according to school 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative, Christian school was unable to win over community 
leaders, who are still upset that officials at the 830-acre campus lobbied 
successfully to be removed from the boundaries of the proposed city of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen residents and activists testified that Pepperdine's development 
plan would contribute to traffic problems on Pacific Coast Highway and cause 
further harm to landslide-plagued areas next to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal commission staff analysts objected to the proposed construction in the 
undeveloped areas of campus, saying that the extensive grading required would 
destroy natural vegetation. University officials argued, however, that the 
staff's revised plan of building new facilities in the developed area of campus 
would make the college too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to reject the staff recommendations, several commissioners said the 
college should not be viewed as a private developer, instead noting the 
"cultural and educational benefits" the community would receive if Pepperdine 
expanded.

IT'S NOT DEAD YET; 
</P>
<P>
YIDDISH IS THE COMMON LANGUAGE NOWHERE ON EARTH, BUT IT'S THE MOTHER TONGUE FOR 
SOME JEWS SEEKING THEIR ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yiddish has been dying a slow death for at least 50 years, but lovers of the 
Jewish language of Eastern European villages and East Coast immigrant slums 
still cling to the mame-loshn, their mother tongue, even in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
They go to literary lectures, informal discussion groups, classes and 
songfests. Orthodox Jews sometimes debate the Talmud in Yiddish. Old people on 
bus benches in Jewish neighborhoods gossip in the language of their youth. And 
a small but growing number of younger Jews who grew up speaking English are 
turning to Yiddish studies. 
</P>
<P>
This much activity might have surprised the pioneers of the Los Angeles Yiddish 
Culture Club, who drew up a 50-year charter when they staged their first 
evening of tea and cake in 1926. Even then, Yiddishists were worried that 
America would prove rocky ground for their transplanted tongue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three years later, the club still stages a formal program every Saturday 
night from October through June at the Institute of Jewish Education on 3rd 
Street in the Fairfax District, but no one knows how long it will last. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no one really knows how many Yiddish speakers there are -- either in 
Southern California, home to an estimated 700,000 Jews, or in the world at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
"While the use of the language as a primary vernacular has been declining, 
interest in it, both sentimental and seriously intellectual, has been rising," 
says the Jewish Encyclopedia. "(T)he measurement of the present knowledge of 
Yiddish . . . requires tools far subtler than those of ordinary censuses." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no doubt that the number has been shrinking. Joshua Fishman, a 
sociolinguist who teaches at Yeshiva and Stanford universities, said there may 
be 3.5 million Yiddish speakers in the world today, including about 1.25 
million in the United States, compared to an estimated 12 million worldwide and 
just under 3 million in this country on the eve of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish (the name literally means Jewish) has its roots in the Dark Ages, when 
Jews who lived in southern France and northern Italy migrated into what is now 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke their own language, similar to the Romance languages of that day, 
but exchanged it for a form of medieval German, adding words from Hebrew and 
using the Hebrew alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinct From Modern German 
</P>
<P>
Modern Yiddish emerged as they gradually moved to Eastern Europe. It is 
distinct from modern German, with words folded in from Hebrew and the Slavic 
and Romance languages like so many raisins in a New Year's koylitsh (egg 
bread). 
</P>
<P>
From the early 1800s on, as more worldly Jews became a part of the cultures 
around them, some looked down on Yiddish as a zhargon, the language of ignorant 
village folk. 
</P>
<P>
But that ignored a rich literary tradition that goes back at least as far as 
1272, and a secular Yiddish literature that flowered from the middle of the 
19th Century on. Novels, plays, poetry and newspapers appeared in the language, 
along with prayer books and translations from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
In waves of emigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 7 
million European Jews spread the language to the United States, Canada, South 
America and what is now Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But others stayed behind. Most of them were gassed or shot or died of cold and 
hunger in concentration camps after Nazi forces conquered the Jewish centers of 
Eastern Europe. Of the 6 million Jews put to death during World War II, about 5 
million were Yiddish speakers, Fishman said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Hebrew had become the language of the Jewish settlers in Palestine. In 
Stalin's Soviet Union, Yiddish and all other aspects of Jewish culture were 
stifled. And in the United States, Yiddish was often discarded as worn-out 
baggage from the old country. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis was Americanization," recalled Irving Teitelbaum, 67, a building 
contractor who arrived in Chicago from Poland 50 years ago. "One week after I 
came to this country my brother schlepped me to night classes and said, 'Learn 
English.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Dead Yet 
</P>
<P>
Now, except for some ultra-religious enclaves in Israel and the East Coast, and 
a small circle of secularists in New York whose Yiddish-language nursery school 
is so popular that it has a waiting list, there is nowhere left where Yiddish 
is the common language. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that Yiddish is quite dead yet. 
</P>
<P>
The kultur klub (pronounced "cool-toor kloob") has extended its stay 
indefinitely at the Institute of Jewish Education, and classes at the Workmen's 
Circle, Santa Monica College and the West Valley Jewish Community Center had 
147 students at last count. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose people every year, simply because of the fact that people are dying," 
said Moshe Cohen, 78, president of the Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club. "But 
somehow we find people who've exchanged playing cards on Saturday evenings for 
something more creative. We have a half-dozen young people too." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 senior citizens gather there once a week for lectures, musical 
programs, tea, cake and a chat. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups of first- and second-generation Americans meet as far afield as 
Anaheim, Arcadia, Long Beach and Laguna Niguel for informal evenings of Yiddish 
literature and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Zionists, Socialists and disillusioned Communists speak the language at 
political meetings. Shoppers and shopkeepers use it in the bakeries and butcher 
shops of the old Jewish neighborhoods of Fairfax and Pico-Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Services Generally in Hebrew 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Jews often speak Yiddish in their synagogues, although services are 
generally conducted in Hebrew, the ancient language of the Bible and the prayer 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish speakers can also use the language as far away as Moscow and Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to fly to a lot of places around the world, and I found that a lot of 
people speak Yiddish," said Sy Cohen, 70, of Los Angeles, a retired pilot for 
the Flying Tiger line. "Somehow you'd look somebody in the face and something 
would make you both say, 'Vos makht a yid (How's it going)?' " 
</P>
<P>
A World War II veteran of the Air Transport Command, Cohen said Yiddish came in 
handy when he volunteered to fly supply missions during Israel's War of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two pilots who escaped from Russia and we put them in the cockpit 
as co-pilots," he said. Since no one spoke Hebrew, the Americans and the 
Russians communicated in Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
"We would say aruf mitn (up with the) gear, arop mitn (down with the) gear," 
Cohen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Herbst, a Los Angeles artist and folk singer, fell in love with the 
language when a friend played a record of folk songs for her, but she said it 
can be useful too. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still more speakers of Yiddish than there are of Esperanto, if 
you're looking for a practical reason for speaking Yiddish," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Herbst, 57, goes beyond practicality in explaining its appeal. "It's my 
language," she said. "Some people are obsessed by French and French culture. 
Me, I'm obsessed with Yiddish, with Yiddish culture. It's a mystical thing." 
</P>
<P>
The pungent sounds of Yiddish have also begun to tantalize people who did not 
drink them in with their mothers' milk. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 students are learning their alef-beyz (alphabet) and other basics 
at UCLA and at Jewish institutions such as the University of Judaism and the 
Workmen's Circle, a fraternal organization on Robertson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to learn Yiddish. It was always the language of secrets in my 
home," said Susan Page, 40, of Garden Grove, who studied Yiddish at a Jewish 
Community Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the alphabet, she progressed until she could write a letter in 
Yiddish to her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she said. "I feel a real good connection with Jewish people in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five to 100 people, many of them in the 40-to-50 age group, are 
expected to take classes in Yiddish at the University of Judaism this fall, and 
an additional 200 may attend lectures on Yiddish literature, Yiddish theater 
and the history of Yiddish folk songs. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who are in search of their roots . . . not people who know 
the language, but people who have the feel of it or the smell of it," said 
Rabbi Jack Shechter, director of extension courses at the campus in the Santa 
Monica Mountains above Sepulveda Pass. "It's a way . . . to deal with the 
Jewish side of them." 
</P>
<P>
Even in the most strictly observant neighborhoods of Jewish Los Angeles, where 
women in long dresses and men in long beards throng the sidewalks on their way 
to shul (synagogue) on Saturday mornings, many parents speak with their 
children in English. Others make a point of using Yiddish, said Rabbi Chaim 
Schnur, 39, director of Agudath Israel, an agency that lobbies for Orthodox 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yiddish is still perceived by many as having an intrinsic value, as being the 
language of the Jew, and it shouldn't be forgotten. It should be preserved," 
Schnur said. "Some of the older boys in yeshiva (high school) study in Yiddish, 
because that's a form of discussion that goes back" to the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Yiddishists send money to YIVO, a research institute in New York, 
and help gather books for the National Yiddish Book Center, in Amherst, Mass., 
which has saved about 900,000 old Yiddish books and sent out tens of thousands 
to individuals and libraries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 of those volumes came from Southern California, said Nanci Glick, 
associate director of the center, whose founder, an energetic 34-year-old 
former graduate student named Aaron Lansky, was just awarded a $250,000 
MacArthur Foundation grant. He expects to use it to send Yiddish books to the 
Soviet Union, Glick said. 
</P>
<P>
These groups may well be the saving of Yiddish in America. By the year 2010, 
Fishman predicts, the number of speakers will stabilize at just under 1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time its speakers, as distinguished from its admirers and those who 
have love affairs with it from afar, will probably be ultra-Orthodox," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years Yiddish students at universities have amused themselves by 
inventing words: shneykishele (marshmallow -- literally, "little snow pillow"), 
kurtskes (short pants -- a diminutive and plural form of kurts, which means 
short). 
</P>
<P>
The standard text, "College Yiddish," has gone through 17 printings since it 
was first published in 1949, and a simpler primer, "Learning Yiddish in Early 
Stages," was reprinted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Janet Hadda, 43, an associate professor of Yiddish at UCLA, said the 
success of college programs -- there are about 60 in the United States -- does 
not mean that the language is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Her classes in Yiddish as a language attract no more than a handful of 
students, while a poetry class taught in English last spring drew 35, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I teach conversations to my students in elementary Yiddish, they and I 
know I'm not training them to spend their junior year abroad in Yiddishland," 
she said. "Although I do hear reports of former students using their Yiddish in 
diverse situations, they are unlikely to go out into the world, find a mate who 
speaks Yiddish and conduct a courtship in that language." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some have found that Yiddish can be fun -- and a way to meet people. 
</P>
<P>
A Berkeley resident, for example, recently advertised in the National Yiddish 
Book Center's monthly publication "to find and have a correspondence, in the 
warmth of Yiddish, with another gay Yiddishist." 
</P>
<P>
Others make friends in class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling of Completeness 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me a feeling of emotional completeness and accomplishment -- and 
besides, everybody is so nice," said Sharon Baumgold, 36, an attorney who went 
by her Yiddish name, Shayndl, when she attended classes at the Workmen's 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd expect Yiddish to be a moribund language and only older people to speak 
it, but that's obviously not true. It can't be dying if we speak it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The class, made up of 10 women and one man, had gone beyond the alef-beyz to 
study the future tense and plural pronouns, but Abe Friedman, who taught the 
classes last year, said most of his students are not interested in grammatical 
niceties. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get into the dative, accusative and genitive cases, I lose half my 
class. People run away," he said. "I taught it the first year and I haven't 
taught it since." 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum includes songs and folklore, including jokes about the "wise" 
men of Chelm, who thought the sea is salty because of all the herring that swim 
around in it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great link between the past and us," said Adinah Lindner, a social 
worker at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Lindner said she uses Yiddish sometimes 
with some of her older immigrant clients.

"We don't want to let Yiddish go," she said. "If we don't make an effort to 
study it, to continue speaking it, there won't be Yiddish in the next 
generation, and after all the centuries . . . it would be pretty sad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Liners From Singer 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-known Yiddish writers, Isaac Bashevis Singer, had a series of 
one-liners when asked about the fate of Yiddish, a question that Yiddishists 
have been wrestling with for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish people suffer from many diseases, but amnesia is not one of them, he 
would say. 
</P>
<P>
Or, the Yiddish language is sick, but among Jews, the distance between being 
sick and dying is a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Or, why write in Yiddish? I write about ghosts. What could be more appropriate 
than a dying language? 
</P>
<P>
Or, we believe the dead will arise. The first thing they'll ask is, is there 
anything new to read in Yiddish? So I write in Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
His quips were quoted by Marvin Zuckerman, 57, an English professor at Valley 
College who taught Yiddish there for several years before it was dropped for 
budgetary reasons. Yiddish will be restored to the curriculum next spring, 
Zuckerman said, but he is not optimistic about the future of the language. 
</P>
<P>
"Lomir zich nit narn (let's not fool ourselves)," Zuckerman said. "Does it 
exist in your children's mouths? If not, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman, whose parents sent him to a secular Yiddish school in New York, said 
his own children do not speak the language, but their house is full of Yiddish 
books and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
He said parents who let children know that Yiddish was once the language of 
their people may be surprised by their eventual interest: "You never know what 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Edith Post, 61, a Los Angeles high school teacher, was inspired in the opposite 
way. Intrigued by a chance encounter with her daughter's college Yiddish 
textbook, she plans to take early retirement and move to New York to complete a 
doctorate in Yiddish studies. 
</P>
<P>
"The language sounds good in my mouth and in my head and the literature stands 
on its own feet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying it's going down, but it's not," she said. "There's a 
renaissance of Yiddish studies. And people say, 'OK, it's just going to be 
elitist.' I don't know that. . . . Who would have believed Hebrew would become 
a living language?" 
</P>
<P>
A YIDDISH SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish-speaking immigrants have added a unique spice to the English language. 
Here is a sampling of words, often used as slang, that have come into American 
usage through Yiddish, according to Webster's New World Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
blintz -- From Russian blinyets, diminutive of blin, pancake; a thin pancake 
rolled with a filling of cottage cheese or fruit. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
gefilte fish -- From German gefullter fisch; chopped fish, usually a mixture, 
as of whitefish, pike and carp, mixed with onion, egg, seasoning, and boiled, 
originally in a casing of the fish skin; usually served cold. 
</P>
<P>

Schlemihl, title character of a novel by Adelbert von Chamisso (1781-1838), 
German writer; an ineffectual, bungling person who habitually fails or is 
easily victimized. 
</P>

ENGLISH CLASSES USE NOVEL (AND STORY) APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a new school year just under way, Ventura County educators are bidding 
adieu to Dick and Jane. 
</P>
<P>
And to fill-in-the-blank workbooks, spelling drills, grammar tests and 
vocabulary lists. 
</P>
<P>
And to slow, average and fast reading groups. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps, to report cards that gauge language skills along the traditional 
lines of composition, comprehension and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic changes in English instruction stem from a state Department of 
Education study recommending greater reliance on literature than on 
memorization. The study came out in 1987, but is being implemented just this 
year in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers' Praise 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the program will be re-evaluated in 1994, but George Nemetz, a 
consultant for the Department of Education, already is convinced that it will 
serve as a model for other states. The approach was commended in November by 
the National Council of Teachers of English, and Nemetz says it is very popular 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to focus greater attention on stories, ranging from fairy tales for 
kindergartners to "Pride and Prejudice" for high school students, educators 
say. Literature would be at the core of language arts, winning back student 
interest in reading, they added. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us learned just fine under the old system, but look at us now. We 
would rather turn on the tube than read. One reason for that is that we weren't 
brought up on good books," said Chuck Weis, assistant superintendent for 
educational services in the Fillmore Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"So what we're saying now is that sure, children can memorize verbs and nouns 
and words, but that kind of learning is really limited and isn't very exciting 
for the student," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the new program can turn Jane Austen into Madonna remains to be seen, 
but administrators are enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Bay, Ventura Unified School District's director of curriculum and 
instruction: "Under the old system, for example, you just got handed a list of 
words to memorize. Now there's a tendency to say, 'Hey, let's look for those 
vocabulary words in the literature we're reading.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, Bay said, the new system will prove challenging for many teachers. "In 
many respects, it's a more difficult way to teach because you can't turn to a 
formula." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most visible differences in the classroom is that students no longer 
are grouped by ability. Instead, they all work at the same tasks at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Miller, a fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Sespe Elementary 
School in Fillmore, said: "Traditionally, children who were in the advanced 
reading groups were the ones who were given the chance to really read a book 
and discuss it in terms of ideas. Now we're giving all the students a chance to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
She said that because the curriculum calls for studying a book by using a 
variety of approaches, such as class discussions, reading aloud and placing 
students in cooperative groups for activities such as problem-solving and essay 
writing, slower learners have an easier time following, yet gifted students are 
not held back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaining Interest 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much different stuff going on in terms of how we're studying a book 
that we're not going to lose either the slow student or the gifted student, I 
don't think," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the program is under way countywide, one issue facing many schools is 
how to update report cards to better reflect this style of teaching. Many 
districts will probably modify their report cards this year, said Diana Rigby, 
coordinator of curriculum and staff development for the Ventura County 
superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Our report cards haven't yet caught up with this program, so while we're 
teaching in a way that combines all these skills into one activity, the report 
cards still have categories that say reading and spelling, etc.," said Georgene 
Fletcher, a second- and third-grade teacher at Mound Elementary School in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closer Observation 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said there will be fewer tests, requiring teachers to more closely 
observe students' problems and progress. 
</P>
<P>
However, such standardized statewide tests as those offered by the California 
Assessment Program will still be given. 
</P>
<P>
Mound, a year-round school, adopted the approach when classes resumed in July. 
So far, some teachers give it high grades. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are much more motivated by this type of reading," said Kathy 
Crowder, a Mound fifth-grade teacher. "Traditionally, language is broken up 
into little parts. That is not the most effective way to teach reading. The 
most effective way is to let children be involved. It puts it into a context."

POINT MUGU NAVAL ENGINEERS PLAY HIGH-TECH HARDBALL IN TEST OF WEAPONRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the ocean's edge at Point Mugu, a giant metal door slowly rolled open in a 
secret laboratory where the Navy tests its most advanced warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
As heavy surf pounded a seawall four stories below, a test model of an F-14 
Tomcat poked its nose out and began scanning the horizon for a target. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Tomcat, in a room with metal walls and roof to block electronic 
eavesdropping from Soviet spy ships, a high-level team of Pentagon observers 
watched as $20 million worth of computers went quietly to work. 
</P>
<P>
On this Friday morning, the Navy was beginning one of the thousands of tests it 
conducts each year at Point Mugu on the missiles, planes and Space Age laser 
weapons providing its current and future air-strike capability. 
</P>
<P>
There was a high-tech glamour to the morning's test. But on other projects of 
equal sensitivity at the Pacific Missile Test Center, there were contrasting 
scenes of nuts-and-bolts practicality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sgt. York Tanks 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere at the test center, Navy engineers were working on projects involving 
discarded $32-million Sgt. York anti-aircraft weapons picked up at Army salvage 
and even one homemade device designed to help U.S. pilots duck enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
As the Tomcat peeked out from its high-security perch, however, the Navy's 
focus was on a new infrared tracking system designed to locate enemy planes by 
the heat of their engines. It is scheduled for installation on all U.S. 
fighters in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning the test center's vast ocean range, the Tomcat homed in at random on 
military and civilian aircraft flying along the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The new system -- a backup for times when heavy electronic jamming makes radar 
tracking difficult -- stayed with every target. For the Navy, the test was one 
with a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the details of such matters at Point Mugu are never publicly 
revealed. But last week the Navy provided a rare glimpse of what goes on inside 
its most advanced air weapons test center. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the secret work is on the cutting edge of U.S. and Soviet technology, 
and many of the most sensitive projects involve electronic warfare -- the 
countermeasures and counter-countermeasures that dominate modern military 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Point Mugu is the setting for an endless military game of cat and 
mouse -- where the Navy's top civilian engineers spend lifetimes devising war 
scenarios continuously testing U.S. weapons against Soviet capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
One of those engineers is Allen Dahl, 42, who arrived at Point Mugu as a high 
school graduate in 1964 and literally grew up working on the computer software 
programs of the F-14, the Navy's primary air-to-air combat plane. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl, who now heads the computer software branch for the F-14D, an advanced 
version of the Tomcat just emerging from the development stage, is assembling 
the engineering team that will be responsible for the new plane during the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sent by the Navy to the UC Davis for his engineering degree, Dahl says most of 
his education has come from on-the-job training. "Unfortunately, all you can 
get from college is an engineering degree," he said. "You can't get an 
education in weapons systems or warfare." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nicholson Painting 
</P>
<P>
The father of six, Dahl keeps a daughter's giant painting of actor Jack 
Nicholson in his office, where he and others will map war scenarios testing the 
more than 30 on-board computers on the newest Tomcat fighters. 
</P>
<P>
With Nicholson looking demonically down from the wall during a recent 
interview, Dahl outlined some of the war games played by Point Mugu's 
Electronic Warfare Directorate in the center's high-tech Systems Integration 
Test Station, known as the SITS lab. 
</P>
<P>
Already inside the lab are two test models of the original F-14A Tomcat, Dahl 
said. Construction is under way on an adjoining $50-million laboratory where 
additional F-14D models will be placed. 
</P>
<P>
Hooked up to the most sophisticated electronic gear and military computers 
available, the planes can be made to perform inside the labs just as they would 
in actual flight conditions, Dahl said. The planes in the labs, in other words, 
are often made to think they are in actual combat. 
</P>
<P>
"The most sophisticated stuff we do, where the rubber really meets the road, is 
associated with electronic counter-countermeasure testing," Dahl said. "That 
would be where we have a jamming simulator and two or three attacking targets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modifying Plane 
</P>
<P>
The primary role of the F-14 is defense of Navy aircraft carriers in combat, 
Dahl said. About 500 F-14As are in use throughout the Navy, and about 300 of 
those will gradually be redesigned to meet F-14D configurations. 
</P>
<P>
In one typical combat scenario anticipated by Pentagon planners, Soviet bombers 
flying outside the Tomcat's range could turn on powerful jamming devices, 
allowing planes and missiles to be launched down the jamming path toward Navy 
ships, hoping to blind U.S. radar during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with such an attack, one option for the Tomcat would be to maneuver 
itself into a fresh angle on the attack area so its radar or other tracking 
sensors could lock in on enemy planes and missiles, enabling the F-14 to 
destroy as many targets as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"In real combat, there could be dozens of planes and hundreds of targets coming 
in, including bombers, fighters and cruise missiles," Dahl said. "In our 
jamming scenarios, we use very controlled tests. Maybe one bomber. The point is 
to study how the plane performs and pass that along to pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really wins most of these tests," he added. "That's where the glamour 
goes away. You don't have an easy way of scoring." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constant Updates 
</P>
<P>
Engineers at Point Mugu run electronic jamming tests on their F-14 models about 
twice a week, Dahl said. At the same time, they are constantly updating the 
computer data that go into the F-14. Near the end of every such update, a 
full-scale, multitarget combat scenario is played out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most glamorous stuff," Dahl said. "You fire 20 closely spaced 
targets at the Tomcat and see if you can overload the computer, watch the 
computer degrade. In actual combat, under ideal circumstances, the Tomcat might 
take out six incoming missiles or planes. Others could take the rest." 
</P>
<P>
While Dahl's work at the missile center represents a high-adventure, high-tech 
side of the Navy's various research projects at Point Mugu -- complete with 
theoretical dogfights and missile battles -- there is another side to the 
weapons testing work that at times can be decidedly lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Dahl's sophisticated lab, for example, is another building that 
houses Point Mugu's Electromagnetic Systems Division. While the work that takes 
place there on ultraviolet rays, gamma rays and lasers is at least as sensitive 
and sophisticated as the programming of Navy jet fighters, the surroundings in 
some respects resemble little more than a military salvage yard. 
</P>
<P>
Just behind the building is a fenced area holding what appears at first glance 
to be some abandoned Army tanks. In reality, they are four Sgt. York mobile air 
defense units, built for the Army in the early 1980s at a cost of $32 million 
each and then given away when the Sgt. York program was junked because of cost 
overruns and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simulating Soviets 
</P>
<P>
The Electromagnetic Systems Division was attracted to the Sgt. Yorks because 
they resemble Soviet antiaircraft weapons capable of shooting down Navy planes 
and they came with a stabilized optics package and laser equipment that could 
be used at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
Acquiring four of the Army's 82 Sgt. Yorks two years ago for $5,000 each -- the 
cost of moving them from Alabama -- the Navy now uses them routinely at Point 
Mugu in training helicopter and fighter pilots during air-to-ground combat 
simulations and has made considerable highly classified use of the laser and 
optical equipment on board. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Dahl, who seemed happy at the chance to discuss the capacities of the 
F-14D in war games, the head of Point Mugu's Electromagnetic Systems Division, 
Milton Olson, was reluctant to talk about the most important research programs 
now under way in his area of command, 
</P>
<P>
"We do some work with lasers," he said. "That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to showing off the Sgt. York, however, Olson was willing to discuss 
another piece of military hardware recently developed by his engineers for use 
in training U.S. pilots to avoid being hit by heat-seeking missiles during 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracking Flares 
</P>
<P>
In a workroom not far from the Sgt. Yorks, Olson pointed to a long, white tube 
faintly resembling an elongated water heater with a rotating top. 
</P>
<P>
The giant pod, called the Airborne Turret Infrared Measurement System can be 
attached to airplanes. The system, the only one of its kind in the world, has 
become operational in only the last two weeks, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Known as ATIMS III, it is used in testing one of the first and simplest of all 
U.S. aerial warfare countermeasures -- the dropping of highly volatile chemical 
flares by jets to decoy heat-seeking enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with radiation devices and television cameras, the ATIMS III records 
the dropping of flares, which helps Navy engineers determine which flares are 
most effective and is useful in developing tactics that pilots can use when 
being chased by an enemy missile. 
</P>
<P>
Standing beside his new ATIMS III, Olson made the point that -- despite the 
super-sophisticated technology involved in much of the work at Point Mugu -- 
some of the most important programs still come in relatively simple packages. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, heat-seeking missiles were responsible for 90% of the kills on 
both sides," Olson said. "They are a very formidable weapon. Flares have been 
one of the most important countermeasures. They may seem to be a pretty simple 
solution. But they are also very important."

LABOR MEDIATOR HAILED FOR APLOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initially, state mediator Draza Mrvichin doesn't inspire confidence at the 
school districts and cities where he's called to settle labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Ventura resident, who stands 6-4 and weighs 300 pounds, wears 
loud Hawaiian shirts, droopy polyester pants and Birkenstocks. Until recently, 
his briefcase bore a sticker with his favorite saying, which translates roughly 
to: "You must confuse me with someone who cares." 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, you'll wonder, 'What can this guy do for us?' " said David G. 
Miller, a Los Angeles labor attorney who represents five school districts, 
including the Oxnard School District. 
</P>
<P>
But as school districts and cities throughout Southern California have found, 
looks can be deceiving. In a rare consensus, union and management officials 
alike say that nobody is better at jump-starting stalled contract negotiations 
than this 14-year veteran of the California Mediation and Conciliation Service. 
</P>
<P>
Mrvichin (pronounced Merv-itch-in) played referee in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's dispute with 34,000 teachers, whose nine-day strike in May 
paralyzed the nation's second-largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, the Orange Unified School District turned to him when 650 
teachers were walking picket lines with 300 of their students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Strike 
</P>
<P>
He also helped to resolve the Corona Police Department strike of 1983 and the 
Riverside County Sheriff's Department strike of 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"He can settle anything," said his boss, Thomas McCarthy, the mediation 
service's head conciliator in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Mrvichin is also the one who, year in and year out, tends to tussles closer to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he helped Ventura County arrive at a contract settlement with the 
Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County, or PEAVC, just 16 hours before a 
potentially crippling strike. 
</P>
<P>
This week, he was still working on a contract dispute between the city of 
Oxnard, which is in the midst of a budget crisis, and its clerical, 
professional and firefighting personnel, who maintain that the city is 
short-changing them to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mrvichin helped end the most acrimonious contract dispute in 
memory at the Oxnard School District, where teachers had become so exasperated 
with the district's offers that they erected a billboard saying: "Oxnard -- 
Home of Unhappy Teachers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'When It's Important' 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one I call when it's important," Miller said. "Draza's the best in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, he unites about 120 employers and their estranged workers in a big, 
burly bear hug. That means sometimes juggling a dozen cases at once and driving 
30,000 miles a year on business. 
</P>
<P>
Business will no doubt boom. School districts are increasingly strapped. The 
cost of health benefits for teachers is increasing, and so are teachers' salary 
demands, fueled by expectations from Proposition 98, which increased school 
funding by $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mrvichin's approach to conciliation is to ruffle feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Blunt and irreverent, Mrvichin is likely to dare a union to take the step he's 
been called to prevent -- a strike -- or berate the proponents of a settlement 
proposal that he finds the least bit outlandish. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll say, 'Why don't you ask for the key to heaven? Your chances are about as 
great as getting that,' " said Stephen Silver, a Santa Monica labor lawyer who 
represents the Oxnard Firefighters Assn. and other unions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticized for Comments 
</P>
<P>
Tact is not Mrvichin's long suit. He has been criticized in negotiations for 
calling the women present girls. He is notorious for his comments, such as 
telling a county's assistant chief accounting officer that he's so cheap his 
shoes squeak. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not brain surgery, you know," Mrvichin said. 
</P>
<P>
And in rooms where the air hangs heavy with bureaucratese, the former defensive 
lineman for East Los Angeles Community College explains things in terms that 
everybody understands. 
</P>
<P>
He warns city council members that if they stick to their guns on meager 
raises, their workers "won't be happy campers." He tells union officials with 
too lengthy an agenda that he is going to leave until they strip down their 
demands to five. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get excited till I get down to the underwear," Mrvichin said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he loosens tense situations and tries to win the confidence of 
opposing parties. He gives the impression that "he's in charge and you may not 
be as important as you thought you were when you came into the room," one 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a mediator doesn't assert himself, then the parties are still full of 
themselves," said Ed McClain, Ventura County employee relations officer. "You 
can't reach an agreement because you're still convinced how right you are and 
how wrong they are. This puts the situation in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Mrvichin, who worked as a janitor and union organizer before coming to 
mediation, credits his success to an "almost instinctive" ability to bring 
people together. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't analyze what I do or why I do it . . . I just do it," he said. But 
negotiators who have worked with him see nothing haphazard in his approach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becomes a Player 
</P>
<P>
Although most mediators respect the traditional role of referee, shuttling 
settlement proposals between two deeply divided opponents sequestered in 
separate rooms, Mrvichin becomes a player. Negotiators say he is more likely 
than his colleagues to come up with proposals for settlements or present terms 
that already are on the table in such a way that they seem new. 
</P>
<P>
He draws from a hefty bag of tricks. A benefit package or a bonus plan or 
multi-year contract that helped solve a dispute in Orange County one year may 
surface as a possible solution to a dispute in Ventura County the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Miller speaks of how hard Mrvichin once worked to overcome the last hurdle to a 
settlement for teachers in the San Bernardino School District. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-two times he asked me to drop a no-strike clause," Miller said. "He 
hammered and hammered for about 4 1/2 hours on that same issue." In the end, 
Miller's side prevailed, but the experience wasn't soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Elected officials are not spared Mrvichin's withering candor. 
</P>
<P>
"Most mediators are overpowered by elected officials because they tend to lose 
their temper," said Mark Rona, past president of the Orange Unified teachers' 
union, the Orange Unified Education Assn. "He'll say, 'I'll put together a 
package, but you've got to stop messing around.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Divisions 
</P>
<P>
Such was the message he gave Los Angeles school board members in May, 
negotiators from both sides said. Mrvichin told the trustees, who had been 
sharply divided on the amount that teachers should be offered, that they 
themselves would have to agree on a settlement before they could expect to 
reach a resolution. Three school board members had made public statements that 
gave the impression that they would support a larger increase than the board 
was formally offering, prompting the union to hold out, said Richard N. Fisher, 
the district's head negotiator. But four days after the board reached an 
internal accord, the teachers had a contract. 
</P>
<P>
John Britz, chief negotiator for United Teachers-Los Angeles, the Los Angeles 
teachers' union, attributes the settlement to "pressure generated by teachers 
closing down the district" but acknowledges that "Draza forced the school board 
to put aside their personal differences." 
</P>
<P>
Forcing the lions and the lambs to lie together is not easy, but Mrvichin's 
endurance is notorious. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammitt, director of PEAVC, recalls one session in which Mrvichin 
mediated for 43 hours without a break. "People still talk about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And when the only issue left to be resolved in the Orange Unified School 
District's strike was complaints by parents that teachers had encouraged 
students to join them on the picket lines, Mrvichin offered to hear the 
complaints one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"Some mediators have the parties work out agreements themselves," said Steve 
Andelson, a Cerritos attorney who represented the district in the dispute. 
"Mrvichin's philosophy is that if the parties haven't worked out a solution at 
the table, he needs to be more active." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Contract 
</P>
<P>
In the final hours of negotiations on the Oxnard Educators Assn.'s last 
contract, Mrvichin persuaded the union to drop a demand for a premium for 
veteran teachers by pointing out that it would make the union's job that much 
more difficult the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you negotiate for a raise, the district will beat you down because 
they can say, 'Look how much money teachers earn,' " said Mark Prim, head of 
the OEA's negotiating team. Instead, the union agreed to a smaller increase 
shared by its 500 members. 
</P>
<P>
Mrvichin says he got his love of a good dispute from his father, a priest in 
the Serbian Orthodox Church who encouraged lively debate at the dinner table in 
the family's Alhambra home. 
</P>
<P>
But the seeds may have been planted even earlier: Mrvichin's paternal 
grandfather, another Serbian Orthodox priest, was a member of the Black Hand, 
the terrorist group that assassinated Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, touching 
off World War I. 
</P>
<P>
That detail of Mrvichin's lineage will not surprise anyone who has heard him 
describe his favorite pastime. A former college debater, he says he loves to 
argue "just for the sake of arguing" and claims that he can't understand why 
more people don't. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't agree with them," he complained, "it's like you don't like them." 
</P>
<P>
For Mrvichin, haggling at work is not enough. He devotes Saturdays to attending 
garage sales so he can "argue over a quarter or a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Still, nothing beats the heady experience of reaching a settlement, Mrvichin 
said. Even when he stumbles home at 1 or 2 in the morning, he awakens his wife 
of 12 years, Barbara Ann, to savor details with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I really get a kick out of what I do," he said. "There are some mornings when 
I can't wait to get up and at 'em."

MORATORIUM'S EFFECT: 2 PICO HOME SELLERS FACE DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Ascencio answered the front door of her Pico-Fairfax home with a crumpled 
Kleenex in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been crying," she said, with a sad smile. "I'm sick and I'm worried." 
</P>
<P>
As Ascencio sees it, she has everything to lose by a temporary moratorium on 
issuing demolition and building permits in the neighborhood where she has long 
lived. She said she is worried about impending financial ruin because the ban 
has jeopardized the nearly culminated sale of her modest house to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
A week before the escrow closing date, the developer, Kenneth Bank, has 
threatened to renege on the deal if he cannot immediately go forward with plans 
to tear down Ascencio's house and put up an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measure Approved 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved the emergency measure Tuesday without 
discussion by a 12-0 vote. Moments later in a City Hall corridor, Bank said he 
could not comment on whether he was bailing out. Earlier, he had predicted 
that, if passed, the moratorium would reverberate through a city enmeshed in a 
growth-slow growth tug of war. 
</P>
<P>
A distraught Ascencio sat in Councilman Nate Holden's office suite threatening 
to kill herself if her house sale didn't go thorugh, Holden deputy Louis White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium is the first ban on building approved by the council in about 
two years. The city Planning Commission during that time has opposed 
moratoriums as an "inappropriate way of doing land use planning," said 
commission President William Luddy. In certain forms, they have also been 
deemed illegal by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
A week after it was first raised in the City Council, the matter was back with 
the Planning Commission's OK, breakneck speed for such an action to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Holden asked for the moratorium as stop-gap measure until an interim growth 
control measure can be enacted. Holden's 10th District encompasses the 
Pico-Fairfax neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid stalling the measure, Commissioner Theodore Stein yielded to Holden's 
request to change his vote, breaking a tie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought by Homeowners 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was sought by homeowners who banded together to stop a 
developers' run on their racially integrated neighborhood of single-family 
homes, interspersed on some blocks with apartments. Their neighborhood is south 
of Pico Boulevard between Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard. The ban also 
applies to another small patch of the 10th council district near Wilshire and 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Pico-Fairfax homeowners burst into applause in the Council 
Chambers when the measure passed. It requires Mayor Tom Bradley's signature. 
</P>
<P>
While the group exulted in their victory, Ascencio and next-door-neighbor, 
Michael Schwieger, who sold his house in a package deal with Ascencio, 
contemplated financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time as the Pico-Fairfax Good Neighbors Assn. was being 
formed, Ascencio and Schwieger sold their property to Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the right to sell," said Ascencio, a former nurse, who has been a 
housekeeper for the last 12 years. She said her plan was to buy less expensive 
quarters, eliminate mortgage payments and pay off her car in preparation for 
retirement in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
She and Schwieger said it is unfair, and financially disastrous, to them to 
suddenly change the law, while they are in mid-transaction. "If I had known 
what was going to happen six months ago, I would have never sold my home," 
Schwieger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Homes Purchased 
</P>
<P>
During escrow, both have purchased new homes. In Ascencio's case, she has been 
threatened with a lawsuit because she cannot follow through on a contract to 
buy her new house. Ascencio and Schwieger can in turn sue the developer for 
breach of contract; however, that doesn't offer much immediate relief. 
</P>
<P>
As she pads through her two-bedroom home in pink, fluffy slippers, Ascencio 
apologizes for the obstacle course of packed boxes, ready for the move that may 
not materialize. The developer has advanced her $3,000 and she has committed 
herself to purchases to refurbish the house she bought, just east of La Cienega 
Boulevard and south of Rodeo Road. "I already went way too far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwieger, a carpenter and tiler who restores old homes, is in even deeper. He 
took out a temporary loan for a house he has gutted and restored, assuming that 
he could repay the loan once the sale of his old home was completed. He has 
removed light fixtures, the dishwasher and other items from his old home. Last 
weekend, Schwieger had an "estate sale" of antiques to raise one month's loan 
payment on his new house, about 10 blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Since his two pieces of property are cross-collateralized, Schwieger said he 
could lose them both if the sale doesn't go through because he cannot afford 
the mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
Schwieger is a development booster who said apartment buildings with rents in 
the $1,000 a month range will revitalize the neighborhood and give local 
business owners a boost. 
</P>
<P>
After the council meeting, homeowner James Moody countered, "It brings more 
drugs. It brings more thugs too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges of Jealousy 
</P>
<P>
In the hall outside the council chamber, Schwieger confronted leaders of the 
homeowner group, charging them with greed and jealousy because they had 
considered selling but wanted more for their property than developers were 
willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Association President Terry Steinhart said he, and others in the group, are 
motivated by their wish to stay in a desirable neighborhood they can afford. 
"You're doing what you think is best for you and I'm doing what I think is 
right for me," Steinhart told Schwieger. 
</P>
<P>
"He took a calculated risk, " Steinhart said later. "He should only be mad at 
himself and the developer." He pointed out that Ascencio and Schwieger could 
sell their homes to private parties. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, the matter is far from settled. After the council vote Tuesday, an 
attorney for another affected developer branded the moratorium illegal because 
property owners did not receive sufficient warning and had no meaningful 
opportunity to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"The moratorium itself is terribly flawed legally," said Benjamin Reznik. "It 
amounts to basically a taking of property without compensation." 
</P>
<P>
Reznik represents developer Michael Stern, who, after obtaining the proper 
permits, razed a single-family home and excavated for an apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
The demolition further galvanized homeowners who feared that by the time an 
interim development control ordinance could be passed, about four months from 
now, the damage would be done. Reznik outlined his concerns in a letter to City 
Atty. James K. Hahn. The city attorney's office has not approved the legality 
of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ban is for all building permits, the ordinance gives the City 
Council power to grant hardship exemptions, perhaps for a homeowner who wants 
to add a new room, said City Planner Gabriel Robles. 
</P>
<P>
Schwieger said he and his neighbor should qualify too. "They should let people 
already involved in transactions, finish them," he said.

BOARD TO CONSIDER PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-five building projects put on hold when voters passed a growth-management 
initiative in March will be considered by the Board of Directors on Oct. 3 and 
10. 
</P>
<P>
The board must decide which of eight commercial projects can proceed under the 
city's new commercial-construction limit of 250,000 square feet annually. So 
far this year, 54,341 square feet have been allocated, leaving 195,000 square 
feet of allowable development. The eight projects total 262,090 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The 47 residential projects total 310 units. Sixteen units of the annual 
construction limit of 250 have been allocated, leaving 234 remaining units. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed Tuesday that all the projects will be considered under the 
less stringent Phase II requirements of the initiative, even if the properties 
are approved under the 1990 limits with their much stricter Phase III rules. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growth initiative is being challenged by a coalition of community 
groups. Hearings on the suit are not expected for at least six months.

GARBAGE RATES TO GO UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garbage collection rates will continue to go up for residents of single-family 
homes, the City Council decided Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Such customers will continue to absorb semiannual rate increases that the city 
must pay Athens Disposal until subsidies for single-family rates are phased 
out, council members agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's contract with Athens Disposal, the company receives automatic 
rate increases, based on the Consumer Price Index, every June and December. 
These increases have averaged 5% a year, said Dennis Danner, the city's 
administrative services director. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, rates charged to residents of multifamily complexes have been 
higher than those in other San Gabriel Valley communities in order to subsidize 
single-family rates, Danner said. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, the city decided to phase out the subsidy by passing on fee 
increases only to single-family customers. That year, a whopping 21% increase, 
prompted by the closure of the Operating Industries landfill in Monterey Park, 
was shouldered entirely by single-family residents. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, rates for multifamily dwellers are still about 31% higher than those 
in nearby communities, according to a report Danner submitted to the council.

GOLF INJURY CLAIM FILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diamond Bar Councilman Gary Werner is asking the City of Industry to pay him 
for damages he suffered when a golf ball ricocheted off a metal railing and hit 
him in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred July 6 when Werner was practicing hitting golf balls at 
the Industry Hills Golf Course Driving Range. He was rushed by paramedics to 
Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, where he underwent surgery and 
received 21 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the railing is covered with mesh to absorb the impact of stray 
golf balls, Werner said, "at the very end of the range, where I was, there was 
no mesh screen. It was negligence on the city's part." 
</P>
<P>
Werner's attorney, Marc Lebovitz, has filed a claim with the City of Industry 
asking that Werner be compensated for hospital expenses, potential plastic 
surgery and lost wages. Lebovitz said he hadn't calculated the total monetary 
amount but said in the claim it may exceed $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Industry City Atty. Graham Ritchie was unavailable for comment Wednesday.

S. AFRICA POLICY REVISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's South Africa purchasing policy, adopted in May, has been revised 
after city staff members experienced problems implementing it. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Board of Directors adopted revisions suggested by Directors 
Chris Holden and William Paparian. Among the revisions: 
</P>
<P>
Cash purchases under $500 are exempted. Originally, the policy involved all 
city money. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members are allowed to buy products from companies doing business in 
South Africa if all suppliers of the product conduct business there. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases without which the delivery of city services would be seriously 
impeded are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the revisions, Director Paparian said the city has one of the 
strictest South Africa policies in California.

CAT FEEDERS SABOTAGE EFFORTS TO CAPTURE SICK ANIMALS, ACTIVIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CHAWKINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An animal-welfare activist attempting to round up a colony of cats living among 
the rocks at a popular Ventura beach claims that a contingent of cat feeders 
there are trying to sabotage his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked the feeders for cooperation," said Leo Grillo, founder of a 
nonprofit group called DELTA (Dedication and Everlasting Love to Animals), 
which runs three private animal shelters. "Now I'm demanding it. We're playing 
hardball." 
</P>
<P>
Grillo and officials of the state Parks and Recreation Department, which 
controls the beach, said this week that citations will be given to people found 
interfering with the trapping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permission From State 
</P>
<P>
The two-dozen cats who live in the beachside rocks along the Promenade outside 
Ventura's Holiday Inn are sick, and some are dying, Grillo contends. He has 
received permission from state park officials to trap the animals and take them 
to his 150-cat shelter in Acton, where they will live either until they are 
adopted or until they die. 
</P>
<P>
But Grillo said his efforts have been partly foiled by a small crew of people 
who for years have been devoted to feeding the cats. 
</P>
<P>
Since his trapping efforts began last month, Grillo said, cat feeders "have 
been literally shoveling food onto the rocks," apparently in an effort to keep 
the cats away from the morsels inside Grillo's traps. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Price, a spokesman for the department, said the action violates park 
regulations that prohibit the feeding of any animals there. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to let people know that what they're doing is in violation of the 
law," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Food left for the cats has also drawn cockroaches and wharf rats, he said. 
"They're making the area into a little bit of a garbage dump," he said. "We've 
had some complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Grillo and park officials said news stories about the trapping have prompted 
people to abandon kittens on the rocks, in hopes that they will be taken to 
Grillo's high-desert cat sanctuary, rather than the county pound, where they 
would probably be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that newly abandoned cats will be taken to the pound, and he 
claimed that "undercover volunteers" will give authorities information on 
people they find abandoning cats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hunting You Down' 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be hunting you down," Grillo said. "I'll have a literal army 
patrolling." 
</P>
<P>
Cat feeders have contended the animals are not sick, as Grillo claims. They 
view the cats as something of a Ventura institution, and have said they resent 
the intrusion of outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
But Grillo, who so far has trapped seven of the cats, said his veterinarian has 
found evidence of feline leukemia, mange, worms, upper respiratory disease and 
other potentially fatal ailments, most of which he blames on the cats' outdoor 
life.

ANOTHER ELWAY?; 
</P>
<P>
IT MAY BE, BUT GLENDORA HIGH SCHOOL'S J. J. O'LAUGHLIN WANTS TO SUCCEED ON HIS 
OWN RATHER THAN COPY ANY OTHER QUARTERBACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In assessing the football talents of Glendora High School'J. O'Laughlin, it's 
easy to understand why comparisons to John Elway of the Denver Broncos have 
been frequently made. 
</P>
<P>
Both are quarterbacks who wear a 7 on their jerseys; and that's just for 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same type of quarterback as Elway," said Dean Karnoski, O'Laughlin's 
coach at Glendora. "He's basically a drop-back passer with a tremendous passing 
arm, but when he gets in trouble he can scramble." 
</P>
<P>
But the 18-year-old O'Laughlin does not want to be compared with Elway or any 
other quarterback who has ever worn a 7 on his uniform. He prefers to succeed 
on his own merit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to pattern myself after anyone else," O'Laughlin said. "I just 
want to be myself. As the coach always says, I just want to be the best player 
I can be." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the 6-foot-3 and 195-pound senior's best has been good enough to make a 
lasting impression on college scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Super scout Dick Lascola of the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn. said 
of O'Laughlin: "He's got all the tools you look for in a quarterback. He's got 
the size, the arm and the smarts." 
</P>
<P>
Lascola, who rates O'Laughlin as one of the top quarterback prospects in 
talent-rich Southern California, is not the only one who feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
SuperPrep magazine listed him No. 6 among quarterbacks in the nation on its 
preseason All-America squad, and Cal-Hi Sports Week of Sacramento selected 
O'Laughlin as the only quarterback on its preseason all-state first team. 
</P>
<P>
O'Laughlin, who is in his third year as starting quarterback for the Tartans, 
has hardly produced the most impressive passing statistics of any prospect in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
He completed only 80 of 209 passes for 1,240 yards and seven touchdowns as a 
sophomore, and improved to 86 of 178 for 1,450 yards and six TDs last season. 
In his first game as a senior against South Hills last week, he was six of 11 
for 106 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But Karnoski says those statistics are a little deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't gotten a lot of help from his receivers," he said. "We probably 
dropped 400 to 500 yards worth of passes last year that were in the kids' 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
The coach hopes that a better receiving corps and a more balanced offense this 
season will make things easier for O'Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the receivers was noticeable in the team's first game, 
Karnoski said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, we restructured our passing game to enable (the receivers) to 
catch the ball a little more effectively," Karnoski said. "Plus, our kids are a 
little better receivers. They have a real desire to succeed at that this year." 
</P>
<P>
It also helps to have a better rushing attack, led by juniors Bill Zernickow 
and Bobby Baeza, which helps explain why O'Laughlin threw only 11 passes 
against South Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely takes some of the pressure off," O'Laughlin said. "It's a 
delight to see when you have great running backs behind you and a good 
offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
However, to understand why O'Laughlin is considered a big-time prospect in the 
eyes of recruiters, one has to look beyond his statistics. Karnoski said he has 
noticed improvement in his quarterback's passing skills. 
</P>
<P>
"The improvement I see is (that) he now has the ability to alter his touch on 
the football," the coach said. "He can pass it harder or softer depending on 
what the situation warrants. He also has a much better understanding of 
opposing defenses and how to read them." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, O'Laughlin is cool and collected, and displays leadership ability 
that would make a brigadier general envious. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to present as much calm and leadership as I can on the field and keep 
the offense moving," O'Laughlin said. "There's a lot of times when it gets so 
intense on the field, and I have to keep us moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be a leader. I like to be in a situation where (teammates) look up to 
me. But I was in the other situation when I was a sophomore, and now they look 
to me in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Karnoski said O'Laughlin has been a good model for the rest of the players on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He does whatever we ask him, whenever we ask him," Karnoski said. "He works 
real hard in practice and in games. That comes from his tremendous competitive 
spirit. He always wants to be a winner in whatever he does." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the coach admits, the competitive nature of O'Laughlin can be his 
own worst enemy, such as a play in the South Hills game when he fumbled after 
attempting to scramble away from a pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
"His biggest weakness is his competitiveness," Karnoski said. "You can't be a 
quarterback and expect every play to work or to be a miracle worker." 
</P>
<P>
But that is one of the few complaints you will hear about O'Laughlin. More 
often you will hear Karnoski admiring the player's all-around athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
In prep football, O'Laughlin has played primarily at quarterback and has also 
seen duty as a punter and safety. He was not always a quarterback, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play quarterback until my freshman year in high school," he said. "In 
youth ball, I played linebacker and tight end. When I was a youth, my best 
sport was probably baseball." 
</P>
<P>
O'Laughlin has also been a starter in basketball and baseball for the Tartans. 
Last season, he averaged 10 points and five rebounds as a starting forward in 
basketball and batted .382 as a shortstop and third baseman in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He was the second-leading scorer on a basketball team that reached the state 
Division II final last season. Of course, he admits it may not sound that 
impressive when you consider that the leading scorer -- All-American Tracy 
Murray -- averaged 44.3. 
</P>
<P>
With all of his sports, O'Laughlin doesn't have a lot of time to dawdle. Still, 
he finds the time to serve as an officer in Interact, a community service 
organization sponsored by the Glendora Rotary Club, and carries a 3.5 
cumulative grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much time to do much else," he said. "I like doing all the 
sports, though, and I wouldn't have it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
He credits a lot of his success to his parents and two older brothers, who have 
helped guide him through the years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lot easier because of the support I get from my parents and 
brothers," he said. "They've helped me through it all. My parents are the ones 
that taught me to concentrate on my grades -- that it would be important down 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
Considering his all-around ability, both on and off the field, it is probably 
not surprising to hear that he has received recruiting letters from more than 
100 colleges. He said 15 to 20 appear to be the most interested, including all 
of the Pacific 10 Conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
O'Laughlin said he is a long way from deciding what college he will attend, 
although he wants to stay on the West Coast. He also prefers a school that also 
allows him to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, he would prefer to set his sights on the rest of the 
football season. He has already left a lasting impression on college scouts.

AZUSA PACIFIC AND OCCIDENTAL SEEK THEIR FIRST WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The football teams at Azusa Pacific University and Occidental entered the 
season with high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
But both teams will enter their Saturday non-conference match-up at 1:30 p.m. 
in Azusa still looking for their first win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, which had been ranked No. 22 in the first National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics Division II poll, suffered a 24-6 defeat to the 
University of San Diego last week and Occidental lost to Menlo, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
In its loss to San Diego, Azusa struggled on offense with only 133 total yards 
and coach Jim Milhon said the Cougars were hurt by mental mistakes on defense. 
However, two players who turned in outstanding games on defense were 
linebackers Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental was led on offense against Menlo by running back Steve McClaskey, a 
former player for Azusa Pacific who rushed for 109 yards and one touchdown. 
Another leader for Occidental is quarterback Tony Werbelow, who played at 
Arcadia High.

LARGER ROLE IN THE SCHOOL IS WORTH LONGER HOURS, TEACHERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at Hillside Junior High School in Simi Valley aren't likely to 
complain about the hiring of Kathy Scroggin, the woman selected this summer to 
be their new principal. That's because they chose her. They also picked their 
new assistant principal, Steve Kalan. 
</P>
<P>
At Conejo Elementary School in nearby Thousand Oaks, the faculty had a say in 
hiring two new teachers, a custodian and the office secretary. Teachers there 
also want to replace state-mandated special education classes with their own 
method of teaching the school's educationally and emotionally handicapped 
students. 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles school administrators begin this fall to share for the first 
time some of their power with faculty and community members, staff members at 
Hillside and Conejo say the transition is unlikely to be easy. But they say the 
results are worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Project 
</P>
<P>
Now in the fifth year of a five-year pilot project that allows teachers a much 
larger voice in running their schools, teachers at those schools say they have 
paid for their increased power with more work and longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
They said extensive training and seasoning are required to make the 
power-sharing work. Their ideas have been turned down by district authorities 
at least twice. And a handful of colleagues have decided not to participate, 
saying that they would rather not be bothered with more duties than they 
already have. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of the teachers, who formerly had near total control in their 
classrooms but next to none outside of it, the experiment has provided a new 
appreciation for what they can accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't give up the power and neither would others who are seriously 
involved in the project," said Denise Byrnes, a Hillside teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The two eastern Ventura County schools are among 26 in the nation -- and the 
only two in California -- taking part in the National Education Assn.'s Mastery 
in Learning project. Officials from the NEA, the nation's largest teachers 
union, as well as administrators in the Simi Valley and Conejo Valley unified 
school districts, will evaluate the project's results next spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Schools 
</P>
<P>
The NEA helped the participating schools raise money from private foundations 
to help support the training of teachers, as well as the educational research 
needed to implement changes sought by the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Project consultant Bob McClure said the NEA's goal was to allow teachers at 
each of the schools to decide for themselves what changes to make in 
instruction. But the union offered virtually no guidelines about what issues 
teachers should take up. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to extend the leash and see what the faculty could do with their 
school," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one measure, test scores of the California Assessment Program, shows 
that significant academic improvement occurred at both schools during the past 
three years. Hillside, for example, moved from last to first among Simi 
Valley's four junior high schools in the reading and writing portions of the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be difficult to really explain the increases but we have to assume 
that something was happening at the school to make a difference," said Robert 
Isenberg, the Simi Valley district's director of testing. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the districts allow the teachers to retain expanded decision-making 
powers or broaden the program to other schools will depend largely on what 
happens this year, district officials and teachers said. At both schools, 
teachers hope that parents and students will give good reviews to the teachers' 
experimental classroom programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Time 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of the outcome of those evaluations, local teachers union 
representatives say it is only a matter of time before greater management 
powers become a common element in teachers' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the wave of the future," said Hal Vick, executive director of the Simi 
Educators Assn. and the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking raises, teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District went on strike for nine days last spring to win the power to overrule 
school principals in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
But even though he supports the Mastery in Learning project, William Seaver, 
Conejo Valley district superintendent, is skeptical about granting teachers 
similar powers in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good management for the principal to work with teachers but the 
principal has to have the ultimate authority," Seaver said. "There are areas of 
responsibility that the administration has and I don't see any strong need to 
change those." 
</P>
<P>
Seaver said teachers in his district have for many years had a say in school 
management through their membership with parents and administrators on school 
councils. Traditionally, however, those councils have lacked power over the 
most important of school decisions -- those involving budgets, curricula and 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the district has relinquished power to teachers in even those areas, 
teachers are using it to address what they see as key issues at their schools. 
NEA officials said most of the 26 schools in the program chose to address 
curricular issues, but some, as at Hillside, have made key personnel changes 
and even adopted changes in school budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Power 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, principals at both California schools in the NEA project, as well 
as school board members, retain the power to veto any faculty idea. But 
teachers say they also have real power because they behave as if they do. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal has the final say and I'm not reluctant to use it," said Neil 
Snyder, Conejo Elementary School principal. But he said he uses his veto power 
only after discussing the issue with teachers. "The era of one guy leading the 
posse is over." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder has, for example, worked with teachers to raise money for major school 
repairs and renovations, one of the top priorities adopted by the faculty after 
joining the NEA program. They worked together and were successful on that 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
But even the principal's endorsement doesn't always guarantee success. The 
teachers at Conejo, for example, have learned some hard lessons over their plan 
to allow the school's 20 or so educationally and emotionally handicapped 
students to spend most of their classroom hours with regular students. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing special education students with regular students is not completely new. 
Special education students already mix with regular students in single subjects 
such as reading and physical education. But teachers at Conejo proposed 
restructuring the entire fifth and sixth grades so that special education 
students and their teachers would join regular classes for all the basic 
subjects, such as math and English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduce Class Size 
</P>
<P>
The idea, according to the teachers who proposed it, would allow special 
education students a chance to mingle with regular students and would reduce 
class size for all students. Teachers would share teaching duties, each giving 
lessons in the subjects they know most about. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the students have expressed some concerns," said special education 
teacher Marsha Siever. "But most said they wanted to be with the regular kids." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the parents in the grades affected by the proposal were in favor 
of it. And teachers said they believed that they had the go-ahead for beginning 
the restructuring this fall. But district officials told the teachers in August 
that state law requires the plan to be approved by the local and state boards 
of education. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to mainstream children with special needs into other classes, but 
the concern is that in special education classes you have teachers with very 
specific skills," Supt. Seaver said. "You don't want the children to lose 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Conejo Elementary say they are preparing a formal proposal on the 
idea to present to the school board. They said they are optimistic that the 
board will approve it in time for the restructuring to occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
At Hillside, teachers last year also met obstacles when they proposed opening 
school a week early and adding additional vacation days during the year. A 
majority of the school's parents opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But the faculty got no opposition to a new program that this year will change 
the way 120 seventh-graders are taught at the school. Those students, instead 
of going to separate English, science, history and math classes, will stay in 
the same classroom and their teachers will come to them. The change allows 
teachers to combine lessons in different subjects and to schedule two- and 
three-hour blocks of time for instruction instead of the traditional one-hour 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"The history teacher starts the year teaching the fall of the Roman Empire, and 
I can be teaching Greek and Roman mythology," said Hillside English teacher 
Kimberly Lee. "The difference here is that teachers don't have to be in 
complete isolation from each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Time 
</P>
<P>
Teachers put in extra time, routinely meeting two and three times a week to 
discuss such projects. Grants from the nonprofit Stuart Foundation of San 
Francisco have paid for substitutes to take over classes when teachers attend 
meetings and training sessions, and for some overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the teachers interviewed at both schools say that since the program 
began they have routinely put in extra hours without pay. They are motivated to 
work harder, they said, because their ideas are taken seriously by school 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The extra work put in by teachers, as well as the improved test scores, 
persuaded Simi Valley Supt. John Duncan to approve a request last year by 
Hillside teachers to hire their new principal and vice principal. Duncan also 
approved a request by teachers to draw up a plan to further expand their power 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some suspicion, some fear of the unknown when this started," Duncan 
said. "It was the NEA and no one was sure what the desired outcome was." But 
apparently, he said, the goal was "more enthusiastic and effective teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Former NEA project consultant Joyce Tambor, now a professor of education at Cal 
State Northridge, said the experiment's purpose has been to show that school 
staff members know best which programs will work for their students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far From Classroom 
</P>
<P>
The problem with much school reform, Tambor said, is that it originates far 
from the classroom.

WOMAN PLANS TO WED SALCIDO

<P>
A Los Angeles woman said she and accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido plan to 
wed and hope they can care for his remaining child, Carmina. Barbara Pater, 28, 
an investigator of missing persons, told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat that 
Salcido "wants people to know that it was not 'him' that did this; that it was 
something else that did it." Salcido is charged with slaying his wife, two 
children, his mother-in-law, two of her other daughters, and a co-worker during 
a bloody rampage in the Sonoma County wine country last April. Pater said she 
and Salcido often speak about living with Carmina, his remaining daughter, 3, 
who was found in a garbage dump with her throat slashed, her two sisters dead 
beside her.

Tibetan courts have sentenced 10 people to prison terms of up to life on 
charges of rioting and spying for the Dalai Lama during an anti-Chinese 
uprising in March, China's official New China News Agency reported. Among those 
sentenced were four former Tibetan monks who received terms ranging from three 
to five years, the news agency said. The rioting in Lhasa, the capital of the 
Himalayan region, was the latest in a series of major outbreaks since violent 
protests against Chinese rule erupted in September, 1987. By official count, 16 
people were killed in the three days of disturbances, although Tibetans say 
that between 20 and 30 died.

Children's author Dr. Seuss is under attack by logging families in a rural 
Northern California town who want his 1971 classic, "The Lorax," axed as 
required reading for their children. A special committee of the Laytonville 
Unified School District is considering a complaint that the book "criminalizes" 
tree-cutting. The committee will make a recommendation to the school board. 
Teachers of the Mendocino County community, for the second year and with board 
approval, placed "The Lorax" -- which criticizes the destruction of the Earth's 
forests -- on its required reading list for second graders. But Judith Baily, 
whose husband, Bill, is a logging equipment wholesaler, filed a complaint with 
the district demanding that the book be, at least, downgraded to optional 
reading. Dr. Seuss, 85, an award-winning children's author whose real name is 
Theodor Geisel, and his publisher, Random House, have had no comment on the 
matter.

More than 61,000 "boat people" fled Vietnam in the first eight months of this 
year, a figure higher than in any full year since 1981, and Hong Kong is 
bearing the brunt of the influx, a U.N. group said. The Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees registered 61,345 arrivals in countries of first 
asylum in Southeast Asia and Japan from January through August, just before 
seasonal conditions traditionally slow down the exodus. The outflow compared to 
45,500 for last year and 74,000 in 1981. Hong Kong reported 32,000 arrivals 
during the first eight months.

Israel's inner Cabinet discussed an Egyptian plan to end the stalemate in the 
occupied territories, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected the proposal, 
saying it would not help Israel achieve peace with the Arabs. He also dismissed 
reports that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is seeking to arrange 
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo. Shamir told reporters in Tel Aviv: "In my 
opinion, it (Mubarak's peace plan) cannot help us." In Tunis, Tunisia, 
Palestine Liberation Organization officials said only that they have 
reservations about the plan.

President Bush sent Congress legislation to provide tax breaks to parents who 
adopt children who are difficult to place for reasons such as physical or 
mental handicaps or age. Bush, who has an adopted grandchild of his own, said 
there are 30,000 "special-needs" children available for adoption. Bush's plan 
would provide a $3,000 tax deduction to families for costs incurred in adopting 
a special-needs child. A separate bill would provide additional benefits for 
federal employees who adopt such children. In a four-year program, the 
employees would be eligible for reimbursement of up to $2,000.

Showers and thunderstorms soaked the south-central United States, inundating 
parts of Oklahoma and prompting weather officials to warn of "life-threatening" 
floods. Meanwhile, a cold front produced record freezing temperatures in 
Colorado and Nebraska. Residents also braced for the possibility of flash 
flooding in parts of northern and western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. 
The National Weather Service said more than 6 inches of rain fell overnight at 
Yukon, Okla., and flooding was widespread across central Oklahoma. Weather 
officials recommended evacuation of parts of Guthrie, Okla., and issued a flash 
flood watch for the southeastern sections of the state. In Denver, record cold 
set a temperature mark for the day with 33 degrees, shattering the 34-degree 
mark set in 1898. In Nebraska, Scottsbuff bested the 1949 mark by 1 degree with 
29 degrees.

YURI SIMONOV IN BOWL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appreciative audience officially tabulated at 11,205 encountered good news 
and bad news at Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The good news? The management had managed to engage Yuri Simonov, one of the 
finest conductors in the Soviet Union, to make his U.S. orchestral debut 
replacing Andre Previn on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news? Simonov had to make do with a strange repertory grab-bag selected 
by and for our hastily departed music director. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program posed no special problems. Resplendent in the 
Old-World formality of black tails rather than the usual New-World casualness 
of a white dinner-jacket, Simonov opened the festivities with the most dramatic 
reading of "The Star-Spangled Banner" in memory. Lending new meaning to the 
concept of perestroika, our Soviet guest whipped through our national anthem as 
if lives were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Next he dispatched Tchaikovsky's "Marche Slave" with passion that verged on 
frenzy. He all but dared the Los Angeles Philharmonic not to follow his 
precisely manicured urgings. 
</P>
<P>
Then he provided a fast and fluent, decidedly unsentimental though subtly 
nuanced orchestral frame for Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto. He may have 
unnerved Jeffrey Kahane in the process, for the talented young soloist gave a 
performance more notable for introspection than for accuracy or fluency. Still, 
this was Simonov on musical terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
The terra proved far less firma after intermission. Simonov tried desperately, 
touchingly, to validate the all-American charms and rigors of "Appalachian 
Spring." Unfortunately, the gift to be simple with Copland eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the supreme vulgarity of Ravel's "La Valse," Simonov mistook 
soulful brio for Gallic glitter. His reading had undeniable sweep and splashy 
color in its favor, but not the wonted refinement of line and subtlety of 
inflection. 
</P>
<P>
This simply was a case of heroic miscasting, the obvious troubles compounded by 
insufficient rehearsal. Simonov is capable of musical marvels. Anyone who heard 
him conduct the Bolshoi Opera at the Met in 1975 knows that. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. There still is hope. Tonight -- same time, same place -- he will 
turn to standard challenges of Beethoven and Mendelssohn plus a mighty matter 
of native honor: Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique."

'MY DAD' NOT UP TO PAST 'SPECIALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's "Afterschool Specials" tackle some heavy issues. Past episodes of the 
Emmy-winning dramatic series for children haven't flinched from date rape, 
racism, alcoholism, drug abuse and adult illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the series respects viewers' intelligence enough to pose hard questions 
and avoid easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened to today's by-the-numbers, under-wrought season opener? 
</P>
<P>
In "My Dad Can't Be Crazy . . . Can He?," at 3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42, the issue is schizophrenia and its effect on a family when the illness is 
denied and untreated. 
</P>
<P>
Written and directed by Joanna Lee, and based on the works of children's 
novelist Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, the film centers around high school sophomore 
Nick (Wil Wheaton of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"). Nick quickly makes good 
friends in the town to which his family has just relocated. He's 
super-wholesome and well-adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
This is surprising because at home Nick's unemployed father (Don Murray) has 
paranoid fantasies that Mom (Loretta Swit) ignores; the move to a new apartment 
is just one of many the family has been forced to make because of Dad. It's not 
clear how they manage financially; Mom just gives piano lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with believability extend to the cast. Swit isn't convincing as she 
pretends familial normality while Dad accuses his son of being a spy for 
"them"; she's too strong a presence. Murray is allowed no subtlety and thus 
elicits no sympathy. Through it all, Wheaton displays a remarkably unfurrowed 
brow. 
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia is a common but misunderstood mental illness that affects an 
estimated one in 100 Americans. It often goes untreated, and financial and 
support resources are limited. That's the message here, but there's not enough 
depth to give it real impact.

MURDOCH BIDS $1.8 BILLION FOR MGM/UA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an 11th-hour move, two companies controlled by Rupert Murdoch have bid $1.8 
billion for MGM/UA Communications Co., which was slated to merge in two weeks 
with Qintex, an Australian company. If Murdoch's slightly higher bid succeeds, 
he would control two major Hollywood studios that together captured nearly 22% 
of the box office in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA said that its directors will meet today to consider the offer, made 
jointly by News Corp. Ltd. and Fox Inc., the parent of rival film studio 20th 
Century Fox Film Corp. MGM/UA is being pressed for an answer within 24 hours, 
according to one executive familiar with the bid. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute maneuver is reminiscent of Paramount Communications' surprise 
bid for Time Inc. in June as that company was about to merge with Warner 
Communications Inc. The Paramount bid was ultimately defeated, but it 
intensified the current wave of consolidation in the media and entertainment 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
And Murdoch's bid provided fresh evidence -- if Hollywood needed any -- that 
fraternal courtesies are fast disappearing. Just four months ago, after Qintex 
announced its deal with MGM/UA, Murdoch gave a party for Qintex Chairman 
Christopher C. Skase to introduce him to the creative community. "Everybody in 
town was there," a rival studio executive recalled Wednesday, adding cynically: 
"Welcome to the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's immediate fate will be determined by 72-year-old financier Kirk 
Kerkorian, who has controlled MGM for the last two decades and acquired United 
Artists in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MGM Stripped of Assets 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Kerkorian has stripped historic MGM of many assets, including 
the MGM studio lot and film library. But he has also bought back some assets, 
such as the MGM name and "roaring lion" logo, which he planned to repurchase 
again from Qintex. MGM/UA shareholders were scheduled to vote Sept. 23 on the 
Qintex deal. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch's offer, if accepted, would end Kerkorian's whimsical 20-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
According to an internal MGM/UA memo circulated Wednesday, News Corp. and Fox 
indicated that they "intend to operate the MGM/UA businesses aggressively," 
which would mean MGM/UA's survival as a major film distributor, one insider 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
To Murdoch-watchers, the last-minute bid underscores his commitment to 
obtaining more programming for his far-flung media and entertainment holdings, 
which include Sky Television, a British satellite-fed television service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Long-Term Move' 
</P>
<P>
"Financially, it's a very expensive move. Strategically, its a very good 
long-term move," said John Tinker, a securities analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; 
Co. in New York. "News Corp. believes that there is an increase in demand 
worldwide for (programming). The best way to meet that is to make more movies 
and to keep building an international distribution pipeline such as Sky 
Television." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch "has an insatiable appetite for these properties," said one Wall Street 
trader, and another securities analyst declared: "He's like a shark. He can't 
sleep." Both men, who asked not to be identified, said they believe Murdoch may 
be paying too much. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's sale has been expected for nearly 18 months, ever since the company 
announced that it had received offers from Weintraub Entertainment Group and a 
family partnership led by former Fox owner Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
After that announcement, a number of companies looked over the MGM/UA assets -- 
including every major studio, with the exception of Columbia Pictures. From 
other continents, the interested parties included Polygram, Sony and C. Itoh 
&amp; Co., but MGM/UA eventually settled on Qintex's offer to pay $20 for each 
share of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Put at $1.6 Billion 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's offer is valued at about $1.6 billion, including the assumption of 
$400 million in MGM/UA debt, but the Australian firm would actually spend 
closer to $600 million after reselling certain MGM assets to Kerkorian. 
</P>
<P>
The two offers are difficult to compare, because Murdoch would acquire the 
entire company by paying $23.16 for each share of common stock, while Qintex 
has offered just $20 a share but intended to sell back certain assets. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's stock rose $1.50 to close at $21.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 734,700 shares changing hands. News Corp., which was not identified as the 
bidder until late Wednesday, lost 12.5 cents a share to close at $25 on the New 
York exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex has been plagued by rumors that it was having difficulty arranging 
financing for its MGM/UA deal, but the company announced just last week that it 
had obtained a $400-million commitment from its bankers. In addition to owning 
an Australian television network, Qintex operates resorts and holds a 
controlling stake in a Los Angeles TV production company that scored a hit last 
season with the miniseries "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antitrust Worries Cited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, after MGM/UA spurned a lower Murdoch bid, it disclosed that 
it had haggled with Fox over which side would assume the risk if the deal 
collapsed beneath antitrust objections. 
</P>
<P>
Fox apparently has not been deterred by antitrust concerns. The Justice 
Department objected 10 years ago to Kerkorian's purchase of a 25% stake in 
Columbia Pictures, but it lost in court. (Later, Kerkorian sold the Columbia 
investment.) Since that case, the Justice Department has allowed two other 
studio mergers to go through without a murmur. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the federal government) will let it go, but they shouldn't," said one 
antitrust specialist, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
According to data compiled by Daily Variety analyst A. D. Murphy, Fox ranked 
third at the box office last year with 11.6% of ticket sales, and MGM/UA ranked 
fifth, with a 10.3% share. Together, the two studios would have captured the 
top ranking from Walt Disney Co., which accounted for 19.4% of box office 
receipts in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 4, Fox had slipped to seventh place with a 6.4% stake, and MGM/UA 
has garnered just 3.7% of box office receipts, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Chairman Skase could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but the 
company's chief financial officer, John Lloyd, said it is weighing its 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Cancel Merger 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that, unless it raises its bid, Qintex's options are few. Under 
the terms of the agreement, MGM/UA may cancel the merger if it finds a more 
"financially advantageous transaction," so long as it pays Qintex a fee of 
$18.2 million -- less than the $20-million bonus that Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the 
MGM/UA chairman, is set to receive if the company is sold. 
</P>
<P>
For MGM/UA's hundreds of employees, the Murdoch announcement was just one more 
jolt in their roller-coaster ride since the company went on the auction block 
18 months ago. If the Murdoch bid is accepted, "Fox would have direct operating 
control of the company within 60 days to 90 days," according to the MGM/UA 
internal memo. 
</P>
<P>
One insider reacted cautiously: "They're telling everybody in the company that 
(Fox is) intending to run the company, but who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Others were more skeptical, citing similar promises when MGM acquired United 
Artists and when Columbia Pictures merged with Tri-Star Pictures. In both 
cases, autonomy was reduced and jobs were lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard that before at Columbia and with MGM/UA," the antitrust specialist 
said.

CITY TREASURER AND AIDES DRAW SHARP CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, in some of the most blistering passages 
of his report on the Tom Bradley investigation, accused the city treasurer and 
his top aides Wednesday of repeatedly lying to investigators and concealing 
crucial documents that linked the mayor to efforts by Far East National Bank to 
obtain city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the evidence of evasiveness, falsehoods, fabrication and efforts to 
suppress evidence," the report concluded, "are extremely damaging and appear to 
taint everyone and everything that is associated with the events of March 22, 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds Deposited 
</P>
<P>
It was on that date that $2 million in taxpayer funds was deposited with Far 
East after Bradley had a telephone conversation with City Treasurer Leonard 
Rittenberg about the city's relationship with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's report, however, said there was no evidence that Bradley played a role 
in what the city attorney described as "the convoluted and deceptive behavior 
of some of the treasurer's office personnel." He did not speculate on what 
motivated their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn alleged that Rittenberg himself failed to disclose the existence of two 
documents that represented important evidence in the city attorney's probe of 
whether the mayor had used his official position to assist Far East. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a January, 1988, letter from Far East President Henry Hwang to 
Bradley -- only weeks after the mayor became a paid adviser to the bank -- 
asking for help in obtaining city deposits. Bearing the notation "RUSH," the 
letter was sent to Rittenberg by a Bradley aide. The letter directed that a 
response be prepared for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The Hahn report said that Rittenberg also withheld from city attorney's 
officials his own response to the letter, which stated that a treasurer's 
office employee would "personally" assist the bank with required paper work to 
seek city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Far East received a $1-million deposit from the city -- even 
though it did not offer the greatest rate of return among other banks competing 
for the funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silent on Letters 
</P>
<P>
Although Rittenberg was aware of the two letters, he did not reveal their 
existence when first interviewed by the city attorney's office in early April, 
1989, Hahn's report said. Rittenberg claimed nonetheless that he was providing 
investigators with all records pertaining to Far East maintained in his office, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"When asked to explain his non-disclosure of and failure to provide copies of 
Far East National Bank documents, Rittenberg gave no less than five separate 
and contradictory explanations," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
One one occasion, it recounted, the treasurer said, "I didn't think it (one of 
the letters) was germane." On another, he said, "You didn't ask about it." And 
he volunteered this: "I'm not trying to hide anything from you. I mean, I'm 
hoping that you're on my side. Now maybe that's an illusion that I have. I 
don't think we're supposed to be opponents here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioner's Concerns 
</P>
<P>
While questioning Rittenberg, Deputy City Atty. Kevin T. Ryan expressed 
concerns he had about the treasurer's failure to reveal the existence of the 
response he had prepared for the mayor to the Far East letter: 
</P>
<P>
"One, that it impaired our investigation. Two, it causes me to be suspect and 
critical of other documents we're getting from the (treasurer's) department. 
And the last part is . . . your explanation of why that letter wasn't revealed 
to us doesn't hold up." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg: "I understand." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan: "And I assume what happened was that you spoke to somebody and they said, 
bury that or sit on that for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rittenberg did not respond directly to Ryan's scenario, he later 
explained: "Just let it be said that I'm in a very funny position on this whole 
thing. I'm damned from the moment this happened and I have to live with that. . 
. . I'm sorry you're finding some inconsistencies with me." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg further contradicted himself on the issue of whether he found the 
letters in his office files before or after he was first interviewed by the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to Hahn's report, he found them on the day he ordered that 
$2 million be deposited in Far East -- and after he was questioned by a 
reporter about the mayor's relationship to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gage Shown Documents 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg told investigators that he showed the documents to Deputy Mayor 
Michael Gage, who had requested that Rittenberg provide him with a history of 
the city's dealings with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Gage, in interviews with reporters, has said only that Rittenberg provided him 
with a chronology of city deposits with Far East. He never mentioned that the 
treasurer also provided him with the two critical letters. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Rittenberg was interviewed on five separate occasions for a total of 
more than 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's report also blasted efforts by the treasurer's office to cover up 
circumstances surrounding the Far East deposits on March 22, which included 
doctoring documents and obscuring with white correction fluid a notation that 
the money had been deposited "per the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn characterized the statements of Rittenberg and two subordinates -- William 
Hoss and George Sehlmeyer -- as "evasive, deceptive and/or false." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid Sheet Falsified 
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed recently that a so-called "bid sheet" was falsified to make it 
appear as though the Far East deposit had been made through a required 
competitive bidding process, when in fact none had occurred. Other banks were 
listed on the document after the deposit already had been awarded to Far East. 
</P>
<P>
When Rittenberg was first questioned about the falsified document, he claimed 
that he had never seen it before and had no idea what had been "whited out." In 
later interviews, however, Rittenberg admitted that he not only was familiar 
with the document, but had directed his subordinate Hoss to list the other 
banks on it. He also conceded that he knew that the phrase "per the mayor" had 
been obscured. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's assessment of the treasurer's office was harsh. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of the treasurer office's general operation and some of its claimed 
policies show an operation, in some respects, in poor working order: co-workers 
who hate one another operating for years in close proximity while performing 
interrelated functions . . . the doctoring of the bid sheet by adding 
ostensible competitive bids after-the-fact . . . the attempt to conceal and 
suppress evidence by the application of white-out and black ink to the bid 
sheet . . . and a pattern of false and evasive statements to investigators, 
done at the direction of and/or acquiescence of the department head, Treasurer 
Rittenberg." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Probe 
</P>
<P>
At Bradley's direction, the city Personnel Department is investigating 
Rittenberg. Hahn disclosed Wednesday that the treasurer's office also is under 
investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-picked by the mayor, Rittenberg has been the city's treasurer for two 
years, overseeing 54 employees who control the investment of nearly $2 billion 
in taxpayer money. As of last January, he earned an annual salary of $83,416. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer serves at the pleasure of the mayor and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to contact him Wednesday were unsuccessful.

SALVADOR REBELS DEMAND MAJOR REFORMS FOR PEACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Salvador's leftist guerrillas Wednesday handed the government a sweeping 
proposal for an indefinite cease-fire in exchange for major political reforms 
to bring an end to their country's decade-long civil war by next February. 
</P>
<P>
The three-phase plan -- the most detailed offer by either side since the war 
began -- calls for a new Supreme Court, attorney general and Legislative 
Assembly but would leave in place the right-wing government of President 
Alfredo Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also want reform of the constitution and military and government 
prosecution in human rights cases, particularly the 1980 assassination of the 
archbishop of San Salvador, Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo Romero. In turn, the rebels 
would disarm and form a legal political party to compete in elections. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Villalobos and Schafik Handal, two of the five commanders of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, outlined the proposal at a news 
conference in Mexico City before entering their first peace talks with the 3 
1/2-month-old Cristiani government. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking the government of the republic to step down (or that 
Cristiani) give up the legitimacy he says he obtained through elections," 
Villalobos said. "What we are asking is that, for the sake of peace, it be put 
to a test." 
</P>
<P>
The government delegates, led by the minister of the presidency, retired Col. 
Juan Antonio Martinez Varela, and Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, declined 
to comment on the rebel offer. 
</P>
<P>
However, El Salvador's ambassador to Mexico, Sigfrido Montes Cruz, criticized 
the rebels for making their proposal public, saying it was "a form of 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The government was clearly unprepared for such a broad guerrilla plan and 
brought a smaller procedural proposal calling for two-day meetings every two 
months to be held alternately in Mexico, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Guatemala. 
The government plan would bar mediators and observers. 
</P>
<P>
Santamaria described the nine-hour meeting as "positive" and said the 
government is satisfied with the results. In a separate press conference, 
however, the rebels complained about the government's insistence on procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to discuss something more than whether we sit at a round or a 
square table," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, at a Mexican government complex in the capital, is to resume 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The previous government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte met three times with 
the guerrillas but reached no accords. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas' new proposal does not call for direct power-sharing or an 
integration of the rebel and government armies -- two issues that were major 
stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Duarte government. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the proposal outlines such a fundamental restructuring of the 
Salvadoran government and society that it is likely to be rejected by 
hard-liners in Cristiani's Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party) and by 
conservative sectors of the powerful military. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gambling on U.S. Stance 
</P>
<P>
The rebels apparently are gambling that the Bush Administration is looking for 
a way out of the Salvadoran conflict and will find the plan workable. Their 
proposal emphasizes judicial reform, which the Bush Administration sees as key 
to ending the war. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has spent more than $3 billion to support the Salvadoran 
government against the Marxist-led guerrillas. The aid has prevented a rebel 
military victory, but the war is stalemated. U.S. officials estimate that the 
guerrillas still have 6,000 full-time combatants, plus an unknown number of 
part-time militia and civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel plan calls for negotiating a cease-fire by Nov. 15 involving eight 
issues, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Initiation of judicial reform. The government and current opposition 
parties would have to agree on a new attorney general and members of the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prosecution of members of the so-called "death squads" believed to be 
responsible for killing Romero and thousands of students, church and union 
leaders in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Implementation of the agrarian reform program begun by the Duarte 
government, and a halt to current court cases that would reverse the land 
reform already carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An agreement to advance the date of the 1991 municipal and legislative 
elections. A new Legislative Assembly would then vote to ratify constitutional 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The "self-purification" of the armed forces, and security guarantees from 
the military that would be verified by observers from the United Nations and 
Organization of American States. The cease-fire proposal effectively drops a 
previous rebel demand to recognize guerrilla-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said we are willing to integrate ourselves into the political life of 
the nation, understanding that if the causes for the war cease to exist, then 
there is no sense to remaining armed," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Form Party 
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel plan, once the basic agreement for a cease-fire is 
reached, the guerrillas would begin to send leaders back into civilian life to 
form a political party. The guerrillas' radio station and other media would 
also become legal. 
</P>
<P>
With a cease-fire in effect and rebel leaders working above ground, the final 
phase of the plan would go into effect. By Jan. 31, the Legislative Assembly 
would approve a package of negotiated constitutional reforms and agree to an 
election date. The country's electoral laws and system would be restructured. 
</P>
<P>
The government armed forces, now about 54,000 strong, would be "gradually 
reduced to a size strictly necessary for the defense of national sovereignty." 
In a proposal last February, the rebels put that number at about 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
The security forces, now several organizations under the command of the Defense 
Ministry, would be consolidated into one police force under civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Salvadoran government would ask the U.S. Congress to convert its 
current military aid into a fund for the country's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made a Great Effort' 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, they have said our proposals violated the (Salvadoran) 
constitution. We have made a great effort, despite the fact that we don't 
recognize that constitution . . . so there are no obstacles to agreements and 
so that there may be a new constitution for peace," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the absence of military and other high-level government officials 
on Cristiani's negotiating team, saying, "We are worried that the government 
has a concept of prolonged dialogue. Now, to prolong the dialogue in the 
framework of national pressure that exists, is to prolong the war." 
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, El Salvador's army chief of staff, 
said he distrusted the motives of the guerrillas and believed they are using 
the talks "as a strategy to gain the political initiative and international 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused in Killing 
</P>
<P>
The military, which allegedly participated in the early death squads, is sure 
to oppose the prosecution of any of its members for human rights abuses. The 
Arena party is led by retired Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, accused of 
masterminding the killing of Romero, who was shot down as he said Mass on March 
24, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Romero has become a martyr to the Salvadoran left. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Romeo Tobar Astorga, the conservative president of El Salvador's 
Episcopal Conference whom Cristiani named as an observer to the talks, said the 
guerrilla demand to prosecute Romero's killers is "partial." 
</P>
<P>
"The guerrillas have killed many people, too. Msgr. Romero is just one among 
70,000 victims of the war. His life is not worth more because he is a bishop," 
Tobar said.

CHICANO FEDERATION, S.D. SETTLE RIGHTS SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS MAY DECIDE IN JUNE WHETHER TO EXPAND 8-MEMBER COUNCIL TO 10; FEES MAY 
CLOUD ISSUE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city and the Chicano Federation on Wednesday agreed on a plan designed to 
enhance the voting power of the city's minorities, tentatively resolving to 
allow voters to decide next June on an 
</P>
<P>
expansion of the City Council from eight districts to 10, effective in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The out-of-court settlement of the federation's 20-month-old lawsuit also 
mandates a redrawing of existing council district boundaries by Oct. 1, 1990, 
using preliminary U. S. Census Bureau data, which federation lawyers contend 
will most accurately reflect the growth in the city's Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision on reapportionment, however, will remain in the hands of the 
council, not the independent redistricting commission first sought by the 
Chicano Federation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubting Members 
</P>
<P>
The settlement cannot be considered final until the council ratifies it, 
possibly as late as Monday. With some members expressing reservations over a 
clause in the agreement calling for the city to pay $20,000 in federation 
attorneys' fees, adoption is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge John S. Rhoades ordered both sides to appear in his court 
Monday afternoon, warning that, if the council turns down the tentative 
settlement, he will immediately hear Chicano Federation arguments to postpone 
council elections scheduled for Tuesday. The federation contends that another 
election should not be held in the absence of a plan to redress minority 
voting-rights grievances. 
</P>
<P>
The federation maintained that it achieved victory on the major issues that 
prompted it to sue in January, 1988, to replace the council's then two-tiered 
electoral system -- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs between the 
top two vote-getters -- with a plan that elects council members solely within 
their own districts. 
</P>
<P>
That aspect of the suit was rendered moot when voters adopted the district-only 
election plan by narrowly approving a ballot initiative last November, but 
Rhoades last month allowed the group to press forward with other elements of 
its suit, among them a bid for a 12-seat City Council and an independent 
redistricting commission. 
</P>
<P>
"This lawsuit was filed to increase the power of Hispanics and blacks. It was 
never a matter of money," said Jess Haro, chairman of the Chicano Federation. 
"Minorities will have the opportunity to elect who they want to elect, and 
also, minority candidates will have a better chance of prevailing at the 
polls." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far From Certain 
</P>
<P>
Despite Haro's optimism, approval of the council expansion is far from certain. 
The agreement does not prohibit council members from working for the defeat of 
the 10-seat initiative at the polls next June, nor does it preclude them from 
placing alternative measures on the ballot, members said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Haro said such activity would be "contrary to the spirit of the 
agreement," Mayor Maureen O'Connor and several council members Wednesday 
repeated their longstanding opposition to a 10-seat council. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the people of the city of San Diego want to expand the size of 
the council from eight seats to 10 seats and pay for the cost of that," said 
Councilman Ed Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor echoed those comments but declined to say whether she will actively 
oppose the ballot measure. She estimated the cost of two new council offices 
and their staffs at about $1 million per district. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to go to the people with this, and that's where it belongs," 
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Out for $125,000 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proposed $20,000 payment to federation attorneys Mike Aguirre 
and Patricia Meyer has upset some council members who believe that the city is 
guiltless. In recent days, O'Connor said, the federation has been holding out 
for as much as $125,000 in attorneys' fees, and the council has been offering 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should pay them anything," said Councilman Bruce Henderson. I 
was willing to pay ($10,000). I'm not very excited about paying" $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They've always said that it's the principle of the thing, not the principal 
and interest," O'Connor quipped. She said agreement on all issues besides 
attorneys' fees was reached days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner promised Wednesday to vote against the pact, declaring 
that it is a deal between the Republican majority and the federation to add 
Latinos to his district in an attempt to oust him from office in 1991. Filner, 
an Anglo Democrat representing a district with a large Latino population, 
defeated attorney Aguirre to win the seat in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Having retained the power to decide reapportionment, Filner said, the 
five-member Republican majority on the council will redraw district lines next 
year to make the 4th and 8th districts even more heavily minority, and create 
six relatively white seats for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be Ghetto Seats' 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting the federal suit off their backs so they can redistrict the 
way they want to," he said. The Republicans will "confine the Democrats to two 
seats that would be ghetto seats. The way they're set up, those two seats would 
have very little power." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, a member of the council's Republican majority, responded that "that 
is not happening so far as I know. There is no attempt to focus on Bob Filner 
as a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group is backing a ballot initiative that would create an 
independent board appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court to 
handle redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative settlement between the council and federation followed numerous 
closed-door strategy sessions held by the council on the future of the city's 
electoral process, including three separate sessions Tuesday. It was made final 
with the aid of U. S. Magistrate Harry McCue on Wednesday afternoon. City and 
federation attorneys then reported the settlement to Rhoades at a previously 
scheduled hearing later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the council would redistrict for the 1991 elections by 
Oct. 1, 1990, with participation of an advisory commission appointed by the 
mayor and confirmed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve the council expansion, a second redistricting would have to 
occur before the 1993 election. According to attorney Meyer, one new council 
member would be elected for two years, the other for four years. After the 
first election, all 10 seats would be filled for four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also would be asked to approve a City Charter revision obligating the 
council to redistrict every 10 years within 12 months after final census data 
is available. The council now can redistrict four to 10 years after the last 
reapportionment.

HAHN FILES SUIT, CITES BRADLEY ETHICS APATHY; 
</P>
<P>
EXONERATED BY INVESTIGATION, MAYOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER and GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stubbornly defiant Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday declared himself exonerated 
by the city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges against him and 
called for an end to the "almost daily barrage of speculation and innuendo" 
that has embroiled his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring strongly critical language in a report by City Atty. James K. Hahn, 
Bradley said that he was "gratified that the city attorney cut through the 
misconceptions and determined that no legal violation of conflict of interest 
took place" with regard to his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
"When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have said all along: I 
did not engage in conflicts of interest," the mayor said. "I did not violate 
the public's trust. . . . As far as I'm concerned, this matter is now behind 
us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Holdings 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary 40-minute speech -- carried on three network-affiliated 
television stations -- and a later question-and-answer session occurred only 
six hours after the city attorney announced he had filed a six-count civil 
lawsuit alleging that the mayor failed to properly disclose some of his 
financial holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's report, the result of more than five months of investigation into 
Bradley, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal 
charges against the mayor. But, it added tersely, "no vindication of the mayor 
is intended, implied or should in any way be inferred." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Hahn said inconsistencies in Bradley's 
interviews with investigators "cast doubt" on his truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's remarks contained several inconsistencies compared to his previous 
statements on a variety of substantive matters involved in the investigation, 
but the mayor made it clear to reporters that he was in no mood to discuss 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley at one point lectured reporters who asked about his involvement with a 
controversial African task force: "No, you are not going to get me involved in 
any further discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Hahn's statement that Bradley had not been vindicated, the mayor 
accused a reporter of misquoting the city attorney. When another reporter then 
quoted directly from the city attorney's statement, Bradley only shrugged and 
said he did not want to debate "semantics." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said of Hahn: "He said he found no evidence that I violated conflict 
laws. That is the bottom line to the inquiry. That is good enough for me. I'm 
going to put the matter behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his mahogany-walled City Hall conference room jammed with 
reporters, Bradley sought to reach out to the voters who elected him the city's 
first black mayor in 1973 and who have sent him back to office every four years 
since, most recently earlier in April for an unprecedented fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently referring to his 47 years in public service -- as a police officer, 
city councilman and mayor -- Bradley grew personal but with understated 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, I love this city," he said. "I would never do anything to harm Los 
Angeles. . . . I hope after all these years, you know the kind of man I am." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the civil action filed by Hahn "far less significant" than the 
city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges, even though the lawsuit 
could result in fines approaching $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor characterized the civil suit as a move made necessary by mistakes he 
made in an effort to act as his own accountant: "The errors I made were not 
deliberate. They show only that I am not an accountant, and that I shouldn't 
have tried to be one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Admission 
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his public admission of last May, when he told the City 
Council -- and by extension the residents of Los Angeles and his political 
allies -- that he had erred in creating an appearance of conflict of interest 
in accepting outside income. 
</P>
<P>
"Engaging in outside employment fell short of my own high standard and led to 
the misperceptions we have all seen," the mayor, 71, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The speech was the latest chapter in a political drama that has enveloped the 
city's chief executive since the spring, overshadowing his inauguration in July 
and the opening months of what many perceive as his last term. 
</P>
<P>
Every effort was made to give Bradley the advantage Wednesday evening as he 
went before reporters and a local television audience. During his speech, the 
mayor appeared at a wooden desk backed by a telegenic blue drape and three 
flags -- decorations not normally in evidence at a Bradley press conference. 
Bradley took care to use a TelePrompTer, a machine that displayed to the mayor 
his words at camera height, so that he did not have to glance at his text. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of his address, he moved to the front of the desk and sat perched 
before the reporters, responding to questions like a stern schoolteacher before 
a collection of students. While taking 40 minutes to deliver his speech, he 
allowed only 20 minutes for questions. 
</P>
<P>
With the city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges against Bradley, 
the mayor appears to have at least initially survived what he has described as 
his worst crisis, although several investigations, including a federal probe of 
his stock transactions, remain unfinished. Bradley refused to answer questions 
Wednesday about his stock portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also defended his refusal to turn over his income tax returns, as the 
city attorney had requested. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you don't lose the privilege of confidentiality of your income tax 
forms whether you're President, governor or mayor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to close the door on the controversy, the mayor acknowledged the 
scars of the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question about the fact that there has been some damage to my 
reputation for honesty and integrity," Bradley told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He added facetiously, "I want to know how you folks are going to give that back 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this spring, Bradley had vowed to not discuss the full ramifications of 
the case until the close of the Hahn probe. He said that he would not publicly 
defend himself because he did not believe his side would receive a fair hearing 
in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Account 
</P>
<P>
While the address was Bradley's lengthiest and most detailed account of his 
activities, he broke little new ground concerning the moves that led to the 
city attorney's investigation. At the heart of the inquiry were questions of 
whether Bradley had attempted earlier this year to influence the city 
treasurer's office to deposit city funds in Far East National Bank, which last 
year paid the mayor an $18,000 annual retainer for consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley declared that he "never directed or pressured" the city treasurer to 
deposit public funds "in any bank." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had not considered his contact with City Treasurer Leonard 
Rittenberg on the matter to be a conflict because "in my mind at the time, the 
two just didn't have anything to do with one another." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley added: "For 15 years, I had never played any role -- directly or 
indirectly -- in the deposit of city funds." 
</P>
<P>
In the Far East episode and other matters under investigation, Bradley 
attempted to portray himself as simply being responsive to favors requested by 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"Requests from constituents are part of the normal business of the mayor's 
office, and I do my best to see that my constituents get the information they 
request from the city bureaucracy," Bradley said. 
</P>

7 CARS IN FUEL TRAIN DERAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven tank cars loaded with liquefied petroleum gas derailed near Byron in 
Contra Costa County, forcing evacuation of 15 homes, when one of the tankers 
leaked a mixture of propane and butane through a broken valve. Emergency crews 
stopped the leak, and no one was hurt. The Oakland-bound, 33-car train jumped 
the rails about 45 miles east of San Francisco. Southern Pacific Railroad 
spokesman Andy Anderson blamed a "mechanical failure" under one of the cars for 
the accident.

HOUSE REJECTS CONDITIONS ON U.S.-BACKED ART WORKS 
</P>

<P>
The House on Wednesday rejected an attempt by California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) to restrict federal funds for controversial works of art in a vote 
he sought to portray as a referendum on pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher sought to insert the restrictions in an appropriations bill for the 
National Endowment for the Arts, but the move was rebuffed 264 to 153, largely 
along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a resounding vote against censorship," said veteran Rep. Sidney 
R. Yates (D-Ill.), a strong supporter of the NEA who led the floor fight 
against the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
After the voting Rohrabacher, a former speech writer for the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, said: "We've lost one battle. Now the American people are going 
to decide who was right. . . . I think there is going to be justifiable outrage 
throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Art Content at Issue 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote was the latest skirmish in a still-unsettled battle over to 
what extent the NEA and other federal agencies should police the content of 
projects they support. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate earlier this summer included in an NEA appropriations bill an 
amendment, submitted by conservative Sen. Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.), that would 
prohibit federal support of obscene, indecent, sacrilegious or racist art 
projects. Rohrabacher wanted the House to instruct its delegates to a 
House-Senate conference committee to adopt the Helms amendment in the final 
draft of the appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the House voted to instruct the conferees to "address the concerns of 
the Helms amendment" in the deliberations. That motion, offered by Rep. Ralph 
Regula (R-Ohio) and approved 410 to 3, also directs the conferees to include 
language requiring lobbyists to inform federal agencies of whether federal 
funds are used to support any of their lobbying activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Examples 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the Helms amendment amid a firestorm of criticism, after it 
was disclosed that the NEA had spent $45,000 on separate projects that involved 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic photography by artist Robert Mapplethorpe and 
Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix immersed in a jar of urine. 
</P>
<P>
The debate Wednesday often turned loud and acrimonious. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints that the Helms amendment is too vague to be 
enforceable, Rohrabacher said: "If there are some in this hall who have trouble 
understanding this clear and direct language, I am sure there are voters in 
this country who will be happy to explain it to them in the next election."

U.S. AIDE SEES OPTIONS FOR SOVIET EMIGRES 
</P>

Bush Administration officials conceded Wednesday that Washington lacks the 
money to process and resettle all of the Soviet emigres seeking refugee status 
in the United States, and one of the officials suggested that some might want 
to go to Israel or return to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish applicants who are turned away by the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service "can always go to Israel or return to Russia," said 
Jewel S. Lafontant, the State Department's coordinator for refugee affairs. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,200 would-be Soviet emigres, mostly Jewish, currently are languishing 
in Rome and Vienna because their applications for refugee status have been 
rejected by the INS. Another 40,000 fleeing Soviet citizens are backed up in 
the two cities waiting to begin lengthy applications for refugee status, 
according to U.S. Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers blamed the delays on a controversial policy change that stripped 
Soviet Jews of automatic refugee status last year and instituted case-by-case 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontant's comments drew criticism from several House members, who charged 
that U.S. budget constraints and Washington's improving relations with the 
Soviet Union might lead the United States to turn its back on Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite glasnost (openness), the Soviet Union has not exorcised 400 years of 
anti-Semitism," said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), chairman of the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law. "To pass 
this over lightly in suggesting that they can return home is the kind of 
attitude that got us into this mess in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges came as the State Department, formally unveiling its proposed 
refugee policy for the coming year, said it will grant entry to a total of 
125,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Within that limit, the department proposes to admit 50,000 Soviet refugees, 
including Jews and evangelical Christians. But the limit falls far short of the 
120,000 Soviet citizens that American Jewish groups believe may apply for 
refugee status next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish groups, citing the large proportion of Soviet Jews in the projected 
refugee total, have not criticized the limits. But they have asked that 
Washington restore "presumptive refugee status" to Soviet Jews who apply for 
emigration in place of the case-by-case reviews. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than abandon reviews, Administration officials plan to conduct more 
of them in Moscow instead of in Vienna or Rome to give applicants a reasonable 
idea of where they stand in the process.

FLOW OF GERMAN EMIGRES SLOWS TO TRICKLE

<P>
The number of East German refugees entering West Germany dropped markedly 
Wednesday, but the diplomatic argument between East Germany and Hungary 
remained heated. 
</P>
<P>
In Passau, the main gateway to West Germany in Bavaria, frontier officials said 
that the flow of refugees has slackened and that most of those who had crossed 
the border since midnight Sunday had moved out for more permanent lodgings 
elsewhere in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15,000 Expected 
</P>
<P>
The total number of East German refugees reaching West Germany through Hungary 
and Austria is still expected to reach about 15,000 by the end of the week, 
Bavarian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has quieted down considerably," declared West German Interior 
Ministry official Detlef Flotho. "Individual travelers are arriving steadily 
but no longer in the mass proportions of Monday and early Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, about 50 East Germans were reported to have occupied the West German 
Embassy in Warsaw in an effort to join their estimated 12,000 compatriots who 
have successfully fled to the West through Hungary in the last several days. 
</P>
<P>
And in Prague, Czechoslovakia, about 180 East Germans remained in the West 
German Embassy -- also hoping to join the exodus of refugees that has created a 
crisis among East Germany, West Germany and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl turned the refugee crisis to his political 
advantage Wednesday by urging the annual conference of the Christian Democratic 
party in Bremen to fight next year's national election with the kind of drive 
displayed by the incoming East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Energy and Optimism' 
</P>
<P>
Kohl urged the 750 delegates to emulate the refugees in the election campaign 
and show the same "energy and optimism." 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, a commentary in the official Communist newspaper, Neues 
Deutschland, accused West Germany of "interventionist, aggressive acts against 
East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some East German comments seemed purposely toned down. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist youth daily, Junge Welt, ran a statement that said East Germany 
should openly discuss why so many people are leaving the country "for 
questionable happiness in the West." 
</P>
<P>
Other commentators in East Berlin, however, continued to criticize Hungary for 
breaking the 1969 pact with East Germany that forbids each country to allow the 
other's citizens to go to the West. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany, one of the hard-line countries in the Communist Bloc, has 
resisted the economic and political reforms called for by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Hungary has instituted liberal economic measures to improve living 
conditions and has increasingly sought financial aid from the democratic states 
of Western Europe -- particularly the Bonn government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hands-Off Policy 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has maintained a hands-off policy in the current verbal battle 
between Hungary and East Germany, analysts say, adding to the anger and 
frustration of the regime in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
And the confusion in East Germany has been compounded by the fact that its 
leader, Erich Honecker, 77, is seriously ill, reportedly recovering from a gall 
bladder operation. 
</P>
<P>
He has not been heard from directly since the exodus of East Germans through 
Hungary and Austria to West Germany began over the weekend.

SENATE FAILS TO OVERRIDE BUSH ON FSX PLANE

<P>
President Bush narrowly won his battle with Congress on Wednesday over the 
controversial U.S. deal with Japan for joint development of the FSX jet fighter 
plane, clearing the way for the two sides to begin work on the aircraft after 
nine months of delay. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the FSX agreement failed to muster enough votes in the Senate to 
override Bush's July 31 veto of legislation that would have imposed additional 
restrictions on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's margin was a single vote. Senators voted 66 to 34 in favor of overriding 
his veto -- a scant one vote short of the two-thirds majority they would have 
needed to overturn his action. California's two senators, Democrat Alan 
Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson, voted to override Bush's veto. 
</P>
<P>
The closeness of the vote was seen as a political slap to Bush, who has prided 
himself on his harmonious relationship with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No House Vote Seen 
</P>
<P>
The House is not expected to vote because of the Senate action. Unless both 
houses can muster the required majorities, the President's veto is sustained. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions the lawmakers had added would have prohibited the transfer of 
jet engine technology from American to Japanese firms and insisted that U.S. 
companies be allocated at least 40% of any work contracts if the aircraft 
ultimately goes into production. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the U.S.-Japan accord warned that the restrictions would be 
unenforceable and might prompt Japan to scrap the deal and seek a new partner 
-- possibly a consortium from Western Europe -- for joint development of the 
new fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's veto, however, was on technical grounds. The President said that two 
additional provisions requiring review of the accord by the secretary of 
commerce and monitoring by the General Accounting Office were an unwarranted 
intrusion on his power. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier action by Congress that led to the presidential veto followed 
months of negotiations between the United States and Japan over the terms of a 
previous accord that had been negotiated by the Reagan Administration.

TUTU LEADS 20,000 IN PEACEFUL S. AFRICA MARCH; NO POLICE INTERVENTION

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the largest anti-apartheid demonstrations in modern South Africa, 
Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu led about 20,000 people of all races into 
the downtown streets here Wednesday, carrying the flag of the outlawed African 
National Congress and banners openly criticizing the government. 
</P>
<P>
The peaceful mile-long march to City Hall, a startling sight after more than 
three years of police crackdowns on most dissent under state-of-emergency 
decrees, was watched from afar by authorities, but none attempted to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, acting President Frederik W. de Klerk had backed down from the 
government's vow to stop the march, saying he hoped his gesture would "prove 
conclusively that a new spirit has arisen in our beautiful country." 
</P>
<P>
"Today we have witnessed the might of our people -- the masses of our people 
under the flag of our people," Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the country's 
largest labor federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, told 
cheering throngs of black, mixed-race, Indian and white supporters at City 
Hall. "We have liberated Cape Town today. Now our task is to make that 
liberation permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, wearing a purple cassock and a silver cross around his neck, linked arms 
with the Rev. Allan Boesak and Cape Town Mayor Gordon Oliver at the head of the 
throng, calling it "a day in which we the people have scored a great victory 
for justice and peace." 
</P>
<P>
The mass of people, singing, chanting and raising their fists in the symbol of 
black liberation, turned out on a sunny, warm day to call for an end to South 
Africa's policy of racial segregation and to protest police brutality that 
civil rights leaders say left 30 people dead in townships near Cape Town last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Banners reading "The People Shall Govern" and "SAP (South African police) Are 
Killers" bobbed above the crowd, which was watched from office towers by white 
business executives in suits. Many marchers wore T-shirts bearing the emblem of 
the United Democratic Front, the giant anti-apartheid coalition barred from 
political activity by the government. 
</P>
<P>
And some demonstrators carried photographs of Oliver R. Tambo, president of the 
exiled ANC, and of Nelson R. Mandela, the jailed nationalist leader, with an 
inscription urging the white minority-led government to "talk to our leaders." 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried this before, but the police always dispersed us," said one 
marcher, Dion Joseph, 19, a mixed-race student. "This is quite a victory. It 
shows that the masses are not behind this government or this Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
The march began at Tutu's St. George's Cathedral and ended at City Hall, where 
2,000 people crammed into an auditorium and 10,000 gathered outside. Speakers 
shuttled between the indoor podium and the steps of City Hall outdoors, where 
they used a bullhorn to address the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In all, at least a dozen state-of-emergency and security laws were technically 
broken by the protest, including prohibitions on public marches, on political 
activity by restricted anti-apartheid groups and on furthering the aims of 
banned organizations. 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week-old "defiance campaign" organized by anti-apartheid groups, 
police have used whips, tear gas and batons to break up more than 50 smaller 
gatherings and marches and have preemptively banned a dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no police action Wednesday. "The impression we're having is it's 
peaceful. No incidents," said Brig. Leon Mellet, spokesman for the government's 
minister of law and order, who along with foreign diplomats and government 
officials watched from the periphery. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid leaders have maintained that the protests of their peaceful 
defiance campaign frequently have been turned into violent ones by police 
overreaction. The election day death toll in the Cape Flats was the largest 
one-day bloodletting in South Africa since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We have today proved that when policemen are not here, when their batons and 
quirts (whips) and tear gas are not around, then there is no violence," said 
Abdullah Omar, a UDF leader, prompting cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great victory for our people, but it is not the end of the road. We 
still have a lot to do to achieve liberation," Omar added. 
</P>
<P>
The government had said that the march, the first officially sanctioned 
anti-apartheid demonstration in three years and one of the largest in nearly 30 
years, was a test case for future anti-apartheid protests. This appeared to 
signal a more liberal approach to protests as well as the government's desire, 
after its reelection last week, to go ahead with plans eventually to negotiate 
with black leaders about South Africa's future. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time to aggravate the differences that exist in our society," 
De Klerk said Tuesday. "This is the time for finding common ground and peaceful 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk is under pressure, both inside and outside the country, to move 
swiftly on his promised reforms. But he remains firmly committed to segregated 
residential areas and schools and opposed to a one-person, one-vote 
constitution, which puts him at loggerheads with the liberation movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The defiance of our people cannot be over because Mr. de Klerk says he wants 
to talk," Boesak, mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed 
Churches, told the demonstrators Wednesday. "To talk about what is the 
question. As long as apartheid exists, our protest will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders have demanded, as a prelude to talks with the government, that De 
Klerk lift the state of emergency, release political prisoners, lift the ban on 
anti-apartheid groups and allow the country's 26-million-member black majority 
to organize politically. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak said the peaceful march proved that the state of emergency, instituted 
in June, 1986, to control what the government described as a "revolutionary 
climate," is "nonsense. We don't need it."

Senate Democrats, determined to use the power of the purse to reshape President 
Bush's week-old drug plan, united Wednesday behind their own alternative that 
would raise spending by $2.2 billion more than Bush requested and cut all other 
discretionary federal spending by 0.5% to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Democratic leaders offered to negotiate a compromise program with 
Senate Republicans and Administration officials rather than force a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) made no immediate reply, but 
Republican sources indicated that he would agree to try to work out a deal with 
the Democrats, who outnumber Republicans in the Senate, 55 to 45. Republicans 
planned to caucus Thursday to consider a response. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Lack Votes 
</P>
<P>
If no compromise can be reached, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
said, Democrats would offer their plan, which was prepared by Sen. Robert C. 
Byrd (D-W.Va.) as an amendment to an appropriations bill. But he acknowledged 
that it would not pass over determined Republican opposition because it takes 
60 votes -- five more than the Democrats control -- to break a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, which had denounced the Democratic plan Tuesday as "price-tag 
politics," said Wednesday that it would give "reluctant support" to another 
approach advanced by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.). His measure would raise 
anti-drug spending by $1.8 billion and pay for it with a cut of 0.25% in most 
other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we really wanted to get on with the job, . . . my bet is: That's it, that's 
the solution," White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman told a House 
Appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Absolutely Unacceptable' 
</P>
<P>
But he condemned Byrd's approach as "absolutely unacceptable" and said that a 
third proposal to finance Bush's funding request by across-the-board cuts in 
other programs would cut too deeply into Pentagon programs. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, resisted Democratic pressure for more spending on 
anti-drug programs than Bush had asked but acknowledged that disputes over 
funding are inevitable. "I think it's important not to make the war on drugs 
hostage to political differences," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Any bargaining over the shape of the drug package would face an implied 
deadline of Oct. 1, the first day of fiscal year 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Using blunt language, Mitchell said that members of his party regard the 
President's plan as "wholly inadequate" to win a war against drugs. He said 
that Democratic senators are united in support of Byrd's plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Redirect Funds 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, speaking to reporters after Democrats had a 90-minute caucus on 
drugs, also said that Bush's strategy must be redirected to put more funds into 
education and treatment and less into law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the session, Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said that he strongly 
supports Byrd's approach, adding: "If we can't cut one-half of 1% from every 
department, we're not serious about winning the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd was named chairman of an eight-member negotiating team for the Democrats, 
which included Hollings as well as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph 
R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the House Democratic Study Group issued a report charging that 
Bush's plan would shortchange 23 states by reducing their federal funds by more 
than the amount his drug plan would provide to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts in Four Programs 
</P>
<P>
Under the President's proposal, a total of $751 million in budget cuts would 
offset his proposed increase of $716 million in new anti-drug spending, the 
group said. Four programs -- juvenile justice assistance, programs for newly 
legal immigrants, economic development grants and public housing subsidies -- 
would account for $604 million, or 80%, of the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic group, an informal group of liberal and moderate Democrats, said 
that California would lose almost four times as much in federal aid as it would 
gain under expanded anti-drug programs. Forty-three states would lose half of 
their new drug fund allocations because of offsetting cuts in other federal 
programs, the study concluded.

ORAL ROBERTS TO CLOSE HOSPITAL, SELL HOME TO HELP MEET DEFICIT

Evangelist Oral Roberts announced Wednesday that he will close his City of 
Faith hospital and medical school and sell his home to help make up for a 
$25-million deficit caused by a drop in donations. 
</P>
<P>
Four other ministry-owned homes, including his evangelist son Richard's house, 
and an 830-unit housing complex for married students at Oral Roberts University 
here, also will be sold, Roberts said at a campus news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 777-bed hospital would close by Jan. 1 and the medical school, 
which is part of the university, would shut down with the end of classes next 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who in 1987 raised $8 million for the medical school after saying God 
would end his life if the money did not come in, left open the possibility that 
"some miracle" could happen. But he said the action was necessary to save the 
4,300-student university. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made," the 71-year-old 
evangelist said. "I hurt because this is my calling, but I'm encouraged that 
we're doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has blamed the sharp decline in donations to his ministry on a "spirit 
of skepticism" in the wake of scandals involving fellow evangelists Jim Bakker 
and Jimmy Swaggart.

FLASH FIRE IN KENTUCKY COAL MINE KILLS 10

Methane gas ignited in a flash "like a flame thrower" in a coal mine Wednesday, 
killing 10 miners in the nation's worst coal mine disaster in five years, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports of the number of miners injured in the fire at 
the William Station Mine in western Kentucky, but its parent company, Costain 
Coal Inc., said no one was trapped underground. 
</P>
<P>
The mine, run by Costain's subsidiary, Pyro Mining Co., had been cited by the 
federal Mine Safety and Health Administration for high levels of methane gas 
about two months ago, Costain President Charles Schulties acknowledged at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll made it the nation's worst coal mine disaster since 27 miners 
were killed in 1984 in a mine in Utah, safety administration spokesman Frank 
O'Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
The ignition point of the fire apparently was near part of a mining machine 
that was being dismantled to be moved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the area around the mine and families of the dead miners were 
taken to a company headquarters building outside Wheatcroft, a town of about 
300 people. 
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the fire was not known. But safety administration spokesman 
Sam Stafford said such fires are usually caused when a piece of metal equipment 
hits stone and causes a spark. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford said such fires are small but "like a flame thrower." 
</P>
<P>
Methane, the major ingredient of natural gas, is found naturally in coal seams.

ACCORD REACHED ON PLAN TO CUT LANDFILL WASTE DISPOSAL 
</P>

Legislative leaders announced Wednesday that they have reached agreement with 
Gov. George Deukmejian on a plan to require local governments to reduce the 
amount of garbage going into landfills by 50% before the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Deukmejian and party leaders from the Senate and 
Assembly ironed out an agreement that would give the governor two appointments 
on a six-member commission being proposed to oversee the new waste disposal 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Elements 
</P>
<P>
Makeup of the commission was one of the last unresolved issues standing in the 
way of the solid waste plan. The final elements of the agreement now will be 
amended into a bill to be carried by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto). 
Sher said he hopes to have the bill ready for a Senate vote today. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the leaders had agreed to emphasize recycling in the bill but provide 
for the burning of waste if local governments cannot reach their waste 
reduction goals. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are strongly opposed to the use of incineration but won a 
partial victory by getting the negotiators to agree to place a moratorium on 
burning during the first five years of the program. Incineration would be 
allowed only if local governments can show that they would be unable to meet 
the 50% reduction goal after trying for five years to dispose of garbage 
through recycling and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
The question of who will sit on the commission was more difficult for the 
negotiators to resolve. They finally agreed to a plan that would allow 
Deukmejian to appoint two of the six members of the board and the next governor 
to appoint another two. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had been reluctant to give Deukmejian four appointments because his 
term expires at the end of 1990, only six months after the board would be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining two seats on the six-member board would be filled by the Assembly 
and Senate. The Senate will be allowed the right to reject the nominations of 
two of the four gubernatorial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonable Board' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are going to have a reasonable board," Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said after leaving Deukmejian's office. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have criticized plans for the six-member commission on the 
grounds that the even-numbered commission would produce too many 3-3 splits and 
make it necessary to garner four votes in order to pass anything.

BROWN GLUM ON INSURANCE BILL'S CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) expressed pessimism Wednesday 
that Gov. George Deukmejian would sign a bill the Speaker is sponsoring to 
provide auto liability insurance to low-income drivers for only $25 a month, 
even if the measure wins legislative passage. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's comments in an interview jibed with other reports that negotiations are 
not going well between the governor's office and the Speaker's office on a 
possible compromise. The insurance industry has questioned whether it is 
feasible to sell auto policies at such a low price without charging 
higher-income customers much more. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown bill is the only substantial effort to deal with high insurance 
prices that still has a chance in the Legislature as this year's session draws 
to a close. If it is not passed or is vetoed by the governor, it will 
underscore the inability of California officials in recent years to act to 
reduce auto insurance premiums that have soared into the $2,000 range in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deadly Serious' 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation among legislators Wednesday that if Brown concludes that 
his bill cannot become law this year, he may hold it in hopes of prevailing 
next year, or at least as a counter against a revival of no-fault auto 
insurance legislation the Speaker does not like. But Brown insisted in the 
interview that he is "deadly serious" about at least putting the bill on the 
governor's desk this year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has passed the state Assembly and is pending in the state 
Senate, already contains features allowing the price of the policy to rise to 
$33 a month. It also provides for a reduction in claims benefits if, in the 
first two years, the insurers run a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown is resisting suggestions from the Deukmejian Administration to amend 
the bill so that premiums could go up even more if necessary to cover the costs 
of service and claims. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the state Senate's committee that deals with insurance matters, 
Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), suggested Wednesday that all insurance bills, 
including some that please the industry, might be linked to passage of the 
Brown bill as a means of pressuring the governor into signing it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Be Coerced 
</P>
<P>
But a Deukmejian spokesman, deputy press secretary Tom Beermann, said such a 
tactic is unlikely to work, noting that the governor does not like such linkage 
and will not allow himself to be coerced by it. Under linkage, one bill is not 
allowed to become law unless another bill is also signed. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, a bill to repeal legislation adopted last 
year that some insurance company lawyers have been arguing sets a state policy 
of doubling auto insurance profits was held on the Senate floor until today for 
technical amendments. Its passage, which had been expected Wednesday, is now 
likely today.

THE MAYOR UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
IN OPTING FOR CIVIL ACTION, HAHN CHOOSES TO FOLLOW WELL-WORN PROSECUTORIAL PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In deciding to take civil, rather than criminal, action against the mayor for 
failing to accurately disclose his personal investments, City Atty. James K. 
Hahn on Wednesday took a relatively well-worn prosecutorial path. 
</P>
<P>
Violations of the California law requiring officials to disclose their economic 
interests in publicly available documents are almost never the source of 
criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
In Mayor Tom Bradley's case, the civil action could lead to fines in excess of 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn also took a conservative route in deciding not to pursue criminal or civil 
conflict-of-interest charges against Bradley in the case of Far East Bank, 
which employed the mayor as its $18,000-a-year special adviser while serving as 
a repository of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the chief obstacle to a prosecution in the Far East case was that the 
key witnesses -- namely Bradley and City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg -- denied 
that the mayor brought any pressure to bear on Rittenberg or other city 
officials on behalf of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said "it is apparent" that a telephone call from Bradley "did influence" 
the treasurer to deposit $2 million with the bank. But he said he could not 
prove that the mayor "intended that influence" -- an element that is required 
to prove a conflict-of-interest law violation. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict-of-interest law states: "No public official . . . shall in any way 
attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in 
which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
Violation of the law -- part of the same 1974 Political Reform Act that 
requires officials to disclose their economic interests -- places officials at 
risk of either criminal or civil liability. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said Bradley clearly had a financial interest within the meaning of the 
law. But he said the mayor and the treasurer both related in extensive 
interviews that the mayor had only asked about the treasurer's relationship 
with the bank and had not tried to influence the treasurer to place deposits 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Making a criminal case without direct evidence of the mayor's intent to 
influence the treasurer would have been a tough sell to a jury, and one that no 
prosecutor would relish. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not to say that there is 'no evidence' of wrongdoing," Hahn said in 
the report, "but it is only to say that, given applicable standards of proof, 
insufficient evidence exists to prove a violation of law." 
</P>
<P>
Making a civil case would have been easier because the civil standard of "clear 
and convincing" proof is less rigorous than the criminal standard of proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hahn said he concluded that there was insufficient evidence even for a 
civil suit in the Far East case. 
</P>
<P>
Said an aide, Deputy City Atty. Edmund Fimbres: "It would have been unethical 
to file charges unless there was a reasonable possibility of conviction. . . . 
There was no reasonable possibility -- criminally or civilly." 
</P>
<P>
Fimbres, a member of the city attorney's Bradley investigative team, said this 
view was held by each of the five lawyers in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hahn's decision not to file criminal charges against the mayor was 
earlier reported by The Times and surprised no one, some prosecutors who were 
not involved in the case said they were taken aback by his decision not to file 
a civil conflict-of-interest lawsuit in the Far East case. 
</P>
<P>
"In civil cases, you just cock your head and say, 'something's not right here,' 
" said one experienced prosecutor, referring to the easier standard of proof in 
such cases. "It seems to me that the evidence (of a conflict-of-interest law 
violation) is sufficient -- just looking at what I've read in the newspaper. I 
just don't understand them overlooking what seems so obvious on its face." 
</P>
<P>
This prosecutor spoke on condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Others said they regarded Hahn's decision as one that might have gone either 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a close question," said Robert M. Stern, former general counsel 
of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Still others were reluctant to comment at all. "It's hard for somebody who is 
not either there or very well informed . . . to be confident in second-guessing 
the city attorney," said UCLA law professor Daniel Lowenstein, principal author 
of the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenstein, Stern and other prosecutors all noted that such cases often turn on 
nuances. 
</P>
<P>
What is clearest is that a prosecutor has wide discretion in deciding whether 
to pursue such litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn referred to this when he said, "The mayor clearly stepped into that gray 
area of the law between factual innocence and a chargeable offense." 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to pursue a civil suit, rather than a misdemeanor criminal charge 
against the mayor for failure to disclose all of his investments, standards of 
proof also came into play. 
</P>
<P>
Fimbres said the office decided that it could not prove that the mayor intended 
to deceive anyone -- a necessary component of the criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
By proceeding civilly, the city attorney needs to prove only that the mayor 
omitted six of his substantial investments in stocks and bonds through 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
This is expected to be relatively easy to show since it was the mayor's 
personal practice to prepare his own disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor amended his statements last August to include the six investments. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amendments came under pressure -- they were made in the midst of 
inquiries from the state Fair Political Practices Commission -- prosecutors 
said they were inclined to view them nonetheless as factors indicating that 
Bradley lacked criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
Omissions from economic disclosure statements are routinely referred to the 
Fair Political Practices Commission, which typically holds administrative 
proceedings in pursuit of $2,000-per-violation fines, and sometimes files civil 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual, although far from unprecedented, for a city attorney to file a 
civil suit for non-disclosure, and in doing do, Hahn trod a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than cite the section of the law that carries $2,000 fines, Hahn relied 
on a section that requires the official to pay fines matching the amount of the 
investments he failed to report. 
</P>
<P>
In Bradley's case, the Hahn aide said, he did not know what the mayor's total 
exposure might be, because Bradley's investments are disclosed only in dollar 
ranges, such as $10,000 to $100,000. However, the aide said the mayor could be 
liable for fines of more than $200,000 for the six omissions cited in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
A Times review of Bradley's amended statements of economic interest showed more 
than 100 errors in reporting items that could be worth $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said that he was referring his report to other agencies -- including the 
district attorney's office and the state attorney general's office -- that 
could also file charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
However, charges by other agencies appear unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have somebody read the report, but I don't expect anything to 
happen," said a prosecutor in the district attorney's office, who asked not to 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has responsibility for filing felony charges. 
The city attorney's office handles misdemeanors.

COUNCIL PANELS MOVE TO SUBPOENA ST. JOHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two key City Council committees on Wednesday agreed to seek a subpoena to force 
Juanita St. John, the embattled director of the Task Force for Africa/Los 
Angeles Relations, to appear before them and explain what happened to nearly 
$200,000 in city funds for which she has not accounted. 
</P>
<P>
The move to subpoena St. John came after she failed to appear Wednesday before 
a rare joint meeting of the council's Finance and Revenue and Governmental 
Efficiency committees, holding hearings on a critical city audit that found St. 
John had commingled city funds with her family's checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Deserve Answer' 
</P>
<P>
The task force has been a favored project of Mayor Tom Bradley, and has been 
funded through the $5.5-million General City Purposes Fund. Since 1985, the 
task force has received about $400,000 in city funds. Bradley withdrew his 
request for funds for the current fiscal year after the task force lost its 
tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Los Angeles deserve an answer," said Councilman Marvin Braude in 
agreeing to ask the full council to issue the subpoena. The City Council has 
the authority to issue subpoenas to compel testimony, but it is a rarely used 
power. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's attorney has previously said that if she is subpoenaed she will 
refuse to answer any questions under her constitutional protection against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
St. John already has refused to comply with a subpoena issued on behalf of the 
city controller, who sought financial records necessary to complete a special 
audit of the task force's finances. The city attorney has begun criminal 
proceedings against St. John for failing to comply with that subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Rick Tuttle and other officials from the controller's office 
testified before the joint committee Wednesday, focusing on poor supervision of 
the general purposes fund. During the hearing, blame for the administrative 
shortcoming was spread over several city agencies, including the city clerk, 
the mayor's office and the council itself and the controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woo Assails Oversight 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo called oversight by the city clerk and the city 
controller "incompetent management." Woo also faulted Bradley for not notifying 
city agencies of financial problems with the task force after the mayor was 
alerted to unpaid bills as early as 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi said the council itself should share the blame for 
mismanagement of the general purposes fund. He and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
said that city bureaucrats are reluctant to look too deeply into the varied 
civic projects funded through the city program and that that is an invitation 
to abuse.

THE MAYOR UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
THE BRADLEY PROBES: STILL NOT OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn filed a civil lawsuit on Wednesday, charging Mayor Tom 
Bradley with failing to meet financial disclosure requirements, but said he 
would not file criminal charges against the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Release of Hahn's report completed a six-month investigation of the mayor's 
connections with Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings and Loan 
Assn.; the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, and Bradley's personal 
investments through the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hahn's report does not conclude the investigation of Bradley's personal 
finances and conduct. The following are still pending: 
</P>
<P>
 The City Clerk is attempting to identify and reconcile all campaign 
contributions to Bradley's most recent campaign fund for possible violation of 
the city's limits on donation amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The City Controller is reviewing the city treasurer's office transactions with 
Far East National Bank and auditing possible misuse of city funds by the 
"sister cities" program headed by Bradley associate Juanita St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Various City Council committees continue to conduct inquires into the mayor's 
ties to two financial institutions and the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating whether funds from the Task 
Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations were illegally transferred into the 
accounts of a real estate investment in which Bradley and Juanita St. John were 
among the partners. THe LAPD also is looking into actions by officials in the 
treasurer's office seeking to cover up Bradley's connection to a $2-million 
city deposit into Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice-Public 
Integrity Section and the Securities and Exchange Commission are focusing on 
the mayor's relationship with Drexel Burnham Lambert examining possible insider 
trading violations in his stock dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The State attorney's general's office is tentatively planning to conduct an 
audit of the Africa Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Hahn inquiry, the following investigations are concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 An audit by the city controller of the Task Force for Africa/City Relations 
concluded that Juanita St. John owes the city $260,714 in missing taxpayer 
funds, including $180,000 in unaccounted funds. A second audit of the city 
clerk's office, which has responsibility for authorizing payments to such 
groups as the Africa Task Force, was found to have inadequate procedures along 
with several other areas of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's Governmental Operations Committee conducted three hearings, 
which sought to learn the focus, methods and progress of the city attorney's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Urban Mass Transit Agency conducted a review of its transactions 
with the city, which were processed through a non-interest-bearing account at 
Far East National bank. The review concluded that proper procedures were not 
followed by the bank and city. But UMTA decided not to require the city to pay 
it the estimated $12,000 in lost interest.

BRADLEY'S TV SPEECH DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a sound bite. It was a sound blob. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday did what all politicians want to do in times of 
political crisis: 
</P>
<P>
He went directly to the people via live television in an attempt to put behind 
him questions about his leadership and judgment -- in this case, the question 
of whether Bradley improperly mixed city business with his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
But even presidents try to hold such efforts to 30 minutes, and five minutes is 
considered by political consultants to be a test of the viewer's patience. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in remarks carried in their entirety on the three network affiliates, 
read from the TelePrompTer for 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't need No-Doz tonight, you already got it," said a Democratic 
political consultant who watched the Bradley address. 
</P>
<P>
Could that strategy have backfired on Bradley as he attempted -- to use his own 
words -- "to put this matter behind us"? 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a longtime Bradley critic, thought it might 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Joe Six-Pack switched to Channel 9," Yaroslavsky said, referring to 
the fact that the independent stations chose to stick with their regular 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bradley got something that hasn't been seen in Los Angeles for some time 
-- if ever: a local politician getting to explain himself for as long as he 
wanted on the three stations with the most viewers as they opened their evening 
news shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In one way, it was a brilliant move," said the Democratic consultant, who 
requested anonymity. "Bradley has his say before anybody gets the 
interpretation from TV news or has it filtered for them in Thursday's 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
But a different interpretation also emerged. 
</P>
<P>
"A politician who spends 40 minutes on TV saying he doesn't have a problem must 
look to the average TV viewer like a guy with a problem," another Democrat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Matters 
</P>
<P>
For much of the day, the news was dominated by the announcement that City Atty. 
James K. Hahn would not charge Bradley with criminal conduct in a variety of 
potential conflicts of interest and other questions raised by the mayor's 
personal financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's investigation of the mayor had placed his own political career in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Reared on politics by his father, longtime Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn, James Hahn is seen almost universally in the political community 
as a potential hot property. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and telegenic, the 39-year-old Hahn has been city attorney since 1985. His 
father thinks he'll be governor or even President one day. 
</P>
<P>
But James Hahn's critics have sometimes called him a "lightweight riding on his 
old man's name," and they have questioned whether he has the toughness and 
resourcefulness to rise in politics -- or to conduct a major investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The probe of Bradley was an opportunity for Hahn to show something. 
</P>
<P>
And some thought he did. 
</P>
<P>
While choosing not to file criminal charges against the mayor, Hahn said in his 
report Wednesday that his conclusions were "no vindication of the mayor's 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon newspaper headlines screamed, "Hahn Faults Bradley" and "Hahn 
Sues Bradley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Report 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic lawyer who does business with the city said: "The thing I love 
about Hahn's report on Bradley is that it is so tough, so thorough and so 
well-reasoned in its language that there is no way Bradley's critics can attack 
it. And that helps Jimmy as well." 
</P>
<P>
But there was another opinion on this too, as there always is in politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see it?" asked a city councilman who spoke on condition he not be 
named. "The whole Hahn report is nothing but a pile of newspaper clippings." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there were some documents too, and Hahn conducted scores of 
interviews with the principals. 
</P>
<P>
But he is bound to be criticized -- if only privately -- for not finding more 
than he did. 
</P>
<P>
Some City Hall-watchers said they thought Hahn was under pressure to find 
something indictable on Bradley, given all of the revelations that have popped 
out over the months and all of Bradley's attempts to explain himself. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hahn simply filed a civil suit against Bradley for failing to report 
some personal investments, as required of all public officials by the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of negligence is not uncommon among state and federal officials, and 
sometimes it is a genuine oversight, as Bradley argued his was. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he concluded that there was no evidence to persuade a jury that 
Bradley broke laws. 
</P>
<P>
All political professionals interviewed Wednesday agreed that unless Bradley is 
indicted, he will not be forced to prematurely end his fifth term as mayor, 
which is up in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been a broad and deep reservoir of support for Tom Bradley 
in this city, and I think his speech tonight was a way of starting to refill 
it," City Councilman Michael Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Chance 
</P>
<P>
But as for the 71-year-old Bradley's winning another term in 1993, no political 
professional thought there was a chance of that. 
</P>
<P>
"The story now is not Bradley's political future -- he doesn't have one," 
Democratic consultant Paul Ambrosino said. "The question now is how effectively 
can he lead the city at a time when it faces so many problems. A politician in 
his situation almost needs some major crisis to solve so that the attention of 
the press and the voters can switch to that and he can demonstrate great 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
In the press conference after his televised address, the mayor would brook no 
talk of being a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that two weeks ago he went to Sacramento and helped defeat an 
attempt to weaken local restrictions on truck traffic during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty good example of wielding power," said Bradley with a big 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has acknowledged that his employment with Far East National Bank and 
Valley Federal Savings and Loan did not look proper and raised questions about 
his integrity, something he has prided himself on in 47 years as police 
officer, city councilman and mayor. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not surprising that when the talk turned to integrity near the end of 
the press conference, Bradley became flustered for the first time in his hot 
hour under the TV lights. 
</P>
<P>
And right after that, the press conference was over.

COAST CHRISTIAN STAR EARL RHODES THROWN FOR LOSS BY INELIGIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coast Christian running back Earl Rhodes, the two-time CIF Eight-Man Small 
Division Player of the Year, is ineligible this season because he has already 
completed eight semesters of high school, the school's athletic director said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Robinson said Rhodes attended Pasadena High School as a freshman in the 
1984-85 academic year. That makes this the fifth year of high school for the 
18-year-old Rhodes, considered one of the top college football prospects in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"He took some bad advice," Robinson said. "Someone should have explained the 
consequences to him." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes was listed as a junior last year when he led Coast Christian of Redondo 
Beach to its second consecutive Southern Section Eight-Man Small Division 
title. In terms of eligibility, though, he was a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Without the 6-foot-2, 205-pound Rhodes, Coast Christian had its 24-game winning 
streak snapped Saturday in a season opener against Victor Valley Christian, 
50-0. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he discovered that Rhodes was ineligible after receiving an 
anonymous phone call last week. He checked the tip with Pasadena High, which 
confirmed that Rhodes had attended the school as a ninth-grader but did not 
participate in football. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said when Rhodes transferred to Coast Christian the following year in 
1985, he was listed as a freshman instead of a sophomore. The fact Rhodes 
repeated the ninth grade came as a surprise to Coast Christian officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Our records showed he had attended Pasadena Junior High before coming here," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pride, who coached Rhodes the last three seasons at Coast Christian and 
drove the student to school from his home in Pasadena, said he was shocked by 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming into Coast I thought he was a freshman," said Pride, now the football 
coach at Webb in Claremont. "I don't know if he wanted to forget (his year at 
Pasadena High) or what. I don't think he knew about the rule." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section administrator Bill Clark said the only way Rhodes might have 
been eligible to play this season would be if he had been physically unable to 
play football during his freshman year at Pasadena High. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have much ground for an appeal," Clark said. "From what I 
understand, when he was at Pasadena he had the opportunity to play. We're not 
in the business of red-shirting people." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Rhodes is attending classes at Coast Christian and hopes to play 
college football next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to try and get him a scholarship," Robinson said. "He wants 
to pick up his (grade-point average) and be able to play football again next 
year. In spite of this setback, he wants to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes dominated his division, the lowest in the Southern Section, each of the 
last two seasons, rushing for 3,829 yards.

A TURN FOR THE BETTER;

CARY CAULFIELD'S BROKEN-FIELD RUN ENDS AT CLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Odysseus was the original "man of many turns," but Cary Caulfield also has 
undergone an odyssey in search of a team and home. Caulfield's quest, like 
Odysseus', has been marked by disappointments, wrong turns and pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Now a sophomore starting linebacker at Cal Lutheran, Caulfield began his 
football odyssey five years ago at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would have been the premier player on nearly any other high school 
team, Caulfield was overshadowed because he played inside linebacker alongside 
Randy Austin, now a tight end at UCLA. The pair led Canyon to 14-0 records in 
1984 and 1985, but recruiters flocked to Austin, who at 6-foot-3 is three 
inches taller than Caulfield and also excelled at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a coaches' convention on the sidelines," said Brigham Young 
assistant coach Claude Bassett, who recruited both Canyon linebackers. "They're 
all watching Randy Austin and being impressed with Cary Caulfield. The opinion 
of most people when Caulfield and Austin were seniors was that Austin needed 
Caulfield's heart and Caulfield needed Austin's size." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon won a CIF-record 46 consecutive games with Austin and Caulfield 
overpowering ballcarriers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were certainly the best pair of inside linebackers I'd ever seen," Canyon 
Coach Harry Welch said. "It was a wonderful dynamic duo. They were different, 
but I thought they complemented each other extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
A strong student, Caulfield wanted to go to Princeton but didn't score well 
enough on the verbal portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he went to West Point. It was his Troy, a place where boys are molded 
into warriors. It is also an incredibly demanding place where one-fourth of all 
cadets leave before their four years are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I went there," Caulfield said. "I went on the recruiting trip 
and didn't like the place. . . . You're just in the army. It was a really 
difficult life. I guess I'd been kind of protected as a child." 
</P>
<P>
Recruited for the football team, Caulfield dressed for varsity home games and 
played junior varsity. Academy life was so grueling, though, that Caulfield 
found football practice the most relaxing part of his day. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some soul-searching and decided I didn't want to live that life in the 
army," said Caulfield, who was facing a five-year service commitment after 
graduation. "You call home and people don't understand how difficult it really 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Odysseus emerged from Troy victorious; Caulfield lasted little more than a few 
months at West Point and left a disillusioned, disappointed young man. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just wasn't ready," Justin Caulfield said of his son's experience 
at Army. "I didn't like the idea that he quit, but I still love him." 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young was one of the few Division I universities to express interest in 
Caulfield when he was a Canyon senior so he went there after leaving Army in 
the fall of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A few months working at a supermarket had convinced Caulfield that, despite his 
experiences at West Point, he still needed a college education. He entered BYU 
in the fall of 1987 with the tacit understanding that he would earn a 
scholarship if he performed well. 
</P>
<P>
For Caulfield, though, Division I football was like the enchantress Circe, 
enticing yet ultimately dehumanizing. 
</P>
<P>
"At BYU the guys were a lot bigger," Caulfield said. "At West Point, the guys 
were small but strong, but football is third there on your depth chart of 
priorities behind the military and academics. At BYU, football came first. It 
wasn't school or anything else. It was just football, and that was probably 
wrong because my grades suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Despite starting in Brigham Young's 1988 spring game, Caulfield did not receive 
the scholarship he expected. 
</P>
<P>
"What (BYU Coach) LaVell Edwards told me was that I was too short to invest any 
money," said Caulfield, who is 6 feet, 236 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very, very loaded," Bassett said. "He was complementary and very 
comparable to those kids, but I didn't think he was better so I didn't 
scholarship him. Had Cary Caulfield stayed here, this year he'd have been the 
first backup." 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield was tired of complementing other linebackers, though, and Brigham 
Young's tuition was a strain. 
</P>
<P>
The football odyssey continued. Caulfied went looking for another school, 
another team, another home, but not without misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I wanted to transfer again," Caulfield said. "I thought about 
my family. I thought it was getting embarrassing to them that I kept changing 
schools. I don't go to any of my old high school games anymore because people 
think it's real funny. They always ask me, 'Where do you go now?' " 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Lutheran, Coach Bob Shoup had displayed the patience of Odysseus' wife, 
Penelope, waiting for Caulfield. Shoup now weaves his defense around Caulfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say we were consistent," said Shoup, who recruited Caulfield 
at Canyon, offered to take him after he left Army and had a scholarship waiting 
for him when he left BYU. "He's going to be a pivotal type of player. He'll be 
on kickoff teams, point-after touchdown, punting, start on defense, call 
signals, probably tape ankles. He's become crucial to our success." 
</P>
<P>
Although he had redshirted the previous season at BYU and did not play varsity 
at Army, Caulfield was forced to redshirt again during the 1988 season at Cal 
Lutheran. The payoff was three years of eligibility, although he is only a few 
units short of being a junior academically. 
</P>
<P>
"He said his goal was to make me wish he was eligible, and he has done that," 
said Kyle Tarpenning, the Cal Lutheran defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"Pound for pound, Cary Caulfield is as good as any linebacker I've ever seen," 
Bassett said. "I very firmly believe he'll be a Little All-American." 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield has a lot going for him. 
</P>
<P>
He is strong -- his bench press of 475 pounds is 15 pounds more than the 
strongest man on the Notre Dame football team can bench. 
</P>
<P>
He is fast -- he ran a 4.66-second 40-yard dash after a summer of speed work. 
</P>
<P>
And he is an intelligent football player. 
</P>
<P>
After inside linebacker Ken Steward, Cal Lutheran's leading returning tackler, 
was declared academically ineligible during preseason practice, Caulfield 
assumed even more importance in the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In Cal Lutheran's opener at Sonoma State, Caulfield intercepted a pass, 
recovered a fumble, completed a pass out of punt formation, made seven tackles, 
punted and tipped a pass that was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield has gone from being a major-college player who thinks of the Trojan 
War as a possible bowl game against USC, to a small-college player who sees 
games against the likes of Sonoma State and St. Mary's as the most important in 
his world. 
</P>
<P>
His odyssey has ended. Austin is third string at Division I UCLA; Caulfield is 
first string at soon-to-be Division III Cal Lutheran, but he has finally found 
a home. 
</P>
<P>
"People here have a lot of heart," Caulfield said. "It's not like BYU where 
it's like a job. People here play because they want to play. I don't see 
Division I football to be cracked up for what it seems. I think this is it here 
for me."

GRIMES OVERCOMES 'LONE RANGER' STATUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hell Week, it must be duly noted, is none too cool for the coaches, either. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Fred Grimes, football coach at North Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
During his Hell Week in August, Grimes scheduled 6 a.m. meetings with his two 
non-paid, college-age assistants. Living more than a half-hour from school, 
Grimes was on the road while most of us were in REM. 
</P>
<P>
And, he had to be asking himself as he knocked the sand out of his eyes, "Was 
it worth it?" 
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1989 season, Grimes had been through a hell of his own, battling 
with school administrators to add Chad Fenwick, a former assistant at Pierce 
College, to his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The administration considered the proposition but offered no promises, leaving 
Grimes with the prospect of manning the ship by himself. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, in turn, considered lowering the lifeboat and resigning. His friends 
echoed the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to resign," said Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, a longtime friend. "I 
told him to give it up. He's in a no-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Without Fenwick, there was one credentialed teacher in the entire North 
Hollywood football program. And Grimes could see that one person if he tilted 
his car mirror and looked directly into it. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching 74 rambunctious high school kids by yourself can be about as appealing 
as, well, as appealing as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Grimes did have help from his two young assistants, Valley College 
students Brad Bock and Jason Garrison, but everything they knew about coaching, 
they were learning from Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
So, entering two-a-days, motoring down the freeway in the pre-dawn hours, Fred 
Grimes was a kind of Atlas, with the world of North Hollywood football resting 
entirely on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
And then a funny thing happened. Fred Grimes began to enjoy himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When you realize you're the Lone Ranger," Grimes said, "you don't commit 
suicide. You back up, you regroup, you improvise. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat down with the two kids and said here's what we have to do. And I'll be 
damned if we didn't accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the challenge took on an appealing air to Grimes. He fed off the energy 
of his assistants. He began to love coaching again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd walk off the field totally exhausted at night. Just totally exhausted," 
Grimes said. "And all they'd want to do is watch film. All they'd want to do is 
learn. It was kind of neat. It was a kind of rejuvenation." 
</P>
<P>
And let that rejuvenation stand as a harbinger of things to come in the East 
Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by either talented personnel or talented coaching staffs, traditionally 
downtrodden programs such as Grant and Poly are taking on signs of new life. 
Meanwhile, Sylmar, under the steady, successful hands of Engilman and his 
assistants, should have yet another winning season. 
</P>
<P>
And at North Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I got more depressed this week, when all the teachers came back 
for the new year," Grimes said. "With everybody learning about my situation and 
coming up to me and saying 'You gotta be kidding. They can't do that to you,' I 
got tired of answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I enjoy the kids and then people are saying, 'I can't believe your 
situation.' So I say, 'Great, just let me go on about my business.' " 
</P>
<P>
Charity would have been welcomed at Poly in mid-August when Coach Kevin Kennedy 
resigned, citing frustration with the administration over the lack of on-campus 
coaches. When Kennedy left, there was no one in the program to step in. With 
two-a-days looming, Poly turned to an outsider, Fred Cuccia. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cuccia has a six-man staff and three paid positions. Cuccia and the crew 
split up the checks to finance all six. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how (Kennedy) dealt with the administration," Cuccia said. "But 
they've been real cooperative in helping me put together a program." 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia seems well-suited for the position. He took over programs at South 
Pasadena and Hoover when each was a league doormat and turned each into 
contenders. He faces another rebuilding project at Poly, which was 0-7 in 
league play last season and 2-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on getting more kids out, getting the better athletes," Cuccia 
said. "Once you get the kids out, the kids are the ones who sell the program. 
</P>
<P>
"If the kids are having fun, and they see you're fair and honest with them, 
they're going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach has produced results at Sylmar where Engilman and his staff 
have a team that is the prohibitive favorite. Running back Jerome Casey may be 
the City's best, and linebacker-tight end London Woodfin and wide 
receiver-defensive back Stacy Lyons are Division I prospects. 
</P>
<P>
But Engilman credits his staff for all his success. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, meanwhile, credits Engilman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been able to keep his staff together and that's a credit to Jeff," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Engilman credits assistants such as Darryl McIntyre, a former nose guard at Cal 
State Northridge, and Obie Brown, a Sylmar teacher who doubles as the offensive 
coordinator, with strengthening his program. 
</P>
<P>
"Assistant coaches do the job," Engilman said. "And I've got a heckuva group of 
guys that have been part of the community. There's no such thing as a head 
coach, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Engilman still downplays his team's chances by talking up a rising Grant team. 
But the catch is that Grant, indeed, should have its best team in years. 
</P>
<P>
During Coach Bill Foster's four seasons, Grant's best record has been 4-5. This 
year's Lancers likely will finish above .500. Tailback Shawn Booker, 
quarterback Marlowe Lewis and lineman Nick Avila are among the best in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's staff lost Tom Meusborn, who left to become Chatsworth's baseball 
coach, but Bob Prado has joined a staff that includes three walk-on coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Foster won't delve into predictions. That's not his style. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about that kind of stuff," he said. "But we've got some good 
ballplayers, there's no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
And, in turn, there is little doubt that, by East Valley League standards, it 
should be a season brimming with optimism. It's easy for Sylmar and Grant, the 
two more polished teams in the league, to think positively in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But at Poly, where gray clouds traditionally gather over the football field 
each fall, Cuccia is working to change that. 
</P>
<P>
And at North Hollywood, where an embattled Grimes could have given up and 
walked, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"During double days, we didn't accomplish anything that we would have 
accomplished if Fenwick had been there," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know what? It was a week I really enjoyed."

DIGEST: GRANT FACES OPENER MINUS TWO STARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grant High likely will open its football season against Narbonne on Friday 
without two projected starters -- tailback Shawn Booker and quarterback Andy 
Wells, both of whom are injured. 
</P>
<P>
Wells broke his ankle and is out indefinitely, and converted wide receiver 
Marlowe Lewis will play in his place, according to Grant Coach Bill Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Booker has an injured ankle and is questionable for Friday's game. Booker, who 
gained 654 yards in 120 carries for a 5.4 average as a junior, injured the 
ankle last week in practice and has not practiced since. Converted fullback 
Tony Johnson will take his place if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Burrows of Camarillo and Cynthia Pardee of Moorpark defeated Terri 
Wells and Allison Evans of Louisville, Ky., 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, to win the Plymouth 
Women's Doubles Challenge Division I title last week in Port Washington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Burrows and Pardee advanced to the national event by winning a Southern 
California tournament and a regional tournament in San Francisco. Both were 
awarded a 1990 Plymouth Sundance automobile.

DAVE DISTEL: WHEN WILL PADRE FANS WAKE UP AND SMELL A PENNANT RACE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be tempting to succumb to the hype and hoopla and say that a touch of 
Padre fever is racing through the populace hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for example, the long and enthusiastic ovation following Garry 
Templeton's grand slam in Monday night's 7-3 victory over the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the long and enthusiastic ovation for the Atlanta Braves' 6-5 
victory over the San Francisco Giants after Tuesday night's 9-0 victory over 
those same Astros. 
</P>
<P>
But a couple of inescapable facts intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Paid attendance Monday night was a mere 12,705. 
</P>
<P>
Paid attendance Tuesday night was a modest 16,509. 
</P>
<P>
Yawn. 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone awake here? 
</P>
<P>
Painfully, inch-by-inch and game-by-game, the Padres have crawled into the 
pennant race in the National League West. They have done it by embarking upon 
the most prolonged stretch of outstanding baseball in the history of the 
franchise, and that includes the pennant-winning 1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their fans are whispering at the water coolers and taking portable 
radios on their boats and maybe listening to baseball while they're watching 
football, but what they're not doing is going to the ballpark in numbers that 
would indicate anything at all is going on with the hometown heroes. 
</P>
<P>
In the five dates of the current home stand through Tuesday night, the Padres 
have averaged 21,973 paid fans. I emphasize "paid," because the radio 
broadcasts always inflate the number by announcing total in the park. 
</P>
<P>
This is interesting because the Padres are averaging 24,835 for the season, 
meaning their fans are not even doing well compared with themselves in this 
most interesting time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, no one in the Padre organization can say this team is being poorly 
supported. Paid attendance through Tuesday night was 1,788,141. An average of 
26,482 through the final eight home dates would produce the second two million 
attendance year in the club's history, the first being 1985's 2,210,352. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, we're now talking pennant race. Whether or not the Padres catch 
the Giants, they are engaged in the most interesting September they have 
experienced. Remember that they ran away and hid in 1984, thus depriving 
themselves and anyone else of the frenzy of a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
To assess interest in the Padres, it is necessary to examine the interest in 
other teams with championship aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Between Friday night and Tuesday night, there were 38 games in which a 
contending team was at home. The Padres, as stated, averaged 21,973 for their 
five home games. The other 33 games had an average attendance of 30,285 . . . 
or 37.8% more than the Padres were drawing for the identical span. 
</P>
<P>
Given that we are talking exactly the same dates, all of these teams had to 
contend with the same potential deterrents . . . high school football, college 
football, professional football (including the Monday night opener) and school 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the only logical conclusion is that there is less interest in San 
Diego than there is elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
There have been two outward manifestations of interest, the first being the 
1,000 fans who greeted the team when it arrived home from a trip at 1:30 a.m. 
last Friday and the second being the fans who stayed after the game Tuesday to 
watch the Braves beat the Giants on the scoreboard television. 
</P>
<P>
But the "greeting" was hardly spontaneous, having been contrived and 
orchestrated by a radio station whose best interests are served by hyping the 
Padres. A little gathering of 100 fans showing up on their own would have been 
more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement over watching the Giants lose on the scoreboard television was 
considerably more genuine. Those people were into it. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Padres themselves can probably be blamed for interest being so 
slow to stir. 
</P>
<P>
That, to be sure, is the opinion of one Jack Clark, who has been a party to a 
number of pennant races in a number of different venues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting close," he said before Tuesday night's game, "but we're not 
close enough to make it real interesting. They've supported us pretty well, but 
we've been so inconsistent. When we start to play well, and they come out, we 
put on a bad show. It's up to us to get closer and prove that we're for real, 
like everybody thought we'd be from the start." 
</P>
<P>
It has been quite a good show of late. Maybe it will last, and maybe it won't. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, the matter of that three-game series in San Francisco this 
weekend. Those will be moments of truth, followed by a trip to Cincinnati and 
Los Angeles for three games each. 
</P>
<P>
If that nine-game swing does not upset the bandwagon, I suspect that San 
Diego's reluctant faithful will finally be on it. The season would conclude 
with six home games, three each against Cincinnati and . . . yes, the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"If it means something coming down to that last home stand," Tony Gwynn said, 
"a lot of people will be coming out here to cheer us on." 
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't mean anything, a lot of people missed a nice little run from the 
edge of nowhere to the edge of contention.

MCMAHON'S RIB INJURY KEEPS HIM ON SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There was evidence on Wednesday that Jim McMahon's rib injury is more severe 
than was originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
Backup quarterback David Archer took all of the snaps in the Chargers' workout, 
and Coach Dan Henning said McMahon's ribs were too sore for the quarterback to 
call signals. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon threw the ball without difficulty, but only watched as Archer ran the 
offense through preparations for Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After practice, McMahon who earlier in the day had failed to keep an 
appointment for a conference call with the Houston media, was in no mood to 
discuss the situation. When McMahon saw reporters near his locker, he addressed 
them briefly, then turned around and said as he walked away, "I felt great. I 
just wanted to take the day off." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said of McMahon, "He didn't practice with the team at all because he 
wasn't able to bark signals. It's like when you scream. That's what's painful 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
After McMahon left Sunday's game against the Raiders with seven minutes left in 
the third quarter, Henning denied that McMahon was injured. Later, it turned 
out the Charger quarterback had suffered strained rib muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Henning said on Monday that he was certain McMahon would play Sunday. 
Wednesday, Henning seemed to have a particle of doubt. "If he feels like he can 
call signals tomorrow, he'll get most of the work," Henning said. "If he 
doesn't, we'll get somebody to call signals for him, and by Friday he should be 
better. Maybe I'll do it myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm led to believe it's an open-ended situation. The doctors say he's OK to 
play, and he says he's OK, but if he can't call signals, he'll have a tough 
time playing." 
</P>
<P>
Henning made it obvious that he doesn't list Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville among 
his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Glanville said in a conference call from Houston that after 
Henning was named coach at Atlanta, he had broken a promise to interview 
Glanville, who had been on the Falcons' staff, for the defensive coordinator's 
job. Asked about this, Henning said he had interviewed Glanville in February, 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Their quotes: 
</P>
<P>
Glanville: "We were going to find a secluded place to talk, but we never got 
together. It was just as well. If I'd stayed in Atlanta, I'd probably be 
selling Toyotas in Marietta (Ga.) Instead, I shuffled off to Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
Henning: "I interviewed Jerry in my office when he was on the staff that was 
let go. It's verifiable, so check it out. I don't know why Jerry would even 
bring up anything concerning that matter. Maybe just because he didn't get the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second week in a row that Henning has closed practice to the media, 
and Glanville doesn't agree with him on that, either. 
</P>
<P>
Said Glanville: "I try to keep my practices open. I may be passing out free 
hats to the media today. I hope to get bumper stickers that say, 'Hug a 
reporter today.' The bottom line is that the media has never lost a game." 
</P>
<P>
Told of this, Henning said simply, "That's interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Johnny Thomas, who was among the last players cut last week, was 
re-signed and defensive end Gerald Robinson was placed on injured reserve 
because of a sore left knee. . . . Henning said wide receiver Darryl Usher, 
another player cut last week who was re-signed Tuesday, would return kickoffs 
on Sunday. "I would think he'll probably take (Victor) Floyd's place," Henning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not happy with the other guy (Jamie Holland) dropping the ball, 
either."

DEVELOPER GIVEN RIGHT TO BUILD THEATER COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Long a cinematic wasteland, downtown may soon become something of a movieland, 
boasting a 14-screen theater complex that could even chase thoughts of Westwood 
from the minds of local film lovers. 
</P>
<P>
In a move considered crucial to enlivening downtown's listless after-dark 
scene, the Redevelopment Agency this week granted a Los Angeles developer the 
right to build the theater complex and 140 apartments on a half-empty block 
bordering Pacific and Pine avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed complex would have about 3,500 seats. If successful, it would 
bring nighttime crowds to an area that now empties before the sun goes down. It 
would also bring an abundance of films to a city that is embarrassingly short 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody agrees that the theaters are an essential element in 
bringing people in large quantities into the downtown area," said City 
Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who, like other officials, hailed the plan. 
Braude's district includes the downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with proposals from two development teams, the agency chose the one 
submitted by Janss Corp. of Westwood and Pacific Theaters, giving the team 
exclusive negotiating rights for 60 days. Assuming the negotiations go well, 
the agency would then sign a development agreement with the team, which says it 
could break ground within six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Most Innovations 
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view, the Janss-Pacific proposal was the most exciting 
because it seemed to have the most architectural innovation," Redevelopment 
Agency Chairman Donald Westerland said. 
</P>
<P>
Janss wants to build an eight-story mixed-use complex of theaters, apartments, 
shops and parking on agency-owned land that would be leased for 55 years. The 
apartments, which would rent from $850 to $1,200 a month, would rise above the 
theaters and face Pacific Avenue. The shops and theater entrance would face a 
courtyard fronting the 200 block of Pine Avenue, between 3rd Street and 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Janss Vice President Max Nardoni said the complex design would have elements of 
Art Deco design, to blend with the architecture of other buildings on the 
block. Most of the $37-million complex would be built on what is now a parking 
lot along Pacific Avenue, although some storefronts in the middle of the block 
along Pine Avenue would be demolished to make way for the courtyard area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers Higher Revenues 
</P>
<P>
According to Redevelopment Agency projections, the agency would make about $5 
million from leasing fees and increased property taxes over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Nardoni said his company, which would lease the theater to Pacific, was able to 
offer the agency higher revenues than the competing developer, Watt/Parker 
Inc., because Janss included apartments in the development and Watt did not. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done it before and have been very successful with it," Nardoni said, 
adding that his firm already has leased all the apartments in a similar 
development under construction in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the downtown area has really started to turn around," Nardoni said. 
"This is really going to help the rest of the area." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a population of more than 400,000, Long Beach has only two theater 
complexes of any size, both on Pacific Coast Highway in the far eastern end of 
town. The last downtown movie houses resorted to pornography and second-run 
films before closing in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
If downtown gets 14 screens though, Westerland hopes he won't have to trek to 
Los Angeles' Westside to see a foreign film. "For me to get up and go to 
Westwood is a real chore."

UNWINDING ON PINE; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH'S HIRING OF OUTDOOR COMBOS DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Barry Banmann was on his way somewhere else in Long Beach late one Thursday 
when the sound of music drew him to Pine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very nice," said Banmann, a 45-year-old harbor worker, glancing 
at the several live combos placed strategically between 1st and 3rd streets. "A 
little bit of jazz on this corner, a little bit of reggae on that corner -- 
I'll try to make this a habit." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city's Redevelopment Agency would be cheered to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the dearth of after-hours foot traffic on the street generally 
regarded as the showcase of the city's downtown revitalization effort, they 
recently took the unprecedented step of committing $109,000 in agency funds to 
a three-month promotional campaign. About $20,000, the officials say, is being 
spent to hire street musicians to perform from 5 to 7 p.m. each Thursday in an 
event called "Unwind on Pine." The rest is paying for thousands of leaflets and 
a series of newspaper ads to publicize that and other downtown events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important part of what this agency is all about," said Susan 
Shick, the Redevelopment Agency's executive director, adding that the agency 
has never before spent so much money on a single promotional effort. 
</P>
<P>
Such an effort is necessary now, she said, to bolster business on the street 
which, for the past three years, has been the home of a group of trendy 
restaurants, nightclubs and art galleries. The businesses were drawn to the 
area by the promise of a downtown renaissance, but it has been slow in coming. 
At least three of the new businesses have failed and several others continue to 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
This campaign "was designed to send a message to the pioneering merchants that 
we care about what's happening to them and have committed resources to their 
need," said Donald Westerland, chairman of the agency's board of directors. "It 
has sent a message of support that can't be misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
But halfway through its 12-week run, the program is getting mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian turnout, some merchants say, has been disappointingly low. A jazz 
band recently dropped out of the series after one of its members, miffed at 
being paid a month late, refused to continue performing. And although the 
owners of some Pine Avenue establishments -- most notably Mum's restaurant, 
System M and the Williams/Lamb Gallery -- say the promotion has significantly 
enhanced their Thursday night business, others contend that the effort is 
ineffectual, overly expensive and too narrowly conceived. 
</P>
<P>
"It needs more pizazz," said Lloyd Ikerd, owner of the new Pine Avenue Pacific 
Coast Club. He noted that one recent "Unwind on Pine" concert drew only 18 
spectators. "We could have saved a lot of money and bought 18 people dinner," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gerry Fishkin, a local psychologist and author who serves on the board of 
the Long Beach Ballet and is a frequent Pine Avenue visitor: "If this is what 
$100,000 worth of advertising does, it's a dismal failure." 
</P>
<P>
Event promoters attribute the late band payments to a delay in the processing 
of invoices, which they say has now been cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Problems 
</P>
<P>
But part of the overall problem in attracting visitors, according to John 
Morris, owner of Mum's and one of the early supporters of the project, is that 
the original concept called for closing the street on Thursday evenings to 
create a festival-like atmosphere conducive to pedestrian crowds. That, 
however, depended on the implementation of a longstanding plan by Long Beach 
Transit authorities to permanently reroute Pine Avenue buses to nearby Pacific 
Avenue. And that, in turn, depended on the completion of construction on 
Pacific Avenue to accommodate the new light-rail system. Work was expected to 
end early this summer, but has been delayed by unforeseen technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to move today," said Larry Jackson, Long Beach Transit director, 
"but the contractor is nowhere near completion." While the official termination 
date is now sometime in October, Jackson said, "it's questionable in my mind 
whether they'll be done by then." 
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles to attracting evening crowds to Pine Avenue, critics say, 
include poor lighting and inadequate parking. Some question the wisdom of the 
Redevelopment Agency's advertising strategy which, among other things, calls 
for advertising the Thursday night event almost a week in advance. And at least 
one member of the agency's board itself has raised philosophical questions 
regarding the ethics of using public money to promote a handful of private 
businesses rather than for public improvement projects of benefit to all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very comfortable with it," said James Kennelly, a new board member who 
was not involved in the decision to go ahead with the promotional project. "I 
don't think it's a proper use of tax dollars. The agency could get all bogged 
down on these piddling things; these (restaurant owners) are big boys -- they 
know how to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Is Defended 
</P>
<P>
Other redevelopment officials respond that promoting business in the 
redevelopment district is indeed within the agency's purview, especially in an 
area like Pine Avenue whose success is seen as critical to the success of 
downtown as a whole. The Friday advertisements -- consisting of two pages in 
the Weekend supplement of the Press-Telegram -- promote more than just the 
Thursday-night events, they say. Other ads are placed in the Grunion Gazette. 
And while the response has not been overwhelming, they say, it is getting 
better each week and is directly benefiting merchants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no magic formula," Shick said. "Our hope is that the (potential) 
strength (of Pine Avenue) can be spread downtown. This is an important part of 
an overall program." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the city's efforts come after a long period of harsh criticism by Pine 
Avenue merchants against Shick's predecessor, Roger Anderman. Many felt he was 
not doing enough to promote business on Pine. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, some critics say they applaud the city's show of commitment 
while at the same time question the efficiency of its effort. "We're going in 
the right direction," Ikerd said, "but it's going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the Thursday night revelers seem to be enjoying the sparsely 
populated sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"This was great," said Kellyann Linehan, 28, an executive secretary who lives 
in the area. "This kind of entertainment is hard to find; I thought the streets 
would be jammed." 
</P>
<P>
Added her friend, Ed Steele, 26: "If this were happening in San Diego or San 
Francisco, there'd be 300 people."

CALTRANS SETS PLANS FOR 3 FREEWAY SOUND WALL JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation has announced plans for three freeway 
sound wall projects in the Long Beach area within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Two sections of wall will be eligible for funding sometime this fiscal year on 
the Artesia (91) Freeway between Atlantic and Cherry avenues and between 
Paramount Boulevard and Downey Avenue, both in North Long Beach. The walls 
between Atlantic and Cherry will span about a mile and cost $4,057,000, 
including provision for widening the freeway. Between Paramount and Downey, the 
walls will cover half a mile and cost $1,083,000, according to William H. 
Minter, sound wall project engineer for Caltrans in Los Angeles. The concrete 
block walls about 11 to 12 feet tall will buffer residential neighborhoods on 
both sides of the elevated freeway. 
</P>
<P>
On the San Diego (405) Freeway, sound walls will be added on both sides between 
Santa Fe Avenue and Alameda Street along the Long Beach border with Carson. 
Long Beach has undertaken to design these walls itself and wants to build them 
on a pay-back basis, Minter said, thereby lessening the cost to about $956,000. 
Work is scheduled sometime after July 1, 1990.

Susan Shick, executive director of the Long Beach Redevelopment Agency, has 
brought a former colleague on board as her redevelopment project officer. She 
is Barbara Knight, who has been acting director of the Glendale Redevelopment 
Agency since Shick left that position earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who was an unsuccessful candidate to be Shick's permanent replacement 
in Glendale, will come to Long Beach to fill a position formerly occupied by 
Raul Escobedo, who left recently to accept a job in the private sector. 
</P>

ONE APPROACH TO CHILD CARE;

BRINGING UP BABY IN THE 9-TO-5 WORLD

Babies napping at a law firm? 
</P>
<P>
Two-month-old Sara Montgomery and 4-month-old Zachary Singleton don't think the 
idea too odd. 
</P>
<P>
For them, the important thing is that their mothers -- legal secretaries Sally 
Montgomery and Florence Singleton of the Monrovia law firm Patten, Faith &amp; 
Sandford -- are close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
A senior partner, attorney Jules Sandford, said he offered the women the option 
because he didn't want to risk losing them to motherhood at home. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a third of our staff there," he said. "Sally has been with me 25 years. 
Also I thought that if one of my kids was in that position," her mother would 
"like the child with her for bonding purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The firm was one of several businesses and individuals singled out at an awards 
luncheon Wednesday by the Monrovia Child-Care Consortium. The 2-year-old 
entity, with representatives from the city, Chamber of Commerce, churches and 
other service organizations, focuses on improving child-care options within the 
Monrovia Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Others honored were Mayor Pro Tem Mary Wilcox, Councilwoman Lara Blakely, the 
Monrovia Volunteer Center and Foothill Inter-City Newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Results of a Monrovia needs-assessment survey conducted in May by the 
consortium showed that 320 of the 383 people who responded needed or were using 
child care. Sixty-one respondents needed child care but could not find it. And 
at least 52 people said they were unable to work or seek training for work 
because of the lack of child care. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the luncheon planned to distribute information packets to about 
60 employers with information on assessing child-care needs of employees, 
procedures for claiming tax credit for employer-assisted child care and 
community resources such as Child Care Information Service, a United Way agency 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to get more businesses involved in child care, said Dr. George

At Patten, Faith &amp; Sandford, an office that housed a copy machine has been 
converted to a nursery, complete with stuffed toys and cribs provided by the 
firm. Mothers sometimes lay their infants on the floor beside their desks; 
colleagues are always ready to help out with work if the children insist on 
receiving attention from their mothers.

"Everybody pitches in," said Singleton, adding she would probably have quit if 
she had been forced to leave her baby at home.

<P>
For his part, Sandford said he isn't worried about declining productivity with 
the distracting pair around. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very conscientious ladies," he said. Anyway, each lawyer has a 
private office.

JUDGE WON'T REINSTATE STAR 49ER WITH 1 KIDNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 1:15 Monday afternoon, outside a federal courtroom in Los Angeles, Mark Seay 
had hope as he awaited a hearing. If everything went well, he anticipated 
playing football again for Cal State Long Beach, as soon as Saturday in a game 
at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they have room for me," he said. The remark was made jokingly because 
the 49ers had lost two days before to Hawaii, 63-10, and it seemed plausible 
they would welcome back a man who had been a star receiver last season until he 
lost a kidney in a shooting at a children's Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
But less than an hour later, U. S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew refused to 
grant a preliminary junction that would have allowed the 22-year-old junior to 
rejoin the team. Lew said there was not clear proof that Seay's remaining 
kidney is working normally. 
</P>
<P>
Seay sat numbly after the decision, realizing he would not be playing at Boise 
or anywhere this season. His attorney, Richard J. Foster, a 49er booster and 
fund-raiser, tried to console him. They did not leave for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was near tears," Foster said. "I told him it wasn't over, that it was the 
beginning of the fourth quarter and a lot of teams pull it out in the fourth 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Seay sued the university because it would not allow him to play, 
claiming that the risk to his remaining kidney was too great. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Monday's setback, Foster said he is considering having the case proceed 
to trial early next year. He said the burden of proof at a trial is less than 
it is at a preliminary injunction hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also said that Seay, who will retain his scholarship, may look 
into the possibility of playing at another school. 
</P>
<P>
Foster had hoped that the testimony of Dr. Stewart W. Shankel, a kidney 
specialist at Loma Linda University, would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Seay's renal (kidney) function is stable," Shankel said in a declaration 
filed with the court. "His creatinine clearance has been consistently between 
72 and 80 (cubic centimeters per minute). While this clearance is somewhat low, 
it is within acceptable limits for a person with one kidney." (Creatinine is a 
byproduct of muscle metabolism and is excreted through the urine; the clearance 
is a measure of kidney function.) 
</P>
<P>
Shankel also said in a letter to Dr. Robert Austin, the 49ers' team physician, 
that Seay was willing to take the risks of playing football with one kidney and 
that he should be allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Austin recommended that Seay not be allowed to play. Austin has said that 
Seay's kidney is not working properly and would be at substantial risk -- from 
a hard blow to the back or from extreme physical exertion. Austin also said 
Seay's creatinine clearance is half what it should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's kidney function is stable, not normal," Deputy Atty. Gen. Christopher 
C. Foley, representing the university, said at the hearing. "We're not saying 
he's an invalid. But is it medically advisable to play? The conservative 
approach is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
CSULB Athletic Director Corey Johnson said Tuesday, "I felt all along the 
institution had done the proper medical investigations and made the right 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Foster had been encouraged before Monday's hearing. He said that Seay qualified 
under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits a university that 
receives federal money from discriminating against an otherwise qualified 
handicapped person. He said that, under the act, Seay, rather than the 
university, should make the decision whether he should play. 
</P>
<P>
Foster also pointed to a report by C.C. Calescibetta, a Long Beach kidney 
specialist to whom the university sent Seay last March. Calescibetta had 
recommended that Seay participate in track, not football. "(Track) is a sport 
generally recognized to be more strenuous than football," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Calescibetta also said that if Seay were allowed to play football, he should 
wear a flak jacket. Foster said at the hearing Monday that the Douglas 
Protective Equipment Co. of Houston would make a protective pad for Seay 
similar to one it made for James Dixon, who has one kidney and played last 
season as a wide receiver for the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The company claims that a person wearing the pad could be hit with a baseball 
bat and not feel any pain. 
</P>
<P>
But Foster said that the overriding issue is whether Seay's remaining kidney is 
working properly. "He wants conclusive evidence," Foster said of Lew. "We can't 
get him conclusive evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that any hope of future success in the case probably will hinge on 
whether Seay's kidney function increases, which Austin doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"We will contact some sports medicine people to conduct extensive studies on 
Mark," Foster said. "If they come in negative, Mark will have to make a 
decision whether to pursue (the case)." 
</P>
<P>
Foster accused the university of being "excessively conservative" and that it 
feared Seay would sue if he played and were injured. The school rejected a 
waiver offer, the attorney added. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we came darn close (to winning)," Foster said. "I think the judge 
really struggled with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Seay, who became a hero when he shielded his 2-year-old niece from gunfire at 
the party last Halloween, said after the hearing that he was having a hard time 
accepting Lew's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had won this case," Seay said, "I could live my life the way it used to 
be."

LONGTIME UMPIRE LIVES AN AIRBORNE LIFE ON WEEKENDS WITH MANY HOURS OF 
PREPARATION, INTENSE CONCENTRATION 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walking through a tunnel under Jack Murphy Stadium, Gordon Wells felt the rush 
that has greeted him before each National Football League game he has worked 
the past 18 seasons. Neither nervousness nor a high, the feeling is one of 
importance. It forces Wells, an umpire, into "a concentration mode" apart from 
the clamoring crowd and the scent of hot dogs, nachos and beer. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, a member of the 1946 Junior Rose Bowl team at Compton College, has 
worked 16 playoff games and two Super Bowls. He is third in longevity among NFL 
umpires, a "solid, dependable" official, according to Art McNally, the league's 
supervisor of officials. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of an NFL official usually goes unnoticed until he throws that 
yellow penalty flag, as Wells did in a preseason game here between the Chargers 
and Phoenix Cardinals recently, or in Monday night's nationally televised game 
between the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins. Only when his flag 
falls do football fans take a good look at No. 89 in the black-and-white 
striped shirt, and it is a superficial look at best. "The average person thinks 
we just walk into the stadium and let the chips fall where they may," Wells 
said. "Nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Officials, paid anywhere from $600 to $2,000 a game, plus expenses depending on 
years of service, attend clinics in the spring and summer. On fall weekends 
they crisscross the country in jetliners, spending much of their time in 
cramped hotel rooms and airports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Departure 
</P>
<P>
To get to Washington, D.C., last week, Wells awoke before dawn last Sunday, 
drove from his Huntington Beach home to Los Angeles International Airport and 
caught a 7 a.m. flight. Arriving late in the afternoon, he spent Sunday night 
and last Monday in lengthy preparatory meetings. He and the other six men in 
his officiating crew were tested on rules and possible game situations. They 
viewed films of the San Diego-Phoenix game and their performances were 
critiqued by NFL personnel. Each received a rating based on performance. At the 
end of the season, the man with the highest rating at each of the seven NFL 
officiating positions is assigned to work the Super Bowl, which carries a 
$7,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
By kickoff time any Sunday, an official has spent about 12 hours in meetings, 
10 hours in planes and eight hours, mostly sleeping, in a hotel room. On Monday 
they have to be back at their regular jobs as businessmen, lawyers, insurance 
salesmen or educators. Wells is chairman of the physical education department 
at Harbor College in Wilmington. "The guys really prepare," Wells said. "Then 
when the game is over you are completely drained." 
</P>
<P>
An umpire's concentration is crucial, not only to his success but to his 
physical survival. Wells is 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds but he is dwarfed by 
today's professional linemen. He begins each play about 5 1/2 yards off the 
line of scrimmage, somewhere between the linebackers and defensive backs. It 
pays to be alert, he said: "On a draw play, your entire life goes before your 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foot Bone Cracked 
</P>
<P>
In one well-known incident in last year's Super Bowl, the ball landed on Wells' 
feet, and so did just about everyone else. Early in the game he was trapped 
between players in a misdirection play at the San Francisco goal line. TV 
replays showed him being buried underneath a heap of shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
The impact cracked a small bone in Wells' foot, but he continued to work, 
eventually to make the most important call of the game on veteran 49er center 
Randy Cross for illegally blocking downfield. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than a minute remained in the game, and San Francisco, which went 
on to beat Cincinnati, 20-16, was marching for its winning touchdown. Cross' 
error nullified a huge 49er gain. As Wells marked off the penalty yardage, TV 
cameras showed quarterback Joe Montana seething and Cross, who was playing in 
the final game of an outstanding career, sulking. 
</P>
<P>
"(The umpire) is in a precarious place," Wells said. "You're dodging players 
all the time. You do it by feel. If you have to look around for these guys, you 
might as well retire. You learn the value of preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL does not allow officials to be interviewed during the regular season, 
so the last chance to get a glimpse of the officials' routine was in a 
preseason game here, and even that was difficult because the NFL restricted 
access to film sessions and dressing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to let the press in to talk to them," McNally said. "But we were 
averaging 15 requests a week. Where are you going to draw the line? Officials 
were constantly up in the forefront where they shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
The officiating crew arrives at the stadium two hours before kickoff. Sometimes 
they dress in cramped quarters. A parade of people, all involved in some aspect 
of game management, knocks on the door to brief or be briefed. Crew chief Dick 
Hantak, the referee, meets with radio and TV announcers and discusses timeouts. 
Men called "Orange Sleeves" because they wear brightly colored bands on their 
arms, are to signal the officials from the sidelines when it is time for a 
station break or commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is basically scripted," Wells explained. "Everything is 
planned out before the game begins." 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour before kickoff, all exit: Wells, Hantak, head linesman Tom 
Johnson, line judge Don Carlsen, back judge Paul Baetz, side judge Gary Lane 
and field judge Ed Merrifield. Each patrols a different area of the stadium, a 
pair go to each team locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Wells walks the length of the stadium, eyeing each player. He is primarily 
responsible for getting the 24 game balls to the field and checking for 
equipment violations. A wireless radio is strapped to his back, a microphone 
taped to his neck. Wells is the official who communicates with the instant 
replay booth in the press box. The replay officials test the equipment by 
buzzing the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. I heard it," Wells shouted back. Earlier, Wells had apologized for 
speaking loudly: "I get used to hollering when this is on because I can't 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
Wells turns out of the end zone and up a sideline. He spots two Charger players 
with towels that do not meet NFL regulations. He informs them that a towel 
cannot be more than 12 inches long and can be worn only tucked into the side of 
the pants. The players want to know if the official is joking. Wells, with a 
firm smile, tells them he is serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of young guys, the first thing they think is that we're putting them on," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medical Casts Checked 
</P>
<P>
Wells is handed a card from the Phoenix trainer. It lists unusual medical 
equipment being worn, such as casts. Wells must check each cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it's the linemen with casts," he said. "They can play with casts, but 
we have a speech to give to each of them that says they can't use it as a 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
At midfield, Wells questions a Charger lineman whose socks may not meet NFL 
standards. Only one pair of socks is allowed. Socks cannot droop and, with an 
eye toward TV ratings, no hairy legs can show. Later, he will inspect the 
kickers' shoes, which cannot be altered or taped. 
</P>
<P>
Wells is amiable throughout the routine, plying his trade with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, official," Charger veteran linebacker Gil Byrd shouted. "This OK?" He 
pointed to a shorter towel on his hip. Wells nodded approval. 
</P>
<P>
Wells retrieves a brown bag of balls and hands them to a teen-age ball boy, 
saying: "They're all yours, my friend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Replay Dispute 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be an uneventful game for Wells. He detects his first 
violation -- an illegal block -- at the 13:35 mark of the second quarter. In 
all, he whistles just five penalties. He warns one player about his use of 
hands and tells another to straighten his towel, which is in the front of his 
pants. There is only one replay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Down 17-7, San Diego rallies to win, 21-20, on the final play of the game. A 
victory cannon sounds, and fans cheer the Chargers, who are whooping it up on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Wells walks slowly off the field with Hantak at his side. They disappear 
through a door and up a tunnel under the seats. Wells takes a long drink from a 
water cooler. Fans are still cheering outside. 
</P>
<P>
He turns and smiles. "About 15 minutes, guys," he said to a couple of NFL 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Cards 
</P>
<P>
In the locker room the crew fills out yellow cards detailing each foul called. 
The cards will be rushed to the NFL's New York headquarters to be compared to 
the game films and to similar comment cards from each team's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The compilation of information is used to rate each official's performance, 
which could ultimately lead to that Super Bowl slot. Last year, four members of 
Wells' crew worked the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five minutes later, most of the crowd has left, although about 100 
autograph seekers mill around the tunnel outside the stadium where the 
officiating crew exits. The fans pay little attention to the men, who are 
escorted to their automobiles. Wells, in coat and tie and eating a sandwich, 
admits he is tired, but he is glad he has only an hour and a half drive home, 
which means he can sleep in his own bed tonight, and not in an airplane seat. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually after a game we're all scrambling to catch late flights out of town," 
Wells said. "We don't have a lot of time to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Wells climbs into a white Mercedes 300D with California license plates that 
read "NFL 89," a gift from his wife. He puts the car in gear and drives off 
into the damp San Diego air. Each of the next 15 weekends will find him in a 
new town, but for now, few notice his car disappearing into the night.

SUSPECT IN DRUG SALES HELD AFTER BANG-UP CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer9/14/89 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man described as a "significant" drug trafficker has been arrested after he 
attempted to run down two federal agents in the Fairfax District during a vain 
bid for escape in which his car rammed eight other vehicles, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that Dario DiCesare, 46, "managed to injure himself in the 
process," suffering a scalp cut, but other than a bump on one federal agent's 
head, no other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Holm, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, said 
DiCesare, an Italian citizen who has been living in a $1-million home on Hidden 
Valley Place in the Hollywood Hills, had been under surveillance for about six 
months when agents saw him apparently buy some cocaine from three men in the 
Beverly Hills area at about 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter team joined in the 
surveillance, DiCesare realized that he was being followed, dumped the cocaine 
in a trash dumpster and took off at high speed, followed by DEA agents in 
federal cars, Holm said. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw us attempting to make an arrest," Holm said. "He had a big Lincoln, and 
he just started banging into our cars -- he totaled one of our cars. I guess he 
didn't want to be taken into custody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Disabled 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the collisions with two federal cars and six other vehicles 
disabled the Lincoln enough to discourage DiCesare, and he came to a halt at 
Waring and Orange Grove avenues, where he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Holm said the agents DiCesare tried to run down were in one of the federal cars 
that he rammed. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve kilos of cocaine, valued at about $180,000, were recovered from the 
dumpster, Holm said. 
</P>
<P>
After treatment for the cut, DiCesare was being held in federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Charges 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bushendorf, a DEA group supervisor, said Wednesday that charges of drug 
trafficking, cocaine possession and assault on federal officers were being 
prepared against the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
DiCesare was arrested in 1983 at a hotel room in Glendale, where police 
confiscated 36 pounds of cocaine. Investigators said DiCesare arrived as 
detectives were searching the room, and he was released without charge because 
of insufficient evidence.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN JAILED IN DEATH OF ADDICT DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 72-year-old Los Angeles man who told authorities his daughter was addicted to 
cocaine and "was already dead in the eyes of the Lord" has been arrested and 
charged with shooting her to death, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Cason said he shot his daughter, Rifka, 29, to "just put her out of her 
misery," investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Cason said his daughter had stolen between $3,000 and $4,000 from him to 
support her drug habit during the three years they lived together in the 200 
block of West 54th Street, police said. He also told investigators that she had 
stolen his mother's engagement ring and four television sets. 
</P>
<P>
When his daughter returned home at about 5 a.m. Tuesday, Cason waited until she 
fell asleep on the couch before he fired a single shot to her head with a 
.38-caliber rifle, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, he called 911 and waited for police to arrive. He was being 
held without bail for investigation of murder.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1ST ENCEPHALITIS CASE SINCE '86 CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man contracted the first confirmed case of St. Louis encephalitis 
in Los Angeles County since 1986, county health officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old man, who was not identified, was hospitalized in August but has 
been released. He told county Department of Health Services officials that he 
had not traveled beyond his immediate neighborhood before he was infected. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis encephalitis has also been confirmed in mosquitoes during routine 
monitoring near the California Country Club in the City of Industry and at Rose 
Hills Memorial Park cemetery in Whittier, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mosquito warning" signs have been posted in those areas, and health officers 
are advising the public to avoid exposure to mosquitoes, which transmit the 
virus to humans. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis encephalitis can cause inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
Most cases in humans are relatively mild, with symptoms of headaches and fever. 
Cases can be more severe, however, with symptoms including confusion, 
paralysis, coma and even death, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR WANTS COUNTY TO POLICE COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor of Compton is seeking voter approval to hire Los Angeles County to 
provide law enforcement and fire protection services because he said the city 
can no longer afford its own departments. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Walter Tucker said the city is caught in a budget crunch and must cut 
corners. By contracting with the county, the city could reduce law enforcement 
and fire expenditures, which exceed $19 million annually, by about 50%, Tucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Already Tucker's proposal has drawn sharp criticism and the threat of a recall 
from residents and city officials who claim that fire and police protection 
will suffer if the county takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he will seek to place the question before the voters during the 
general election next June. He must gather about 10,000 signatures -- 25% of 
the registered voters in the city -- to put the issue on the ballot.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BAIL AT $1 MILLION FOR MOTHER OF SLAIN BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of a 2-year-old West Covina girl was in custody Wednesday in lieu of 
$1-million bail imposed in connection with the murder of the toddler. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Martha Araceli Alspuro, 25, and her live-in boyfriend, Hector Ubaido 
Soto, 22, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and sexual assault in 
the toddler's death. 
</P>
<P>
Alspuro pleaded innocent Tuesday to four counts of being an accessory after the 
fact to murder, rape, sodomy and child molestation in the death of her 
daughter, Yahior Jessica Alspuro. 
</P>
<P>
Soto pleaded innocent to charges of murder and felony child abuse. He also 
denied three special circumstances allegations -- including murder during a 
rape, during sodomy and during child molestation -- charges that could lead to 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Soto was ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
The little girl died at Queen of the Valley hospital early Monday, three days 
after she had been hospitalized with massive neurological damage. Soto and 
Alspuro were arrested after he called paramedics Friday evening and said the 
child had stopped breathing.

NOT-GUILTY PLEA IS ENTERED IN ACTRESS KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Municipal Court judge entered a not-guilty plea Wednesday on 
behalf of Robert Bardo, the teen-ager accused of killing actress Rebecca 
Schaeffer, then set a preliminary hearing date of Oct. 24 in the murder case. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual action by Judge David M. Horwitz came after Bardo's public defender 
refused to enter a plea in protest of his client's controversial extradition 
from an Arizona jail last month. Los Angeles Deputy Public Defender Stephen 
Galindo charged that Bardo was returned to Los Angeles in what he described as 
a questionable extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz also denied a defense motion to have the murder charges dismissed 
against Bardo on grounds that the county court lacks proper jurisdiction in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaint Amended 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark filed an amended 
felony complaint against Bardo alleging special circumstances -- "lying in 
wait" -- a first step toward seeking a death penalty in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Described by police as an obsessed fan, Bardo is charged with stalking and then 
gunning down Schaeffer, the 21-year-old star of the television situation comedy 
"My Sister Sam" at her Fairfax District apartment on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested and jailed in Tucson a day later. Police there said he 
in was a disoriented state, "playing tag" with cars on a freeway. Bardo was 
held in the Pima County Jail on $1-million bail, under suicide watch in a 
mental health unit. 
</P>
<P>
But in mid-August, two Los Angeles police officers brought Bardo back to 
California against his will, a move that ignited an interstate legal 
controversy, with Bardo's Tucson defense lawyer charging that he had been 
spirited illegally out of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Momentary Lapse' 
</P>
<P>
After Bardo's return, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner boasted at a 
press conference that the LAPD officers, with his approval, had indeed 
"snatched" Bardo from the Pima County Jail. But Reiner contended that the deed 
was entirely legal -- and made possible by "a momentary lapse" on the part of 
Pima County Assistant Public Defender Lori Lefferts -- a charge Lefferts has 
vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner contended that Lefferts had gone to the wrong court in Tucson to fight 
Bardo's extradition and then failed to go to the proper court to refile the 
papers. Pima County prosecutors later confirmed Reiner's account. That mistake, 
said Reiner and the Pima County officials, allowed Bardo to be returned 
immediately to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In court Wednesday, Galindo argued unsuccessfully for a full hearing into the 
circumstances of Bardo's return to California, saying that new facts are 
surfacing "almost on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
But Clark said that the circumstances of Bardo's extradition were "water under 
the bridge." She added: "It just doesn't matter. . . . The defendant is here 
now . . . and none the worse for wear." 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz found "no violation of the defendant's due process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Singer Also in Court 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case heard Wednesday in another Los Angeles courtroom, teen-age 
pop singer Tiffany asked a Superior Court commissioner to order a Santa Cruz 
man to stay at least 200 yards away from her. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition, the singer claimed that Jeff Deane Turner, 35, had threatened 
her with physical or emotional harm and had shown up at her aunt's Costa Mesa 
home in hopes of seeing the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Turner was arrested in June, 1988, after he tried to present Tiffany -- who was 
then in court for a guardianship case -- a bouquet and a sword. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany also charged that Turner had appeared at one of her Northern California 
promotional events and "kissed me and walked with his arm around me." She also 
said in the petition that Turner had sent her numerous letters, having obtained 
her home address fraudulently from the state Department of Motor Vehicles.

THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT RING TO APPROACH OF NEW KING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Stanley Cup ring that Wayne Gretzky wears is a mass of gold, a dazzle of 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
A Stanley Cup ring is a wondrous thing. Rather common among the Kings, these 
days, but wondrous just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson has a collection of Stanley Cup rings that he won while playing 
for the Montreal Canadiens. Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley started their 
collections while playing with Gretzky at Edmonton. John Tonelli got his while 
with the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
The ring that their new coach, Tom Webster, wears is much smaller. It's plain 
gold. No stone. It commemorates the year that he coached the Tulsa Oilers to 
the championship in the Central Hockey League. That same year, the league 
folded. 
</P>
<P>
"That was, uh, 1983-84," Webster says, holding the ring up at just the right 
angle so that he can read the date. "That was probably my most satisfying year 
as a coach. I felt so proud of what we were able to accomplish, in spite of 
some of the hardest obstacles, against the greatest odds." 
</P>
<P>
A brief silence greets this revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Can he possibly be serious? Does he actually think it's wise to call attention 
to his days with the Tulsa Oilers when the question underlying all the hundreds 
of questions put to him during this training camp, really, is whether or not 
he's the right man to coach these Kings? 
</P>
<P>
Webster seems not to notice the silence. He seems not at all concerned about 
convincing any reporters of anything. He's not trying to be wise, any more than 
he's trying to wise off. 
</P>
<P>
He has been asked about his coaching history, and he's happy to tell the war 
stories, telling them with the ease of a man who enjoys the folks around him 
whether those folks are strangers in an airport lounge, reporters in a press 
room or superstars on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Webster zips right through the story of the season that his own team, the 
eventual champion, actually folded before the league did. 
</P>
<P>
The oilman who owned the Oilers -- an affiliate of the New York Rangers -- had 
some money troubles and they found themselves without a rink. The league, 
however, decided to put the players and coaches in a hotel in Denver and had 
them finish the season as a traveling team, kind of like the Harlem 
Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentine's Day, we found out," Webster says. "I said, 'Isn't this sweet?' So 
our families all went home and we played our last 33 games on the road, and 
then all our playoff games. Which meant we played, maybe, 60 games of the total 
season away, putting to rest the notion that you can't win on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Webster leans forward and smiles as he gets to the part that he knows is going 
to get a big reaction, even without having Ed McMahon to ask: "How bad was it?" 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, while we were still in Tulsa, we were having to practice on the 
ice rink in a shopping mall. We'd have the players up at 5:30 in the morning, 
arriving in their gear. We couldn't use pucks or we would have been breaking 
all the shop windows. So we practiced with a Nerf soccer ball!" 
</P>
<P>
No more silence. Webster has won over his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exciting season," he says. "I had to improvise and adjust. We had to 
stick together as a team and do it as a team. We had fun with it. Ask Chris 
Kontos about it. Or Gord Walker or Ron Scott." 
</P>
<P>
Webster has just named everyone currently on the Kings' uncut roster who can 
verify his stories. Who can say whether they had as much fun as their coach 
with what some might see as a nightmarish experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask Robbie Ftorek, he was on that team." 
</P>
<P>
Now, there's a punch line. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Ftorek's name has been mentioned often during this training camp as 
everyone except Webster himself compares -- or rather contrasts -- Webster and 
Ftorek. Webster refuses to discuss the coach he replaced at the end of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not fair for me to do," Webster said. "Robbie is Robbie. He did his 
thing. You look at yourself and you do what is the best to suit the hockey 
club." 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious difference between the two is style. Ftorek set himself apart 
-- from the fans, from reporters, often from the owner, even from the players. 
He apparently thought he never had to explain himself to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Webster is a communicator and a people person. As is the Kings' owner, Bruce 
McNall. 
</P>
<P>
McNall likes his team to be one big, happy family. So far, the family is happy 
with Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he thought the team was reacting to Webster, McNall said: 
"Spectacular! All the players I've talked to really seem to enjoy him. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks a lot. He's a good communicator. We know he can be stern when he has 
to be. I think they have a great deal of respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky backs that up, saying of Webster: "He's first class. He has a 
tremendous amount of respect from all the players. He's very fair. He's easy to 
talk to and easy to deal with. He has the right attitude. He wants us to work 
hard, but enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille's early impression: "I like him. I can talk to him. I think you 
can say that he's laid-back. But I wouldn't want to fool with him." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Rogie Vachon said: "He can compromise, but he can also be 
tough. This can be a tough team to handle because of the personalities. Some of 
the players who were regulars last year might not be this year. It might be 
hard to keep everyone happy." 
</P>
<P>
But at least Webster is concerned about doing that. He wants to keep the team 
in a happy balance. And he differs with Ftorek's philosophy of treating all 
players the same. Remember Ftorek's insistence that all players, including 
Gretzky, were just pieces of the puzzle? 
</P>
<P>
Webster said of Gretzky: "He's one of the best hockey players ever. Why not 
play him as much as I can? I'd be a fool not to play him as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Webster realizes that he's dealing with a veteran team. He treats them 
accordingly. At 40, he's older than any of them, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
And said that, depending upon how the season developed, he would have no 
problem with giving veterans such as Robinson and Gretzky extra days off, maybe 
even short vacations mid-season, if he thought it would help them be ready for 
the playoff stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it bothered him that Gretzky is so close to McNall, and has been 
influential in whether deals were made or not made, Webster said: "Heck, no. 
The more you can get from everyone in the organization, the better. The 
successful organizations have staff, management and players working toward a 
common goal." 
</P>
<P>
The goal? 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is the Stanley Cup," he said without flinching. "It's attainable. 
It's there. We've made the proper acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
Webster is, himself, one of the acquisitions. And he seems to understand all 
the attention being paid to how he sees his role with the team and how the team 
sees him. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach is part of the team," Webster said. "He's a part of the team as well 
as the players. The job of the coach is to set some form of leadership and 
guidance. They look for that. And preparation. Having them prepared is my job. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to help them with leadership, guidance, direction -- and patience." 
</P>
<P>
He seems quite confident, but he knows there is some concern about his lack of 
experience as a National Hockey League coach. 
</P>
<P>
Webster played in the NHL, for Detroit in 1970-71 and for Oakland in 1971-72, 
and in the World Hockey Assn., for New England 1972-79. He finished his playing 
career with one year in Detroit. He worked his way up through the coaching 
ranks, then, coaching the Red Wings of the American Hockey League to the Calder 
Cup title in 1981, and moving on to the Central Hockey League, where he won the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers hired him to coach in the NHL, but he coached only 14 games in the 
fall of 1986 before having to resign because of inner ear problems that 
required surgery and made it impossible for him to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"The stint in New York helped prepare me for this job," Webster said. "But 
going back to Windsor (to coach his hometown team in the Ontario Hockey League) 
helped, too. Coaching at any level gives you a chance to experiment, improvise, 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
And McNall likes to point out that Webster has won at every level. 
</P>
<P>
He coached Windsor to an OHL title. 
</P>
<P>
It's all hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks that he is taking over one of the toughest jobs in hockey, 
if he thinks there is a gun at his head to win a Stanley Cup, he said: "I don't 
think there is any easy job in coaching. You put pressure on yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think we are expected to win. But I think that's good. It's so nice to 
know that we have that kind of talent. It's there. Now we just have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty tall order, a pretty sobering thought. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing he has those lucky purple Christian Dior socks his wife bought two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He blushed as he told it, but he was asked if he had any superstitions. A lot 
of the guys in hockey do, you know. So Webster had to tell about the World War 
II medal that his father, Tom, left him. And he had to tell about his ritual of 
eating spaghetti on the afternoon of a game. And the socks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is embarrassing," he moaned. "My wife said purple was the lucky color 
that year. When it turned out she was right, and those socks really were lucky, 
my son borrowed them and ended up scoring the winning goal in overtime one 
night. We haven't washed them in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more, but I'm afraid I've said too much already." 
</P>
<P>
Got any lucky sweaters? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not sweaters," he said, laughing as he saw the trap developing. "The 
sweaters are Robbie's, and we're not talking here about Robbie, are we?"

DAY RIDES 8 WINNERS AT ARLINGTON

Pat Day rode eight winners in nine mounts Wednesday at Arlington International 
Racecourse, the best percentage day for a rider at a North American track. 
</P>
<P>
Three riders have had eight winners on a single program -- David Gall, R.D. 
Williams and Chris Loseth -- but they had 10 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Gall did it at Cahokia Downs in southern Illinois on Oct. 18, 1978; Williams at 
Lincoln (Neb.) on Sept. 29, 1984; and Loseth on April 9, 1984, at Exhibition 
Park, Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Antley had nine winners in 14 mounts on Oct. 31, 1987, riding in the day 
program at Aqueduct in New York, and the night card at the Meadowlands in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in a little bit of a shock. The reality of what I've done hasn't 
quite sunk in," Day said. "I couldn't have done it without the owners, the 
trainers and my agent, Fred Aime. Something like this you can't put into 
words." 
</P>
<P>
One of his winners came in the $37,350 Arch Ward Stakes for 2-year-olds. He 
steered Karen's Tom to a 2 3/4-length victory over favorite Secret Hello on the 
sloppy track. Unbridled finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Day's only loser on the nine-race card came in the third race when he finished 
second with Wayne's By George, a 4-1 shot. Speed Tells, the favorite ridden by 
James Bruin, won by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Day, a 35-year-old native of Brush, Colo., who now lives in Hoffman Estates, 
near the track, broke an Arlington record held by Earlie Fires. 
</P>
<P>
Fires had seven winners in eight mounts Aug. 16, 1983, and May 25, 1987. He was 
six for six at Hawthorne last June 19. 
</P>
<P>
Day said he didn't have time to think about setting a record. 
</P>
<P>
"They were running the races pretty fast. I was aware of the number of races I 
was winning," he said. "It was sort of a fantasy thing that became a reality." 
</P>
<P>
Only two of Day's mounts were favored in the betting: Wonder's Delight at $4.20 
in the fifth race, and Plane Threatening at $4.80 in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Day's other winners were: Shady Family in the first race, $20.40; Full Series, 
second race, $23.60; Rising Moment, fourth race, $8; Kel Irish, sixth race, 
$8.80, and Monocle Miss, seventh race, $7. 
</P>
<P>
Shady Family and Full Series combined for a daily double payoff of $163.40. Day 
also had the Pick 3, comprising the fourth, fifth and sixth races, which 
returned $42.20.

BEING BROTHER OF OAKLAND A'S STAR IS EXTRA BURDEN FOR DAN MCGWIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living up to his own expectations always was more than enough for Dan McGwire, 
San Diego State's junior quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 8 inches, with a throwing arm like a booster rocket and confidence to 
match, McGwire graduated from Claremont High School in 1986, apparently 
destined for athletic stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be the best Dan McGwire can be," McGwire will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
If you wonder how good that is, he will tell you that, too: "I know I can be a 
very good player. But I want to be a great player." 
</P>
<P>
As high a goal as that may be, McGwire fears it no longer is enough. 
</P>
<P>
Circumstances are different. McGwire's older brother, Mark, has become a 
baseball star in the past three years with the Oakland Athletics. That has 
meant changes for Dan. 
</P>
<P>
No longer is he best known as the tallest quarterback in the history of the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division I-A, the tallest and 
second-youngest of five sons of John McGwire, a Claremont dentist, and his 
wife, Ginger. He is Mark McGwire's younger brother. In McGwire's mind, that 
gives him a new burden. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect a lot out of me because they see what Mark has done," Dan said. 
"Mark was a nobody and became this superstar. 
</P>
<P>
The nation loves him. He is a super-hero. He is everyone's favorite because he 
hit 49 home runs his rookie season (in 1987), and no one had ever done that. 
People expect a lot from me because I am his brother. They want me to lead San 
Diego State back to greatness. But I am not a hero. I am only one player." 
</P>
<P>
But for a football program starving to return to the winning ways of a decade 
ago, McGwire stands tall as a great hope. It is that responsibility and the 
attention of the McGwire name that he will bring to San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium Saturday night when the Aztecs play host to No. 20 UCLA in a 
nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
The path he has traveled is not what McGwire envisioned when he left Claremont 
after three seasons on varsity in which he led his team to a 36-3-1 record, 
throwing for 6,559 yards and 65 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's most highly recruited quarterbacks, McGwire accepted a 
scholarship to Iowa. If he was ever to play UCLA, he figured it was to be in 
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play big-time football, and the Big Ten caught my eye," McGwire 
said. "To come back with a Big Ten team and play in the Rose Bowl, that was a 
dream of mine." 
</P>
<P>
But the dream turned sour early in his sophomore season. McGwire had won the 
starting position in spring practice over junior Chuck Hartlieb and redshirt 
freshman Tom Poholsky, but when he returned for preseason camp, he was told the 
competition was being reopened. 
</P>
<P>
He started two of the Hawkeyes' first five games but left both early -- once to 
allow the other quarterbacks to play and once because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire said he was told before the sixth game that Hartlieb would be the 
starter for the rest of the season. Unhappy and unwilling to accept a redshirt 
season as a junior, McGwire decided to transfer to San Diego State at the end 
of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have loved for Dan to have redshirted," said Kansas State Coach Bill 
Snyder, then offensive coordinator at Iowa. "He would have become a far 
superior quarterback. But Dan is a very competitive young guy. He wanted to do 
it now. We gave him that opportunity to try. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan had the better physical tools and the skills of all the quarterbacks we 
had. But Chuck had the experience of being in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years later, McGwire remains bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I played the best of the three quarterbacks, but I didn't get the job," 
McGwire said. "Coach (Hayden) Fry touted me the whole summer. He built me up to 
be this great player, this great god, this savior, and he never really gave me 
a fair chance." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire said he chose San Diego State because he had been impressed by the 
Aztecs the year before, when they lost to Iowa in the 1986 Holiday Bowl, 39-38, 
and because their coach at the time, Denny Stolz, had a reputation for throwing 
the football. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire said he also wanted to return closer to home and figured if he had to 
sit out the 1988 season, as required under NCAA transfer rules, he would prefer 
do that in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people say it is a step down, going from the Big Ten to the WAC 
(Western Athletic Conference)," McGwire said. "Well, maybe it is. But I did it 
to better myself and be a part of a program that wants to get to the Holiday 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
But that plan, too, went astray at first. The Aztecs went 3-8 last season, and 
Stolz was fired. His replacement, Al Luginbill, had been a defensive 
coordinator at Arizona State. McGwire knew nothing of his offensive plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stuck," McGwire said. "If they brought in an option quarterback coach, I 
don't know what I would have done. But when Coach Luginbill came in, he said we 
were going to throw the ball. I was very happy. I didn't plan on going away." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire responded by earning the starting position last spring. In his Aztec 
debut, a 52-36 loss at Air Force Sept. 2, he completed 30 of 46 passes for 361 
yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little anxious going out there," McGwire said. "It took me a little 
while to get comfortable. As the game went on, I got stronger. I don't feel 
rusty. My arm is as strong as ever." 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever questioned his strength. Tales of McGwire's right arm rival 
those of Paul Bunyan. The best one may be of the spring game in his freshman 
season at Iowa. That was the time McGwire said he took a half-step back and 
threw a 67-yard pass to Quinn Early. 
</P>
<P>
"Might have been farther than that," said Early, now a wide receiver with the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Now if only Early had caught the ball . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It hit him right in the face mask," McGwire recalled. "The sun was in his 
eyes, and he couldn't see it. I hit him right on stride." 
</P>
<P>
But his arm is not his only asset. McGwire's height gives him a clear view of 
the field, and at 235 pounds, he is not the easiest to bring down. Of course, 
he is not the fastest either, but the Aztecs' quick-drop passing attack does 
not require that he spend much time sitting in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest battle now is to become familiar with the offense. That should come 
through repetition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm young; I'm 21 years old," McGwire said. "I've been around college football 
three years now. I haven't played much, but I have matured a lot in the last 
three years. I've been through a lot back at Iowa. I've been through a lot here 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I've matured very fast and very well. I have (adjusted) well to the situation 
presented to me." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire delivers these statements in a confident, friendly tone that makes it 
difficult to imagine that this is a player with any worries. But that would 
ignore the side effect of his brother's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a super-hero," McGwire said. "People expect me to be a super-hero 
because Mark became so great in one year. They expect me to have all this 
weight on my shoulders, all this pressure. 'Hey, Dan, take this program that 
was 3-8 last year and turn it around to an 11-1 ballclub; take them to the 
Holiday Bowl. If Mark can hit 49 home runs and be a national hero, then you can 
turn this ballclub around.' 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't happen that way. I have go out there and play the best that 
Dan McGwire can play without making mistakes. I just have to try to be part of 
22 guys trying to make the team win." 
</P>
<P>
Dan knows it is not Mark who has placed the expectations on him; it is the fan 
who knows him only as the younger brother of the Oakland Athletics' slugger. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always asking me, 'Are you going to be as great as Mark?' " McGwire 
said. "I can't be as great as Mark. I play football, and he plays baseball. 
They are two different types of sports, two different types of athletes. I 
don't feel any pressure that because Mark is in pro ball, I have to play pro 
ball. If I don't, I'll go on with life." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that is because Dan McGwire, all 6-8 of him, knows he will always be the 
little brother of Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
"He helps me in ways people don't see," McGwire said. "He has done so much for 
me. Mark is my brother. He also is a great friend."

NEWSWIRE: OLYMPIC BOXING CHAMPION IS ARRESTED ON KIDNAPING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy McKinney, Olympic boxing gold medalist, was arrested in Las Vegas 
Tuesday night after he and two others allegedly tried to kidnap a 15-year-old 
girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney was booked into the Clark County Detention Center for investigation of 
attempted second-degree kidnap and conspiracy to commit a crime, said Lt. Greg 
Jolley of the Las Vegas police. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, 23, the 119-pound gold medalist at the Seoul Olympics, remained in 
jail on $12,000 bail Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, who is 4-0-1 as a pro, was dropped by his handlers over a training 
dispute after his last fight two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been in the gym since his last fight, so we terminated the 
contract," said Fred Glusman, a restaurant owner who had served as McKinney's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Glusman said promoter Bob Arum has also severed relations with McKinney, who 
was to fight next week in Jacksonville, Fla., before being taken off the card.

AUDI SALES STILL WEAK, DESPITE FEDERAL REPORT THAT CAR IS SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, 1986, CBS' "60 Minutes" ran a story saying that Audi's upscale 
cars had a tendency to suddenly, and dangerously, accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
Audi hasn't been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
That 1986 report sent the West German auto maker's sales into an immediate 
tailspin, despite the fact that there was never any conclusive evidence of a 
technical problem. From a 1985 peak of more than 73,000 cars, Audi's U.S. sales 
plunged to fewer than 23,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in July, the federal government, which had investigated the sudden 
acceleration charges, cleared Audi in a major report, concluding that the 
problem resulted from driver error. 
</P>
<P>
The report said there was nothing wrong with Audi cars and that drivers were 
guilty of "pedal misapplication," meaning they had inadvertently stepped on the 
accelerator and were blaming the cars for their mistakes. Similar findings were 
released earlier in the year by the governments of Canada and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slight Rise in Sales 
</P>
<P>
For Audi, the news provided a measure of vindication; Audi trumpeted the 
conclusions of the federal report in an advertising blitz, titled "Case 
Closed," as soon as the findings were released. 
</P>
<P>
But the reports seem to have come too late to help Audi, the luxury car 
division of Volkswagen, regain the bulk of its lost customers. Sales have risen 
slightly in recent months, but they remain woefully behind the levels Audi 
posted before the "60 Minutes" broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the report clearing Audi has received far less media coverage 
than the earlier allegations of safety defects. As a result, Audi's most 
critical asset -- its image among America's most affluent and selective car 
buyers -- has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company's dealership network has been decimated during the 
past three years, further limiting the company's potential for increased sales. 
Today, Audi has 53 fewer dealers than it did in 1986 and fewer than 400 dealers 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Audi officials remain hopeful that they can now turn things around. 
"There's been a tremendous boost in the confidence of our organization since 
the (federal) report came out," says Tony Kirton, Audi's U.S. marketing 
director. "Now, in fairly short order, we think we can become a significant 
player again in the luxury car group." 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts aren't so sure. For one thing, the luxury market has 
become far more competitive since Audi's public relations crisis began three 
years ago. Now, instead of just facing other European luxury makes, Audi must 
do battle with the sophisticated, upscale Japanese cars coming from the new 
luxury divisions of Tokyo's Big Three -- Honda's Acura line, Toyota's Lexus 
cars and Nissan's new Infiniti models. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be extremely difficult for Audi to ever get back to where they 
were," says William Pochiluk, founder of Autofacts, a Paoli, Pa., automotive 
market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revamped Models 
</P>
<P>
But that's not to say Audi hasn't been trying hard to win back customers. Soon 
after the "60 Minutes" report, the company offered the largest rebate in the 
car industry's history -- $5,000 -- to any Audi owner willing to trade in for a 
new one. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the company continues to offer a comprehensive and unique warranty 
program that pays for all types of regular maintenance on leased vehicles, even 
down to the purchase of new wiper blades and replacement oil. 
</P>
<P>
Audi has also moved to revamp its lineup in an effort to develop a fresh image. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, Audi has changed the name of its troubled 5000 series -- the 
prime target of the sudden acceleration charges. In the 1989 model year, the 
Audi 5000 was modified and renamed the Audi 100, while the Audi 5000 turbo was 
altered and renamed the Audi 200. The company's Quattro series has also 
undergone a drastic realignment, with a high-performance, V-8-equipped version 
available this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Such actions have led to modest sales gains in recent months -- enough to 
persuade Audi officials that the hemorrhaging may finally have ended. Indeed, 
sales in early September are showing a 54% gain from the same period in August. 
"This is very, very encouraging to us," says Bert Triller, Audi's Los 
Angeles-based Pacific zone manager. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a 1990 sales forecast of 32,000 units, Audi is counting on its first 
year-to-year improvement since the "60 Minutes" report. 
</P>
<P>
The company's crisis "certainly forced us to be creative," notes Kirton. "When 
you come out of something like this, you realize you came out stronger."

REGULATORS TO FILE CIVIL SUIT THIS WEEK AGAINST FORMER LINCOLN OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators will file a civil lawsuit this week against the former 
operators of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, alleging numerous 
fraudulent activities and seeking damages of more than $1 billion, sources 
close to the case said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The long expected lawsuit, believed to be the biggest ever against a thrift, 
will be a comprehensive document filling more than 150 pages and covering a 
wide range of Lincoln's questionable transactions, from securities trading to 
real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency's First Big Action 
</P>
<P>
The suit is expected to name as a defendant Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of 
Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. It also will name most of the 
former directors of Lincoln and most of the directors and officers of American 
Continental, the sources said. The suit is expected to be filed in U.S. 
District Court in Phoenix, where American Continental is based. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will be the first major action filed by the Resolution Trust Corp., 
the new agency set up to handle failed S&amp;Ls. The RTC was created last month 
by the federal law that rescued the S&amp;L deposit insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental, a real 
estate development firm and Arizona's fourth-largest business, filed for 
bankruptcy. Lincoln has been billed by industry experts as the biggest S&amp;L 
disaster yet, which could cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC still must approve the filing of the suit. Sources said RTC officials 
have not decided yet whether to allege violations of the Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as the RICO statute, which would allow 
recovery of triple damages. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, sources said, will allege wrongdoing in Lincoln transactions 
involving high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds, corporate stock 
bought by American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, land sold to 
related parties allegedly for above-market prices and straw borrowers and straw 
purchasers allegedly used to avoid direct investment regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also will charge that a tax-sharing plan between Lincoln and American 
Continental was improper. In the transaction, the thrift gave up $125 million 
in tax benefits to its parent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Alleges Fraud 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit will claim violations of federal regulations in 
transactions involving the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit and Southmark Corp. 
in Dallas and its San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary. Southmark, a real 
estate investment firm, is currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The 
Pontchartrain is owned by a partnership that includes Keating and other 
corporate executives." 
</P>
<P>
The suits also allege fraudulent transactions involving the company's planned 
community developments in Hidden Valley, Crowder Valley Ranch and Rancho 
Vistoso, all in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lincoln's collapse, Keating and American Continental directors and 
officers have been expecting regulators to file a lawsuit against them. But in 
a prepared statement, the company criticized the government's leaks about its 
plans to sue directors and officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We view the disclosure of this proposed action as part of a series of actions 
by the federal government to attempt to unfairly injure ACC and its 
management," the company said. "All of those allegations that we have seen to 
date have been baseless. In the event that any complaint raising those 
allegations is filed in court, we are very confident that we will be able to 
disprove the allegations and we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
A corporate executive, angry over continuous leaks of information, said the 
government has employed an "effective smear campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't even filed the suit and we've been lambasted across the world," 
he said. "This is nothing but old allegations. There's no substance to it. 
They've been sitting in our back yard for four years and they couldn't find 
anything. And they still haven't." 
</P>
<P>
About 22,000 bondholders who bought nearly $200 million in subordinated 
debentures -- which are essentially corporate IOUs -- have claimed in a dozen 
class-action suits that Keating, his executives and accounting and legal 
advisers were engaged in racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
Those suits also claim that Keating hired former government officials and used 
politicians to stall regulatory actions against Lincoln so American Continental 
could continue its alleged fraudulent sale of debentures. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his executives contributed at least $300,000 to election campaigns 
of Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other U.S. senators and, at 
Cranston's request, gave an additional $850,000 to three nonpartisan voter 
registration groups, one of which was formed by Cranston's son. 
</P>
<P>
The senators twice intervened at Keating's behest two years ago to question 
regulators about an unusually long financial examination of Lincoln. And in 
early April, before regulators seized the S&amp;L, Cranston urged the three 
members of the now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board to consider more 
seriously Keating's then pending sale of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and the other senators said they did nothing improper in questioning 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday, Cranston said: "Without in any way 
prejudging the matter, I believe the FDIC should proceed vigorously against 
Charles Keating and American Continental Corp. -- as it should against any 
savings institution -- if it believes it has grounds for a bank fraud case 
against them."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: ENTREPRENEURIAL GAP AT LOCAL UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Schrage 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltech, UCLA and USC are three excellent research universities. But when it 
comes to generating innovation and entrepreneurship in Southern California, 
give them an F. 
</P>
<P>
Glance north to Silicon Valley and you find Stanford University at the hub of a 
vibrant, entrepreneurial regional economy that grows on the leading edge of new 
technologies. While Southern California's universities have successfully 
crafted ties with local aerospace firms, they've become virtually irrelevant 
when it comes to spawning new high-technology industries. Granted, aerospace is 
one of the region's biggest employers, but these days it takes more than planes 
to make an economy fly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're concerned about," acknowledges Richard Kaplan, USC's vice 
provost for research and academic computing. "What happened here in the 1950s 
was that the normal paradigm of engineering was building a Spruce Goose or a 
B-29. Engineers were taught a trade and not so much the skills that now 
characterize being an engineer. By and large, we were involved in the 'large 
systems' area -- not so much in the small, entrepreneurial-type technology. 
Aerospace doesn't inspire the David Packards (of Hewlett-Packard) or (Apple 
Computer's) Wozniak and Jobs." 
</P>
<P>
So while Silicon Valley exploded with entrepreneurial electronics and 
biotechnologies culled from Stanford and other nearby schools, this region's 
universities took a more laid-back attitude. "We haven't had the same spirit," 
says Kaplan ruefully. "We always feel we're lagging Stanford by 10 years or 
$500 million." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if these universities don't have the smarts and the technologies to 
offer. But, outside of aerospace and defense, they've historically been 
reluctant to support emerging industries in the way that a Stanford has.

"Why not UCLA? -- I don't know," says UCLA Vice Chancellor for Research Albert 
Barber. "We don't have the kind of policies and procedures that facilitate it; 
we don't hire for it. When people do come on board, there are no peers or 
mentors doing this. While we do have an extremely good industrial affiliates 
program, we don't have very much participation from smaller industry. We don't 
have the kind of programs they participate in." 
</P>
<P>
While Caltech has several professors actively involved in entrepreneurial 
ventures, there has been very little institutional support until recently. 
"It's certainly one of the things I've noticed," says Caltech trustee Benjamin 
Rosen, a top-notch venture capitalist. "It's an interest of mine to stimulate 
that process." Rosen points out that Caltech recently added legendary venture 
capitalist Arthur Rock to its board and that the school wants to play a more 
active role in spurring new ventures locally. Ironically, two of the school's 
sharpest professors -- Carver Mead in chip design and Leroy Hood in 
biotechnology -- ended up co-founding companies in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have universities interested in economic development," says 
Carnegie-Mellon President Richard M. Cyert, who has moved aggressively and 
successfully to turn the Pittsburgh school into a vehicle for regional growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The school also really has to be interested in entrepreneurship. You have to 
be teaching it, fostering it in your student body. You have to have an 
environment where people are on the lookout for new ideas. The results from the 
Southern California universities would indicate that they have not viewed it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
As schools such as Stanford, MIT and Carnegie-Mellon prove, academic excellence 
and economic development are not mutually exclusive. Why shouldn't Southern 
California universities have both? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Barriers 
</P>
<P>
The issue transcends public/private questions and, as former University of 
California President and retiring MIT Chairman David S. Saxon points out: "When 
you talk about biotechnology and information sciences, you are talking about 
enterprises that are knowledge intensive, so that the key resource is people, 
not energy or raw materials." 
</P>
<P>
The real barriers seem to be cultural. Admittedly, Stanford had a brilliant 
provost like Frederick Teman to spot the Hewletts and the Packards and build a 
culture that warmly encouraged university-industry ties. 
</P>
<P>
MIT's Saxon argues that perhaps there have been too many rules and restrictions 
on faculty consulting and participation in new ventures. USC Professor Everett 
Rogers, who has studied patterns of innovation and written extensively on 
Silicon Valley, notes that Los Angeles "is so big that the whole high-tech idea 
gets swallowed up in the smog." 
</P>
<P>
More explicitly, he points out that, unlike Stanford or MIT, "there isn't a 
frontier space" for new companies to grow. "If there were nine square miles 
lying between UCLA and USC then I bet we would see our own version of Silicon 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Exploring 
</P>
<P>
Pick any reason you like -- the reality is that this will become a crucial 
problem for Southern California's universities. Why? For one, we're at a time 
when new ventures are as critical to the advancement of key technologies as 
universities. Simply to stay at the forefront of knowledge, research 
universities have got to create links to innovative firms. Stanford and MIT get 
a lot out of their relationships with new ventures. Entrepreneurial 
environments tend to stimulate basic research as well. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that, as universities continue to raise tuitions and cry for 
more funding to "remain competitive," the community will want to see more for 
its investment than a bunch of graduates and winning football teams. By 
becoming a resource for new industries, universities can play a vital role in 
the region's economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these are issues that the area's universities have already begun to 
explore. If they are gutsy enough, these universities will be simultaneously 
boosting both the quality of education and the quality of life. If they falter, 
they may find themselves slipping further behind Stanford in reputation, wealth 
and influence.

MGM/UA OFFERS MURDOCH WAY TO GET FILMS HE SORELY NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If movies are ammunition in the global media wars, Rupert Murdoch's decision to 
bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. could give him access to a badly needed arms 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch's News Corp. already owns 20th Century Fox, one of the seven major 
Hollywood film studios. But a single studio can't supply enough movies to 
support his far-flung distribution channels -- and buying from outside 
suppliers has proved difficult in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, the Australia-based media giant has been scratching for a steady 
supply of Hollywood films to fill his new Sky Television, a British satellite 
TV service that could become, along with his pan-European Sky Channel, a model 
for other Murdoch-owned satellite ventures around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Launched earlier this year, the four- channel British service -- which is 
broadcast by satellite to in-home receivers and to cable systems -- has 
consumed some $120 million of News Corp.'s cash in its first five months of 
operation. Yet it is expected to reach only about 1.15 million subscribers by 
year-end, far less than the 2.5 million originally projected by the company. 
</P>
<P>
To feed the service, which includes an all-movie channel similar to Time 
Warner's HBO, Murdoch can draw on Fox's 2,000-film library -- along with the 
roughly 30 movies that Fox plans to release each year under a stepped-up 
schedule that will soon double its former pace. (Walt Disney Co. recently 
announced a similar production step-up, even as smaller Hollywood companies 
have been struggling to hold their own against the rapidly expanding major 
studios.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deals for 2,000 Films 
</P>
<P>
But Murdoch has also been competing fiercely with British Satellite 
Broadcasting, another planned satellite service, for rights to prime films from 
other studios. Funded by a consortium of media companies, including Reed 
International and Granada Group, BSB expects to begin operating next spring -- 
which puts severe pressure on Murdoch to lock in subscribers as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
So far, BSB has tapped its $650-million programming budget to sign deals for 
some 2,000 movies, including packages of recent films from Columbia, Warner, 
Paramount, Orion and others, according to a spokesman for the service. 
</P>
<P>
In one of its key deals, BSB acquired an exclusive six-year license to 198 
recent MGM/UA films, including "Rain Man," "A Fish Called Wanda," "Moonstruck" 
and the two latest James Bond films, "Living Daylights" and "License to Kill." 
</P>
<P>
Sky Channel has signed deals for similar film packages with Warner (which 
licensed "Batman" to Murdoch), Disney, Orion and others. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Murdoch channel suffered a major setback earlier this year when Disney 
back-peddled on an agreement under which it would have co-owned Sky 
Television's movie channel while providing its Disney Channel to the service. 
</P>
<P>
When Disney pulled out, Murdoch sued for $1.5 billion. Under a settlement 
agreement, Disney sold its stake in the joint venture back to Murdoch but will 
license at least some of its films to Sky Television for five years. Yet Disney 
is free to deal with competitors as well, spokesmen for both Fox and Disney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
BSB has claimed it has an edge in the fight for movies because it was quicker 
than Murdoch's service to promise that it would scramble its signal to prevent 
non-paying viewers on the European Continent from stealing a look at the 
movies. According to BSB, Sky Television has now agreed to develop a scrambling 
system as well. A Fox spokesman said he wasn't certain about plans for 
scrambling or the precise number of films that Sky Television has licensed to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointing Performances 
</P>
<P>
If Murdoch's bid for MGM/UA succeeds, the 1,000-film United Artists library -- 
which includes the Rocky, Pink Panther and James Bond movies -- will clearly 
provide instant ammo for Sky Television. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fox's purchase might provide new headaches for Murdoch managers, including 
Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, who might be hard pressed to revive MGM/UA's 
sagging movie production operation at time when the 20th Century Fox unit is 
still struggling to get its own movie unit in order. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has been plagued by the disappointing performance of "The Abyss" and other 
films this year and by constant executive changes, including the recent 
resignation of Fox President Leonard Goldberg in favor of a new movie chief, 
longtime producer Joe Roth. 
</P>
<P>
According to Daily Variety's box office reports, Fox ranks last among the major 
studios, with 6.4% of U.S. ticket sales this year -- just behind MGM/UA's 8%.

ROSTENKOWSKI YIELDS ON CAPITAL GAINS TAX PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH-SUPPORTED MEASURE UP FOR VOTE AS DEMOCRATS OPPOSE COMPROMISE 
</P>

<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) conceded 
defeat Wednesday in his effort to forge a compromise on reducing the capital 
gains tax, clearing the way for approval of a proposal supported by President 
Bush to cut the tax on investment profits over a 2 1/2-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is likely to vote today, lawmakers said, in favor of a measure 
championed by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) and supported by a coalition of all 13 
Republicans on the committee and six Democrat members. It would reduce the tax 
rate on most capital gains to about 20% on a temporary basis through the end of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy meeting with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), 
Rostenkowski told reporters that he would no longer block a committee vote on 
the Administration-supported measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably go to committee (today) and entertain the Jenkins amendment," 
Rostenkowski said. Asked if the measure would win, Rostenkowski replied: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Jenkins proposal, who argue that it unfairly benefits the 
wealthy, conceded that it probably would prevail on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate Plan for IRAs 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from the sale of stocks, real 
estate and other assets, are now taxed like ordinary income, usually at 28% but 
at a rate as high as 33% for some taxpayers. Supporters contend that a lower 
rate would stimulate additional investment and spur greater economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
A cut in the capital gains rate is expected to produce a one-time windfall to 
the Treasury as investors sell stocks to take advantage of the lower rates, but 
it probably would reduce federal revenues over the long-term. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, key Democrats are backing an alternative plan that would replace 
a capital gains tax cut with a proposal to expand tax breaks for individual 
retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who had vowed to help lead opposition to a capital gains tax cut, 
was faced with the threat of losing control of the tax bill if the committee 
did not act by the end of the week. California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel 
Valley), the House Budget Committee chairman, had pledged to bring a tax and 
spending measure to the House floor to ensure that Congress votes on a 1990 
deficit-reduction package before the fiscal year begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid serious damage to the committee's role as the designated originator of 
tax legislation, Rostenkowski agreed to allow a vote on the Jenkins proposal 
that would exclude 30% of all capital gains from taxes through the end of 1991. 
After that date, the rate is supposed to return to 28% and be adjusted to avoid 
taxes on gains that simply reflect inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Oppose Compromise 
</P>
<P>
In seeking a compromise, Rostenkowski had been attempting to persuade tax 
writers to back a plan that would allow taxes on capital gains to be adjusted 
for inflation and to add further tax breaks for assets held for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rostenkowski appeared to have won support from the coalition that 
supports the capital gains cut, most of the 23 Democrats on the committee vowed 
to oppose any such compromise. Rostenkowski was unwilling to desert a majority 
of his fellow Democrats to ram the measure through his committee. 
</P>
<P>
Once he failed in that effort, Rostenkowski tried to persuade lawmakers to go 
along with a "bare bones" bill that would raise the minimum $5.3 billion needed 
to meet the goal of last April's congressional budget agreement with the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
When that approach also ran aground, lawmakers said, Rostenkowski decided to 
accept defeat rather than lose control of the tax bill because of the 
stalemate.

Former Fed Banker Director Sentenced: Robert A. Rough was sentenced to six 
months in prison for leaking secret interest rate data. U.S. District Judge 
Dickinson R. Debevoise in Newark, N.J., also ordered the 50-year-old ex-banker, 
who made an emotional plea for mercy before the sentencing, to perform 200 
hours of community service during two years of probation. Rough sat on the New 
York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984 while president of the National Bank of 
Sussex County in Branchville. While there, Rough admitted in a plea bargain, he 
regularly disclosed advance word regarding the Fed's discount rate to a 
now-defunct Livingston brokerage firm, Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc.

CONSUMERS IN JAPAN DEFENDED BY MOSBACHER

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher predicted today that the Bush 
Administration will treat U.S.-Japanese economic issues on an equal plane with 
America's security alliance with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll find the kind of schism we used to see" when security 
concerns outweighed trade disputes in importance, Mosbacher told a breakfast 
meeting with foreign correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
The former businessman said President Bush "cares a great deal -- tremendously 
-- about the alliance and friendship with Japan," then added, "But he doesn't 
see that that precludes hard negotiations in the trade area." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said he did not think that negotiations that began last week to 
remove impediments to trade would jeopardize America's defense alliance with 
Japan. U.S. bases here, at which some 60,000 troops are stationed, play a key 
role in American defense strategy throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little danger" that trade demands would jeopardize the alliance, 
Mosbacher said, "but I think the earlier you lay these (trade issues) out and 
talk about them, the better the chance of not having something fester and build 
up (to the point) where you really get a rupture of friendship and alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher made the comments after delivering a biting speech at the Japan 
National Press Club on Wednesday. In it, he declared that the "Japanese 
consumer does not get a fair break in his own marketplace" and condemned Japan 
as one of the "most closed" markets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If Japanese consumers had the freedom to make the same choices that consumers 
in other countries make, we would all be the richer for it," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that failure to achieve success in negotiations to remove 
structural impediments to trade in both the United States and Japan would 
threaten "the future of the world trading system." Japan, like the United 
States, he said, needs "to temper its culture" to bring it "into line with the 
times." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks stirred sarcastic questions from Japanese reporters. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, tongue-in-cheek, "thanked" Mosbacher for "your concern for the 
Japanese consumer." The reporter then suggested that America's red ink in its 
trade in Japan would not dwindle significantly even if Japan carried out all 
the reforms Mosbacher suggested, and the reporter asked whether the United 
States is prepared to tolerate any deficit, no matter how high, "as long as 
Japanese consumers benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said yes -- "if Japan has an open market." But he insisted that "the 
plight of the consumer is a direct result of the lack of an open market in 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretary was also attacked for his successful fight to overturn a 
decision by the Reagan Administration and renegotiate a U.S.-Japan agreement 
for the two countries to jointly develop a new Japanese fighter plane, dubbed 
the FSX. The plane is modeled on the F-16 produced by General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese reporter said Defense Agency officials "are declaring publicly" that 
they will never again work with the United States on joint weaponry development 
and asked what guarantee Mosbacher could offer that Washington would uphold 
future agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher offered no guarantee. Instead, he defended the reworked agreement as 
"reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese asked why the United States is urging Japan to carry out 
sweeping reforms of its economic culture by next spring while the United States 
is undertaking reforms that Washington acknowledges could take years to produce 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of answering the question, Mosbacher said only: "Free trade, open 
market. That's what everything is about." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, who declared earlier that Japan has made no moves to open its 
markets, has been reminded by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that Japan had 
increased its imports from the United States by $10 billion last year.

Bankers, Mexico Agree on Debt Terms: The Mexican government and a committee of 
banks announced an agreement on detailed language covering the historic debt 
reduction plan reached between that nation and the bank group in July. The 
language, called a term sheet, will be sent to the more than 500 banks owed 
money by Mexico, officials said. The term sheet covers the period of 1989-92 
and applies to about $53 billion of Mexico's foreign debt, which totals about 
$107 billion. The agreement represents the first significant reduction in a 
Third World government's debt to commercial banks.

The stock market yielded to a late-afternoon barrage of selling Wednesday, 
sending the Dow Jones industrial index below 2,700 for the first time in three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers attributed the selloff partly to rumors, which were quickly denied, 
that a major brokerage firm faced large losses from a position in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 27.74 to 2,679.52, closing below 
2,700 for the first time since it stood at 2,678.11 on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 555 up, 912 down and 526 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The market's drop in the last hour of trading came as rumors spread that 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was sustaining losses from holdings in bonds of a unit 
of Campeau Corp., which is undergoing a financial restructuring that includes 
plans to sell its Bloomingdale's department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch denied that it faced any losses in the junk bond sector and said 
it owned no bonds related to Campeau. But Merrill stock dropped 1 3/8 to 32 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 175.33 million shares, up from 142.14 million on 
Tuesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter 
market, totaled 208.69 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, investors afflicted with interest rate jitters let the key 225-share 
Nikkei index slip 45.94 to close at 34,286.94 after surging 219.22 on Tuesday.

In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at 
2,401.5, up 3.9.

</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds and corporate junk bonds fell in a "flight 
to quality" that sent money into safer short-term Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 15/32 point, or nearly $5, per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield climbed to 8.14% from 8.09% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.8125%, down from 8.875% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined against all key foreign currencies in quiet trading. Gold 
prices rose slightly after falling overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled 
at $359.90 an ounce, up 40 cents from Tuesday. Republic National Bank's late 
quote was $358.70, up 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 146.70 Japanese yen from 146.73 yen Tuesday. It 
traded at 146.90 yen in London, and at 146.40 yen in New York, down from 
146.905. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the pound rose to $1.5530 from $1.5470 late Tuesday. Sterling 
fetched $1.5585 in New York, up from $1.5485.

Prices of cotton futures skyrocketed on the New York Cotton Exchange, climbing 
as much as 2 cents a pound, the permitted daily limit, on fresh signs of 
shrinking world supplies.

<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell steeply, most energy futures 
advanced, and precious metals, livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures settled 1.13 to 2 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in October at 73.77 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was rooted partly in Tuesday's Agriculture Department crop report, 
which painted an ultimately bullish scenario for cotton although it was not 
apparent at first blush. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade in selling 
sparked by a higher 1989 wheat crop estimate and expectations for an increase 
in 1990 wheat acreage.

FIRM EXPANDS INTERNAL PROBE OF MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ENTERTAINMENT HIRES MORE LAWYERS IN MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>

<P>
Top executives of Live Entertainment, meeting with analysts to reassure them 
following the unexplained murder of the company's chairman, disclosed that a 
second law firm has been retained to assist with the internal investigation of 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Executives said they have hired the firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; 
Handler, which they said has no prior connection to the video and recorded 
music entertainment company. Pierce O'Donnell, a partner in the firm's Los 
Angeles office, will lead the investigation into the Aug. 20 murder of Jose E. 
Menendez and his wife at their Beverly Hills home, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter M. Hoffman, acting chairman and chief executive, said the investigation 
will look into the life of Menendez and past business activities of Live 
Entertainment and its subsidiaries. He said the firm had decided to give the 
investigation to Kaye Scholer on the advice of its regular law firm, Paul, 
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek New Chairman 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman also said that, while the company has heard nothing directly from 
Beverly Hills police, "sources" say the police "have absolutely no information 
as to the solution of this crime." 
</P>
<P>
Officials also disclosed that they have hired the executive search firms of 
Russell Reynolds Associates and Fell &amp; Associates to help search for a new 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told analysts that the murder "has no effect on the business . . . 
other than the loss of the man. . . . As an executive, he was as replaceable as 
we all are." 
</P>
<P>
On another topic, officials disclosed that Live Entertainment's earnings will 
fall below most analysts' earlier estimates for the year, due to a lack of 
major videocassette hits and top-selling new music albums. The firm expects to 
earn $1.40 a share, compared to a prevailing Wall Street estimate of $1.75 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading Wednesday, Live Entertainment stock dropped $1.125 
a share to close at $14.875. The Wednesday meeting with analysts occurred after 
the close of trading. The stock traded as high as $25 a share shortly before 
Menendez's death. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said there was no connection between the company's recent travails and 
the decision of a shareholder in Carolco, which owns a major block of Live 
Entertainment stock, to sell his shares. Andrew Vajna, a co-chairman of the 
movie production company, has decided to sell his nearly 36% stake because of 
"personal life choices and his decision to take a different role in the film 
business," Hoffman said. "Everybody close to the company knows it has nothing 
to do with problems in the business."

DEMONSTRATORS PROTEST SALE OF TIMBER GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About two dozen demonstrators filed into the Milwaukie, Ore., office of the 
Times Mirror Land &amp; Timber Co. on Wednesday to protest the sale of 
wildlife-rich old-growth timber for the lucrative export market. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrator Lydia Avery of Corvallis, Ore., urged the company to spare the 
grove, near Opal Creek and the Bull of the Woods Wilderness east of Salem, to 
provide habitat for the rare northern spotted owl and preserve the site of a 
historic mining claim. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Land &amp; Timber Co. is owned by Los Angeles-based Times Mirror 
Co., which also owns The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary optioned the property's timber rights to a Milwaukie man some 
time ago, Times Mirror Co. Executive Vice President Charles R. Redmond said, 
and the option is valid through September. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we can't do anything because the option is still out there," he 
said. "If the guy decides not to cut it -- and he may not, considering the 
ruckus -- we'll have to decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Redmond said he only recently learned of the potential value of the parcel as a 
wildlife habitat and said the company will consider ways to save the habitat, 
if possible, once it regains control of the property. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service biologist Steve Smith said the land, described by the 
company as 65 acres, is close to three spotted owl habitat areas. Logging is 
prohibited in designated habitat areas of federal forests to preserve the owl's 
living space. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Times Mirror's land itself is not restricted, but its use as a 
timber source may be limited in the future if the owl is found to be threatened 
with extinction and eligible for Endangered Species Act protection. The U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service is studying that issue, which also could restrict 
logging on millions of other acres from Canada to San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial land was left over after Times Mirror sold its Publishers 
Paper Co. subsidiary in 1986. Times Mirror retained 267,000 acres of timber in 
the deal but has since sold most of it to streamline operations. Redmond said 
about 2,000 acres -- mostly in small, scattered parcels -- remain to be sold.

* "Women and minorities hold the keys to America's future in science and 
technology," said Margarita Colmenares after she was installed as the first 
female president of the National Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. 
"If we don't invest in that segment of society, we risk losing our future." 
</P>
<P>
Colmenares, an engineer at Chevron Inc. and a Stanford graduate, added that 
"technological literacy can make a difference between those who have and those 
who have not." 
</P>
<P>
* "When I started telling the Hispanic population eight years ago that AIDS is 
here, they looked at me as though I were from outer space," said Eunice Diaz, 
the only Latino member of the National Commission on AIDS. "Now 42% of all 
cases are in the black and Latino communities. We can no longer remain in a 
state of denial." 
</P>
<P>
An assistant clinical professor at the USC School of Medicine, Diaz, of 
Cerritos, said she wants her role on the commission to be that of "an advocate 
for getting more AIDS education to all ethnic and racial groups in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
* Sal Lopez inherited organizing the Mexican Independence Day Parade in East 
Los Angeles from a fellow Rotarian 27 years ago. "And now I can't get rid of 
it," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old parade, now sponsored by the Mexican Civic Patriotic Committee, 
is at least 10 times as large as when he started, said Lopez, 75, a native of 
Los Angeles whose father immigrated to this country in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Mexican 4th of July," Lopez said. But the day probably only has 
significance for "the new immigrants," he said. "The ones who are born here 
have become Americanized. I don't think they get the idea that this celebrates 
Mexico's independence from Spain." EDWARD J. BOYER

Jamaica plans to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after a nine-year 
break, Prime Minister Michael Manley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview during an official visit to Rome, Manley said, "We are in 
discussion with them (Cubans) now, and when we've worked out the modalities, 
relations will be resumed." Asked when, he replied: "It will take a few 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Miniser Edward Seaga severed diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1980, 
accusing Havana of interference in Jamaica's internal affairs. Manley, a 
once-fiery socialist, assumed office in February.

Israeli Trade Minister Ariel Sharon on Wednesday defended his call for the 
assassination of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and 
drew a comparison with what he said was former President Ronald Reagan's 
attempt to kill Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain people whose activities cannot be tolerated by the free 
democratic society," he said. "Therefore, they should be removed in order to 
enable normal life to free society." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, speaking at a news conference sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace, said Reagan "took a step like that. Kadafi is one of these 
people, and the United States tried to kill him."

CREW RAZING GAS STATION SEVERS TELEPHONE CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A backhoe operator demolishing a gas station Wednesday morning accidentally cut 
two telephone cables, leaving more than 500 Pacific Bell customers without 
service until evening. 
</P>
<P>
The backhoe was being used by a work crew to unearth the station's three large 
gasoline storage tanks at Del Obispo Street and Camino Capistrano, according to 
telephone company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the cables got really chewed up," said George Travieso, a member of the 
the repair team that worked throughout the day to splice an estimated 1,000 
pairs of broken wires that stuck out of the 4-foot-deep hole left by the 
backhoe. 
</P>
<P>
Service to customers along Del Obispo, between Camino Capistrano and Ortega 
Highway, was restored at about 7 p.m., Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen 
said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carnes, another Pacific Bell representative, said the accident occurred 
because the contractor for the Southland Corp., which was supervising the 
demolition, had failed to notify utilities 48 hours ahead of time of its plan 
to unearth the tanks. Carnes said the fine for failing to report digging 
operations can be up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Manos, vice president of MacIntosh Construction, said he had neglected to 
notify the telephone company and conceded that the phone line was clearly 
marked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an accident," he said.

'SAFE, SANE' FIREWORKS BANNED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, the City Council this week banned the sale and use of so-called 
"safe and sane" fireworks. The ban is effective in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The action, taken at a City Council meeting late Tuesday, now leaves only six 
Orange County cities that allow fireworks: Garden Grove, Buena Park, Costa 
Mesa, Fullerton, Orange and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles V. Smith was joined by council members Lyn Gillespie and Anita 
Huseth in supporting the ban. Opposing the measure were council members Joy L. 
Neugebauer and Frank Fry Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Cathy Zoellner, who fought the ban, has promised to circulate enough 
petitions to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Banning the sale of safe and sane fireworks is not going to stop the bottle 
rockets and other illegal fireworks in Westminster," Zoellner said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like being told by the City Council, 'This is the way you're going to 
celebrate your Fourth of July.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zoellner said that in order to put the issue on a special election ballot next 
spring, she needs to gather about 3,700 signatures by Nov. 13.

RETARDED WOMAN FOUND UNHARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retarded 24-year-old woman missing since Saturday has been found unharmed at 
a Garden Grove motel a short distance from the mental-care facility where she 
lived, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kara McElravy, 24, was last seen walking near Petite Amis, a facility for 
retarded adults, in the 13000 block of Wilson Street in Garden Grove. Police 
had feared foul play when she failed to return Saturday night, according to 
Garden Grove Police Investigator Mike Handfield. 
</P>
<P>
Handfield said McElravy was in a motel lobby Saturday when she struck up a 
conversation with a young man checking in. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt sorry for her and she said she was hungry, so he bought her dinner," 
Handfield said. The man was aware that McElravy, who functions at the level of 
a 13-year-old, had problems but did not know that she had been reported 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, she met this nice guy," Handfield said. "She stayed in the room 
with him. He even took her to Knott's Berry Farm." 
</P>
<P>
Acting on several tips from the public, police handed out flyers bearing 
McElravy's photo near the intersection of Beach and Garden Grove boulevards. 
Employees at a Coco's restaurant recognized the picture and called police when 
the man returned to ask for change, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The man led police to his motel room, where McElravy was found watching 
television.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOS ALAMITOS;

<P>
TIMETABLE FOR SCHOOL CROSSING SIGNAL ASKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried about the safety of students crossing the street in front of Los 
Alamitos High School, the City Council has asked the city staff for a timetable 
on installing a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
The council stopped short of approving money for the Cerritos Avenue project, 
deciding a better time to do so would be in January, when the item could be 
added to the midyear budget. 
</P>
<P>
A painted crosswalk in front of the school was removed in the spring after a 
student was struck by a car while using the crosswalk. The student was not 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided the painted crosswalk was not always visible to motorists 
and gave students a "false sense of security" in crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
Signs have been posted instead, warning students not to jaywalk, said Mike 
Brotemarkle, city community development director. Students must now cross at 
Humbolt Street or Los Alamitos Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There is still some debate as to what sort of crossing will be used, but "that 
one design aspect" could be determined at a later date, Councilman Ronald Bates 
said at the council meeting this week.

JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK DAYWORKER ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge Wednesday refused to block enforcement of a 
controversial Costa Mesa dayworker ordinance, clearing the way for police to 
begin arresting people who appear to be soliciting work on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union had sought a temporary restraining order to 
prevent prosecution under the ordinance, arguing that the measure is vague and 
does not provide guidelines on what is unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk ruled that the ACLU failed to 
show that the ordinance would cause immediate harm to citizens. Cimbaluk did, 
however, set an Oct. 24 hearing date to consider arguments on whether the 
measure is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder said the city would begin enforcing the 
measure immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it is technically in effect, we have an obligation to carry out the 
ordinance unless directed by the City Council or the courts otherwise," Roeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure singles out three areas of the city known for having the heaviest 
concentrations of day laborers: Lion's Park, 18th Street and Harbor Boulevard, 
and Santa Ana Avenue and East 20th Street. 
</P>
<P>
It prohibits anyone from being at those sites with the "intent to solicit 
employment from the occupant of a motor vehicle." According to the ordinance, 
police can arrest people based on "circumstantial evidence" even if they are 
not able to catch violators in the act. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Rebecca Jurado argued that the measure infringes on freedoms of 
speech, thought and association guaranteed under the First Amendment and will 
be used to discriminate against Latinos, who make up the vast majority of those 
looking for daywork. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be harassed," Jurado said after Wednesday's hearing. "The people 
targeted are Latinos in the park. I don't see on what basis (police) will be 
able to determine intent." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the ordinance, however, say it is needed because other measures, 
including a city-sponsored hiring hall, have failed to eliminate problems 
allegedly caused by gatherings of dayworkers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have large numbers of (residents) who feel their park is gone, when 
they are concerned about passing by these locations, then the law is needed," 
Mayor Peter F. Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance took effect Sept. 6, but police had not begun enforcing it. Buffa 
argued that it is enforceable and would not be used selectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can demonstrate that in those cases where we have cited someone 
that we have done our homework and there is a clear-cut demonstration of 
intent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, police officials have conceded that it will be difficult to determine 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spent quite a lot of time looking at the elements of the intent 
portion, and it is a gray area to us," Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
One city employee familiar with police operations went further and said 
authorities will not try to determine intent but will rely on a portion of the 
ordinance that bans curb-side soliciting of employment. 
</P>
<P>
"The (intent portion) is pretty meaningless," said the employee, who asked that 
his name not be used. "It's one thing to say somebody intends to do something 
but another to build a case around that and prove it in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, would-be employers can easily circumvent the law by simply parking 
and getting out of their cars to negotiate, the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Kent said tentative plans call for "careful observation" by officers who are 
familiar with the illegal alien population. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the officers who will be out there can determine from past experience 
and what is happening in front of them, who is there and what they are 
intending to do," Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are also considering the use of video cameras and undercover 
officers to catch violators, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle, who voted against the measure, condemned such 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hassling' Citizens 
</P>
<P>
"We depend heavily on these workers in many ways and, in fact, many are here 
legally," she said. "What we are doing is hassling one set of citizens to 
appease another set, and that is not a very good way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
And a spokesman for an immigrants-rights group argued that city officials are 
singling out a group that has few resources to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
"People standing on a street corner make an easy target for a council that 
can't face up to the fact that businesses in the city continue to hire these 
workers," said Carlos Holguin, an attorney with the National Center for 
Immigrants Rights. "It's a matter of political clout. But fundamentally, it's a 
matter of economics: If people weren't finding work on the streets, they 
wouldn't be looking for it." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's victory follows a setback in the city's bid to rid the streets of 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the city grudgingly accepted a recommendation by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and suspended another controversial policy that 
withheld funds from groups that aid illegals. 
</P>
<P>
The policy may conflict with federal anti-discrimination guidelines, HUD 
officials who are reviewing the measure have said.

230 UCI STUDENTS SCRAMBLING AFTER KEY COURSE IS AXED WITHOUT NOTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A writing course required for graduation, for which 230 UC Irvine students had 
signed up, has been canceled without notice, less than two weeks before the 
start of the fall quarter, because of a clerical error, university officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien, who learned of the mix-up Wednesday, 
said that "space will be made available for all who signed up" for the course. 
It was unclear, however, how the students would be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, discovered early this week, occurred after Humanities Dean Terence 
D. Parsons approved cutting 10 classes of English and Comparative Literature 
(Writing 39) because of budget constraints. But the university registrar was 
not notified of the cancellations before class scheduling was done by computer 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
230 Falsely Enrolled 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 230 students, mostly freshmen, were enrolled in classes that do 
not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said Wednesday that some of those class sections may be restored, and 
other classes might be enlarged. In addition, he said, he will petition Tien's 
office for more money. 
</P>
<P>
"We will shift resources from anticipated needs in the winter and spring" to 
provide for the writing students, he said. "I can't say we're averting 
problems. Maybe we're postponing them." 
</P>
<P>
Urgent concerns remain about students who may not be able to fit an alternate 
course into their class schedules. If any fall below full-time enrollment 
status, they could lose eligibility for financial aid and campus housing. 
</P>
<P>
"If the students had been notified early enough, they wouldn't be registering 
for this class," UCI ombudsman Ronald Wilson said. "Now, students are going to 
come to their assigned classes expecting Writing 39A, and it's not going to be 
there. We'll have 200 students scurrying around trying to get into new classes. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is what happens if student financial aid is affected, or if 
students lose their housing. We can't predict the impact yet." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the problem will not be known until Monday, when the first 
students arrive on campus for orientation week and the add-drop phase of 
registration. A record 16,400 undergraduate and graduate students are expected 
for the fall quarter, which will begin Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying issues, however, are philosophical and financial: whether 
courses needed for graduation should be cut and how universities should use 
scarce dollars when enrollment and faculty growth outpace state budget 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Tien said Wednesday that required classes are a high priority and that Writing 
39A, one of three options to fulfill a university English requirement, is 
particularly important. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said he cut the writing sections and added other composition classes 
because UCI freshman enrollment for the fall will be slightly lower than 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Squeeze Described 
</P>
<P>
He also said he is forced to make do with a university allocation that is just 
4% larger than last year's but includes 10 more humanities faculty members, a 
new department plus increased enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that cutting the 10 writing classes would save $32,000 to $35,000 
-- roughly the starting pay for an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a poor year, and this year is worse," Parsons said. "It is 
affecting almost all our courses -- we're turning students away from 
philosophy, foreign languages, English, almost everywhere. The tightness in my 
budget comes from tightness in the university's budget."

SUPERVISORS PRAISE BUT WITHHOLD APPROVAL OF BOYS TOWN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While expressing support for Boys Town USA's proposal to build five homes in 
Trabuco Canyon for troubled and needy youths, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors on Wednesday sent the project back to the Planning Commission for a 
new environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
The commission approved the project in August, prompting a preservationist 
group, the Rural Canyons Conservation Fund, to file a lawsuit charging that the 
project violated zoning guidelines for grading and ridgeline development in the 
area northeast of Mission Viejo. Environmentalists also wanted Boys Town USA to 
explain what it plans to do with the portion of its 76-acre parcel that is not 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
Boys Town USA spent $1.6 million last year to buy the property and develop its 
first campus in the western United States to care for abused and neglected 
youths. The group, encouraged by the county's Social Services Agency to locate 
here, has proposed building five 3,900-square-foot homes on five acres along a 
ridge between Rose and Hickey canyons not far from Trabuco Canyon Road. About 
six to eight youths ages 9 to 15 would live in each house. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists argue that the group has enough acreage to build the homes on 
flatter land, where they would be less visible and cause less disruption to 
wildlife habitat and views. There are also concerns that the group might 
develop single-family homes on the rest of the acreage. 
</P>
<P>
In praising the project, supervisors sent the project back to the Planning 
Commission for additional study to satisfy community concerns about its impact. 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also suggested that the five Boys Town homes be 
built on a minimum of three acres each to provide more open space. 
</P>
<P>
A Boys Town USA representative said the group has no intention of developing 
the balance of its property in the near future.

WATER FROM RUPTURED HYDRANT WASHES BODY OUT OF A DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A badly decomposed body washed out of a storm drain in Anaheim on Wednesday 
after a car hit a hydrant, sending water gushing into the drain, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was believed to have been in the drain for about three or four months, 
according to Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an educated guess," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said there was no immediate indication of foul play. "There's 
nothing obvious at this point," Barry said. "Of course, that's pending an 
autopsy." 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office will perform an autopsy today,. 
</P>
<P>
A car hit the hydrant at about 12:15 p.m. in the 1700 block of South Walnut 
Street. The impact sent water gushing down the street and into the drain. About 
30 minutes later, a passer-by found the body, which had been washed into a 
nearby flood-control channel near the 1500 block of West Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said investigators have not positively determined the gender or race of 
the dead person, but he added: "We are reasonably sure it was a male." 
</P>
<P>
Police plan to send information about the body to missing-persons units in the 
area, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't come across any information in the near future, we might have to 
extend that," he said.

TRADING PLACES: LOS ALAMITOS, NOT SERVITE, IS THE TEAM TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most seasons, a game against Servite High School would be the highlight of Los 
Alamitos' schedule. It's a chance to play one of the powerhouses of Orange 
County football, a chance to draw a big crowd and attract a lot of headlines, 
particularly if the Griffins could pull off an upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Los Alamitos is the top-ranked team in the county. The 
Griffins' roster is filled with high-profile players. They're the ones drawing 
all the attention this time around. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the line scrimmage will be a Servite team that has a new 
coach and a cast of young, unproven players. The teams meet in the county's 
featured game at 7:30 tonight at Gahr High in Cerritos and it's Servite that 
will be hoping for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty big game for both of us," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said. 
"It gives them something to really shoot for. If the shoe was on the other 
foot, it would be the same way. I'm sure they're using this as a great 
motivating factor, as a stepping stone to a great season. I'm sure a win for 
them would be a great feather in Coach (Larry) Toner's cap." 
</P>
<P>
Servite opened its first season with Toner as coach with a 21-0 victory over 
Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Toner, an assistant at Servite during the 1960s, '70s and '80s, had missed out 
on the Friars' recent tradition. He was coaching in Portland before moving back 
to Servite this season. 
</P>
<P>
He never saw Derek Brown run with the ball or linebacker Garrett Greedy chase 
down a ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what I missed," Toner said. "There's no point of 
reference." 
</P>
<P>
But Toner's been pleased by what he has seen so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Mike Wallock rushed for 55 yards, caught four passes for 28 more 
and scored a touchdown last week. The Friar defense held Wilson to 117 yards in 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the fact that the boys didn't have exceptional first-game jitters, 
especially with a new staff," Toner said. "A lot of boys played varsity 
football for the first time. There were a lot of big, big question marks. I was 
pleased with how they did the first time out." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos also had an easy opening night, beating Marina, 42-22. Quarterback 
Todd Gragnano passed for 280 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffin defense, led by defensive lineman Hart Brown, looked better than 
Barnes had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little better on defense than I thought we'd be," Barnes said. "It's 
the youngest defense we've had. We have a lot juniors and sophomores. We were a 
lot quicker and tougher than I thought. That was a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Other games at 7:30 tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (0-1) vs. Woodbridge (1-0) at Irvine High: Foothill started the regime 
of Coach Marty McWhinney by losing, 17-6, to Tustin, its bitter cross-town 
rival. The Knights lost four fumbles and gained just 115 yards. Woodbridge made 
Coach Gene Noji's return from a one-year sabbatical a successful one as the 
Warriors beat San Clemente, 24-12. Quarterback Gary Fishel, who threw for 142 
yards, is a key to the Warriors' fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (1-0) vs. Pacifica (0-0-1) at Bolsa Grande High: Huntington 
Beach, which upset defending Southern Section Division VIII champion Corona del 
Mar, looks as if its going to be a contender in the tough Sunset League. The 
Oilers won just two games last season, but with players like running backs Doug 
Cunningham and Kelly Cotton, there is a renewed excitement at Huntington Beach. 
Pacifica was tied, 14-14, in its opener by Santa Ana Valley. Quarterback Bobby 
Anderson, who threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns last week, is one Pacifica 
player to keep an eye on. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (1-0) vs. Saddleback (0-1) at Santa Ana Stadium: This is a battle for 
Santa Ana city bragging rights and is one of the harder-hitting nonleague games 
you will see. Santa Ana got its season off to fast start, but nearly blew a 
21-8 halftime lead. Oscar Wilson, a defensive lineman, is one of the best 
football players in Orange County this season. Saddleback is looking for an 
upset after losing its opener, 24-7, to Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora (1-0) at Valencia (1-0): Sonora hasn't been very good in the in the 
1980s, but after the first week of play anyway, the Raiders have a winning 
record. Linebacker Scott Sanders, who returned a blocked punt for a touchdown 
in last week's 21-18 victory over Northview, is a Division I college prospect. 
The Raiders face stiffer competition this week. Valencia's tradition of 
hard-nosed teams appears as if it will continue again this season. The Tigers 
defeated Bellflower, 35-6, last week. Richard Wells' debut at quarterback was a 
smash as he completed 12 of 17 passes for 158 yards.

NCAA TIP SENT ELLIS RUNNIN' TO SYRACUSE, REPORT SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Kentucky star LeRon Ellis decided to attend Syracuse University rather 
than the University of Nevada Las Vegas because he was alerted to the NCAA's 
investigation of the Runnin' Rebels basketball program, according to a report 
published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, a former standout at Mater Dei High School, told the Syracuse 
Herald-Journal that he spoke with "a couple" of National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. investigators during the governing body's probe into the Kentucky program 
who told him about the NCAA's review of the UNLV program. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-11 Ellis announced July 17 that he was transferring to Syracuse from 
Kentucky, which has received three years probation for recruiting violations. 
Because of the NCAA penalty, Ellis is immediately available to play at 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the summer, Ellis had said that UNLV was his first choice. The 
school announced July 21 that it was under investigation by the NCAA concerning 
the recruiting of former New York City player Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said he questioned the NCAA investigators about UNLV's future and was 
told the Rebels might be headed for the same punishment as Kentucky. That 
conversation caused him to change his mind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only reason I changed my mind. The only reason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian told the newspaper that he had heard nothing of 
Ellis' contact with the NCAA, but that he had wondered why Ellis changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He committed to us verbally. We were really shocked when there was a 
turnaround," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Jim Marchiony said the NCAA allows investigators to speak to recruits 
if the school in question has been notified of a pending investigation.

As special adviser for consumer affairs to President Bush, Bonnie Guiton is 
well versed in complaints about the credit industry. But it didn't really hit 
home until her request for extra credit was turned down because a charge card 
had been issued in her name to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Guiton called the problem to the attention of Orange-based 
TRW Credit Data, the firm that issued her credit report. TRW corrected the 
error, and Guiton assumed the matter was settled. But she was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Visiting a credit bureau just this week, I discovered that inaccurate, 
negative information was still there," Guiton told the consumer affairs 
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee on 
Wednesday. "Apparently the fact there was inaccurate information on my report 
had not been disseminated to other bureaus." 
</P>
<P>
Guiton said her experience was representative of the problems faced by millions 
of American consumers as the increasing sophistication of the nation's credit 
information industry eclipses the protections provided by the Federal Credit 
Reporting Act of 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Guiton, one of 15 witnesses to testify before the House panel, encouraged 
lawmakers to mandate new consumer education measures and to place limitations 
on the use of credit information to generate mailing lists and consumer 
profiles -- a recent innovation that has caused a "proliferation of the 
invasion of privacy," in the words of one witness. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, representatives of other consumer protection groups testified, a 
typical consumer may be the subject of files kept by each of the three major 
credit bureaus: TRW in Orange County; Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, Ga., and Trans 
Union Corp. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, the three credit giants have 400 million records on 180 million 
people. In addition, about 200 smaller, independent bureaus compile consumer 
credit files. And even that is not the end of the credit trail. 
</P>
<P>
"On a daily basis," said Elgie Holstein, executive director of the Bankcard 
Holders of America, "the personal financial information stored in credit bureau 
files is sliced, diced and sorted using a variety of sophisticated programs to 
generate mailing lists and consumer profiles." 
</P>
<P>
Those so-called pre-screening programs, several witnesses said, violate the 
letter and law of the 19-year-old federal credit law, which was adopted to 
protect personal privacy of credit information. 
</P>
<P>
But the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, has not halted the practice, mainly because of the vague 
nature of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The act forbids credit agencies from sharing credit data with anyone but an 
authorized customer. The law grants consumers the right to review their credit 
records and to receive notice of credit investigations. But it allows agencies 
to authorize sales of credit information to any customer who has a "legitimate 
business need" to review it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Edmund Mierzwinski, a consumer lobbyist with the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group: "This opacity has resulted in a situation in which the industry 
has dangerously expanded its sphere of influence over the control, use and sale 
of personal information, while federal oversight has not kept pace with changes 
in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the credit industry argued, however, that only minor 
revisions in the law are needed. "We believe that the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
stands as one of Congress' most successful products," said Edward A. Barbieri, 
vice president and general manager of TRW Credit Data. "It has worked 
extraordinarily well in protecting the interests of the financial consumer and 
of the credit grantor for some 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Added John Baker, senior vice president of Equifax: "It has stood the test of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer activists and credit agency officials agreed on one aspect of the 
reform movement -- education. 
</P>
<P>
"From our experiences, the vast majority of consumers are not aware of their 
rights and do not concern themselves until they are confronted with a problem," 
said G. Douglas Edwards, president of Kentucky-based Credit Bureau Systems Inc. 
"Most certainly, greater emphasis could be placed on education of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, consumers rarely understand the implications of the blanket 
authorizations they sign when they apply for credit, insurance or a job," said 
Guiton, the presidential adviser. "Most consumers don't even understand a 
credit reporting agency's function and, of those who do, most believe there is 
a single (credit reporting agency) for their community, or even for the whole 
country."

THREE D TALKS MERGER WITH LINENS PLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three D Departments Inc., a Costa Mesa-based operator of a bed-and-bath chain, 
is discussing a possible merger with Linens Plus Inc., Three D executives said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the merger is completed, Linens Plus -- a retailer with eight linen 
specialty stores in Phoenix -- would be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Three D. 
</P>
<P>
Three D operates 26 Three D Bed &amp; Bath stores in California and 
Connecticut, nine of them in Orange County. The company is traded on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Under the possible merger announced Wednesday, Linens Plus principal 
shareholders Norman Goldman and Lynn Levin would continue to operate the Linens 
Plus stores, with buying conducted from Three D's Orange County headquarters. 
Linens Plus stores would keep their name. 
</P>
<P>
Three D, which is run by a father-and-son executive team, moved from East 
Hartford, Conn., into Orange County headquarters in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty retailer had a net loss of $71,304 in the third quarter ended 
April 29. For the first nine months of fiscal 1989, the company posted net 
income of $639,985, up very slightly from the comparable period last year. New 
and expanded Three D Bed &amp; Bath stores helped sales for the nine months 
rise 14.8% to $29.5 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Three D said it hopes to complete the deal early next year.

AILING COMPCARE OF IRVINE OKS OFFER TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acquisition of Comprehensive Care Corp., the nation's largest provider of 
hospital drug- and alcohol-treatment services, by First Hospital Corp. was 
approved Wednesday by shareholders of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting to approve the $110-million deal, CompCare Chairman B. Lee 
Karns told shareholders that the Irvine-based company needs First Hospital's 
management capability and access to capital. 
</P>
<P>
The new company will be known as FHC-CompCare Inc. and will have headquarters 
in Virginia. It will employ 7,000 people, own $367 million in assets and 
generate about $311 million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald I. Dozoretz, First Hospital's chairman, said he expects to gradually 
cure CompCare's declining profits by eliminating CompCare's $15-million annual 
media-advertising budget, emphasizing "hands-on" community marketing and 
offering a wider menu of treatment plans. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger, Karns will step down as chairman and Dozoretz will serve 
as chairman and chief executive officer of the combined companies. Karns will 
serve as a member of FHC-CompCare's board of directors.

ALR SAYS ITS PC IS FIRST TO USE NEW DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advanced Logic Research Inc. of Irvine has announced a new personal computer 
that it says is the first to use a new computer design standard. 
</P>
<P>
The ALR machine uses a new design for controlling how the various parts of a 
computer communicate with each other. The design was established a year ago as 
a collaborative effort by a group of leading PC manufacturers seeking to 
challenge International Business Machines' dominance of industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although ALR is the first PC maker to trot out a product using the alternative 
design, a company spokesperson said the machines won't be ready to ship to 
customers until November. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy Corp. and AST Research 
Inc., have said they also plan to offer products using the new design. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq plans to bring out a machine with the new design by the end of 1989. But 
the company "doesn't announce products before we're ready to ship them," said 
spokesman John Sweney. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ashbrook, an AST senior vice president, said the Irvine-based company is 
developing a machine that will use the new standard. However, computer chips 
that will enable PC manufacturers to build the machines are not expected to be 
available in large volumes until later this year from Intel Corp., a Silicon 
Valley semiconductor company. 
</P>
<P>
AST and Compaq were members of the so-called "Gang of Nine" group of PC makers 
that announced last year a joint development project to come up with a new 
computer "bus," or data pathway, for the industry. The design was proposed as 
an alternative to IBM's Micro Channel bus, which is used inside that company's 
Personal System/2 line.

ATTILA THE HUN -- ROLE MODEL FOR LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY SKRZYCKI, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leadership, and how to create leaders, has become a hot craze for everyone from 
consultants to chief executive officers. Training seminars now use leadership 
as a theme and an assortment of how-to and inspirational books on leadership is 
hitting the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
Two approaches not to be overlooked in this derby mirror the dramatic 
differences in management styles of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
One is the frontal approach to leadership: Take charge, be aggressive, ferret 
out your enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The other is kinder and gentler: Treat people well and look for the good in 
them, and they will respond in productive and creative ways. 
</P>
<P>
Attila the Hun, meet Max DePree. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun," written by Wess Roberts, a human 
resources professional at Fireman's Fund Insurance, is a 110-page leadership 
manual based on the life and "work" of Attila, King of Huns, a 5th-Century 
brutalizer and bully of men and nations who relished being known as the Scourge 
of God. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who picked Attila as his metaphorical leader because of the warrior's 
"mystical" qualities, softens Attila's rough edges, painting him as a 
deliberate (if driven), compassionate leader who may have been crude but also 
was wise -- particularly in how he handled subordinates (the Huns). 
</P>
<P>
"Some of his methods may seem brutal in our day . . . but, hey, that's how 
things were done," said Roberts. Consider these "Attila-isms": 
</P>
<P>
* Do not let your chosen enemy have the advantage in any situation. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not insult unless you mean it. 
</P>
<P>
* For Huns, conflict is a natural state. 
</P>
<P>
* -- Huns make enemies only on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
* If it were easy to be a chieftain, everyone would be one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovered From Slow Start 
</P>
<P>
The book got off to a slow start -- 16 publishers turned it down before Warner 
Books took it on. Its outlook turned more bullish after it fell into the hands 
of H. Ross Perot, a modern-day corporate Attila, who touts it as a great book 
with timeless principles. The book hit the best-seller lists and is being 
translated into 13 languages. It's also being made into a film for business and 
is available on cassette. 
</P>
<P>
If the curious appeal of "Attila" lies in its simplistic pronouncements and 
outrageous presentation, quite the opposite is true of "Leadership Is an Art." 
Written by Max DePree, the 64-year-old chairman of Herman Miller Inc., a 
designer and maker of office furniture, the book is small and soulful enough to 
be carried around like a prayer book -- and, in some respects, it is. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong spiritual content to leadership," DePree said. "People make 
a decision to follow, but we don't quite know why they do." 
</P>
<P>
DePree has decided that leadership is akin to being in a state of grace -- it 
is a sort of gift given to someone who then has the obligation to serve. His 
meditations, which are drawn from Luke, the Corinthians, Plato, Gandhi and his 
own experience, are perhaps more daring in spirit than all of Attila's bluster. 
Consider these musings: 
</P>
<P>
* The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
* By ourselves we suffer serious limitations. Together we can be something 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
* Intimacy is one way of describing the relationship we all desire with work. 
</P>
<P>
* An elegant company frees its members to be their best. 
</P>
<P>
DePree also shares some novel approaches to performance reviews in which he 
proposes that some of the "right" questions to be asked are: "Does Herman 
Miller need you?"; "Do you need Herman Miller?"; and "What have you abandoned?" 
</P>
<P>
DePree also thinks leaders should have the capacity to weep over the good and 
the bad, the happy and the sad in life and at work. Things that bring tears to 
his eyes include superficiality, a lack of dignity, arrogance, tenderness, good 
news and having to work in a job where you are not free to do your best.

SMALLEYS WIDEN SCOPE OF JUDAISM UNIVERSITY'S ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sondra and Marvin Smalley 18 years ago chose the late architect A. Quincy 
Jones, dean of the USC School of Architecture, to build their contemporary 
house in Holmby Hills. With 26-foot ceilings and wrap-around random-designed 
rough-sawn cedar slat walls, they added a new dimension to their lives -- art. 
</P>
<P>
The house's spectacular spaces -- both open and walled -- allowed for gigantic 
canvases. And the Smalleys began acquiring pieces by Ronald Davis, Tony DeLap, 
Dan Citron and Sam Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an interest in art, but we had not been collecting. It was Quincy who 
exposed us to more in life -- he was a sensational man. And he liked this house 
so much that his memorial service was held here for 400 people," Marvin Smalley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Smalleys are helping to create the Sondra and Marvin Smalley Family 
Sculpture Garden at the University of Judaism whose campus at 15600 Mulholland 
Drive is known as the Isadore and Sunny Familian Campus in honor of her father 
and late mother. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the Smalleys will be at the forefront of the Sculptor's Ball for a 
black-tie evening of dining and dancing at the campus. The affair honors Robert 
Graham, the sculptor who designed the 1984 Olympics statue at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum, the Memorial to Joe Lewis in Detroit and the tribute to jazz legend 
Duke Ellington in Central Park in New York. They hope to gross $150,000 and net 
$100,000 for new acquisitions. "We want to make the garden grow," says Sandy 
Smalley. 
</P>
<P>
The garden, a place where students and visitors gather to study, talk and enjoy 
nature, already has four pieces -- an Aldo Casanova bronze donated by Julius 
and Hannah Karosen, a Fletcher Benton given by Jerry and Gloria Lushing, a 
George Rickey given in memory of the Holocaust by 10 donors and a marble bench 
etched with truisms by Jenny Holzer ("Action causes more trouble than thought" 
and "Knowledge should be advanced at all costs") and presented by Nancy Epstein 
and the Smalleys. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Judaism is an academic institution with only 200 students and 
a curriculum dedicated to the study and advancement of Jewish life. More than 
5,000 are also enrolled in adult education classes. Said Sondra Smalley, "The 
university is one of those best-kept secrets. With this event, chaired by Roy 
Norris, we are trying to reach out to a much broader base." 
</P>
<P>
The Smalleys were married when she was 17 and he 21. They met when she was 14 
and he had just started UCLA and was working weekends delivering flowers. He 
brought a bouquet to her front door and it was love at first sight. They've 
been married 37 years and have four grown children. 
</P>
<P>
Says Marvin, "Sandy never had a station wagon, because I didn't want her to get 
totally engrossed in the children. When I came home from the office, I didn't 
want to hear about carpools. We always had a half hour quality time by 
ourselves when I got home." 
</P>
<P>
She says, "And we still do a lot of things together. We don't get tired of each 
other." They conscientiously plan two big trips a year, now that he is 
semi-retired but still involved with real estate and securities investing. They 
also are frequently in Rancho Mirage at their home at Mission Hills Country 
Club, playing golf, going to movies, enjoying friends, "doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
And Sandy's favorite indulgence is two hours of gardening each morning -- a 
portrait in her nightgown and robe and rubber shoes. She also does fund-raising 
for the Museum of Contemporary Art and is a trustee of the Municipal Art 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin's love is the piano. Says Sandy, "He listens to a cassette a couple of 
times and comes down and plays it all from ear. He's wonderful."

NOT A 'NORMAL' FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR DAUGHTERS (AND NO SONS) -- AND A MILLION REASONS WHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH F. PISANI, The Greenwich Time 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of studying the mating habits of married couples, several 
distinguished social scientists have concluded the "normal" American family 
consists of one boy and one girl. 
</P>
<P>
This major scientific discovery, which was based on exhaustive research with 
their Nintendo sets, proves something I've known all along: My family is not 
normal. In fact, my family, which consists of one wife, one collie, four 
children (all girls) and two goldfish (sex unknown) is nowhere near "the norm." 
</P>
<P>
This ground-breaking demographic research also revealed there is a "preference 
for boys" in this country, according to a recently published report in 
Demography, the journal of the Population Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, couples who have sons are "slightly more likely to stay married" 
because fathers are usually more involved with their sons than with their 
daughters, and this creates the strong family ties necessary to hold a marriage 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Several other studies have shown that couples who have a daughter first are 
more likely to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
So after weighing all the evidence, I had to conclude that having four 
daughters and no sons means I'm either four times more likely to get a divorce 
or four times more likely to stay married -- if you take into account the 
"child-support corollary." 
</P>
<P>
When people see our four daughters, ages 2 to 9, they usually ask: "You were 
trying for a son, right? And you kept having daughters, right? And you felt 
genetically deficient -- not quite a man -- because you couldn't produce a son, 
and pretty soon you realized it'd be easier to win Lotto than have a boy, so 
after four girls, you finally gave up and decided to raise goldfish, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong. Wrong. Entirely wrong. I was actually trying for the Lennon Sisters," I 
respond, and then make it clear I don't share their "preference for boys," 
usually by uttering a few choice words. 
</P>
<P>
Some people pursue a different line of interrogation and ask if we came into 
this windfall of children because my wife was on fertility drugs and had 
triplets. Why else would anyone have four (never mind what sex they are) kids 
in this day and age? Others inquire whether the four girls were the products of 
two marriages, sort of like the Brady Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
And there are those who ask personal questions like, "Couldn't you exercise 
some self-restraint?" or "Pardon me, but have you heard of the exciting new 
concept called 'family planning'? Here's my card. Call me. We'll do lunch." 
</P>
<P>
When we walk into a restaurant, a murmur usually rushes through the crowd, and 
people stop slurping their soup to stare at us with linguini hanging from their 
chins while the grandmotherly matriarchs chortle, "Oh, how cute, four little 
girls!" And the yuppie materialists sneer, "Bad investments, very bad 
investments. He'll have to pay for their college education, and then they'll 
only get married and he'll have to pay for the weddings; besides, there's a 
shortage of available men, so even the marriage prospects don't look good 
demographically." 
</P>
<P>
Most people can't understand why anyone would want four kids in this 
enlightened era of moderation and limited financial resources, not to mention 
stock market volatility and high tuition costs. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever my wife was pregnant and I announced the news to my co-workers, they'd 
look at one another and roll their eyes and whisper things like, "Are they 
looking for tax write-offs? Investment property would be a better deal." 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy not being "normal." I admit that every so often, we envy our 
friends who have 1.5 kids -- one son and half a daughter -- because they get to 
vacation in Anguilla while we're assembling swing sets and throwing peanuts to 
squirrels at the park. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we should have consulted a financial planner or at least an astrologer 
before we went ahead and started recklessly procreating. Maybe we should have 
had a long-range plan, sort of like Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could say, "After consulting our accountant and the parish priest and 
Planned Parenthood and after getting dispensation from Zero Population Growth 
and a blessing from the National Organization for Women, we figured we could 
afford to raise four daughters if we invested in AAA-rated debentures for 30 
years at 8.3% and saw a marriage counselor and a family therapist twice a week 
and struggled through the teen years until we reached retirement when our kids 
could support us." But that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, you can't see The Total Picture when you start a family. If you 
could preview parenthood from start to finish like a strategic corporate plan, 
it would be so terrifying, married couples would probably take the vow of 
celibacy to avoid the cost of raising kids and providing food, shelter and 
Barbie accessories, and to escape the debilitating parental fear that 
somewhere, somehow something has to go wrong, and the painful fact of life that 
kids don't always turn out the way you'd like them to. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, sometimes they do. And they sure can carry on better 
conversations than goldfish.

"My mother suggested that I come here," said Junya Iyori, giving a shy glance 
at the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I tried to speak with girls, I'd choke on words. I also had bad sense 
of fashion," said the 34-year-old bachelor, who works for a shipping company 
and has tried at least three times to find a bride through omiai, or the 
Japanese arranged marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Iyori is one of 50 bachelors who gets help from Marriage Man Academy, a 
finishing school for men that opened recently in Osaka, Japan's third largest 
city, west of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strictly for Men 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the typical Japanese finishing schools, where women are taught how to 
become good housewives, the academy teaches men how to communicate with women 
and assume a realistic relationship with them. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall behind Iyori's seat in the class room is a poster with five 
principles of the "bridegroom school": 
</P>
<P>
*Do not cringe to a woman. 
</P>
<P>
*Do not underestimate a woman. 
</P>
<P>
*Try to understand a woman. 
</P>
<P>
*Be open to a woman. 
</P>
<P>
*Have confidence in yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those principles, the academy's 22-step, six-month course gives 
bachelors like Iyori lessons such as how to make a good first impression, how 
to have a good sense of humor, how to understand women's feelings and what to 
do during the first meeting in an arranged marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Daily seminars and counseling programs also allow a man who cannot afford to 
wait six months to learn some quick techniques to capture the heart of the 
"girl of his dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we teach our students is how to introduce themselves," said 
Satoshi Noguchi, founder and instructor of the Academy. "But it takes at least 
four weeks for them to speak out loud enough for us to hear." 
</P>
<P>
In most of the lessons, students practice Noguchi's technique with female 
instructors. In the sense of humor class, they are told to give a popular 
stand-up comedy routine in front of the instructors. Unless they can make the 
audience laugh, the outlook for them may be very gloomy, said Noguchi. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy also gives students professional advice on hair styling and how to 
dress well. Though they are mostly salaried workers in their late 20s to early 
30s, many still live with their parents, who often are just as desperate about 
their son's single status. 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls from parents asking us what exactly we teach to their sons," 
Noguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, boys are urged to study efficiently, get into an important university 
and be hired by a respectable company. Studying hard often consumes so much 
time and attention that it is impossible for boys to go out with girls. When it 
becomes necessary for them to have relationships with women, they are 
completely at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Why are bachelors like Iyori so anxious to find a bride? 
</P>
<P>
Men hold a strong desire to get married because otherwise they feel incomplete. 
They also need someone who will cook, clean and raise children, skills they 
were not taught. 
</P>
<P>
In some companies, a man who remains single -- thereby failing to show off the 
most basic ability the society demands -- could forfeit his chances to be 
promoted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Odds 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the odds are against single men in Japan. According to the 1985 
national census, the number of single men between the ages of 25 to 34 was 3.6 
million -- more than double the number of single women in the same age group. 
</P>
<P>
"Men basically haven't realized the changes in women," said Keiko Higuchi, 
professor of women's studies at Tokyo Kasei University. "They're still looking 
for a wife who will do everything for them." 
</P>
<P>
Higuchi will offer a lecture course titled "Hanamuko Gakko," or "school for 
bridegrooms," at a marriage-counseling center in Tokyo. In her lectures, she 
will teach her male students the women's view of the changes in society and the 
female role. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days women would have married such men because they had to have 
financial support," said Noguchi of Marriage Man Academy. "But now that many of 
them are financially independent, they have a wider choice of enjoyable things 
to do other than getting married." 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1988 Labor Ministry's white paper on working women, there were 
16 million women who held either full-time or part-time jobs in 1987. The 
number accounted for nearly 40% of the nation's total work force in the same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picky, Picky 
</P>
<P>
Such financial independence in women has made it inevitable for them to become 
choosier about the men they choose if they do marry. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Altman Institute, a research branch of the match-making 
Altman Co., showed that 75% of the women surveyed said the men they would marry 
must earn more than $25,000 a year, a substantial income for a young Japanese 
man. About 91% said the man has to be a university graduate working as an 
engineer; 69% preferred public servants; 54% sought office workers. About 76% 
also said that the groom ought to be four to five years older than the bride. 
</P>
<P>
"Women ask for too much," complained Iyori, the student at Marriage Man 
Academy. "They won't accept you unless you qualify all their conditions, and 
their idea of a man's salary is too high." 
</P>
<P>
Though Higuchi agrees that single women tend to be a bit greedy, she said that 
men have much more to learn than women. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the basic form of a couple will be one where the wife and 
husband both maintain their independence, said Higuchi. 
</P>
<P>
To survive such relationships, "Men must learn more about the changes in women 
as well as in society," she said Higuchi. "In the old days there were stage 
settings that helped men take power over women. But we are now at an age when 
men must face women with their true ability."

3 OF O.C.'S 6 DRIVE-INS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR LAST PICTURE SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three of Orange County's six remaining drive-in theaters have closed, including 
the fabled one in Orange where televangelist Robert H. Schuller began preaching 
atop the refreshment stand, Pacific Theaters &amp; Drive-Ins announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller, now host of the weekly "Hour of Power" TV show from the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove, rented the theater for outdoor services in 1955, 
soon after arriving from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Orange Drive-In has featured Spanish-language films and 
Sunday swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based chain also closed theaters in La Habra and Buena Park on 
Monday. The La Habra theater has one screen, the Buena Park theater has three. 
Pacific closed a drive-in in Burbank the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but an employee 
who provides the chain's listings to The Times confirmed the Orange County 
closings. A small sign appeared at the Burbank theater. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific continues to operate two other drive-ins in Orange County, the Hi-Way 
39 in Westminster, with four screens, and the Anaheim, with three screens, 
along with about a dozen others in the Los Angeles area. Century Theatres, 
based in San Francisco, operates Orange County's only other drive-in, the 
Stadium in Anaheim, with six screens. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, the number of drive-ins in the county has dwindled. In 
1985, three drive-ins closed, including Pacific's Mission in San Juan 
Capistrano, which became the site of a shopping center. The Harbor in Santa 
Ana, another Spanish-language venue, closed several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, although the number of drive-ins in the country is down sharply from a 
high of 4,600 screens in 1955, the drive-in business has stabilized in recent 
years, according to Mary Ann Grasso, executive director of the National Assn. 
of Theater Owners. 
</P>
<P>
Grasso said this is especially true in Sun Belt states, where the climate 
permits year-round operations. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, 1989, there were 1,497 screens in the United States. The Fox 
Theater chain in Reading, Pa., opened a new drive-in this month, Grasso said.

HANDEL GETS CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH -- AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHIATRIST STUDIES HIS PAPERS, CONCLUDES COMPOSER WAS 'NORMALLY NEUROTIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that too much has been made of the theory that most creative people are 
crazy, a New York psychiatry professor examining the life and health of George 
Frideric Handel has taken issue with a widely accepted belief the composer was 
a manic depressive. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the conventional mental health wisdom about Handel is 
contained in an essay by Dr. William Frosch, of Cornell University Medical 
College in New York City. In sum, said Frosch, the belief that Handel had acute 
mental health problems is nothing more than "a bum rap." 
</P>
<P>
Frosch reached his own conclusions about Handel during a six-month sabbatical 
in London in 1986, during which he sought out the composer's own papers and 
other primary resource materials from his time. The Frosch essay is being 
published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Frosch is also an amateur oboist. He said he was drawn to the study because 
scholars have assumed that Handel, who suffered from paralysis and blindness in 
the months before he died in 1759, also had numerous "clear depressive 
episodes." 
</P>
<P>
Handel's mental health, so the speculation has it, influenced his music and led 
him to an asexual life obsessed with music. But, said Frosch, close examination 
does not support such a diagnosis. "I do not believe there are data to support 
any of these myths," Frosch concluded. "I believe Handel had a rich, normally 
neurotic personality. 
</P>
<P>
"He was enthusiastic, even demanding, in his art, but his commitment and focus 
were leavened by his wit, broadened by his other interests and by personal 
generosity and protected by . . . obsessive-compulsive defenses." 
</P>
<P>
Frosch said Handel was in good health until just a few months before his death, 
but his prior medical history included apparent paralysis of the right arm, 
from which Handel seemed to recover after visiting a health spa. 
</P>
<P>
But while Handel may have suffered from arthritis, Frosch said, another 
explanation may be that Handel is known to have had a taste for Port wine, 
which at that time contained high levels of lead. Because Handel would have 
been required to abstain while visiting the health spa, a cure would appear to 
have been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The composer also suffered from acute vision problems -- probably cataracts -- 
starting in about 1752 that eventually led to complete blindness. Primitive 
surgery was attempted at the time, without success. 
</P>
<P>
He had occasional loss of appetite and insomnia, but Frosch said these 
disorders seem to be part of a normal emotional response to deterioration of 
physical health and the impending end of life. "His mental disturbances seem 
clearly reactive and secondary," Frosch concluded. "I find no direct 
contemporary evidence of primary depression, mania or any other primary major 
mental illness." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Frosch said the significance of this finding may be 
that it scotches an assumption popular about artists and the arts -- that many 
creative people have an at best tenuous hold on sanity. 
</P>
<P>
Frosch said there clearly are creative people who suffer from mental disorders 
-- composer Robert Schumann and painter Vincent Van Gogh, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the whole idea of creativity being tied to madness has been a 
recurrent theme," Frosch said. "I think it is often just wrong and to think 
that one has to be mad in order to be creative, I think, sets people off on the 
wrong track, both in terms of evaluating what is creative and a creator -- and 
in setting standards for how people who think of themselves as creative should 
behave."

BALLET FOLKLORICO'S NEW PRODUCERS HAVE BIG IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a plum gig -- producing the first U.S. tour in a decade of the original 
Ballet Folklorico de Mexico -- as the latter-day Barnum and Bailey who've 
landed the job know. And have they got a show for you: It opens tonight in the 
Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Legendary impresario Sol Hurok guided Amalia Hernandez and her company here for 
20 years. When he died in 1979, Ballet Folklorico stopped touring the United 
States, although it continued to perform elsewhere around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Co-producers Adam Friedson of Los Angeles and Julio Solorzano of Mexico City 
came on board to handle the current tour after Hernandez "tested" them last 
year with the company's limited engagement in Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Now Friedson, a presenter with a long-term interest in U.S.-Latin America 
exchanges, and Solorzano, a singer-songwriter and entrepreneur whom Friedson 
describes as "the Sol Hurok of Mexico," have a four-year contract with 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Here are two guys trying to find out the right people to host or produce with 
us in all of these cities -- many of which I've never been to, much less has 
Julio been to -- that's the risky side," says the modest but jocular Friedson. 
</P>
<P>
"The secure side is we have the most important folkloric dance company in the 
hemisphere, one of the two greatest in the world, with the Moiseyev." 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Hernandez in 1952 and long an official cultural representative of 
the Mexican government, the 400-strong Ballet Folklorico now operates under the 
auspices of the National Institute of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The company has inspired countless clones, both here and in Mexico. At home it 
boasts a resident troupe -- directed by Hernandez's daughter Norma Lopez 
Hernandez -- and a school, in addition to the 65-member touring contingent. 
</P>
<P>
This year Friedson and Solorzano are taking the company to 33 Western cities 
plus Chicago in seven weeks. And they're doing it with only a partial 
sponsorship from Honda, counting on the box office to make up most of the $4 
million in costs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the odds are better than those they faced the first time out. "Last year 
we had no sponsorship at all," Friedson recalls. "I'd never done one 
performance of a ballet, let alone four performances at the Shrine Auditorium 
with 6,300 seats." 
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, they'd been promised $250,000 in sponsorship from 
Spanish-language media that fell through at the last minute. Three weeks before 
the show, the producers had no underwriting and $50,000 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
The Ballet Folklorico is "country, flag, mother and apple pie," Friedson says. 
"As Julio likes to say, this is the Virgin de Guadalupe, but even that wasn't 
going to fill the Shrine." 
</P>
<P>
"We just did everything we could think of and we had three full houses and one 
half house and it was a success. We had $300,000 in gross expenses for four 
shows, with a 10% profit." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the stakes are greater, people have cautioned the daring duo about the 
scale of their ambitions. "The only reason we've tried it is because we didn't 
know better," Friedson adds. 
</P>
<P>
They're taking it on partly because they feel the support is there: "We knew 
the marketplace has changed in the United States. There are many more Latins 
who're more successful economically." 
</P>
<P>
For Hernandez, it means the pleasure of returning to a country in which, she 
says, "things are easier." 
</P>
<P>
"We are well recognized here and the dancers love it because we are so close 
(to Mexico)." 
</P>
<P>
Both Hernandez and her producers hope to see the Ballet Folklorico become as 
well-known in the United States as it is in Mexico, especially as 1992 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"1992 is a very important year for Latin American culture, because it's the 
500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas," says Solorzano. "Also, 
it's the 40th anniversary of the Ballet Folklorico." 
</P>
<P>
They want to appeal to a "crossover" audience, not just those of Latino 
heritage, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexican art is perceived as interesting only for Mexicans or Mexican-Americans 
and this is something we have to fight," Solorzano explains. "You wouldn't 
think a Russian company would be appealing only for the Russian and Ukrainians 
of New York." 
</P>
<P>
Mogul-like as they may be, this is a team for whom the bottom line isn't the 
bottom line. As Friedson explains, "Julio and I both committed to cultural 
literacy. We're going to do a lot of things that are not about making a 
profit." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make available to underprivileged children their own culture, so we 
put together a free show for 3,000 Hispanic kids who are hosting black, Asian 
and Anglo children at the Shrine on Friday," Friedson says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to get kids from different cultures together than it is to get 
adults from different cultures together," Solorzano adds.

The Old Globe Theatre will present "Jake's Women," its second world premiere of 
a Neil Simon play in two years, March 8 to April 15. Ron Link, known in Los 
Angeles for his kinetic stagings of "Bouncers" and "Stand-Up Tragedy," will 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
The Simon play is one of six productions announced for the winter/spring season 
at the Old Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding "Jake's Women" on the main stage Jan. 11 to Feb. 18 will be Chekhov's 
"Uncle Vanya," directed by Jack O'Brien, the Old Globe's artistic director. 
Following "Jake's Women" will be the West Coast premiere of Lee Blessing's 
"Cobb," about baseball great Ty Cobb, tentatively slated for May 3 to June 10. 
A co-production with the Yale Repertory Theatre, "Cobb" will be directed by 
Yale's Lloyd Richards. 
</P>
<P>
The season at the 225-seat Cassius Carter Centre Stage will open Jan. 6 with 
Roberto M. Cossa's "The Granny," a black comedy about a family in depressed 
Argentina, playing through Feb. 18. It went through a workshop earlier this 
year in the Latino Play Discovery Series, a project of the Old Globe's Teatro 
Meta. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast premiere of Mark Lee's "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," about two 
arrogant journalists in an African region torn with violence, will be March 3 
to April 15 on the smaller stage. It will be followed by Lanie Robertson's 
"Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," April 28 to June 10. This show, about 
singer Billie Holiday, was seen in 1987 at the Hollywood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's "Jake's Women" continues the semi-autobiographical tradition of the 
playwright's "Chapter 2" and the trilogy of "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi 
Blues" and "Broadway Bound" with the story of a middle-aged writer and six of 
the most important women in his life -- his analyst, his sister, his daughter, 
his wife, his ex-wife and a friend. It was supposed to be Simon's first world 
premiere at the Old Globe last year, but when the show wasn't ready, Simon's 
farce "Rumors" was substituted. "Rumors" went from San Diego to Broadway.

JOKERS WILL MOVE INTO HYATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The "comedy boom" you often hear about refers primarily to the frenzied 
proliferation nationally of comedy clubs and stand-up comics, and it's 
reverberating in Orange County again with the opening this weekend of a new 
venue in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The club is Jokers, inside the Hyatt Regency Alicante, about a mile from 
Disneyland. That puts it just a stone's throw from Coconuts, the comedy 
nightspot that opened 16 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jokers and Coconuts are in hotels and offer shows Friday and Saturday 
nights. Otherwise, the two operations reflect pretty different approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Coconuts -- which, coincidentally, is changing its name to Shtick's on Oct. 1 
-- presents comics who generally haven't developed much name recognition or key 
credits. The plus side is a cover charge of $5, which means you can see a 
comedy show there for less than you often have to pay for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Coconuts doesn't offer dinner service, but appetizers and drinks are available 
before and during the show. Shows are at 8:30 and 10 p.m., enabling someone to 
catch either show without it becoming a particularly late evening. Jokers, on 
the other hand, plans to specialize in presenting so-called "high-end" 
entertainment -- that is, more established comedians with significant credits 
in film and television, often including "Late Night With David Letterman" and 
"The Tonight Show." Not surprisingly, then, the cover charge will be higher -- 
$10 or more, depending on the the headliner. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner will be served in a restaurant next to the showroom before the 
performance, with those eating dinner receiving priority seating for the first 
show; appetizers and drinks will be available during the show. Jokers has 
arranged for the Hyatt to provide free shuttle service to other nearby hotels. 
The shows will be at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jokers won't celebrate its official grand opening until the weekend of 
Oct. 6 -- with headliner Dave Coulier, a 12-year stand-up veteran who has 
appeared on "The Tonight Show" and stars on the hit ABC sitcom "Full House" -- 
this weekend's "preview nights" feature a strong bill, including Mark Schiff 
and Peter Pitofsky. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on what he's wearing, Schiff often looks like a cross between Harpo 
and Chico Marx and is sometimes as funny as Groucho. Not that he's as acerbic. 
Rather, Schiff -- who boasts all the top credits -- deals primarily in 
universal, everyday topics, with a big chunk devoted to family life. 
</P>
<P>
Pitofsky is a highly unusual physical comic who does amazing things with his 
body. And with his face: His impression of Dizzy Gillespie snoring is classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schiff and Peter Pitofsky perform Friday and Saturday at 9:30 and 11:30 
p.m. at Jokers in the Hyatt Regency Alicante, 100 Plaza Alicante, Garden Grove. 
Tickets: $10. Information: (714) 971-3000.

BUILDING DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
TEEN-AGERS LEND HELPING HAND SO THE NEEDY CAN OWN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NEEDHAM and HENRY DIROCCO, Needham is a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunlight flooded the skeletal frame of the house as the four Orange County 
teen-agers a thousand miles from home tried desperately not to drop the 
six-foot-long piece of drywall they were holding above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, another youth manhandled a beam into place to prop up the drywall. But 
then came the to-and-froing, jostling the material this way and that before 
finally getting it in place, another part of what would eventually be a 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Muscles aching, faces bathed in sweat, it was time for another chore. How about 
jumping into the waist-high ditch outside the house and helping to shovel out 
some more dirt? Grabbing shovels, off they went, disappearing one by one into 
the ditch. 
</P>
<P>
For some folks summer vacation meant palm trees, exotic shores and relaxing 
days in a beach chair with a good book. But for eight teen-age volunteers from 
the First Christian Church of Orange, it meant a journey north to build houses 
for people who otherwise couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
The students, all in high school or just graduated, belong to the church's 
Christian Youth Fellowship. Each summer the group picks a different project and 
hits the road. One year, they helped build a house in Yuma; another time they 
rehabilitated buildings on an Indian reservation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This year the goal was housing again, and the site was Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The eight teen-agers and four adults stayed overnight in Disciples of Christ 
churches en route to Seattle, pitching sleeping bags on basement floors from 
Bakersfield to Grants Pass, Ore. Once settled in the Seattle area, the group 
spent six days helping to build three houses as volunteers for a program known 
as Habitat for Humanity International. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is a nonprofit, ecumenical housing project that uses donations 
and volunteer workers to build affordable housing for needy families. Since its 
founding in 1976, Habitat has built more than 5,000 homes worldwide. Its most 
prominent member has been former President Jimmy Carter, a board member who 
leads work camps each year in poverty-stricken neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a Habitat affiliate in Orange County, it is working out final 
details of its initial construction projects and has not yet started building 
or rehabilitating structures, according to Ken Karlstead, chairman of the board 
of directors of the local affiliate. But for the teen-agers who went to 
Seattle, traveling out of the Southern California area was an important part of 
the summer experience, said Mike Post, a recent graduate of Orange High School 
who is now a freshman at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
"You leave all of your troubles and worries behind you," said Post, who, unlike 
most of the students, had been on these volunteer expeditions before. "When you 
are away from home . . . you are down to the basics. You are open to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Prenzlow, a senior at El Modena High School in Orange who has a flair for 
construction and woodworking and became an informal tutor to the other 
volunteers, said: "You are a family for 13 days. You are forced to deal with 
all of the negative and positive issues on the trip, and you grow. It's a place 
where you can be yourself and also cut loose." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of the adults, the students themselves made many of the 
decisions on who would do what jobs and which sights would be seen during their 
time off. The teen-agers also had a major voice in choosing the Seattle site, 
figuring the temperate weather would mean they could get more work done than in 
other possible locations such as Bakersfield or Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have a hand in the decision-making for the trip, and parents and 
students ultimately make the final choice (together)," said Dan Oliver, 
associate pastor at First Christian Church and the staff director for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
For Prenzlow, a barrel-chested youth with close-cropped hair, the most 
rewarding aspect of the trip was helping others. "You need the work part to 
have a real balance," he said, explaining why the Christian Youth Fellowship 
group chooses service projects over frolic for summer trips. "We can all do 
something. We all have gifts we can give. You can always use your talents for 
something helpful. The trip wouldn't be the same without the work part. We were 
just one small group. If there were lots of small groups, we could accomplish a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said the trip gave the youths a firsthand look at how the other half 
lives, "finding out people's needs in the world other than just reading about 
it or hearing others speak about it. It was a way to meet people and work with 
them as a community and get some good done," as well as to provide the church 
group "with some real tangible types of experience," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stone, 35, was overjoyed to see the Orange County group arrive. Stone acted 
essentially as a construction foreman for two of the houses the volunteers 
helped build. 
</P>
<P>
"Small groups are like pennies on the dollar -- they all add up. They all 
count," he said. "Habitat is made up of volunteers, and you need all the 
volunteers you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Stone, a single parent with five children, was himself a recipient of a Habitat 
home, moving into the first completed project of the Seattle chapter in 1985. 
He has strong memories of the work on his own home. "The house has more value 
to it than just monetary; it means so much more. You can remember building each 
room. I live there, and I hope to die there. It's more than just a house." 
</P>
<P>
Each recipient of a Habitat home is required to help build it, usually 
supplying 1,000 hours of "sweat equity." The new owners wind up getting 
involved in all aspects of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Hall, one of the volunteers from Orange County, said she was happy to 
give the Seattle residents "the chance to have a house like I've always had, to 
give them a better start, not having to pay such high rents," so they could 
have enough money to "make sure they each get enough to eat each night." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners-to-be "were definitely a lot poorer" than her Orange County 
friends and acquaintances, she said, but they impressed her with their hard 
work. "I feel that they really deserved the houses, wanting them so bad, 
working on them, having their friends and family work on them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure what kind of work I'd be doing. Working for a family you don't 
know, in a place you don't know -- it's kind of an unsure feeling," said Hall, 
a slender, sandy-haired sophomore at Villa Park High School in Orange. She 
ended up doing a number of tasks, from hanging drywall to digging drainage 
trenches and installing shower stalls. "Anyone who gets the chance should work 
for Habitat for Humanity. The 'thank yous' from somebody you are working for, 
working side by side, that's really something special." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Pippen, a single mother of an adolescent daughter and a son not yet in 
his teens, marveled that the volunteers would come from so far away to help 
build the house where her family will live. Pippen uses a cane because of a leg 
problem. Before getting help from the Habitat volunteers, she was trying to dig 
ditches around her house with one hand while keeping the other firmly on the 
cane. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous volunteers come by on weekends to help with construction, but during 
the week there were far fewer, so the California volunteers were especially 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said the working experience was the main reason for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most significant ministry to young people that I know," Oliver 
said. "To go and work with peers and adults, to work for someone else, is one 
of the most important things you can do. We were actually working with people 
who will be living in the homes. We could see who we were helping; it became 
really personal. A lot of the kids learned a new skill too, and it became fun." 
</P>
<P>
At one site where the volunteers worked, the house was just about done, except 
for details such as painting, spackling and sanding some rooms, and installing 
electrical fixtures. When the teen-agers left, the building was just a 
hairbreadth away from being ready for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
More needed to be done at the site supervised by Stone, where a pair of 
two-story houses -- one of which will be occupied by the Pippen family -- 
needed drywall, sewage and drainage lines, outlets installed, walls spackled. 
The volunteers also joined forces to roll piles of rocks into place to serve as 
impromptu retaining walls while final construction was done. 
</P>
<P>
Post said the trip was "a great learning experience. It made you think." In 
affluent Orange County, "we take a lot for granted," he added. For the people 
in Seattle, the homes are "all they have," he said. "It makes you feel good to 
be a part of that, to help them get re-established in their life." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the group was up at 6:30 a.m. at the church where they stayed and on 
the job site by 8 a.m. After digging, putting up drywall, installing electrical 
outlets and the other jobs, they knocked off at 4 p.m. or so. Evenings included 
trips to Seattle tourist sites such as the Space Needle and, on one evening, a 
baseball game at the Kingdome, where the Seattle Mariners beat Anaheim's own 
California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Nights also included discussions of the jobs just done and those ahead, plus 
what Oliver called "a centering time, a faith exploration time." 
</P>
<P>
And, toward the end, there was the "drywall mud fight" -- just good, 
not-so-clean fun, said Oliver, who joked, "They found out the exact texture of 
drywall mud, which is important to know in life." 
</P>
<P>
Post said the experience was "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"The families we worked with are real nice, real dedicated, willing to help to 
better themselves. There's a real tight community among the people working at 
Habitat."

FAMILY LIFE: GETTING IN HOT WATER FOR NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Twain once said that humans were the only animals to blush, mainly because 
they were the only ones who had any reason to. 
</P>
<P>
He also told a wonderful story about being punished by his mother (she kept a 
thimble on her middle finger for thumping heads) for something he hadn't done. 
</P>
<P>
Both stories came to mind this past weekend when I did the former because I 
almost committed the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Walking stocking-feet through the living room, I discovered a large wet spot on 
the carpet in front of the television -- in the exact spot where my younger son 
often sprawls. I asked him if he had spilled something. He insisted that he had 
not, so I asked my older son, who denied even being in the room for at least 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," I pointed out with clear logic and fine sarcasm, "water just doesn't 
appear in the living room. It doesn't rain indoors, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously someone was not telling the truth, and it just as obviously had to be 
one of them, considering that only the three of us live there and I certainly 
hadn't spilled anything (for one thing, I wouldn't have left any evidence). 
</P>
<P>
So it was time for one of those talks about the importance of truth, no matter 
how difficult to tell, being better than a vile lie, blah, blah, blah, of never 
having to be afraid of telling your father anything, blah, blah, blah. You know 
the talk -- it's the one where their eyes roll back into their heads at about 
the second blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
Lecture completed, I made a magnanimous gesture. We'll all clean it up and the 
incident will be forever forgotten, but in the future, blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that all the sponges and towels in the house (and all the 
king's horses and all the king's men, too, for that matter) couldn't soak up 
the water. The spot was growing. 
</P>
<P>
I was wrong. Water can just appear in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a plumber and his miniature jackhammer, we were able to find a 
broken hot water pipe under the concrete (which, of course, is under the 
carpet, under the mat, under the wood) that had probably been leaking for a 
month or two. 
</P>
<P>
So it was my turn for a lecture, which I hope I accepted a little more 
graciously than certain unnamed people receive mine. 
</P>
<P>
I guess I'm just lucky they don't own thimbles. 
</P>
<P>
There's no indignation that matches that which comes from being falsely accused 
(except, of course, that which comes from being justly accused). 
</P>
<P>
Like Twain, I can remember being wrongfully indicted by my mother. The exact 
incident eludes me, but the indignation remains. Twain's mother's response was 
to tell him to consider the thump on the head punishment for something he'd 
gotten away with. 
</P>
<P>
My mother just changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
At least I had the sense to apologize, but I often wonder whether we're not all 
doomed to repeat dumb things our parents did or said to us. 
</P>
<P>
How often have you caught yourself telling your child something you had 
considered absolutely ridiculous when your parents said it to you years before? 
</P>
<P>
For example, my rather strict father insisted that my brother, sister and I be 
in bed with the lights out at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to bed and go to sleep," he would say, as if without the complete 
instructions we would go to bed and play baseball or field hockey. Then, if he 
heard any noise, he would pop in and say, "I told you to go to sleep!" 
</P>
<P>
My brother and I would spend another half hour very quietly discussing the 
silliness of ordering someone to go to sleep as if it were like flipping a 
light switch on and off. 
</P>
<P>
We also swore that if we ever had children, we'd never say something as dumb as 
that to them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The evening after the pond-in-the-living-room incident, I was helping my 
younger son prepare for an outing scheduled the next morning. We agreed he 
should get to bed early. 
</P>
<P>
About 9 he was still up fooling around with something, and I suggested he'd 
best be getting to bed -- now! 
</P>
<P>
Another hour passed and I noticed the light still on in his room. I popped in, 
turned it off and sternly said, "I told you to go to sleep!" 
</P>
<P>
Making Allowances 
</P>
<P>
Do you give your children an allowance? If so, how much do they get and on what 
is the rate based? 
</P>
<P>
Burning the Midnight Toil 
</P>
<P>
If you're one of the millions of Americans -- from nurses to police officers to 
convenience store clerks -- who work through the night, we'd like to hear from 
you. Do abnormal hours preclude normal family relationships? Tell us how you 
cope. 
</P>
<P>
Spare the Rod 
</P>
<P>
How do you punish your children -- by spanking them or by restricting their 
activities? Or do you have some other method? We'd like to know.

ANN CONWAY: THEY ALL GET A KICK OUT OF MITZI AT 'ANYTHING GOES' BASH

"I get no kick from champagne, mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all, so tell 
me why should it be true, that I get a kick out of you?" -- Cole Porter 
</P>
<P>
Guests got a kick from champagne, mere alcohol, and Mitzi Gaynor on Tuesday 
after she opened in "Anything Goes" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
So much of a kick that the fiftysomething Gaynor got her second standing 
ovation of the evening when she swept into Scott's Seafood Bar &amp; Grill on 
the arm of Jack Bean, her hubby of thirtysomething years. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitzi, we love you!" guests squealed, trying to applaud and raise their 
glasses at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to her energy-packed performance? "I have nooooooo idea!" she 
chirped, smiling as she settled down with buddies Jess Marlow and Donald 
O'Connor for a midnight supper. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mamakos knew. "She simply doesn't age," said Mamakos, her publicist for 20 
years. "She takes care of herself -- jogs every day, works out every day, takes 
voice lessons, does gymnastics. Her energy is inborn!" 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's performance, at the Center through Sept. 17, kicked off the 
new, national touring production of Cole Porter's 1934 classic which features 
ditties such as "You're the Top" and "I Get a Kick Out of You." 
</P>
<P>
"Donald O'Connor and I were saying that it's downright embarrassing to remember 
all of the lyrics so well," said KNBC newsman Marlow. 
</P>
<P>
"And it hit me how contemporary that line is about cocaine ('some get their 
kicks from cocaine' from 'I Get a Kick Out of You') . . . how tragically 
contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
Marlow and wife came from Los Angeles to see the show. "We wouldn't miss it," 
Marlow said. "We've known Mitzi and Jack for years. "There's an electricity 
about her. She believes you have to take care of yourself, then you do what you 
want. And she has a strong sense of determination to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor proclaimed the production "rich." 
</P>
<P>
"Mitzi was wonderful. The costumes were wonderful." (To say the least. You 
could've heard a diamond pin drop when Gaynor wowed the dressed-to-kill theater 
crowd in ensemble after glitzy, figure-hugging, ensemble.) 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor will appear in Orange County on Oct. 14 when he does a benefit for the 
American Cinema Awards Foundation at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided what I'll sing yet, " he said, surveying a buffet table 
arrayed with seafood-stuffed pasta, blackened snapper medallions, calamari 
salad, fried oysters and desserts. "But there's a good chance I'll do 'Moses 
Supposes' from 'Singing in the Rain.' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's formula for career longevity? "You have to serve your apprenticeship 
well," he said with a serious tone. "Then, you continue to use your God-given 
talent and hope your audience doesn't get tired of you."

Sunday in the Park with Jack: Susie Peltason wasn't about to pick up a mallet 
at the "Croquet on the Green" party staged by the UC Irvine Chancellor's Club. 
"The truth is, I have so many ways to make a fool of myself, I don't need 
another one," she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
So UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason's good-natured wife, dressed in the 
invitation-prescribed all-white attire, sat with pals under the towering trees 
that shade Aldrich Park on the campus and talked. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of party. If you were handy with a mallet, you could haul 
yourself out on a manicured green and whack a wooden ball to your heart's 
content. If not -- if supping and sipping were more your style -- there was 
English fare to choose from (watercress sandwiches, for example, and fresh 
strawberry trifle -- served up under snow-white pavilions). And Pimm's cups 
were presented the classic way, with a splash of soda and a wedge of crisp 
cucumber. 
</P>
<P>
The man for whom the party was named managed to do it all. "This is a fun day," 
said Peltason, dapper in his "all whites." 
</P>
<P>
"People of all ages can do well at this game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Tenney, winner of the highest score with her partner, Bill 
Schmidtendorf, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to have any skill," said the UCI alum, laughing. "It's all a 
matter of luck!" 
</P>
<P>
Tenney loved the annual affair, she said, "because I get to dress up, and I 
don't have to sweat a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Croquet on the Green" was instituted two years ago to bring something 
traditional to the campus, said Cindy Kramarz, director of the Chancellor's 
Club. "We wanted to use the park, and we wanted to do something that had a 
different twist." 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the club, Kramarz said, is to raise $425,000 in the coming year for 
undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships and faculty research projects. 
</P>
<P>
There are two levels of giving in the Chancellor's Club. Regular members donate 
$1,250 per year. Members of the Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. Society donate $2,500 
annually.

CORONA DEL MAR SANDCASTLE CONTEST PUTS PROFESSIONAL CONCEPTS, SANDBOX 
EXPERIENCE TO A TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
John Di Lauro knelt on the beach and, ever so gently, carved at the masterpiece 
before him, a wondrous castle of sweeping curves, finely shaped stairs, windows 
and spires. With the stainless steel blade of his knife, he slowly widened the 
opening beneath an arch of sand. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see how far we can go." 
</P>
<P>
Six inches, seven, eight, nine -- the span slowly grew longer, improbably wide. 
Then in a sudden WHUMPF, the arch -- and half of Di Lauro's castle -- collapsed 
on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we know." 
</P>
<P>
Di Lauro, 27, an architect with Klages, Carter, Vale &amp; Partners of Costa 
Mesa, makes a living pushing materials to the limits of their strength. But on 
the beach at Corona del Mar on Sunday, he and about 40 others from his 
profession found themselves on unfirm ground. 
</P>
<P>
Representing more than a dozen Orange County architectural firms, they came to 
learn how to build sandcastles. Not the dribble castles of childhood, but 
spectacular structures daring, clever, and intricate enough to win the 1989 
Invitational Sandcastle Competition to be held on the beach Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Orange County chapter of the American Institute of Architects, 
the contest will be the first in the county to feature teams led exclusively by 
professional architects. The Sunday workshop was one of two held this summer to 
school contestants in the fundamentals of sandcastle construction. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lessons involved a lot of sophisticated architectural concepts: 
water-to-sand ratio, degree of compaction, adherence. 
</P>
<P>
Others were more basic. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me give you some tips on how to shovel," said Kent Trollen, one of the 
workshop organizers, to a crowd of eager students who just had besmirched their 
fellows in a cross-fire of heaved sand. 
</P>
<P>
Trollen, a Newport Beach architect and professional sandcastle builder, will be 
the "beach master" for the Oct. 1 contest, making sure that about 30 teams 
along a quarter-mile of beach comply with the rules and spirit of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The contest rules are simple. Only sand and water -- no bonding agents -- can 
be used. Only 12 people can be in a team's 20-foot-by-20-foot building site at 
a time. Others can be enlisted, however, to carry buckets of ocean water to the 
building site. Hundreds of buckets are needed to create a large structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one group in a workshop bring a gasoline-powered water pump and a hose 
so they wouldn't have to carry water," Trollen said. The contest rules bar any 
use of gasoline or electrical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of Sunday's workshop focused on how to get the sand into a form 
that can be carved or shaped. 
</P>
<P>
"The sand here isn't the best," Trollen said. "It has larger grains that don't 
adhere as well as sand at other beaches, like Seal Beach. That makes it harder 
to do vertical fades and push-throughs. That's why it's important to make sure 
you've got the right amount of water and pack it down right." 
</P>
<P>
To build taller structures, the contestants learned how to stack a series of 
smaller molds, one atop another like the terraced layers of a wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Poland, a Newport Beach architect and a contest organizer, told a group of 
neophyte builders that organization and planning are the keys to success. 
</P>
<P>
"You can build something 16 feet high, but you've got to think out the order of 
your work. You've got to start work from the top down, otherwise you won't be 
able to reach it later. And everybody has got to work in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, four people, each using a shovel as lever, tried to pry a 30-gallon 
trash can mold off the sand packed inside. At first, it began to move up and 
away from the sand. But one of the four pushed too hard. The form tilted and 
sand inside spilled out in a heap. 
</P>
<P>
Once the builders had formed their blocks of sand, they began to shape their 
creations with hands, cement trowels and thin-bladed palette knives. The 
carvers quickly divided into two types: sculptors and scratchers, the latter by 
far the larger group. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the would-be builders made bold, aggressive slashes in their sand 
blocks, hewing quickly to some imagined shape. Most of the rest picked and 
nicked gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the contestants are architects or engineers and familiar with a 
wide range of materials, sand is a mystery to most of them, said contest 
organizer Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"In their minds, sand is such a fragile thing. That's what we're trying to show 
them in the workshop: They have to push the sand to the point that it fails, so 
they know how far they can go in their designs." 
</P>
<P>
Poland, a professional sandcastle builder, knows how far sand can be pushed. He 
and colleague Trollen were part of the team that built a 53-foot, 3-inch 
sandcastle in Florida three years ago. "It's in the Guiness Book of Records," 
Poland said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
As the workshop progressed and team members gained experience in the do's and 
don'ts of sand building, they began to consider possible designs for their 
contest entries. 
</P>
<P>
One team, a group of six people hastily assembled last week by architect Di 
Lauro, sat huddled in a circle on the beach, sketching ideas in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what we'll build. Could be a building, but maybe not. Could 
resemble a building, but then again, maybe not. Toughest part, though, will be 
organizing these people," he said, to good-natured groans from the group. 
</P>
<P>
The team considered humorous designs: a fat man slouched on a couch watching TV 
or fish sunbathing on a beach while humans swam in the water. 
</P>
<P>
They reached no consensus and agreed to fax designs among the five 
architectural offices they represent during the weeks before the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the indecision, team member Norman Lei, 26, an architect with the firm 
of Pekarek and Crandall in Laguna Beach, overflowed with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win this. I can say that with certainty. We'll have a fabulous 
top-secret design. And I'll go on to become a professional sandcastle builder 
and make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
And what will his job be on the winning team? 
</P>
<P>
"Shoveling, probably."

ASK THE VET: POSSIBLE PARASITIC INFECTION NEEDS CARE SOON

Q: I have a 12-week-old female mixed breed that has been having a lot of 
diarrhea. Is it possible for her to have worms even though I don't see any 
worms in her stools? She goes outside most of the time and, although her stool 
is runny, she doesn't seem to be sick. 
</P>
<P>
She eats very well and is active most of the time, although she doesn't seem to 
be gaining a lot of weight for what she eats. I once gave her some worm 
capsules that I bought at the store but her stools haven't changed very much. 
</P>
<P>
I have also given her some Pepto Bismol, which does seem to help at times. 
Should I give her more of the worming capsules? Is there anything that I can 
add to her food that will help her get better? 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Whitley, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: chronic diarrhea or very soft stools in a puppy could definitely signal a 
parasitic infection that should be treated as soon as possible. Other possible 
problems could be improper diet, such as cow's milk, or frequent changing of 
foods to which a pup's digestive system must adapt. 
</P>
<P>
Getting into the trash, eating fatty table scraps, chewing and eating plants, 
or swallowing various foreign materials may all cause severe digestive upsets 
that result in diarrhea. There are also very serious viral and bacterial 
infections that can occur and even become life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
Except for tapeworms, looking at a puppy's stools for worms is not an accurate 
way to diagnose a parasitic infection. You should have your puppy examined by 
your veterinarian and be sure to bring a fresh stool sample so that it may be 
examined in the lab for the eggs of any possible worms. Most worms or 
intestinal parasites shed their microscopic-size eggs in the stools. 
</P>
<P>
There are also single-celled organisms that are not worms that can cause 
diarrhea by destroying the lining of the intestines and preventing the 
absorption of nutrients. A microscopic examination of the feces will show the 
cysts of these organisms. Generally, the tapeworm is the only one of the common 
worms that infect cats and dogs that is diagnosed by seeing the individual 
segments being passed with the stools or attached to the hair coat. 
</P>
<P>
Once your veterinarian has made a diagnosis, the proper medication can be 
administered. Not all over-the-counter medications are effective and could even 
be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Whenever I take my Airedale for a walk or a run, he always stops to urinate 
on the bushes or grass. He will do this a dozen times or so, making it 
difficult to keep running with him on a leash. Is there anything I can do to 
prevent this? Is there a possibly of a bladder infection? Otherwise, he is a 
lot of fun to take places and always seems to attract attention wherever he 
goes. I hate to leave him at home since he seems to enjoy the exercise with me. 
</P>
<P>
P. Wiswell, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A: All the frequent stops and urinating are your pet's means of letting other 
dogs know that he has been there or is an effort to cover up some other dog's 
scent that has been left behind. It is natural behavior for male dogs and can 
be very difficult to break. It would be best to keep him on a short (6-foot) 
leash and talk to him when he starts to slow down or drift toward an object. A 
gentle tug of the leash and a sharp "No" will often keep him on the path and 
moving. Being alert and patient will help train him to sticking with you.

JURY FINDS 2 GUILTY IN ABORTION PROTEST; JAIL TERM AN OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two anti-abortion activists described by prosecutors as leaders in two April 
clinic blockades in San Diego were found guilty Wednesday of conspiring to 
organize the protests and seven other misdemeanor criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Municipal Court jury convicted Constance V. Youngkin, 41, of San 
Diego, and Frank B. Smith, 56, of Oceanside, in connection with the April 8 and 
April 29 demonstrations. They were the first among seven activists, all facing 
conspiracy charges, whom prosecutors had alleged in court papers "assumed 
active leadership roles" in the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Youngkin and Smith remained free on their own recognizance, pending sentencing, 
which San Diego Municipal Court Judge John M. Thompson set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentencing Options 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said Youngkin and Smith should be ready Friday to indicate which of 
three sentencing options each preferred -- a 45-day jail term, 60 days of 
public-service work such as highway trash detail or probation, likely for three 
years, a condition of which would be to avoid other anti-abortion protests. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a pastor, said he wanted to write about anti-abortion activities, "so 
I'm going to sharpen my pencils and go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Greg Anthony of Los Angeles, said, "It's his decision. I can't 
make it for him." 
</P>
<P>
Youngkin did not discuss her sentencing options. "I have one comment," she 
said. "If it's criminal to protect women from being exploited and to rescue 
babies from death, then I am a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Youngkin also faces a contempt hearing Friday stemming from a speech when the 
trial opened about topics Thompson had barred, including allegations of 
excessive police force during arrests at the demonstrations and the necessity 
of the protests to save babies, said Peter Hughes, the deputy city attorney who 
prosecuted both cases. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Youngkin and Smith of conspiring to organize, and aiding and 
abetting, the April 8 San Diego protest. It also found them guilty, in 
connection with both the April 8 and 29 demonstrations, of trespassing, failing 
to disperse and disobeying a court order. 
</P>
<P>
That order was a statewide injunction issued in March by U.S. District Judge A. 
Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles. It barred the activists, many affiliated with 
the group Operation Rescue, from blockading clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the case began Aug. 24. The lawyers presented their closing 
arguments Monday, and the jury got the case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sending a Message 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said he would ask Thompson to impose "substantial" jail time for both 
Youngkin and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew about the federal injunction. That didn't stop them," he said. "They 
were arrested on the 8th. That didn't slow them down. They were arrested on the 
29th. That didn't stop them. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the only way to send a message is some custody." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' supervisor, James M. Bishop, head deputy city attorney, said the 
verdict was not surprising. "We expected this all along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was expected to boost the morale of prosecutors, who, beginning 
Sept. 25, will try four more of the seven alleged leaders, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Those four are Dean Mesa, 30, of Vista; Joseph L. Foreman, 34, of Long Beach; 
Terry Macrae, 32, of Santee and Chet E. Gallagher, 39, of Las Vegas, Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 134 anti-abortion activists arrested at the protests April 8 and 29 and 
at another demonstration June 10 face misdemeanor charges, prosecutors have 
said. The Youngkin and Smith case was the first in what Thompson said at 
hearings in August will be a series of trials that will run one after another 
and probably will last a year. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, eight protesters faced conspiracy charges. William R. Lehman, 29, 
of Vista, who disavowed any affiliation with Operation Rescue, pleaded no 
contest Aug. 24 in San Diego Municipal Court to violating the Tashima order. In 
exchange, the city attorney's office dropped the conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspended Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Gale E. Kaneshiro imposed a suspended 90-day jail sentence, put 
Lehman on three years' probation and ordered him not to take part in other 
blockades. Lehman also was ordered to complete 180 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, Youngkin and Foreman were among 12 activists Tashima held in contempt 
Aug. 29 for violating the statewide injunction, in part from the April 8 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima levied $10,000 fines against each of the activists but suspended them, 
saying they will be reimposed if the activists again violate court orders 
preventing clinic blockades. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the activists to pay various amounts in attorneys' fees 
to the American Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers for costs incurred in 
bringing the contempt action on behalf of groups such as Planned Parenthood of 
San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Youngkin to pay $12,000 in attorneys' fees to the San Diego 
chapter of the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was not involved in Tashima's Aug. 29 ruling.

ASSEMBLY PRESSES BUSH FOR MORE DRUG-WAR AID; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT URGED TO DESIGNATE S.D., L.A. HIGH-INTENSITY TRAFFICKING AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's $8-billion war on drugs may turn up the heat on the Colombian 
cocaine cartel, but it doesn't go far enough to stem the flow of narcotics 
through the border via San Diego to Los Angeles, state lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
To make the point, the state Assembly on Wednesday unanimously approved 
language calling on Bush to officially designate the gang-torn neighborhoods of 
Los Angeles and the porous international border of San Diego and Imperial 
counties "high-intensity drug-trafficking areas." 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, Bush and his federal drug czar can invoke that 
designation in order to send more federal enforcement money and manpower to 
places like Southern California, the port of entry for an estimated 50% of the 
country's cocaine and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But so far Bush has declined to use the drug-zone designation at all, and 
indications are that he won't do so until at least February -- a delay that has 
baffled and angered California politicians in Washington and in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilson Complained About Lapse 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) complained about the lapse in a letter to 
Bush last month, referring to his tenure as San Diego's mayor to underscore the 
drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, when Mayor of the largest city on our border with Mexico, I 
personally witnessed and experienced the frustration of local communities and 
local officials facing a growing drug problem," Wilson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Now representing the entire State of California, I have seen the effects of 
the drug epidemic statewide and along the Southwest border. . . . While federal 
agencies have helped, they are grossly understaffed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the cause of the high-intensity drug zones has been taken up by state Sen. 
John Seymour (R-Anaheim), assisted by Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon). 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he is worried about the remote possibility that Southern 
California could be overlooked altogether when the designations are expected to 
be announced early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Los Angeles and the Mexican border area are included, he said it could 
take until 1991 before the federal government cuts loose the extra tens of 
millions of dollars needed to step up the fight against drugs on the domestic 
front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Want Any Foot-Dragging' 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want any foot-dragging on it, and I want to make sure that Los 
Angeles and the southern border area, including San Diego, is certainly 
designated," said Seymour, who served as a state co-chairman in Bush's election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Seymour decided to draft a direct appeal to Bush and have it inserted 
into one of his existing anti-drug Senate bills, which was up for consideration 
in the Assembly this week. Bentley offered the amendments on behalf of Seymour, 
and the Assembly approved the bill Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida was considered the gateway of the major drug imports until the federal 
government moved recently to close that down," Bentley said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the drug-importing trade has "shifted" to the less-prepared Southwestern 
border, Bentley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's appropriate to get the federal government to come and assist us 
the way it did . . . in Florida," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seymour amendment includes a litany of statistics to prove how drugs are 
becoming the scourge of San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It says that, in San Diego, the number of young people arrested on drug-related 
charges increased from 252 in 1980 to 410 in 1987. In the first six months of 
1988 alone, the number of narcotics-related homicides stood at 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PCP Centers 
</P>
<P>
The Seymour language also mentions that San Diego and Southern California are 
centers for the manufacture of PCP. 
</P>
<P>
According to the amendment, the amount of drugs seized between 1976 and 1986 in 
Los Angeles skyrocketed 19,500%, while the number of cocaine-related deaths has 
increased more than 200% since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour also cites the rising power of Los Angeles' youth gangs as an indicator 
of the increased flow of drugs through the country's second largest city. There 
are 250 Los Angeles gangs, boasting a collective membership of more than 
30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as the elaborate and violent activities of Colombia's drug cartels reach 
into communities throughout the United States, Los Angeles' Blood and Crips 
drug gangs have expanded operations into more than 50 cities nationwide, in 
effect, constituting the wholesale and retail distributors for the cocaine of 
Colombia's drug lords," says the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The new language now goes to the Senate for concurrence and, if passed, will go 
to Gov. George Deukmejian.

SCRIPPS OVER LAST HURDLE IN QUEST FOR NEW AQUARIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, they've been packing them in like sardines at the aquarium at UCSD's 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the aging facility that officials have 
long acknowledged has simply outlived its usefulness as a public attraction. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, for example, so many people jam into the 38-year-old building, 
badly deteriorating from the ever-present salt water in the coastal mist, that 
a waiting line often snakes out onto the adjacent aquarium grounds. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, aquarium officials realized a 20-year-old dream when the California 
Coastal Commission unanimously approved construction of a new $10-million 
aquarium and museum within view of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the La Jolla facility developed a problem unique for an 
aquarium -- too many schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets pretty bad, especially in the summer," said Tom Collins, associate 
director for administration at Scripps Institution. "We try to schedule all the 
school-age tour groups during the week. But, if something goes wrong, they all 
show up on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never happened to me, but I imagine that some weekend guests have 
literally pulled their hair out at the commotion." 
</P>
<P>
That is, if they could find a parking spot. The standing joke around the 
aquarium is that the place accommodates 370,000 visitors a year with about nine 
parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"On weekdays, there were only nine spots outside the building that were 
available to the public," said Donald Wilkie, director of the aquarium which 
perches on a scenic hillside along La Jolla Shores Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the parking is in a remote location, so people have to walk a 
quarter-mile uphill after their visit. It was a hardship for older people and 
families." 
</P>
<P>
The new Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum will feature 34,600 square feet of 
display area -- more than twice that of the existing 12,500-square-foot Scripps 
Aquarium -- and include classrooms, offices, even a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
And, as if aquarium officials needed a hook, the facility will also include an 
5,000 square feet more of displays on its grounds, including a new outdoor tide 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the new aquarium, scheduled to open in the fall of 1991, the museum 
portion will be four times as big as its predecessor. The aquarium will also 
intrigue visitors with 40 viewing tanks, almost twice as many as the existing 
22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Window on 70,000-Gallon Tank of Sea Life 
</P>
<P>
It will also feature a new, 70,000-gallon tank that, with its 12- by 20-foot 
viewing window, will provide the largest unobstructed viewing window in the 
aquarium field, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It will provide an unprecedented look into the tank within," said Wilkie, "an 
opportunity to view the sport fish we'll have on display, the yellowtail jack 
and sea basses -- larger variations of those species that the old tanks were 
just too small to hold." 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps just as important, a 250-space parking lot will adjoin the new 
aquarium, which will be built across the street from the old one, on a wooded 
knoll on the east side of La Jolla Shores Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The new site will provide a view of the ocean and beach, Scripps buildings and 
pier, La Jolla and La Jolla Cove, and, on a clear day, San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
"The view will be utterly fantastic," Wilkie said. "You couldn't afford to buy 
that lot with all the money in the world." 
</P>
<P>
For the public, however, the new aquarium may demand a price. Officials now ask 
adults for a $3 donation at the existing facility. They are considering 
requiring a formal $5 admission fee at the new structure. 
</P>
<P>
Like many associated with the aquarium, Wilkins could not hide his enthusiasm 
Wednesday over the go-ahead for the new aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once in a lifetime event, the culmination of a 20-year dream for many 
people associated with this aquarium," said Wilkie, who has been aquarium 
director for more than 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When they finally open those doors, it will be like winning the World Series. 
I'll just be speechless." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Funding Setback After Another 
</P>
<P>
The museum will serve as the interpretive center for Scripps, the nation's 
oldest and largest oceanographic center. Scripps has operated an aquarium and 
museum in various locations since shortly after it was founded in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades, however, Scripps has wanted to replace the existing 
aquarium but has suffered one funding setback after another. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said that UC San Diego, the oceanography institution's educational 
parent, was unable to fund the project by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that the aquarium is a public service funded by the 
university, which has a long list of priorities," he said. "The aquarium 
program is just part of our institution. Our main thrust is as a scientific 
institution, and accommodating our students is the highest priority." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, however, officials announced the receipt of a $6-million donation from 
the Delaware-based Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation. In addition to the $1.6 
million they received from private donations locally, they still must raise 
another half-million dollars to complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie has an enthusiastic answer to that. No problem, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission's blessing on the new aquarium was the last hurdle to be 
cleared before the university could solicit bids on the project beginning next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finishing up design details right now," he said. "As soon as the final 
drawings are done, this project will be ready to go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
The aquarium will display mainly Pacific Coast marine life, including that of 
the kelp beds off La Jolla and the vibrant sea life along the California and 
Baja coasts. 
</P>
<P>
But the aquarium's goal will be to attract support for marine science in 
general, Wilkie said. "We have public education goals to increase the 
understanding of the ocean and stress the point that its resources need to be 
used wisely." 
</P>
<P>
Though much larger than its predecessor, the new aquarium will be be about 
one-fifth the size of the privately owned Monterey Bay Aquarium. But that 
doesn't bother institute officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the community would support something on that scale, certainly 
not here in La Jolla," Collins said. "We don't do any advertising. Our role is 
to provide a public service for the people of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out hustling promotion. We take a different approach than in 
Monterey or at Sea World." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the old aquarium is uncertain, Wilkie said. "There's some 
structural damage, some severe corrosion," he said. "We won't know how bad it 
is until we vacate the building. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to use the place as a site for some scientific collections owned by 
the university -- geologic and vertebrate collections. But right now the fate 
of the building is unknown." 
</P>
<P>
The new aquarium, Wilkie said, will be a better for both people and fish. For 
the marine life, the image might be one of inmates getting a new prison with 
expanded cells. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say 'prison,' " Wilkie said. "Actually, we're trying to provide the 
closest thing we can to a natural habitat. The proximity to fresh salt water 
allows us to keep species healthier and alive longer than many other aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
"And besides, we'll have reproduction occurring in our tanks. That doesn't 
happen in prison."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER SUSPECT BEATEN BY INMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two brothers charged with ordering the murders of their elderly parents 
in Brentwood has been beaten in jail in an attack his lawyer says may have been 
ordered by someone who feared the man's future testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Woodman, 39, was punched and kicked by two fellow inmates who called 
him a "rat" -- a jailhouse term for one who testifies against another 
defendant, according to Woodman's attorney, Jay Jaffe. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Woodman, his 45-year-old brother, Neil, and three alleged hit men have 
been charged in the 1985 slayings of Gerald Woodman, 67, and Vera Woodman, 63, 
who were shot to death after returning to their Brentwood home from dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe has proclaimed Stewart Woodman's innocence in the case. Jaffe said the 
person who ordered the attack may have implied from his remarks that Stewart 
Woodman was going to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say they are not certain who was behind the Aug. 24 attack on 
Stewart Woodman. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Wednesday, Los Angeles Municipal Judge David Horowitz ruled that one 
of the alleged triggerman in the murders, former Los Angeles policeman Steven 
Homick, 49, had been legally extradited in the case from Nevada's Death Row, 
where he was awaiting execution after conviction in an unrelated triple murder.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Nancy Hoover Hunter refused Wednesday to turn over a list of 
the first 10 defense witnesses because he doesn't believe that the prosecution 
will rest its case next week. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brewer Jr. told U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam that, according to a 
prosecution list, there are 16 witnesses remaining in that phase of the trial 
and "they will directly affect the type of defense that we will put on." 
</P>
<P>
He and co-counsel Richard Marmaro have discussed "a distinct possibility" that 
they will call between zero and hundreds of witnesses, Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if we're going to call 10 witnesses," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hunter's attorneys presented a potential witness list that contained 
529 names "in an abundance of caution." However, they have previously estimated 
it will take three weeks to put on their defense of the former Del Mar mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts related to the giant J. David &amp; Co. Ponzi 
scheme, which defrauded about 1,200 people out of nearly $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Brewer, Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo said she plans to call 
only six more witnesses. Hugo also complained to Gilliam that the handing over 
of documents related to individual witnesses -- called discovery in legal terms 
-- is "a one-way street." 
</P>
<P>
"The government has never gotten up and ranted and raved (that) we haven't 
received any discovery," Hugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam did not make any ruling on the issue of the first 10 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The trial resumes today with IRS Agent Paul T. Perry under cross-examination by 
Marmaro.

<P>
Jack David Mooers, 57, a part-time professor of education at San Diego State 
University, was charged Wednesday by a federal grand jury in San Diego with 
conspiring to manufacture and possess marijuana with intent to distribute, the 
U.S. attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooers' half-brother, James Wesley Johnson, 44, and Bartolo Mercado-Espinoza, 
26, a Mexican national, were charged with the same offenses. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. William Braniff said the four-count indictment charges each 
defendant with conspiring to manufacture and possess marijuana with intent to 
distribute and with manufacturing and possessing marijuana with intent to 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the defendants face a minimum mandatory penalty of five years in 
prison and maximum penalty of up to 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Randy Jones said that a recent search of the home owned by 
Mooers in the 19000 block of Deerhorn Valley Road in Jamul turned up 614 
marijuana plants and an additional 400 pounds of marijuana that had been dried 
and packaged for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. today in the courtroom 
of U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee.

Seven cars parked in a garage outside an Oceanside apartment complex caught 
fire Wednesday, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The automobiles and garage were engulfed in flames at 2:19 a.m. when 
firefighters arrived at the two-alarm blaze in the 400 block of Brooks Street. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline poured from the vehicles' burned fuel lines, causing an extreme fire 
danger, said Greg van Voorhees, an investigator for the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of the complex heard an explosion, ran outside and saw two cars 
burning. She reported the blaze and attempted to control it with a fire 
extinguisher, but the blaze spread to the other five cars. Heat from the 
explosion damaged two additional cars nearby and a building 50 feet away, Van 
Voorhees said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained by 4 a.m. Its cause is under investigation.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA

<P>
Police arrested a woman and a man Wednesday after witnesses heard gunshots and 
then reported seeing the woman beat an unidentified man with a handgun, force 
him into her car and drive away, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafaela Mendoza, 33, and Domingo Mendoza, 27, relationship unknown, were 
arrested at 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after several people heard gunshots in the 
200 block of Otay Valley Road, said Carol Bahler, a spokeswoman for the Chula 
Vista Police Department. Bahler said the two were booked on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista police found the suspects and the victim, who suffered gunshot 
wounds to the stomach, in the 1000 block of Raedel Street in Southeast San 
Diego. The victim was taken by ambulance to UC San Diego Medical Center, where 
he was undergoing surgery late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 Ford LTD with no license plates was impounded at the scene. Bahler said 
a .44-caliber revolver was found in the vehicle.

EX-PROBATION OFFICER TO STAND TRIAL IN AMBUSH KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former probation officer was ordered Wednesday to stand trial in the ambush 
slaying of a girlfriend, a nurse who authorities said was shot when she stopped 
her car to help a man who appeared to be injured in the street. 
</P>
<P>
A Studio City doctor identified Giles Aubrey at a preliminary hearing in San 
Fernando Municipal Court as the man he saw rise from the pavement and shoot 
Lucille Marie Warren, 40, of Inglewood on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Aubrey allegedly lay in the street in the hills above Studio City, apparently 
pretending to be injured, a few blocks from a residence where Warren worked as 
a night nurse, until she passed on her way home. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeon Philip Quilici testified that he was driving on Montcalm Avenue when he 
saw Aubrey on the ground next to Warren's parked car. Quilici said he saw 
Warren get out and run toward Aubrey. Detectives have said they believe that 
Warren thought that the man was injured, although they do not know whether she 
recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
Quilici said that as Warren reached the front of her car, Aubrey stood up, 
holding a small, dark object, which detectives say was a gun. As Quilici drove 
past, he heard three gunshots, looked in his rear-view mirror and saw Warren on 
the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She had been shot four times, once in the head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the surgeon testified, he saw Aubrey following him in an orange 
car. He said he saw Aubrey's face and knew immediately that it was the same man 
he had seen on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Quilici testified that he was afraid that Aubrey was going to harm him, but 
they came to an intersection and Aubrey drove in another direction. Quilici 
said he returned to give Warren emergency aid, using a section of a neighbor's 
garden hose to give her oxygen until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Warren died four hours later without regaining consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D'Arbo testified Wednesday that he was driving through the area when he 
saw Warren lying in a pool of blood on the road and saw an orange car driving 
away. D'Arbo said he could not see the driver's face, but used his car phone to 
report the car's license plate number to police. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities traced the car, registered in Arkansas, to Aubrey. He was arrested 
two days later at his home near Inglewood, where he lived with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's son and daughter, ages 14 and 15, told police that their mother, who 
was divorced, had dated Aubrey for two months before her death. The children 
told authorities that Aubrey had known their mother for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Aubrey was working as a hospital janitor. He had 
served as a Los Angeles County probation officer for a year in 1981, but left 
the job because of mental problems, including depression and anxiety, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Edwin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said Aubrey was jealous of Warren, suspecting that she was seeing other 
men, although there is no evidence she was. 
</P>
<P>
Aubrey, who spent about five months in the County Jail's mental ward until 
doctors decided that he was competent to stand trial, faces the death penalty 
if convicted because of the special circumstance that he lay in wait for 
Warren, showing extra premeditation, Greene said.

BILL COULD FIX PIER, BUY GLASGOW STRIP 
</P>

<P>
Repairs on the Manhattan Beach Pier and the purchase of a controversial strip 
of land along the San Diego Freeway in Hawthorne would be financed under a 
tentative agreement among legislative leaders to split about $48 million to pay 
for dozens of public works projects across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation made public Wednesday night, $500,000 would be earmarked 
for the pier, and $200,000 would be used to buy the so-called Glasgow strip in 
Hawthorne -- a proposal that Gov. George Deukmejian cut from the state budget 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects in the package, which lawmakers hoped to insert into 
legislation late Wednesday night or today, had been vetoed by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), chairman of the Senate Natural 
Resources Committee, said the governor has indicated that he would consider 
approving what he regards as a more fair allocation of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale said he is uncertain whether Deukmejian will sign the proposal. In 
recent years, Deukmejian has agreed to similar proposals put together in the 
closing days of the legislative session, which ends Friday. The list of 
projects was still being finalized Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, confirmed that there is a basic 
agreement and that the state Department of Parks and Recreation staff is 
reviewing projects. He said it is conceivable that some projects could be 
removed from the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The $48 million would come from a variety of sources, including park bonds, 
highway funds, the Proposition 70 park bond of 1988 and the new Proposition 99 
tobacco tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale said the funding levels were determined by the governor and the 
Democratic and Republican caucuses of the Assembly and the Senate. The senator 
said the aim of staff negotiators was "to do something reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Manhattan Beach Pier has been plagued by cracked and falling

$82,500 ADDED TO JUDGMENT AGAINST POLICE IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury added $82,500 in punitive damages Wednesday 
to the $5.9-million it awarded a San Pedro family last week after finding that 
Torrance police covered up for a colleague involved in a fatal 1984 traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The additional damages against Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash, Lt. Noel 
Cobbs, who recently retired, Sgt. Rollo Green, Sgt. Michael Paolozzi and 
Officers Steven Burke and Richard Silagy fell far short of the nearly $18 
million in punitive damages requested by lawyers for the family. 
</P>
<P>
But John Rastello, whose 19-year-old son, Kelly, died in the collision with 
Green, said he is happy with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I said five years ago that the money really didn't matter," Rastello said. "It 
is about time this was laid to rest and that we go on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seven-Week Trial 
</P>
<P>
The trial against the county's third-largest police department lasted for seven 
weeks. Rastello's lawsuit alleged that Green caused the fatal collision by 
driving drunk and making an illegal left turn and that fellow officers 
concealed his responsibility as part of a pattern of whitewashing police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Rastello's lawyers said Green was given special treatment in several respects: 
The off-duty sergeant was not given a blood-alcohol test; a field supervisor 
used one of the department's few untaped phone lines to report in from the 
scene of the accident; Green was not arrested but was driven home by police, 
and Green was given just one field sobriety test more than an hour after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Kelly Rastello caused his own death by speeding and 
failing to apply both brakes on his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
The jury did find Rastello 25% responsible for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ordered Nash -- Torrance's police chief for 19 years -- to pay the 
bulk of the punitive damages, $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We really held Nash and the city more culpable for condoning that type of 
activity and just looking the other way," said juror Julie Nameth, a housewife. 
The other officers "are guys who we felt got caught up in a cover-up, and some 
of them maybe even reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
Cobbs was ordered to pay $10,000, Paolozzi $7,500, Green $5,000, Burke $5,000 
and Silagy $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they agreed with the plaintiff's contention that the Torrance 
Police Department routinely condoned misdeeds by officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Misconduct was overlooked," said foreman Gerald Clare, a psychotherapist. "Or 
when it was found, there was just a slap on the wrist." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relatively small punitive damage awards, jurors said, their verdict 
was intended to send a message. Said Nameth: "If they don't make some changes 
from the top, it would bother me." 
</P>
<P>
But jurors decided they did not want to break the police officers financially, 
Clare said. "What they did we felt was wrong, but it wasn't monstrous. And 
clearly everyone on both sides was distressed by the entire case." 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he and his officers still believe they did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We have pride in our police department," Nash said, "and in our officers. We 
think we run a clean police department and that we did the right thing on the 
night of the accident." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were presented with a very limited view of the department and did not 
hear about many cases in which Torrance officers have received severe 
punishments for misconduct, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he does not see the department changing policy because of the verdict 
or revelations during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are expected to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Panish, one of Rastello's attorneys, had told the jury it should award 
punitive damages of three times the original $5.9-million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Such an award would send "a loud and resounding message to all police officers 
and government officials that this type of conduct will not be tolerated," 
Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Send a Message Nationwide 
</P>
<P>
"This case means more than just the Rastello family and what they did to them 
for five years," he said. "This case needs to send a message to all police 
officers nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
"You have a unique opportunity to break the code of silence," Panish said, "to 
break the police fraternity." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Casey Yim asked for compassion. He said most of the officers 
are fathers who could not afford to pay huge damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
"If you annihilate these individuals, if you wipe them out, you've got to ask 
what kind of a message that will send to the community," Yim said. "Who will 
want to be a police officer?" 
</P>
<P>
Yim argued that the officers' reputations have already been destroyed during 
the trial and that the $5-million judgment "hung like a stone" around their 
necks. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, however, that the officers will not have to pay any of the 
damages themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police officers are routinely insured for any actions they take while 
on duty, Torrance City Manager LeRoy Jackson said in an interview before the 
verdict. If the city and its insurance company agree to follow that policy, the 
insurer would pay the $5,525,000 in damages ordered last week against the city, 
Nash and five officers. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also awarded a $375,000 wrongful death judgment against Green. Because 
he was off duty at the time of the crash, Green will have to pay that verdict 
out of his own pocket, said his lawyer, Will Pirkey. His insurance will cover 
only $100,000 of the award, Pirkey said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council must decide "on a case-by-case basis" whether to pay punitive 
damages awarded against employees, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the jury assessed punitive damages, the size of the award against 
Torrance was extraordinary, said one of the nation's leading experts on civil 
rights law. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Theodore Eisenberg of the Cornell University School of Law said lawsuits 
like Rastello's, filed under Section 1983 of the United States Code, typically 
result in judgments of well under $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is just off the charts," Eisenberg said, when told of the judgment. 
"This is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
The size of the award does not mean that the jury acted improperly, Eisenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many verdicts against police departments are smaller because the plaintiffs 
have criminal records or other flaws that make them unsympathetic to juries, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-American Boy 
</P>
<P>
Rastello, however, was pictured by his relatives during the trial as an 
All-American boy who had recently graduated from high school and had planned to 
pursue a career as an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials said they expect their insurer, Protective National Inc., to 
pay all but the punitive damages and the wrongful death judgment against Green. 
</P>
<P>
The Omaha-based company, however, has been in serious financial straits and 
under supervision of Nebraska state regulators since 1986, according to Dan 
Quine, assistant chief examiner for the Nebraska Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have ordered the company not to write any new policies, limiting 
operations only to paying off claims, Quine said. 
</P>
<P>
Quine said the company has $30 million in its surplus accounts and roughly $100 
million in assets, although much of that may be money due to Protective 
National from other, insolvent insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials insist they still have confidence in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Because Protective National was licensed to do business in this state, the 
California Insurance Guarantee Assn. protects the city, even if the company 
ultimately cannot pay the entire claim, Torrance City Atty. Kenneth Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not one of the things that keeps me awake at night," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postponement Refused 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawyers had asked Judge Abby Soven to postpone Wednesday's arguments 
to give them time to negotiate a settlement of the case with Rastello's 
lawyers. But Soven refused, saying: "This case will go to the jury today." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after last week's verdict against the Police Department, Panish 
handed a letter to defense lawyers offering to settle the case. John Rastello 
would have agreed not to pursue punitive damages against the individual 
officers if the city paid the $5.9 million in damages and an estimated $2 
million in attorney's fees immediately, said Browne Greene, Rastello's other 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But by Wednesday morning, Greene and Panish said they wanted to argue for 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawyers have never said how much the city would have paid to settle 
the case or if they would consider a settlement now, in exchange for dropping 
any appeal of the verdict.

HIGHER HANGAR RENTS IN HAWTHORNE DRAW FIRE FROM PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne Aircraft Owners and Pilot Assn. this week strongly criticized the 
City Council for increasing hangar rental fees at the airport and violating a 
1985 agreement to set the fees. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Hawthorne City Council voted to increase numerous municipal fees 
-- including hangar rental fees -- to help balance the city's budget deficit. 
Hangar fees at Hawthorne Municipal Airport, which had been raised in July to 
$210 per month, were raised again to $280 last month. 
</P>
<P>
Emil Michaels, president of the 160-member pilots association, told the council 
Monday night that the city made an agreement with the pilots in 1985 to 
increase rental fees gradually from $125 per month to $200 over a four-year 
period and then tie future increases to the consumer price index. The four-year 
period ended in July, and the index increased the fee to $210. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels, who was joined by about 20 members of the association in City Hall on 
Monday, told the council that the additional $70 increase violated the 
agreement and asked that it be rescinded. He said the association would discuss 
an increase with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert asked the staff members to meet with the 
association to study a fee increase that would be acceptable to both the city 
and the association. The City Council will reconsider the matter within the 
next month, City Manager Kenneth Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Airport Administrator Robert Trimborn 
acknowledged that the city had broken its agreement with the pilots 
association, but said the council needed to increase the hangar fees to help 
reduce the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
To offset a $2.5-million deficit in the city's 1989-90 budget and avert as many 
as 32 layoffs, the council voted last month to increase fees in numerous 
departments, including building, planning, engineering, police, airport and 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the deficit is primarily due to a projected shortfall of 
$1.1 million in sales tax revenues and paramedic fees in the 1988-89 fiscal 
year. An equal shortfall is expected for 1989-90, the officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees will raise nearly $800,000 annually, with $50,000 coming from the 
new hangar rental fees, according to city officials. The remainder of the 
deficit will be made up by personnel cutbacks, new trash collection fees, the 
repayment of a city loan to build the Hawthorne Plaza shopping center and the 
collection of delinquent sales taxes from Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees in the Middle Range 
</P>
<P>
Trimborn said that even with the recent increase, hangar rental fees in 
Hawthorne are in the middle range for area airports. The monthly rental fees 
for hangars at 10 municipal airports are between $201 and $397, he said, citing 
a 1987 state Department of Transportation study. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels said the fees at the Hawthorne airport, however, should be lower 
because the hangars are dilapidated and need substantial improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Trimborn said the city had postponed repairing the hangars because of its 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels said his group was concerned because the association was appointed in 
1985 to be the city's unofficial airport advisory committee, and the city did 
not notify the association before increasing the hangar fees. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is something that should be discussed, we are all willing to talk," 
said Chuck Walker, a member of the association and pilot for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
Trimborn said the city did not notify the association before increasing the 
fees because of the immediate need to approve the city budget and address the 
city's financial problems.

An off-duty Los Angeles police officer shot himself in the leg while loading 
his revolver at home, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Kunz, 23, was at his home in the 12000 block of Eddleston Drive in 
Porter Ranch when his gun discharged about 5:50 p.m. Tuesday, Lt. William Hall

</P>
<P>
The bullet passed through Kunz's right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Kunz, who has been a Los Angeles police officer for a year and is assigned to 
patrol duty in the west San Fernando Valley, was in good condition at Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, Hall said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE OF ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS 1ST IN L.A. COUNTY 
IN 3 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County health officials said Wednesday that last month's 
hospitalization of a Lancaster-area man with St. Louis encephalitis was the 
first confirmed human case of the illness in the county in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old man has since been released from a hospital, said Toby Staheli, 
spokeswoman for the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also reported Wednesday that mosquitoes carrying the disease have 
been caught in traps in the City of Industry and Whittier. Abatement programs 
are under way in those areas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Staheli said the ill man told officials that he had not traveled outside the 
Lancaster area before becoming sick, but no mosquitoes carrying the disease 
have been caught in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The disease, which causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, is usually 
mild in humans. Symptoms usually include fever, severe headache and nausea. In 
rare cases, it causes confusion, tremors, paralysis, coma and death. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials in May detected the virus in pigeons in the Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area in Encino. Between 1983 and 1986, 21 people living in the 
county became ill and one person died of the disease, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In humans, the disease is caused by bites from infected mosquitoes. Officials 
urged residents to eliminate stagnant water that might be mosquito-breeding 
areas.

WACHS PUSHES INQUIRY AFTER TAINTED BLOOD'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs called for an investigation Wednesday 
into regulations on the handling of hazardous and contagious materials 
following the disappearance of blood contaminated with the virus that causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
An Igloo cooler containing six vials of blood taken from patients previously 
determined to be carriers of the HIV virus were left outside the front door of 
ICS Home Health Services in Van Nuys for a courier pickup Friday night. It 
disappeared between Saturday night and Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said it is "unbelievable that vials of contaminated blood were knowingly 
left outside the building in an ordinary picnic cooler." 
</P>
<P>
"Even more shocking is the fact that a Police Department investigation 
indicates that it is a common industry practice to handle contagious materials 
in such a careless manner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
Regulation of health agencies is the state's responsibility. But Wachs' chief 
deputy, Greg Nelson, said the councilman wanted to do all he could to encourage 
more stringent laws. Wachs also is chairman of the council's Arts, Health and 
Humanities Committee, which handles city health matters. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs' motion will be reviewed by the full council Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Lewis, spokesman for the state Department of Health Services, which 
regulates laboratories and home health agencies, said the Van Nuys 
disappearance was the first he had heard of in California. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said a search of laws found nothing governing the handling and 
transporting of blood products, including those contaminated with the virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. State investigators are 
preparing a report about the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on that report, we'll decide whether there's a policy review needed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and other health officials confirmed that it is common practice for 
blood, urine and tissue samples to be left outside medical offices for couriers 
who take them to other laboratories. At ICS, a lock used to secure the cooler 
was apparently broken before the samples were left outside. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that someone took the cooler and discarded the blood. Health 
officials said the blood would be dangerous only if it entered a person's body 
through injection or a cut.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER DIES WHEN TRUCK CRASHES, BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorist was killed Wednesday when his speeding pickup truck went off a road 
north of Lancaster, crashed and burst into flames, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, believed to be in his 20s, was burned beyond recognition in the 2 
a.m. accident at Avenue D and Sierra Highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Scott McKnight said the man was driving east about 70 m.p.h. on Avenue 
D and went through a stop sign where the road ends at Sierra Highway. The truck 
crossed the highway, crashed through a wood barrier, hit a gravel embankment 
next to a set of railroad tracks and flew 54 feet before landing upside-down 
and catching fire. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County firefighters extinguished the blaze in 10 minutes. McKnight 
said there was no indication of drunk driving in the accident. The cause and 
the victim's identity were under investigation.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GENERAL PLAN TO BE UPDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council has approved a $91,570 contract with 
Cotton/Beland Associates of Pasadena to review and update the city's General 
Plan and revise its zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Terrence Belanger said Monday that the firm has already begun work 
on the revisions, which will be ready at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan was adopted in 1973, when the city's population was about 
1,500. It does not reflect changing development trends and in some instances 
conflicts with current zoning ordinances, city officials have said.

LEGISLATORS ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR DAM WORK, PARK PROJECTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A package of at least $5 million for San Fernando Valley-area projects, ranging 
from repairs for Hansen Dam to parkland acquisition in the Santa Monica 
Mountains, was included in a tentative agreement Wednesday night by leaders of 
the state Legislature to divide about $48 million for a variety of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects -- including the Hansen Dam repairs -- were cut from the 
state budget in July by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), chairman of the Senate Natural 
Resources Committee, said Wednesday that the governor had indicated that he 
would consider approving the new allocation. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale said he hoped to insert the proposal, which was still being worked 
out Wednesday night, into legislation on the Senate floor either late Wednesday 
or today. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said he believed that 
legislative leaders had agreed upon how the money would be divided. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale cautioned that he is uncertain whether Deukmejian will sign the 
proposal. But in recent years, Deukmejian has agreed to similar proposals 
cobbled together in the closing days of the legislative session, which this 
year ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, confirmed that there had 
been a basic agreement on how to divide the money. He said that when the 
governor vetoed some of the projects, he was concerned that many of them had 
been slipped into the budget at the last minute without proper review. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Brett said, the projects are being reviewed by the state Department of 
Parks and Recreation. "We don't anticipate any objections," he said. 
</P>

The $48 million comes from a variety of sources, including park bonds, highway 
funds, the Proposition 70 park bond fund of 1988 and the new Proposition 99 
tobacco tax revenue. 
</P>

McCorquodale said the funds were split among the governor and the Democratic

agreeing "to do something reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the tentative accord set aside at least $475,000 for rehabilitating 
Hansen Dam.

Funds for other Valley-area projects in the proposal included $1.7 million for 
two Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy land acquisition plans -- $500,000 for 
the Santa Clarita Woodlands and $1.2 million for Santa Susana Mountains 
property. The amount of land in each proposal was not spelled out. 
</P>

Other projects included $1.7 million for Malibu Creek State Park land 
acquisition; $1 million for the Ventura Beach Pier and $350,000 to develop 
facilities at the off-highway vehicle park at Hungry Valley near Gorman.

SANTA CLARITA SAYS NEW COUNTY REPORT UNDERESTIMATES NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County and Santa Clarita officials are at odds over the conclusions 
of a county report that predicts that the Santa Clarita Valley will need $912 
million worth of new roads, libraries, parks and other services by the year 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, members of the county's Regional Planning Commission called the 
report a valuable tool that will help them plan for the fast-growing valley's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clarita officials said the report underestimates the amount of money 
and work needed to preserve the valley's quality of life. At the urging of the 
Santa Clarita City Council, Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp submitted a 
four-page letter to the commission citing what he said were deficiencies in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Pulskamp said the county needs better information to "fully understand the 
magnitude" of the valley's coming problems. He criticized the report for not 
considering law enforcement or schools. 
</P>
<P>
The report -- prepared by the consulting firm Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; 
Mendenhall for the Department of Regional Planning -- provides a high-priced 
laundry list of capital improvement projects, compiling the expansion plans of 
state, county and other agencies serving the valley. Some are already under 
way, and others are only on the drawing board and may never be built. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first such compilation of projected public service needs in the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the valley will need eight new fire stations, 642 more acres of 
parks and six additional libraries by 2010. The largest expense facing the 
valley would be $428 million to upgrade and expand its water system, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said it would cost $178 million to complete a variety of highway 
projects. James L. Harris, a senior civil engineer for the consulting firm, 
told commissioners that the road improvements could keep traffic moving 
smoothly through the valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Problem 
</P>
<P>
Although traffic is perceived as a major problem in Santa Clarita, Harris said, 
congestion there is not as bad as in other county areas. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Strong said the report's traffic projections give the 
commission a realistic way of viewing traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clarita officials view traffic as the city's major problem, often 
calling it intolerable. Pulskamp noted that the city and the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments have said it will cost $340 million -- nearly 
twice the report's estimate -- to build road projects needed to avoid gridlock 
by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The report also addressed how the valley's public services are coping with 
current needs. Commissioner Sadie Clark said the report showed that basic 
public services are being met. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not experiencing any immediate problems," she said.

ORANGE COUNTY HOME SALES DOWN 20% IN AUGUST FROM A YEAR AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Home sales in Orange County dropped 20% in August from a year ago, according to 
TRW Real Estate Market Information. 
</P>
<P>
But last year was an unusually hot year for home sales, so this year's dip in 
sales was anticipated and represents a more normal market, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
TRW estimated that 4,431 homes were sold in the county in August, compared to 
5,613 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a home was $251,959, which includes both condominiums and 
houses. That rose 12% from a year ago, when the price was $195,023. 
</P>
<P>
TRW includes sales of both new and used homes in its calculations. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good news for the real estate industry in August's figures: The 
numbers represented a 28% increase in sales from July, probably because lower 
mortgage rates lured more buyers into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3,461 homes were sold in Orange County in July, TRW said. The average 
price was actually a little bit higher in July, at $252,987.

U.S. Ambassador to Geneva Morris Abram charged today that Soviet-style 
socialism is responsible for creating millions of refugees and said Moscow 
should help repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Moscow paid no contribution to the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees while the United States alone contributed $119 
million this year, a quarter of the organization's 1989 budget, although it 
bore no responsibility.

SENATE VOTES SMOKING BAN ON DOMESTIC AIRLINE FLIGHTS; 
</P>

FOREIGN CARRIERS INCLUDED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to premanently ban smoking aboard all 
domestic airline flights, crushing the opposition of tobacco-state lawmakers 
and their allies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory for the majority of airline passengers who don't want to 
breathe other people's cigarette smoke," said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg 
(D-N.J.), the sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Senators adopted the anti-smoking language on a voice vote after first cutting 
off debate meant to stall the measure, 77 to 21, and rejecting a bid to kill it 
on procedural grounds, 65 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was included as an amendment to an $11.9-billion, 1990 appropriations 
bill for the Transportation Department and related agencies that was headed for 
easy passage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Chance for Modifications 
</P>
<P>
The last chance for tobacco-state senators to modify the anti-smoking stand 
will come with a Senate-House conference set up to negotiate all differences in 
the underlying money bill. The House voted only to make permanent the current 
ban against smoking on flights of two hours or less, which had been due to 
expire in April. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition passed by the Senate not only would cover all domestic flights 
of U.S. carriers but also foreign airlines that fly between U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Today's crucial vote to impose debate-limiting cloture -- adopted after 
tobacco-state senators threatened a filibuster to stall the bill -- was 17 
votes more than the 60 required. It was cast without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're closing in on the day when the air will be cleared in all airline cabins 
in the United States," Lautenberg declared. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco interests say there is no proof that cigarette smoke endangers 
nonsmokers and argue that there are plenty of other chemicals in recirculated 
aircraft cabin air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights Ignored 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the total ban said the rights of smokers were being ignored 
because they are now in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how the rights of the minority in this case can be protected," Sen. 
Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) said during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that is what this place (America) was all about," Ford, a smoker, 
added. "The majority governs, but the minority's rights are protected under the 
majority governing." 
</P>
<P>
Ford said it would be difficult for smokers to go without cigarettes for the 
four or five hours -- plus additional hours in the plane but on the ground -- 
required for transcontinental flights. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) launched the final attempt to kill the ban, 
arguing unsuccessfully that the appropriations measure was not the proper place 
for such action. 
</P>
<P>
His point of order was upheld by Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), the presiding 
officer at the moment. But that stand was overruled by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Hollings accused Lautenberg of "government by ambush" in putting the smoking 
ban on the transportation money bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to be a body of ambush, chicanery and fraud, or are we going to 
adhere to process and have the issue heard?" Hollings asked.

An enraged Zsa Zsa Gabor cursed a Beverly Hills policeman for stopping her 
Rolls-Royce, slapped him hard enough to bend his sunglasses, screamed, "Do you 
know who I am?" and "spit a little bit" during a traffic stop, the officer 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
"She closed the door and she spun around and slapped me on the side of the 
face. I was very surprised," 6-foot, 4-inch motorcycle officer Paul Kramer 
testified during Gabor's trial in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was the first prosecution witness as testimony began in what both sides 
agreed is a trial about "arrogance and insolence." 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show this is a case about arrogance, impudence, insolence, 
disrespect and disregard for law by the defendant on June 14, 1989," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Elden Fox said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William Greysen agreed in part. "This case is about arrogance 
and insolence. It's about the arrogance and insolence of Officer Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was obviously on edge during the officer's testimony, frequently 
whispering to her attorney, "That's not true."

$225 MILLION IN START-UP MONEY FOR SUPER COLLIDER APPROVED BY SENATE

The Senate gave final congressional approval today to a $225-million down 
payment on the $5-billion experimental atom smasher planned for northern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The money was included in a compromise measure providing $18.6 billion for next 
year's federal energy and water programs, which lawmakers approved on a 
unanimous voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was the first of the 13 annual appropriations bills for government 
agencies for fiscal 1990 to be sent to President Bush for his signature. Bush, 
who lists Texas as his official residence, is expected to sign the legislation. 
Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $225 million for the superconducting super collider would be for 
initial construction expenses of what ultimately will be a 53-mile circular 
underground tunnel about 25 miles south of Dallas. The rest would be for 
research and development. 
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to take up to seven years to complete, will be used by 
scientists to hurl beams of protons into each other in a search for the basic 
building blocks of the universe.

William (Fishbait) Miller, a colorful figure who served as doorkeeper of the 
House of Representatives for nearly 25 years, has died after a long illness. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who introduced six Presidents at joint sessions of Congress in his long 
tenure and wrote a book, "Fishbait," about the politically powerful in 
Washington, died of a heart attack at his home here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For years Miller would stride into the House chamber and bellow, "Mister 
Speaker, the President of the United States" in his native Mississippi accent. 
The joint session of Congress would applaud, and Miller would take a seat at 
the front of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
During his 25 years as House doorkeeper, Miller introduced Presidents Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford when they appeared to address the 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the simple title, Miller's job entailed supervising 357 government 
workers -- messengers, pages, restroom workers, janitors -- and a $3.5-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Miller went to Washington in 1933 at the request of William Colmer, whom he had 
just helped win election from Mississippi's 6th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
Miller rose from a clerk in the House to messenger, sergeant-at-arms and 
finally to the relatively powerful post of doorkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one session, Miller held the job until 1974, when the House 
Democratic majority did not reelect him.

Maritime traffic resumed on the East River today, and bridges were reopened 
after removal of a tank barge that ran aground and spilled 75,600 gallons of 
gasoline, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The barge, carrying a cargo of 96,000 barrels or about 4.03 million gallons of 
gasoline, ran aground Wednesday night just north of the Triborough Bridge, said 
Petty Officer Jeff Crawley. Most of the spilled gasoline was expected to 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
The Triborough Bridge and a railroad bridge that had been closed to avoid 
igniting fumes were reopened 6 1/2 hours after the Morania 440 struck bottom 
about 150 to 200 feet offshore in a rocky channel.

Christer Pettersson, sentenced to life in jail for the 1986 murder of Swedish 
Prime Minister Olof Palme, surprised his appeals court hearing today by 
confessing to 600 robberies.

<P>
"I robbed 600 people between 1970 and 1977, two each week. . . . Most of them 
were amphetamine dealers," he told the Stockholm appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson, 42, a self-acknowledged alcoholic and amphetamine addict, had 
already been convicted of 63 crimes, including a 1970 murder, when a Stockholm 
district court by a split decision on July 27 found him guilty of assassinating 
Palme.

The 82-year-old director of the New York City Ballet and its affiliated School 
of American Ballet said he will step down Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Kirstein and Balanchine, who died six years ago, founded the school in 1934 
after Kirstein got Balanchine to move from Europe. The dance company was begun 
in 1946. Kirstein is a writer on cultural topics as well as a novelist and a 
poet, and has tried recently to devote more time to writing.

Caribbean tourism ministers rejected Cuba's application to join the the 
Caribbean Tourism Organization, but said it could be considered in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Baltron Beth, chairman of the 29-member CTO, said the group's Council of 
Ministers has "deferred" Cuba's application. 
</P>
<P>
"But the door is left open in the fulfillment of certain requirements," 
especially the recognition of the government of the island of Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba has consistently refused to grant Grenada official recognition since the 
1983 U.S.-led invasion that dislodged the Marxist People's Revolutionary 
Government.

Switzerland has extradited to the United States the alleged ringleader of a 
scheme to extort $10 million from the E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Swiss 
authorities said today.

<P>
Bruno Skerianz, who has dual citizenship in Argentina and Italy, was turned 
over to U.S. marshals in Geneva and flown to the United States, the Swiss 
Justice Department said. 
</P>

Skerianz and four other suspects face charges that they tried to sell the 
chemicals company stolen documents related to Du Pont's production of Lycra, a 
trade name for spandex. Spandex is a stretch fiber used in such products as 
underwear, bathing suits, stockings and exercise outfits.

The industrial states of the Midwest and Northeast are pulling out of the 
population doldrums and adding people once again, the Census Bureau reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"The industrial-based states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio continue to recover 
from the early 1980s population losses," the bureau said. "These three states 
added more population between 1986 and 1988 than in the previous five years 
combined." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Northeast's population growth between 1985 and 1988 was the 
highest since the late 1960s, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
The report came just one day after the bureau and the Department of Agriculture 
reported that the nation's rural population had halted its long-term decline.

AUGUST RETAIL SALES UP A MODERATE 0.7%; 
</P>

ANALYSTS FORESEE MORE SLUGGISHNESS FOR REST OF YEAR

<P>
Retail sales rose a moderate 0.7% in August because of strong automobile sales, 
the government reported today, but analysts foresee growing sluggishness in the 
remainder of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $144.3 
billion in August after a 0.5% gain in July. Sales had remained flat in June 
after rising 0.8% in May. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the report was consistent with the so-called "soft-landing" 
scenario sought by the Federal Reserve as it moves to keep inflation under 
control while permitting continued, but slower, economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the August figure is 
"an indication of continued but slow growth in the current economic expansion, 
which is now in its 82nd month, so it's good news." 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, which represent about 20% of retail sales, advanced 2.6% last 
month, driven by end-of-model-year sales incentives and the threat of steep 
price increases for 1990 models. Those sales had risen 1.7% in July. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm, 
said: "Auto sales have peaked. They came in low (in early September). October 
will be way down. So total retail sales will be down." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will see a decided weakness in auto spending in the fourth 
quarter," agreed Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up only 0.2% in August. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods, big-ticket items including autos that are expected to 
last more than three years, rose 2.4% on top of an 0.8% gain in July. On the 
other hand, sales of non-durable goods fell 0.4% after rising 0.4% a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and William K. MacReynolds, director of forecasting for the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, attributed the strength in durable goods sales to lower interest 
rates and discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are willing to spend money, but they have to be enticed," Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the durable goods category, building materials advanced 2.2% and furniture 
and other home furnishing sales gained 1.6%, reflecting in part, analysts said, 
both increased home sales and remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
The only advances in the non-durable goods category were apparel sales, up 1.1% 
in part because of back-to-school clothes shopping, and drugstores, up 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
But general merchandise sales, including department stores, did not benefit as 
much from the back-to-school spending, analysts said, and fell 0.9%.

The new president of a North American securities regulators group said today 
she plans to enlist Canada and Mexico in the battle against stock fraud by 
linking them to a U.S. enforcement computer network. 
</P>
<P>
"To fight international securities fraud, we will need a truly global system 
for spotting and tracking violators," Susan Bryant said at a conference of the 
North American Securities Administrators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This step will make North America the first continent in the world in which 
grass-roots securities regulators will be 'wired together' in order to fight 
securities fraud and abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement computer link-up will be an expansion of the Central 
Registration Depository, which contains information on more than 425,000 U.S. 
broker-dealers, stockbrokers and other investment promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, U.S., Canadian and Mexican securities officials would be 
able instantaneously to share information on new enforcement actions, suspected 
investment schemes and illicit promoters.

AUTOMATIC 'DEATH PENALTY' UNLIKELY FOR GATORS' ATHLETICS, NCAA SAYS

<P>
An NCAA official said today that it is unlikely that the University of Florida 
would face an automatic "death penalty" for Gators' athletic programs because 
any investigation of rule violations would have to be completed by January. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it's not guaranteed there is a case," David Berst, assistant 
executive director for enforcement, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a major violation and process it before January of 1990," he 
said, adding that it's unlikely that the NCAA could close a case in less than 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether the NCAA has even launched an official investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any intention of disclosing that," he said, but he acknowledged 
that investigators are aware of grand jury testimony from Florida athletes who 
said they received money from members of the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Under legislation passed in June, 1985, programs found in violation of NCAA 
rules twice during a five-year span automatically qualify for the death penalty 
-- a one- or two-year suspension of the program. The Florida football program 
was placed on probation in 1984.

Mark Guthrie allowed five hits in 7 1/3 innings as Minnesota defeated Toronto 
2-0 today, capping a series in which the Blue Jays faced three Twins rookies 
but lost a half game from their American League East lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon pitched a hitless 1 2/3 innings for his 30th save, making him the 
first reliever with five straight 30-save seasons. Only two other relievers, 
Dan Quisenberry and Lee Smith, had four straight. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto now is 1 1/2 games ahead of Baltimore after losing three in a row for 
the first time since June 30-July 2 at home against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, 2-1, followed impressive performances by David West and Kevin Tapani. 
The three allowed the Blue Jays 17 hits and three runs among them as Toronto's 
lead shrank even though Baltimore lost two straight to the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, a 23-year-old left-hander who began the season in Class AA, walked two 
and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
He ran into trouble in the eighth, when Glenallen Hill led off with a single 
and was forced at second by Manny Lee. After Lloyd Moseby singled, Reardon came 
in and got Mookie Wilson to ground into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays starter Mike Flanagan, 8-10, yielded seven hits and stranded eight 
baserunners in six innings. He couldn't escape unscathed in the third, when the 
Twins scored their first run. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Gladden led off with a single, advanced on Kirby Puckett's grounder and 
scored on Brian Harper's single to center. It was Harper's 53nd RBI of the 
year, just 17 fewer than he had in parts of nine previous major-league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, the Twins got another run on Greg Gagne's RBI double.

NO. 2 MICHIGAN HAS A HUGE LINE, BUT IT MAY NOT SLOW DOWN NO. 1 NOTRE DAME

Michigan's offensive line, anchored by 330-pound tackle Greg Skrepenak, will 
have the heaviest hitters in Wolverines history when the team, ranked second in 
the AP college football poll, meets No. 1 Notre Dame on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, nobody is quite certain what Skrepenak weighs. The team has to take 
him across from Michigan Stadium to Godfrey Moving and Storage to find scales 
that will hold him. 
</P>
<P>
The depth chart provided by the Michigan sports information department lists 
Skrepenak at 320, but offensive line Coach Jerry Hanlon scoffed at that. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep weighing him, but I don't even ask anymore," Hanlon said. "We'd like 
him to get down to 320, but I don't think he's there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Even assuming Skrepenak does weigh 320, the Wolverines' offensive line is the 
heaviest in school history, averaging 293 pounds per player. 
</P>
<P>
The front five consists of Tom Dohring, 290; Dean Dingman, 292; Steve Everett, 
270; Joe Cocozzo, 294, and Skrepenak. That is almost enough to blot out the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that when Reggie McKenzie and Dan Dierdorf played on what is 
considered one of the Wolverines' great lines in the early 1970s, that line 
averaged 225 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's offensive line of Mike Brennan, Tim Ryan, Mike Heldt, Tim Grunhard 
and Dean Brown averages only 253 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether we're strong enough," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "We're 
giving away 50 pounds a man." 
</P>
<P>
But winning the war in the trenches will not guarantee Michigan a victory. The 
Wolverines also dominated the offensive front last year, but Notre Dame's Ricky 
Watters scored on an 81-yard punt return and Reggie Ho kicked four field goals 
as the Irish won 19-17. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we have here," Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler said earlier 
this week. "We know we have some players at some positions that are very good. 
We have some at other positions that aren't experienced enough. That could be a 
problem to us." 
</P>
<P>
He also fears his behemoths might be too slow for Notre Dame, which has great 
quickness, especially in skill positions. 
</P>
<P>
"At the skill positions, offensively, we probably match up pretty well," 
Schembechler said. "But we don't have that great speed that they have at 
quarterback. There isn't any way we're going to be able to match that from a 
running standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice set a school record by rushing for 700 yards 
while leading the Irish to the national championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a much better Notre Dame offensive team than we faced in the 
first game a year ago," Schembechler said. "It's a veteran offense. It has the 
speed."
