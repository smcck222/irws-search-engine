4-YEAR-OLD'S LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Paralyzed Girl Sues to Attend Local School," (Metro, Sept. 5): 
</P>
<P>
Four steps and a Los Angeles Unified School District policy are preventing 
Xochitl Soto from attending Bushnell Way School, three blocks from her home. 
The 4-year-old preschooler must use a wheelchair for mobility and the school 
isn't ramped. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two obstacles, the policy is the larger barrier because it is based on 
centuries of people with disabilities being viewed as less than people without 
disabilities and, therefore, not entitled to the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
It is not complicated to build a ramp. It is hard to admit that a policy has 
been based on a prejudiced interpretation of a federal law. 
</P>
<P>
The recent passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act says to society that 
individuals with disabilities are now guaranteed the same basic civil rights as 
everyone else.

MANDATORY STATE QUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is remarkable that the Legislature has made allowances for the provision of 
over $25,000 insurance coverage for every California homeowner against 
earthquake damage; all for $36 a year (Part A, Aug. 28). 
</P>
<P>
Legislators are to be congratulated on the one hand and admonished on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
In a state of more than 28 million, approximately 5 million are uninsured for 
medical care. This includes a significant number of blue- and white-collar 
workers who either choose not to or cannot find affordable medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
It must be clearly understood that a significant part of the high cost of 
medical care for all Californians occurs as a result of the economic loss 
suffered by hospitals and health-care providers in caring for those patients 
who are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
This injustice to the health and well-being of our citizens, who predictably 
will require medical care, is underscored by the compassion shown toward the 
potential for damages from an earthquake that may never occur or cause serious 
or significant personal and economic injuries.

JESSE JACKSON'S ROLE IN RELEASE OF HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel it is time for the U.S. government to impose some restrictions on 
private citizens such as Jackson from pursuing their own personal foreign 
policy. Jackson doesn't seem to realize that if a player continues to carry the 
ball by himself to exploit his own ambitions, it eventually reduces the 
effectiveness of the team as a whole and causes a strong resentment among other 
players.

MANDATORY STATE QUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, Gov. George Deukmejian and the gang have decided that earthquake insurance 
is such a good idea that they have the right to force every homeowner to buy 
some whether he wants it or not. 
</P>
<P>
I have a few questions, though. 
</P>
<P>
Where does the government get the power to force people to insure their private 
property? Why does the government think it is proper to engage in a business 
that is best handled by private enterprise? Why is it proper for the government 
to seize a person's property because he refuses to insure it? When did we, the 
people, decide that government should do our thinking for us? 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Gov. Deukmejian. You have convinced me to vote Libertarian.

DON'T UNDERRATE TEHRAN'S CYNICISM;

<P>
IT HAS TO KNOW IT'S PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran, which condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, now hints at a degree 
of sympathy for the aggressor. Do these unexpected noises signal a basic shift 
in Tehran's policy, just two years after its brutal eight year conflict with 
Iraq finally ended? That seems unlikely. Seizing the moment, Iran appears 
instead to be acting with cold opportunism to further its own tactical goals, 
not the least of which is keeping Saddam Hussein securely tied down someplace 
else while Iran struggles to rebuild its war-weakened economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend," runs the old Middle East adage. Iran's 
leaders, for all the hopeful talk that their harsh attitudes may be mellowing 
and their dogmatic policies moderating, continue to regard the United States as 
the foremost of their ideological foes, the embodiment of all they most despise 
in the modern world. Iraq is now confronting that enemy. Iraq therefore 
deserves to be regarded if not exactly as a friend, and surely not as an ally, 
then at least as something of a kindred spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Saddam Hussein has done all within his power to win Tehran's 
political support. Confronted with a formidable American buildup in Saudi 
Arabia and the Persian Gulf, he moved quickly to pacify Iran, humiliatingly 
yielding to all of its demands for ending the state of war between the two 
countries. Beyond this he has solemnly taken to echoing the fire-breathing 
slogans that the leaders of Iran's Islamic revolution themselves so dearly love 
to utter. 
</P>
<P>
His fight, he proclaims, is on behalf of Islam and against the West, in defense 
of national rights and against the shame and horror of neo-colonialism. The 
Iranians are undoubtedly too smart to swallow this hypocrisy. Hussein, after 
all, has always prided himself on running one of the region's more aggressively 
secular regimes, and if his attempted grab of Kuwait doesn't qualify as naked 
colonialism then nothing does. But no matter. It's not the honesty of the 
thought that counts but how it comes out sounding. What the Iranians are 
hearing, even if they doubt its sincerity, is ideological music to their ears. 
</P>
<P>
The big question, of course, is what practical effect all this might have. The 
early hint from Tehran that it could mean Iraq will now begin to get some 
material help from Iran, in exchange for Iraqi oil, was quickly denied. That 
doesn't rule out some cross-border movement of goods. But Iran must be careful. 
It can't afford to be seen openly violating the U.N. Security Council embargo 
on Iraq, since that could subject Iran in turn to U.N.-approved sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's main aim is probably just to keep the Iraq-U.S. confrontation boiling 
away for as long as possible, without itself risking any direct involvement. 
Certainly the last thing it wants to see is an Iraq made politically stronger 
and grown even more arrogant for having successfully defied the United States. 
Iran is risking very little by tacitly siding with the most visible current 
enemy of the Great Satan. Saddam Hussein, on his part, can only be grateful for 
any little bit of encouragement he can get.

GANG WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
LATEST VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let us all hope -- and, where appropriate, pray -- for the return to health of 
one Jonathon Fabian, an unarmed resident of the city of Lynwood in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently in a hospital bed at Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
/Drew Medical Center, struggling against critical stomach wounds sustained in a 
cold-blooded gang shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon Fabian was not armed when he was surrounded by three teen-age boys and 
plugged point blank by one of the gang members carrying a handgun. They then 
escaped and are now the target of a police manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon Fabian is of course not the first victim of youth gang violence in 
1990: As of Wednesday morning there had been 116 gang-related murders in 
unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County this year alone (112 in all of last 
year). 
</P>
<P>
And of course he surely won't be the last. Gang violence in some parts of 
Southern California is out of control, and it is probably due to the 
geographical location of the shootings -- generally not in the higher-income 
areas -- that more isn't being done about the problem. Yes, if these crimes 
were occurring in places like Brentwood rather than Lynwood, more would be 
done, no question. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being unarmed, Jonathon was not a known member of any gang. He had no 
criminal record and was not thought to be in any way a problem to the 
community. Nevertheless, police apparently believe that he was deliberately, 
not accidently, shot, and are deeply puzzled by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Victim Jonathon Fabian, you see, is 2.

EXCELLENCE CLOSE TO HOME; 
</P>
<P>
INCREASING THE TALENT POOL WHERE IT HAS BEEN MOST NEGLECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, the state of public schools in Los Angeles -- indeed, nationwide -- 
is not usually a subject that elicits cheers. But there's a new public school 
in East Los Angeles that does just that. 
</P>
<P>
It's Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School, a privately financed, 
$45-million-dollar school that was built in 27 months on 3.5 acres of land. It 
proves, says board of education member Roberta Weintraub, that new public 
schools don't have to take five years to build and don't need mammoth plots of 
land. It should be a model for private-public partnerships in improving 
education, Weintraub says. She's right. 
</P>
<P>
But Bravo Medical Magnet does even more. It encourages and trains future 
physicians and medical technicians. Bravo and a similar school, the smaller 
King/Drew Medical Magnet High School in South Los Angeles, are increasing the 
pool of talent where it has been most neglected: among Latinos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 students attend Bravo; the curriculum includes courses not usually 
taught in high school, including classes in biomedical research and nursing. It 
also has an affiliation with Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center that will 
give students greater exposure to the real world of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
While the school is open to students throughout the district, its Eastside 
location is close to the homes of many Latinos, who make up about 56% of the 
students. (King Drew also draws students from all over the city; 60% of its 
students are African-American). 
</P>
<P>
More than examples of what can be right about public education, these schools 
are crucial to the nation's increasingly high-tech future. The fast-growing 
number of Latino and black children are seriously under-represented in the math 
and science fields. Thus the creation of more Latino and black scientists, 
mathematicians, nurses and physicians becomes not only a matter of community 
pride but national necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo will help make a difference, and to that we say -- what else? Bravo.

PUTTING A PREMIUM ON TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confidence is crucial in banking, so it's important to quell any anxiety over 
the fund that insures the deposits in commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, there has been mounting concern over the fragility of that fund, 
which protects each bank deposit up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that the rapid depletion might lead to another taxpayer bailout like 
the savings and loan debacle, Democrats and Republicans have joined the Bush 
Administration in proposing that bank regulators be given the discretion to 
raise premiums that banks pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Premium increases are now limited to 7.5 cents per $100 in deposits every year. 
So next year banks will pay 19.5 cents per $100 in deposits, up from the 
current 12 cents. The fund may need more. 
</P>
<P>
Troublesome real estate loans and plunging property prices have caused big 
losses for some banks nationwide. California banks so far have escaped the 
troubles experienced by northeastern banks. 
</P>
<P>
But nationwide, 15 banks have folded, and another 20 could fail by the end of 
the year. The insurance fund is down to $13.2 billion from $18.3 billion two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office Tuesday warned that an economic slump -- a 
recession -- could bankrupt the fund. The Congressional Budget Office released 
a study on Wednesday predicting that 631 banks could fail in the next four 
years resulting in cumulative losses of $20 billion to the insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
The banking industry is not in as bad a shape as the thrifts. It has a stronger 
capital base. Bank regulators have been more stringent in their oversight and 
have moved more quickly on problem banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the banking situation is worrisome enough -- and we don't need another 
bailout burden. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers have argued that higher premiums will be onerous, especially if the 
credit crunch worsens and the cost is passed on to depositors. 
</P>
<P>
And bankers are hungering for reforms to expand financial services in order to 
be more globally competitive; Congress should listen to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But bankers need to go along with the premium hikes to maintain confidence.

Pete Sampras, who won the U.S. Open Sunday, was defeated by Jay Berger Thursday 
at the All American Tennis Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who lost, 6-0, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), had trouble on the clay courts. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was played on clay because one competitor, Michael Chang, will 
be on clay next week during U.S. Davis Cup play in Austria, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay's a very good competitor, especially on clay," Sampras said. "I started 
off real slow. I had absolutely no timing." 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round action in the $210,000 tournament, Chang defeated Tim 
Mayotte, 6-1, 6-4, and Aaron Krickstein beat Richey Reneberg, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The event , which is now in its ninth year, only has American contestants. The 
field consists of eight men and four women. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, the defending tournament champion, said of Sampras: "Clay is not his 
best surface." Berger also said: "Pete has been through a couple of tough weeks 
and I've had a week off. And although he's the U.S. Open champion, it was nice 
to see he hasn't changed. There's no aura around him like Lendl, mainly because 
I've known Pete for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Women's competition starts today, with U.S. Open quarter-finalist Mary Joe 
Fernandez taking on Amy Frazier and Ann Grossman meeting defending tournament 
champion Kathy Rinaldi, the Amelia Island touring pro.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
STRAWBERRY STIRS METS, SLICING PIRATE LEAD TO 1 1/2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game headlined as a pitching duel between Dwight Gooden and Doug Drabek, 
outfielder Darryl Strawberry stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry hit a three-run homer, giving him 100 runs batted in, and threw out 
Barry Bonds at the plate as the New York Mets moved to within 1 1/2 games of 
first-place Pittsburgh in the National League East by beating the Pirates, 6-3, 
Thursday night at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, before a season-high crowd of 51,079, was the Mets' 11th in a row 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Both starters struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden (17-6) survived a shaky start and went on to win for the 14th time in 
his last 15 decisions, giving up 10 hits and three runs in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek (19-6) lasted only four innings. He gave up four runs on six hits. John 
Franco set a Mets' record with his 32nd save in 36 chances, breaking Jesse 
Orosco's mark of 31 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry and Bonds, leading candidates for the NL most valuable player award, 
put on dazzling displays in a game the Mets said they had to win after losing 
three in a row at Pittsburgh last week. The Mets and Pirates finish the season 
with three games at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds went four for four, drove in two runs, stole two bases and robbed Gregg 
Jefferies of a home run with a leaping catch above the left-field fence in the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry gave the Mets a 3-2 lead with his 34th home run in the fourth inning 
after Tommy Herr singled and Dave Magadan walked with none out. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get inside on Darryl, but I left it over the plate," Drabek said. 
"That was the kiss of death." 
</P>
<P>
In his last 21 games, Strawberry has seven homers and 20 RBIs. He is tied with 
Kevin Mitchell and Ryne Sandberg for the NL home run lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Strawberry kills us," Pittsburgh right fielder Bobby Bonilla said. "But we put 
him in situations where he could." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry has 11 hits against the Pirates this season and eight have been 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bonds: "It's OK, we'll see them for three games at Pittsburgh at the end 
of the season. We knew it would be rough here." 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, attempting to become the Pirates' first 20-game winner since John 
Candelaria went 20-5 in 1977, gave up four runs on five hits in the fourth and 
left in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Philadelphia 5 -- Jerome Walton's fielder's choice ground ball with 
the bases loaded scored Joe Girardi, breaking a tie at Chicago and giving the 
Cubs their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Girardi led off the eighth with a single off loser Roger McDowell. Doug 
Dascenzo walked, and Dwight Smith, hitting for winner Paul Assenmacher, reached 
first safely when left fielder Von Hayes dropped his fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Dykstra fell out of the NL batting lead for the first time since May 2, 
going one for five to lower his average to .33521. Willie McGee of the St. 
Louis Cardinals -- traded to the Oakland Athletics last month -- left the NL at 
.33533. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Andre Dawson played his 2,000th major league game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Montreal 4 -- Rookie Ray Lankford homered and drove in two runs, 
Pedro Guerrero had four hits and rookie Omar Olivares got his first major 
league victory as the Cardinal won at Montreal.

Barry Larkin couldn't get down a bunt, so he picked up the Cincinnati Reds 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin fouled off two bunts, then hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning 
Thursday night to give the Reds a 7-5 victory over the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
The victory increased the Reds' lead in the National League West to 6 1/2 games 
over the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, with the Dodgers starting a 
three-game series tonight in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I couldn't get the bunt down," Larkin said. "It's something I 
practice every day. When you're hitting second and there's a man on first, 
you've got to be able to get the bunt down. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think (Manager Lou Piniella) was going to take the bunt off, but he 
did. After I hit it, it starting hooking a little bit. I was around first base 
and I gave (first base coach Tony Perez) a high-five, but I still didn't know 
if it had gone out." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble (7-3) pitched the ninth for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis hit a three-run homer in the seventh, giving the Reds a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros hit a season-high four home runs. Glenn Davis hit his 22nd, a 
two-run shot to give Houston a 5-2 lead in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Yelding, pitcher Bill Gullickson and Ken Caminiti also hit home runs for 
the Astros.

THE PACIFIC 10; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A LONG WAY FROM PARITY TO CORVALLIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific 10 football coaches constantly talk about parity, saying that the 
conference is relatively strong from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite, if early-season results are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
The league apparently has a doormat in Oregon State. The Beavers have already 
played the two weakest teams on their schedule, losing to Montana, 22-15, and 
to Kansas, 38-12. If Oregon State can't beat Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, it 
figures to be a long season for Coach Dave Kragthorpe's team in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska lies ahead, and so do seven Pac-10 teams -- Stanford, Arizona, 
Washington State, UCLA, Arizona State, USC and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, coming off a 59-10 rout by Virginia, recorded eight sacks for 70 yards 
in losses while building a 31-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks, a perennial second division team in the Big Eight, aren't 
accustomed to routing anybody. The Jayhawks haven't had such an easy time since 
they beat Kansas State, 38-7, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It's the oldest ruse in any playbook, but it still works. 
</P>
<P>
We're referring to the gimmick play, the fumblerooskie. 
</P>
<P>
It worked for Air Force against Notre Dame last year, and it worked again for 
Arizona against Illinois Saturday night in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Rick Martin ran 24 yards for a touchdown around the right side with a 
purposely fumbled handoff as his teammates -- and Illinois players -- dashed 
off in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy gave Arizona a 21-3 lead on its way to a 28-16 victory over the 
previously 11th-ranked Illini. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Quiz: California's John Hardy ran 100 yards to a touchdown with an 
intercepted pass against Wisconsin, tying a Pac-10 record held by five other 
players, three from UCLA. Can you name them? 
</P>
<P>
Glyn Milburn originally wanted to attend Stanford and signed a letter of intent 
to that effect. It was invalid, however, because it wasn't signed by a parent 
and Milburn was 17 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
So the former Santa Monica High star enrolled at Oklahoma, the school his 
stepfather favored. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn played as a true freshman under Barry Switzer in 1988, gaining 124 
yards in eight carries, and scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he turned 18 and no longer needed his parents' approval of his 
choice of schools, he transferred to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 175-pound Milburn sat out the 1989 season but is now a 
multipurpose threat as a ballcarrier or kick return specialist for the 
Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn is a cousin of Rod Milburn, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist in the 
110-meter high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't have beaten USC today," said Washington center Ed Cunningham after 
the Huskies had hung on to beat San Jose State, 20-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, San Jose State also extended Washington before losing, 35-31. 
</P>
<P>
In barely getting by the Spartans, the Huskies maintained a recent trend, as 
noted by guard Dean Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been here, this team plays to its level of competition," he 
said. "Every game is close. For some reason, we rise (or fall) to the level of 
the opponent, whether it's the No. 1 or No. 100 team." 
</P>
<P>
Quiz answer: California's Jim Jurkovich against USC, 1940; UCLA's Jimmy Allen 
against Cal, 1973; UCLA's Alan Dial against Oregon State, 1986; Arizona's Chuck 
Cecil against Arizona State, 1986, and UCLA's Dennis Price against California, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Bruce Snyder said he has a physical football team after the Bears' 
28-12 victory over Wisconsin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal had 38 running plays and threw 22 passes. Last year, the Bears passed on 
seven out of 10 plays with quarterback Troy Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin, though, may not be an accurate gauge of Cal's new prowess. The 
Badgers were 2-9 last season. More will be known about Cal after it plays Miami 
Saturday at Berkeley.

HOUSTON HANDLES TEXAS TECH WITH KLINGLER'S 5 SCORING PASSES

<P>
David Klingler, quickly making University of Houston fans forget about 1989 
Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, threw five touchdown passes for the second 
game in a row as 18th-ranked Houston outlasted Texas Tech, 51-35, in a 
Southwest Conference game that lasted nearly four hours and produced 1,014 
yards in total offense Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler, who watched Ware's near-perfect season last year, said he had a fair 
night in Houston's first televised game since the 1988 Aloha Bowl because of 
NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting better, but my completion ratio was not good," said Klingler, who 
completed 29 of 54 passes for 435 yards, increasing his total to 861 yards in 
two games. "It's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Klingler, a junior from Houston, got his chance when Ware abandoned his senior 
year to play for the Detroit Lions. Klinger threw a 53-yard scoring pass on the 
Cougars' first possession that got them going toward 538 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
He took Houston on three 80-yard scoring drives and another of 55 yards for a 
28-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon ran for 121 yards in 18 carries.

Seattle Coach Chuck Knox and Raider Coach Art Shell lost a combined 106 pounds 
during the off-season, helping raise $124,000 for the Miami Project to Cure 
Paralysis. For each pound lost, the charity received $500 from a liquid diet 
product. 
</P>
<P>
Knox lost 63 pounds, dropping from 236 pounds to 173, and Shell lost 43, going 
from 338 pounds to 295. Shell and Knox are featured in a TV commercial along 
with the other NFL coaches who participated: Bill Parcells of the New York 
Giants, Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, Joe Gibbs of the Washington 
Redskins and Dan Henning of the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have sold more than 1,000 season tickets since Tuesday's 
announcement that the team will remain in Los Angeles, Raider Executive 
Assistant Al LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, however, won't disclose the total number of season tickets sold 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
After installing the run-and-shoot offense, the Seahawks punted nine times and 
were shut out at Chicago in their season opener last Sunday, 17-0, prompting 
cynics to label the new offense the run-and-boot. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Krieg, who signed a five-year, $7.5-million contract during training camp, 
was sacked three times, threw three interceptions and passed for 97 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shell has refused to say who will start at tailback for the Raiders in 
Sunday's game at Seattle, it appears that Marcus Allen is going to get the nod 
over Vance Mueller, according to Mueller, who started at tailback last Sunday 
against Denver. CHRIS BAKER

ANGLERS FINDING SUCCESS AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers have found some of the most productive fishing occurs after sundown. 
</P>
<P>
Night fishing on two South Bay barges, Redondo's Isle of Redondo and L.A. 
Harbor's Annie B, offers anglers a variety of fish under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend on a night trip aboard the Annie B, Jim Winters of San Pedro was 
fishing for halibut. He had several hits using small bait on the bottom, but he 
was unable to set the hook quickly as he was using only 10-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Winters said he set his rod down at the rail at midnight and started to place 
an order in the galley when his reel sang out and his rod fell to the deck. 
About 50 yards of line went out from the barge. Winters thought it was a big 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally pulled the fish near the barge, Winters discovered he had a bat 
ray. It weighed 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But not all was lost. Winters tried again -- this time with 20-pound test line 
-- to catch a halibut. After several strikes, he finally caught a flattie that 
weighed 7 1/4 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Demesko of Carson, fishing off his boat Catchem at the 209 spot, had to 
battle for six hours before catching a 150-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Bonito moved into the Marina del Rey Sportfishing dock over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The total catch through Tuesday morning was more than 500, with most being 
landed on light tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Frenchy Magillan said it was a wide-open bite and it was easy for 75 
anglers dockside to catch a limit of bonito weighing three to six pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth annual Marina del Rey Anglers vs. the King Harbor Marlin Club marlin 
catch-and-release tournament was held over the weekend with the King Harbor 
club declared the winner, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
The boat No-Biz had the top catch for the King Harbor club, a 131-pounder using 
30-pound test line. The King Harbor club's Stan Eckland had the top boat, the 
Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Cadman at Avalon weigh station reports 104 marlin have been weighed in 
since the run started. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Bill Holekamp of Long Beach received entry into the club's 
button award with his 153-pound marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Morris of Santa Monica weighed in a 143 1/2-pound marlin. Avalon resident 
Robert Faygot weighed in the largest dorado of the year at Avalon, at 37 1/2 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Frank Sardinia of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Grande at 
San Clemente Island, caught the whopper of the week, a 38-pound yellowtail out 
of the kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Schmid of Venice, fishing aboard the Equalizer at the 425 bank, caught a 
limit of skipjack. His top catch was a 22 1/4-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Williams of Torrance, fishing at the horseshoe kelp aboard the Sport 
King, caught a 21-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Goldman of El Segundo, fishing at rocky point aboard the Hitless Miss, 
caught a 19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Cheswicks of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Southern Cal, caught a 
17-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Jenson of El Segundo, fishing aboard the Spitfire, caught a nine-pound 
sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Local fishing remains steady for bonito and calico bass. Outer 
islands are yielding catches of yellowtail and skipjack. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Venice reef and anglers 
caught 200 sculpin, 20 calico bass and two halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman, on a half-day trip, returned with 30 sand bass, 10 bonito, five 
halibut and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 360 rock cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished rocky point and found a wide-open 
bonito bite. Anglers sacked 270 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Redondo, on two half-day trips, returned with 301 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special, on two half-day trips, returned with 245 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The barge Isle of Redondo had a catch of 420 mackerel, 63 rockfish, 48 bonito 
and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The First String fished San Nicholas Island for rock 
cod and chalked up 498 rock cod, 24 sculpin and 18 sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo, on a half-day trip, returned with 52 calico bass, 18 barracuda 
and 12 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>

Island for a variety catch -- 65 calico bass, 50 blue perch, 30 opaleye, 12 
bonito, 10 rockfish and two barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun fished the rigs and returned with 60 bonito, 27 calico bass, five 
sheephead and five blue perch. 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 850 mackerel, 311 jacksmelt, 160 
kingfish, a halibut and a bat ray. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory's trip to rocky point had limits of 
bonito with 193, plus 51 calico bass and 12 barracuda.

CSUN BOASTS STUBBORN VOLLEYBALL COMPETITOR IN UNASSUMING SWALEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be fooled by Shelly Swalec's bashful nature. Behind that gentle smile and 
peaceful spirit is a fierce competitor. If nothing else, persistence is 
Swalec's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
It carried her through the disappointment of being cut from the Cal State 
Northridge women's volleyball team two years ago and it was an ally last season 
when Swalec made the team but was limited to a few appearances. Diplomatically, 
she tempered her desire to play for the good of the team, and she emerged as 
one of its strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff? After a tight battle with teammate Shana Wilson, Swalec is the 
starting right-side hitter for the 7-4 Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times people who are shy are viewed as not having self-confidence," 
Northridge Coach Walt Ker said. "But underlying Shelly's modesty is a deep 
self-confidence. Otherwise she would not have come out for the team when she 
wasn't recruited and she certainly wouldn't have come the second time. Her 
self-confidence meshes neatly with her modest qualities, but her neatest 
characteristic is that she is a positive person. She's always been one of the 
hardest workers on the team. She never complains. She is just sweet and nice 
and amazingly funny." 
</P>
<P>
Swalec's humor is unintentional. She is not clumsy; she just falls and runs 
into things more often than most people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a slapstick kind of thing," Ker said, recalling the time Swalec 
caught her ponytail in the net. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the 5-foot-11 sophomore is not so noticeable. In CSUN's attack, a 
right-side hitter is the volleyball equivalent of a blocking fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Left-side hitters, such as Northridge's Patricia Fitzsimmons and Nancy 
Nicholls, are set up more often for the kill. And right-side hitters aren't 
called on for the dinks and dumps executed so precisely by middle hitters such 
as CSUN's Marianne and Kathleen Dixon, who stand out anyway because they are 
identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
But Swalec is out there doing the dirty work -- assisting on the block, diving 
after errant balls, and making the occasional dazzling spike that reminds 
teammates, foes and fans that she is an attacker to be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest thing is defense," Swalec said, "getting balls up that people think 
won't get up." 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, making the CSUN team as a walk-on from Sterling Heights, 
Mich., is as improbable as some of her digs. One of only two non-Californians 
on the CSUN roster, Swalec was not exposed to volleyball until junior high. 
Unlike most Division I players, she did not have the advantage of playing club 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, she received no scholarship offers after high school. She wrote 
to a few schools about playing soccer but did not generate much interest. 
</P>
<P>
Then Buena High Coach Steve Burkhart spoke to Ker about her. Swalec played for 
Burkhart in the fall of 1987 while living with her mother Suzane in Ventura. 
The second half of Swalec's senior year, Suzane allowed her to return to 
Michigan to live with her father and graduate with the Stevenson High class 
that she had been with prior to moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to graduate with people I didn't know," Swalec said. "Those 
(Stevenson High classmates) are the people I grew up with." 
</P>
<P>
But Swalec left them behind after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't live with my dad in Michigan and I had a place to live out here 
with my mom and I liked (CSUN) a lot," she said. "They have an adaptive 
physical education program so I figured if I didn't make the team, I'd be at a 
good school." 
</P>
<P>
Between working and commuting from Ventura, Swalec did not get in as much 
practice over the summer as she would have liked, but she thought she had a 
chance to make the Northridge team. That is, until official tryouts started and 
the intensity picked up. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around and saw how much better the other players were and I knew I 
wasn't playing well," Swalec said. 
</P>
<P>
As picture day approached, Swalec had a sinking feeling. "I was hanging in 
there, but I knew I was going to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
The day before the team picture was shot, Ker broke the news to Swalec. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I was good, but that I wasn't ready," Swalec said. "He said I was 
welcome to come back in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
While Swalec was limited to intramurals, the Matadors took runner-up honors in 
the NCAA Division II championships. 
</P>
<P>
That spring, Ker had the time to work with Swalec. One of the first things Ker 
corrected was her "goofy foot." 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally backwards," Swalec said. "I was jumping with the wrong foot 
forward and taking too many steps. Once I straightened that out, I thought I 
had a better chance to make the team. I knew how (Ker) wanted me to pass and to 
hit and what he expected of me, and I knew the team better." 
</P>
<P>
The following fall, Swalec bid to become one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The hurt would have been really great if I was cut again," she said. "I had 
practiced all spring and summer and I don't know if I would be able to come out 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Swalec didn't have to worry. Three days before cuts were 
announced, Ker told her she had made the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I went home and called my mother and father," Swalec said. "My mom knew how 
much it meant to me." 
</P>
<P>
On picture day, she proudly donned a Matador uniform and lined up with her new 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Swalec didn't mind watching from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I would do anything as long as I was on the team," she said. "But eventually I 
wanted to be out there. But I knew the other girls were better and I knew I 
could wait my turn." 
</P>
<P>
When Keira Middleton graduated, the right-side hitting position opened up and 
Swalec took over last spring. But over the summer, Ker recruited Wilson, a 
transfer from De Anza College. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a scholarship player and I am a walk-on," Swalec said. "I thought, 'Oh, 
no, I'm not going to start.' " 
</P>
<P>
In fall drills, the pair pushed each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real close," Swalec said. "We didn't really know (who would start) 
until right before the first match. In practice I really had to go hard because 
she is really good. She can go in anytime for me and do a really good job, so 
the pressure is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Although Swalec starts, she remains a non-scholarship player. 
</P>
<P>
"It's enough to start," she said. "I don't care about the money. If people 
watch you play, they don't say, 'She's on a full ride and she's a walk-on.' I 
have financial aid for school so I don't really need a scholarship. I'd rather 
Walt gave it to a really great player that he is trying to recruit." 
</P>
<P>
Swalec is too kind; the financial aid doesn't cover it. Her mom helps pay the 
bills and she earns money by working at the adaptive P.E. Lab and in the 
intramural program at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
But it is all worth it to Swalec -- she almost needed to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I came from I never had to try out," she said. "I was one of the best, 
if not the best, in volleyball, soccer and basketball. I told myself there's no 
way (being cut) could happen. It was a pride thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Swalec cannot believe her good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Michigan. I was not recruited and I'm starting on a Division I team," 
she said. "It's like you could never imagine playing teams like UCLA, USC or 
Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine it. USC is on tap Tuesday night.

HILLOCK IS ON THE LOYOLA HOT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Loyola Marymount head basketball Coach Jay Hillock, who spent four years as 
head coach at Gonzaga, used to coach against Loyola. When he was hired along 
with Paul Westhead five years ago, Hillock says, Loyola was a "sleepy little 
campus by the beach." 
</P>
<P>
But all that changed. Hillock, who was Westhead's top assistant, helped the 
Lions rocket into basketball consciousness with a high-speed pinball style that 
rattled conventional ideas of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock was in the background as players such as Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble 
became All-Americans, and Westhead something of a marquee name, at least in 
basketball circles. The media found Westhead and his players irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead was hired last week as coach of the Denver Nuggets. Hillock, at a 
press conference on Monday announcing that he would replace Westhead as coach, 
said: "When Loyola Marymount hired Paul Westhead, they got much more than they 
expected. He was Loyola's foremost ambassador of goodwill -- exactly what this 
sleepy little campus needed. He was not a shot in the arm, but a nuclear 
explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Hillock's challenge of replacing Westhead is twofold: to maintain a successful 
basketball program and to remake his image with the players from assistant 
coach to head coach. He did that successfully at Gonzaga, but he wasn't 
replacing a guy who once led the Lakers to an NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
"Your approach has to be a little different," Hillock said. "The assistant's 
kind of a friend. The head coach is ultimately more accountable -- the head 
coach is on the other side of the desk." 
</P>
<P>
Hillock has the players' backing. When the Nuggets announced Westhead's hiring, 
the Loyola players rallied behind Hillock. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a problem if the players view him as an assistant," a former 
Loyola player said. "But Coach Hillock should be all right. They respect him." 
</P>
<P>
The other part of the equation -- maintaining a high profile -- could be more 
problematic, if Loyola views that as a goal. Westhead combined his NBA 
background and radical style with a glibness and ease with the media that few 
coaches possess. Although he said he had no sense of it, he had become a 
celebrity. His name and connections attracted players, notably transfers 
Gathers, Kimble and Corey Gaines, who helped turn the Lions into a Top 20 team. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead's name and Loyola's success helped the coaching staff attract the 
interest of several blue-chip recruits. Hillock is a low-profile guy who admits 
that those recruits will now probably opt for Arizona, UCLA or the Big East 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Paul Westhead," Hillock said. "It would be stupid of me to try to 
emulate him." 
</P>
<P>
But he will continue to run the Westhead system -- a fast-break offense and 
full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
This was going to be the year fans found out if it was the system that made 
Loyola a Top 20 team, or if it was players such as Gathers and Kimble that had 
made the system. 
</P>
<P>
Now it may be an even more intriguing angle: Does the system, once in place, 
work with a different coach at the controls? 
</P>
<P>
After saying goodby Monday, Westhead left the team with one mission: Beat Santa 
Clara. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions open the season against Santa Clara in the Maui Classic, then play 
the Broncos twice in the West Coast Conference, and could face them again in 
the WCC Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward John O'Connell said the Lions consider Santa Clara more of a 
bitter rival than Pepperdine. "The best tribute we could pay (Westhead) is to 
knock 'em off four times," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock didn't get much sleep Sunday night preparing for Monday's press 
conference announcing that he would replace Westhead as coach. One of the 
distractions that kept Hillock awake was a long phone conversation with his 
mentor, Gonzaga Coach and Athletic Director Dan Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock's ties to Gonzaga run deep. Younger brother Joe is the top assistant 
coach there, and Hillock and Fitzgerald talk frequently. For Hillock, that 
means some missed sleep. Fitzgerald is one of those people who function on a 
few hours of sleep, and he's liable to call at 2 or 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Fitz late Sunday," Hillock said. "He was really happy for me. He 
said there's only two days a year we'll not be able to speak." That is Feb. 7 
and Feb. 16, when Gonzaga and Loyola play each other. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount baseball standout Tim Williams, who suffered an eye injury in 
a drive-by shooting incident last weekend while riding in a car with teammates 
Darren Sugiyama and Todd Gates, on how close a call it was: "This car got 
behind us, tailgated us for about a half-mile. I was sitting in the back seat. 
Darren switched lanes (to let the car pass) and for some reason I slid over. 
They pulled up, then a shotgun appeared and blasted through the side window 
where I'd been sitting. If I hadn't slid over, I probably would've been 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
Williams wasn't hit by the shotgun pellets, but glass from the window went into 
his right eye and he had the lens removed surgically early Sunday morning. The 
lens can be replaced as an implant after some healing and Williams expects to 
return to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Williams on a scary 24 hours at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital: "In the 
emergency room all I could say was, 'Am I gonna lose my eye?' They said there's 
a chance. But when I went into surgery, losing the eye seemed secondary to 
getting rid of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up with patches over both eyes. Coming out of anesthesia, I didn't know 
where I was at. I tried to reach for my eyes and my hands were strapped down. I 
started yelling and screaming at everybody. They actually had to call a 
security guard. I was gonna try to tear those straps out. I finally calmed 
down. My dad spent the day with me, he was watching the football game on TV 
while I got the radio version. Finally I got the patches off at 5:30. I spent 
the whole day not knowing if I could see."

EL CAMINO AND TAFT SQUARE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino College football Coach John Featherstone calls Saturday's matchup 
between the Warriors and Taft the community college game of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (1-0) are the state's top-ranked team, according to the Junior 
College Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Taft is rated third. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, both teams went to the Pony Bowl undefeated, and El Camino walked away 
with 24-7 victory and a national championship. El Camino hasn't forgotten that 
game, which many believed the Warriors didn't stand a chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Taft is always very strong on both sides of the ball," Featherstone said. 
"They always have a fast, physical defense and an absolute machine on offense. 
This will be the test for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' offense, which features a lot of running, looked impressive in 
last week's opener against Ventura. But Featherstone said things will be 
different Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a question, Taft will be the toughest defense we will face this 
season," he said. "We'll really know where we're at in terms of our running 
game after Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars haven't played this season, so Featherstone is basing his 
prediction on Taft's strength and consistency throughout the years. Last year 
the Cougars went undefeated (9-0-1) and beat Bakersfield in the Shrine Potato 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Game time is 7 p.m. at El Camino's Murdock Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor College will open its season against visiting Victor Valley on Saturday 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Valley lost to Porterville, 14-10, in its opener last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks and the Rams are unranked and looking to improve last year's 
dismal records. Under first-year Coach Don Weems, Harbor finished last in the 
Northern Division of the Western State Conference with a 2-7 record, 3-7 
overall. Victor Valley (0-8, 1-9) finished last in the nine-member Foothill 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest is off and plays Harbor on Sept. 22.

VAN NUYS LOSES KEY RUNNING BACK; BIRMINGHAM HOPES TACKLE CAN RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The most promising running back at Van Nuys High is out for the season, and 
Birmingham, which lost two of its best linemen over the summer, is hoping one 
will return in time for its opener against University on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys' Harold Boudreaux, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound running back, will have to 
sit out his junior year because of grades. 
</P>
<P>
Wolves Coach Kenji Mochizuki said that he was "expecting quite a bit from 
(Boudreaux) this year." Boudreaux, who also would have started at linebacker, 
missed the first three games last year but finished with more than 300 yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham's Ivor Lising, a 5-foot-8, 180-pound senior tackle, is awaiting 
grades for two summer classes in which he enrolled to raise his grade-point 
average to the required 2.0, according to Coach Chick Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been trying to locate his grades," Epstein said. "He is doing all the 
legwork, but in the meantime he has missed two weeks of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said Lising is "extremely quick" and the team's best defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
While Epstein is uncertain whether Lising will be back, he is sure to miss 
veteran lineman Robert Tarasewicz, a two-year starter at offensive tackle. 
Tarasewicz, a 6-1, 240-pound senior, moved to Seattle with his family. PAIGE A.

DUE TO THE KING WINS BY A HEAD ON OPENING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BURGART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On an opening day of upsets, Due To The King justified his favorite's role by 
coming from behind to beat Candyman Bee by a head in the $53,850 Foothill 
Stakes at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in tight quarters around the first turn, Due To The King moved between 
horses into the far turn and collared pace-setting Candyman Bee in the final 
strides of Thursday's 6 1/2-furlong feature for 3-year-old thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke good but had trouble into the first turn," winning jockey Julio 
Garcia said of his horse. "I dropped behind before letting him go." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's strategy worked when Candyman Bee set quick fractions of 21 1/5 for 
the opening quarter and 44 2/5 for the half. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured we would be about two lengths off the pace," said Jim Dotson, who 
trains Due To The King. "This is a long-striding horse, and I was concerned 
about him handling this track.' 
</P>
<P>
Due To The King had no trouble with the turns on the five-eighths-mile oval, 
finishing in 1:16 1/5 while recording his fifth victory. Earlier this summer at 
Del Mar, Due To The King came from off the pace and defeated older sprint star 
Valiant Pete, covering six furlongs in 1:08 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Paying $4.40, Due To The King earned $31,350 and ended the day's drought of 
seven consecutive losses by the thoroughbred favorites. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big upsets was in the co-featured $42,880 Bustles and Bows Stakes, 
in which Frank Olivares rode 15-1 outsider Brazen to a three-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Showing good early speed from her outside No. 10 post, Brazen opened a 
three-length lead in the far turn and covered the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would be farther back than I was," Olivares said. "When Martin 
(Pedroza) didn't move, I just let her run." 
</P>
<P>
Pedroza rode runner-up Ifyoucouldseemenow. Saratoga Success rallied to finish 
third in the field of nine 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares picked up his 17th local stakes victory while moving into fourth place 
among winning jockeys at Pomona. Trainer Jerry Fanning recorded his 20th Pomona 
stakes victory with Brazen, remaining the second-leading conditioner in stakes 
victories at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
No patrons correctly tabbed six winners in the Pick 6. Today's carryover is 
$14,083. . . . With temperatures of about 98 degrees, the attendance of 6,780 
was down from the opening-day crowd of 7,900 last year. Total mutuel handle was 
$2,218,913, down from the $2,376,533 of last season. . . . Julio Garcia was the 
only jockey to win more than one race. Besides taking the feature, he also 
scored with Sergeant Jay Tee in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo Dasher became the first quarter horse stakes winner, beating Here Comes 
The Band in the First Down Dash Handicap. It was the gelding's fifth 
consecutive victory. . . . Quarter horses will be in the spotlight today when 
four trials for the PCQHRA Breeders' Futurity are presented. 
</P>
<P>
Today's top thoroughbred attraction is the $37,240 Las Ninas Stakes for 
3-year-old fillies. Mama Simba, an impressive maiden winner at Hollywood Park 
this summer, is the likely favorite in the 6 1/2-furlong feature.

John Siman had been out of water polo for six seasons before he returned to 
coach at Buena High this season. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, he saw what he had been missing. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the demonstration came from Buena's opponent, Harvard High, which 
defeated Buena, 20-2, in the first round of the Millikan tournament at Wilson 
High in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They were intense, fast and aggressive," Siman said. "I hope to see my team 
play the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jim Toring scored five goals, three in the third period, and Mark 
Townsend and Ryan Salceda each scored three goals for Harvard (2-0). Brian 
Border and Matt DeFronzo each scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to come together as a team," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said. 
"The chemistry is already there and the kids are feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard will play Anaheim Canyon in the second round today at 1:30 p.m. at 
Wilson High. ADAM BENSON

The drivers are calling San Diego's Budweiser Cup the most important stop in 
the HFC Hydroplane boat racing series. It is the 10th of 11 on the 1990 tour, 
and if someone is going to make a move to overtake series points leader Tom 
D'Eath, it will have to be done on Mission Bay this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Defending national champion Chip Hanauer, second and 573 points back in the 
overall standings, said he plans to catch D'Eath Sunday. But don't expect any 
drama here until then. The Budweiser Cup will hold time trials today and 
Saturday, beginning at 9 a.m., but no one will see much of Hanauer and his Miss 
Circus Circus boat (which set a lap speed record of 158.87 m.p.h. here last 
year) during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if we'll make six runs in two days," said Hanauer, 36, who last won 
the San Diego event in 1987 but has won more national championships (four) than 
any other driver the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably make three," said George Woods Jr., the 1988 winner and third 
overall driving Jif Presents Mr. Pringles. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer and Woods said that unless a racer is new to a course or his boat 
requires a lot of adjustments, the trials offer no incentives. Many curtail 
their qualifying activity because of the salt water, which often causes the 
boats' turbine engines to fail if they get too wet. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Hanauer solicited the support of other drivers and made a 
proposal to institute a points award to the top qualifier for each race. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put up 20-25 points for the top qualifier, you'd set up some great time 
trials," he said. "Basically, what it amounts to right now is two days of 
testing. We don't want to subject the turbines to the salt water any more than 
we have to." 
</P>
<P>
The drivers voted in favor of a time-trials points system and sent their two 
representatives, Jim Kropfeld and Ron Snyder, before the Unlimited Racing 
Commission's Competition Board. But the board, according to Kropfeld, never 
acted on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
So with his sights set on Sunday, Hanauer knows a victory in any of the four 
heatswill bring 400 points. Secon is worth 300 points, third 225 and fourth 
169. All of a sudden, 573 doesn't look that far away for Hanauer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a substantial lead, but we have overcome a bigger lead in the past with 
two events to go," said Hanauer, currently the winningest active racer with 34 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
He also a blew a seemingly insurmountable lead, close to 1,000 points, in 1986 
when he failed to qualify in San Diego, raced badly in Las Vegas and saw 
Kropfeld pass him. 
</P>
<P>
"The unthinkable happened," he said. "We basically didn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer will show up Sunday, but you might not see much of him until then. 
</P>
<P>

SOCKERS, COLLINS AGREE TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In one day, the Sockers agreed to terms with one of the rare commodities in 
indoor soccer -- a proven American midfielder -- and invited to camp a former 
member of the Moscow Dynamo. If he makes the cut, he would be the first Soviet 
national to play in the Major Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
The names are Michael Collins and Alex Golovnia. Guess which is which. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, considered one of the top playmakers in the MSL, was with the St. 
Louis Storm last year but never saw eye-to-eye with Coach Don Popovic. In 39 
games, Collins collected 17 goals and six assists. He spent the previous two 
seasons with the Los Angeles Lazers, scoring 48 goals and adding 56 assists in 
95 games. 
</P>
<P>
But Socker Coach Ron Newman said Collins was offered a contract because of his 
guile, not his scoring. Collins, 28, has been in the league since 1981 and 
developed a strong passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"We need that type of player," Newman said. "We've got quite a bit of foot 
speed, but we need someone who can pass the ball, someone with experience who 
knows what the indoor game is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Collins has not signed a contract but is expected to after arriving for the 
start of training camp Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Collins will aid the Socker offense, but the team still needs 
help in back. Since last season, three players -- fullbacks George Fernandez 
and Ralph Black and goalie Zoltan Toth -- have defected to other teams. Another 
defender, Cacho -- whose 41 blocked shots was fourth on the team last year -- 
likely will not be offered a contract because he is 32 years old. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves room for Golovnia. Newman saw him play when the Dynamo met the 
Sockers in an exhibition in 1987 at the Sports Arena. Golovnia assisted on 
Dynamo's second goal; the Sockers won, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't Newman's memory that brought Golovnia here. It was forward Rod 
Castro's recommendation. This summer, Castro and Golovnia played together for 
the Orlando Lions of the American Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Now Golovnia, 30, wants to stay in this country, and Castro says his skills 
will allow him to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"He reads the game very well," Castro said. "And he knows what the forwards are 
going to do. I really pushed for (the Sockers) to take a look at him, to get 
him in here and to sign him." 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether he can adapt to indoor soccer. Castro is certain he 
can, saying Golovnia's outdoor style of play parallels the Sockers' control 
game. Newman wasn't quite so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from that background, he has the pedigree, which must mean he has the 
necessary tools," Newman said. "The question is how long will it take him to 
adapt to the indoor game." 
</P>
<P>
Also invited to camp, which gets under way at 9 a.m. Monday was Bob Lilley, a 
defender from the Hershey Impact of the National Professional Soccer League. 
Last year, he had 20 goals, 16 assists and 84 blocks.

Although Crawford High's mistakes kept it off the scoreboard in its opener at 
Sweetwater last week, Chuck Faucette, Crawford's first-year football coach, 
still held hope when he looked up late in the third quarter and saw his team 
was trailing by only 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe things were too tight, because at that point, Crawford players started 
going down with muscle cramps. Not just one or two players, but more than a 
quarter of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point we almost ran out of people," Faucette said. "We (the coaches) 
had to run out onto the field and say, 'You can't come out, son, there's nobody 
else to go into the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Sweetwater began taking advantage of Crawford's misfortune and 
tucked away a 20-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
So early this week, Faucette tried to figure out how to prevent the same thing 
from happening when the Colts play at Patrick Henry tonight at 7:30. The quirk 
is that the home team is busing in. Crawford also plays its home games at 
Patrick Henry. 
</P>
<P>
What Faucette came up with was the idea of a team pregame meal. It seems few of 
Crawford's players ate before the opener, fearing food would not mix with the 
butterflies. The lack of sustenance, Faucette reasoned, contributed to the 
muscle cramps. 
</P>
<P>
The meal might help, but Faucette knows the main factor was sheer fatigue. He 
brought only 23 players with him to Sweetwater, six of whom had to leave 
because of cramps. This week, there may be 25 (including quarterback Phil 
Parker, who missed the Sweetwater game because of an injured knee), but that's 
roughly half the 44 to 50 players Patrick Henry Coach Jerry Varner will suit. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond fatigue and cramps, Faucette must also concern himself with Patrick 
Henry quarterback Luke Lowrey. He was the county's second-best passer last year 
with an average of 212.6 yards per game. Last week, Lowrey was 13 for 20 for 
217 yards and two touchdowns in a 14-0 victory over Granite Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts will defend Patrick Henry's passing attack not with a strong rush but 
with a speedy secondary. Strong safety Chris LeChance (11 tackles, 10 solo, 
against Sweetwater) and cornerbacks Lamont Horton and James Hester will try to 
keep Lowrey from hooking up with tight end David Paul and wide receivers Brent 
Dulin and Eddie Jabbour.

TEXTOR'S 'BIRTHRIGHT' ISN'T SATIRIC, JUST SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A press release calls "Birthright," at the Attic Theatre, a "dark comedy which 
satirizes the blind pursuit of wealth." Playwright/director Douglas Textor is 
traveling in Mamet country, but unfortunately the map he's following is by Dr. 
Seuss. 
</P>
<P>
His play can't really qualify as satire because it's miles down the road from 
the county seat of Satire, which is the town of Reality. Nor is it absurdist as 
the author claims; again, only reality can be made absurd. It's just silly, and 
doesn't begin to take potshots at the real world of high finance, shady or not. 
</P>
<P>
Textor does pay homage to some better known absurdist playwrights. As in 
Christopher Durang's work, his second act doesn't have anywhere to go, and like 
John Guare he throws in wild and crazy to cover lack of characterization. Like 
John Ford Noonan, his focus wanders, but at least Textor's command of English 
is his own -- "Love is an anachronism for lesser mortals." 
</P>
<P>
The author's direction is as silly as his play, and even confounds the talents 
of Patrick Washburn as the non-hero, who looks as though he has some comic 
flair, and Carolynn Stevens as the careerist who always bests him, who almost 
manages to make some of Textor's lines sound as though they have some meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6562 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends 
Oct. 14. $12; (213) 462-9720. T.H. McCULLOH

COMEDY OF FEMALE CO-DEPENDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes the idea behind a play is too well shaped for the drama to be quite 
real. It's an alluring flaw -- like having physical features that are too even 
for your own good. 
</P>
<P>
Take "Sally and Marsha." Co-dependency doesn't usually free people from their 
problems but in this two-woman comedy mutual dependence is a balm. 
</P>
<P>
"Co-dependency: Can it be all bad?" asked psychologist Marilyn Ruman at a 
post-show discussion at Theatre West. Women love this play and with reason. 
Sybille Pearson is writing about female friendship, and she has a knack for 
capturing how women talk about husbands and sex and other things. 
</P>
<P>
The actresses, under Helen Murray's direction, are so flavorful they almost 
obscure the sense of calculation: the scorching one liners, the curious absence 
of husbands and children (over two acts and seven months!) and the predictable 
sparring. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula Martin's tall and loopy Sally, a chirping homemaker into self-denial, 
and Joanna Lipari's squat and literary Marsha, a neurotic Jew, are touching and 
funny. One hellish fight in the jumbled Gotham apartment is electric. But 
there's something by-the-numbers in this theatrical tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
At 3333 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 and 8 
p.m., in repertory with "Benchwarmers," through Oct. 7. $12.50. (213) 851-7977.

'PACIFIC ROOM' HAS TOO MANY COOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to go in the water of the Pacific Rim, along 
comes "The Pacific Room." This murky joint work by David Hodgson, Erika 
Sukstorf and Lui Sanchez might work if somebody were spoofing performance 
artists stricken with a case of empty pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
At the Callboard Theatre, though, nobody is spoofing. 
</P>
<P>
While it's clear who wrote -- if that's the word for it -- the seven 
disconnected portions of "Room," and crystal clear that Hodgson did the 
choreography (with bows to Etienne Decroux), it's also painfully clear that too 
many co-directors have their hands in the show. Namely Hodgson, Sukstorf and 
Sanchez, in deep need of an editor. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces such as "Ya Chou Yu," "Classroom," and "Fijian Woman" have Sukstorf 
playing with such poor East Asian and American ethnic accents that they 
unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. Sanchez's "Universo Nativo" is all 
emotion and no content, while the group pieces -- "Island" and "A Peaceful 
Space on the Edge" -- are no emotion and no content. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the work far from the Pacific Rim remains in the mind: Hodgson's 
"Du Mein Herz," sharply coupled with Schumann lieder. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8541 Melrose Place, on Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 p.m., Fridays, 10:30 
p.m., until Sept. 21. $12; (213) 466-1767.

GOMEZ-PENA TRILOGY MAY HAVE THE BUGS OUT BY '1992' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. 
</P>
<P>
In "1992," 500 years later, Guillermo Gomez-Pena regrets that journey and 
deconstructs its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbus arrived in America without papers," he points out. "Don't we all 
secretly wish he had been deported right away?" 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena arrived at the Temporary Contemporary Wednesday night with plenty of 
papers. He performed "1990," the first part of the "1992" trilogy, with his 
script in front of him, on a music stand. During most of the performance, he 
sat in a chair, flipping pages of his script as he read. 
</P>
<P>
It was an intriguing but surprisingly static experience. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's voice and microphone were his primary instruments. Make that his 
voices -- he switched languages, accents and timbres throughout the evening. 
The languages included English, Spanish, "Spanglish" or "Inglenol," Nahuatl, 
Donald Duckese and his own patois. All of this was accompanied by an eclectic 
musical soundtrack, controlled from a cassette player at his side. 
</P>
<P>
"Time to change the cassette," he repeatedly announced before doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "1990" could have been appreciated just as well by a radio listener -- 
and in fact, a radio version is being broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there wasn't something for the eyes as well as the ears. In the first 
half, Gomez-Pena wore a shiny mariachi outfit, and during intermission he 
donned a post-modern Aztec warrior get-up, complete with giant headdress, 
long-haired wig -- and sneakers. His chair was bounded by a semicircle of 
candles to roughly approximate an altar. 
</P>
<P>
He moved beyond the microphone only at the beginning and end of acts, using 
props to mime a suicide in front of a TV set, a swig of blood from his own 
heart, and a snake-swallowing reminiscent of the image on the Mexican flag 
banner at his side (a U.S. flag banner was on the other side of the stage). 
Most notably, he ended the first act with a fierce round of rope jumping, 
wearing a death mask, bathed in red light. 
</P>
<P>
Still, through most of the performance he remained seated like a disc jockey. 
And in this large and distancing space (compared with most of the 99-seat 
theaters in town), that's a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem wasn't only Gomez-Pena's self-imposed limits on physical 
mobility. It was also the disorganization of his often lyrical material. 
</P>
<P>
The script switched gears often, apparently at random, sometimes cutting off 
thoughts before they bloomed. Slim shards of Gomez-Pena's autobiography were 
dropped willy-nilly, not in chronological or any other order. Because nothing 
seemed organized along any lines -- linear, circular, triangular, whatever -- 
the presentation developed a sameness, despite the shifting gears. 
</P>
<P>
When the show broke for intermission, many around me thought it was over, until 
an announcement informed us otherwise. And the second act was not particularly 
different from the first. 
</P>
<P>
If Gomez-Pena's point had been to make a commentary on randomness, his method 
might have served a purpose. But Gomez-Pena has nothing so abstract in mind. 
His point is much more pointed. 
</P>
<P>
He is examining the appropriation of America by European culture. He salutes 
those first "brave illegal aliens" who crossed the Bering Strait 40,000 years 
ago and mourns the dislocation in their descendants' lives, including that part 
of himself that is descended from them. 
</P>
<P>
Though raised in Mexico City, he announces that he is now a Chicano, despite 
his continued identification with Tijuana as well as San Diego. And he clearly 
has mixed feelings about it -- though, oddly, the reasons he ventured north in 
the first place go unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
His theme is a perfect match for that of the Los Angeles Festival, of which 
this program is a part. Considering Gomez-Pena's obvious skills as a poet and a 
master of the microphone, his performance ought to be one of the festival's 
watershed events. But right now "1990" sounds like an in-progress reading, a 
rough draft.

 At 152 N. Central Ave., nightly through Sunday at 8 p.m., with a Sunday 
matinee at 2 p.m. $15; (213) 623-7400.

NORTH BEACH SERVES UP MANLY MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
By now everybody must have heard about the Venice Ballerino. On a building at 
Rose Avenue and Main Street stands an animated ballerina mannequin, gracefully 
raising and lowering her leg, with an oversized male clown face stuck over her 
head. Tourists take photographs; locals dream of vandalizing it. 
</P>
<P>
It might do for Venice what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, or come to think of 
it what the canals were supposed to do for Venice. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of restaurant locates itself under the Sign of the Ballerino? Perhaps 
a place with a gorgeous turquoise aquarium behind the bar and a rugged sheet of 
copper with water flowing down it decorating one wall? Yes, all that, but don't 
be deceived. North Beach Bar &amp; Grill looks chichi but it's actually a 
hairy-chested, old-fashioned steak house. 
</P>
<P>
It revels in aggressive flavors. Lots of anise goes into the oysters 
Rockefeller, and plenty of Parmesan, garlic and anchovy in the Caesar salad. 
The steamed clams come in a broth with a booming note of garlic and marjoram, 
visible flecks of red pepper floating around in it. With the fried zucchini 
(good fried zucchini, not too soft) comes a honey mustard, with the accent 
heavily on the mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp appetizers (I'd take the beer-battered shrimp over the tired shrimp 
cocktail) are accompanied by a solid cocktail sauce and a stunningly good 
tartar sauce, clean and fresh tasting. Incidentally, raw oysters come with the 
same cocktail sauce and a pot of horseradish, but you can usually talk someone 
into bringing a little of that tartar sauce as well. 
</P>
<P>
The hairy-chested style persists in the entrees. With your steak you get studly 
chunks of steamed vegetables and a steak knife that looks like a Bowie knife 
with a serrated blade. The waiters refer to it as the Rambo knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The filet steak is worthy of all these theatrics. It's an excellent piece of 
meat, tender and flavorful. I can't say I found the advertised bearnaise sauce, 
but it did come with a strong port wine sauce that had a breath of cilantro in 
it; not to everybody's taste, but no problem to remove. 
</P>
<P>
That's the best of the steaks. In order of increasing fattiness and gristliness 
we also find a New York steak, a rib eye with horseradish sauce and a 
porterhouse with brown butter that practically overflows the plate. Go for the 
filet. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the entrees are mostly seafood and pasta. The best of the fish, 
hands down, is the grilled swordfish with butter and capers. It's a big thick 
chunk, beautifully cooked -- essentially a swordfish steak, now that I think of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The linguine with clams is essentially the steamed clam appetizer with linguine 
added to the powerfully flavored broth. There's also a huge garlic roast 
chicken and a not terribly flavorful pork chop; the restaurant's own apple 
sauce on the pork chop is pleasant, though more like sliced stewed apples than 
apple sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The retro angle persists at dessert time. The ice cream sundae is a little 
slovenly in presentation, but it has the true old-fashioned soda-fountain 
style: a couple of scoops of ice cream surrounded by big drifts of dense 
whipped cream, with little pots of chopped walnuts and fudge, caramel and 
raspberry sauces for doctoring it. The ice cream pie, which has peanuts and 
chocolate bits as well as vanilla ice cream, is another dietarily indefensible 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The pastry on the apple turnover is on the tough side, too tough for a fork 
(you might ask for one of the Rambo knives), but the caramel sauce goes well 
with the slightly caramelized apple filling. The chocolate pecan torte has no 
big chunks of pecan but isn't oversweetened as these things tend to be. 
</P>
<P>
The best dessert I've had was on special, but I hope the restaurant keeps it. 
It's an old-time peach cobbler with the real biscuit-style crust, one of the 
few to be found in a restaurant (amazing how people can serve cobblers without 
bothering to check the recipe). 
</P>
<P>
Who'd have thought it? At the Sign of the Ballerino, they serve Real Men's 
food. 
</P>

'LIFE IS A LONG QUIET RIVER' RUNS FUNNY AND DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Etienne Chatiliez's stunningly original, provocative and darkly comic "Life Is 
a Long Quiet River" (at the Music Hall), one of the best French films of recent 
years, finds in the switching of babies at birth a rich source for social 
satire. Putting a dizzying spin on the old nature-versus-nurture controversy, 
Chatiliez introduces us two radically different households in a small 
provincial city. (You may be surprised to find yourself reminded of the 
made-in-Baltimore satires of John Waters, especially "Hairspray" and 
"Crybaby.") 
</P>
<P>
The Le Quesnoys live in a well-appointed, smoothly-run turn-of-the-century 
townhouse. Monsieur Le Quesnoy (Andre Wilms) is the head of the local electric 
company, and his determinedly smiling wife (Helene Vincent) works tirelessly at 
being the perfect wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the Groseilles are crammed into an untidy 
apartment decorated in a riot of clashing floral prints. Monsieur Groseille 
(Maurice Mons) is a skinny, tattooed deadbeat. Madame Le Quesnoy finds time to 
run up place mats for charity sales and help her song-writing, pop-singing 
priest stage his musical shows for children. All the pretty but fat Madame 
Groseille (Christine Pignet) ever does is change the color of her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Except that both families have a large number of children they would seem to 
have nothing in common and no connection whatsoever -- until they learn that 
the Le Quesnoys' 12-year-old Bernadette (Valerie Lalande) is really a Groseille 
and that the Groseille's 12-year-old Maurice (Benoit Magimel) is a really a Le 
Quesnoy. (How the two children came to be switched in the hospital where they 
were born is too hilarious to be revealed here.) 
</P>
<P>
Tone and control are overwhelmingly crucial in satire, and Chatiliez, an 
esteemed, innovative director of commercials in his feature debut, reveals 
himself to be a master of judiciousness who can tell as story with a camera as 
easily as with a pen. "Life Is a Long Quiet River" -- that title is of course 
ironic (and how!) -- is never, never merely a broad, superficial swipe at the 
bourgeoisie. The beauty of the endlessly well-meaning Le Quesnoys' agonizingly 
funny predicament when they try to do right by Maurice as well as Bernadette 
derives from the fact that their religious piety and their passion for order is 
a sincere, heartfelt expression of gratitude for their good fortune in life. 
Chatiliez's point here is that security is after all an illusion, that 
vulnerability in fact may be in direct proportion to the degree of one's moral 
rectitude, and that life is inherently absurd anyway. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, virtue and propriety are often luxuries that the Groseilles 
simply cannot afford, yet they are warm and loving. 
</P>
<P>
So often in satire filmmakers reserve sympathy for their central figures and 
caricature everyone else, but while Chatiliez can be tart, even stinging, he is 
steadfastly fair and clear-eyed. What makes "Life Is a Long Quiet River" (Times 
rated Mature for adult themes, situations) work so well is that all its people 
possess dimension, and its large cast, in which Helene Vincent is especially 
notable for never letting Madame Le Quesnoy become merely a joke, is remarkably 
disciplined yet seems always spontaneous. Of equal importance in the story are 
veteran star Daniel Gelin as the local doctor, a veteran roue, and Catherine 
Hiegel as his long-suffering nurse-mistress. Chatiliez, by the way, wisely 
doesn't dwell on the heredity-versus-environment question but clearly comes 
down on the side of environment when all is said and done.

'GRACE': THE GANG THAT COULDN'T FIT IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director Phil Joanou's wildly indulgent and artily self-conscious gangster 
melodrama, "State of Grace" opens with a St. Patrick's Day parade in grainy 
slo-mo. It's not only a ringer for Ivan Passer's opening scene in "Cutter's 
Way" -- a movie that worked -- but the way each moment is held suggests 
cinematic overkill and nothing that follows contradicts that impression. 
</P>
<P>
"State of Grace" (citywide) is played against an interesting background: the 
Irish-American gang known as the Westies whose turf was New York's reeking 
Hell's Kitchen. Or what used to reek and used to be called Hell's Kitchen until 
gentrification hit, sometime in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
After that it was called Clinton, and as one local says mournfully, "The 
neighborhood's disappeared in a tide of yuppies and dog (droppings)." Left 
beached by that tide were its Irish gangsters, a singularly cold-blooded 
collection of murderers, even by the pathologic standards of street gangs. 
Bitter and alienated, they finally tried to ally themselves with the Italian 
Mafia, and on this hangs part of "State of Grace's" plot. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Flanner (Ed Harris) now heads the Westies from the safe environs of 
upscale New Jersey, while his hotblooded and decidedly unstable younger brother 
Jackie (Gary Oldman) remains behind, taunting the Mafioso at every turn. The 
Flanners' younger sister, Kathleen (Robin Wright), has turned her back on their 
violence, to live uptown and work at a Park Avenue hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Taking Westie Terry Noonan out of that background for a dozen years, then 
dropping him back among his floundering gang members is a not-bad idea; having 
Sean Penn play him is an even better one. As the troubled Terry, whose last 12 
years have been in a very different setting, Penn has one of the most complete 
and complex characters since his father-son partnership with Christopher Walken 
in "At Close Range," and he is marvelous. While hanging out with Jackie, Terry 
also rebuilds his passionate relationship with Kathleen -- straining his 
loyalties even further. 
</P>
<P>
"State of Grace" has a poetic script by the late playwright Dennis McIntyre, 
who has an ear for the lingo ("I'm an old man and I'm eatin' stewed tomatoes 
out of a can," pensioner Burgess Meredith says, about his reduced 
circumstances.) McIntyre also has a taste for mixing grim hilarity with sudden 
mayhem. His view of these lethal, crumbling Irishmen is that they are a 
hopeless lot: on their way to back up Frankie as he parlays with a Mafia 
chieftain, the whole, sorry gang fits in the back of a panel truck and once 
loaded, no one has a clue how to get to heavily Italian Mott Street. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, what director Joanou makes of all these promising elements is 
thudding pretentiousness. His first movie, "Three O'Clock High," should have 
been a warning -- this was a young director playing with a million gimmicky 
ideas, all of them awful. His second film, the documentary portrait "U2: Rattle 
and Hum," for which "State of Grace's" lyric cinematographer, Jordan 
Cronenweth, was also a cameraman, was a very different matter, but Joanou had 
that charismatic band to work with. Now he is back dealing with actors and 
every indulgence, including a two hour and 14 minute running time, is on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Oldman, who needs no encouragement, has been allowed to start his 
performance somewhere in the stratosphere and spiral upward from there. Ed 
Harris, as the world's most muddled gang leader, is uncharacteristically muted 
and poor, lovely Robin Wright is reduced to sitting, back lit, in her 
apartment, waiting for some new disaster to burst through her door. Invariably, 
it does. 
</P>
<P>
When Joanou stages his final, hyperviolent shoot-out, his gunmen rush at each 
other, one firing from the left side of the screen, one from the right, again 
and again. So that we don't forget the Irishness of it all, Joanou cuts in the 
St. Patrick's Day paraders too, until we worry that one of them, 40 blocks away 
uptown, is going to drop dead, caught in the movie's crossfire.

'BLOOD SALVAGE' IS NOT WORTH SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never underestimate the artistic potential of a Z-budget, tasteless, 
overviolent horror movie. You could be watching something like the Sam 
Raimi-Coen brothers' "Evil Dead." On the other hand, you could be watching 
"Blood Salvage" (selected theaters). 
</P>
<P>
In this lame try at a gross-out programmer, three fanatic or cretinous 
backwoods buffoons, kidnap a bland yuppie Georgia family, the Evanses, and 
torture them for a day or two. The buffoons have something on their mind 
besides sadism -- though the filmmakers don't seem to. 
</P>
<P>
Jake "Diddy" Pruitt (Danny Nelson), and sons -- Hiram (Christian Hesler), the 
unkempt creep, and Roy (Ralph Pruitt Vaughn), the fat dunderhead -- run a 
salvage yard in the red clay forests and, sub rosa, an organ transplant bank in 
the barn. There, waylaid passengers are strapped to life-support systems and 
stowed in the burbling dark, where they moan in unison, until Ray Walston, as a 
fey doctor, hauls away another kidney or two. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's "New South" social implications are interesting: a vision of slick 
yuppies tortured by lower-class boors who dress improperly and drool, citing 
biblical scripture to justify their depravities. In addition to his transplant 
fixation, "Diddy" Pruitt has an unholy lech for the Evans daughter, April (Lori 
Birdsong) while filmmakers Tucker Johnston (writer-director) and Ken C. Sanders 
(writer-producer) seem obsessed with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" -- whose 
whacko raffishness they miss completely. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood Salvage" (MPAA rated R) is shot in an overslick style, empty of any 
overtones or undercurrents. It's laced with TV-porn shots where Birdsong -- 
distinctly unsympathetic despite her predicament -- wakes up to find her bra 
unhooked, while synthesizers groan and her buffoon-captors howl. 
</P>
<P>
To call the film's violence unpleasant is an overstatement. Its non-violence is 
unpleasant, too. The film's executive producer is boxer Evander Holyfield: KOd 
in his first cinematic outing. Also present, hooked up to another life-support 
system, is that occasionally intense actor, John Saxon. Both would have better 
off if the plug had been pulled right after "Blood Salvage's" opening credits.

'SUDIE AND SIMPSON': TRIUMPH OVER RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Filmmakers have long fed on the richness of Southern literature, but seldom has 
a movie of the rural South captured the power of friendship and love as 
evocatively as "Sudie and Simpson" (on Lifetime cable tonight at 9, followed by 
repeat broadcasts Saturday at 6 p.m. and Monday night at 9). 
</P>
<P>
Louis Gossett Jr. and Sara Gilbert (Darlene on "Roseanne") play the entitled 
characters, an outcast black man and a spirited young white girl who together 
triumph over fear and racism in a small town in Georgia in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Joan Tewkesbury and adapted by Sara Flanigan and Ken Koser from 
Flanigan's semi-autobiographical novel, "Sudie," the production is atmospheric 
(catch that permanent wave machine in the beauty shop) and redolent of love and 
squalor. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing soft at the core of this heartwarming story. A Gothic subplot 
of child molestation involving a white schoolteacher propels the emotional 
showdown, and the first image you see is a crude orange sign nailed up on a 
tree in the fictional town of Linlow: "Nigger -- Don't Let the Sun Set on You 
in Linlow." 
</P>
<P>
What's so well captured is the personal point of view of a 12-year-old girl 
rebelling against the taboos in the narrow world around her. Gilbert is 
sensational, right down to her mastery of a Georgia dialect, and Gossett is 
memorable as a survivor hiding in a shack outside of town and tending his 
secret vegetable garden. Textured support comes from Frances Fisher's staunch 
schoolteacher and an uncanny performance from newcomer Paige Danahy as Sudie's 
chubby, dim-headed girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Parents here have taught their kids to be terrified of blacks, and when Sudie, 
scampering in the woods, sees a black man in the flesh for the first time, her 
stunned reaction (and ultimate bravery) is a moment that catches your breath 
and casts writer Flanigan in the luminous path of such Southern writers as 
Harper Lee, Alice Walker and Carson McCullers. RAY LOYND

TV-RADIO: HE'S NEW BEHIND MIKE BUT DOESN'T NEED PROMPTING

<TEXT>
<P>
You have to admire Todd Christensen's timing. 
</P>
<P>
No, he's not running pass routes again. He's now a commentator for NBC, and on 
Sunday, he and play-by-play partner Charlie Jones will work the Raiders' game 
in Seattle against the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, it's the Raiders' first game since Tuesday's announcement that 
it will be staying in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, who enjoys the spotlight as much as anyone, will have a captive 
audience for some pearls of wisdom about his former team. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has high hopes for Christensen, and this week he's been showing off some of 
his on-camera abilities while filling in for Roy Firestone on ESPN's 
"SportsLook." 
</P>
<P>
One thing about Christensen: He's not afraid to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
So, Todd, tell us, what did you think about the latest Raider news? 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, feigning a yawn, said: "I've really been on pins and needles. How 
long has this thing been going on, a couple of decades? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this is really startling. The best offer won out. Wow, shocking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a case of Oakland not being able to deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give credit to the owner. He really kept his poker face through 
all this." 
</P>
<P>
If Christensen sounds a bit cynical . . . well, he is. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years with the team, he was unceremoniously cut before last season. 
</P>
<P>
So, the former tight end is not real tight with his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's not an unusual story," Christensen said. "Few players get out when 
they should. Then they're cut and are bitter about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ill feelings might better describe Christensen's viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't harbor any great bitterness," he said. "I don't lie awake nights and 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
How's his relationship with owner Al Davis? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Christensen said. "There really is no relationship. We haven't 
talked. But there's no animosity, at least not on my part." 
</P>
<P>
And Christensen has positive things to say about the current team. 
</P>
<P>
"I do see things that indicate they're righting the ship," he said. "The 
defense, in particular, looks good, and I think the offense will come around." 
</P>
<P>
Then, breaking out in a laugh, he added: "How's that sound? Is that objective 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Christensen led the NFL in receiving with 95 catches for 1,153 yards 
and eight touchdowns. In 1988, his totals were 15 catches for 190 yards and no 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during the off-season, Christensen had his gall bladder removed and came 
into the 1989 training camp about 30 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
When the team cut down to a 60-man roster, Christensen was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew all along they were going to cut me," he said. "They could have let 
me know. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time they cut me, it was too late for me to try to catch on with 
another team, particularly since I was the highest-paid tight end in the league 
(at $750,000). 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted, after 10 seasons, five All-Pro seasons and two Super Bowls, was 
an opportunity to compete for my job. They never gave me that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The latest word on scrambling is that NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in a 
letter to Congressman Jim Bates of San Diego this week, said there will be no 
scrambling of TV signals this season. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said the league will look at various options for next season. "As you 
know, these are complex issues, technologically, legally and contractually," 
Tagliabue wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A reduced capacity at the Coliseum should mean more sellouts and televised 
Raider home games. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders' decision to stay in Los Angeles is not all good news for 
television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In the TV contract effective through 1993, there's an antiquated rule that 
limits networks to a single telecast in areas where an NFL game is being 
played. 
</P>
<P>
So Los Angeles, with either the Rams or Raiders usually at home, will continue 
to be deprived of network doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
With both the Rams and the Raiders on the road, CBS gets to bring in a 
doubleheader this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the Rams playing the Buccaneers at Tampa Bay at 10 a.m., with the 
announcing team of Brad Nessler and Dan Jiggetts. Nessler, a newcomer, has 
announced for the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m., the Washington Redskins will be at San Francisco against the 49ers, 
with Pat Summerall and John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
Bound to happen: ABC's Dan Dierdorf asked Monday night: "Is it possible for 
Jerry Rice to go an entire game without being a factor?" So, of course, a few 
plays later Rice's 20-yard reception set up San Francisco's game-winning field 
goal against the New Orleans Saints. Before that, he had one catch for six 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
New show: "Roggin's Heroes," starring Fred Roggin (who else?), is scheduled for 
syndication early next year. It will feature wacky footage from more than just 
sports, and there will also be guests each week. Already, several stations in 
major markets have bought the program and plan to show it on Saturday nights at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
It works out nicely Saturday that USC-Penn State will be on ABC at 12:30 p.m., 
then Stanford-UCLA on Prime Ticket at 3:30 p.m. . . . Two new GGP 
Sports-produced shows will make their debuts on Prime Ticket this weekend -- 
the pregame "College Football Today" Saturday at 3 p.m. and "College Football 
Review," with Saturday highlights, Sunday at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, unable to make deals with Prime Ticket and Channel 5, made a 
pretty good arrangement with Channel 13. The five-year contract, which goes 
into effect in 1991-92, starts at $90,000 per regular-season game and goes to 
$125,000 per regular-season game in the final year of the contract. The average 
is $112,703. That's not as much as the Lakers get from Channel 9, but pretty 
good. . . . The Clippers are still without a cable deal for next season. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA announced that "NBA Inside Stuff," produced by NBA Entertainment, will 
be carried by NBC on Saturday mornings during the season. Ahmad Rashad and 
newcomer Julie Moran will be the hosts. . . . The NFL has granted a five-year 
license to NTN Communications of Carlsbad, creators of the popular TV-football 
computer game QB1, which is played in conjunction with live football telecasts. 
Among those involved in the development of the game are Don Shula, Hank Stram, 
Bill Walsh and Don and Bob Klosterman. 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: The TNT telecast of last Sunday's New York Giants-Philadelphia 
Eagles game got a Turner Broadcasting-record rating of 7.3, meaning it was 
watched in 7.3% of TNT's 49 million homes. The previous high for TNT was a 6.8 
for a Chicago Bulls-Detroit Pistons NBA playoff game May 30. . . . Monday 
night's San Francisco-New Orleans game on ABC got a respectable 18.0 rating and 
32% share. 
</P>
<P>
Sanity check, please: Channel 4's Brett Lewis plans to don football togs and 
play tight end with the semi-pro Bandits Sunday for a feature story. . . . 
Attention, Ram fans: Eddie Doucette's "Rams Report" is broadcast weeknights 
following Jim Healy on KMPC, and the "John Robinson Show" is broadcast every 
Friday and Monday at 7:40 p.m. The Robinson show is also carried by KMPC's 
sister station, K-LITE (101.9 FM), on the same nights at 8:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Attention, rotisserie football players: FNN Sports has a new show, "Fantasy 
Football Weekly," which is televised every Saturday at 7:30 p.m. The hosts are 
George Siegal and Wayne Root. . . . Attention, horse racing fans: Del Mar has 
put out a 57-minute historical video, "Where the Turf Meets the Surf." It was 
produced by Joe Burnham, narrated by Pete Smith, with script by Jay Hovdey. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was incorrectly reported in Monday's editions that NBC's 
Will McDonough thinks Buddy Ryan is among several NFL coaches who won't be back 
next season. There is speculation that Ryan, who is in the final year of a 
five-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, might not be back, but 
McDonough doesn't agree. He said on "NFL Live" last Sunday that he believes 
Ryan will be re-signed sometime during the season.

CLOUDS CLEAR FOR PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
EVENTS: TV WEATHERMAN "DR. GEORGE" FISCHBECK WILL BE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE SIMI 
VALLEY DAYS TRADITION, SAVING THE DAY FOR PLANNERS.

<P>
The Simi Valley Days parade will have a grand marshal after all, organizers of 
the event said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Television weatherman George Fischbeck, also known as "Dr. George," has 
accepted the role, said festival chairman Andy Macek. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm honored to have been asked," said Fischbeck, of KABC-TV. "I've got a lot 
of friends out there, and I hope they will be watching." 
</P>
<P>
Fischbeck, 69, said he has served as grand marshal in parades before but cannot 
remember the cities they were in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall them," he said. "I've been in one or two out here in the last 
19 years. It's always nice to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
"We were very lucky to get him," said Tom Brown, special events coordinator for 
the parade. "He was very enthusiastic to help us out. And he promised clear 
weather." 
</P>
<P>
Some festival officials had worried earlier this week that they might be 
without a grand marshal for the Sept. 22 parade. 
</P>
<P>
Since they began their search for a grand marshal several weeks ago, festival 
officials were turned down by actress Sally Struthers, comedian Tim Conway, 
weatherman Fritz Coleman and a number of Los Angeles disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Claude Akins and another television weatherman, Christopher Nance, were 
also among the candidates being considered. 
</P>
<P>
Macek said many of the people who were asked about serving as grand marshal 
were unable to commit to the parade because of conflicting schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Macek, who earlier in the week said "we'll take anybody," admitted that the 
comment had caused him some trouble with other festival officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I took some heat for that statement," Macek said. "But everything worked out." 
</P>
<P>
He said after reports were published about the organizers' troubles in finding 
a grand marshal, KABC officials called and offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
"It wound up perfect for us," Macek said. 
</P>
<P>
The parade, which will feature more than 170 entries, including high school 
marching bands and floats, will begin at 9 a.m. and run west along Los Angeles 
Avenue between Erringer and Sinaloa roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley Days festival kicks off Saturday with a chili cook-off at the 
Simi Valley Drive-In, a barn dance at Strathearn Historical Park and a horse 
show at the Simi Arroyo Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual event -- which will also feature a carnival, a rodeo and a 
tractor-trailer pulling contest -- runs through Sept. 23. A related golf 
tournament is scheduled Sept. 28 at Simi Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the events will take place on a 70-acre plot at the corner of Madera 
Road and Los Angeles Avenue.

UNHEALTHY AIR AGAIN BLANKETS SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A thick, milky smog that crept in from the Los Angeles area continued to hang 
over eastern Ventura County on Thursday, causing officials to declare the air 
in Simi Valley "unhealthful" for the third time this week. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year the air has been unhealthy -- or in violation of federal 
standards -- 13 times in the county. Eight of those violations have occurred in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The air is so thick -- it looks like you could cut it with a knife," said Pam 
Campeau, assistant executive director of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But while the residents of Simi Valley choked through the haze, the air was 
listed as good Thursday in coastal areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not bad around here," Herman Ragsdale, an air quality specialist with the 
county Air Pollution Control District, said of the air in the Ventura area. 
"Normally a sea breeze blows everything out." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the air quality standards exceeded federal regulations 46 times in 
Ventura County, with most of the violations occurring in the eastern part of 
the county and in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the smog blows up from Oxnard and Camarillo and settles between the 
eastern hills. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the wind blows the smog from the San Fernando Valley into the 
eastern county. On Thursday, Piru barely missed violating air-quality 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"This has certainly been one of the worst days of the year," Ragsdale said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley also registered unhealthful air on Sunday and Wednesday. The air 
exceeded federal health standards in Piru and Thousand Oaks on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But relief is in sight, said Kent Field, a meteorologist with the county Air 
Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Low fog is expected to move in from the ocean today, pushing the smog out of 
the eastern portion of the county area, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Simi Valley resident was not taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been inside all day, and I think this is where I'm going to stay," Summer 
O'Neill, an 18-year-old clerk at the 7-Eleven store on Yosemite Street, said 
Thursday. "The air looks almost blue-gray. It's gross."

200 SEABEES IN MIDEAST, 1,600 MORE TO FOLLOW; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: FAMILIES OF THE PORT HUENEME-BASED SERVICEMEN ARE USED TO LONG 
SEPARATIONS. MOST SAY ONLY THE DESTINATION IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

<P>
About 200 Seabees based at the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme have arrived in Saudi Arabia and the remaining 1,600 who have received 
orders for Mideast duty will be there soon, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Those not yet in the Mideast will be airlifted there after their construction 
equipment arrives, Lt. Cmdr. James L. Gustafson said. Some of the equipment was 
sent from Port Hueneme and some from Puerto Rico, where one of the Port 
Hueneme-based battalions was deployed when the Persian Gulf crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Gustafson said, 1,200 tons of equipment have been shipped by sea 
and 500 tons by air. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not disclose specific missions, but said the Navy Seabees 
typically build facilities for Marines. All of the Seabees ordered to the gulf 
are men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Conlee, director of the base's Family Service Center, said the agency 
has set up a Mideast Information Center with pamphlets on 15 countries in the 
region. Seabee families are used to having their fathers and husbands overseas, 
she said, but the Persian Gulf is not a typical assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Support groups for wives and children also have been established, she said, but 
so far there has not been much demand. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are always deployed overseas," said Mike Coster, another Family 
Service Center official, noting that the Port Hueneme Seabees are routinely 
sent to Guam, Puerto Rico, Spain and elsewhere, typically for seven months at a 
time. "This is not new to Seabee wives. Just the location is new." 
</P>
<P>
One problem with the Saudi Arabian deployment is a lack of phone connections. 
All communication between servicemen and their families has to be by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Moore's husband, Tommy, returned from Puerto Rico only last May and will 
soon be leaving for Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Military wives are behind their husbands," said Elaine Moore, a volunteer 
ombudsman for other Navy wives. "We realized when they joined the service that 
they have a job to do and we back them 100%." 
</P>
<P>
She realizes that he may be in danger, she said, but "you can't think about 
those things. You cross that bridge when you come to it." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who keeps in touch with dozens of Navy wives, said it is tough when a 
husband goes to sea, but it can be rocky when they return too. 
</P>
<P>
"While they're gone, the wife does it all," she said. "Then they get home and 
say, 'OK, hand the checkbook over.' "

COUNTY SEEKS PLANS FOR DENNISON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dennison Park near Ojai will remain closed while county officials decide how to 
develop the rustic campground so more people will use it. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Parks Division closed the 34-acre park on Labor Day after 
the operators, Larry and Carolie Jensen of Ojai, declined to renew their 
two-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mutual decision," Carolie Jensen said. "We want them to put it out to 
bid for a long-term lease. It's hard to get funding with a short-term lease. 
The banks just laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Oshita, county parks manager, said officials are seeking someone who will 
invest in the park and will request 30-year proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth keeping it open the way it is now," he said. "There's no level 
sites for RVs and nothing to keep the kids busy." 
</P>
<P>
The once popular park at the summit of Dennison Grade five miles east of Ojai 
is bisected by California 150, which, along with a limited water supply, has 
hindered development of its eastern portion. 
</P>
<P>
The western half has 31 campsites, 20 picnic sites, group barbecue areas, a 
playground and a caretaker's residence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the county awarded $2,000 in prizes to students from three Southern 
California universities who drew plans for retreat centers, amphitheaters and 
other improvements. Oshita said some of those suggestions will go into the new 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Closed for four years, the park reopened in May, 1989, after the Jensens and 
former Ojai City Councilman Frank McDevitt spent considerable time 
rehabilitating the well and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The park is named after Henry J. Dennison, the first public schoolteacher in 
Ojai Valley, whose four sons donated part of their large cattle ranch to the 
county in 1924 on condition that it remain a public park. THIA BELL

CAR-POOL GROUP REACHES OUT TO ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>

<P>
A first-of-its-kind campaign is being mounted to increase ride-sharing by 
commuters from the housing-rich but job-poor Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter Computer, a nonprofit agency that is Los Angeles County's major 
ride-sharing proponent, said Thursday that it will open a branch office in the 
area, post signs along the Antelope Valley Freeway and urge residents and local 
employers to cooperate. The campaign will include a new telephone number for 
Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley residents to obtain ride-sharing information, 
(805) 255-RIDE. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the north Los Angeles County area is unique in the county. You've 
got a very large residential population, many of whom have very long commutes 
to work," said Carol Redfern, regional manager for the private agency that is 
supported by state and county funds. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the localized campaign is to encourage residents to use 
van-pools, car-pools and express bus service. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, a Commuter Computer executive, Al Rangel, has been assigned 
to work exclusively in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, Redfern said. 
Rangel will work out of city offices in Palmdale, which will become Commuter 
Computer's first satellite operation in the county. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Los Angeles County that Commuter Computer has mounted 
such an effort with the financial backing of local cities, Redfern said. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale City Council agreed Thursday night to provide office space and to 
contribute $15,650 toward the program. Santa Clarita officials last month 
agreed to provide the same amount, Redfern said. Similar funding requests will 
soon be considered by Lancaster and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Redfern said Commuter Computer chose to focus on the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys because of their large commuter populations. Both have far more 
residents than job opportunities, forcing an estimated 44% of their work force 
to commute elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter Computer laid the groundwork for its Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley 
campaign in May with a monthlong ride-sharing promotion that included newspaper 
and radio ads, 10 billboards, and ride-sharing brochures mailed to 25,000 area 
residents with follow-up phone calls made to about 11,000 residents.

PLANE CRASHES ON STREET, INJURING PILOT, PASSENGER; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENTS: A CRAFT RETURNING FROM LAS VEGAS NOSE-DIVES ONTO TRUMAN STREET IN 
SAN FERNANDO WHILE MAKING AN EMERGENCY APPROACH TO WHITEMAN AIRPORT.

A light plane making an emergency approach to Whiteman Airport in Pacoima hit 
power lines and crashed onto a San Fernando street Wednesday night, seriously 
injuring the pilot and his passenger and disrupting power to nearly 3,000 
residents, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-seat Cessna 152 crashed eight minutes after pilot Anthony Ast, 31, 
radioed the Burbank Airport tower to report a loss of engine power, said Wayne 
Pollack, air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said the plane appeared to have nose-dived onto Truman Street -- at 
Wolfskill Street -- after striking a group of 4,000-volt power lines about 
11:10 p.m. Firefighters had to cut through the wreckage to free Ast and 
passenger Petra Yearwood, 32, according to a Los Angeles City Fire Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was returning to Whiteman from Las Vegas, where the couple had gone 
on a pleasure trip, Pollack said. No one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity was disrupted for about 30 seconds to 2,000 San Fernando residents 
after the crash, and 854 customers were without power for slightly more than 
two hours, said Rosalie Gnam, area manager for the Southern California Edison 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ast underwent surgery Thursday morning at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills and was listed in stable condition with a broken ankle and cuts, hospital 
spokeswoman Maggie Cessar said. Yearwood suffered a broken spine and ankle and 
multiple cuts, Cessar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ast is a resident of Simi Valley, according to his pilot's certificate. 
Officials had not determined Yearwood's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on a stretch of road lined by small businesses and light 
industry, about two miles northwest of Whiteman Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said it would be several months before safety inspectors determine the 
cause of the crash. He said that a preliminary review of the wreckage showed 
that there was very little fuel in the wing tanks, but it had not been 
determined if the plane had run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had taken off from McCarren International Airport in Las Vegas at 
8:15 p.m., Pollack said. He said Ast holds a commercial pilot's license and is 
a certified flight instructor and aircraft mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said the registered operator of the aircraft is Sunquest Aviation, 
which rents planes at Whiteman Airport.

L.A. AGREES TO REDUCE DUMP'S GAS EMISSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: MILLIONS WILL BE SPENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE LANDFILL INTO 
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AIR QUALITY LAWS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
The city of Los Angeles has agreed to spend millions of dollars on measures 
demanded by regional air quality officials to reduce methane gas emissions from 
the Lopez Canyon dump in the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it was announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The city still faces civil fines for violating state air quality laws at the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott R. Sernel, an attorney for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, said an agreement, hammered out over the past few days, is expected 
to bring the landfill into compliance with state laws governing methane gas 
emissions by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Substantial conditions are being imposed on the city" that will solve both the 
gas emissions and odor problems at the dump, Sernel told members of the AQMD 
hearing board, which has been holding hearings on the dump's gas emissions. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, the district's enforcement staff cited the city for violating air 
pollution laws 28 times from April through July, exposing the city to fines of 
up to $25,000 a day, a total of $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The exact amount of the fine is still being negotiated and will be included in 
a separate civil agreement to be presented to the City Council on Tuesday, 
Sernel said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the amount of the fine is not expected to be high, because 
the agreement announced Thursday already commits the city to spend "several 
million dollars" to install new gas collection wells and flares and to seal 
cracks in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Sernel and Assistant City Atty. Christopher M. Westhoff, representing the city 
Bureau of Sanitation, asked the five-member hearing board to approve the 
agreement today after hearing public comment on the document. 
</P>
<P>
Both attorneys asked the board to discontinue hearings it is conducting into 
noxious gas emissions and other problems at the landfill -- a proposal that met 
with immediate opposition from hearing board members, elected officials and the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm skeptical that what we're going to see is going to be an acceptable 
document," said board member Mark Abramowitz, adding that he is opposed to 
ending the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this document to stop these proceedings before the full story is 
told," said Kagel Canyon resident Rob Zapple, who has led the fight by 
neighborhood activists to close the dump. The AQMD enforcement staff has not 
testified yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who in April called for the hearing board 
to close the landfill until it complied with state law, accused AQMD and city 
attorneys of trying to rush an "insulting and outrageous" agreement through the 
hearing board. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the rush to go to the City Council on Tuesday?" he asked, accusing the 
enforcement staff of "ignoring their own hearing board." 
</P>
<P>
Both Katz and Zapple argued that the proposed agreement allows inadequate time 
for public input. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not wait a week?," Katz asked. "If the deal is in the public interest, 
then it will stand up to public scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of work has gone into this document," Westhoff said. "I think it does 
address all the concerns brought out in these hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Coy, AQMD assistant director of enforcement, said the agreement calls for 
"extensive and detailed surface monitoring" of the landfill and details what 
steps the city must take to expand the gas collection system. 
</P>
<P>
The district will maintain "a tight grip on enforcement" on a continuing basis, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the escape into the atmosphere of methane and other gases given off 
by garbage rotting underground. By state and district law, the city is obliged 
to control the emissions by channeling the gas into underground collection 
pipes to the surface, where it is burned. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already spent about $4 million on an emissions control system, 
which the city has conceded is not working adequately. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the agreement announced Thursday requires the city to 
install a gas collection system in the initial disposal area of the landfill, 
expand its existing flaring and gas filtration, install additional perimeter 
probes on the landfill, conduct air monitoring in the community and maintain 
gas monitoring equipment in good working condition. 
</P>
<P>
It also sets dates by which the city must complete each condition of the 
agreement and requires the city to install an additional gas collection system 
if a proposed expansion of the dump is approved by the City Council.

SEPULVEDA SEPARATISTS CLAMOR FOR NEW IDENTITY; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITIES: HOMEOWNERS SEEK TO SECEDE FROM WHAT THEY SEE AS A HIGH-CRIME EAST 
SIDE. THEY WANT THEIR AREA TO BE KNOWN AS NORTH HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some Sepulveda homeowners want to secede and rename their neighborhood west of 
the San Diego Freeway "North Hills" to disassociate it from what they call the 
crime-plagued neighborhood to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the secession campaign argue that the San Diego Freeway forms a 
natural dividing line between two very distinct communities, and so the areas 
should bear different names. 
</P>
<P>
West of the freeway, the separatists say, Sepulveda consists almost exclusively 
of single-family dwellings, but east of the freeway the streets are lined with 
apartment buildings, condominiums and high-density business developments. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents of Sepulveda's east side charge that the secession 
movement's leaders have mischaracterized their home. 
</P>
<P>
Val Rowsey, an opponent of the secession who has lived in east Sepulveda for 33 
years, said much of the territory -- like the area that would make up the 
proposed North Hills -- consists of single-family dwellings, many much larger 
and more expensive than the average home west of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Only along Sepulveda Boulevard are apartment buildings and condominiums the 
norm, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rowsey called the secession drive a plot by real estate brokers and developers 
to lower property values in east Sepulveda so that they can buy inexpensive 
houses there, which they will tear down to make way for new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ribons, a real estate broker who has participated in a petition drive 
to bring the name change before the Los Angeles City Council, denied that the 
goal of the movement was to affect property values. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with community pride," he said. "People are sick and tired of 
being associated with three blocks east of the freeway that the city can't get 
a handle on, with prostitution, and streets that have been shut down." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
which patrols the area, said statistics comparing crime in the two areas were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
But some Sepulveda neighborhoods east of the freeway have been plagued with 
crime problems, including prostitution and drive-by drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in an effort to crack down on drive-by drug deals, police erected 
traffic barricades in the streets of two neighborhoods in east Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that our area is better; we are saying that there are two 
distinct neighborhoods," Ribons said. 
</P>
<P>
Most west Sepulveda residents, he said, do not identify with the area across 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1,300 people -- more than one-third of the 3,500 that Ribons 
estimates are needed to bring the issue to a vote by the City Council -- have 
signed the petition in favor of secession. 
</P>
<P>
"It may seem on the surface that we are trying to disassociate ourselves from 
the problems," but residents of the proposed North Hills may actually be more 
eager to help clean up the area once they rally behind the new name, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get an identity," he said. "We haven't been successful in 
voicing our views because there hasn't been community pride." 
</P>
<P>
But Rowsey said the entire community would be better served if it stuck 
together and tried to improve the small area that gives the territory a bad 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very snobbish move," she said. "We are going to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a group of Canoga Park residents, concerned that the area's name was 
lowering their property values and raising insurance rates, seceded to form the 
community of West Hills. The bitter struggle over the issue pitted neighbor 
against neighbor and caused major political problems for Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, the area's representative, who supported the move.

HERMOSA BEACH BOARD TENTATIVELY OKS PLAN FOR SCHOOL UNIFICATION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TRUSTEES WANTED TO KEEP THEIR ONE-SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT A STRAW VOTE 
INDICATES THEY ARE NOW WILLING TO MERGE WITH MANHATTAN BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hermosa Beach school trustees, who have held out for months against a plan to 
reorganize the beach cities' schools, said Wednesday that they have abandoned 
hopes of holding onto their little one-school district and are willing to merge 
with Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In a non-binding straw vote, four of the five Hermosa Beach City School 
District trustees said that, as a first choice, they would like Hermosa Valley 
School to join a single consolidated district that covers the three beach 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
As a second choice, the trustees said they would be willing to join Manhattan 
Beach and Redondo Beach trustees in backing the so-called "split unification" 
plan, which would create two unified districts, one for Redondo Beach and one 
for Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Formal action on the unification issue isn't scheduled until the school board's 
Oct. 10 meeting, when the votes could change. Trustee Joe Mark abstained from 
the vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But if the board members uphold their straw vote, voters in the beach cities 
will be asked, perhaps as soon as 1992, to dissolve the Hermosa Beach and South 
Bay Union high school districts and reorganize into two new 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, each city has its own grade-school district, while the high school 
district encompasses the three cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came to the realization that we have to act now," Trustee Greg Kelsey 
said. "We'll lose leverage if the others unify without us, and we'd like to go 
ahead in a cooperative fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Added trustee Lynne Gonzales: "We need the added resources and classes we'll be 
able to offer (under a merged Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach district). We 
wouldn't have to send or special education kids out to other districts for 
their classes. We wouldn't have to contract out for speech (therapy). In a 
larger district, you just can get more resources, because with more students 
you can get more money." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, reorganization has been discussed as a way to improve 
efficiency. Each of the four districts has closed schools in recent years 
because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently, school officials have been divided on how to reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
The high school district, which encompasses Redondo Union, Mira Costa and 
Pacific Shores schools, initially favored a single consolidated district. But 
after a consultant recommended the two-district approach in May, the high 
school trustees vowed to support any plan the elementary school districts could 
agree on. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach trustees, meanwhile, want to merge their elementary schools with 
Redondo Union High School. For the last year, they have circulated petitions to 
begin their own, independent unification process. Manhattan Beach also supports 
the two-district idea. 
</P>
<P>
But when the four districts met this summer in a joint session on unification, 
consensus was postponed at the request of the Hermosa Beach trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Wary of losing local control of their school, the trustees and several parents 
said they feared that they would be swallowed up if their district joined the 
much larger Manhattan Beach system. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who wanted to maintain the Hermosa Beach district said they would 
rather see the city raise taxes to continue funding its own school system or 
enact a parcel tax that would assess property owners a fee earmarked for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
These and other funding sources, they suggested, would cover the cost of 
maintaining Hermosa Beach's kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school and paying 
tuition for Hermosa Beach students who would have to be bused to high schools 
in other districts. 
</P>
<P>
But support for a parcel tax failed to materialize. And by Wednesday, when the 
board was to decide whether to put an advisory question about unification to 
the voters at a special election, the trustees had lost the will to delay 
matters any longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to move on, and we need a decision," board President Mary Lou 
Weiss said. "The straw vote was to get an idea where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
Only Mark was unwilling to reveal his position Wednesday, saying he preferred 
to have board members publicly outline their reasons for supporting unification 
at the Oct. 10 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees cautioned that their support for split unification is not 
unconditional. They plan to discuss it at length Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Weiss said, the board will want assurances that Hermosa Beach will 
be fairly represented on any new Hermosa-Manhattan school board. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is maintaining a high enrollment at Manhattan Beach's Mira 
Costa High School, because much school funding is based on enrollment. About 
500 North Redondo Beach students who attend Mira Costa would go to the larger 
Redondo Union High School in their city. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Manhattan Beach trustee Barbara Dunsmoor said she was not 
surprised by the outcome of the tentative vote in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to respond to their community," Dunsmoor said, "but I think we all 
knew down deep in our souls that split unification is the way to go."

REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY BOOSTS PAY FOR FIRM RUNNING TROUBLED HOTEL 
</P>

<P>
The Oxnard Redevelopment Agency will more than double the amount a consulting 
firm can earn for managing property and relocating residents of the Lemon Tree 
Hotel, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency decided recently to increase the pay limit from $86,100 to $192,100 
for Mecky Myers and Associates of Redondo Beach because the job turned out to 
be more involved than expected, according to agency reports. 
</P>
<P>
The motel was used primarily as housing for about 150 tenants. It was 
overcrowded and some of the 45 small rooms held as many as eight people. Myers 
is in charge of helping the residents find affordable housing before the city 
can demolish the hotel to make way for public parking. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mecky Myers and Associates originally were hired to provide an 
on-site resident manager at the motel. But "due to the nature of the Lemon Tree 
Hotel, two full-time on-site resident managers have resided at the hotel since 
the agency took possession," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the mecca of crime in the city," said Senior Crime Analyst David Keith 
of the Oxnard Police Department. "It's the No. 1 address in the city as far as 
crime is concerned. Homicide, robbery, burglary, theft, sexual assault, 
narcotics-related crime: You name it, it's happened there." 
</P>
<P>
The city condemned the building two months ago, and owner Bertha Ochoa will 
receive $795,000 for the 25-year-old hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa could not be reached for comment.

WEEKENDER: SAN PEDRO IS HOPING ITS STREET FAIRE WILL PUT THE COMMUNITY ON THE 
MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It happens too often. "So many people call and say, 'Where is San Pedro," said 
Dorothy Gordon of the San Pedro Revitalization Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But after Saturday's San Pedro Street Faire, the nonprofit firm and other 
sponsors of the sprawling outdoor community party are hoping that several 
thousand more people will no longer ask that question. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Pedro downtown has been revitalized several times over," said fair 
coordinator Jerry Gaines. He calls the sixth annual fair a "showcase for the 
downtown that has turned itself around. There's a lot of pride here." 
</P>
<P>
There also will be a lot of fun, whether it's running a scenic mini-marathon, 
enjoying varied entertainers, ogling the offerings of artists and merchants in 
170 multicolored street booths, eating international foods or touring old Ft. 
MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very festive, very community, with lots of children and happy people," 
said Bill Manuel, president of the San Pedro Downtown Business Assn., another 
fair sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Festivities will center on 6th Street between Pacific Avenue and Harbor 
Boulevard, where the normal daily traffic will be replaced by booths with 
striped awnings. 
</P>
<P>
Peppertree Plaza, at 6th and Harbor next to the San Pedro Municipal Building, 
will be the site of the main entertainment stage, where bands and solo artists 
will hold forth between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Opening ceremonies also will be held 
there at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But hours before that, more than 1,000 runners and walkers will take to the 
streets under the sponsorship of the San Pedro &amp; Peninsula YMCA, which is 
raising funds for youth fitness programs. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th running of the Y's Harbor Light Half Marathon will send runners around 
a scenic 13.1-mile loop taking in downtown San Pedro, Ports O' Call, Point 
Fermin Lighthouse, the bluffs along Vista del Mar and Royal Palms Beach. The 
race begins on 7th Street between Centre and Mesa streets at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
And a seven-mile walk also will held for people who want to enjoy the scenery 
in a less strenuous way. It begins at the same time and place as the half 
marathon. Fees are $18 for both events. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the marathon, the Y will sponsor a Kid K for youngsters under 12 
that starts at 8 a.m. at 6th and Harbor. The fee is $5. Parents must accompany 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
At the fair, people strolling among the 6th Street booths will find clothing, 
handmade crafts, paintings and other fine arts, plants and flowers -- even 
handwriting analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Roving sketch artists and photographers will be on hand to do portraits. There 
also will be a display of 1950s cars. 
</P>
<P>
The International Food Court on Centre will feature specialties from 11 San 
Pedro restaurants, along with food that 11 community organizations will sell to 
raise funds. The bill of fare includes Italian, Mexican, Caribbean Creole, 
Chinese and Thai food. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the fair will have a special Kids Court, located on Mesa, 
featuring pony rides, games and an air bounce where youngsters jump up and down 
in an air-filled enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Rubio Triplets, who sing and play guitar, will be among entertainers at 
the fair, which will have a smaller stage at 6th and Mesa in addition to the 
main stage at Peppertree Plaza. Other attractions include '50s nostalgia and 
surf music, a reggae band, a fusion of Latin, jazz and rock music, gymnastic 
and aerobic dancing, and Yugoslavian and Mexican folk groups. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, a mini-van will leave from 6th and Pacific to take people 
on free tours of Ft. MacArthur. Now used for military housing, the fort was a 
major U.S. Army induction and training center during World War II. Visitors 
Saturday will see the old parade ground and a collection of military artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking will be available for fair-goers at Port of Los Angeles Berth 87, 
1st Street and Harbor, and at city parking lots on 7th and 5th streets between 
Pacific and Mesa. Paid parking is available at the multilevel parking structure 
at 5th and Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Free shuttles will circle the fair area, taking people to and from parking 
lots. Tourist trolleys will take people around Ports O' Call and the harbor 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The first San Pedro fair was held six years ago when downtown revitalization 
had yet to take off. Artist Stephanie Seitz, who has had a booth in every fair, 
remembers that downtown "was virtually a ghost town" six years ago and that the 
fair was more like a garage sale than a festival. "People had spots on the 
pavement. There were no canopies or tables," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, San Pedro has gained new hotels, restaurants, buildings and 
businesses. And organizers say the fair -- which receives financial support 
from the city of Los Angeles, local institutions and businesses -- has grown in 
size and attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinator Gaines said the backbone of the fair is the volunteers who spend 
weeks organizing the event, work on fair day and clean everything up when it's 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gaines: "When we walk down on Saturday, visit the folks strolling and see 
that everyone is having a summery experience, our goals have been met." 
</P>
<P>
What: San Pedro Street Faire. 
</P>
<P>
When: Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:30 a.m., YMCA Harbor Light Half Marathon 
and Walk; 8 a.m., Kid-K. 
</P>
<P>
Where: 6th Street, between Pacific Avenue and Harbor Boulevard, San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Admission: Free

TRAUMA TEAM REACTS TO WOUNDED TODDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Debra Stafford, a new resident at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center, said she was surprised when she answered the trauma team call to the 
emergency room and discovered that the patient with a gunshot wound was a 
toddler. 
</P>
<P>
"This child was so young," said Stafford, 24, who is fresh from Brown 
University Medical School and was among the physicians who treated 2-year-old 
Jonathon Fabian of Lynwood. "He was so scared. He just cried the whole time for 
his mother." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Kennedy, a trauma surgeon who is in his seventh year of post-medical 
school training, is beyond surprise, but not beyond anger. "These are 
completely, completely innocent people . . . and they can't defend themselves," 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving at King in April, Kennedy said he has treated a dozen children 
14 and under for gunshot wounds, including two 14-year-old girls last weekend. 
One of them died of a bullet wound in the heart. Gunshot victims at King are 
noticeably younger than Kennedy saw in his six years of surgical residency at 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon, is the youngest gunshot victim in the staff's recent memory, though 
there have been younger victims of stray gang bullets in the city. Jonathon was 
shot as he played outside his Platt Avenue home Tuesday evening. He has since 
undergone exploratory abdominal surgery and was in stable condition, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet did not penetrate the abdominal cavity and doctors said the toddler 
is expected to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The King medical center, just south of Watts, sees more trauma patients than 
most hospitals. In fact, there are so many victims with gunshot wounds that 
Army surgeons are now being trained there. 
</P>
<P>
As the victims increasingly are younger, the job of the physicians who must 
deal with their injuries becomes increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
These doctors say they feel shock and anger but must remain dispassionate. 
</P>
<P>
Imani Williams, a physician's assistant in the surgery department, said the 
hospital's pediatric ward is probably like no other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," she said. "If you go up to the pediatric ward a lot of the 
patients are shooting victims." 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the heat of trauma treatment, team members concentrate on their 
much-practiced drill, though they say they never get used to the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get caught up in, 'That's a poor little baby' " Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she recalls one preschool victim of a gang-related shooting, a 
4-year-old girl, who survived her injuries. Both the girl's parents were active 
gang members, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, trauma team members do not know -- or care -- if the 
bleeding bodies they are laboring to save belong to innocent bystanders, or 
not-so-innocent gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way," Kennedy said. "No one deserves to be shot and get 
killed . . . even if they are a gangster." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question some of the guys we fix up go out and shoot people . . . 
but a small percentage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy remembered once asking a wounded youth, "What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager said he was shot by police because he didn't obey their command. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said he was feeling sympathetic until further inquiry revealed that 
the unheeded command was, "Drop your weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Though all the wounded get the same treatment in the trauma room, that does not 
mean doctors are blind to the realities of gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he had two known gang members with bullet wounds in the same room 
when he was doing his residency at County-USC. The doctor inquired about the 
pair's gang affiliation to prevent mayhem on the ward had the two belonged to 
warring groups. 
</P>
<P>
The two roommates were totally different, he said. One was timid and sheepish. 
The other was the center of attention with frequent visits from his "homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like he was a hero," said Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The "hero" didn't make it to his post-hospital visit. Kennedy said he got a 
call from the boy's mother saying he had been shot again and was in the 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual to see gunshot victims back for the second time, or in the 
case of one man, six times. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy explained that the doctors at King place a priority on making sure 
bullets are removed from gunshot victims -- so they can quickly tell next time 
if the bullet that turns up on an X-ray is new or from a previous gunshot 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford, the newest member of the trauma team, had never treated a gunshot 
wound until about three months ago. At King, she will get more than her share. 
She judges her own reaction to her job by the cases she shares with her family 
-- usually the patients who die and the ones who are young. Stafford said she 
told them about Jonathon Fabian.

ELIZABETH (BETTY) LORETTA GRACE; ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth (Betty) Loretta Grace, a longtime Northridge resident who enjoyed 
watercolor painting, has died in Northridge. She was 69. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Grace died Wednesday of a heart attack, said her son, Jeff Grace. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Elizabeth Ardetich on Feb. 17, 1921, in Buffalo, N.Y. In 1967, she 
moved to California and settled in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, she attended Pasadena City College and an art studio in Van 
Nuys, where she learned watercolor painting. Mrs. Grace, who enjoyed painting 
landscapes, portraits and old houses, was a member of the Valley Watercolor 
Society, the San Fernando Valley Art Club and West Valley Artists' Assn. She 
was a member of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Northridge and sang in the choir. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her husband of 42 years, Chester Grace; a son, Jeff Grace of 
Northridge; a daughter, Norine Rathbone of Visalia; and a brother, Steven 
Ardetich of Tonawanda, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Visitation is scheduled tonight from 5 to 9 and on Saturday and Sunday from 
noon to 4 p.m. at Bastian &amp; Perrott Mortuary, 18728 Parthenia St. in 
Northridge, which is handling the arrangements. The rosary will be recited at 7 
p.m. Sunday at the mortuary. A funeral Mass is to be celebrated at 9 a.m.

SURF'S UP AT BENEFIT FOR GROUP AIDING SANTA MONICA BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not canvas, not clay, the medium was the surfboard, and the message was: Heal 
the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 artists, including Lita Albuquerque, Peter Max, William Wegman, 
Laddie John Dill and Joni Mitchell, were asked to create original works on 
surfboards to benefit the nonprofit group, dedicated to saving Santa Monica 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's opening, surfboards of every description -- luminous, 
ominous, sensual, whimsical, wheeled and even crucified -- leaned or hung on 
the walls of Santa Monica's James Corcoran Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
It was an extraordinary quiver, as wave-riders call a collection of boards, and 
it drew more than 500 visitors, 65 of whom paid $50 for a chance to win one of 
the more or less functional art objects. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many Westside openings, it was like a movie -- a movie with a lousy 
plot but a really great cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Justine here?" someone asked, alluding to actress and environmentalist 
Justine Bateman. Justine wasn't there, but actor Raul Julia was, touring the 
exhibit with artist friend Muramasa Kudo, whose board features a beautiful 
swimmer, an octopus and an exhortation, in Japanese calligraphy, to clean up 
the seas. Julia is concerned about the oceans, he said, though he has never 
actually climbed atop a surfboard and ridden a wave. "Water skiing is as close 
as I ever got." 
</P>
<P>
With his splendid head of blond hair, actor and former child evangelist Marjoe 
Gortner drew almost as many stares as the startling board by Tim Smith labeled 
"Jesus Christ, Surfer Star." 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like a lion tamer," one woman whispered as Gortner circled the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers, artists, activists and people who were some of each converged at the 
opening, unified by their alarm over the worsening quality of Southern 
California beaches, the ones the whole world dreams about. 
</P>
<P>
Long after most Westside infants had been tucked in, a few toured the gallery, 
riding a parental hip. 
</P>
<P>
"What are these children doing up?" an observer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Art babies," another explained. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a worthy cause," said actor Michael Nouri, who contributed a 
board inspired by a Masai warrior's shield. "When I can't go swimming after 
it's rained, in a body of water that is so beautiful, there's something wrong. 
It's a microcosm of what's going on all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Russ Tamblyn and wife Bonnie both contributed to the show. 
</P>
<P>
She is an illustrator, and her board was a tribute to her late mother, a 
painter. In a poignant bit of recycling, Bonnie Tamblyn used her mother's 
paints to depict the goddess Gaia embracing the earth. "I got to journey again 
with my Mom," she said of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A star of David Lynch's TV phenomenon "Twin Peaks," Russ Tamblyn said he had 
begun painting in earnest in 1964. Until then, he said, "I was too busy 
dancing." Tamblyn said he was influenced by artists George Herms (another 
contributor) and the late Wallace Berman, who worked in the early '60s in 
Topanga Canyon. "I had been a Sunday painter before that. After that, every day 
became Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Like the boys and girls on the beach in their Bodygloves, the artists could opt 
for various shapes for their boards. Tamblyn chose a symmetrical board, on 
which he repeated an image of an old man in a boat nursing a white-winged bird. 
He had seen the basic board in a book. When he discovered it was called a Lynch 
double-ender, he decided "it's definitely the one for me." 
</P>
<P>
Observer Peter McAlevey mused about the significance of the show. This wasn't 
just another gathering of the pretty people, sipping gourmet water and free 
vodka and pretending to be fascinated by the work on the walls. McAlevey, a 
30-something vice president for production with Stonebridge Entertainment, said 
surfing is one of the ruling metaphors of our times. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfing is to our generation what the West or the frontier or outer space was 
to an earlier generation. It's emblematic of the better world that could 
exist."

SUMMER BREAK FROM FREEDOM FIGHTING; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: A STUDENT LEADER OF THE CZECH REVOLT BINGES ON ORANGES AND GARAGE 
SALES IN LOS ANGELES BUT LOOKS FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO PRAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
At 6-foot-6, Jan Bubenik could see above the crowd surging into a narrow street 
flanked on both sides by Czech police and knew what was about to befall them -- 
and him. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed arms rose and fell as white nightsticks turned bright red from the 
bloody heads of student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik, a 22-year-old medical student at Charles University in Prague, was an 
organizer of the event last fall commemorating the 50th anniversary of a 
demonstration that resulted in the Nazis closing the country's universities. 
</P>
<P>
Word of it was spread by cryptic signs posted around the capital city, 
picturing a crown of barbed wire. "Bring a candle and a flower to Wenceslaus 
Square at 5 p.m. on Nov. 17, 1989," was the only message. 
</P>
<P>
The rest, as they say, is history, and Bubenik has earned a place in it as one 
of a triumvirate of student leaders of the successful revolution. He 
subsequently was the youngest member elected to the new Czech Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling those heady but frightening days, Bubenik likens them to leaping into 
an abyss. He said he had no idea if a handful people or a hundred would show up 
that night. Or that the turnout of tens of thousands would spark the overthrow 
of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have no clue," he said, using an Americanism he picked up in Los 
Angeles this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik has been here for eight weeks, attending the UCLA Extension American 
Language Center, an intensive program during which students from around the 
world learn English. He will return to Prague later this month for the fall 
term at medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Living in the Southland has been like another world for Bubenik, who, with 
sun-bleached hair and sunglasses hanging around his neck, looks like a typical 
California college kid. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent the summer picking oranges off a back-yard tree; he has seen 
"Rocky Horror Picture Show" and become a big garage sale fan. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik also quickly picked up the essential ingredient of L.A. living. "In Los 
Angeles, everybody who does not have a car is an absolute dead person," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik has socialized with Henry Kissinger and been a guest of Ivana Trump on 
earlier visits to the United States, traveling with his country's president, 
Vaclav Havel, when he spoke to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He has savored more fresh fruit and vegetables in one summer than he thought 
imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the bountiful life in America is not his favorite topic. The struggle for 
freedom is. When he speaks of the revolution and his country's release from a 
totalitarian regime, his eyes light up, and the words tumble out. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik is clearly a hero of the story, though he doesn't tell it that way. 
Instead, he talks of his fear and ambivalence on the night when the press of 
the crowd and the police was so strong that the dorm-room key in his back 
pocket gouged his flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Only a backpack full of clean laundry he had picked up on the way to the march 
protected him from more serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik said he had only one thought at the time: "to get out of this 
massacre." 
</P>
<P>
When he made it back to the dorm, he and his roommate had a drink and decided 
revolution was not for them. But by morning, they had reconsidered and began 
going door to door telling fellow medical students that the official government 
version of the march -- that a few hooligans caused a problem -- was not true. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the student strike was called, with Bubenik standing on the 
stage of the National Theater representing the medical students and reading a 
proclamation. An orchestra played the Czech national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody cried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial problem was communication with the populace, and that is where the 
student network came in, Bubenik said. 
</P>
<P>
Video recorders are a rare commodity in his homeland, but each department of 
the medical school had one. They were rounded up, and students spent a day 
making copies of a tape of the demonstration and the brutal response by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik said he took to the road showing groups what had really happened at the 
protest. One such meeting became a moment of truth for Bubenik when a Communist 
Party leader showed up unannounced to dispute Bubenik's account. 
</P>
<P>
Looking around the room, Bubenik saw heads bowed as those at the meeting tried 
to hide their identity from the official. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can imagine how deep was the fear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Bubenik said he had to decide whether to be careful like the 
others or remain on the front lines. Thereafter, he vowed, he would try to be 
so busy that he would have no time to be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
His credo became "Nobody should be afraid again." 
</P>
<P>
"This idea helped me very much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik's decision to become an activist was not unprecedented in his family. 
His father lost his university professorship in the 1968 Czech uprising when he 
protested the treatment of his colleagues and has worked as a railroad laborer 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest and, he quickly notes, the shortest of three brothers in a family 
of athletes, Bubenik plays basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly this summer he played unofficial Czech ambassador with a dizzying 
schedule of meetings, speeches and social events. Everyone in the Los Angeles 
Czech community wanted to meet him, as did other groups interested in a 
first-hand account of his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik has lived with Linda and Sherman Mickell in Brentwood this summer. When 
Linda Mickell thought he wasn't having enough fun, she sent him to La Jolla to 
party with the Mickells' daughter and her fiance, a Navy pilot, and their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Mickell said she has been impressed by Bubenik's ability to "come out of 
darkness" into a society like this and not have his head turned or become 
complacent with the special privileges that have been accorded him. 
</P>
<P>
To his English teacher, Tara Neuwirth, "The main thing is that he's an 
incredibly nice person, naturally charming and with no artifice at all." 
</P>
<P>
Besides learning English this summer, Bubenik had a difficult decision to make: 
whether to relinquish his seat in Parliament to concentrate on medical school 
or devote himself full time to politics. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of his sponsor, friend and occasional translator, Mia Valert, he 
has decided to concentrate on his education, while staying involved in the 
Civic Forum Party and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bubenik explains that, at his age, "it's necessary to work very hard on myself 
now."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: 'NUNSENSE' BEGINS TO TURN THE TIDE 
TOWARDS A PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of three local for-profit theater companies this summer seemed to 
indicate that for-profit ventures were an idea whose time has come in San 
Diego. But the fate of two of the companies that saw their expectations rise 
and their resources fall with their shows -- "The All-Night Strut" and "I 
Wanna-Be!?" -- served as a reminder that commercial ventures are always a 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
Still, James A. Strait, who launched the third company, T.S. Productions, with 
a for-profit production of the off-Broadway hit, "Nunsense," is showing that it 
can be done. 
</P>
<P>
When Strait and partner Paul D. Taylor first opened the production July 20 at 
the Sixth Avenue Playhouse, Strait expressed the hope that he would pay back 
his investors by the end of summer and begin paying profits in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
But the secret of his success to date has been that he didn't count on such 
lofty predictions. He kept his overhead so low that he only needed to sell 70 
tickets a night to break even. 
</P>
<P>
Sales dipped below the break-even point a couple of times, which necessitated 
additional loans from Strait and Taylor to the production. 
</P>
<P>
But now his patience and that of his investors' are finally starting to pay 
off. Not with profit checks -- yet. But the first checks returning some of the 
initial investment costs were sent out last week. 
</P>
<P>
Those checks are small, he acknowledges -- a mere $440 to be split among eight 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, just the idea of giving something back was kind of fun," Strait said. 
</P>
<P>
The company spent just more than $71,000 for mounting and running costs. 
Investors put up $32,500 of that, and the show, as of Aug. 26, has brought in 
just over $39,000 in net ticket sales for a total of $71,500 -- leaving about 
$440 to be returned to the investors. 
</P>
<P>
Also working in Strait's favor was his decision to spread the investment risk 
among several people, keeping each individual's risk relatively small. The 
largest single investment in "Nunsense" was $5,000 -- a modest amount in 
contrast with that of mounting "The All-Night Strut" and "I Wanna-Be!?," each 
of which depended on the backing of just one or two investors. In both cases, 
those investors, faced with disappointing reviews and poor ticket sales, closed 
the shows ahead of schedule. "Nunsense," a loony, lighthearted comedy about six 
nuns staging a talent show to raise money to bury some of the members of their 
order, is set to run through the end of September, but Strait would like 
nothing better than for audience support to justify indefinite extensions and, 
ultimately, profits for all. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly he would like the show to run at least long enough to validate his 
investment in an upcoming casting change. 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Allen, the San Diego actress who played the exploding head in Arnold 
Schwarzenegger movie "Total Recall," will replace Dianne Holly as the Mother 
Superior on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Holly, who is on the faculty at San Diego State University, has to return to 
her teaching and designing duties. The longtime Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company 
costume designer will doff her "Nunsense" habit to design costumes for the 
upcoming SDSU production of "Candide." 
</P>
<P>
"I Wanna-Be!?," a musical look at the life of modern wannabes, who want to be 
things they are not, may try another run at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre 
Company, said one of the show's creators, Judy Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
Milstein, director of Underground at the Lyceum, is negotiating with Kit 
Goldman, producing director of the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company, for another 
staging of "I Wanna-Be!?" on dark nights at the Gaslamp's smaller house, the 
Elizabeth North Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Details are still being worked out as to whether the show will be a rental or a 
cooperative venture, in which the Gaslamp will share part of the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which had committed itself to a four-week run at the Hahn, closed 
after nine days when the principal investors dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
The new production, which might take place this year, may be structured in such 
a way to compensate the Gaslamp for the rental revenue that was not paid when 
the show closed. One possibility being bandied about is offering the show free 
to Gaslamp subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the project and want to work with them," said Goldman. "I think our 
subscribers might enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Larry Mendte, the Channel 8 weatherman-funnyman, is set to make 
his San Diego acting debut tonight in "The KPUG Talk Radio Broadcast" at the

David Henry Hwang's Broadway hit, "M. Butterfly," which starts its national 
tour next week in Boston, will probably head to San Diego in 1991, said a 
representative of the show's New York office. The show, starring Philip Anglim 
of "The Elephant Man" as the British diplomat and A. Mapa as the mysterious 
Oriental lover he calls his Madame Butterfly, will go to Los Angeles as part of 
the Los Angeles Playgoers series in December. San Diego dates are being 
discussed, but have not yet been firmed up, the representative said.

CALIFORNIA BALLET SCALES BACK BUT TRIES SOMETHING NEW

California Ballet's season of grass-roots dance will be less ambitious than 
usual this year because of budget constraints, but the troupe will try 
something new by sponsoring the Tokyo Festival Ballet during the 1990-91 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-member ensemble is formed by participants of Japan's International 
Ballet Competition, and the March 23, season-concluding performance at the San 
Diego Civic Theatre will be by some of Japan's most prominent choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
The season gets under way this Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., when the 
California Ballet returns to the alfresco ambience of Sea World's Nautilus 
Amphitheater to introduce four new repertory pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the ballet will dust off its annual Christmas confection, "The 
Nutcracker," for a double run. This year, the familiar East County Performing 
Arts Center will be replaced by a weekend run at the Poway Center for the 
Performing Arts, with performances scheduled for Dec. 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
The full-blown "Nutcracker" spectacle, complete with live orchestra, will 
return to the Civic Theatre on Dec. 14-23. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to leave ECPAC because they gave our dates away to the college," said 
ballet director Maxine Mahon. (The center is under the auspices of Grossmont 
College). 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that we're cutting back on our season ticket" package, Mahon said, 
"but there will still be as many performances as usual. We have the dancers 
doing 30 weeks, and we'll have lecture demos and college performances 
throughout the year." EILEEN SONDAK

24 HOURS AT THE OPEN FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
TALENT: A JOURNEY TO 16 PROGRAMS SHOWS THE BROAD ARRAY OF ART AVAILABLE.

<P>
Choosing among the events at the Open Festival is not an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
After all, organizers of the two-week festival didn't. Their mandate was to 
include any self-proclaimed artist, performer or group that wanted to sign up, 
and more than 600 did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three of the events at the two week-festival, which ends Sunday, are 
scheduled for the San Fernando Valley, including singers, belly-dancers, the 
art of Glendale, 10-year-old violinists, environmental theater, the art of 
Osaka, women photographers, hula dancing and improvisational theater. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to skip the choosing, too. The only true way to get a feeling for 
the festival was, we figured, to pack as many of the events as possible into 24 
hours. By juggling schedules and not seeing all of any one performance, it was 
possible to squeeze in 16 events beginning last Saturday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Our Valley cultural odyssey took us over 160 miles of freeways and side streets 
to venues ranging from basketball courts to living rooms. The offerings ranged 
from the sublime to the offensive, with the one commonality being the heat -- 
almost every event, even those at night, was played against the background whir 
of fans and/or air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the events felt like family affairs, with relatives and close friends 
of performers comprising most of the audience. At nearly every performance, at 
least one person stood in the back, recording a home video with a portable 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
5 p.m. Saturday: It might have been just a humble basketball court, but to 
those willing to make the leap of faith, the recreation hall of the North 
Weddington Recreation Center in North Hollywood was for that day a South Seas 
village. Outside, bare-chested men in flowered sarongs were barbecuing while 
inside there was dancing. A lot of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
On the program for "Rhythms of Polynesia" were 40 dance demonstrations by the 
Valley-based Fantasi Dancers, including the "Samoan Slap Dance," "Cock-Eyed 
Mayor" and "I Am Hawaii" numbers. 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the court a few little girls tried to imitate the 
dancers, and a woman at a food stand sold "Polynesian Polish Dogs." "They're 
hot dogs that have been marinated," she explained with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
7:30 p.m.: Three girls -- ages 10, 10 and 11 -- sat in the front of a small 
audience at the McGroarty Art Center in Tujunga, playing a flute-violin-cello 
arrangement of the theme from Brahm's Symphony No. 1. They played slowly, with 
great seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
They played the second number of the program, sponsored by the Meremblum youth 
orchestra organization, with equal solemnity even though it was a suite of 
songs from "Fiddler on the Roof." The audience applauded wildly and at the end 
the three girls broke into delighted giggles. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys were awesome," said one of the musicians while waiting to go on as 
the trio filed back to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was "Remembrance," a short Charles Ives piece for four instruments 
based on a text that begins, "A sound of a distant horn . . . " As the young 
musicians were setting up, a woman in the audience motioned toward a boy 
carrying a French horn and quietly told the man next to her, "That's my son, 
the distant horn." 
</P>
<P>
8:15 p.m.: The small house on Simpson Street in North Hollywood used to be a 
horse stable. Then it was a family's house, then a children's arts center and 
now it's an adult arts center. On this night workshop students who meet at the 
center gave a performance that included dance, poetry and music. 
</P>
<P>
It was, like many Open Festival programs, a mixture of styles. A woman sang 
"The Man I Love," two women did a sultry jazz dance and a young woman elegantly 
attired in a black dress and pearls played a violin solo. 
</P>
<P>
The living room of the house was so packed for the performance that several 
people sat on folding chairs on the lawn under an unusually starry sky, 
watching through a picture window. 
</P>
<P>
9 p.m.: Theater East, the venerable Valley theater atop a bowling alley in 
Studio City, put on "Dead End at Sunset," an original adaptation of Maxim 
Gorky's classic "The Lower Depths." The adaptation was so original that it 
moved the drama from Russia to a seedy apartment complex in Hollywood, circa 
1932, where a group of downtrodden dreamers resided. 
</P>
<P>
The large cast moved through the play with vigor, so much so that at the end of 
a scene actor John Hugo, charged with murder in the play, is dragged off stage 
and the heel of his boot becomes loose. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucky thing you're in jail, now," Jack Breschard, one of the producers, told 
Hugo backstage as the actor tried to fix the boot. 
</P>
<P>
10:30 p.m.: A group calling itself the Los Angeles Festival Improv frantically 
ran through a retinue of theater games at the Wild Side Theater in North 
Hollywood. Audience members were called upon every few minutes to yell out 
suggestions and luckily nearly all were willing to participate repeatedly. The 
audience numbered 12. 
</P>
<P>
11 a.m. Sunday: One floor down from The Art Store, an arts supply store in 
Studio City, is a small, simple art gallery. For the Open Festival it was 
filled with paintings and sculptures by the Kobo Art Ensemble, a group of 
Japanese, American and European artists who work in Osaka, Japan, with graphic 
artist Kobo Ishikawa. 
</P>
<P>
"We all use kind of a mixture of Japanese and European styles," said Philip 
Bossant, a strapping, blond painter who left L.A. two years ago to work and 
study in Japan. He supports his art endeavors there by teaching English. 
</P>
<P>
Bossant and exhibit curator Lauren Peterson pointed toward a painting of a 
flower done in broad, red brush strokes by artist Toshiaki Yamada. Called 
"Fevered Flower," it's a tribute to Van Gogh's sunflowers. "It's because the 
Japanese word for 'cough' sounds like 'Gogh,' " explained Peterson as the 
artist, who speaks no English, stood by. " 'Cough' led to 'fever' and that led 
to the idea of the painting." 
</P>
<P>
11:30 a.m.: The Glendale Art Assn. set up an exhibit of paintings by its 
members in a storefront in the Glendale Fashion Center. The mall was nearly 
deserted on a Sunday morning and the exhibit was not easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the beautiful banner they gave us," said one of the art association 
members in the storefront to a visitor as she unfurled an official festival 
banners. "We couldn't put it up by the street because of the sign law in 
Glendale. It's such a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Out front, at a table in the shade of a tree on the mall, sat Violet McGee, 85. 
She was patiently painting a flower still-life from a picture she had. "I'm 
here to show people the way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noon: There may have not been many people at the Glendale mall, but compared 
with the Woodbury University campus in Burbank, the mall was Grand Central 
Station. The campus was deserted, but signs pointed the way to the Women in 
Photography exhibit at a gallery that doubles as a boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if the exhibit was closed, but the door was unlocked and as it was 
pulled open the lights were suddenly switched on by a hidden sensor. The 
exhibit, which featured the work of seven photographers, could be viewed in 
uncommon quiet. 
</P>
<P>
1 p.m.: The Valley Cities Jewish Community Center in Van Nuys was host for 
Center Members Create, an art show of pieces by members of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the art was not in a style usually associated with Jewish artists. 
There were, for example, several bonsai trees on display and there were two 
large, colorful quilts by a group called the Hamish Amish Quilters (the "The 
Joy of Yiddish" defines a hamish person as one who is "unpretentious, cozy and 
warm."). 
</P>
<P>
One of the quilts was a tribute to American women, with panels celebrating the 
achievements of Gertrude Stein, Margaret Mead, Eleanor Roosevelt, Maya Angelou 
and several others. "It's only our second quilt," said a proud Ellie Sazer, one 
of the Hamish Amish. 
</P>
<P>
2 p.m.: "What Is Man Without the Beasts" was an "ecological musical revue," as 
the program called it, with a message. 
</P>
<P>
The show, staged at the Richard Basehart Playhouse in Woodland Hills by the 
Planet Players Theater Company, began with a dance that was created for the 
Harmonic Convergence in 1987. Then a tall, long-haired man in tight jeans came 
on stage to lecture the audience about how the Indians had kept the land pure 
until the Europeans arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In the background the air conditioner could be heard going full tilt. 
</P>
<P>
2:40 p.m.: On the sincerity scale, members of the "Unlock Your Voice and Sing" 
workshops at Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys got high marks. Facing the 
audience packed into a cottage, they took their turns at the microphone and 
sang their hearts out. The audience cheered them on as if it was a revival 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Marcie Howard, who said she blends "psychology, metaphysics and voice 
training" in her workshops, called all her current students up to the stage at 
the end to sing a final number. At least half the audience answered her call. 
</P>
<P>
3:15 p.m.: The Perfumes of Araby dance company began its short but lively 
performance with a procession through the crowd outside Everywoman's Village. 
The exotically clad dancers then headed for a shaded area where they did most 
of their choreographed program of belly-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
4:30 p.m.: Four actresses performed one-woman shows in the Collage of Women's 
Movements, a program about the struggles of women at several points in history. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Marsh, who portrays union organizer Mary Harris Jones (best known as 
Mother Jones) in her monologue, played to tough conditions in front of the 
Creative Arts Center of the George Izay Park in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, children laughed and cried as they played, cars with radios blaring 
pulled into the adjacent parking lot, a family set up a picnic at a nearby 
table and audience members adjusted their chairs periodically to try to stay in 
the shade of a tree near where Marsh performed. 
</P>
<P>
The audience numbered 17, including other cast members and a man with a 
camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
As the time neared 5 p.m., Marsh finished her impassioned program with three 
short statements. She looked out on the small audience, smiled and said, 
"Freedom is your choice. This is your country. God bless you."

WANT REAL GRUB? SIT A SPELL AT SKOBY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chatsworth is about as much like Wyoming as any place gets, this side of the 
Santa Monica Mountains. Horses strut about in white-fenced corrals. The 
foothills look close enough to touch. 
</P>
<P>
Walk into a local hangout in this town, Skoby's Country Inn, and what do you 
see? Families, natch, here for the family-style food, and also a few 
leather-skinned roughnecks who look as if they've been out taming stallions all 
day. In general, these guys favor the bar, where they can drink giant mugs of 
beer and swap stories about their exploits. But when they get hungry, Katie, 
bar the door -- they get hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Skoby's is the right place for them. It's a rugged-looking roadhouse with a bar 
full of black Naugahyde booths at one end and a sweet, rustic dining room at 
the other. The dining room has turn-of-the-century ceiling fans, glass-topped 
tables and beams sticking through a slanted roof. Call it mom-and-pop 
deconstructionism, and don't bother any of the boys in the bar with one of 
these expressions. They're just here for the grub. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Food comes in trencherman portions that look almost intimidating if 
you aren't an endurance rider. Take the stuffed mushroom appetizer: jumbo 
mushrooms the size of a Little Leaguer's baseball cap. The kitchen heaps them 
with fresh ricotta cheese or good, crumbly homemade sausage. They come four to 
an order, and must weigh six ounces apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the chicken liver pate, a monstrous scoop surrounded by lettuce, 
tomato and black olives. I don't endorse this one; it's food-processor-mushy 
and distinctive only for its sheer bulk. The onion rings, garlic toast and 
fried zucchini sticks served here are kindred spirits to the pate, oversized 
and underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
The house specialty at Skoby's is country-style pan-fried chicken, golden brown 
and four pieces to the order. Pan-fried chicken has a different character 
altogether from deep-fried; it's denser, crisper, and when done skillfully, far 
less oily. Skoby's chicken is dense, crisp, and so forth, but the superlatives 
end there; it just doesn't taste like a whole lot. The chicken itself is a 
little tired, and whatever it is dredged with could use more zip. 
</P>
<P>
But it's still an impressive dinner, all told, and at a very low price ($9.95) 
to boot. The accompaniments are all terrific. First you get a creamy cabbage 
soup and a basket of moist, flaky squares of corn bread, and then with the 
chicken come great mashed potatoes, peppery black-eyed peas and a viscous 
country gravy that could encase a mobster's feet on his way to the bottom of 
the river. If they would liven up the chicken just a bit, the dinner would be a 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of things here are already knockouts. The unctuous homemade meat loaf, 
wrapped in brown paper before baking, is the rival of any meat loaf on the 
Westside. And the stuffed pork chop with corn bread stuffing is the best I've 
tasted in this area, an honest dish with an honest farmhouse appeal. 
</P>
<P>
There's much more to the menu than these dishes: several broiled fish -- sea 
bass, shark and sole to name a few -- and a whole list of specialties such as 
chicken fried steak and a full slab of ribs. The ribs are so big that they 
stick out over both sides of the platter they are served on (too bad they're so 
overdone; the meat is so soft it literally falls apart when you bite into it). 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime you'll find good burgers, a meaty top sirloin sandwich and a fine 
club sandwich with crisp bacon on soft egg bread. Ask for some of the house 
barbecue beans with your sandwich. They are sensational, with hunks of bacon in 
every smoky bite. 
</P>
<P>
You can't get the pan-fried chicken at lunch, but there is a dish called 
chicken and pasta. I liked it better than the pan-fried chicken, actually. It's 
half a baked chicken with that good corn bread stuffing, served on a bed of 
buttered noodles and smothered with that same petroleum-jelly-thick country 
gravy. 
</P>
<P>
Have them put the gravy on the side, unless you're planning a long ride after 
lunch. Like to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: stuffed jumbo mushrooms with ricotta, $3.95; with sausage 
$4.95; home-made meat loaf, $9.95; stuffed pork chop (Wednesday only, after 5 
p.m.), $7.50; homemade cheese cake, $3.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Skoby's Country Inn, 20419 Devonshire St., Chatsworth; (818) 718-0433. Lunch 
from 11:30 a.m to 2:30 p.m. Monday to Friday; dinner from 5 to 9:30 p.m. daily.

SANCTIONS SEEN FAILING TO GAIN U.S. GULF GOALS; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: ANALYSTS FEAR TIME WILL WORK FOR IRAQ. A DEADLINE FOR LAUNCHING 
MILITARY ACTION IS URGED. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government analysts have told President Bush that economic and political 
sanctions alone will not achieve his goals in the Persian Gulf crisis, and he 
is under mounting pressure to wait no more than four to six weeks before using 
military force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies, convinced that sanctions ultimately will not 
work and fearing that time will begin working in Iraq's favor, are pressing the 
Bush Administration to launch a military attack by mid-October to drive Saddam 
Hussein's troops out of Kuwait and cripple his vast military machine, according 
to U.S. sources. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush himself has not shown publicly any sign that he is concerned that 
the sanctions are not working. In fact, on Tuesday he told Congress that Iraq 
"is feeling the heat," although he made clear the United States will take 
military action if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Government analysts agreed that sanctions are squeezing Hussein at the moment 
and will hurt him for some time to come. But ultimately, they said, sanctions 
alone "will not topple him." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi sources suggested Thursday that if sanctions show no signs of working 
within four weeks, the United States and its allies with troops stationed in 
Saudi Arabia would consider resorting to a military option. 
</P>
<P>
Already the allies are debating whether to supplement their naval blockade with 
an air blockade of flights carrying supplies to Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, 
the sources said. An air blockade, which the sources acknowledged would be 
potentially "very dangerous," could turn into a flash point for military 
hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. government official denied that there is any "timetable" for 
determining whether to resort to military force. He said a decision on that 
matter could come earlier or later than mid-October, depending upon the 
circumstances and whether Iraq has taken any provocative actions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things that could prove to be provocative before that time," said 
the official, who stressed that the rapprochement between Iraq and Iran has 
caused serious concern among Persian Gulf strategists. "I would keep my eye on 
Iraq and Iran," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior government official confirmed that the United States will 
consider a military option if it concludes the sanctions are not working but 
denied that there is any deadline or "magical date at the moment" for making 
that determination. He said a decision to abandon the sanctions or to stick 
with them for a longer period could come earlier or later than four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're constantly evaluating, and right now the sanctions are working," this 
official said. "If there was a situation where certain countries would announce 
they are not going to adhere to the sanctions and the sanctions are seen as not 
working, then we'd look at the options. No one wants to stick to sanctions 
unless we have confidence they're doing the trick." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether a deadline has been set, the Saudis as well as some U.S. 
analysts believe time will work against the United States and its allies and in 
favor of Hussein. The longer the military standoff continues, they argue, the 
greater the chance that the fragile coalition of Western and Arab allies 
aligned against Hussein will begin to come apart. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one high-level Saudi official predicted Thursday that some countries 
in the coalition will drop out as soon as any hostilities begin. He expressed 
the hope that the coalition could hold together at least until then. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to keep everybody, or as many people as possible, with us 
until D-Day minus two hours, probably, or two minutes," the official said. "We 
really would like to see this solved peacefully," he added. "But at the same 
time, even if we have intentions to go for military action, we must pursue all 
peaceful venues" in order to "maintain the unity." 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, Lt. Gen. Jimmy Adams, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for 
operations, suggested that Hussein could withstand the sanctions longer than 
the allied coalition could survive. 
</P>
<P>
"We can cause a lot of damage, but he can take a lot of pain," Adams said. "How 
long can we keep this fragile coalition together? He can survive an embargo for 
four or five months. Can we keep our unity that long?" 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said if an ultimate decision is made to launch a military 
strike against Iraq and Iraqi forces in Kuwait, the attack would be "fast and 
massive." 
</P>
<P>
"But I can assure you," he added, "there are a lot of brains being wracked now 
to do it right, proper, legal and convincingly after exhausting other options." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force officials in Saudi Arabia confirmed that within four weeks they 
will have enough forces in place to carry out a massive assault. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf already exceeds 145,000, 
including soldiers, Marines and Air Force personnel based on land and sailors 
and Marines in the gulf. There are three aircraft carriers in the gulf region 
and six wings of combat aircraft, made up of more than 400 planes, from Stealth 
fighters to B-52 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force commanders clearly are preparing for possible early combat action, 
and they have told reporters it would be advantageous to see action sooner 
rather than later if there is to be a war. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very close to being prepared to carry out a wide range of offensive 
missions," said Lt. Gen. Henry Viccellio Jr., the Air Force deputy chief of 
staff. "Our forces and people will be in place by the end of September. Then 
we'll be in a posture to do whatever we're asked to do." 
</P>
<P>
Talking to U.S. flight crews at the Riyadh Air Base, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, Air 
Force chief of staff, said, "When the time comes, do it right and it'll be a 
short tour." 
</P>
<P>
For now, with diplomacy still the order of the day, the Administration and its 
allies are encouraging as many emissaries as possible to go to Baghdad to try 
their hand at finding a peaceful way to end the crisis, officials say. In part, 
they note, the invitations are designed to ensure that if a military move 
comes, no country will be in a position to say that it could have averted a 
crisis if only it had been asked. 
</P>
<P>
So far, officials note, the diplomatic moves have been unavailing. Jordan's 
King Hussein, for example, was firmly rebuffed by Saddam Hussein during a 
recent trip to Baghdad. The Iraqi leader flatly said he would not withdraw from 
Kuwait, according to diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch is "depressed" as a result of the trip and has been 
uncharacteristically silent since returning to Amman, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
At least some senior Administration officials continue to say that they believe 
the sanctions can prevail and that a military move against Hussein would be too 
dangerous and too unpredictable in its outcome for the United States to 
deliberately follow that path. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush also has been receiving the opposite advice from Arab leaders, from 
Israel and from at least some of his own advisers, who present three basic 
arguments in favor of using force. 
</P>
<P>
The first argument is that sanctions ultimately will not be able to force Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows with precision how far down you can drive subsistence" in a 
society that is being placed on a war footing, said one senior U.S. analyst. 
Hussein may be able to exploit "all kinds of little leaks" in the sanctions and 
force his people to accept a lower standard of living long enough to outlast 
U.S. patience, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
The second argument is that over time, the U.S. position in the gulf will 
become far more difficult to sustain. Further, as the stay of American troops 
lengthens, frictions with the far different Saudi society are bound to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Saudi source said, there is little sign that such frictions have 
become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent (of the troops) are nowhere near" Saudi population centers, he 
said. But if the American military were to remain in the kingdom beyond the 
beginning of the New Year, at that point "time definitely is against us," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
A final argument is that even if Hussein ultimately were to withdraw peacefully 
from Kuwait, he would remain too much of a threat to the security of the region 
to be allowed to remain in power. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein with all his force intact and chemical capability and nuclear 
potential intact is the most menacing thing that could happen in the Middle 
East," the Saudi source said. 
</P>
<P>
If Hussein were to withdraw peacefully from Kuwait, those who would like to see 
Iraqi military power eliminated would face political difficulty in staging 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, Hussein has shown no signs of being that flexible, adding, "I 
just have not seen anything yet that convinces me that Saddam is willing or 
ready to extract himself and put us in a position to face that question. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation to ourselves, to our people, to go the peaceful route as 
much as we can, until everybody is convinced that this is not an option," the 
source added. "But then if military action has to be taken, this will be, or 
ought to be and could be, a short war."

HUNDREDS FLEE MORE CARNAGE IN SOUTH AFRICA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of black families abandoned hope for peace here Thursday after another 
night of carnage and quietly lugged their possessions out of the dusty squatter 
camp they call Phola Park, or "place of rest." 
</P>
<P>
Shopping carts and wheelbarrows piled high with belongings were guided down the 
bumpy paths past corpses left from the night before. Sooty sheets of corrugated 
metal from nearly 800 burned shacks groaned in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The attackers are coming back," said Lena Khumalo, 81, who balanced a large 
basket of dishes on her head. "We must leave now." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, as the death toll from a month of factional fighting in 
Johannesburg townships soared to more than 750, many South Africans worried 
that the country was on the brink of uncontrollable urban war. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest violence, the police said, at least 26 blacks were killed and 
more than 100 injured Thursday evening when six black youths shot and stabbed 
passengers on a crowded Johannesburg commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers leaped from windows of the moving train as the attackers opened 
fire, and victims were found along a stretch of three railway stations east of 
Johannesburg. The train was headed toward southeastern townships, including 
Tokoza and neighboring Katlehong. 
</P>
<P>
A motive for the attack was not known, but a police spokesman said it was 
thought to be related to the internecine war. Similar gang shootings of black 
commuters and pedestrians in Johannesburg earlier this week took three lives. 
</P>
<P>
The seams of black society appeared frayed almost beyond repair in Tokoza and 
other townships Thursday after another week of the fighting, which has pitted 
migrant Zulu workers in the Inkatha Freedom Party against non-Zulu residents 
supporting the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities cut power to Tokoza and Katlehong on Thursday in a dispute over a 
4-year-old rent boycott, and community activists said the move could exacerbate 
the already volatile situation. A freshly painted slogan on a Tokoza wall 
characterized the atmosphere. It said: "Viva Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
The peace process recently undertaken with such promise by the government and 
the ANC seemed particularly endangered by the bloodshed. And among Tokoza 
residents, confidence in the ability of the police or even black ANC leaders to 
stop the violence appears to have been eroded. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to attacks Tuesday and Wednesday nights in Phola Park spoke of 
heavily armed Zulu invaders in red headbands being assisted by a dozen or more 
white men the residents believe to have been police. 
</P>
<P>
Young ANC supporters said they needed weapons, not words of reconciliation, 
from leaders such as Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"They should arm the people and suspend the negotiation process," said Prince 
Mhlambi, 22. "How are we to protect ourselves?" 
</P>
<P>
Mhlambi spoke proudly of Phola Park's "strong defense committee," which he 
predicted "might also kill some police tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the ANC deputy president, told President Frederik W. de Klerk this 
week that his supporters' demand for weapons to defend themselves "will be 
difficult to resist" if the violence continues to escalate. The ANC announced 
Thursday that it has called an emergency meeting of the organization's national 
executive committee for next Tuesday to discuss the violence. 
</P>
<P>
ANC supporters have not been the only victims of the violence, however, and 
Inkatha leaders say their supporters are only defending themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Zulu migrant workers were hacked to death this week in Tembisa, and 
dozens of worker hostels, home to thousands of Zulus, have been attacked and 
gutted by fire in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours before the Zulus advanced on Phola Park on Wednesday, ANC 
supporters stopped a black taxi driver on a nearby road and posed questions in 
Zulu. The driver, not knowing whether the mob was Inkatha or ANC, answered in 
Zulu and was beaten to death as reporters watched. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the trouble. But the ANC also has 
blamed right-wing elements of the police, who the ANC says are trying to sow 
discord among blacks and undermine the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, hospital wards and refugee centers are overflowing. And the 
living quarters of black South Africans, already in desperately short supply, 
are steadily being destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The current wave of township violence began Aug. 13 in Phola Park, a 5-year-old 
squatter settlement on the edge of Tokoza. Its 35,000 residents have neither 
running water nor electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Although the residents come from various ethnic backgrounds, many are Xhosas, 
like Mandela, and that link with the ANC has made them a target of 
Inkatha-supporting Zulus. In the past month there have been six attacks on the 
squatter camp. About 350 shacks were burned down Tuesday night and 400 
Wednesday night. All but a few hundred of the inhabitants have fled.

<P>
Down a dingy alley in a crowded slum, Nenita Castillo and her four children 
share a tiny wooden house with 12 other people. The sofa is torn, the beams are 
rickety and garbage piles up outside. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, a mechanic in a Kuwaiti oil town for the last five years, has a 
new girlfriend and a new car there, she complains. He hasn't sent money home 
for five months. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult," she says bitterly. "We have no money." 
</P>
<P>
Several miles away, Florecita Renato needs only cabinets to finish her dream 
house, a solid, two-story structure with an airy veranda. There's a separate 
bedroom and bath for her mother, a new 20-inch color TV and a full-time 
housekeeper for her baby. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, also a mechanic for the same Kuwaiti company, wired his paychecks 
home each month for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
"We built the house with Kuwaiti dinars through and through," she says proudly. 
"That was the reason he went." 
</P>
<P>
The pain and the profit of millions of overseas workers and the families they 
leave behind is etched in sharp relief in the Philippines, one of a half dozen 
impoverished Asian nations from India to Indonesia whose workers are trapped in 
the Middle East conflict. The squalid refugee camps springing up in the Middle 
East have focused attention on such workers, who made up more than half 
Kuwait's population. But back home, their plight only overshadows deeper 
problems of chronic unemployment and social upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, more than 1,000 skilled and unskilled workers leave Manila to seek 
their fortunes abroad. Each year, the estimated 1.5 million Filipinos who nurse 
in the United States, clean homes in Hong Kong, pump oil in Saudi Arabia and 
sail ships around the world send an estimated $3 billion home. That makes them 
the nation's most lucrative export. 
</P>
<P>
"They go for greener pastures," said Francisco Pasion, head of the oldest and 
largest trade union for overseas Philippine workers. "They go because there are 
no jobs here." 
</P>
<P>
Many fulfill their dreams, sending salaries back to buy a house, educate 
children, start a business. But others, especially women, find a nightmare of 
broken contracts, physical abuse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 80,000 Philippine women, for example, work as "entertainers" in 
Japan. Many are recruited by Japanese Yakuza gangsters and wind up as 
prostitutes in dingy Tokyo nightclubs, officials here say. In June alone, four 
were murdered, two committed suicide and one was stabbed. Twenty-nine others 
sought refuge for being pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Problems are similar, if less severe, in other countries, according to 
Rosabella Khan, head of a government assistance program for overseas workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to discourage women leaving," she said. "So many go as governesses, or 
tutors or secretaries, and they end up as prostitutes. They become so 
destitute, they have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Khan points to filing cabinets filled with hundreds of reports of rape, 
beatings, nonpayment of salaries and abuse. Most are from the Middle East, home 
to about 700,000 Philippine workers and family members. The total is unknown 
since many stay illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"One girl came home from Saudi (Arabia) last month in a hood and long dress," 
Khan said. "I thought she was a Muslim. Then we found she'd been kicked and 
beaten and slapped by her employer. She was black and blue all over. We had to 
send her to three hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
That case may have been extreme, but nearly 800 cheated, stranded and destitute 
workers were repatriated in the first six months of this year. So many workers 
bring horror stories home that President Corazon Aquino temporarily banned the 
export of women as domestics in 1988. Today, an emergency aid booth at Manila 
airport and several crisis centers cater solely to returning migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many Philippine men complain they often are discriminated against overseas, 
given lower wages and worse housing than European counterparts. Ironically, 
they are partially victims of their own success. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ferdinand E. Marcos first exported workers to the Mideast in 
the mid-1970s to generate foreign exchange and ease unemployment at home. 
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries soon shipped millions of 
workers as well. Cut-throat competition for jobs has nearly halved salaries 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine engineers and doctors who used to earn $1,500 a month now draw $800, 
labor officials say. Carpenters and pipe fitters who had $500 paychecks now get 
$280. And unskilled laborers earn as little as $120, far less than before. 
</P>
<P>
There are also higher fees. Manila-based recruiting agencies that once charged 
only the employer now often demand $1,000 from the worker as well. That's five 
times the legal limit, and no guarantees are given. 
</P>
<P>
"Workers are forced to sign two sets of blank contracts," said labor leader 
Pasion. "One goes to the government, with the legal salary and fringe benefits. 
The other is for the job. . . . Then, when he arrives, he finds the contract 
was written in Arabic. So the terms and conditions are changed again." 
</P>
<P>
The social cost at home is also growing. While many couples survive years of 
separation, officials say at least one in three overseas families breaks up, 
further fracturing this staunch Roman Catholic society. Partially as a result, 
police say a majority of Manila's drug addicts are children of overseas 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a society of close-knit families," said Eduardo Bellido, a labor 
researcher. "Once a father or mother is away, the children are adrift. The 
moral fiber is eroded." 
</P>
<P>
There is another cost. About 70,000 Philippine nurses work in the United 
States. Recruiters visit nursing schools and hospitals, offering scholarships 
and jobs to lure away the best and the brightest. While they are a boon for 
America, the drain they represent has left a severe shortage in Philippine 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it unusual to find teachers, therapists, medical technicians and other 
college-educated women working as domestics, sharing lunch and letters from 
home each Sunday with thousands of other Philippine women in Hong Kong's Statue 
Square or Rome's Central Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Marianito Roque, resources manager for the overseas workers welfare 
administration, argues that the brain drain is matched by a "brain gain." He 
says the money the workers send home helps to educate family members. Whole 
villages in Cavite and Pangasinan provinces depend on remittances. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to the barrio, they're dreaming of overseas work," he added. "They 
see the wife of an overseas worker with a nice dress, a TV, a radio. And they 
have nothing. It induces more wives to encourage their husbands to go, too." 
</P>
<P>
Many regret it. Even before the Iraqi invasion, Christina Camposagrado, 30, 
hadn't gotten money from her husband in Kuwait for six months. Thin and 
hollow-cheeked, she waited at an overseas workers' aid center last week to 
apply for an emergency loan to feed her three children. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard he has another girl there," she said, starting to cry. 
</P>
<P>
Home on vacation, Leopoldo B. Digno, 41, said he and his wife broke up during 
his recent five-year stint in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"To live away from your family is very hard," he said sadly. 
</P>
<P>
And many find it difficult to readjust to life back home, where salaries are 
far lower. Ricardo Pisco, 36, worked nine years as a waiter in Saudi Arabia and 
Libya to support his wife, her family and his seven brothers and sisters back 
home. That's impossible in Manila, he says, so he's applying for another 
overseas job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no choice," he said with a shrug. "My money is finished." 
</P>
<P>
Such dramas of the diaspora are the daily stuff of Tagalog-language TV soap 
operas. And a long popular Manila radio call-in show, called "To Saudi With 
Love" until a recent name change to acknowledge other countries, lets the 
nation eavesdrop while husbands and wives pass news, quarrel and make up over 
long-distance lines. 
</P>
<P>
"They discuss finances, how to handle a son who is a drug addict, how to handle 
kids who are dropouts from school," said show host Rey Langit. "All their 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
One woman even phoned her husband in Saudi Arabia to announce on the air that 
their 3-year-old daughter, Cherry, had died. 
</P>
<P>
"The father shouted a terrible curse at the top of his voice," Langit recalled. 
"Then he cried and cried on the air. That was very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone likes it. Jose T. Almonte, a retired army general, said he was 
angry and ashamed when six nieces went abroad recently as domestics. He says 
the lure of the overseas job is distorting Philippine values. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling of shame on our part," he said. "A feeling we've failed our 
children. We've squandered their future. So they must leave to better their 
lives. And that's a tragedy."

U.S. EXPECTING SHORTAGES, PLANS TO TAP OIL RESERVES;

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is expecting worldwide oil shortages to hit as early as 
next month and is planning to tap the United States' strategic oil reserves for 
the first time, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis, Watkins told senators, 
private stocks of petroleum may be insufficient to cover an anticipated 
shortage of 2.5 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony was the first indication that the gulf crisis is about to be felt 
in the crucial area of oil supplies, despite increased oil production by Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, the Security Council late Thursday approved arrangements 
for the dispatch of food to Iraq and Kuwait, despite the U.N. blockade, in the 
case of urgent humanitarian need. The council said that distribution should be 
monitored by the United Nations and the Red Cross or similar bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The action cleared the way for an Indian ship to sail with provisions for 
thousands of Indians stranded in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House said that a videotape of a speech by President Bush 
to the people of Iraq was on its way to Baghdad, carried by government courier, 
after Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat refused to accept it when Deputy 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger attempted to present it to him at 
the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said later that accepting the tape would violate diplomatic 
protocol, but he added: "We are going to broadcast it on prime time." 
</P>
<P>
The speech has been described at the White House as an effort by Bush to 
explain the reasons for the deployment of more than 100,000 U.S. troops in 
Saudi Arabia and to tell them that the United States has no quarrel with the 
people of Iraq -- only with their leader, President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, who offered an array of voluntary initiatives to encourage fuel 
conservation and promote domestic oil production, told a Senate committee that 
a projected oil shortfall this month of nearly 4 million barrels a day could be 
covered by the large stocks of oil accumulated by private companies. But he 
warned that by next month those supplies might not cover the projected 
shortfall of 2.5 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to 
explain why the Administration had not already tapped the strategic reserve to 
hold down oil and gasoline prices, Watkins and his deputy, W. Henson Moore, 
said the reserve supply was intended to offset a major disruption in the flow 
of oil, rather than to manage prices. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve was established as a result of the energy crises of the 1970s, but 
the stockpile was not created until the mid-1980s. It can be tapped on the 
orders of the President, but it would take at least 16 days before the oil, 
stored in underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas, could begin flowing to 
commercial refineries. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a supply shortfall that would require us to go into the strategic 
reserve, it will hit in the fourth quarter," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's two most senior energy officials said any action Bush might take 
to begin using the reserves would be coordinated with the 22 nations in the 
International Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strategic reserve totals 590 million barrels. The House on Thursday 
unanimously adopted a measure expanding it to 1 billion barrels. The 
Administration had opposed the expansion, but Moore said that Bush is now 
almost certain to sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The other main reserves are held by West Germany and Japan, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States importing about 40% of its oil needs, the Administration 
is preparing programs to promote conservation, expand domestic oil production 
and encourage industries and utilities to use coal, natural gas or nuclear 
power. The programs are designed to save 1.1 million barrels of oil a day by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said amendments to the Clean Air 
Act that are being considered by Congress would reduce dependence on Mideast 
oil -- but not until the year year 2005. The amendments would result in greater 
use of fuels produced from natural gas and such agricultural products as corn 
to power motor vehicles, Reilly said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"This fuel switching will result in a minimum oil savings of 500,000 barrels a 
day," he said. "This compares with 750,000 barrels a day which we had been 
getting from Iraq and Kuwait before the invasion." 
</P>
<P>
Among the conservation and production-enhancing measures Watkins presented was 
a renewed request to open up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil 
exploration -- an effort that has been stalled since the Exxon Valdez oil spill 
in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The program also calls for: 
</P>
<P>
Speeding up government approval of natural gas pipeline projects and 
incinerators that burn garbage to produce energy; 
</P>
<P>
A presidential order directing federal agencies to buy more alternative-fuel 
cars and increase energy efficiency in government buildings; 
</P>
<P>
A national advertising campaign to encourage Americans to conserve oil by 
reducing electricity use, replacing inefficient furnaces and using lower-octane 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration sought to head off growing sentiment in Congress 
to punish Japan, and possibly West Germany, for what some in the House and 
Senate see as insufficient support for the U.S. military operation. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the House approved an amendment to the defense spending bill that 
would require the United States to pull 5,000 of troops from Japan each year if 
Tokyo fails to pay the costs of stationing U.S. forces there. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that measure, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We 
don't see any linkage between the situation with our forces in Japan and the 
situation in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
The White House also disputed as "ludicrous" the view that the U.S. ambassador 
to Iraq, April C. Glaspie, may have given Hussein the impression that Bush 
would look aside if Iraq invaded Kuwait, in a meeting she had with the Iraqi 
president one week before the invasion on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Thursday that, according to an Iraqi transcript of 
the meeting, Glaspie did not object to the Iraqi troop movements, building at 
that time toward the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
Glaspie, who left Baghdad on vacation one day before the invasion, is now 
stationed at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the airlift of 
Americans from Iraq and Kuwait is continuing. One planeload of 258 Americans 
arrived late Thursday afternoon in Raleigh, N.C., and he said two more jumbo 
jet flights were scheduled for today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 920 Americans have been flown out of the two countries, Boucher 
said, but about 1,550 remain trapped there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1976 out of concern that a 
cutoff in Mideast oil exports might threaten national security. It is designed 
to store excess crude oil for use by the armed forces and key industries in 
case of a shortage. The reserve, which currently contains 590 million barrels 
of oil and has a daily pumping capacity of 3.5 million barrels, is a complex of 
six water-filled salt domes on the Texas-Louisiana coast. Crude oil is pumped 
into the domes, displacing the water; the salt forms an impermeable layer that 
preserves the oil indefinitely. To retrieve the stores, seawater is pumped in, 
thus displacing the oil. However, before the reserve can be tapped, the 
President must declare a "severe" energy emergency. Japan, West Germany and 
Sweden maintain similar reserves.

<P>
Dianne Feinstein promised Thursday that if she is elected governor she will 
revive the dream of homeownership for young Californians. 
</P>
<P>
She also talked of building whole new towns along a proposed railroad line 
through the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein showed off some of the new housing built in pricey San Francisco for 
low-income families and first-time homeowners under programs inaugurated by her 
administration as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's time to bring that same energy, that same commitment, that same 
leadership to the state of California," the Democratic candidate for governor 
said in the auditorium at the new Delancey Street housing complex across from 
Pier 36 on San Francisco's Embarcadero. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein then visited the three-bedroom, 1,200-square-foot Parkview Commons 
townhouse bought by architect David Rulon for $140,000 even though the unit and 
others like it have been appraised for as much as $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under her administration, the city and a nonprofit development firm built 114 
townhouses that were offered for sale to first-time home buyers making $40,000 
or less a year. Rulon was one of 3,271 applicants who entered a lottery to buy 
the units, which were priced as low as $99,000. 
</P>
<P>
Until the chance to buy into Parkview came along, Rulon said, he and his wife 
had considered moving from the San Francisco Bay Area, perhaps to Seattle. 
"This was our one and only opportunity to buy something in the Bay Area," Rulon 
told reporters who toured the unit with the candidate and her entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said Parkview is just one of a variety of housing concepts that 
California needs so that less-affluent residents, seniors and others can afford 
to own their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a savings account," Feinstein said of home ownership. "There's 
nothing better and it's so hard for young families." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also said, in response to a question, that while she would propose 
some changes in Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting initiative approved in 
1978, she would not tamper with the Jarvis-Gann 1% property tax rate limit, 
calling it "inviolate." 
</P>
<P>
"People live in a fear that the property taxes, if they can't work, would 
become such that they would lose their homes," she said. "I think that's an 
extremely emotional issue. That's what brought on Proposition 13 in the first 
place. We must protect that rate for residential property taxpayers . . . who 
want their homes for their family housing and they deserve to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said California had suffered under eight years of Republican neglect 
of the housing issue. She said that only 10% of $600 million worth of 
voter-approved housing bonds have been spent. 
</P>
<P>
"It will become an immediate priority of mine to see that those funds are 
turned into housing units as quickly as possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also said that voter approval of highway and rail construction funds 
in June offers the opportunity for the sort of innovation she said is needed to 
avoid traffic congestion, end long commutes by workers who cannot afford to 
live near their workplaces, and to manage California's growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to begin that rail spine down California, to begin some new 
towns and do it right with jobs close to housing and use some innovative 
methodology to build some new homes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein, Wednesday and Thursday provided the most sustained public 
campaigning she had done in her home city since her primary election victory 
June 5. She hugged old friends and associates arriving at Delancey Street on 
one of those sunny, wind-swept days for which the city is famous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to be home," she said, and remarked about the smog and traffic 
congestion in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of Parkview Commons was the San Francisco school board's decision 
back in the 1970s to abandon a high school building because of earthquake 
hazards. The city put up $2.5 million to lease the site from the school 
district for 75 years and paid $1 million to demolish the old school buildings. 
The use of tax-exempt bonds financed mortgage funds at fixed below-market 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The start-up city funds came from the city's Office of Affordable Housing 
Production Program, which received $30 million from downtown office building 
developers as part of what Feinstein said was "an obligation to help provide 
affordable housing" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said the city built an estimated $500 million worth of affordable 
housing under such programs during the first seven years of her administration 
or "nearly half of all housing developments in San Francisco during those 
years." 
</P>
<P>
"It's innovation that builds housing today," she said.

PANEL TOUGHENS STANDARD ON SMOG ALERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a day when Southern California was reeling from its worst smog of the 
season, the state Air Resources Board in Sacramento lowered the threshold at 
which smog alerts are called. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision Thursday is expected to dramatically increase the number 
of smog alerts and is aimed at providing earlier warnings of climbing air 
pollution levels to sensitive individuals, including young children and adults 
who exercise heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased number of health warnings does not mean smog is getting worse, 
but that it causes health problems for some people at levels lower than we 
previously believed," ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless said. "Those people will 
benefit from an earlier warning." 
</P>
<P>
The board's action coincides with the worst smog siege of the season in the 
South Coast Air Basin. A yellow-brown pall hung over large portions of the 
four-county basin Thursday, obscuring the San Gabriel Mountains and office 
towers in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A sergeant at the Los Angeles Police Academy, located in Elysian Park 
overlooking downtown, said he was unable to spot buildings only a few miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty damn bad, and smells bad," Sgt. Sam Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the new threshold been in effect Thursday, first-stage alerts -- called 
when the air is considered "very unhealthful" -- would have been triggered 
throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the alerts were limited to two areas in portions of the 
Riverside-San Bernardino area. 
</P>
<P>
Had the lower threshold been in effect during the last three years, the ARB 
estimates, an average of 127 health warnings a year would have been called in 
Los Angeles County instead of 67, 29 instead of 7 in Orange County, 83 instead 
of 20 in Riverside, 119 instead of 51 in San Bernardino and 19 instead of 1 in 
San Diego. For the first time, alerts also would have been called in Ventura 
County and southern Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
Smog alerts are issued when pollution levels exceed federal health standards. A 
first-stage alert, while serious, is the least severe of three health 
advisories on smog and is the only one affected by the ARB revision. According 
to the new standards, a first-stage smog alert will be called when ozone 
concentrations hit 0.15 parts per million parts of air over a one-hour period. 
Currently, a first-stage alert is called when concentrations reach 0.20 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Regional air pollution districts throughout the state have until next summer to 
implement the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the recent onslaught of heavy smog, officials of the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District were unrepentant about their prediction 
last month that the 1990 smog season would be among the mildest on record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably among the worst days of the year, but this has been such a good 
year that Thursday's pollution is like a little peak in the valley," AQMD 
spokesman Tom Eichhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials took pains to point out that the cloud of pollutants so visible 
this week was not ozone, which is invisible and considered the most threatening 
to human health, but microscopic particles. 
</P>
<P>
While these particles also are a health concern, they are primarily bothersome 
because of their ability to absorb light and obscure visibility.

The eyes have it: Call us, say the folks spending millions of dollars to oppose 
Proposition 134, and we will send you a copy of the measure that would put a 
new tax on beer, wine and liquor. The proposal itself, the opponents claim, is 
the best argument against the tax. 
</P>
<P>
But what arrives in the mail is a document written in teensy-weensy type. 
However, notations in the margin -- with a decided editorial slant in favor of 
the alcohol industry's view -- are nice and big and printed in blue for easy 
scanning. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 22,000 people have requested copies of the initiative from the 
industry-backed Taxpayers for Common Sense. For those who don't want to squint, 
the California Ballot Pamphlet in October will provide all voters with a full 
text of the proposal -- in larger type and without the margin comments.

Surrogate circuit: Gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson has no shortage of 
assistance coming his way from Republican heavy hitters this season, with 
President Bush headlining two fund-raisers in California next week, and Barbara 
Bush coming to the state the first week of October. But for Democratic 
candidate Dianne Feinstein, surrogate planning has hit a snag. Some of the 
party's name politicians, like New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, are engaged in 
election campaigns of their own. Others, like Senate and Congressional leaders, 
are caught up in budget negotiations and the closing rush of the legislative 
season. "We've had inquiries from everyone and interest depends on when 
Congress leaves Washington," said Feinstein's campaign director, Bill Carrick.

Update: The "Women's Choice" slate mailer destined for 2.5 million women voters 
has been re-tagged to settle the objections of abortion rights advocates who 
complained that the title implied that all the candidates on it favored 
abortion rights. Rob Rice, whose California Communicators firm is sponsoring 
the statewide mailer, said it was renamed "California Womens' Voter Guide." 
Said Rice: "Although I still really disagree with the contention, I decided if 
it was going to hurt their efforts, I was going to pull it." Robin Schneider, 
executive director of the California Abortion Rights Action League, which 
requested the change, said she considered the new name a "small but significant 
victory."

UC PRESIDENT ASKS RENEWAL OF PACTS FOR WEAPON LABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Despite faculty opposition, UC President David P. Gardner on Thursday urged 
that the university renew its federal contracts to run nuclear weapons 
laboratories because of benefits to national security. 
</P>
<P>
His statement was widely viewed as proof that the regents will vote next week 
to continue the controversial ties with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos 
national laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
UC has managed federal weapons research facilities since World War II and to 
drop that relationship now "could place at risk laboratories that have proven 
to be such significant assets to the nation's security and its scientific and 
technological advancement," Gardner said in a report to the regents released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gardner contended that the easing of tensions between the United 
States and the Soviet Union may shift the labs to work on more non-defense 
energy projects. Such unclassified experiments, he said, would allow greater 
involvement by UC faculty and students. Critics now complain that the 
top-secret nature of the labs is at odds with academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The current multibillion-dollar contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy 
expire in 1992. The regents must indicate at their meeting at UCLA next 
Thursday and Friday whether they intend to start negotiations for another 
five-year renewal. 
</P>
<P>
UC management of the labs has been debated since the 1960s, raising issues 
usually not discussed by the regents: relations with the Soviet Union, morality 
of nuclear weapons, storage of atomic wastes and feasibility of the Strategic 
Defense Initiative, popularly known as the Star Wars defense system. Never 
before, however, has the UC faculty so clearly voiced its opposition to the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a UC-wide faculty committee voted 6 to 2 to recommend that ties 
to the laboratories be ended, saying that the secret research "is contrary to 
the fundamental nature of the university" and that the labs require too much 
attention from UC administrators. Last spring, 64% of all professors who 
participated in referenda on UC campuses voted to urge the regents to drop the 
labs. The faculty senates of all nine campuses agreed, although the margins 
against contract renewal ranged from the overwhelming 312 to 75 at UC Santa 
Barbara to the squeaker 204 to 201 at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's aides claim that opposition to the labs may be overstated because 
only 42% of the professors participated in the votes last spring, although 
faculty leaders stress that such a turnout is higher than in state and national 
elections. Some UC professors complain that Gardner has tried to shield the 
regents from faculty dissension on the issue and predict long-term friction 
between the administration and faculty. Gardner insists the regents have been 
kept fully informed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Charles Schwartz, a UC Berkeley physics professor and a longtime 
opponent of the labs, was arrested and cited for trespassing late Wednesday for 
refusing to leave the UC system headquarters in downtown Oakland at closing 
time. Schwartz had spent most of Wednesday unsuccessfully seeking to meet with 
Gardner on the labs. Gardner, however, met Thursday with two of Schwartz's 
colleagues in the campaign against the labs. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner did not accede to a call from 14 legislators this week for UC to drop 
the contracts because of alleged toxic and radioactive leaks at the labs that, 
the lawmakers said, "pose serious public health and environmental hazards." 
</P>
<P>
Even opponents of the lab ties concede that approval next week by the regents 
to start contract negotiations with the government is a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid it's not going to be even a close vote. And I'm disappointed with 
that," said Karl Hufbauer, a UC Irvine history professor and an expert on the 
development of nuclear weapons who served on the systemwide committee that 
called for contract phase-out. However, Hufbauer predicted that UC eventually 
will drop the labs. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government owns the labs at Livermore, 35 miles east of Oakland, 
and Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was developed. The U.S. 
Energy Department sets policies and pays UC about $2 billion a year for 
equipment, management of the experiments and salaries for the 16,000 employees 
at the two facilities. UC clears about $11 million a year, a figure that 
Gardner said may have to be increased in the next contracts. 
</P>
<P>
UC's involvement attracts top scientists and allows internal debate that a 
private company or the military would not permit, UC officials contend. But 
critics complain that UC really has little say and that the government uses the 
university as a cover of academic respectability for weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, UC beefed up its supervision of the labs by adding new liaison 
officers. That was in response to a series of political and environmental 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the laboratories alleged that Livermore officials exaggerated 
technical progress on the Strategic Defense Initiative to ensure more funding 
and improperly lobbied members of Congress to vote against further limitations 
on underground testing of nuclear weapons. The feasibility of SDI remains hotly 
debated, although a report by the federal General Accounting Office found the 
lobbying was not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Livermore facility has received much bad publicity about 
possible leaks of toxic and radioactive materials, drug use by employees and 
theft of government supplies. 
</P>
<P>
UC's contract to run the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley also is up 
for renewal but is not controversial because the energy and biotech research 
there is not related to weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
The regents' meeting next week at UCLA coincides with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish 
New Year. Some professors and staff interested in the labs issue but unable to 
attend because of religious observances asked for a delay in the vote. But UC 
officials declined, saying that regents must settle the matter at this month's 
session.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ahmed Shaki, whose son Yassin was beaten to death on suspicion of informing for 
the Israeli army, has been waiting in vain for the killers to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Shaki maintains that his son was a victim of mistaken identity and that, if his 
Palestinian executioners would just admit so, it would clear up a blot on the 
family's history. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a letter would do," pleaded Shaki, who lives in the crowded valley 
neighborhood of Silwan outside Jerusalem's Old City under the shadow of the 
golden Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's best-known mosques. 
</P>
<P>
But in the darkened atmosphere of an uprising torn by internal conflict, hardly 
anyone says he is sorry -- and it will probably never be known whether the 
20-year-old Yassin was an informer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparatively Risky 
</P>
<P>
The killing of collaborators is becoming so commonplace that in July and August 
it was riskier for a Palestinian to be suspected of working for the Israelis 
than to engage in protests against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians killed up to 13 of their own in July and 12 in August, according 
to several accounts. Although the reason for the bloodshed was inevitably given 
as collaboration, the rationale sometimes seemed to be a flimsy veneer for 
settling personal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Palestinians during all of July and only 
one in August -- the lowest total by far in the 33-month-old Palestinian 
uprising. In all, more than 250 Palestinians have died at the hands of other 
Palestinians; more than 660 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis -- mainly 
by troops, but a few by civilians. Forty-seven Israelis have died. 
</P>
<P>
With its fog of suspicion and half-understood enmities, the Yassin Shaki case 
is typical of the current wave of intra-Palestinian killings in the intifada, 
as the uprising is called in Arabic. Shaki, a gardener employed at Hebrew 
University, had no enemies, his family insisted. Yet at least half the masked 
young men who came to kill him were from Silwan and appeared to know him, his 
father recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Yassin Shaki was questioned and beaten by the gang and returned home, but even 
with this warning he did not flee. Flight would be viewed as an admission of 
guilt. A rumor spread that during a brief stint in jail he was somehow enticed 
into informing for the Israelis; even that failed to scare him into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
In Silwan, arrests of Palestinians by the Israeli army may have indirectly led 
to Yassin Shaki's death. When, on July 22, masked men came to his house to take 
him for the last time, were they really convinced that he was a spy or were 
they just blindly hitting out at the unseen hand of Israeli intelligence? 
</P>
<P>
"They could not get to the real guilty people, so they took my son," Ahmed 
Shaki said. The son died of internal bleeding caused by repeated kicks in the 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
Killings such as this have spurred urgent activity by public spokesmen for the 
uprising. Some try to play down the killings as lamentable but inevitable: 
Under occupation, they point out, Palestinians are not allowed to install any 
kind of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"What is really surprising is that there is not complete anarchy," said Ibrahim 
Karaaim, director of the Palestine Press Service in Jerusalem, which often 
reflects the opinions of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the declared 
Palestinian leadership-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to justify this, but you have to differentiate between the 
majority of the population and radicals who have different ideas," Karaaim 
said. "It is a problem for us because the whole world is waiting for the 
Palestinians to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Ill Seen 
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinian observers view the killings as less of a public relations 
problem and more of an internal ill that is draining the energies of 
Palestinians away from fighting the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the intensity of intra-Arab killing is taken by Israeli authorities 
as proof that terror reigns in the West Bank and Gaza and that no steps can be 
taken toward Israel's plan of holding Palestinian elections until calm is 
restored.

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS

<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Fears of an Iran-Iraq alliance were eased as the United States said there was 
no evidence that Iran was violating U.N. trade sanctions, and Iranian officials 
have denied any agreement to swap food and medicine for embargoed Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.N., the Security Council approved arrangements for the dispatch of 
food to Iraq and Kuwait in the case of urgent humanitarian need. Earlier, the 
Senate approved a bill imposing sanctions against any country that uses 
chemical or biological weapons. The bill also increases penalties for violating 
the embargo against Iraq, up to $1 million in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
In Mecca, 400 Muslim leaders from 60 countries adopted a declaration that 
accuses Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of violating the tenets of the faith by 
invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has successfully test-fired a medium-range missile outfitted with a 
chemical weapons warhead. The test shows that the potential threat to U.S. 
troops and Saudi sites is greater than once believed. Iraq also warned of 
possible terrorist attacks against U.S. forces in a memo given to a U.S. 
official in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, U.S. troops peppered Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, with questions about how soon they could go home. Powell 
also urged European nations to join the multinational force with tanks and 
personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pentagon nixed the postmaster general's offer to allow military 
personnel in the gulf to send mail free, saying Congress and President Bush 
must approve the action. AT&amp;T said it will allow families of soldiers free 
use of fax machines at 400 centers beginning next week in a program called 
Desert Fax. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
The Administration unveiled an array of voluntary initiatives to encourage fuel 
conservation and promote domestic oil production. But it admitted that it is 
bracing for worldwide oil shortages as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said if necessary, the United States is 
planning to draw some supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve, which 
holds nearly 600 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>

'WAR LOBBY' URGES MILITARY SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
HAWKS: ADVOCATES SEE A NECESSITY TO EITHER REMOVE HUSSEIN OR DESTROY IRAQ'S WAR

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Bush Administration backs away from talk of war with Iraq and emphasizes 
a long-term campaign of economic sanctions and international isolation, a vocal 
"war lobby" has emerged to press for more bellicose policies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his top aides now argue, at least publicly, that the United States 
should concentrate on using sanctions and diplomacy to prod Iraq into leaving 
Kuwait. Once that has been accomplished, the United States would then need to 
establish a new international security structure for long-term containment of 
Saddam Hussein's military power, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of military action against Iraq argue that such a lengthy 
commitment of U.S. power to the Persian Gulf cannot sustain public support at 
home or political support in the Arab world. They point out that even the 
mention of such a long-term security structure by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III last week was enough to set off a sharp negative reaction in Arab 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they argue, Hussein represents such a threat that containment is not a 
sufficient response. Instead, they say, the United States must either remove 
Hussein or destroy Iraq's military machine -- steps that would almost certainly 
involve the use of military power. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the question remains "an intellectual debate," as one senior 
Administration official sympathetic with the war lobby put it, because the 
United States does not yet have the forces in place to launch an offensive 
action against Iraq even if Bush decided he wanted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Events have not reached a point where we're forced to choose," the official 
said. But relatively soon, as heavier U.S. equipment begins to arrive in Saudi 
Arabia, that picture will change, the official said -- and both the pro-war 
argument and its advocates are likely to be heard with renewed strength. 
</P>
<P>
The war lobby has both a domestic and a foreign component. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, Indiana Sen. Richard G. Lugar, the most influential Republican 
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been the leading 
congressional voice in favor of a military policy against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Lugar argued that a policy relying solely on a 
continued buildup of U.S. forces in the region is "probably insufficient" 
because it would "leave us in the sands of Saudi Arabia indefinitely" watching 
Hussein and his quest for nuclear weapons while waiting for hostilities to 
break out. 
</P>
<P>
American policy "has to lead to a sizable change in Iraq's military forces," he 
said, "or I think we are in an untenable position." At least some military 
officials are known to support Lugar's view, fearing that the public would not 
support keeping U.S. forces in the Middle East for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought not to rush in until we have our affairs in order," Lugar said, 
adding that he did not believe sufficient troops for an attack would be in 
place until October. But "there comes an optimum time," he said, when Iraq is 
weakened by sanctions and U.S. forces are ready. Once that point is reached, 
according to Lugar, "the aggression has to be repelled along with the force 
that caused it." 
</P>
<P>
Lugar, joined by several other influential members of Congress, had dinner with 
Bush late in August at which he outlined his views to the President. "The 
consensus of the group was that even if one agreed with my 'final mission' 
statement, it should not be something we should be enunciating at this time," 
Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lugar is the only prominent member of Congress to publicly advocate a 
military course, he has been joined by many prominent members of Washington's 
policy- and opinion-making Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Such individuals, although they hold no formal government post, can often be 
highly influential in shaping government policy, either because of longstanding 
personal ties with current officials or because they help rally public support 
for an option that an Administration might be reluctant to advocate in public. 
</P>
<P>
The "war lobby" first publicly appeared in Washington late in August when a 
spate of articles appeared on newspaper opinion pages and in influential 
magazines insisting that Bush should take a stronger stand in favor of 
eliminating Iraq's military potential. At about the same time, Lugar made his 
first public statements about the need for military power to remove Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
That campaign began at the same time that senior Administration officials 
privately started telling reporters that Bush had decided, at least for now, to 
leave aside the military option and concentrate on diplomacy and economic 
sanctions as a way of ending the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Among those leading the war campaign, one group is made up of former government 
officials and private-sector policy experts whose main concern has been to halt 
the spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals in a second, larger and more influential group share a long history 
of support for Israel, which has long seen Iraq as a major threat that it 
wishes to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more publicly prominent members of that group are columnist William 
Safire, former Reagan Administration defense official Richard N. Perle and 
Martin Peretz, editor of New Republic magazine, all of whom have publicly 
campaigned for the Administration to adopt elimination of Hussein as its 
ultimate policy option. 
</P>
<P>
Although former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has not explicitly 
advocated war against Iraq, a mid-August article he wrote analyzing the threat 
posed by Hussein was widely seen as giving support to the pro-war side. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates of a war policy also have been bolstered by analysts from the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank with close ties to the 
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the capital's leading pro-Israel 
lobbying organization. Washington Institute experts on the region are 
frequently quoted in television, radio and newspaper stories about the gulf 
standoff, although their organization's pro-Israel orientation is seldom cited. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, in addition to officials from Israel, some from Egypt, Saudi Arabia 
and the exiled government of Kuwait have quietly -- behind the scenes -- 
advocated U.S. military action. Some British officials have also voiced pro-war 
views to reporters, usually anonymously, although the official British position 
supports the Administration's more gradual approach. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been the most public of the Middle Eastern 
leaders in supporting a policy whose implementation could well lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, while Baker was in Cairo, Mubarak said that the gulf would be 
unstable so long as Iraq possessed chemical weapons and continued to seek 
nuclear arms. The Egyptian president suggested that only a military defeat of 
Iraq could ensure peace. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that throughout the crisis, Middle Eastern 
governments that favor war have tried to influence American opinion by serving 
as sources for news reports suggesting that international sanctions against 
Iraq are being violated. The stories, some of which Administration officials 
insist have been exaggerated, could be designed to influence U.S. public 
opinion by convincing people that the non-military options will be ineffective, 
the officials say.

BAGHDAD RENEWS ITS VERBAL ATTACK ON U.S. MILITARY BUILDUP IN MIDEAST;

DEPLOYMENT: 'BUSH HAD BETTER WITHDRAW,' IRAQI SAYS. SYRIA IS SENDING A BRIGADE 
TO SAUDI ARABIA.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the heels of its first tenuous diplomatic success in the Persian Gulf 
crisis, Iraq on Thursday followed the call of its old enemy, Iran, and renewed 
its attack on the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, responding to President Bush's address to Congress 
on Tuesday night, insisted that Iraq has no intention to invade Saudi Arabia or 
any other gulf state. 
</P>
<P>
"We challenge the U.S. President to present tangible proof of his allegations," 
Aziz said in remarks published Thursday. "Bush had better withdraw his forces 
and reduce American expenditure on war." 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired foreign minister was fresh from a trip to Tehran, a visit 
that resulted in the renewal of diplomatic relations between the two countries. 
On Wednesday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian spiritual leader, harshly 
attacked the American troop buildup in the gulf and called for a holy war on 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And Iraq warned Thursday of possible terrorist attacks against U.S. forces, 
sounding the theme of Arab feelings wounded by the presence of non-Muslim 
soldiers massed in the holy lands of Saudi Arabia, wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's warning came in a memorandum to the U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad, 
according to the Iraqi News Agency. The service said Iraq was responding to a 
U.S. claim that Iraq-based terrorists were preparing to attack U.S. targets. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is creating a "pretext" for aggression, the memorandum was 
quoted as saying, and "Iraq reserves its legitimate right to self-defense, to 
reciprocate and to retaliate firmly against these parties if it becomes a 
target," the news agency added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria was reported to be sending an armored brigade, involving up to 
10,000 troops and 300 tanks, to Saudi Arabia in a signal of its new role in the 
Middle East. Western diplomats told Reuters news service that the Saudi 
government had asked Damascus to send the division to supplement the 3,000 
Syrian troops already there. About 1,000 Syrian troops are in the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Western diplomats, the number of Syrian troops expected to be 
deployed in the crisis may reach 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Baghdad has worked hard to win support 
from Iran, with which it engaged in a bloody, eight-year war that ended in 
1988. Iran, with its long land border, could make or break a trade embargo 
imposed on Iraq by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a lightning diplomatic move, 
pulled his troops out of land that Iraq had occupied during the war and gave in 
on all the border issues that were at stake in the conflict. The countries 
agreed to exchange prisoners of war and, following Aziz's visit, to take steps 
to normalize diplomatic and trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Tehran Times newspaper, which often reflects the views of the 
Iranian government, denied that Iran would exchange food and cash for Iraqi 
oil. It quoted an "informed source" in Tehran as saying the government had not 
yet decided whether to allow shipments into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But Iran's enmity toward the United States, dating from the 1979 Shiite Muslim 
revolution, could tempt Tehran to play a spoiler's role in the gulf crisis: The 
mullahs who rule Iran might undermine the sanctions enough to keep Iraq afloat 
-- and force the United States to choose between remaining bogged down in Saudi 
Arabia or opening fire on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran can sit back and watch its enemies struggle over this one," said one 
Western European diplomat, noting that it was a reverse of the situation during 
the Iran-Iraq war, when much of the world stood by and watched the warring 
neighbors fight it out. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's counteroffensive against the U.N. trade sanctions continues to center on 
the needs of tens of thousands of Asian refugees stranded in both Iraq and 
Kuwait. The refugees are forbidden to buy food in Iraq, and supplies are 
reportedly running short in Kuwait. Baghdad is demanding that Asian 
governments, particularly India and the Philippines, send food to their 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Western governments want any food deliveries to the Asians handled by the 
International Red Cross or some other foreign relief agency. One U.S. diplomat 
has accused Iraq of "cynical manipulation" of the refugees' suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq counters that the shortages are the fault of the blockade and that 
shipments should enter the country like regular imports. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Red Cross and its Islamic counterpart, the Red Crescent, 
reached an agreement to supply medicines to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
Gen. Colin L. Powell, visited with U.S. forces and said the American troops 
"are deterring (Iraq) now, and with each passing day, our defensive capability 
gets better and better." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Powell responded to repeated questions about the U.S. 
deployment's ultimate size and purpose by saying the U.S. military has not been 
assigned an offensive mission. 
</P>
<P>
"The only mission I have been assigned is to deter and defend," he declared. 
"The force is being structured for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't sell them short. They are good for the long haul," Powell said.

If you want to keep up with official Washington terminology, take the term 
"burden-sharing" out of your vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration isn't using it any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Burden-sharing" was the term commonly used in recent years for U.S. efforts to 
persuade allies such as Japan, West Germany and South Korea to help pay for the 
costs of stationing American troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt told a congressional hearing this 
week that U.S. policy-makers think the word is misleading. "We don't think the 
defense of freedom and democracy is a burden," explained Kimmitt. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmitt offered a substitute, which he used on several occasions during 
congressional testimony: "responsibility-sharing."

areas poses no danger, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Walters will board the train tonight in Miesau in the southwest to travel to 
the North Sea port of Nordenham, where the poison gas shells will be loaded on 
ships and taken to the Pacific for destruction, the embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next week, two trains a night will take 400 tons of U.S. chemical arms 
on two routes about 370 miles from Miesau to Nordenham.

STAY ON BOOK ABOUT ISRAELI AGENTS UPSET; 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP: JERUSALEM ARGUES THAT THE WORK ENDANGERS ITS INTELLIGENCE 
OPERATIVES. THE PUBLISHER SAYS IT WAS BEING SILENCED BY A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

Arguing that it was being muzzled by a foreign government, St. Martin's Press 
on Thursday won an appeal overturning an injunction that had restrained the 
company from distributing a book purporting to expose the Mossad, Israel's 
super-secret intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
Issuing a brief ruling in the precedent-setting case, the Appellate Division of 
the New York Supreme Court dismissed a stay issued by a lower court judge 
Wednesday. The Israeli government had sought the stay on the grounds that 
publication of the book would endanger its intelligence operatives. 
</P>
<P>
The book purports to name Mossad agents, and describes the intelligence 
agency's alleged operations and training techniques. 
</P>
<P>
It also contains the sensational charge that Israel knew in advance about a 
terrorist attack in Lebanon that killed 241 American servicemen in October, 
1983, but withheld full information about the impending action because it 
wanted to poison relations between the United States and Arab nations. The 
Israeli government has vehemently denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
The four-judge Appellate Division panel ruled that the Israeli government had 
failed to show that the book endangered the lives of its agents. The judges 
said the publisher already had shipped 17,000 copies of the book, including 
many newspaper review copies, and "any grant of injunctive relief in this case 
would be ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
The temporary injunction apparently was the first time that a foreign 
government has blocked, even briefly, distribution of published material in the 
United States. The Israeli government obtained a similar injunction that 
remains in force in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin on Wednesday had ordered St. 
Martin's Press to cease publication and distribution of the book, pending a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a case of a foreign government reaching across our borders and 
telling Americans what they can read and what they can publish," said Thomas 
McCormack, chief executive officer of St. Martin's Press. "It is totally 
unacceptable and I am gratified they were stopped." 
</P>
<P>
McCormack said his company had received 50,000 orders for the book, "By Way of 
Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer," by former agent Victor 
Ostrovsky and Canadian journalist Claire Hoy. He said St. Martin's had decided 
to print 100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Thursday with the Washington Post, Ostrovsky said he 
has been in hiding in Canada to avoid being kidnaped and taken to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 5, Ostrovsky said, two men he described as "ranking Mossad agents" 
appeared at his home and warned that, for his "own safety," he should try to 
stop publication of the book. Since then, he said, he has lived like a 
fugitive, sleeping at a different place each night. "It's scary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack said that "it is my understanding (the agents) did not threaten him. 
They tried to reason with him and perhaps tried to assure him if he abandoned 
this book, there would be no loss in income because of the decision. I was not 
told that any overt, any explicit threats were conveyed." 
</P>
<P>
John Lerner, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, 
Meagher &amp; Flom, which represented the Israeli government, said discussions 
were under way whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether a former employee of a foreign intelligence agency is 
going to be permitted to breach his contractual duties to a foreign government 
and inflict irreparable harm on employees of that government and whether that 
conduct will be restrained. There are names in the book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate decision "eviscerates protection that should be given to our 
secrets. What happens to a CIA agent breaching his duty who publishes in 
Israel? The hallmark of comity between the laws of various nations is 
reciprocity . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said Ostrovsky, 40, was born in Edmonton, Canada, and 
immigrated to Israel in the mid-1950s. He served in the military police and 
reached the rank of captain before joining the Israeli navy. He later served 
with the Mossad for two years before being dismissed as unreliable and returned 
to Canada.

KIN MAY REMOVE FOOD TUBES, SAYS TOP FLORIDA COURT

The Florida Supreme Court ruled Thursday that relatives or guardians can order 
the removal of feeding tubes that keep brain-damaged people alive, even if the 
patients have not signed "living wills." 
</P>
<P>
The justices said the guardians do not need a court's approval in each 
individual case. 
</P>
<P>
However, the patient must have expressed, at least verbally, a preference for 
dying rather than being kept alive with feeding tubes. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of the "right-to-die" decision, which came in the case of an 
89-year-old woman who died last summer, is the right to privacy in the state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"This case resolves a question of an individual's constitutional right of 
self-determination," Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote in the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The woman at the center of the case, Estelle Browning, spent the last 2 1/2 
years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had earlier, in a "living 
will," said she did not want. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in a vegetative 
state, unable to swallow or communicate. She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, 
Browning's second cousin and only living relative, was named her guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state fought the 
request and a trial court denied it. But a state appeals court said the state's 
constitution allowed it, and the issue was reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Federal officials have fined Johnson City $6,000 for removing catalytic 
converters from police cruisers in a bid to protect police dogs' sense of 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
The smell of the anti-pollution devices temporarily deadens the dogs' sniffing 
power, police dog handlers say. Law-enforcement officials say they may need 
those minutes when tracking a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
A city official two years ago authorized removing catalytic converters from 
cruisers transporting police dogs. But the Environmental Protection Agency 
found out about it and fined the city $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Campbell said Wednesday that the city may appeal. He said the 
city otherwise has had a good compliance record with the Clean Air Act.

Negotiators for the Salvadoran government and leftist rebels began a key round 
of talks in San Jose, Costa Rica, aimed at ending a decade of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The insurgents said it was up to the government to avoid violence by agreeing 
to purge and restructure the army. Army officials meanwhile said the guerrillas 
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front attacked paramilitary civil 
defense positions overnight. Rebel and government representatives agreed to a 
series of talks last April in a U.N.-brokered accord, but the two sides remain 
deadlocked over rebel demands for a purge of officers who, they charge, have 
been involved in human rights abuses.

OCT. 1 DEADLINE IS URGED FOR SOVIET REFORMS;

ECONOMY: GORBACHEV ADVISER PUSHES FOR QUICK APPROVAL. PLAN CALLS FOR PUTTING 
NATION'S FACTORIES INTO PRIVATE HANDS WITHIN 500 DAYS.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic adviser said Thursday that he hopes 
lawmakers around the country will agree by Oct. 1 on a radical reform plan to 
sell off most of the Soviet economy into private hands and decentralize 
decision-making within 500 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come when we must choose," Nikolai Y. Petrakov told a news 
conference he had called to explain the status of competing proposals for 
transition to a market-oriented economy after weeks of bickering. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had announced the previous day that a final draft for the reforms had 
been forged from the more radical proposals of a group led by Soviet economist 
Stanislav S. Shatalin and the centralized, more deliberate approach of Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
The Shatalin plan, the intellectual offspring of an economists' task force 
created by Gorbachev and Russian Federation leader Boris N. Yeltsin, was made 
public in its complete form Thursday for the first time. It mandates a 
near-total break with the top-heavy bureaucratic economics that date back to 
the era of Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the plan means that the Soviet Union has gone capitalist, Petrakov 
said that what is important now is results, not labels. 
</P>
<P>
"We need an effective economy in the first place," he said. "As for the 
terminology, we must make the point clear: If it is the socialism which Stalin 
created, then we are rejecting it." 
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of the Shatalin plan obtained by The Times, it seeks within 
500 days the selling or leasing into private hands of no less than 70% of the 
country's factories and up to 90% of its construction enterprises, wholesale 
and retail trade network, restaurants and services. 
</P>
<P>
Under an "economic union of sovereign republics," the Soviet Union's 
increasingly restive local territorial units are granted the "exclusive right" 
to regulate the ownership, use and management of all wealth in their 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
To be full-fledged members of the new union, however, the republics would have 
to delegate certain powers to the central government, including defense, state 
security and responsibility for a single, unified monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
By Jan. 1, as part of the initial stage of the reforms, all government 
subsidies to enterprises are to cease, and 100 to 200 unprofitable plants are 
to be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The unified document, Gorbachev said, has been submitted to the Supreme Soviet, 
the national legislature, and to lawmakers in the country's 15 republics for 
their consideration. But Petrakov indicated that there had been no genuine 
compromise, and he said the regional parliaments had been sent copies of the 
original Ryzhkov and Shatalin plans, plus a third blueprint heavily based on 
the Shatalin proposals but containing a "few valuable aspects" from Ryzhkov's. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said that merging the two plans would be as impossible as mating a 
hedgehog and a snake, and he is seeking rapid implementation for the Shatalin 
plan. The Russian Parliament has already heeded him and approved it in 
principle, with only one dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
As debate continued over the reform plans, bad economic news continued 
unabated. Izvestia, the government newspaper, printed official statistics 
showing that in the first eight months of 1990, Soviet industrial output 
dropped by 0.7% compared with the same period a year earlier.

FRIENDSHIP PACT SIGNED BY W. GERMANY, SOVIETS

West Germany and the Soviet Union Thursday initialed a 20-year friendship 
treaty that is aimed at expanding bilateral ties and building greater trust. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, which will serve as a framework for German-Soviet political 
relations as well as economic and technical matters, was initialed by West 
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place a day after the two Germanys and the four Allied powers 
of World War II signed a treaty that will restore full sovereignty to a united 
Germany on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's document, officially the Treaty on Good Neighborliness, Partnership 
and Cooperation, contains a call for closer political consultation, expanded 
trade and greater unofficial contacts between Soviets and Germans. 
</P>
<P>
It includes a series of confidence-building measures aimed at easing the 
concerns of two nations that have lost 30 million people in two wars in this 
century. It speaks of a common wish to make a final break with the past and 
work toward greater understanding and reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Both nations renounced any and all territorial claims and pledged that no such 
claims would be made in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We can now say, with justification, that the postwar period is at an end," 
Genscher said at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Germany lost roughly 26,000 square miles of territory with the collapse of the 
Third Reich in 1945. Roughly half of that, including most of East Prussia, was 
integrated into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Many people from those areas now live in West Germany and, through a 
well-organized lobbying effort, have resisted any official admission that these 
lands are no longer German. 
</P>
<P>
The new treaty guarantees cultural and language rights to the German-speaking 
people of the Soviet Union, many of whom have roots there that go back for 
centuries. The so-called Volga Germans, who for many years were concentrated 
along the Volga River, were dispersed during the Josef Stalin era and their 
culture suppressed.

U.S. SAID READY TO PHASE OUT MILITARY BASES IN PHILIPPINES

The Bush Administration is ready to begin phasing out U.S. military bases in 
the Philippines, acknowledging for the first time that the end of the Cold War 
has lessened the need for the facilities, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With negotiations on the bases scheduled to begin Tuesday in Manila, U.S. 
negotiators will seek a phase-out period that could last up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
That would be followed by continued military access to the facilities, perhaps 
on a commercial basis, after the last American forces depart, according to 
officials familiar with the U.S. negotiating stance. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the United States will not propose a definite timetable for 
departing from the facilities -- Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Subic Bay 
Naval Station in Olongapo and four smaller installations. Instead, they said, 
the U.S. negotiating panel will stress the need for a gradual withdrawal to 
allow sufficient time for the Philippine government to prepare alternative 
plans for the bases and to cushion what is expected to be another adverse blow 
to the Philippine economy. 
</P>
<P>
The bases have become an irritant in U.S.-Philippine relations under the 
government of President Corazon Aquino, as a vocal nationalist minority has 
stepped up demands for their removal. Opponents see them as the last vestige of 
U.S. domination of a former colony, and an infringement on Philippine 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Philippine Communists on Thursday urged Aquino to open peace talks 
to end one of Asia's oldest insurgencies after an indefinite limited truce 
began in Manila and northern parts of the country. The future of U.S. military 
bases in the Philippines is one of the issues that should be discussed, the 
Communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) said.

<P>
A former top aide to convicted former state Sen. Joseph Montoya was sentenced 
Thursday to 90 days in jail for lying on a Veterans Administration home loan 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Amiel Jaramillo, 36, originally was charged with racketeering, extortion and 
conspiracy along with his former boss, who is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence in 
federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors agreed to dismiss the corruption charges against Jaramillo in 
exchange for his guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to a 
government agency. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an eight-woman, four-man jury Thursday began deliberating the case 
of former Sen. Paul Carpenter, on trial in federal court on four charges of 
racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. Carpenter was indicted as a result of 
the same investigation of Capitol corruption that snared Montoya and Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter jurors started their deliberations after U.S. District Judge 
Edward Garcia read them a series of detailed instructions on the complex 
federal racketeering and extortion laws. Carpenter, a Democrat who is now a 
member of the State Board of Equalization, faces a maximum of 80 years in 
prison and a fine of up to $750,000 if he is convicted on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
In Jaramillo's case, he admitted that he failed to disclose that he owed more 
than $18,000 in student loans when he filed an application for a Veterans 
Administration mortgage loan application in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Christopher Wing said federal probation officers had 
recommended that Jaramillo, now a lawyer in private practice, should not serve 
any time behind bars. But U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, who presided over Montoya's trial earlier this year, said that in 
handing down the sentence it would be unfair to consider evidence of 
Jaramillo's complicity in Montoya's crimes because Jaramillo would have no 
opportunity to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"But if the things that came out at that trial were true, there would be a 
substantial incarceration sentence," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo was given until Nov. 1 to begin serving his sentence. The delay will 
give Jaramillo time to wage a legal fight to retain his license to practice 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo was chief consultant to the state Senate Business and Professions 
Committee, of which Montoya was chairman.

The Greater Los Angeles Area Zoo Assn. board -- which includes a number of 
Hollywood celebrities -- said Thursday it was "very disturbed" by reports of 
substandard conditions at the Los Angeles Zoo and will join in a city 
investigation of chronic violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act. 
</P>
<P>
"It came like a shock to all of us," said actress Betty White, a board member. 
"This came as just a shattering experience." 
</P>
<P>
White said she questions the competence of zoo Director Warren Thomas, but will 
wait to hear his explanation before judging the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be an awfully good other side to not have me up in arms," she 
added.

A statement issued by the 37-member board said they had not been informed about 
repeated citations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as a warning 
letter from the agriculture department that the zoo's license could be revoked 
if the violations were repeated. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Thomas defended his management of the zoo and his 
staff's competence and dedication to good animal care. He also said many of the 
violations have been corrected and the rest will be addressed. "There's no 
excuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported on Thursday that the Griffith Park facility had been cited 
repeatedly by USDA inspectors for more than three years for inadequate food 
storage, sanitation and drainage problems, pest and rodent contamination, 
inadequate housing, run-down animal barns and other violations of federal 
regulations. Thomas also never replied to a letter sent to him by the USDA 
nearly a year ago demanding an immediate response. 
</P>
<P>
City officials reacted swiftly Thursday. Mayor Tom Bradley, who is traveling in 
Europe, said in a letter issued by his staff that he is "deeply concerned" 
about the violations found by the USDA and is "disappointed" that Thomas had 
failed to notify the appropriate officials of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent to Jim Hadaway, general manager of the Department of 
Recreation and Parks, demanded an immediate report on the matter. The zoo is 
owned by the city and operated by the Recreation and Parks Department in 
conjunction with the 135,000-member zoo association. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for City Councilman Joel Wachs said that the council's Arts, Health 
and Humanities Committee, which Wachs chairs, will hold a hearing on the 
problems at the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, Thomas repeated his statement that he was 
unaware of the USDA complaints until recent weeks and had begun a crash program 
to address the problems. He said lower-level employees had failed to inform him 
of the federal inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thomas signed a lengthy USDA inspection report more than a year ago 
describing the violations, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the apparent discrepancy, Thomas acknowledged that he signed the 
report, but said that he did not read it. Instead, because of its length, he 
passed it on to a staff member for analysis but never heard about it again, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was fired from the job of zoo director in 1986, but was reinstated the 
following year by a federal judge who ruled that the firing had been improper. 
</P>
<P>
In firing Thomas, city officials cited problems with various purchases and 
sales. They also alleged that Thomas used racial epithets around zoo employees 
and took zoo supplies for his own use. They argued that he was fired for good 
cause, but the judge ruled that his civil rights had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Tellefsen, a real estate developer and chairman of the association 
board, said the association intends to help the city investigate the current 
problems and will take up the matter at an executive session next week. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation took us by surprise," Tellefsen said. "We had no knowledge 
about the USDA citations . . . and therefore we were pretty upset when we 
learned about it." 
</P>
<P>
The association is a nonprofit corporation that helps operate and raise funds 
for the zoo. Its volunteer board is made up of business people and celebrities 
including White, actresses Stephanie Powers and Carmen Zapata, and Gloria 
Stewart.

RIDERS APPLAUD RTD'S BEEFED-UP SECURITY

<P>
It was in the 90s outside and not much cooler inside the lumbering No. 30 bus 
as it roared out of downtown, heavy with a standing-room-only load of shoppers 
sweating in the aisles. A few feet from Elaine Howard, a woman whispered, 
clucked and burbled to herself. 
</P>
<P>
But Howard uttered not a word of complaint. Things were looking up on the RTD 
these days, she allowed. "I had stopped riding buses for a while. They didn't 
show up on time -- and the gang members. . . . Last year a lot of the buses 
were dirty and graffitied up. But this year is better." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Howard actually saw a couple of transit police from the RTD's new 
uniformed bus patrols enforce the system's no-noshing, no-sipping commandment. 
"They got on and some lady had a soda. I think they gave her a warning because 
it was so hot," she theorized. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Howard's true love is the new 
</P>
<P>
Blue Line light rail service from Los Angeles to Long Beach, which she rides 
home to South-Central Los Angeles. "It's real nice. There's a lot of security. 
The sheriffs are so much better. . . . At each stop they get on and check." 
</P>
<P>
The regulars on the Southern California Rapid Transit District's sprawling bus 
system bump along with a certain stoicism that occasionally can blossom into 
praise. Most have a tale or two of woe about pickpockets, drunks or the guy who 
exposed himself in the back of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last few weeks they've had some good news -- free rides if buses 
are late and beefed-up security. Most bus patrons don't have alternatives, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And hey, it's better than Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"Very nice, very good. It has conditioning and everything," was the assessment 
of Shulim Shuster, recently of Odessa, U.S.S.R., and now of West Hollywood. 
"This is more comfortable. United States is more comfortable. Russia is very 
bad, very old bus, very old," Shuster explained as his relatively new bus 
trundled down Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Bill collector Kelvin Easter has been angling for a free trip under the RTD's 
new program of free fares to riders if their bus is more than 15 minutes late. 
But so far, the RTD has not been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday and Sunday they're usually never on time," he said on a Wilshire 
Boulevard bus as a man with a cast on his arm stretched out on the back seat 
nearby and took a nap. "Sunday night I tested it to see if I could get a free 
ride and it was right on time," Easter recounted with dismay. 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers hadn't taken much notice of the late-bus, no-pay offer. For 
one thing, a good many of them would have to slice through the language barrier 
before they could even begin to negotiate for a free trip. "I no speak English, 
just a little bit," they explain with Spanish, Chinese and Eastern European 
accents as they hold their fingers up, a quarter inch apart, to underscore just 
how little. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a language problem Paul Weaver hasn't bothered about the free 
rides. "I don't even think about it. I never time the buses. I just run like 
hell to catch one," said Weaver, a faithful patron of Los Angeles public 
transit since 1962. Once aboard, his custom is to head to the back, often with 
difficulty. As he wrote in a poem he calls "City Buses": "There's always room 
in the rear, but too many rears in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Riders exhibit more enthusiasm over the news that the RTD is augmenting its 
undercover police crews with a small number of uniformed transit police who 
will patrol downtown Broadway and buses countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never noticed (undercover) police because they're not noticeable" said a 
retired woman with eminent logic as her bus traveled down Pico Boulevard. "I 
think having police in uniform will be much better. But it's probably just a 
fad, for the time being," she added with a knowing air. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a near robbery," she continued. "A guy stuck his hand in my purse. I 
caught him and told him to get his hand out of my purse." Someone else reached 
in once and got away with a pack of Kleenex. "I don't carry a wallet. It's a 
bad thing to carry a wallet in your purse." 
</P>
<P>
On another Pico Boulevard bus, a 21-year-old man said yes, he'd like to see 
more blue uniforms on the bus. "It's good. I just saw someone get killed while 
I was waiting for the bus," he said matter of factly, his voice expressing 
neither wonder nor fright. "Somebody got shot. I think he was dead. I guess it 
was drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Police later said the shooting victim had survived and was hospitalized in 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
At the stop at the corner of Pico Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, waiting 
passengers watched drug dealers peddle plastic bags and count up tangles of 
cash thrust into their hands. A few feet away, a young woman changed her baby's 
diaper while street vendors hawked perfume and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
RTD riders may at times be late, scared and hot, but they're rarely bored.

STATE, DEVELOPER STRIKE DEAL TO SAVE WETLANDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: MOST OF THE PRIZED BALLONA MARSHLANDS WILL BE PROTECTED IN RETURN 
FORTHE REMOVAL OF A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK TO A MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A multifaceted deal was announced Thursday that will protect most of the 
Ballona Wetlands near Marina del Rey while removing a major stumbling block to 
construction of one of the biggest developments in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
Final agreement of the package, negotiated by state Controller Gray Davis, 
calls for the state to sell 70 acres of prime land north of Ballona Creek to 
developer Maguire Thomas Partners for $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Santa Monica-based developer has agreed to save from the 
bulldozers an additional 60 acres of wetlands south of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"Those wetlands will be . . . protected forever," Davis said at a press 
conference"There will never be any development." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, state officials defended offering the valuable land to only 
one developer and then providing a favorable financing package. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also will pave the way for massive development by settling a 
long-running legal battle that has prevented construction of the 
multibillion-dollar Playa Vista residential, office, retail, hotel and marina 
project on surrounding land. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the Santa Monica-based developer has pledged to restore 269 acres 
of what is the largest remaining wetlands in Los Angeles County. The 
once-thriving, but now degraded, marshlands still play host to nearly 200 
species of birds each year, including the endangered Belding's Savannah sparrow 
and California least tern. 
</P>
<P>
A resting spot for birds migrating along the Pacific Flyway from Canada to 
Mexico, the wetlands are also considered an important habitat for wildlife and 
marine fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a giant step toward achieving our goal . . . the preservation and 
restoration of the Ballona Wetlands," said Ruth Lansford, executive director of 
the environmental group Friends of Ballona Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford said the restored freshwater and saltwater wetlands will be "an 
environmental jewel on the Westside of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter hailed the deal as "one of the most 
important steppingstones in a transformation of a long-neglected wetland into a 
thriving, functioning natural environment." 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas wants to construct Playa Vista on about 670 acres of open land 
that extends nearly three miles from the San Diego Freeway toward the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Senior partner Nelson C. Rising said protection of the wetlands is the "key 
ingredient" in settling a lawsuit filed in 1984 by the Friends of Ballona 
Wetlands that blocked development of Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas wants to build 11,750 residential units -- more than all the 
housing in Hermosa Beach -- and 5 million square feet of office space, more 
than twice that of the trademark twin towers of Century City. In addition, 
Playa Vista will contain 720,000 square feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel 
rooms, 25,000 parking spaces and a new small-craft harbor with 750 boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
The property, one of the biggest pieces of prime undeveloped real estate in a 
major American city, was long owned by the eccentric industrialist Howard 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
After Hughes died in 1976, officials of his Summa Corp. began working on plans 
to develop the property. Although Summa won approvals from the city and county 
of Los Angeles and the California Coastal Commission, the project was later 
blocked by the environmentalists' lawsuit seeking protection of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Davis agreed to accept 70 acres in the northeast corner of the 
property east of Marina del Rey in lieu of $75 million in inheritance taxes 
owed California by Hughes' estate. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at home plate on Little League baseball fields that occupy part of the 
site, Davis said Thursday that the settlement was a good one for all concerned. 
"I am confident that the taxpayers are getting a fair return," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the Ballona Wetlands will make a significant contribution 
to the preservation of threatened and endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
Davis defended the absence of competitive bidding on the property and noted 
that a Superior Court judge had determined that the $85 million represents fair 
market value. Chief Deputy Controller James Tucker also called reasonable the 
state's decision to finance $80 million of Maguire Thomas' purchase for 10 
years at a favorable interest rate. Maguire Thomas will pay an interest rate 
equal to what the state earns on its cash investments, currently 8.3%. 
</P>
<P>
After unsuccessful negotiations with Summa, Davis said, prospects for the 
wetlands deal improved dramatically when Maguire Thomas stepped in last year. 
Since then, Maguire Thomas has abandoned Summa's design for Playa Vista and 
come up with a totally different project proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an ardent critic of the Summa design, steadfastly refused to take a 
position on what should happen with the new Playa Vista project. "The fate of 
the remainder of the property is a matter that is up to the city, the county 
and the Coastal Commission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not mention that part of the two-inch-thick agreement that provides that 
the controller's office will assist Maguire Thomas in obtaining approval for 
development of the 70 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The property will not change hands until Feb. 15, to allow time for final 
settlement of the wetlands lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, who strongly opposed the Summa project when she ran for election 
three years ago, also refused to take a firm position on Playa Vista until 
environmental impact studies are complete. 
</P>
<P>
But the first-term councilwoman said she was thrilled at the wetlands deal. "It 
represents an agreement between all kinds of different people who typically 
fight with one another," she said. "Had this not happened, nothing else would 
have happened for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLAYA VISTA PROJECT DEAL 
</P>
<P>
A complex deal between the state and the developer of the vast Playa Vista 
project will provide permanent protection for an additional 60 acres of the 
Ballona Wetlands south of marina del Rey. As part of the agreement, the state 
is selling 70 acres of prime property north of Ballona Creek to the developer, 
Maguire Thomas Partners, fro $85 million. The deal will remove a major obstacle 
to construction of Playa Vista, one of the biggest developments in Los Angeles 
history

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN DRIVE-BY KILLING; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: THE MAN, 19, IS HELD ON SUSPICION OF MURDER. SIX OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN 
THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT ATTACK IN LONG BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Long Beach police Thursday arrested a 19-year-old man who they believe sprayed 
the sidewalk of a quiet neighborhood with more than a dozen rounds of gunfire 
in a drive-by attack, killing at least one reputed gang rival and injuring six 
others in the latest incident in the city's record escalation of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by an eyewitness, police arrested Jacob Brevard, 19, of Long Beach, a 
suspected gang member, at about noon on suspicion of murder. Brevard, whose 
photograph was among those compiled by Southland law enforcement officials of 
suspected gang members, was apprehended at his home without a struggle after he 
was identified by the witness, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were attempting to identify the driver in the Wednesday night attack 
and two others who may have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty good-sized drive-by," Investigator Ron Pavek said Thursday. 
"I'm really very surprised there weren't more dead. The guy must have been a 
terrible shot." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, administrators at Dominguez Medical Center -- directly across the 
street from the shooting scene in the 100 block of West Bort Street -- asserted 
that there was at least one more fatality. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two people here dead on arrival from this incident," hospital 
spokeswoman Janis Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other victims were also brought to the hospital with gunshot wounds but 
apparently fled the emergency room before treatment, she reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police stood by their death count, identifying the victim as Laron Randolph, 
21, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded, Ronnie Davis, 29, was in critical condition at Long Beach 
Memorial Hospital with six gunshot wounds in the legs and hips from what police 
believe was an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief hospital interview, Davis said he and about seven friends were 
talking on the sidewalk outside his mother's house, "just having a few beers" 
when the violence erupted shortly after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was getting ready to go home when all of a sudden, a yellow Firebird 
or a Camaro comes by and started firing," Davis said. "I just seen the bullets 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his group was targeted, Davis said: "I have no idea. I'm not in a 
gang. I work every day." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Valencia Walker, said Davis is an electrician in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he did not recognize any of the four men in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not interview Davis on Thursday but, told of his statement, Pavek 
said: "He's a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Investigator Tim Cable said the dress, activities and profiles of the 
seven victims in the drive-by shooting make it clear to him that all were gang 
members, or associated with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them (about gang affiliations) and they say: 'We don't bang.' But if 
you look like a duck and you quack like a duck, but you don't admit to being a 
duck, then what are you?" Cable asked. 
</P>
<P>
"These people don't really like to cooperate with us even though they're the 
victims," the investigator added. "That's the coldhearted fact of life for the 
gangsters. Even if they knew who did it, they wouldn't tell us because they'd 
want to get them themselves. That's the way they operate." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they heard rapid gunshots -- said by police to number at least 
20 -- and saw four men in a car racing away from the scene, leaving behind a 
slew of bloodied bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just lying there on the bed and I heard the shooting -- lots of it," 
said Helen Wright, who lives next door to the attack scene. "It scared me. I 
just got up and ran to the back of the house for protection. You could still 
smell the smoke from the guns." 
</P>
<P>
Never targeted before for gang attacks, the north Long Beach neighborhood may 
be only the latest example of the spread of gang violence in the coastal city, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
No current crime figures were available Thursday. But department officials said 
they are on a pace to break last year's record homicide total -- when a 47% 
increase over the previous year, to 97 -- gave the city the dubious distinction 
of having the biggest jump in serious crimes of any metropolitan area in the 
state.

HOLDEN SEEKS REGISTRATION OF ROLEX WATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to halt a rash of violent Rolex watch thefts, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Nate Holden on Thursday said he will introduce an ordinance 
requiring buyers of the luxury timepieces to register the serial number with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said registration would make it difficult for crooks to sell purloined 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance also would place a "five-day waiting period" on the sale 
of any second-hand Rolex and would require pawnshop operators to check the 
serial numbers of Rolexes with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If a robber is made aware that he can no longer steal . . . a Rolex watch for 
profit, then there will be no incentive to do so," said Holden in a City Hall 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Rolex watches, which sell for a few thousand dollars to more than $100,000, 
have increasingly become a target for crime in recent months, culminating in 
August when the Los Angeles Police Department reported that such thefts 
occurred at the rate of one a day. Several Southland Rolex owners have been 
killed in theft attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim trend, police and jewelers who specialize in the expensive 
watches were lukewarm to Holden's proposal. "We applaud his effort to further 
get a handle on this," said Lt. Fred Nixon, a spokesman for the LAPD. "But we 
have some doubt about the value of such a system." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said most owners of such expensive watches already register them with 
insurance companies, and the LAPD's pawnshop detail checks serial-numbered 
items against theft reports. 
</P>
<P>
Even Holden acknowledged another problem with the proposal: thieves could 
simply sell their ill-gotten wares in a neighboring city to avoid the Los 
Angeles law altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Stone, chief of security for the Rolex Authorized Service Center in Los 
Angeles, said the Holden proposal was ludicrous. It would be impossible to 
check with the LAPD every time a watch comes in for repair, he said, adding 
that most Rolex service centers already work closely with law enforcement 
agencies to identify stolen watches. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with the proposal, Stone said, is that many Rolex owners would 
be apprehensive to add their names and addresses to any list of valuable goods. 
"How would you know whose hands such a list could fall into," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN OKD TO MAKE COUNTY WORKERS PAY FOR 
PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors have adopted a controversial plan that will, for 
the first time, require employees to pay for parking in the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Parking fees of from $70 to $225 are scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1. Each 
county employee, however, will receive $70 monthly to help offset the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was developed to meet South Coast Air Quality Management District 
requirements that large employers take steps to reduce the number of workplace 
trips to relieve traffic congestion and reduce air pollution.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNION STRESSES BILINGUAL SKILLS OF TEACHER 
AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report released Thursday by a union representing 10,000 teacher assistants 
threatening to strike asserts that they are the vital link in the effort to 
educate the one in three students who speak English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-page "white paper" is designed to increase public understanding of the 
assistants' role in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where only 5% of 
teachers are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, 68% of teaching assistants are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
The TAs, college students who work three to six hours a day, are using their 
language skills to bolster their contract demands. "TAs are the only district 
employees who do not receive any medical benefits, sick leave, holidays, or 
vacation," said John Tanner, staff director for Service Employees Union, Local 
99, which is representing the TAs in their first contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The TAs, who make $9.44 a hour, want the district to increase their wages and 
give them the same benefits given to other employees.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL BACKS FIRST STEP ON FREEWAY EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving from pencil to pavement, the staff of the California Transportation 
Commission has recommended approval of a crucial first step in the 
controversial extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Despite bitter objections from local officials and South Pasadena residents, 
transportation officials recommended that the commission earmark $4.8 million 
in a new master building plan to begin right-of-way acquisition for completion 
of the heavily traveled roadway between the Foothill Freeway and Valley 
Boulevard in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the staff recommended -- and the commission is expected to approve 
-- this first step toward completing the gap, it is far from becoming reality. 
Still to be completed is the environmental process and a detailed plan of how 
and where the roadway will be built, commission officials said.

2 ELEMENTS PIVOTAL IN CUTTING RAIDER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the tortuous process by which Raiders owner Al Davis eventually signed a 
contract to keep his football team in Los Angeles, two elements stand out. 
</P>
<P>
First, the city had certain natural advantages in the bidding war with Oakland, 
Sacramento and Irwindale. The expected sales value alone of planned luxury 
boxes in the Los Angeles Coliseum could reach $12 million a year, and millions 
more could be realized in a renovated stadium by selling elite club seating. 
The prices that could be charged would be considerably higher than in smaller 
cities with fewer corporate headquarters or wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Even without accounting for the eventual pay television potential, the 
long-term opportunities for profit in Los Angeles are greater by far. The city, 
a world entertainment center, is also a much more prestigious place for any 
team to play. 
</P>
<P>
Was there ever a real chance, for instance, that Davis would give up all that 
to take a flyer on Sacramento? No less a Sacramento civic booster than Gregg 
Lukenbill, chief arranger of the Sacramento bid, in the end came to feel that 
the answer was no. 
</P>
<P>
But the second element that stands out is that with all these advantages, Los 
Angeles had to overcome considerable handicaps as well. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Coliseum was the only playing site the city could offer, and in 
its existing form it had neither luxury boxes nor club seats, making it 
positively antiquated by modern National Football League standards. Moreover, 
it was administered by a faction-ridden commission representing three levels of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when the bidding war for the Raiders began, the Coliseum 
Commission was led by developer Alexander Haagen, who was not even on speaking 
terms with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the commission had few financial assets of its own, and its 
ability to secure assistance from the city, the county and the state 
simultaneously, as would have been required, was next to nil. Even had the 
commission been unified, which it wasn't, it would have been at a disadvantage. 
As it was, most of its members did not even like football. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, things did not begin to come together for Los Angeles until 
local politicians, including Mayor Tom Bradley, City Council President John 
Ferraro and City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, had the idea to privatize the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
This, they reasoned, would put the responsibility for coming up with renovation 
plans and the money to finance them, as well as the large cash payments Davis 
was demanding, on a private business team that had the wherewithal to bring 
together what the commission could not. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, Sacramento and Irwindale all came to rely substantially on public 
money in making their bids. Los Angeles, using private business as it did 
during the 1984 Olympic effort, would avoid that necessity, and much of the 
political controversy that went with it. Even the faces of the negotiators 
would change. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, it proved more difficult than expected to secure a capable 
private bidder. Months passed before the Coliseum Commission was willing to 
grant the businessmen independent authority to make a bid. After this was done, 
one of the original partners, MCA Inc., quit the partnership. The other, 
Spectacor Management Group, had to overcome internal divisions before it was 
able to make a serious offer. 
</P>
<P>
As these problems arose, Bradley become more involved. Dissatisfied with the 
efforts of his appointees on the Coliseum Commission, the mayor brought back a 
former commissioner, labor leader William R. Robertson, and made him and Deputy 
Mayor Mark Fabiani his point men. 
</P>
<P>
Their job, assisted at key moments by the mayor himself, was to push the 
parties together as best they could, cajole the Spectacor executives into 
making ever more substantial offers, and encourage Davis to reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
By then, as the summer wound toward a close, the timing was right. Irwindale 
and Sacramento had long since fallen by the wayside. The second Oakland bid was 
much less substantial than the first, and Oakland authorities were having 
trouble settling on the terms of that smaller offer. The private Los Angeles 
bid ended up higher than Oakland's. 
</P>
<P>
And Davis, facing a new season with the Los Angeles fans turned off by the long 
uncertainty, wanted to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement that has been reached faces obstacles. There are complicated 
environmental and preservation requirements to be met before work on the 
revamped Coliseum can begin. Financing must be obtained. Further interventions 
by the mayor and his point men may be necessary to be sure Spectacor can 
perform, and it is possible additional partners may yet have to be brought in. 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, Los Angeles has secured the Raiders.

PLAN TO REWARD DRUG-FREE STUDENTS AROUSES CONCERN; 
</P>
<P>
PREVENTION: ANTELOPE VALLEY 'CLUB' THAT WOULD OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO 
YOUTHS FACES CRITICS WHO QUESTION ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND THREATS TO CIVIL 
RIGHTS.

<P>
A proposal under which Antelope Valley high school students would be rewarded 
financially by local businesses for taking voluntary tests showing them to be 
drug free is being attacked by critics as ineffective and a threat to civil 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "drug-free youth" program, which has been carried out in other 
states but never before in California, has gained support from Antelope Valley 
political, business and educational leaders since it was suggested two weeks 
ago by Billy Pricer, a minister and retired sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, students with membership cards -- granted after the youths 
passed random drug tests -- would be given discounts on clothing, movies, food 
and other goods and services by participating merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Pricer, who runs several anti-drug and gang programs that have received 
Lancaster and Palmdale city funds, has asked the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District to help sign up students and administer urine tests in the 
schools. School board members will discuss the issue next week as Pricer 
continues fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said Thursday that they believe the involvement of the schools is 
inappropriate and that they plan to challenge the proposal at next week's 
school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition has come from black leaders -- who say the program could lead to 
harassment of minority students who do not join -- and members of the medical 
community. Some who run drug treatment programs say they regard the idea of a 
"drug-free club" complete with identification cards, discounts and other 
rewards as a waste of anti-drug resources. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a superficial approach to a complex problem," said Sue Crimin, 
spokeswoman for the Road to Recovery, a chemical dependency program at Antelope 
Valley Hospital Medical Center. "I'd rather see the resources used for therapy 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Samuel Hooker, president of the Antelope Valley chapter of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said he believes students 
who choose not to take part will be harassed and stigmatized. He also said the 
proposal is part of a backlash against black and Latino teen-agers in a 
fast-growing community alarmed by increasing gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that this would infringe on people's rights," Hooker said. "This is 
what I consider Big Brother tactics. . . . The root of this stems from some 
sort of prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Pricer responded: "I see no basis for a statement like that. I believe it is so 
fallacious and ridiculous that I would not even lend any credibility to the 
comment. Drugs have no racial lines." 
</P>
<P>
Pricer said he was inspired by the Drug Free Youth in Texas program in Smith 
County, Tex., where as many as 95% of students in some schools have joined 
drug-free clubs in the last three years. But some parents, students and civil 
liberties groups in those communities objected, saying students who chose not 
to join were unfairly stigmatized as drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents in the Antelope Valley raise similar objections. 
</P>
<P>
NAACP spokesman Mike Kirkland said, "We feel compelled on the behalf of the 
youth in our community to oppose even the concept that this is the most 
effective way to fight drug use." 
</P>
<P>
Pricer called the criticism exasperating. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be voluntary," he said of his proposed program. "Anybody who knows me 
and has followed my track record knows what my motivations are. Who's going to 
complain next, drug dealers saying their rights have been violated?"

MIKE DOWNEY: FEAR OF FAILURE MAKES TUCKER SUCCESS AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Tucker might be the most dominant lineman in college football, but he 
never could have played for the University of Miami. He doesn't brag enough. He 
won't gloat about how good he is. Instead, the USC guard speaks of things some 
270-pound, All-American football players would be too insecure to discuss -- 
like his insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
Take his fear of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when I was living in Texas, when I was -- what? -- 7 or 8, I'm sitting in 
my living room watching TV when a news flash comes on saying that some guy 
nearby just got struck by lightning, right while he was out playing football. 
That just freaked me out. 
</P>
<P>
"Later on, I came to realize that anybody can be struck by lightning, anytime, 
anywhere. But at that age, you're real impressionable. I thought it was playing 
football that could get you hit by lightning -- you know, standing out there 
that way in an open field. My opponent never scared me, but the sky'd get dark 
and I'd start looking up. 
</P>
<P>
"Gave me the willies." 
</P>
<P>
He can laugh about it now. Penn State, coming Saturday to the Coliseum, 
unnerves Tucker considerably more than cumulus clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it never even rains out here," he said. "We used to have hurricanes 
blowing in off the Gulf Coast. Texas A&amp;M and Alabama canceled their game 
one year because of that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take California. All we got is earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
If there is one subject Tucker, a Navy brat, knows, it's geography. His family 
has lived in Alaska, in Brooklyn, in Japan, in Dallas and in the Pacific 
Northwest, beneath weather balloons, across from air strips and alongside 
shipyards. Mark can still recall seeing his mother drape green military 
blankets over the windows of their home in Kodiak to blot out six months of 
nonstop Alaskan sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
After his father retired from the service and his parents separated, Tucker 
dropped anchor at Banning High School in Los Angeles, helped win two City 
championships, then went to USC to become All-American by his junior year, 
principal bodyguard to Todd Marinovich and one of 12 announced candidates for 
this season's Lombardi Trophy, symbolizing college football's top lineman. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder he excels as a pulling guard. Mark's been pulling his whole life. 
He's a mover and a shaker. 
</P>
<P>
Running interference is his favorite thing. In fact, Tucker is still tingling 
over an escort block he made in the Syracuse game on opening night. Early on, 
USC ran an option play. Ricky Ervins took a pitch. Tucker took a look. He 
spotted a little cornerback with big ideas. He hit him like lightning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit, that one felt good," he said. "That one gave me a thrill. I 
got back to the bench, and guys were saying, 'Whoa, man! You killed that little 
sucker!' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tucker is not overconfident. If anything, he is refreshingly 
underconfident. 
</P>
<P>
While watching an NFL game on television the other day involving the New York 
Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles, Tucker was reminded, even at 270 pounds, 
not to get too big for his britches. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging by what I saw, I'd better be thinking about getting bigger and getting 
better," he said. "You see Reggie White or Jerome Brown coming at you, you'd 
better brace yourself. Courtney Hall from the San Diego Chargers is somebody I 
know, and he weighed 230 in high school. He's 280 now. There's food for thought 
right there. I was in the Ram locker room once, saw Jackie Slater and some of 
them. These people are enormous!" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker himself is in fine shape. His body fat is way down from a year ago. He 
replaced the 20 pounds he lost when tonsillitis kept him out of spring 
practice. He continues to be USC's strongest man, bench-pressing 415 pounds. 
Yet, he is so quick, they say he runs 40 yards in 4.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Larry Smith considered Tucker to be so invaluable to USC's line, he said 
before the season: "Everything will be built around him." It scared both coach 
and player at Tuesday's practice when Tucker suffered a pinched nerve in his 
neck, causing his arm to go numb. But Tucker said he expects to play against 
Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
What motivates him as a football player? Few linemen are as straightforward as 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of failure," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
What motivated him to become a football player in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I didn't want to be a mama's boy forever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sensitivity here -- that of a strong young man who doesn't want to 
come on too strong. Tucker mentions that the day next May when he obtains his 
degree at USC will be the day his mother's life is complete. Then he catches 
himself in time to say: "Not that her life has been incomplete up to now." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tucker, on guard. 
</P>
<P>
Around football you run into so many guys who think they are such hot stuff. 
Maybe that's why people enjoy USC offensive line coach John Matsko's story 
about Tucker's first collegiate start. 
</P>
<P>
Against California in 1987, the first time Tucker came back from the field, he 
yanked Matsko's shirt. The coach had no time for this. But Tucker kept tugging 
until Matsko finally could ignore him no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark, what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, coach!" Tucker said. "I can play college football!" 
</P>
<P>
"That's good, Mark," the coach said. "That's why we put you in there."

Bret Johnson.

But Penn State and Sacca have proven to be a volatile mix. Sack-a Tony, it has 
been suggested to Coach Joe Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has started 16 of 24 games since his arrival in Happy Valley -- 
including the last 10 games of an 8-3-1 season a year ago -- Sacca has 
statistics considered mediocre even for a player who hadn't been as highly 
touted. 
</P>
<P>
In his first two seasons, 6-foot-5, 218-pound Sacca completed 38.9% of his 
passes and threw as many interceptions -- 10 -- as he did touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the Penn State media guide, it says, "Sacca has outstanding natural 
ability, but has to work hard on his mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
Admits Sacca, who will lead the Nittany Lions against USC Saturday at the 
Coliseum: "I have been kind of erratic." 
</P>
<P>
Take last Saturday, when Sacca misfired on all eight of his third-quarter pass 
attempts in Penn State's opener against Texas, then rallied the Nittany Lions 
in the fourth quarter, completing eight of 14 passes for 135 yards on three 
long drives. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State lost, 17-13, but only after kicker Henry Adkins missed a 31-yard 
field-goal attempt with 5:16 left and Sacca's pass from the Texas 20-yard line 
on the last play of the game fell incomplete in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Sacca's final numbers: 13 for 32 for 243 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
While not extraordinary, his yardage was a career high. And only once 
previously had he completed as many as 13 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
When Sacca suggested to a reporter that Penn State's conservative, 
ground-oriented approach limited a quarterback's effectiveness, Paterno invited 
him to inspect superior statistics compiled by former Nittany Lion quarterbacks 
with inferior talent. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sacca said, Penn State's offense is geared to the tailback, and "you 
don't really get to pass until it's (in) desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Donoghue, Sacca's coach at Delran High School, is empathic. 
</P>
<P>
"Their style of play is tough on a quarterback," Donoghue said. "Their style of 
play is not conducive to a quarterback looking great. Their philosophy is: No. 
1, they're going to play great defense, and No. 2, they're going to have a 
kicking game that's not going to hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
"And No. 3, offensively, they're going to wear you down, and in the fourth 
quarter, the game is going to be theirs. But they no longer have those dominant 
teams that can just steamroll people." 
</P>
<P>
The situation, Donoghue said, has created friction between Sacca and Paterno, 
who is in his 25th season as Penn State's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is very demanding of his quarterbacks, with little tolerance for 
idiosyncrasies or variations in abilities, and I don't think he's been very 
patient with Tony," Donoghue said. "I think they made a big mistake when they 
didn't redshirt him his freshman year, and I think they made a bigger mistake 
when they didn't redshirt him last year. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, he suffered from it, so the relationship has been strained at 
times. He's very, very critical of Tony, but I don't see them doing the kind of 
things that would give the kid a whole lot of confidence, other than the fact 
they keep rolling him out there each week." 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue said that Sacca is more dangerous when throwing on the run, as he did 
as a senior at Delran High, when he passed for 1,665 yards and 24 touchdowns 
while completing 54.5% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
Delran was unbeaten, and Sacca attracted recruiters from around the country, 
making trips to Notre Dame, Michigan, Penn State and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
He chose Penn State mainly because it was only about a 3 1/2-hour drive from 
his home on the outskirts of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
After the three quarterbacks listed ahead of him on the depth chart -- Tom 
Bill, Lance Lonergan and Doug Sieg -- were injured, Sacca was a starter only 
four games into his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
No freshman quarterback had ever started for Paterno, and Sacca, only a few 
months removed from high school, wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
A starter for five games before Lonergan returned, Sacca completed 37% of his 
passes for 821 yards and four touchdowns, with five interceptions. Penn State 
wound up 5-6, its first losing season under Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sacca wasn't a starter until Bill, cited by campus police for 
public drunkenness, was suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
Sacca, called upon in the third week of the season, passed for only 694 yards 
and six touchdowns, with five interceptions, but Penn State rebounded to 8-3-1 
and outlasted Brigham Young, 50-39, for a Holiday Bowl victory last December in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Although overshadowed by BYU's Ty Detmer, who passed for 576 yards, Sacca 
enjoyed his best game of the season against the Cougars, completing 10 of 20 
passes for 206 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His younger brother, John, also a quarterback from Delran High, was signed by 
Penn State last winter, so Tony couldn't have felt too badly about the 
direction of his collegiate career. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Donoghue said, "I think there's always a question in his mind (of), 
'What if I'd gone to a place that throws the ball a little bit more regularly 
and with a little bit more varied passing game?' " 
</P>
<P>
If so, Sacca won't admit it. "I haven't really had great stats, and some people 
have been a little disappointed, but I've played a lot of games (and) gotten a 
lot of experience," he said. "Hopefully, it will pay off for me this year and 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
His final quarter against Texas, at least, was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's getting better," Paterno said. "He had a pretty good game, 
really, under a lot of pressure. He's still not as consistent as I would like 
him to be, but I think he's gotten much better, and he made a couple of big 
league throws to get us back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Sacca insists that he has enjoyed his stay at Penn State. "It hasn't been bad," 
he said. "I don't have any complaints. If things don't work out in the next two 
years, then maybe I will have some complaints."

<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: HE COULD CATCH THE BALL, BUT HE COULDN'T KEEP IT, FUMBLING THREE 
TIMES IN GREEN BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can pardon him, please, but Henry Ellard does not particularly savor 
rewinding his mind back to Lambeau Field five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fumbles can humble, and the memories of them do not improve with the passing of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Having signed a three-year deal worth about $2.8 million four days earlier, 
Ellard caught six of Jim Everett's passes in Sunday's season opener but fumbled 
half of those receptions in a second-half dropfest. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers recovered two of the fumbles, the last one resulting in 
the touchdown that put the game out of the Rams' reach in a 36-24 setback. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into Sunday's game at Tampa, it is forgive-and-forget time in Ramland. 
Ellard is doing the forgetting, his teammates the forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about it anymore," Ellard said of his slippery Sunday. "It's 
just a fluke thing that happened. It's pretty much done and over with. So I 
don't give it a second thought at all. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think about it because I don't do it very often. So, 'OK, yeah, it 
happened. Don't give it a second thought.' " 
</P>
<P>
Packer game? What Packer game? 
</P>
<P>
Ellard, of course, is a proven player, a two-time Pro Bowl receiver who caught 
156 passes for 18 touchdowns in the last two seasons. He has not had very many 
games in his eight-year career to compare with his last. 
</P>
<P>
"To fumble the ball three times in a game . . . I don't know if I've fumbled 
three times in my career, let alone three times in one game," Ellard said. 
"That's definitely about as bad a game as I could've had." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard still caught those six passes for 106 yards -- the third-best yardage 
total in the NFC last week -- so clearly he was getting open and catching the 
ball when it was thrown to him. He just wasn't hanging onto it. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was his day to experience the pain of letting his team down, and his 
teammates seem to know that Ellard, given the laws of average and his pride, is 
not likely to fumble again soon. Especially this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, I think he's probably looking forward to it for redemption," said 
Flipper Anderson, Ellard's running mate. "Just to show people that fumbling's 
just something that you really don't do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those snowball effects. It just happened that game, and 
we're not going to go into this game worrying about fumbling at all." 
</P>
<P>
And the guy who threw those balls Ellard fumbled says he isn't about to stop 
pumping them to Ellard as long as he is open. Maybe even if he's not. 
</P>
<P>
After all Ellard has done, why stop after a one-game nightmare? 
</P>
<P>
"We kept doing it, didn't we?" Everett said. "We kept bringing the ball right 
back to him." 
</P>
<P>
"Henry brings an explosive asset to this ballclub, and it was just a one-time 
blowup. It was a freak-of-nature type of deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it ruined anybody's confidence in him, and I'll throw it to him 
this week, and hopefully the outcome will be different." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard barely played during the Rams' four exhibitions because of a sore 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those days," Ellard said. "You hope it wouldn't happen, but 
it just did. That's all. If anything, it's lack of contact in the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
And he says fans who have watched him over the last two seasons know that he 
doesn't have to prove that he is not going to fumble every time he touches the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"They know it's not going to happen like it did," Ellard said. "It's one of 
those games where it happens. I'm not even concerned because I know it's not 
going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to play like I've been playing, and then it's just a matter of 
holding onto the ball when the contact comes. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was dropping the balls, it'd have been different. But I was catching 
them, then fumbling. It wasn't like I was carrying it with one hand or anything 
-- it was just good tackling, swiping at the ball and knocking it loose." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who caught five passes for 128 yards and a touchdown (and no 
fumbles), says he can understand exactly what Ellard went through Sunday -- and 
knows that there are no real explanations for it. 
</P>
<P>
All a receiver can do, he says, is move on and make sure the next catch is not 
the next fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"You kind of feel for him, but I'm not really concerned about it," Anderson 
said. "Catching the ball and tucking it away is really not something that you 
work on. It just kind of comes as second nature. 
</P>
<P>
"You catch the ball, put it away. If you look at our films the past two years, 
we rarely fumble at all, if at all. It's just one of those things. Probably 
won't see us fumble any more the rest of the year -- knock on wood."

TRADE FOR COOK FILLS A NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In strengthening their bullpen and guarding against a depleted starting 
rotation, the Dodgers acquired left-handed pitcher Dennis Cook from the 
Philadelphia Phillies Thursday for catching prospect Darrin Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 27, had an 8-3 record with a 3.56 earned-run average in 13 starts and 29 
relief appearances for the Phillies in his second major league season. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was 5-2 as a starter, with a shutout, two complete games and a 
3.59 ERA, he was moved to the Phillies' bullpen because they had three other 
left-handed starters. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to contend for a starting spot with the Dodgers next spring and 
could be a starter again as soon as Tuesday in Atlanta, if Mike Hartley's sore 
left side does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
"The trainers have told me that there is certainly some doubt as to Mike's 
ability to make his next start," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. 
"Ironically, Dennis last pitched on Tuesday, when Mike pitched, so he could 
fill a role for us right away." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who bats left-handed, hit .291 at triple-A Albuquerque with 13 homers 
and 65 runs batted in. He was hitless in one at-bat with the Dodgers this 
season but had four hits in eight at-bats last year, including a home run and 
two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers could part with him because he had no immediate future with the 
club as a backup to left-handed hitting Mike Scioscia. If the Dodgers do not 
re-sign Rick Dempsey, next year's backup probably will be right-handed hitting 
Carlos Hernandez 
</P>
<P>
"To have two left-handed hitting catchers, that's not a good match," Claire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Claire hopes Cook will nail down a spot either in the bullpen, which lacks 
sound left-handers, or in the starting rotation, which is far from set for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher may not be recovered from shoulder surgery. And 
left-hander Fernando Valenzuela, who has engaged in sometimes bitter 
negotiations throughout his career, may not be offered the minimum of $2.5 
million that it would take to keep him here. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, can we be deep enough to afford the unexpected?" Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
He would not say if the Dodgers were viewing Cook as a long-term starter or 
reliever, admitting only that, "In the short term, his role will be a matter of 
need, while in the long term it will be a matter of evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda was scouting the Cincinnati Reds in their game against 
Houston Thursday night and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," Cook told reporters about the trade, his second in 15 months. 
"But I guess I never fit into (the Phillies') plans down the line. Just to get 
into a pennant race is a nice feeling. . . . I don't know how many games behind 
(the Dodgers) are, but they obviously think they are still in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Being 8-3 is nothing to sneeze at. I just hope I can go there and pitch well."

The Atlantic Coast Conference voted Thursday to invite Florida State to join 
the eight-team league. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the details of membership will be communicated to Florida State 
over the next few days, but no deadline has been set for a decision by the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conference has deliberated at length about expansion," ACC Commissioner 
Gene Corrigan said. "The process has been comprehensive and thorough. We feel 
comfortable this decision is in the best interests of the member institutions 
of the ACC." 
</P>
<P>
Corrigan said Florida State had been an attractive candidate from the outset. 
"The more we learned about the institution, the more we felt they were a 
natural fit," he said. "Their academic and athletic programs are nationally 
recognized, and their addition would be a plus to our conference in every way. 
It would allow us to continue in a leadership position in intercollegiate 
athletics." 
</P>
<P>
ACC members are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, North 
Carolina State, Clemson and Georgia Tech.

SUPPLEMENTARY DERBY ENTRIES TO BE ALLOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE AUSTIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kentucky Derby was opened to supplementary entries as a result of 
adjustments made in the Triple Crown conditions announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to address criticism of the Triple Crown, particularly the point 
system for two rich bonuses, the operators of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and 
Belmont Stakes made several changes. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest will permit supplementary nominations at entry time, two days 
before the Derby. Supplementary nominations have not been allowed in the Derby 
in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, to bypass a January or April nomination deadline, an owner 
would have to pay $150,000 to get his horse eligible on the day entries are 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
The $150,000, which would go into the Derby purse, also would make the horse 
eligible for the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. If an owner waited until the 
Preakness to supplement, he would have to pay only $100,000, which also would 
open the Belmont to him. 
</P>
<P>
A supplementary entry to the Belmont will cost $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Horses had been supplemented for years to the Preakness and Belmont, but that 
provision was dropped starting with the 1986 Triple Crown, when the three races 
were joined for nomination purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"After review and analysis of the nomination procedures, and discussions with 
horsemen and the media, we felt the extension of the late nomination deadline 
and allowing supplements give horsemen every possible chance to be in the 
Triple Crown races," said Ed Seigenfeld, executive director of Triple Crown 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
The Derby's prohibition of supplemental entries may have had one of its biggest 
impacts in 1980. That year, Codex won the Santa Anita Derby but was not 
nominated for the Kentucky Derby and had to skip the race. Codex had been 
nominated for the Preakness and won at Pimlico Race Course. He also had been 
nominated for the Belmont Stakes, in which he ran seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Triple Crown's point system -- involving a $1 million bonus for the 
best performance in all three races -- has been altered. 
</P>
<P>
Points had been awarded on a 5-3-1 basis. The new scoring will be based on a 
10-5-3-1 system. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the new system, a horse that wins two races has to finish in a tie for 
the bonus," Seigenfeld said. "Under the new system, Alysheba would have gotten 
the $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
Unchanged is the $5-million Chrysler Triple Crown Challenge, which guarantees 
that amount to any horse winning all three races. The guarantee amounts to a 
bonus of about $2.5 million because the $1 million bonus and the three purses 
would be deducted before the payoff is made.

OLYMPIANS TO GET TIME TO BREATHE

<TEXT>
<P>
It has long been said, only somewhat in jest, that the U.S. Olympic trials 
constitute the toughest swim meet in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Andy Coan. The world record-holder in the 100-meter freestyle in 1975, 
he did not qualify for the Olympic team in 1976. For that matter, he didn't 
make the eight-man field for the trials final. 
</P>
<P>
The limit on entries, two per event, and the depth of U.S. swimming conspire to 
make the U.S. trials more difficult than the Olympic Games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That is expected to change at the U.S. Swimming Convention in Pittsburgh next 
week when the 600-member House of Delegates votes to confirm March 1-6 as the 
dates for the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the U.S. team was selected only three or four weeks before the 
Olympic Games. The March dates, an adaptation of the Australian system, will 
give the team almost four months of training together before the 1992 Games in 
Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the old system, some coaches believed, was that to make the 
highly competitive U.S. team, swimmers were tapering -- easing up on their 
training and shaving their body hair -- for the trials, then repeating the 
process a few weeks later for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The second time, many believe, the taper doesn't take as effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes such a big effort just to make the team and then we were asking them 
to bounce back for the Games a month later," said Doug Ingram, date selection 
chairman. "It's tough to come off that emotional high from the trials that 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
But some coaches contend that the early selection process penalizes the "hot" 
swimmer, the one who peaks at the trials and continues to pick up speed through 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram believes that sacrifice will have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel what's best for the group outweighs the potential loss of an 
individual who comes on at the last minute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new system also has a major impact on collegiate swimming, since the trials 
will be held three to four weeks before the women's and men's NCAA Division I 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take some focus away from the NCAA championships, but what came across 
in our meetings with college and club coaches is that in an Olympic year they 
are willing to put aside their local concerns and put the focus on the national 
concern," said Ingram, who coaches the men's team at Southern Illinois 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The conference championship meets will be affected even more, since potential 
Olympians won't taper for them. Instead, they will train hard up to and during 
the conference meets so that they can taper before the Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some conferences, including the Pac-10 and the Southeastern, are 
considering moving their conference meets from March, 1992, to December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"That takes the pressure off an individual who might feel that he was letting 
his team down by focusing on the Olympic trials," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
The system will be tested in January. For the first time, the U.S. picked a 
national team several months in advance. The World Championships team was 
selected in early August and will compete Jan. 7-11 in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mission Bay swimming program appeared on the scene in 1985 by hiring 
away Mark Schubert from the Mission Viejo Nadadores, it appeared to be 
patterning itself after a Nadador program that had won 44 national team titles. 
The club, in Boca Raton, Fla., had the facilities, the funding and the coaching 
to attract swimmers from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years later, it lost Schubert to the University of Texas women's 
program and the affiliated Longhorn club. Now his successor, Steve Bultman, an 
assistant on the 1988 Olympic team, is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Mission Bay is probably the best training facility in the 
country, but I do think coaching changes have not had a stabilizing effect," 
Schubert said. "It is not on as solid a footing as it appeared to be at the 
beginning. The budget cuts have hurt. It never lived up to the dream it was 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Schubert's Longhorn club is up to 250 members, an increase of 40. More swimmers 
are expected with the recent addition of a satellite facility, a 50-meter pool 
in the Circle C section of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Fla., and Oklahoma City are vying to be the 
host of the 1992 Olympic trials, although late bids will be accepted before the 
voting at the U.S. Swimming convention Sept. 23 in Pittsburgh. . . . Voting 
will be held there for performance of the year. Tom Jager and Mike Barrowman, 
the only U.S. swimmers to set world records in 1990, appear to be the best 
bets. Jager, the former UCLA star, lowered the 50-meter freestyle mark twice on 
March 24 in Nashville with a final clocking of 21.81 seconds. Barrowman 
bettered the mark he set in August 1989 in Tokyo by a whopping 1.36 seconds, 
the most improvement of the 200 breaststroke record since 1976. . . . Finalists 
for swimmer of the year are Barrowman, Jager, Matt Biondi , Janet Evans, Melvin 
Stewart, Eric Namesnik, Leigh Ann Fetter and Nicole Haislett. Jon Urbanchek of 
the University of Michigan, formerly coach at Cal State Long Beach, was named 
coach of the year by the American Swimming Coaches Assn. at itsconvention last 
week in Washington. Urbanchek is credited with having developed Barrowman. . . 
. Olympic gold medalist Mark Spitz is at the Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., for tests at the International Center for Aquatic 
Research. Spitz plans to swim in the flume, the only swimming treadmill in the 
Western Hemisphere. His stroke efficiency and swimming economy, a gauge of how 
efficiently he uses oxygen, will be measured and compared to future tests. . . 
. On Saturday, Spitz and members of Indiana's six NCAA championship teams, 1968 
through '73, will meet in Bloomington, Ind., for a reunion.

MATER DEI TO BE INVESTIGATED ON SPARKS MATTER; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: SOUTHERN SECTION QUESTIONS QUICK ENROLLMENT OF TRANSFERS FROM 
MONTCLAIR PREP. 
</P>

<P>
Four days after football players Derek and Leland Sparks transferred from Van 
Nuys Montclair Prep to Santa Ana Mater Dei High, Stan Thomas, commissioner of 
the CIF Southern Section, said Thursday he is investigating the Mater Dei 
athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he questioned how two non-Catholics could get into Mater Dei, a 
Catholic high school, at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear Mater Dei is giving special treatment to athletes," Thomas 
said. "I'm concerned with why they let these athletes in." 
</P>
<P>
The Sparks, who are cousins, withdrew from Montclair Prep last Tuesday, 
contacted Mater Dei Wednesday and enrolled Monday. Derek practiced with the 
football team all week. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Mater Dei's history played a role in prompting the investigation. 
The school was put on probation without sanctions by the Southern Section for 
the 1988-89 school year for illegal inducements in the transfer of Corona del 
Mar quarterback Dan O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that Derek and Leland didn't receive any preferential 
treatment here," said Lyle Porter, Mater Dei's first-year principal. "If two 
non-athletes would have come in at the same time as Derek and Leland, we would 
have made the same considerations for their admission." 
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei investigation comes a day after the Southern Section Executive 
Committee ordered an investigation of the Montclair Prep athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
While Thomas and three members of the executive committee listened to an appeal 
Wednesday concerning a fifth year of eligibility for Leland Sparks, testimony 
from Jerome and Eric Sparks -- uncles of Derek and Leland -- persuaded the 
committee to investigate Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome and Eric Sparks accused the Montclair coaching staff and Vernon Simpson, 
principal, of grade tampering, recruiting inducements and supplying false 
information on eligibility guidelines. Leland was granted a fifth year, 
provided he qualifies academically. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy when Leland's eligibility had been denied two hours before Montclair 
Prep's season opener against Farrington High in Honolulu, Jerome Sparks ook the 
players to Mater Dei. The cousins are living in Santa Ana with June Sparks, 
Derek's mother, who recently moved from Wharton, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Porter said according to transcripts, some of which are unofficial, Leland is a 
C-plus student and Derek is a B-minus, which academically qualifies them for 
admission into Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
He added that no members of the athletic staff had input into their admission.

A SUSPECT AGAIN SLAIN BY POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTINGS: ASSAULT SUSPECT BECOMES THE NINTH PERSON KILLED BY SAN DIEGO POLICE 
OFFICERS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 21-year-old Ocean Beach man was shot and killed Thursday by one of the two 
San Diego Police officers who were attempting to arrest him on an assault 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect attacked the officers with a pair of martial arts 
nunchakus he had taken from one of them. The suspect was the ninth person to be 
slain by San Diego police so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting disputed the officers' account and questioned whether 
it was necessary for police to use deadly force in the incident, the second 
time this week that San Diego police have killed a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Police gave this description of Thursday's events: 
</P>
<P>
Officers John Cain and Detective Ron Featherly, both of whom have shot and 
killed suspects before, prepared to arrest Anthony Tumminia outside his West 
Point Loma Drive apartment on an assault charge at about 9 a.m. when he became 
violent. 
</P>
<P>
They walked Tumminia from his apartment to his red Toyota pickup truck to find 
a steering wheel locking device, which allegedly had been used in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Police could not say whether they found such a device or whether they had a 
search warrant. Nor did they have any details about the alleged assault. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Cain and Featherly began to arrest Tumminia, he resisted, grabbed 
Cain's nunchakus and struck both men. 
</P>
<P>
Cain fired a single shot into Tumminia's chest. He was pronounced dead at UC 
San Diego Medical Center at 9:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times, two witnesses disputed the police account and 
said they saw no nunchakus used by the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Hatfield, 21, who lives across the street from the restaurant parking 
lot where the shooting occurred, said the officers stood on either side of 
Tumminia and held him face down, with his hands behind his back. She said 
Featherly, dressed in a suit, was kicking Tumminia in the ribs at the time. 
</P>
<P>
They flipped Tumminia on his back, Hatfield said, and he began to rise. 
Tumminia stood up, and either pushed or hit Featherly, she said. He backed up 
two steps, apparently about to run, when Cain fired. 
</P>
<P>
She said Tumminia had no weapon at the time he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened like it was in slow motion," she said. "The last thing I could 
think of was that Tony was going to get shot. You're not supposed to resist 
arrest, but they could have done something else." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Tehan of Hillcrest was driving to a martial-arts class about 9:20 a.m. 
when she passed the restaurant parking lot. She said the officers had Tumminia 
pinned, and he was screaming at the same time the burglar alarm in his truck 
was wailing. She said she did not see a weapon in his hand from about 25 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (the shooting) was justified," she said. "I feel there are other 
ways of handling someone's anger." 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, a pair of black polycarbonate nunchakus, which all officers 
are required to carry, were lying on the ground next to Tumminia. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, 29, has been a patrol officer 1 1/2 years. He shot and killed an alleged 
purse snatcher in February after the man started to point an unloaded 
.22-caliber pistol at him. The district attorney cleared Cain in that shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Featherly, 30, a seven-year veteran, fatally shot 25-year-old Chip Doonan of 
Clairemont in January, 1988, an action Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller severely 
criticized while also clearing him of legal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Doonan had been carrying a pellet gun under his arm. When Featherly told him, 
"Put your hands up," it was his first warning to a startled Doonan, who reached 
for the gun, uttering "It's . . . " before Featherly shot him, according to the 
D.A.'s report. Doonan finished his sentence as he started to fall: " . . . only 
a BB gun." 
</P>
<P>
The report said Featherly was "visibly shaken" during the district attorney's 
interview. In his report, Miller concluded that Doonan's death was "a needless 
tragedy. The officers did nothing to alert Doonan to a police presence. They 
didn't call out to him or question those in the residence as to who he was." 
</P>
<P>
Miller rejected the Doonan family's assertion that police had been harassing 
Doonan for years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Featherly also shot and wounded a robbery suspect who had shot at him 
during a car chase. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cain nor Featherly was seriously hurt in the scuffle with Tumminia. 
</P>
<P>
Tumminia, whom friends described as a health-conscious body-builder, lost his 
job as a Domino's pizza deliverer on Voltaire Street two weeks ago after 
getting into a fistfight with a customer, said Chris Peters, who was an 
assistant manager at the store. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors remembered Tumminia as friendly, good with kids, and seemingly unable 
to work himself into the violent frenzy of which he is accused. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't picture Tony as the type to resist arrest," said Michelle Warren, a 
neighbor who heard the gunfire and saw police standing over Tumminia with guns 
drawn. "He was just a young kid starting out. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if he took the nunchakus from a cop's belt, I can't see getting shot in 
the chest." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's events once again raised questions about the number of times San 
Diego police officers have been involved in shootings -- 21 times so far this 
year, nine of them fatal. Last year, there were 24 police shootings, the 
highest ever for San Diego police in the last six years. In 1988, there were 10 
fatal shootings by police. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a wave of police shootings, just a series of incidents that have 
to be looked at individually," Deputy Chief Ken Fortier said Thursday. "I know 
the public is concerned. So are we. But officers are lawfully permitted to 
shoot if their lives are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor told a gathering of reporters Thursday that she had no 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as alarmed as everyone else," she said after a speech. "We have to come up 
with some solution. It's clear this has become a recurring event." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen last month ordered a task force to analyze the 
department's use of deadly force, from a review of training and textbooks to 
the scrutiny of similar-sized agencies throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
He requested the review in response to three specific controversial shootings, 
two of which involved lethal force on men wielding baseball bats and the other 
a cement trowel. The district attorney's office has ruled on the trowel case 
and one of the baseball bat shootings, saying the officers in both cases acted 
in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police shot and killed a man armed with a 3-foot long wooden garden 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings have not been limited to the San Diego Police Department. Last 
Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol Agent fatally shot an undocumented alien who the 
agent said had hit him with a rock. Some witnesses said the man had thrown no 
rocks. 
</P>

Times staff writers Armando Acuna and Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed to this 
report.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE FOR TITLE OF 'TOUGH GUY'; 
</P>
<P>
CURT PRINGLE AND TOM UMBERG ARE FIGHTING IT OUT TO BECOME PROTECTOR IN A 
COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On a hot canyon hillside near the Mexican border, Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
watched recently as National Guard soldiers in full combat gear scrambled 
through the desert brush during a drug surveillance exercise. 
</P>
<P>
They were hidden so well that the troop commander challenged Pringle to scan 
the bushes up close to detect their location. Pringle, a Garden Grove 
Republican, shook his head. Moments later, a camouflaged soldier popped up just 
a few feet from the assemblyman and snapped to attention. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 miles to the north, Pringle's opponent in the Nov. 6 election is 
stationed at a desert Army base where he was deployed last week as part of the 
nation's military mobilization to counter Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Tom Umberg's campaign says it wants to downplay his temporary 
assignment with the Army Reserve, but it acknowledges that voters may 
sympathize with a candidate serving his country in a so-far popular cause. 
</P>
<P>
Let's color this campaign Army green. 
</P>
<P>
The race for the 72nd Assembly District is becoming a fight for the title of 
tough guy. Other politicians may debate abortion, the environment or traffic 
jams, but the battle between Pringle and Umberg is for protector in a community 
ravaged by crime. No other issue comes close. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everywhere in the 72nd District, there are signs of people who live each 
day with fear. Windows are covered with bars, doors are sealed with multiple 
locks, fierce dogs roam the yards and walls are splattered with gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the murders in Orange County last year occurred in the five 
cities represented in the 72nd District -- Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, 
Westminster and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said he was moved one day when he was campaigning door to door and 
separately met two families where a child had been murdered. The next day he 
met another one. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is part of what makes this largely blue-collar and ethnically rich 
district conservative in its politics. Its voters are predominantly Democratic, 
but they have still elected conservative Republicans such as Pringle and Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Democratic party leaders have fallen behind a conservative 
member of their own ranks to run against Pringle. Umberg is a former assistant 
U.S. attorney who prosecuted drug cases in Orange County and an ex-Army captain 
who is now a major in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
On many issues, he lines up closer to Republicans than Democrats. Like Pringle, 
he has campaigned against higher taxes and for the death penalty, and he 
supports President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban flag 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
Also like Pringle, Umberg has even criticized the Assembly's liberal Democrats 
for killing tough crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
So when it comes to solving crime, the candidates' positions are again similar, 
and for both, the rhetoric is emphasized with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophically, Pringle and Umberg start from the premise that tougher 
enforcement, rather than social programs, is the priority. In addition to the 
death penalty, they both favor longer criminal sentences especially for drug 
and gang-related violations, a more streamlined court system, bigger jails and 
more support for local police. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Umberg's credentials as a crime fighter, Pringle said recently: "I 
guess I don't have an opinion on that." Then he added, "On personal positions, 
there's not that great of a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg has been unable to campaign or talk with the media since he was 
stationed last Thursday at Ft. Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
With similar positions, the campaigns have fought for the image of crime 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Pringle traveled to the Mexican border in a National Guard helicopter 
to demonstrate his support for the anti-drug war. He was briefed on the guard's 
expanding anti-drug role including surveillance along the border, air support 
for local police missions and inspections of cargo at border stops. 
</P>
<P>
After the daylong tour, Pringle applauded the guard's effort, although as an 
assemblyman he has little control over it. The California National Guard 
receives only 5% of its budget from the state government, and none of the state 
money is used in the drug effort, a guard officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The guard also serves under the exclusive authority of the governor, not the 
Legislature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's campaign people, meanwhile, say that the candidate's military 
deployment is not politically motivated and that they are actually concerned 
that his absence from the race could hurt. He is scheduled to remain at the 
base just north of Barstow for two weeks, returning to the campaign later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager George Urch said Umberg told his superiors that he was 
available for duty when U.S. troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia last month. 
Urch said Umberg received orders for his assignment last week. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's wife, Robin, is also a major in the Army Reserve and served two weeks 
of active duty recently in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom and I discussed this the moment the Mideast crisis developed," she said. 
"We had one of those soul-searching discussions. The family is important and 
the campaign is important, but both of us have a sense of responsibility about 
serving if we're called." 
</P>
<P>
Politically, former county Democratic chairman John Hanna added, Umberg's 
deployment "is a plus. Here you've got the real thing . . . and there's a lot 
of sense of patriotism in that district." 
</P>
<P>
On the front lines of the crime war, it is city police and local politicians 
who decide to raid the crack houses and who patrol the neighborhoods -- not 
state assemblymen. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the legislator in Sacramento who writes the laws that local police 
enforce. And both campaigns have offered some record of the specific tools they 
would provide to local crime fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle complains that almost all of his crime legislation was killed by 
Democratic leaders who control the majority in the Legislature. Still, he 
authored two crime bills that failed and supported another that passed. 
</P>
<P>
One would allow the death penalty for selling drugs to a minor who dies as a 
result. Another bill would have doubled the sentence for first-degree murder 
and eliminated the possibility for parole. Both were killed in the Assembly 
Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he also supported a bill by Sen. David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to 
establish a drug task force in the state attorney general's office. The Roberti 
plan passed, but money for the program was cut when the state recently suffered 
budget problems, so it has never been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg, on the other hand, has proposed seven crime-related measures he hopes 
to pursue in the Legislature. They include the elimination of probation, 
forcing criminals to serve complete sentences, boot-camp-style incarceration 
for juvenile offenders, aggressive asset seizures for white-collar crimes and a 
more effective death penalty process. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, both campaigns claim experience with such crime issues and charge 
that the other is the neophyte. Pringle says he has written crime laws in the 
Legislature while Umberg has never served in elected office. But Umberg says 
that as a former prosecutor, he's the only candidate with firsthand experience 
on the problems facing law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the bills I've voted for," Pringle said. "I'm running on my 
record and let the people decide." 
</P>
<P>
Urch responded for Umberg: "What we're saying is talk is cheap; Pringle gives 
nothing but excuses. Tom Umberg will be much more effective at working inside 
on the Public Safety Committee to free up legislation that a lot of liberals 
have tied up there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRIME IN THE 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
The five cities in the 72nd Assembly District -- Anaheim, Garden Grove, Santa 
Ana, Stanton and Westminster -- are responsible for more than half of the 
county's crime, statistics show. The race for the Assembly seat between 
incumbent Curt Pringle and challenger Tom Umberg is becoming a fight for the 
title of crime fighter. Below are these five cities' shares of the countywide 
total of selected crimes reported to the police. 
</P>
<P>
MURDER/NON-NEGLIGENT MANSLAUGHTER: 64 % 
</P>
<P>
RAPE/ATTEMPTED RAPE: 44 %

LEADER OF 1988 JAILBREAK GETS LIFE IN PRISON PLUS 25 YEARS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader in a five-man escape from Orange County Jail two years ago was 
sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years Thursday for kidnaping a Santa Ana 
man and taking his car during the escapees' getaway. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael D. Taylor's days in court are far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 38, whose capture in South Dakota was aided by the TV show "America's 
Most Wanted," faces murder charges in Los Angeles County and charges in Alameda 
County involving a kidnap/rape following his jail escape, as well as the 
original charges involving seven robberies that first landed him in County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Should he ever resolve those cases, Taylor faces parole violation charges in 
Illinois and is a suspect in robberies in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy, from the day he turned 18, has been totally sociopathic," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Cafferty. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Manuel A. Ramirez told Taylor, who also goes by the name 
of Anthony Michael Gianelli, that he would have sentenced him to life in prison 
without possibility of parole if he could have. The judge gave Taylor the 
stiffest sentence possible -- a life term that permits parole -- plus 25 years 
after that, five years for each of Taylor's five previous robbery and burglary 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
While Taylor did not speak at his sentencing hearing, he could be heard 
mumbling complaints about the television cameras present in the courtroom for 
Fox Network's "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and four other inmates escaped from jail on Nov. 20, 1988, by descending 
from the roof using knotted bedsheets while one of the jail deputies was 
missing from his post. 
</P>
<P>
An individual who lived near the jail called 911 to report seeing one of the 
men peeling out of his jail clothes. Reports showed, however, that it would be 
another 20 minutes before any officials discovered that a jailbreak had taken 
place. 
</P>
<P>
One deputy was fired over the incident, and a second one was suspended. One 
escapee broke a leg during the descent from the roof, and he and a second man 
were caught immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and two other escapees stripped out of jail clothes and down to boxer 
shorts and shirts and then approached Donald Lamb in his carport at an 
apartment complex on North Bristol Street. They told him they needed a ride to 
a hospital where a friend had just been taken. When Lamb showed reluctance to 
help them, one of the three put a jail-made knife to his throat and threatened 
to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb testified that somewhere in Garden Grove they finally let him stop the car 
and he managed to escape. He also said he asked them to leave him alone but one 
of those with Taylor responded by kicking him in the head. Lamb said he then 
ran, fearing for his life, and the three drove off in his car. It was found 
later in Westminster, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's attorney, Martin Kossack, argued that what happened did not amount to 
an actual kidnaping since Taylor and the others only wanted the car. At one 
point in his legal papers, Kossack told the court: "It was the victim who 
abandoned the vehicle to the three. (Taylor) did not, at any time, attempt to 
rob Mr. Lamb of his vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Cafferty said after the sentencing Thursday that the defense seemed to be 
arguing that "law-abiding citizens are supposed to just cave in to lawless 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor told The Times Orange County Edition in a jailhouse interview that he 
felt compelled to escape from the jail because of inmate beatings and its poor 
health conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dying there; I was sick all the time," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Taylor admitted to a number of robberies after his escape 
but denied a rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
At his trial, he testified that Lamb had willingly driven the three. 
</P>
<P>
The other two involved in the Lamb kidnaping were caught within weeks of the 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, however, was not caught until six months later, after he was featured 
on the Fox program. 
</P>
<P>
The show aired on May 7, 1989, and led to a tip that he and his girlfriend had 
been seen in Portland, Me. The FBI learned that he was going by the name of 
Michael A. Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, a jeweler in Grand Rapids, S.D., called police and said that 
someone trying to sell him some jewels had seemed suspicious and that his name 
was Michael Prescott. Because of the TV show, the Prescott alias had been 
entered in the national crime data computer, and Taylor was soon arrested.

The body of a newborn girl was found Thursday by a custodian in a women's 
restroom at UCI Medical Center's Emergency Room, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the discovery, officials issued a plea for anybody with 
information about the baby or the identity and health of the mother to contact 
UCI Medical Center police. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a shock to have this happen at any time to any hospital," said hospital 
spokeswoman Fran Tardiff. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the dead baby deeply saddened hospital staffers who earlier in the 
day had been celebrating Wednesday's birth of quadruplets at the hospital, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the discovery were sketchy, and investigators declined to release 
much information. 
</P>
<P>
"We are withholding some information so as not to jeopardize the 
investigation," Tardiff said. "We're just hoping the news does get out so that 
if someone saw something they will contact us. A lot of questions need to be 
answered." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the full-term or near full-term baby had been found in the 
restroom by a custodian about 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency room doctors were immediately called to the restroom and pronounced 
the baby dead. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to say how long the infant may have been in the restroom 
where the custodian had found her or if attempts were made to resuscitate her. 
</P>
<P>
After the discovery, medical center police, Orange County coroner's 
investigators, and county crime lab technicians were called in to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy is scheduled today to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody with information about the incident can call UCI Medical Center police 
at (714) 634-5493.

KEY PROJECT IN WORKS FOR OCEANSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING: THE $325-MILLION DEAL WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT REDEVELOPMENT 
PROJECT IN THE CITY'S HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Oceanside is nearing an agreement with developers to build a $325-million 
commercial-hotel-residential project on 10 empty acres by the Oceanside Pier, 
the most important project in city redevelopment history. 
</P>
<P>
When the project on vacant land that once held sex arcades, adult theaters and 
bars is finished in 1992, it is expected to rejuvenate Oceanside's lackluster 
downtown with attractions for both tourists and local residents -- sort of a 
North County Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is what we've been working for over the last 17 years," city 
Redevelopment Director Patricia Hightman said Thursday. "This is the heart of 
our downtown." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are negotiating with Keenan Associates, owner of three blocks on 
Pacific Street directly across from the pier, and the Santa Fe Railroad's real 
estate division, Catellus Corp., which has five blocks just east of the Keenan 
property. The city owns two blocks in the project area. 
</P>
<P>
Landowner James Keenan and developer James Watkins propose a $250-million 
project consisting of a 250-room hotel, 150 condominiums, 350 time-share units, 
150,000 square feet of retail space and a 70,000-square-foot office building. 
</P>
<P>
The office building would be on a city-owned block at Hill Street and Mission 
Avenue that is separated from most of the project area. 
</P>
<P>
In a $75-million companion development, Catellus wants to build 15,000 square 
feet of restaurants, 64,000 square feet of shops, a 20,000-square-foot office 
building and 318 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Although Keenan and Catellus have had differences -- and one significant issue 
remains in dispute -- Hightman said she is confident the two coordinated 
projects are "extremely compatible." 
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic that, with one or two more meetings, we will bring the 
projects into complete compatibility and it will be a unified project," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the developers, the project will yield $4 million a year for the 
city through property, sales and bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials hope an agreement will be announced within two weeks, 
Mike Ogden, project manager for Keenan, predicted the deal probably will take 
until mid October. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden said a key outstanding issue is the height and density of the adjacent 
railroad project. Also, the amount and longevity of a city redevelopment 
subsidy to provide streets and other infrastructure for the development must be 
worked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real close" to a deal, said Ogden, adding, "We think this project will 
have a profound effect on the downtown of Oceanside." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of Catellus Corp. could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The project is a milestone in Oceanside's often frustrating struggle to return 
its coastal downtown to a safe, scenic and economically thriving area. 
</P>
<P>
During the '60s and '70s, much of the area slid into blight, worsened by social 
problems as drug dealers, gambling interests and prostitutes catered to young 
Marines during the Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in the '80s, the redevelopment program has cleaned up the 
beachfront, called The Strand, enticed attractive seaside condominiums, and 
encouraged some housing and commercial building rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The city pier was rebuilt a few years ago, and, in a bold commitment to 
reviving the downtown, the city invested $30 million in a new Spanish-style 
Civic Center that opened in June. It is three blocks away from the pier area 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The city's strategy in erecting the Civic Center downtown was to generate 
confidence by private developers and local residents, many of whom long ago 
stopped shopping downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pioneering area," said Ogden. "Nobody has done any sizable 
commercial projects in the area." 
</P>
<P>
He believes the Keenan job, which "is going to be a Seaport Village type of 
project" will have a "domino effect" by encouraging others to invest in 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Stebbins Dean, chief administrative officer of the Oceanside Chamber of 
Commerce, said he believes the pier-area project has taken the redevelopment 
effort "near its peak." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt it is the most significant redevelopment project you can 
expect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that, despite the project, "it's not like you take a deep 
breath and say Oceanside is complete now." He said the city still sorely needs 
more downtown retail, more businesses to serve tourists, building renovation 
and street beautification.

Photo, Early Taste of Fall Due: Heat and costal fog, like that shrouding part 
of a Navy ship at North Island, were the hallmark of the weather this week. 
That will change over the weekend, National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur 
Shigehara said Thursday. "The heat wave is over," Shigehara said, as he 
predicted the weekend will be a pleasant preview of the fall. He said the 
demise of hot weather was caused by a high pressure system that had hovered 
over San Diego moving to the east. The only clouds on the distant horizon are 
from a storm far to the south that provide a slight chance of raising surf and 
shading sunshine. Unless that happens, there will be sunny days with high beach 
temperatures of 67 to 72, coastal highs of 74 to 79, inland highs of 80 to 88, 
mountain highs of 78 to 84, and desert highs 102 and 108. Barbara Martin

Homemade Latino foods, children's games, dance groups and live music will be 
some of the features at the first Health Fair in the streets of the 
Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood behind Disneyland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Avenue, the main street through the small, low-income community, will be 
filled Saturday morning with health agencies offering free services including 
measles vaccinations, blood pressure readings and AIDS tests. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, several social service agencies will staff booths with 
representatives to answer questions about housing, immigration services, 
employment and legal aid. 
</P>
<P>
"The incentive is, if they go to the health screenings, they'll get a free 
ticket for the booth games," said Anita Castro-Zvoda, director of the 
Jeffrey-Lynne Community Center.

PRINCIPAL EARNS STATE RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Tim Harvey, life as principal of William E. Fanning Elementary School means 
being a jack-of-all-trades. 
</P>
<P>
He will play one-on-one basketball with a student during recess or perform some 
maintenance duties if a janitor calls in sick. He will even survey students to 
see how much they like the playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a North Dakota farm boy, so this job fits perfectly," Harvey said. "We do 
whatever needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
This down-home approach to what often is considered an aloof position helped 
earn him statewide recognition Thursday, when state Supt. of Public Instruction 
Bill Honig announced that Harvey would be one of 12 recipients of the 1990 
California Educator Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The award is given to teachers and administrators for their leadership 
abilities, professional growth, achievements and overall commitment to 
excellence in education. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, 44, who has been principal at the school since 1983, was cited for 
being an administrator who "does not seek power but from whom power seems to 
naturally flow." He also was honored for helping launch several special school 
programs that have become models for the rest of the district. 
</P>
<P>
The winners were chosen by the California State Steering Committee, which was 
established by the California Assn. of County Superintendents of Schools and 
the state Department of Education. Funding for the awards was provided by the 
Milken Family Foundation, which initiated the program in 1987. Recipients will 
be honored at a luncheon in San Francisco on Oct. 11, and each will receive 
$25,000 at a ceremony next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be much more comfortable for me to make this a team award," Harvey 
said. "You don't have to look too far to see that you should share the 
limelight." 
</P>
<P>
He points to the fact that the school, which opened in 1970, is not a 
collection of classrooms but, rather, pods. Several classes and grades are 
grouped together in one circular room, separated only by temporary walls. Thus, 
teachers, administrators and students are forced to work more closely. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people you can talk to and others that are a step above you," 
said Teddi Coulton, a kindergarten teacher. "You can talk to him. He's a 
caring, concerned individual." 
</P>
<P>
The committee recognized Harvey for implementing an integrated language arts 
curriculum, much of it based on the importance of literature and reading. The 
curriculum includes a Books &amp; Beyond program, designed to encourage 
students to adopt better reading habits by rewarding them for number of books 
read. Last year, students read 15,150 books, and those at higher levels read a 
total of 397,804 pages last year. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and parents also like to point out some simple programs that have gone 
a long way. Harvey helped create a "success button" program, in which students 
are personally recognized for their work, and several special homework programs 
for gifted students. 
</P>
<P>
He also helped start a Jog-a-Thon, an annual fund-raiser that raises about 
$20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, whose education career began in 1969, was formerly a teacher and 
assistant principal at a junior high in the Orange Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Fanning Elementary was one of 20 schools in the state to win a 
California Distinguished School Award. Parents and teachers say that the school 
-- with 530 students from quiet, middle-class neighborhoods in Brea -- might 
not have any flashy gimmicks that separate it from others, but it is laced with 
a spirit of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"What is done here is done really, really well," said Teresa Hampson, past 
president of the school's Parent-Teacher Organization. "We're just real good at 
what everybody else does." TED JOHNSON

ILLEGAL ALIENS ON FREEWAYS TO BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major policy change, the U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol 
announced Thursday that they will begin apprehending undocumented aliens who 
gather on freeway medians, in a plan to reduce the number of deaths occurring 
when migrants dash across the highway and are struck by motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol and CHP officials said the new policy, which became effective 
Wednesday, was instituted because the old one sometimes encouraged hundreds of 
illegal aliens to loiter on freeway medians, knowing the Border Patrol would 
not try to arrest them there. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said the previous policy prohibited agents 
from attempting to apprehend aliens on medians "for obvious safety reasons." 
</P>
<P>
"What we have been trying has not been working. People are still getting 
killed, and that is unacceptable," Swofford said. " . . . We will try to 
implement the new policy in a very cautious manner. We're not putting a lot of 
pressure on them. We're pulling over on the median well away from them, so they 
don't panic and run out in front of traffic." 
</P>
<P>
However, Swofford said agents will pursue migrants who try to evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to do it as safely as we possible can," Swofford added. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the California Rural Legal Assistance, 83 
illegal migrants have been killed on San Diego-area freeways within 5 miles of 
the border since 1987. An additional 33 have died during the same period near 
the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre in North County when they were hit 
by cars traveling on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
On their trek north, illegal aliens frequently hide or wait on freeway medians 
until they are picked up by smugglers who transport them away from the border. 
Most of the migrants, especially those from the interior of Mexico, have never 
seen a freeway and are unable to gauge a car's speed. 
</P>
<P>
Deaths usually occur when they attempt to cross a busy freeway to get to the 
median. At San Onofre, migrants are frequently killed when they try to 
circumvent the INS checkpoint by jumping out of smugglers' vehicles and running 
west -- across eight lanes of traffic -- to the beach. After walking north past 
the checkpoint, they then recross the freeway and are picked up by the 
smugglers to continue their northward journeys. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has attempted to curb mounting 
freeway deaths by posting signs to warn motorists in areas where aliens 
congregate on the median. Lights have also been installed on freeway stretches 
where aliens are known to gather. However, those efforts have met with little 
success. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Jim Anderson said the CHP will assist the Border Patrol "only on a 
casual basis" and will not respond every time agents attempt to arrest migrants 
hiding on the median. 
</P>
<P>
"If an officer can safely approach them on the median, we will detain them and 
hand them over to the Border Patrol," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy will be effective only in the San Diego area and not at San 
Onofre, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant rights activists immediately attacked the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally irresponsible and reckless policy," said Roberto Martinez of 
the American Friends Service Committee, a migrants rights group. "They're 
gathering at the median to get away from the Border Patrol. When the Border 
Patrol shows its presence, they will start dashing in and out of the freeway 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The Border Patrol is jeopardizing people's lives just to apprehend them. . . . 
Renewing this policy is like taking one step forward and two steps back," 
Martinez added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, CHP and Border Patrol officials said they will go ahead 
with the apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 80-some people killed over the past few years. Do you just sit there 
and say that's an acceptable toll?" asked the CHP's Anderson. "This is almost 
our last alternative. We've tried posting signs, installing freeway lights and 
handing out leaflets at the border. Nothing has worked in the past." 
</P>
<P>
According to Anderson, the CHP and Border Patrol have apprehended up to 300 
aliens at one time on a freeway median. Some CHP cars have been pelted by rocks 
thrown by aliens loitering on the medians, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford complained that critics of the policy would complain regardless of 
what the Border Patrol did. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get people used to the idea that they cannot go out on the freeway, 
these killings will stop," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said CHP officers will also be enforcing the law that prohibits 
pedestrians on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Do they want to just let these people get run over and ignore the fact that 
they're also breaking the law?" Anderson asked. "They're entering the country 
illegally and breaking the law against pedestrians on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez countered that CHP officers are in effect going to be enforcing U.S. 
immigration laws by getting involved in the apprehensions. "This is totally out 
of their jurisdiction. They are only going to exacerbate the problem because it 
will put more officers chasing people on the freeway," Martinez said. He said 
the change in policy is premature and accused the CHP and Border Patrol of 
acting unilaterally when both agencies are members of an advisory committee 
formed by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) to find a solution to the 
freeway deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"They completely ignored what we're trying to do in the committee," Martinez 
said. "It's very upsetting. We've been meeting for about six months, and they 
go on and implement this policy on their own." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Martinez and California Rural Legal Assistance attorneys 
wrote a letter to INS Commissioner Gene McNary, asking him to review Border 
Patrol policy on chasing aliens on freeways.

Officials from seven state and federal agencies held afternoon and evening 
forums to hear the public's ideas. The agencies plan to sue the parties 
responsible for the American Trader tanker spill to recover an unspecified 
amount of money for the closure of the beaches and the harm to natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was small -- only eight residents spoke at the afternoon session, 
which was adjourned early. But state officials said they were pleased with the 
ideas, which they called creative and intriguing. Now they must determine if 
any are achievable and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to go back and evaluate them. We will take a look at them all," 
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Sylvia Cano Hale, who is preparing a lawsuit 
representing the state. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Leipzig, executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a local 
wetlands-protection group, recommended a permanent wildlife recovery center in 
Orange County to care for injured birds and animals. About 700 birds died when 
the tanker ran aground over its own anchor and spilled nearly 400,000 gallons 
of Alaskan crude off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested construction of a gate or other device to protect Orange 
County's wetlands from spills and search for new technology to replace the 
plastic, snakelike booms that are currently used to contain oil slicks. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gorman, executive director of the group that manages the wetlands, 
suggested that the state use settlement money or fines to invest in new 
marshes. About 90% of the county's coastal wetlands have been filled to make 
way for development, so the purchase and restoration of those resources "should 
be the No. 1 priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said the state should consider buying and restoring an undeveloped, 
66-acre parcel along Pacific Coast Highway near Brookhurst Avenue owned by a 
private partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"Restoring even just a portion of it would be better than none," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Pratte, former director of the Surfrider Foundation, a 
surfing-environmental group based in Huntington Beach, suggested a new 
boardwalk or bike path along the Newport Beach coast, or a seawall to shore up 
the unstable Huntington Beach bluffs area. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have not yet determined what companies will be sued. British 
Petroleum owned the oil, American Trading Transportation owns the tanker, and 
Golden West Refining operates the offshore terminal where it ran aground. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said nothing will ease their haunting memories of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anything can compensate for the loss of the birds," said Linda 
Patterson, a Huntington Beach resident. "I'll never forget seeing that." MARLA

NEW FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five of the largest local development-oriented firms are heading up a new 
campaign to raise the remaining $2.85 million needed to rebuild the municipal 
pier, a city spokesman announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The group of businesses backing the "Landmark Campaign" will serve as the 
umbrella organization for all private fund-raising efforts for the pier, said 
Dennis Williams, an assistant public information officer for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's co-chairmen are Roger J. Work, vice president and general 
manager of the Huntington Beach Co., the city's largest private landowner, and 
Robert L. Mayer, the Newport Beach-based developer of the sprawling Waterfront 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The new campaign is scheduled to begin Saturday with an event planned as part 
of the Waterfront's four-day grand-opening ceremonies, which began Thursday. 
The pier benefit, to be attended by a select group of business leaders, will 
feature a concert by surf-music performers Jan &amp; Dean. 
</P>
<P>
The $11.7-million pier reconstruction project is scheduled to get under way 
within the next two weeks. The city thus far has received about $8.85 million 
for the project, mainly from federal, state and county grants, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thursday's announcement of the fund-raising pledge coincided with the 
first day of the Waterfront Hilton hotel's opening ceremonies, none of the 
officials at the hotel fete mentioned the new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mayer joined other project promoters, city officials, local business 
leaders and about 250 guests gathered outside the hotel for the opening event 
amid pomp, celebration and self-congratulatory speeches. With flashbulbs 
popping and video cameras rolling, officials cut a ribbon christening the 
beachside hotel and dedicated a time capsule buried last week at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening, which runs through Sunday, comes almost two months after the 
$55-million, 13-story hotel opened for business July 24. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled hotel events still to come include a beach-themed fund-raiser from 
6:30 to 11 tonight to benefit the Huntington Harbour Philharmonic, which puts 
on the "Cruise of Lights" boating parade each holiday season. Also planned is 
fund-raising a ball for Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is the first of six planned phases of a $600-million project that 
will sprawl along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway. JOHN PENNER

COUNCIL APPROVES REMAP SETTLEMENT, BUT JUDGE SAYS QUESTIONS LINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of the San Diego City Council on Thursday approved a settlement 
agreement of a Latino voting rights lawsuit, but a possible new kink appeared 
when the federal judge hearing the case said there are still some "serious" 
issues to be resolved and left open the possibility of future depositions of 
City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of those issues -- raised by council members who oppose the 
settlement -- and whether they will keep the agreement from becoming final was 
left to the interpretation of lawyers involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Aguirre, the lawyer who filed the class-action lawsuit two years ago, 
insisted that, "as a practical matter, it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Kenneth So, representing the city of San Diego as the 
defendant in the suit, said, "The litigation has a few (more) steps that are 
necessary before it is finally put to rest, including a final hearing. The 
court wants to make sure all the legal questions are answered." 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Rhoades is a cautious man," So said of U.S. District Judge John S. 
Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
David Lundin, a lawyer representing three members of the council who approved 
the settlement, told reporters he too believes the case has realistically ended 
because the two parties to the lawsuit -- Aguirre and the Chicano Federation of 
San Diego County Inc., representing Latinos and blacks as a class, and the city 
of San Diego -- have agreed to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Mayor Maureen O'Connor and other council members who oppose the 
settlement agreement contend that the map containing redrawn City Council 
district boundaries is flawed because, they say, parts of it were drafted in 
secret by members of a five-member council majority. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, they say, the majority bloc acted in bad faith and might have 
broken the law by meeting in secret and violating the state's open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Monaghan, one of two attorneys representing O'Connor, told the judge, who 
held the hearing from Montana via a teleconference call, that the court has an 
obligation to make sure the proposed map was done legally. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is whether we have a right to object" to the settlement in court and 
continue the lawsuit by having depositions, Monaghan told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Donald McGrath, who also represents the mayor, told reporters that, 
although the two parties to the suit have agreed to a settlement, "you can't do 
anything that affronts others' rights." In this context, he said, that would be 
the mayor and those who weren't included in "meetings that are supposed to be 
open." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and other members of the council minority have said the map included 
in the settlement splits neighborhoods for political ends and punishes 
political enemies of the council majority, such as Councilman Bruce Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said that the City Council's approval of the settlement earlier in the 
afternoon by a 5-2 vote, with O'Connor and Ron Roberts absent, "does change the 
whole complexion of the case dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was "surprised and disappointed to find out we have a 
different ballgame" because of the mayor's and others' objections, and that he 
was "disappointed" the case wasn't settled and was going "on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said he will issue an order next week outlining legal questions he 
wants the lawyers to answer. 
</P>
<P>
He said, for example, that, since the mayor and some council members have 
objections, he wants to know whether they have legal standing to raise those 
questions because they are not members of the legal class represented in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether such an objection can be made by . . . (someone) outside the 
class," Rhoades said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that, even if the state's open-meeting law was violated and/or 
the council majority acted in bad faith, it might not make any difference if 
the proposed new council districts are constitutional and don't violate the 
federal Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said the matter of whether the council majority broke the law might 
best be left to the grand jury and the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"By asking these questions, I don't mean I have the answers. . . . I don't," 
Rhoades said. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of depositions has loomed large over the case. Before the proposed 
settlement was agreed to, the Chicano Federation and Aguirre were pressing 
ahead to hold public sworn interrogations of the five-member council majority 
and their aides. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was attempting to use the depositions to accomplish exactly what the 
mayor and minority council faction want to do now: find evidence of secret 
meetings that led to the five-member bloc's approval of a redistricting map 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that map violated a previous settlement agreement and the Voting 
Rights Act by not creating a district in which a Latino had a good chance of 
being elected. 
</P>
<P>
It was only at the last-minute Wednesday, the same day depositions were 
scheduled to begin, that the five-member majority -- composed of Bob Filner, 
Wes Pratt, Linda Bernhardt, John Hartley and Abbe Wolfsheimer -- reversed their 
earlier stand and agreed to the new map contained in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The new map contains an 8th District with an 53.8% Latino population, which was 
what Aguirre wanted and was the aim of the lawsuit. It also includes, however, 
district boundaries in the northern part of the city that were part of the 
original redistricting approved by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and other members of the minority bloc, such as Roberts, contend that 
it was the prospect of politically embarrassing information coming out of the 
depositions that caused the five to switch. 
</P>
<P>
The five, who maintain they have nothing to hide, say they changed their minds 
to avoid a costly and lengthly court fight. They also say the new districts in 
the north are pro-neighborhood and pro-environment, and they wanted those 
boundaries preserved. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, in approving the settlement agreement, set a public hearing 
on the new redistricting for Sept. 24. It was not clear, however, whether the 
hearing will be held before resolution of the questions Rhoades has posed.

<P>
A 22-year-old man, shot and wounded by police last week, was charged Thursday 
with three felony counts, including assault with a firearm on a peace officer, 
a deputy district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean White of Southeast San Diego was also charged with being a felon in 
possession of a firearm and for being a felon with a concealed firearm, said 
deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Al Williams. 
</P>
<P>
White, a 1985 graduate of La Jolla High School and former captain of the 
football team, was on parole after pleading guilty to the October, 1986, 
kidnaping of a Navy enlisted man. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the prior felony, White could have an extra five years tacked on to 
his sentence if convicted, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
White was arrested last Wednesday after allegedly starting to draw a 
semiautomatic pistol on a San Diego Police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired five shots, hitting White once in the stomach and once 
grazing his back. 
</P>
<P>
When White collapsed, an additional weapon -- a sawed-off shotgun -- fell out 
of his jacket, police said. 
</P>
<P>
White was released Monday from Mercy Hospital. He is being held at the County 
Jail and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Sept. 26.

A City Heights man convicted of involuntary manslaughter was sentenced to three 
years in state prison Thursday in the April 22 death of a 12-year-old girl who 
jumped from his truck on Interstate 5 to her death. 
</P>
<P>
Two relatives of the girl made outbursts in court and left the courtroom during 
the sentencing of Jesus Hector Garcia Artega, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also was fined $1,200 by San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia pleaded guilty in July to involuntary manslaughter in the death of 
Sylvia Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
As Garcia's attorney, Alex Loebig asked about a dozen relatives of Garcia to 
stand in court to show their support, relatives of the slain girl said that 
they should also be acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd told the packed courtroom that anyone who spoke out during the sentencing 
would be ordered to leave. The judge then asked that the victim's relatives 
also stand. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia told the judge he "never tried to hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Loebig conceded that Garcia "acted irresponsibly" by not stopping or returning 
to the scene after the girl jumped out of the car.

PREMATURE QUADRUPLETS ALL IN FAIR CONDITION;

NEWBORNS: O.C.'S NEWEST MOTHER OF QUADS GETS SOME HELPFUL HINTS FROM ANOTHER 
RECENT PARENT, KAREN MINER.

<P>
Quadruplets -- three girls and a boy -- born to a Santa Ana couple Wednesday 
night were all in fair condition Thursday at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the boy, Jeremy Stewart Amante, who has been receiving oxygen, 
will require medication to help close an opening between his heart and lungs 
that is common in premature infants. 
</P>
<P>
But at 3 pounds, 9 1/2 ounces, Jeremy is the largest of the quads and is 
expected to do fine, said Dr. James Banks, the neonatologist on duty at the 
intensive care unit. The babies, small enough to be cradled together in two 
palms, arrived 11 weeks early and were all delivered by Cesarean section within 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"These babies are big, healthy 29-weekers," said Banks. "They are doing 
absolutely wonderfully, which is unusual in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile their mother, 28-year-old Consolacion (Solly) Amante, has already 
received flowers, reassurances and how-to tips from Orange County's other 
recent veteran of quadruplets. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been bad at all," said Karen Miner, an Orange schoolteacher who gave 
birth to two boys and two girls seven months ago, and now has "one crawler and 
three scooters." 
</P>
<P>
"I kept waiting for the bomb to drop, for it to get unbearable and terrible, 
but it hasn't," Miner said Thursday. "I only hope Solly has it as easy." 
</P>
<P>
What the new mother will need most, Miner said, is full-time help. Other 
essential tools for quad-rearing, she said, include baby swings. 
</P>
<P>
"Battery-run, definitely, because she's never going to have time to go wind up 
those swings. And she needs a battery recharger, because she's not going to be 
able to afford to keep buying batteries," Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
The three Amante girls -- Jeraldine Elaine and Jessamine Eileen, both 2 pounds 
14 1/2 ounces, and Jacqueline Elise, 2 pounds 12 ounces -- were being fed for 
the first time Thursday afternoon with a half-strength formula specially 
blended for premature infants. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their virtually identical features, which include matching dimples 
on their left cheeks, doctors and nurses suspect the three girls are identical, 
meaning they developed from the same egg. They won't know for sure, however, 
until tests have been completed on blood samples and the four placentas. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls are beautiful. They look just like their mother," said Mari Jo 
Craft, head nurse of the Infant Special Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
All four babies have shocks of jet-black curly hair covered by tiny ski caps -- 
pink and white for the girls, blue and white for Jeremy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a forehead just like his father," Craft said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three other sets of quadruplets have been born in Orange County. In 
1969, Mrs. Robert Curtin of Garden Grove gave birth to four boys, three of whom 
survived. Janet and Scott Lederhaus, formerly of Santa Ana and now of 
Claremont, had three boys and a girl in 1983, and they helped prepare Al and 
Karen Miner before their quads were born on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous two sets of quadruplets, the Amante babies are natural and 
not the result of fertility drugs, doctors said. The chances of such a 
spontaneous birth are about one in 512,000, said Manuel Porto, who delivered 
both the Miner and the Amante quadruplets. 
</P>
<P>
However, Solly Amante, also the mother of 4-year-old Jonathan and 1-year-old 
Jane Amante, did receive special prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-1, small-boned Filipino mother learned that she was having 
quadruplets only when she had an ultrasound late this summer. She spent most of 
the last two months in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"They were packed in there very tightly," reported head nurse Craft. "It was 
probably like popcorn popping when they moved." 
</P>
<P>
Solly Amante was hospitalized with premature contractions on Aug. 20. Doctors 
gave her steroids to accelerate the growth of the fetuses and sought to delay 
delivery so that the babies would be more fully developed at birth, Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy seemed to have paid off, Banks said, noting that the babies were 
unusually hardy for quadruplets born nearly three months early. 
</P>
<P>
Amante was not up to an interview Thursday, but nurses said she would be seeing 
the babies for the first time since their birth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," said their father, Oscar Amante, 30, who works for an Irvine 
computer printer manufacturer and was on his way to visit the newborns Thursday 
afternoon. "I was in shock, but I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the mother may be well enough to go home within three to four 
days, but the quadruplets will not be able to follow until each has reached 5 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When they do come home, Miner said, organization is key. Every day, she 
prepares 20 bottles for the following day, keeps records of each baby's feeding 
and changing to prevent slip-ups and has mastered the art of feeding two quads 
in her lap while sticking a bottle in the mouth of a third. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago, the Miners even went away for the weekend and left the quads 
with their grandparents. "I said to Al, the key is not how they did this time, 
but will they ever do it again?" she said about their baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
Among her other advice for the Amantes: "Remember that babies do cry. Take one 
day at a time. And accept the help. Say yes, yes, yes, yes."

This collection of four large, lavish eateries, built in the 5 o'clock shadow 
of the Hyatt Regency hotel, opened less than a year ago. Even so, it has caught 
on to the point that, at least on weekends, the parking valets often do a 
turn-away business. Youth, gilded and otherwise, largely is responsible for the 
crush, which overflows the restaurants' tables and bars to jam the sidewalk 
cafes operated by three of them. The scene is unrivaled in San Diego, and, if 
you watch long enough, it seems that just about anything may happen. One recent 
Friday, an impossibly long, white, stretch limousine rolled up and disgorged 
its driver, an Elvis Presley look-alike so convincing that he seemed to have 
stepped straight from the cover of a supermarket tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
P.J. Wolf, the restaurant that holds the greatest appeal for the over-25 set, 
seems a haven of calm after passing through the outdoor bustle. The place 
opened in January as the most upscale of the collection, a position that it 
maintains today, although the menu has been rewritten considerably to reflect 
the new price-consciousness that has prompted several restaurants to offer 
lower-priced meals. 
</P>
<P>
When P.J. Wolf opened, it took the tone of an extravagant New York steakhouse, 
expressed through an a la carte menu of luxury items that, if indulged in 
freely, added up to one of the heftier dinner checks in town. Massive steaks 
held center stage, to be sure, supplemented by several deluxe seafood 
offerings. The starters and side dishes were particularly grand and helped very 
much to make the meal. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has modified rather than discarded its upscale persona. Gone are 
the crusty, finely vinegary potatoes lyonnaise and the exquisitely garlicky 
creamed spinach, both of which cost more than $4, and that in a city virtually 
unacquainted with a la carte menus. Gone, too, are the crab-stuffed shrimp and 
some of the steaks, although the menu continues to list New York sirloin and 
filet mignon cut from certified Angus beef. At $21.95, these weigh in as by far 
the priciest items. Both continue to be lightly brushed, if desired, with the 
kitchen's appealing fiorentina basting sauce, a sort of all-purpose blend of 
olive oil, garlic and lemon juice that P.J. Wolf also applies to the grilled 
fresh seafood of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The old menu disdained prime rib, but the new one includes it in three cuts 
priced from $13.95 to $17.50. Other innovations are barbecued pork ribs, served 
as a full slab for $13.95; a chopped steak (made from trimmings of Angus beef, 
which is a nice touch) at $11.95; sole stuffed with seafood, also $11.95; and 
several moderately priced pastas. One of these echoes a popular dish served at 
the Manhattan restaurant in downtown La Jolla, which is under the same 
ownership as P.J. Wolf. Manhattan's steak Sinatra, a generous sirloin topped 
with sauteed peppers, onions and tomatoes, here becomes fettuccine Sinatra, or 
noodles tossed with tenderloin tips and the same garnish. 
</P>
<P>
The menu also has been expanded to include a pair of handsome and relatively 
expensive veal chop preparations, one finished parmigiana-style, the other a 
more delicate milanese that moistens the crisp, breaded crust with lemon, 
butter and parsley. Free-range Shelton chicken, a recent addition to several 
local menus, is basted with herbs as it roasts and is offered for one or two. 
</P>
<P>
Except that entrees now include a vegetable garnish, the menu retains an a la 
carte format. The brief appetizer list includes Louisiana oysters, served raw 
on the shell or baked Rockefeller-style; fried zucchini and calamari rings; and 
an impressive shrimp cocktail that is chunked rather than whole, and blended 
into the sauce so that it seems a sort of pungent cold soup. 
</P>
<P>
The salads continue to be on the extravagant side, but worth it. The best may 
be the tomato salad, an obvious idea with which local eateries rarely trouble 
themselves, perhaps because it eschews greens and thus seems un-Californian. It 
consists simply of a ring of thickly cut, wonderfully ripe tomato slices, 
layered with thin rounds of red onion and topped with apple-smoked bacon of 
marvelous flavor, Parmesan cheese and a smooth, mint-and-garlic vinaigrette. 
The DiMaggio salad also is a blend of flavorful, top-quality ingredients, 
including mixed greens, crumbled blue cheese, minced bacon, egg and scallions 
and a mild dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The chopped steak was grilled to a crusty finish, with its fine succulence 
picked up by an old-fashioned, all-American brown sauce jammed with wilted 
onions and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also grilled medium-sized scallops, an increasingly prevalent 
method that takes a little getting used to. But these had a tender finish, 
which is not easy with a creature as temperamental as a scallop. The grill also 
imparted a notably smoky flavor, which the kitchen moderated with a generous 
basting of fiorentina sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The side dishes still arrive in quantity sufficient to serve two or three, so 
be careful when ordering. The "Italian" steak fries nearly make the grade, 
except that this is one of those restaurants that considers it chic to leave 
the peel on the potato. These particular spuds get a flavorful sprinkle of 
Parmesan and olive oil on the way from the fryer to the table. The stuffed 
potato au gratin was exactly what it sounds like, which is to say stuffed with 
cheese and twice-baked to a very creamy texture. The side par excellence, 
however, was a platter of doughnut-sized onion rings, tender despite their 
immense girth and very tasty when dipped in the pungent barbecue sauce offered 
on the side. 
</P>
<P>
P.J. Wolf has its own Italian baker, who turns out a lavish tray decorated with 
sfogliatella, a many-leaved crisp pastry filled with a smooth cream; rum cake; 
a rich, tipsy cannoli cake; crisp cannoli in plain and very good chocolate 
versions studded with pistachios; eclairs; a forgettable chocolate mousse cake; 
a traditional Napoleon and a fruity alternative named, most aptly, the 
Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
The decor hovers somewhere between the formal and the theatrical. The richly 
paneled walls support pastiche-like paintings of celebrities; Marlene Dietrich 
wears a boa of real peacock feathers and Michael Jackson's jacket is fitted 
with real studs. The most striking may be the portrait of Bette Davis, whose 
eyes stare sardonically at a dining room (for those who recall the restaurant 
scene in "All About Eve") equipped with nary a relish tray. 
</P>
<P>
P.J. WOLF, 8980 University Centre Lane, 452-9653. Lunch and dinner daily. 
Credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and 
tip, $35 to $90.

BOARD TO LET PARENTS, PRINCIPALS STUDY ELECTROMAGNETIC HAZARDS

Faced with complaints about the potential danger of electromagnetic fields 
caused by high-tension power lines near schools, the Fountain Valley School 
District board agreed Thursday to let parents and officials at each campus 
examine the problem and recommend measures to avoid possible health risks. 
</P>
<P>
Committees from each school will report back to the board, which will have 
final authority over what measures are taken. Those actions might include 
roping off parts of the campuses, rearranging lunch tables or changing seating 
in some classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision came after it was presented with the results of tests on 
electromagnetic field levels at six of the district's 11 schools. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, conducted late last month by Southern California Edison Co. 
officials, found electromagnetic levels ranging from 2 milligauss to as much as 
130 milligauss outside a restroom at Samuel Talbert Middle School. A milligauss 
is a unit of measurement of magnetic-field strength. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said Edison will be testing at the district's other schools, 
but no dates have been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have contended that long-term exposure to electromagnetic 
fields higher than 3 milligauss might be linked to childhood cancer. But a 
recent report issued by the state Department of Health Services suggests that 
it is not possible to label any particular level "safe" or "dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
School board members have been reluctant to take any action until standards are 
established or action is recommended by state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Sahl, a Southern California Edison research scientist, said he thinks 
it would be reasonable to investigate the reading of 130 milligauss and take 
some action. 
</P>
<P>
"My position would be: Let's find out what's going on here," Sahl said. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents were not happy with the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't gamble with my child's life, and I don't think the district has the 
right to make that gamble either," said Barbara Emerson, one of the parents.

BOY THREATENED SISTER BEFORE SHOOTING HER, DETECTIVE TESTIFIES

<P>
A 14-year-old boy accused of murdering his 12-year-old sister told her, "You 
better be quiet or I'll shoot you," moments before fatally wounding her with a 
.22-caliber rifle, an Anaheim police detective testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Carl Martin said Richard Hubler threatened his sister, Gema Marie 
Hubler, while the boy was on the telephone talking to a friend who later 
recounted the episode to police. 
</P>
<P>
But the friend who overheard the argument, Cynthia Alvarez, recanted her 
earlier statement to police and testified in court that she only heard Hubler 
threaten to "kick her ass." 
</P>
<P>
"Did he say, 'You better be quiet or I'll shoot you?' " Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Brent F. Romney asked Alvarez during the second day of the murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was one of Hubler's friends who provided testimony that was 
inconsistent with earlier statements made to police shortly after the June 14 
shooting at the Hublers' Anaheim residence. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's interview with police was tape-recorded, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler threatened to shoot his sister, Martin testified, after the brother and 
sister got into an argument over the use of the telephone and after the girl 
said she would tell their parents that Hubler had a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, Hubler was on probation for two weapons-related 
offenses and was under court order not to use or possess firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler's father, James, had testified earlier in the day that he had "grounded" 
his son five days before the shooting after the boy's mother discovered another 
weapon and ammunition in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez testified that during her telephone conversation with Hubler, he fired 
the weapon twice.

CUNNINGHAM IN SWIM OF THINGS AT EDISON; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: SENIOR LEAVES BEACH AND BODYSURFING BEHIND LONG ENOUGH TO STAR 
AT RECEIVER AND DEFENSIVE BACK.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forgive Mike Cunningham if his first thought upon learning he would be going to 
Hawaii to play football wasn't of Aloha Stadium. It's just that the chance to 
play there was less a draw to the Edison High School receiver/defensive back 
than the famed bodysurfing at Sandy Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On his first full day in Honolulu, Cunningham spent a couple hours in the 75- 
to 80-degree water at Sandy Beach, riding surf similar to that of Cunningham's 
favorite California bodysurfing break, the Wedge in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen picture after picture in magazines of it and I had to go there," 
Cunningham said. "I stuck to the 7-8-9- (foot wave faces). There was one that 
had to be a 12-footer and I just freaked out and swam as fast as I could 
towards it." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham got under the wave, and a few days later in Aloha Stadium, he 
discovered something else to get excited about: artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
In Aloha Stadium, he found he was able to run his offensive patterns more 
precisely, was able to cover receivers more tightly, and by the time Edison 
completed a 12-0 victory over Honolulu Iolani, he had returned five punts for 
81 yards, caught six passes for 77 yards and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Dave White has come to expect a versatile performance from 
Cunningham, who also played shortstop for the baseball team last season. As the 
Chargers' only returning starter on offense, much is expected of Cunningham 
and, so far, he hasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
After two games, Cunningham, a six-foot, 170-pound senior, leads Orange County 
in receptions with 12, averaging more than 17 yards a catch. His performance 
will likely be a key tonight when the Chargers (2-0), ranked fifth in the 
county, play second-ranked Capistrano Valley (2-0) in LeBard Stadium at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be crazy to not have Mike in the games as much as possible and get him 
the ball every chance we get," White said. 'He likes to have the game in his 
hands, and I like to have it in his hands." 
</P>
<P>
For four games last year, it was out of his hands. On the fourth play of the 
first game of the season, Cunningham jammed his thumb making a tackle. On the 
next play he broke the same thumb when it was driven into the turf while he 
made another tackle. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure proper healing, the break required surgery. It was the fourth surgery 
performed on Cunningham's right arm -- the other three were on his elbow to 
repair damage done when he was a baseball pitcher -- but it was easily the most 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"I really bummed out," Cunningham said. "I was really down. I thought I just 
shot my whole junior year. They said I wasn't going to be back until after the 
Fountain Valley game. That would have been after our seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
But after the initial shock of the injury, Cunningham decided to stay in shape 
by running every day while his thumb healed. 
</P>
<P>
He returned early, missing only three games instead of six. Cunningham caught a 
touchdown pass in each of his first four games back. In the first two, he 
played with an unwieldy, club-like splint on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
But it was against Fountain Valley -- his first game without the splint -- that 
Cunningham made the catch that solidified his status as the Chargers' big-play 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing Fountain Valley, 25-21, with 47 seconds left to play, Cunningham dove 
to catch a 26-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Donnie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He just always makes the play when we need it," White said. "The kids on the 
team know that. I think they are a little in awe of him." 
</P>
<P>
That respect is valuable because Cunningham has taken a leadership role in an 
effort to bring the inexperienced Edison offense up to speed. On defense, where 
Cunningham is one of six returning starters, the Chargers are more sound, 
having given up only one touchdown in two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham sees tonight's game against Capistrano Valley as a chance for Edison 
to get retribution for the 37-10 beating the Chargers took last year in a game 
Cunningham missed because of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
To help prepare for the game this season, Cunningham did something he never has 
done before: He went to see an upcoming opponent play. He watched Capistrano 
Valley defeat Mater Dei, 18-15, Saturday, but it was difficult for him to stay 
in his seat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of envisioning myself going out there," he said. "I was really 
fired up."

TUSTIN'S BORZA BEATS MATER DEI HIS WAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only sparks in Thursday night's game between Tustin and Mater Dei were 
provided by Tustin quarterback Andy Borza. 
</P>
<P>
Borza made all the big plays on offense to give Tustin a 27-3 victory in front 
6,000 at Orange Coast College. Borza scored on runs of 65 and two yards and set 
up a third touchdown with a 38-yard pass to Robert Collier to give the Tillers 
their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Off the field, Mater Dei suffered another loss when running back Derek Sparks 
was not cleared in time to play. A frantic attempt to get approval from 
Southern Section commissioner Stan Thomas to use Sparks failed. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, who gained 1,944 yards at Van Nuys Montclair Prep last season, enrolled 
at Mater Dei on Monday. However, his transcripts lacked a signature from 
Montclair Prep principal Vernon Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
School officials finally obtained Simpson's signature at 7:05 p.m. Thursday -- 
55 minutes before game time -- according to Mater Dei principal Lyle Porter. He 
called Thomas, but the commissioner said the transcripts had arrived too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner requested that we wait another day," Porter said, "and we 
agreed." 
</P>
<P>
So Sparks, who was suited up and prepared to play, could only watch as the 
Monarchs made one mistake after another. Mater Dei (0-2) turned the ball over 
six times, which provided Borza with plenty of scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Borza completed only three of 15 passes for 68 yards, but two completions set 
up touchdowns. He also gained 58 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy really came through for us tonight," Tiller Coach Marijon Ancich said. 
"We made only about 10 good plays tonight and Andy made four of them." 
</P>
<P>
The first came midway through the second quarter after Mater Dei's Rick Ellis 
fumbled to give Tustin the ball at the Monarchs' 21-yard line. On third down, 
Borza rolled to his right and completed a pass to Collier for a first down on 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Borza improvised, taking the snap and diving forward for the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"That's was his own doing," Ancich said. "He saw that the defensive was split 
and just followed the center. We teach our kids to look for those things." 
</P>
<P>
On Tustin's next possession, Borza spotted Collier, who had slipped behind 
defensive back Jim Doone. The 38-yard completion set up a two-yard touchdown 
run by Visko Ancich. 
</P>
<P>
Borza scored again in the third quarter on a 65-yard quarterback sneak, which 
was another ad lib on his part. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Borza, the Tustin offense was contained by the Monarchs. Running 
backs Ancich and Ron Goods were stopped for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Goods, who came into the game as the second-leading rusher in the county, 
gained 39 yards in 14 carries and fumbled twice. Ancich had 40 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tustin kept Mater Dei's offense bottled most of the evening, limiting 
the Monarchs to 84 yards rushing and 232 total yards. Mater Dei got inside 
Tustin's 10-yard line three times, but managed to score only three points from 
those opportunities.

SANTA ANA VALLEY WIN ISN'T PRETTY

<P>
Santa Ana Valley High School's 14-9 victory over Kennedy Thursday night at 
Western High was a sorry-looking mess no matter how you looked at it. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Castanon, Santa Ana Valley coach, looked down on it in more ways than one. 
Perched in the scaffold tower usually reserved for assistant coaches, Castanon 
saw all the Falcons' bumbles and fumbles he might have missed standing on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably the worst victory I've ever had in the 15 years I've been 
coaching," he said. "I'm so upset right now." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Olson, Kennedy coach, opted for the traditional pacing of the sidelines, 
but what he saw was no less pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're young," Olson said. "We do a lot of stupid things." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams made traditional mistakes -- too many men on the field, not enough 
men on the field, holding, clipping, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
But they managed to come up with a few new wrinkles, as when Kennedy's Morgan 
Murakami forgot to pounce on a lateral. Tyrone Barnes of Santa Ana Valley 
smothered the ball at the Kennedy 46-yard line, snuffing the Fighting Irish's 
final drive with 1 minute 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, though, Murakami helped Kennedy almost pull out a victory. He 
caught five passes for 46 yards, including a six-yard touchdown pass from Rod 
Rosales, which cut Santa Ana Valley's 14-2 lead to 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
And just because the game was sloppy didn't mean it wasn't exciting. In fact, 
it may have been exciting because it was sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, James Barclay, Santa Ana Valley running back, had scored 14 of 
the game's 16 points. And that wasn't a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay scored on touchdown runs of two and five yards for the Falcons (1-0-1). 
But he also got tackled in the end zone with 3:45 left in the third quarter for 
a safety, giving Kennedy (1-1) its only points until Murakami's touchdown 
reception with 4:51 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay, who gained 63 yards in 19 carries, also had a seven-yard touchdown run 
called back in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 14-9, with 2:40 left, Kennedy had one last chance to win. The Irish 
drove to the Santa Ana Valley 42, but on first down reserve quarterback John 
Guthrie threw incomplete. He fumbled on second down and after the Irish 
recovered, the play lost 12 yards. A third-down lateral to Murakami seemed 
promising, but he dropped the ball then hesitated just long enough for Barnes 
to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not good enough tonight," Castanon said. "We were good enough to win, 
but not good enough to win a Century League game."

TOP COLLEGE TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN WATER POLO MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the nation's top collegiate water polo teams will join NCAA champion UC 
Irvine in an early season tournament today through Sunday at the Marian 
Bergeson Pool at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked California, which lost to Irvine in the NCAA finals last year, was 
scheduled to compete but withdrew after three students died Saturday in a fire 
at a fraternity house where many of the players were members. 
</P>
<P>
Joining fifth-ranked Irvine are No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Stanford, No. 4 Cal State 
Long Beach, No. 6 USC, No. 7 Pepperdine, No. 8 UC Santa Barbara, No. 10 Fresno 
State, No. 14 UC San Diego and No. 16 Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which lost five starters from last year's team, is not expected to 
repeat as NCAA champion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little chance," said Ted Newland, Irvine coach. "We would have 
to be so damn lucky it would be unbelievable. I'm going to be frank -- we 
should finish somewhere between fourth and seventh (at the NCAA championships, 
later this year)."

TWO MEN BEING HELD IN EMBEZZLEMENT FROM STERLING S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: FBI AGENTS SAY THE PAIR, WHO WERE ARRESTED IN COLORADO, WORKED A SCHEME

Two California men have been arrested near Denver on charges of embezzling $1.2 
million from Sterling Savings &amp; Loan here, according to law enforcement 
authorities and a federal complaint unsealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Dean Knox, 46, of Fallbrook and Richard Russell Holtby, 44, of Murrieta 
are accused of embezzling the money from Sterling Builders Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Irvine-based thrift, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. 
District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, formerly controller of SBI, was arrested Sept. 5 in Englewood, Colo. He 
was using the alias Darrell McCormick and had a loaded .357-caliber revolver 
and several ammunition clips in his possession, according to Jim Donckels, head 
of the FBI's white-collar crime unit in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Holtby, a business associate of Knox, was arrested Aug. 31 in Englewood after 
police stopped the car he was driving for speeding. Donckels said Colorado 
police found a loaded .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, ammunition clips and a 
16-inch machete in Holtby's car. 
</P>
<P>
Knox allegedly issued SBI checks in 1988 to fictitious entities and then had 
Holtby and other friends assist him in laundering the money through several 
bank accounts, FBI Special Agent Dan Ray claims in an affidavit filed in 
District Court. The FBI also claims that the two men sometimes forged the 
endorsement signatures on checks made out to SBI customers and deposited those 
checks in bank accounts they controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a U.S. magistrate in Denver ordered both men held without bail. They 
are scheduled to be transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles. The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has 30 days to seek an 
indictment before the charge of federal bank fraud is dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein said the investigation is continuing. He 
declined to comment further. The criminal complaint was filed Aug. 9, but only 
unsealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About $340,960 of SBI's money was sent to an account named O'Brien Telcom at 
Bank of America, according to the FBI affidavit. Daniel O'Brien, who has known 
Knox for three years, said he set up the account at Knox's request, according 
to the affidavit, which did not further identify O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, Knox approached O'Brien and asked him to help Knox launder funds that 
Knox was embezzling from SBI," the affidavit said. "Knox told O'Brien that he 
would let him keep one-third of the embezzled funds as his share of the 
embezzled and laundered monies." 
</P>
<P>
Besides using banks, authorities claim, the two men cashed at least five SBI 
checks at Colombo's Bar in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
SBI discovered the alleged scheme early this year after making a routine call 
to Larry's Weld-All, a former SBI supplier. During the conversation, Larry's 
was asked to confirm that it had received a $1,590 check made out to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Larry's said it had not received the check and hadn't done work for SBI in 
1988. The check was deposited in a Texas bank where Larry's has no accounts, 
the affidavit said. The FBI then traced the money to Knox and Holtby. 
</P>
<P>
Knox was hired by SBI in 1986 as a computer consultant and promoted to 
controller in January, 1988. He was fired by the end of the year because he 
"had fallen behind in his work and was not cooperating with SBI's outside 
auditors," the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling executives could not be reached for comment Thursday. But they said in 
an interview with FBI agent Ray, recounted in the affidavit, that they would 
ask the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to reimburse the institution 
for the missing $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, which had assets of $162.3 million as of March 31, was California's 
top performing thrift last year based on its return on assets, a major 
barometer of an institution's performance. It earned $6.3 million, which 
amounted to a return of 3.35% on its average assets. In the first quarter this 
year, the thrift earned $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Sterling's profits have come primarily from its real estate development 
projects, investments that thrifts must sell off under a new industry 
regulations. Sterling executives are trying to sell the thrift, without its two 
real estate units. They have been negotiating for more than a year with one 
prospective purchaser.

JAPANESE WILL INVEST UP TO $250 MILLION IN DISNEY FILMMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese investors will pump as much as $250 million into filmmaking at Walt 
Disney Studios under a joint venture announced Thursday between Disney and two 
independent companies, the investment firm of Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown and 
Interscope Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for Nomura Babcock to co-finance films that Interscope produces 
for Disney over the next four years. The movies will be marketed and 
distributed under Disney's three production banners -- Touchstone Pictures, 
Hollywood Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Interscope, which has produced such highly successful fare as "Three Men and a 
Baby" for Disney, has 16 projects in development at the studio. Under the plan, 
Disney will match any investment made by its partners. Nomura Babcock has 
committed to raise at least $50 million through its Japanese clients, but 
executives familiar with the joint venture said the investment will probably be 
much greater. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts pointed out that the cash infusion will significantly reduce 
Disney's risk at the box office. It also comes at a time when the studio is 
stepping up production. Disney, which led all other studios this summer with 
19.9% of the domestic box office receipts, expects to release up to 25 films 
under its three divisions next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Disney has come up with a way to fund external production," said 
Christopher P. Dixon of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "It's exciting for everyone. 
. . . This is yet another example of Disney's focus and ability to come up with 
unique financial engineering techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Disney Studios President Richard Frank said he values the opportunity to 
continue working with Interscope. One of the studio's most successful 
collaborators, Interscope developed "Cocktail" and "Outrageous Fortune" for 
Disney, in addition to "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company, owned by Ted Field, also developed "Bird on a Wire" 
for Universal Pictures this year. Interscope movies have grossed more than $750 
million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Interscope, which is known for light, commercially oriented films, already has 
a "first look" deal with Disney. Under the new agreement, Disney also has the 
option of suggesting projects to Interscope. "The new deal will only finance a 
small portion of our slate," Frank said. "But the most important thing for us 
is that we are still in business with Interscope." 
</P>
<P>
Disney and Nomura Babcock will evenly split all profits from their joint 
ventures after costs are subtracted, under the terms of the deal. Interscope's 
participation was not spelled out, but the company clearly stands to see more 
of its films produced now. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Robert Cort said the deal puts Interscope in an extremely strong 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been a company that struggled to get its movies made," Cort said. 
"But this certainly increases our ability to do that. . . . Our voice is now 
that much stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Interscope also has a strong backer in Nomura Babcock. Founded in 1986, the 
company is 80% owned by Japan's largest securities firm, Nomura Securities Co., 
with the balance held by the U.S. investment banking firm Babcock &amp; Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura Babcock is no stranger to Hollywood. In May it invested $100 million in 
Morgan Creek Productions, another independent film company. Richard Koffey, 
Babcock &amp; Brown's managing director, said discussions over the Interscope 
deal started more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Koffey foresaw no problems in raising the funds from the company's Japanese 
investors, noting that Japanese firms have already made sizable investments in 
such companies as Largo Entertainment and Carolco Pictures, not to mention Sony 
Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this a tremendous transaction to be marketing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes as the funds from Disney's last investment partnership, 
Silver Screen Partners IV, are running out. Disney has realized about $1 
billion from the four offerings. Frank said the company is still exploring 
whether to continue the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, when the stock market was broadly lower, Disney's stock lost 
$2.875 a share to close at $96.25.

U.S. FIRMS TO SHIP SOVIETS BILLIONS OF CIGARETTES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE DEALS REPRESENT BIG BUSINESS FOR PHILIP MORRIS AND R. J. REYNOLDS 
TOBACCO. SHORTAGES IN THE COUNTRY SPAWNED SUMMER PROTESTS.

<P>
Two big U.S. tobacco firms announced Thursday that they will supply billions of 
cigarettes to the Soviet Union, capitalizing on a shortage causing political 
turmoil in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Financial details were not disclosed, but the deals represent significant new 
business for suppliers Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
The companies have been emphasizing sales to foreign countries as the U.S. 
tobacco market has given ground to anti-smoking campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviets, the new shipments will help ease a domestic crisis that has 
caused unhappy smokers to protest in the streets of many cities this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris said the deal was the single biggest cigarette export order in 
the tobacco company's history. 
</P>
<P>
Marlboro and other well-known Philip Morris brands will be part of the order 
that will amount to more than 20 billion cigarettes by the end of next year. 
Shipments by Philip Morris International Inc., a division of New York-based 
Philip Morris Cos., will start at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., a Winston-Salem, 
N.C.-based subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc., said it signed an agreement to ship 
14 billion cigarettes to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Delivery of Winston and other company brands is expected to begin next month 
and conclude by September, 1991, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies also said they will have continuing involvement with the Soviet 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris said it has an agreement to supply additional quantities of 
cigarettes from 1992 to 1995. Under another agreement, it will help Soviet 
agencies develop their domestic cigarette industry. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, R. J. Reynolds noted that it previously announced it would 
participate in a joint venture operation with the Uritsky cigarette factory in 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Financial details of the deals were sketchy. John Dollisson, a vice president 
at Philip Morris, said the company will be paid in hard currency and in counter 
trade items, which he declined to specify. 
</P>
<P>
He said Philip Morris had been in negotiations for "quite some time to get our 
products into the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cigarettes sold in the Soviet Union are expected to be priced at a 
premium to the domestically made brands. Currently, American cigarettes are 
sold on a limited basis in that country, with sales restricted to duty-free 
outlets and stores that accept only hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of cigarettes became so severe in the country this summer that 
rationing was imposed in Moscow, where jars of used butts were being sold on 
street corners for as much as $16. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages of bread and cigarettes earlier this month prompted the mayor of 
Moscow to join a growing chorus of other politicians demanding the resignation 
of Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
The shortages have turned up the heat on the Soviet Union's central government, 
which has been criticized for economic mismanagement. Poor Soviet tobacco 
harvests also have been blamed for the shortage.

GM AND UAW SILENT AS DEADLINE NEARS

As General Motors Corp. and United Auto Workers union negotiators kept silent 
Thursday about progress toward a new contract, some workers sounded anxious. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year national labor agreement, which covers 300,000 workers, expires 
at midnight today. The two sides must reach an agreement by the deadline, 
extend the current contract or the union can call a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is curious," said Dave Perdue, president of UAW Local 276 at GM's 
Arlington, Tex., assembly plant. "They're hungry for information. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of information, the lack of strike rhetoric -- that tells me I should 
anticipate a settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recorded message Thursday for UAW members, union Vice President Stephen 
Yokich said work remains for negotiators who began working on the new contract 
in late July. 
</P>
<P>
"The deadline is quickly approaching, and we must see more movement by the 
corporation if we are to reach tentative agreement prior to the deadline," he 
said. "I urge you to stay in close touch with your local officers about our 
plans as we approach midnight on Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Yokich said most of the bargaining time this week was spent on job security and 
economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
UAW and company officials said only that bargaining continued. Job security, 
wages, pension and health-care benefits were the major issues still on the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
One UAW official said Thursday that negotiators reached tentative agreements on 
a variety of mostly non-economic issues, including attendance policy, health 
and safety and compensation for UAW members called up for active duty in the 
military reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW called a meeting of its GM bargaining council Monday in Dearborn, a 
suburb of Detroit, for local presidents and bargaining committee heads. That 
announcement prompted speculation that negotiators are closer to a settlement 
than a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Union contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which cover more 
than 450,000 active workers, expire at the same time. The UAW has decided to 
focus its efforts for now on GM. Talks with the other two companies are on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
The union plans to make a contract ratified by GM workers a pattern for 
agreements with Ford and Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
GM said Thursday that it had agreed with the International Union of Electronic 
Workers to extend its contract past today's midnight deadline. Either side can 
cancel the extension with three days notice. 
</P>
<P>
The IUE represents about 24,000 workers at GM component plants in Ohio, New 
York, New Jersey and Mississippi.

Gunman's Sons Sue Prozac Maker: The sons of a Kentucky man who killed eight 
others and himself last year sued Eli Lilly &amp; Co., maker of an 
anti-depressant drug that their father was taking. The suit in Jefferson County 
Circuit Court contended that Prozac, touted as the "wonder drug" of the 1990s, 
triggered Joseph Wesbecker's shooting spree. "Mr. Wesbecker had a lengthy 
history of psychiatric disturbance, including suicidal attempts and homicidal 
threats, prior to taking Prozac," said Ed West of Indianapolis-based Lilly.

Bass Disputes Thrift Allegation: Billionaire Robert M. Bass' purchase of failed 
American Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Stockton is saving taxpayers money, said 
Bass Group principal Bernie Carl. 
</P>
<P>
He challenged a House Banking Committee study suggesting it will cost taxpayers 
$4.37 billion, more than double original estimates of $1.7 billion, the Ft. 
Worth Star-Telegram reported. The paper said investigators concluded that it 
would have been cheaper to liquidate at a cost of $3.3 billion. Carl said the 
figures, though accurate, were incorrectly interpreted.

full-blown recession that will last for the next six months, according to the 
UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said they expected real gross national product to decline for 
two quarters, beginning in the fourth quarter, with drops of 2.4% and 3.2%, 
respectively, before recovering again. Such a decline would be the first since 
1982. The forecast predicted an overall GNP growth of 0.9% for this year.

N.Y. Post Talks Sour: Negotiations between unions and the paper's management 
soured Thursday, on the eve of a deadline the Post's owner has set for closing 
the 189-year-old tabloid. Talks with the largest of the unions, the 352-member 
Newspaper Guild, collapsed Thursday but were to resume today. The Post wants

DETECTOR OF PRE-TERM LABOR OKD;

HEALTH: FDA APPROVAL ALLOWS TOKOS MEDICAL CORP. TO BEGIN MARKETING A MONITORING 
DEVICE DEVELOPED FOR WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF PREMATURE BIRTHS.

<P>
Tokos Medical Corp. said it received federal approval Thursday to begin 
marketing a device for detecting pre-term labor in pregnant women with a 
history of premature births. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which is manufactured by Physiologic Diagnostic Service, a small 
Atlanta firm that Tokos acquired 10 days ago for $31.4 million, is the first of 
its kind in the nation to receive pre-marketing approval from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tokos, based in Santa Ana, first announced plans to acquire PDS in June after 
abandoning a three-year effort to gain federal approval for its own 
uterine-monitoring device to provide early warning of premature births. Tokos 
began negotiating the purchase when it appeared that the Atlanta firm was 
nearing final FDA approval for its device, called the Genesis System. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have praised the move as a strategic coup for Tokos that 
could make it the leader in a market with an estimated value of $1.5 billion to 
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 obstetrician-gynecologists in the country already prescribe the 
monitor -- a miniaturized version of monitors used in hospitals -- for use at 
home by women with high-risk pregnancies. Tokos has a national network of 64 
centers that are staffed by nurses who interpret data transmitted from uterine 
monitors by telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
The monitors, which are strapped to patients by a belt, can detect an unusually 
high incidence of contractions, signaling a need to administer drugs or take 
other action to prevent premature birth. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the monitors have been hampered by the refusal of some major insurers, 
including Medicaid, Blue Cross and Prudential, to reimburse patients for 
pre-term labor monitoring devices pending FDA approval. Until now, uterine 
monitoring devices had FDA marketing approval for use only during full-term 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
Under the FDA's approval Thursday, Tokos will be allowed to market the device 
only to women with a history of pre-term labor but not to women with other 
kinds of high-risk pregnancies, such as those in which the mother is expected 
to give birth to more than one child. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously delighted," Tokos President Craig T. Davenport said of the 
FDA's action. "We anticipate that this pre-market approval will lead to 
expanded prescriptions for our service."

Hilton Hotels Sees Lower Net: The Beverly Hills-based hotel chain said that, 
based on results for July and August, net income from operations for the third 
quarter is expected to decline about 50% from the comparable 1989 period. 
</P>
<P>
Net income from operations for the 1989 quarter was $30.5 million. It blamed 
the decline on lower gaming revenues at the Las Vegas Hilton due to increased 
competition. Hilton stock closed at $29.25 per share in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, down $2.25.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: DON'T BET ON JUST ONE HORSE IN THIS RACE

With Houston's oil-driven economy collapsing all around him in 1984, 
restaurateur Bob Borochoff was determined to survive. He bought and sold eight 
restaurants while times were tough but realized that he needed a long-term 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
So, in addition to his Boston Sea Party Restaurant, he set up Epic Catering to 
keep his chefs and kitchens busy during slow times and created Epic Special 
Events to stage celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
By taking the people and equipment he already had and deploying them in new 
ways, Borochoff has built a thriving, three-part small business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely convinced every small business can diversify," he said. 
"Everyone who survived the Texas oil bust did it by diversifying." 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners around the country should consider diversifying into new 
product lines or services as America girds for an economic slowdown. The secret 
is to make changes without having to spend a lot of money or add new employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to look at your strategic plan and see if it still makes 
sense," said Anthony Radaich, partner in charge of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s 
enterprise group in Woodland Hills. He suggests that business owners assess 
their companies' strengths and weaknesses and figure out the best way to 
capitalize on their strengths. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Radaich said, a client with a metal plating business boosted sales 
by setting up a second shift to do contract plating jobs for other firms. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Camarillo-based California Amplifier realized that its 
dependence on military orders for its microwave amplifiers was hindering 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"When it became obvious the government business wasn't going to help us grow, 
we refocused our efforts into what was a small part of our business -- the 
commercial sector," said Barry Hall, chairman and chief executive of the public 
firm, which had sales last year of $11 million and employs about 130. 
</P>
<P>
"Business people have to accept the fact that while they made money one way in 
the past, it won't be the same in the future," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the success of the diversification, California Amplifier recently sold 
its military products division to focus entirely on providing equipment to 
satellite dish manufacturers and television stations. And, Hall said, the 
company has turned around the quarterly loss it suffered a year ago, and this 
quarter is showing a modest profit. 
</P>
<P>
"A manufacturer has to make sure he has taken all the juice out of his 
products," advises Pamela Roth, president of P. J. Roth &amp; Associates in Los 
Angeles. "You should see if the products you make could be changed slightly to 
appeal to a broader market." 
</P>
<P>
Roth, a marketing consultant, has helped several small businesses turn around 
through diversification. One firm, which produced cosmetics for Latinas, 
broadened its advertising campaign and product literature to appeal to women of 
different ethnic types. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the change with little or no investment after identifying a larger 
market for the products," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-business owners selling things over the counter should also look into 
selling them in catalogues or through direct mail," said Roth. "You have to 
think broadly today because target marketing can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen's Radaich also recommends looking at your equipment and 
vehicles to see how they can be better used. For example, if you are sending 
your products out on trucks all day, maybe you can haul another company's 
products back to your city at night. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a machine shop, why not ask fellow business owners if you can do 
any work for them? In the same vein, see if you can send a part of your work 
out to others so you don't have to buy expensive new pieces of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And, if possible, seek out other business owners to perform tasks for you, so 
you don't have to hire new people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DIVERSIFYING YOUR BUSINESS 
</P>
<P>
* Revise your business plan to prepare for an economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
* Look at new or different uses for your equipment, vehicles, buildings, etc. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask your customers what new services or products you could provide to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut costs by farming out projects to other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
* Discuss new business possibilities with your vendors or suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider what other consumers could use your products.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Thursday that it will provide free 
facsimile service at its 400 U.S. phone sales centers for families and friends 
wishing to send messages to U.S. military personnel in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The "Desert Fax" service, which will begin Sept. 21, is being introduced at the 
request of Sen. Alan Cranston, (D-Calif.), who also asked MCI and US Sprint to 
provide such a service. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said the duration of Desert Fax "will depend on several factors, 
including cost, volume of messages and benefits to military personnel and their 
families." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Edgerton, MCI vice president for government systems, said his company was 
meeting Thursday with Defense Department officials to consider a range of 
services to Middle East forces, including facsimile and electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint spokesman Jim Crawford said his company was considering installing 
more phone lines, electronic mail service and video conferencing.

Bob Jamieson has resigned as executive vice president of Polygram Holdings 
Inc., the New York-based music concern that is 80% owned by Polygram N.V. in 
the Netherlands. He will become an outside consultant to the holding company, 
whose subsidiaries include Polygram Records, A&amp;M Records and Island 
Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
The Polygram announcement came a day after former RCA Records executive vice 
president Rick Dobbis joined Polygram Records, reportedly to direct a 
restructuring involving the label's marketing, sales distribution and promotion 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Alain Levy, Jamieson's boss who was recently selected to become president and 
chief executive of Polygram's worldwide music group, said that he had no plans 
to fill Jamieson's position. Polygram Records is reportedly in the midst of 
separating its Mercury and Polydor operations into free-standing labels. JUBE

HOME BUILDER J.M. PETERS HAS FIRST LOSS IN 3 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: COMPANY SOLD ONLY 79 HOMES IN SECOND QUARTER, DOWN 75.5% SINCE LAST 
YEAR. SALES OF NEW AND RESALE HOMES HAVE BEEN DROPPING STEADILY IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA FOR MONTHS.

<P>
High-price home builder J.M. Peters Co. reported Thursday its first loss since 
going public in 1987 and said it sold only 79 homes in the second quarter, down 
75.5% from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Peters reported a loss of $451,000 for the three months ended Aug. 31, 
contrasted with net earnings of $3.5 million for the second quarter of its 
fiscal 1990. A year ago, the company sold 322 homes in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company's poor performance reflects the sharp slowdown in the Southern 
California housing market. The slump is clear in permits sought by builders. In 
July, only 569 construction permits were issued in Orange County -- the lowest 
monthly total since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial results are reflective of the continued downturn in sales for 
single family move-up market housing in most areas of Southern California," the 
company said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that sales of new and resale homes have been dropping 
steadily in Southern California for months, a buyer reaction to high prices and 
growing consumer concern about the national and regional economies. The crisis 
in Iraq has shaken consumer confidence further as recession and inflation fears 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is one of the county's best-known home builders and one of only a 
handful of publicly traded residential developers in the nation. The company 
specializes in luxury "move-up market" tract homes in the $350,000 to $500,000 
price range, which makes it particularly vulnerable in bad economic times. 
</P>
<P>
Its sales revenue from escrows that closed in the second quarter plunged nearly 
10% to $51.1 million from $56.6 million a year earlier. The company said it was 
hurt by increased finance and marketing costs on homes and land in various 
stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is not the only builder with problems. Neil Dimick, Costa Mesa-based 
national director of real estate services for the international accounting and 
consulting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche, said the industry -- which has been 
struggling for much of the year -- sustained a tremendous blow in August when 
Iraq seized Kuwait and set the world teetering on the brink of war and economic 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
He said builders and subcontractors have been laying off workers for most of 
the past month, and estimated that Southland construction payrolls are down 
about 15% since mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
But Dimick said he believes home builders will fare better in the current 
economic crunch than in the recession of the early 1980s because there are 
fewer homes built and standing empty now than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, is because most builders had seen the warning signs and began 
cutting production months ago. The cutback showed up dramatically in July when 
the Construction Industry Research Board reported a large statewide drop in 
residential building permits. Dimick said he believes the number of permits 
issued in August will also be well below the norm. 
</P>
<P>
"What Peters hit is the same wall most other builders, except those doing 
entry-level homes, have hit," Dimick said. "Because it is public and has to 
report its finances, Peters has visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know 10 other builders in as bad or worse shape that aren't public. 
There are a lot of boards of directors meeting these days to try to decide how 
to get rid of homes." 
</P>
<P>
People have quit buying homes because they no longer are confident of the 
economic future, said Barbara Allen, housing analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; 
Co. in New York. Allen on Thursday downgraded her recommendation on Peters 
stock from "hold" to "sell." 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock price, which had been edging upward in recent weeks, 
dropped 62.5 cents a share Thursday, down 16% to $3.25 a share as word of the 
quarterly loss spread. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she now believes there is a good chance Peters might post its 
first-ever annual loss when its current fiscal year ends Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
She said she believes the U.S. economy plunged into recession in the middle of 
the second quarter and that things are worsening, particularly for home 
builders, whose high-ticket products are at the top of the list of things 
people quit buying in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears, in talking to most of the companies that I follow, that July and 
August were really bad months, and (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein didn't 
help," Allen said. "The Middle East situation made the number of home sale 
cancellations go way up because of buyers' uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
She said officials at Peters have told her the company had one more 
cancellation than sale during the past four weeks, for "net sales of minus one 
home." 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of the quarter, Peters said it had a backlog of 197 homes 
contracted for but not yet out of escrow, down 64.3% from a backlog of 552 
homes at the end of its fiscal 1990 second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Value of the company's backlog of orders as of Aug. 31 was $70.9 million, down 
70% from $236.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the industrywide drive to move properties by slashing prices, Peters 
said its gross profit margin on housing sales in the second quarter fell to 
14.8% from 19.7% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a home in Peters' Aug. 31 inventory was $359,898, down 
from an average of $428,985 the previous year.

Construction Statistics: The slowdown in office construction in Orange County 
has also been noticed by the Construction Industry Research Board, which 
gathers building statistics for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, says the board, construction of office buildings is down almost 
everywhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, permits for office construction dropped by a third in value 
during the first seven months of the year, from $210 million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Store construction was up in the county, as it was across the state. But 
construction of industrial buildings fell in the county, the board said, by 
about 22%. Last year, local governments issued permits for $70 million worth of 
industrial construction, compared to $54 million in the first seven months of 
1990.

OFFICE LEASING RATE EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY 20% DURING 1990

Last year, tenants leased a record 4.4 million square feet of additional office 
space in Orange County, but a local real estate consultant is estimating a 20% 
drop in the rate at which office space is occupied this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Slower economic growth rates both nationally and in Southern California have 
impacted the expansion plans for a number of firms," said Robert Dunham, 
president of the Newport Economics Group in Newport Beach, in a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham said absorption of office space dropped from an all-time high of 2.6 
million square feet during the first half of 1989 to 1.8 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that rate, the consultant expects absorption this year to be 3.5 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been gaining an average of 52,000 jobs a year, but only 
30,000 new jobs are expected to be created this year. But the news is not all 
bad for landlords, according to the report. Most of the decline is in 
manufacturing and construction, while office users are still showing modest 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
And construction is also slowing down, which means the area's high vacancy 
rates may also decline some. In fact, Dunham says the rate edged down to around 
17% during the first half of the year. About 10 million square feet of office 
space were vacant. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 3.4 million square feet of space under construction now, says 
Dunham, "the lowest level in many years." Roughly five years ago, there were 7 
million square feet of space under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Still, rents remain low, the report says, averaging about $1.75 to $1.85 per 
square foot per month in major high-rise office buildings.

Melvin Jaffee's day in bankruptcy court Thursday marked both an end and a new 
beginning for the former president of National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James N. Barr approved the sale of the once-thriving home 
improvement chain's two remaining stores Thursday. Jaffee will pay about $1.3 
million for a store in Cathedral City, and Builders Emporium will buy an 
Encinitas store for about $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I was able to keep one store," said a misty-eyed Jaffee, who accepted 
congratulations from people in the courtroom after the proceedings. He said he 
was sorry that the National Lumber employees in Encinitas would lose their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only thing I feel bad about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee, 56, had wanted to buy both stores. With his father, he spent almost 
half a decade building the home improvement chain, which had 21 stores when it 
filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 3. Barr ordered the 
Fountain Valley company liquidated on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The court allowed Jaffee to retain non-exclusive rights to use the National 
Lumber name. 
</P>
<P>
Wickes Cos., the parent of Builders Emporium, agreed to pay $1.3 million cash 
by noon today for the Encinitas store, which will be operated as a Builders 
Emporium store. It also bought an option to acquire the lease of a closed 
National Lumber store in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said he plans to refurbish the store in Cathedral City, which is near 
Palm Springs. He also acquired the store's inventory and two storage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia-based Lumber City, which had been bidding for the Cathedral City 
store, pulled out of the negotiations Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord of the Encinitas store, Mitsui/SBD America Fund, held up an 
agreement earlier this week by objecting to Jaffee retaining the lease on that 
store. Mitsui said it was concerned about Jaffee's proposed financing.

Rising car sales offset a drop in light truck purchases as sales of North 
American-made vehicles edged up 2.4% in early September, auto makers said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Some blamed higher gasoline prices for the decline in truck sales. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 major companies making cars in the United States said they sold vehicles 
at an average daily rate of 31,065 units during the Sept. 1-10 period, compared 
to 30,333 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales for the period were up 6.7% while truck sales dropped 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. crept up 
just 0.8%, while sales of cars made by Japanese companies in North America 
jumped 81.9%. 
</P>
<P>
A 6.8% slide in light-truck sales overwhelmed the car-sales increase for an 
overall 2.2% decline for the Big Three in the 10-day period.

LIFESTYLE: HOW HIGH CAN HOME PRICES GO ON SECLUDED HARBOR ISLAND? MAYBE TOO 
HIGH, SOME LONGTIME RESIDENTS SAY.

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture the island: a part of Newport Beach that can be walked end to end in 15 
minutes -- less if you don't stop to gawk -- but oh, so private and hard to 
reach. Signs on Bayside Drive direct motorists away from this little jewel, and 
access is via a bridge wide enough for only one car at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the houses have private docks. Although there is public access from 
the water, once someone gets from the water onto the island, he's on private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the houses feature swimming pools or tennis courts. Most are built on 
lots in the 5,000- to 9,000-square-foot range. 
</P>
<P>
This is tiny Harbor Island, where decades ago lots went for $5,000 -- or $2,500 
if a house was built on the property within a year of purchase. Now it's the 
home of the $9-million tear-down, and, foot for foot, it may be the priciest 
enclave in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
One family owned two lots from 1928 through 1989. Title to the property then 
changed hands four times in 18 months; two men who paid $6.6 million in May, 
1989, sold it eight months later for about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those two lots once belonged to Gladys Gardiner, who was called by one friend 
"the island newspaper" because of her interest in the latest goings-on. She was 
a gregarious woman, friendly and outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
The current owner is just about the opposite, a man with such a penchant for 
secrecy that he bought the property through an agent in January, keeping his 
name off public records until July. 
</P>
<P>
The new buyer? Donald Bren, president and owner of the Irvine Co. and the 
county's only known billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, who also has homes in Holmby Hills and on Linda Isle and an apartment in 
New York City's tony Pierre Hotel, joins such Harbor Island residents as George 
Argyros, developer and former owner of the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's purchase of the Gardiner property comes amid a spate of building and 
remodeling in this community of only 25 or so homes, some of them, like Bren's, 
built on double lots. For some, the recent boom, with homes routinely selling 
for $5 million and up, signals the end of an era, a time when island residents 
may have been nearly as rich as sheiks but weren't quite as flashy about it. 
</P>
<P>
For a spot that once was the summer home of violinist Jascha Heifetz and held 
an estate of Howard Ahmanson, the banker whose name lives on at the Ahmanson 
theater, part of the Los Angeles Music Center, Harbor Island started modestly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The property was dredged and filled in the 1920s, after Balboa Island and Lido 
Isle, and developed by Joseph Beek and Louis Briggs. Beek's son, Allan, said 
three or four people lived on the island in the early days, including Gladys 
Gardiner and her husband, Everett, whom everyone called Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Gardiner "was a college chum of my father" at what is now Caltech, Beek 
said. "It was a typical rich-boy, poor-boy relationship. My dad was poor, 
working his way through school. Everett had inherited wealth, but they became 
strong friends." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner, whose parents lived on the Balboa Island property that Beek said was 
later bought by actor Buddy Ebsen, had degrees in law and engineering but never 
worked in either field. He was, however, a tinkerer. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Gardiner built himself a car, "a little, open, four-sided 
wooden thing with wheels on it and an electric motor," recalled Jean Watt, who 
grew up on Harbor Island and still lives there. With gasoline tightly rationed 
during the war, Gardiner used the electric car "to go over to Balboa Island and 
around town," Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Isle, then called Shark Island and not yet developed, was known as a 
fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes, Watt said. So Gardiner poured oil on 
the ponds where the insects would otherwise flourish. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids liked to go down and chat with Gladys," Watt said. "We called her 'the 
island newspaper.' She was the one who knew what was going on. She was the one 
you could count on to know why the ambulance came on the island. And Duke was 
the one you could count on to fix something if it was broken. They were really 
the guts of the island." 
</P>
<P>
Duke Gardiner died in 1960. Gladys continued her volunteer work for the 
Assistance League of Newport Beach well into her 90s. As the years went on, she 
grew concerned about rising property taxes and inflation, her friends said. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, she deeded her house to Hoag Hospital, which let her live in it for 
the rest of her life and paid her $10,000 a month in return for inheriting the 
property. In January, 1989, she died of heart problems, leaving an estate of 
$800,000 -- half of which went to Caltech, the rest to charities and friends -- 
and the house. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, property values in Orange County were going wild. 
</P>
<P>
One parcel that Beek recalls his mother sold for about $300,000 in 1972 or 
thereabouts -- a good chunk of change for that time -- now is valued at $6.9 
million by the county assessor. Another home is priced for sale at about $15 
million (reduced from the original price of more than $17 million, according to 
real estate agents). Properties bought in the last few years routinely show 
assessed values of $3 million, $5 million, $9.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
One 15,000-square-foot house boasts two elevators, one at each end, to make it 
easier to get from the basement to the first and second floors. The owner said 
that workers pumped 15,000 gallons of water a minute for eight months to lower 
the water level enough to pour the concrete for the basement. 
</P>
<P>
But as prices have increased, the sense of community has decreased, some 
old-time residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a great place," said Larry Porter, 44, who grew up on the island 
but, with his siblings, sold the family property three years ago after his 
parents died. "But now it's, well, like everything in general has changed. The 
flavor of living in Southern California now (has changed). The island is kind 
of a fortress for, in my opinion, people who are somewhat insensitive of the 
way they've been economically blessed." 
</P>
<P>
In bygone days, "there was an island Christmas party," said Porter, who now 
lives elsewhere in Newport Beach but is thinking of moving out of the area. The 
atmosphere year-round, he said, was one "where you waved to your neighbor, you 
liked your neighbor. You wouldn't hesitate to borrow something from someone. 
Nowadays, they don't even talk to each other over there." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Watt is less harsh but agrees that in the old days "we had more 
neighborhood kinds of things going on. Now it's kind of everyone does their own 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
"My father would have described it as 'Everyone has too much money,' " said 
Watt, a longtime community activist and co-founder of the environmental group 
Stop Polluting Our Newport, which had notable success in limiting noise from 
planes at nearby John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Today's islanders seem to be "interested in getting more money, building bigger 
houses and getting more cars," Watt said. "It's just gotten to be one of those 
places where, like a lot of others in Newport, they feel that every square foot 
has to have something built on it because it's worth more money that way." 
</P>
<P>
Winifred Voegelin said that, with all the recent changes on the island, "you 
kind of hunker down." She has lived there for 40 years; she once hosted, with 
her late husband, a lawyer who for years was an officer for the Los Angeles 
Area Chamber of Commerce, an annual lawn party for the Los Angeles consular 
corps, followed by a Newport Bay cruise that started and ended at the dock on 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
Although the recent flurry of building and remodeling bothers resident Hansel 
Benvenuti, a retired doctor, he finds things on the island in general pretty 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors are "friendly but keep to themselves," he said. And the property 
has appreciated quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years ago, Benvenuti paid $275,000 for the lot; he figures it cost 
about $600,000 to build the house. He estimates the package is now worth about 
$5 million. "I couldn't afford to buy it today," he said. On the other hand, he 
figures he can't afford to sell it, because of capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Benvenuti's wife, Martha, a retired lawyer, said many people look at Harbor 
Island without knowing what it is they're seeing. "They see the homes from the 
water, and they don't know where they are," she said. She especially treasures 
her garden and "my view of the bay every morning when I wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Though parking is a problem, requiring the Benvenutis to hire a valet when they 
have a party, she said Harbor Island remains "a private place for people who 
want privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hamilton, head of the island's community association, moved there from 
Corona del Mar four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be on the water with a big yard, relatively speaking," Hamilton 
said. "There are not many places on the water with yards. It's one of the 
beauties of Harbor Island that everybody is restricted; they cannot build out 
close to the sea walls, so they have large yards, big setbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton was a co-owner of what is now the Bren property for a while, buying it 
from Hoag Hospital for $6.6 million with Jim Peters, another home builder. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Lowell C. Martindale Jr., a lawyer for O'Melveny &amp; Myers, 
bought the property on behalf of Bren. None of the principals would say what 
the price was, but county records show its value at $9.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton did say that the purchase offers were "so attractive" that he and 
Peters scrapped plans to raze the Gardiner residence and build two homes for 
themselves on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Martindale said it's "a possibility" that Bren opted to use an agent lest the 
sellers see the billionaire coming and jack up the price. Also, he said, "Mr. 
Bren, for such a prominent figure, is a private person and would probably 
prefer to keep his personal affairs private to the extent he can." 
</P>
<P>
Martindale said Bren plans to tear down the Gardiner residence and build a new 
one. That means he could wind up with the highest-priced property on Harbor 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, one home -- a part of the old Ahmanson estate -- sold for about $14 
million, and it's still under construction. The other home on the Ahmanson 
property, which was divided after his death, is up for grabs at somewhere 
around $15 million.

BEATING MEN AT THEIR OWN GAME;

<P>
FOOTBALL: THE WIFE OF USC'S COACH HELPS WOMEN UNDERSTAND THE INS, ENDS AND OUTS 
OF THE SPORT BY TEACHING THEM SOME THINGS EVEN THEIR MENFOLK MAY NOT KNOW.

It was Thursday night football and Smith of USC was making the coaching calls. 
Cheryl Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the group had been lured by a newspaper ad: "Ladies . . . tired of not 
knowing the difference between a tight end and a free safety? Cheryl Smith, the 
woman behind USC head football coach Larry Smith, can help . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 35 women had gathered in a room at Descanso Gardens in La Canada for 
"Football for Women," session one of a four-evening clinic for which each had 
paid $75 to learn more about this peculiarly American pastime -- college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a vivacious, silver-haired woman of fortysomething, set the tone. The 
idea, she said, was for the women to be able to tell their husbands and 
boyfriends and sons something about football that the men don't know and 
"pretend that they do." 
</P>
<P>
She added conspiratorially, "It just blows them away." 
</P>
<P>
Pencils and note pads came out as Smith dispensed a few nuggets of football 
trivia: 
</P>
<P>
* The first college football game was played Nov. 6, 1869, between Rutgers and 
Princeton. Neither team had uniforms, but Rutgers players wore scarlet stocking 
caps. Rutgers won, 6-4. "You'll need to know," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
* In the early years of the game, a down was five yards and failure to make the 
yardage in four attempts resulted in a 10-yard penalty. "Write this down," 
Smith said, "because they don't know this." 
</P>
<P>
She drew a rectangle on the chalkboard, dissected it with horizontal lines, 
then with vertical lines. Voila! A grid, as in gridiron. Smiles of 
comprehension brightened her students' faces. She smiled. "I'll bet they don't 
know that, either." 
</P>
<P>
 By evening's end, these women would know the dimensions of a football field, 
the job description of the "three little men" in black-and-white striped shirts 
(the linesmen), the height of the goal posts and the width of the crossbars. 
</P>
<P>
The women got a good look, close up, at a football. One raised her hand and 
asked, "Why do they have laces?" Probably to give the passer a better grip, 
Smith reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
In future weeks, these women would learn about offense and defense and split 
ends and wishbones and options. But tonight's session was an overview -- a 
little football history, some football lore and a Smith anecdote or two. 
</P>
<P>
She started these seminars 10 years ago in New Orleans, when her husband was 
head coach at Tulane, she explained, because women were always saying, "Well, 
we know your husband coaches on Saturday, but what does he do the rest of the 
week?" This is the first year she has offered them in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Part of her goal, she said, was to present the "human side" of players and 
coaches. She explained that, on non-game days, there are films to be 
scrutinized -- those of USC's most recent game and those of the next opponent. 
There are player performances to be evaluated, practices and more practices. 
Off season, there are fund-raisers and recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell you, coaches' wives do not have to know how to cook," Smith 
said, explaining that coaches rarely make it home for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
When the Trojans travel, she goes, too. When there are Saturday home games, 
Coach Smith bunks Friday night with the team -- Cheryl Smith calls the players 
"our kids" -- and she doesn't see him until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
The women listened intently. Some have sons who are high school players. They 
had questions about letters of intent and eligibility rules and redshirting 
(the practice of letting a player play four years within five consecutive 
years, giving him his freshman year to mature physically and emotionally). 
</P>
<P>
It was coffee-break time. Jeanette Nuss laid down her notebook and confided, "I 
know nothing about football, and my son (Chad) plays at Loyola High. Something 
defense. I only know his number." Nuss said she goes to all his games but "I 
never know who has the ball. My husband refuses to sit next to me. He'll say, 
'You're cheering for the wrong team!' " 
</P>
<P>
Sue Coplin, who's in videotape marketing, explained that she was here because 
"my fiance (Tom Kanarian, a Warner Bros. executive and USC alumnus) is an avid 
SC fan . . . .I thought I'd like to talk intelligently" about the game. 
</P>
<P>
As class resumed, Cheryl Smith stepped out of her tiered red jersey skirt to 
reveal something akin to knee-length underwear. She peeled off her red top and 
there was a maroon and gold USC T-shirt. She wiggled into a pair of gold 
stretch football pants -- "I'm not going to tell you what size they are, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
Into pockets in the funny-looking underwear she slipped thigh pads and knee 
pads and hip pads. "I sure don't need those," observed a well-padded woman in 
the audience. Perhaps, Smith said, but "the men don't have a lot of fat around 
there like we do." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she would observe that football shoulder pads, which resemble the armor 
of an armadillo, were not designed with bosoms in mind, either. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for more football trivia -- the kind they don't know: One man's 
football gear, dry, weighs about 25 pounds. To outfit each player costs between 
$750 and $1,000, including four different pairs of cleats -- for grass, 
Astroturf, dry weather, wet weather. 
</P>
<P>
In case anyone was wondering, she said, the rules don't specify whether a 
player's name will be on his jersey, along with his number. "Larry doesn't 
believe in (it)," she said. "His theory is we're not a team of individuals," 
but a team. 
</P>
<P>
She pulled on an elbow pad and an arm pad, explaining, "The big problem with 
artificial turf is rug burns." 
</P>
<P>
One woman, having watched Smith gearing up, observed, "I thought puttin' on a 
girdle was bad." 
</P>
<P>
Another, taking in the pounds of padding, asked, "What does this tell you about 
the game?" 
</P>
<P>
Smith produced a maroon Trojan helmet with a built-in air cushion and wiggled 
it up and down on her head. Too loose, she said -- "That's how you get broken 
necks." Some of the mothers of football players winced. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have trouble hearing inside that helmet?" someone else asked. "A 
little," she said. "That's why the quarterback yells." 
</P>
<P>
Class was over. "Come ready to work" next week, Smith told the women, promising 
"some heavy-duty plays." 
</P>
<P>
Coming to this seminar was a matter of "survival," explained Rosalina Brennan. 
"I really am a football widow. I'm the only girl in the house." Her son, David 
Bayha, played two years on the Loyola High team and plans to be back next year. 
"I worry, I really do," she said. "It's really dangerous. But it's so much a 
part of high school life." Loyola parents, she said, have a name for the 
required parental consent form -- "We call it the death letter." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Smith, who's been married to Coach Smith for 25 years, said the idea of 
"Football for Women" hit her when, in the South, she "saw a lot of women who 
hated football and knew nothing about the game and just got dragged along 
because it was the social thing to do. They sat through four hours and it was 
boring, awful." 
</P>
<P>
When Larry Smith went to the University of Arizona, where he stayed seven years 
at head coach, she offered the seminar each year. 
</P>
<P>
When women learn the game, she said, they are "the most vocal and supportive 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
Her own introduction to football came early: "I grew up in a neighborhood with 
all boys. It was either fight 'em or join 'em. I was the dumb girl who didn't 
know anything." 
</P>
<P>
She is married to a man who "lives and dies this game" and, she said, this is 
her way of sharing that passion. They met when she was a senior dance major at 
Ohio State. Smith, then a high school coach, came to a coaching clinic offered 
by the legendary Woody Hayes. Cheryl Smith was helping at registration. Seven 
months later, they married. 
</P>
<P>
Her knowledge of football at the time did not go much beyond differentiating 
between offense and defense, but she asked her bridegroom a lot of questions -- 
and she learned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
When she decided to teach "Football for Women," she went to her husband for 
help. "We sat for hours and he diagrammed plays for me." Until then, she said, 
"I thought I knew a lot" about football. 
</P>
<P>
She is still learning. If a woman asks a question she can't answer, she jots it 
down and "I go home and ask Larry." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl and Larry Smith are the parents of a 19-year-old daughter, Ali, and a 
son, Corby, 17, a senior who quarterbacks the Loyola High team -- and plans to 
play college football. At USC? "It depends," she said, "on where he's 
recruited." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the Smiths dash from a USC afternoon game to a Saturday night Loyola 
game. If Loyola is playing while USC is on the road, Cheryl Smith stays home. 
"There's only one high school career," she said. "There'll be a lot more SC 
games." 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday, it will be USC vs. Penn State at the Coliseum. Cheryl Smith will 
be in her customary seat, about 20 rows behind the Trojan bench, in "yelling 
position. I do a lot of yelling. . . . " She laughed. "They probably don't hear 
me. I probably do it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
If USC, ranked nationally in the top 10, wins, Larry Smith may come home happy 
-- and he may not. "Sometimes," she said, "he'll win a game and come out 
snarling. Sometimes he loses, and he's just fine." It depends, she said, on 
whether the players and coaches did "their very best." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the Monday morning quarterbacks will have their say -- Cheryl Smith 
among them. "I'm the coach's wife," she explained. "I'm allowed to do that."

JOSEPH N. BELL: AT 19, HE AIMS TO BE A CITY FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young people are taking a lot of heat -- and rightly so -- these days for their 
avid disinterest in public affairs, including a dismal voting record, so when 
one comes along who takes the opposite tack, it seems worthy of note. That's 
why I drove down to San Juan Capistrano the other day to visit with Gerhard 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is one of 14 candidates for three seats on the San Juan City Council. He 
is also a 19-year-old sophomore at Saddleback College who is concerned that the 
voters of that community take his candidacy the same way he does: seriously. 
</P>
<P>
We talked outside the Dana Point Harbor coffee bar where Peters has worked for 
more than three years, currently as manager. He puts in a 40-hour week there, 
carries a full academic load at Saddleback -- and managed a 3.6-grade-point 
average last year. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him when he finds time to campaign, and he explained: "I'm off school 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I also have Friday and Sunday mornings free." He 
made it sound as if that were ample time to carry out his self-appointed 
mission of trying to knock on the door of every registered voter in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 13,000 registered voters here," he said matter-of-factly, "and 
realistically I expect to get to about one-third of them personally." 
</P>
<P>
He probably will, too. There's a kind of quiet determination about him that 
makes converts and belies his obvious youth. He's thin, of modest height, has 
straight brownish hair neatly parted with the hint of a cowlick, wire-frame 
eyeglasses, a high thin forehead, and a kind of wry humor that pokes 
occasionally through the layers of earnestness. Although I haven't made a 
study, I suspect that -- if elected -- he would be Orange County's only city 
councilman wearing braces on his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
But he would probably find that observation flippant, as well he should. 
"People don't know who I am when I knock on their doors," he said, "but most of 
them have been real nice to me. A few gave me a kind of astonished look because 
I'm so young, but they didn't say it. 
</P>
<P>
"One man told me he was excited to see a young person so involved. Another guy 
invited me in and asked me to tell him about things I'd like to do in the city. 
A lady talked to me for a half-hour, asking me questions, and then when I had 
answers she kept probing. Nobody's been hostile, and only a couple of people 
have said they didn't want to talk and shut the door." 
</P>
<P>
Peters admits that there aren't any terribly controversial issues on the local 
scene -- except, perhaps, "development in historically sensitive areas," on 
which he has "a moderate position; I support non-intrusive development." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly he is learning the political lingo. But instead of attacking his 
opponents -- none of whom he has yet met -- he would like his candidacy to be 
seen as an affirmation of youth. 
</P>
<P>
"The community," he says "has a misconception about young people. My peers are 
a lot more politically aware than they used to be. They have opinions, but they 
don't feel comfortable expressing them in the field of politics where they feel 
intimidated by older people. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe we have the potential at any age to be anything we want to be, 
and I'd like to be an inspiration to people my age. At first, they thought this 
was a crazy idea, but now they respect me for it. I think, for example, it's 
important to have an anti-drug member on the council who is young. I'd fight 
that much harder. I have a real interest in what goes on here, and the best way 
to make things happen is to do them yourself. They could use somebody my age on 
the council." 
</P>
<P>
Peters says he arrived at this place pretty much by himself, without a 
political mentor either at home or at school. His mother, who is German (hence 
the "Gerhard") met and married his father when he was stationed with the U.S. 
Army in Germany. They were divorced about 10 years ago, but Gerhard's father 
lives in Costa Mesa and gets together often with his son. Gerhard's stepfather 
is a Marine captain who has been in charge of recruiting activities at several 
sites in this area, making it possible for his family to put down roots for the 
past seven years in San Juan, where his mother is an executive secretary for a 
local industry. 
</P>
<P>
According to Peters, he didn't get involved in campus politics either at Dana 
Hills High School ("the student government didn't have much to say about what 
went on there") or at Saddleback College. He chose instead to put most of his 
extra curricular energy into the 4-H Club, where he says he was into 
"leadership and citizenship." 
</P>
<P>
He has a hard time coming up with a political role model but finally singled 
out John F. Kennedy, not so much because he believed in Kennedy's political 
philosophy ("I'm rather conservative"), but because "Kennedy appealed to the 
younger people." Peters reflected on that a moment, then added, "But I'm not 
modeling my life after anyone." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have a political organization, although he said that several of his 
friends have offered help, "but I like to put myself out front." He's a little 
hard to pin down on his future because it depends on whether or not he wins, 
and he doesn't care to speculate on what he'll do if he doesn't win. 
</P>
<P>
He's making it clear that he will run for only one four-year term "because if I 
don't get it done in four years, it won't get done -- and besides, I don't 
think politicians should get too comfortable in office." As a councilman, he 
would expect to continue his education at either UC Irvine or Cal State 
Fullerton, majoring in political sciences with an emphasis on international 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The only time he showed any mild rancor was when he referred to a whimsical 
comment by the current San Juan mayor -- who will be running against him -- 
that both his children are older than Peters. "So why don't they get involved?" 
asked Peters a little testily. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is thinking about a fund-raiser but doesn't see the need for it yet. You 
see, he saved up $50 to finance his campaign and the day before I talked with 
him had visited a local print shop and discovered that he could reproduce all 
the single-sheet flyers he needs for $30. So his campaign fund is still 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
He was also carrying a stack of voter registration forms, which he says he has 
with him at all times in case he runs across an unregistered voter. I was 
pleased to be able to tell him that I'm already registered. And I'd also be 
pleased to have Gerhard Peters knock at my front door.

STYLE: HARDLY CHANGING THE CHANEL

<P>
Karen Rockwell and Sally Cain stood poised before the new Chanel boutique, 
waiting impatiently for the thick glass doors to swing open and admit the first 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that great jacket -- oh, God," said Rockwell, peering through the 
glass. She had driven from her home in Rolling Hills Estates on Monday morning 
to see the new Chanel store in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting a whole year for this," said Cain, a Huntington Beach 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Orange County store means that Chanel aficionados will no 
longer have to travel to the boutique on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills for those 
precious quilted handbags or silk-lined suits, the kind with gold chains sewn 
into the hems so they hang just so. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we travel, we look for the closest Chanel," Cain said. "We've been 
to the boutiques in Paris, Monaco and Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
The new boutique offers virtually everything found in those in Beverly Hills or 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell and Cain, who wore Chanel earrings and toted Chanel handbags for the 
occasion, were among the first to enter the gleaming interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Inside they found elegant mirrored walls with black lacquer trim that have been 
duplicated in Chanel boutiques worldwide. A pale apricot-colored carpet 
cushioned customers' feet, while spotlights shone down on them from above. 
</P>
<P>
Sales clerks, all impeccably dressed in their Chanel uniforms, stood behind the 
spotless glass counters. A hostess in a white apron brought out orange juice on 
a tray. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, 20 or so customers had fanned out among the high-gloss displays 
of artfully arranged merchandise and an occasional keg-size perfume bottle. One 
customer already inhabited a plush dressing room with walls covered in beige 
suede, while a saleswoman hurried in and out with wool jackets and cashmere 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, who quickly singled out a black satin hair bow to add to her Chanel 
accessories, said the new boutique compares favorably to others she has 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she said. "It's smaller than some, but it's a really well-stocked 
store." 
</P>
<P>
Some customers came not to shop but to ogle the boutique. 
</P>
<P>
"I was anxious to be here, to be one of the first ones in the store. I've 
studied the evolution of apparel and (Coco) Chanel has always been one of my 
favorite designers," said Bernadette Granados of Newport Beach, a graduate of a 
fashion design school who seemed content just to wander around the boutique. 
</P>
<P>
"I've followed Chanel's story -- she started out in hats," said Granados, who 
wore a broad-brimmed straw hat with gold trim and a red jacket and shorts 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"Chanel has a clean look -- it will always be in style," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many shoppers had never seen the inside of a Chanel boutique. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the name Chanel forever," said Irma Alt, a 70-ish resident of Santa 
Ana. "I've never been in one of the stores. It's very classy, very 
rich-looking. Some of the styles don't appeal to someone my age, but they do 
have something for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The boutique stocks a broad assortment of the entire Chanel collection, 
including the ready-to-wear collection designed by Karl Lagerfeld, an array of 
quilted leather handbags, long gold chains studded with faux pearls and gems, 
and Chanel's line of shoes, belts, watches and skin-care products. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel's fall line features velvet jackets in rich jewel tones such as purple 
and red with black velvet trim on the pockets and cuffs for $2,140, coupled 
with a short velvet skirt with a chain detail bordering the hem for $860. 
</P>
<P>
There's a red wool coat-style dress with a black velvet collar and 
</P>
<P>
gold buttons for $2,390, or a quilted silk parka with black satin trim and gold 
buttons, for about $2,800. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel suits start at about $2,000, yet even at those prices the competition 
for an especially hot style can be intense, attracting long waiting lists of 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The new boutique has 3,600 square feet of selling space, making it the third 
largest Chanel store. It's the 11th boutique in the country, and the first to 
be placed in a mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for a second Southern California location for two or three 
years," said Barbara Cirkva, senior vice president of the fashion division for 
Chanel Inc. in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Orange County's super development and growth, we thought this was 
the place we should be. The boutique works in this mall because South Coast 
Plaza is really a city in itself." 
</P>
<P>
To fit into the mall, designers had to create a single-story boutique. Other 
Chanel stores on the U.S. mainland have two or three stories. 
</P>
<P>
A few Chanel veterans said they missed the boutique's famous mirrored stairway. 
Copies of the stairway in the original Paris store on Rue Cambon have become a 
fixture of Chanel boutiques worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chanel has never occupied such a huge space on one floor, according to 
Cirkva, and the new boutique lacks none of Chanel's distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you walk in, you feel you're in that environment and look Chanel 
created," she said.

When Doug and Melanie Peterson want to get away from it all, they don't look 
much farther than their garage -- where their bikes are stored. For these 
working Irvine parents with two children and high-stress jobs, a romantic 
getaway is a 500-mile bicycle tour through Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Rosenkrantz, a 37-year-old veterinary dermatologist, talks dreamily about 
riding down the coast from San Francisco to Laguna Niguel -- just for the fun 
of it. But short of that, he settles for getting up before dawn every day to 
ride the roads of South County before returning home to help his wife bathe, 
feed and clothe their three small children. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Chasteler is on his bike by 6 a.m. and back within the hour -- to help his 
wife, Pat, get their two sons and a daughter ready for the day. Later in the 
week, it's his turn to watch the children as his wife takes off on her bike. 
</P>
<P>
Busy people with jobs and children and pressures and so little free time. 
People who don't have a moment to spare, but who somehow find the time to train 
and to enjoy their bikes. Here's how some of them do it, and why. 
</P>
<P>
Name: Wayne Rosenkrantz. 
</P>
<P>
Age: 37; married (Vicki), three children. 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Veterinary dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
Bike club: Laguna Hills Bike Club (Bicisport). 
</P>
<P>
Miles per week: 150. 
</P>
<P>
Bikes owned: Calborn, Columbus SLX tubing, Shimano 8-speed Dura Ace hyperglide; 
KHS Triathlon Pro Bike; Calborn mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite ride: A 36-mile loop from Laguna Hills to Laguna Beach, north on Coast 
Highway through the Newport Back Bay and back, at a very fast pace. 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Birthplace: Bronx, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not tending to his veterinary dermatology clinics in Garden Grove, 
Santa Monica and San Diego, or changing his 1-year-old's diapers, or taking his 
son to soccer practice, Wayne Rosen-krantz can be found on his black custom 
Calborn racing bike attacking the hills of Santiago Canyon or flying down Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
For Rosenkrantz, juggling his passion for riding with family and a demanding 
business schedule is not an option: it's a must. And if that means rising at 
5:30 a.m. to be on the road every day by 6:30 a.m., then so be it. 
</P>

"Cycling helps dissipate mental stress and puts me in a much better frame of 
mind each day that I ride," he said. "I'm lucky that my wife and family 
understand my need to have time to cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my cycling is done early in the morning before my family even wakes 
up. During the workweek I try to ride early, prior to work, or occasionally 
I'll cycle to and from work. On weekends I often ride longer in the mornings 
and try to ride with one or more of the family members in the late afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenkrantz, forever fiercely competitive, said he got into cycling by 
competing in triathlons and learning, quickly, of his innate strength on a 
bike. He joined the Laguna Hills Bike Club, sponsored by Bicisport Bicycles, 
and within months had ordered a custom Calborn racing machine with 
top-of-the-line components. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started cycling with the current bike club, I thought I was in 
good shape. But after getting dropped (left behind by the pack), I realized 
there was a lot more technique involved, in addition to strength and 
conditioning. I am a very competitive individual. Cycling provides an excellent 
outlet for competition. The club I ride with attracts many good competitive 
riders. Some even race competitively. In addition, the camaraderie associated 
with my fellow riders is very special." 
</P>
<P>
Known among fellow bike club riders as the "Dog" because of his profession and 
tendency to attack hills with the aggressiveness of a pit bull, Rosenkrantz has 
seen himself become the stereotypical bike fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to my fanatic cycling interest, I used to think the bright bizarre 
jerseys, shorts and helmet covers were worn only by bike nerds. I also swore I 
would never shave my legs. But now I am the epitome of what I thought I would 
never be: the ultimate bike nerd. But somehow it all seems quite natural."

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Birthplace: Long Beach (Steve); Oceanside (Theresa). 
</P>
<P>
If you doubt Steve Nelson's commitment to cycling, consider this: Both he and 
his wife hold down full-time jobs, they have two small children and day care to 
think of, and still he finds time to serve as president of one of the largest 
bicycle clubs in America -- the Orange County Wheelmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it rewarding. You meet so many nice people through the club (the Orange 
County Wheelmen) and it gives you a chance to do what you love," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Nelson has been riding off and on since 1972 and has been putting in 
strong, consistent miles since 1982 when he and Theresa started looking for a 
sport they could enjoy together. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried jogging, a health club, swimming and things like that. We finally 
hit it on cycling. Riding is something you can work hard at, you create a 
breeze by yourself, you change scenery and it can be a social event with good 
exercise. Plus, if you ride enough miles you can eat anything you want. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a very high-stress job. Since I've started riding, my blood pressure 
has dropped from 150 to 110, and my pulse went from mid-70s to low 60s. I stay 
riding consistently to maintain good health." 
</P>
<P>
Steve tries to ride three to four times a week, sometimes riding his tandem 
with his wife or pulling his children along in a bike trailer. Most of his 
riding is done with the Wheelmen and with other couples in the club. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he said, he will ride with a friend while their wives baby-sit the 
children. When the men are through, the women go off for an hour's ride while 
the men baby-sit. 
</P>
<P>
"It works out well," he said. "You have to make adjustments, find the time, if 
you want to keep riding." 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage, he said, is the promise cycling holds for maintaining his 
fitness through the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good friend in the club who is in his late 70s, and I plan to 
continue until his age. As long as you are careful, there is nothing damaging 
about riding. My wife rode during both pregnancies. She was seven months 
pregnant and she did a century (100-mile ride)." 
</P>
<P>
"So as far as I'm concerned, I'll be riding forever." 
</P>
<P>
Name: Joe Chasteler. 
</P>
<P>
Age: 32; married (Pat), three children. 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Building trades journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
Bike club: Orange County Wheelman. 
</P>
<P>
Miles per week: 100 to 120. 
</P>
<P>
Bikes owned: Orbit, Reynolds 531 tubing, Campy components; Peugeot racing bike; 
Dawes Tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite ride: The Laguna Loop, 30 miles, from Irvine down Laguna Canyon Road 
and north to the Back Bay and back to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Birthplace: Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
When Joe Chasteler noticed the middle-age spread appearing around his 
waistline, he knew it was time to get back on the bike. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 17, we were putting in 200 miles per week. But then I stopped. I 
got married, got a car and the whole shot. Then I put on some weight, and I 
knew I needed to exercise. When I got back into riding, I realized how much I 
missed it." 
</P>
<P>
That was almost four years ago and, for Chasteler, there has been no looking 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"The bike offers freedom, being out in the fresh air, and going the slower pace 
than a car, you can see the scenery. You are alone with yourself and the 
environment. You slow down and smell the daisies. Plus the physical exercise 
you get out of it. You can get out there and really hammer and it hurts, but 
the next day you feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Chasteler is a morning person, up at 5:30 a.m. and out the door to ride within 
30 minutes. He's home within an hour and off to work. On the weekends, the 
Chastelers team up with Steve and Theresa Nelson, also members of the Orange 
County Wheelmen, to hire a baby-sitter to watch their children as they ride. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to budget your time carefully if you want to keep riding," Chasteler 
said. "You have to be committed. 
</P>
<P>
"The family really enjoys the cycling too. If they didn't like it, there could 
be a problem. But in our club, we try to emphasize the family outings. We are a 
real social club. We are not a racing club. We can go on a ride but then have a 
meal after it." 
</P>
<P>
Name: Doug Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Age: 40; married (Melanie), two children. 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Palco Linings, Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Bike club: Irvine Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
Miles per week: 120. 
</P>
<P>
Bikes owned: Trek 1500 with Shimano 600 components; a Kuwahara Tandem; Fisher 
mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite ride: Ventura to Santa Barbara and back via Casitas Pass, a 70-mile 
loop. 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Birthplace: Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Peterson talks about cycling as if it were some kind of spiritual 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just so much about it I enjoy," Peterson said, "that I hardly know 
where to begin. But the single most enjoyable part of it is that when you are 
out riding you are mentally occupied just with that. It gets you away from 
daily stress and pressures. It is a little time off where you don't have other 
things intruding in your mind. You're not worried about work or the boss." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson tries to ride three or four times a week, mostly in the afternoon just 
before dinner. His wife, Melanie, also is an avid cyclist, and on weekends they 
hitch up the bike trailer and make it a family outing. The special times, 
however, are when the couple can ride alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people go out to dinner and have some wine, but we get out in the fresh 
air and get in a good workout. It's just like a date. The only problem is we 
have to get a sitter at 8 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Like others, Peterson enjoys the physical benefits that come from staying on 
the bike. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get in shape and have the basic aerobic capacity, it is not that hard 
to do," he said. "I will never quit riding. It is part of my lifestyle. We have 
people in our club in their 60s and 70s who are very active. That's what I 
really like about this sport: a person with average genetic athletic talents 
can perform effectively probably longer than you can stand up."

<P>
Football (and cheerleading) fans can catch the UCLA and USC squads in action 
Saturday when the schools play home games. USC will go against Penn State at 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Spotter: A cheerleader who assists with any tumbling stunt or in the building 
or dismounting of a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>

REVELATIONS FROM A LIFE OF TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sensuous and vibrant, "Etchings in an Hourglass" is an intensive course in 
lifemanship written by a woman with a remarkable capacity for love, work and 
friendship. The third and last volume of Kate Simon's autobiography, this book 
concludes the saga begun in "Bronx Primitive" and continued in "A Wider World": 
the story of a child brought to America as a tot, her sensibility shaped first 
by the stark realities of tenement life, then honed by the intellectual rigor 
of Hunter College, enlarged by the cultural opportunities of New York, 
broadened and deepened still further by travel. 
</P>
<P>
Simon became a multilingual citizen of the world, at home in France, Italy, 
England and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
She's best known for her books on the places where she happened to alight and 
settle. During her long sojourns, she invariably succeeded in immersing herself 
so thoroughly in the life of her chosen country that the revelations astonished 
natives and visitors alike. There are 10 such books, each filled with the 
thoughts, perceptions and appreciations of a woman who could never have gone to 
sleep at night without having learned something new that day. 
</P>
<P>
This book is considerably more personal than the ones upon which her reputation 
has rested; more poignant and candid even than the earlier autobiographical 
volumes. Here Simon concentrates upon family, friends and lovers, the profound 
connections and casual encounters that punctuated her peripatetic career. 
</P>
<P>
We learn of a tragic early marriage to a young scientist whose deafness was 
caused by a genetic brain tumor, a flaw inherited by Simon's only child, a 
daughter who died at 22. As a second marriage promising tranquillity and 
consolation disintegrates and fails, the author finds relief and challenge in 
extensive travels, the journeys culminating in the superb European and Mexican 
books, then doubling back to the delights of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Once returned, she applied the same rigorous techniques used abroad, exploring 
her own city with the eagerness and enthusiasm of a total stranger and the 
specialized knowledge of a resident connoisseur. Along the way, there are 
lovers embraced with passion and occasional liaisons evolving from a simple 
zest for adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Simon had an uncommon willingness to gamble on a safe and happy ending, a trait 
rare among women of her generation and background. More often than not, her 
risks were rewarded, contributing to her understanding of an entire culture and 
enlarging her knowledge of her own selfhood. She not only acknowledges these 
escapades wittily and frankly, but writes about them with the same grace, 
elegance and gusto she applies to the Renaissance masterpieces of Florence or 
the bridges across the Seine. Though she never apologizes, she does explain, 
earning the reader's admiration. Written as her health was deteriorating in her 
last years, "Etchings in an Hourglass" has little artificially imposed 
structure. Instead, incidents are recalled as the author thinks of them, in 
order of importance. Because her images are so arresting, her depth of field 
impressive and her style so fluid, a clear pattern emerges to give the memoir 
cohesion and power. Early widowhood, the subsequent marriage for intellectual 
rather than emotional reasons, the almost simultaneous deaths of her daughter 
and a beloved sister are in retrospect the pivotal events that gave Simon's 
life purpose. Who wouldn't yearn to flee the scene of such tragedies? But few 
could transform escape into a splendid, disciplined and enduring body of work.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fashion Group of Los Angeles hopes to call attention to local talent when 
it showcases nine areas of L.A. design in one grand-scale fund-raising gala, 
"LookWest '91," Sept. 24. Honorees for the $75-per-ticket affair include such 
international trend-setters as David Hockney, restaurateur Wolfgang Puck and 
wife Barbara Lazaroff, architect Jon Jerde, graphic designer April Greiman, 
advertising mogul Jay Chiat, fashion photographer Philip Dixon, and a mystery 
honoree in the field of entertainment. Expect to see the clothing designs of a 
record number of L.A. talents -- close to 150 -- in a mega-fashion show 
previewing spring '91. Proceeds will benefit the Rudi Gernreich scholarship 
fund. For details, call (818) 985-5477. 
</P>
<P>
PROTECTIVE COLORING: Listen received an update on Mary Rimdzius, who escaped 
from Kuwait after she dyed her California blond locks a deep shade of Bedouin 
brunette with India ink and a dark brown tint, slipped into long robes and 
crossed the border. Rimdzius, who is staying in Long Beach with her daughter, 
was anxious to get back to her blond roots. After six hours of retinting and 
highlighting at Bezzetti's Master Colorists in Beverly Hills, Rimdzius' tresses 
were restored free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
WHO ARE THOSE MASKED PEOPLE?: Grace Jones, Barbara Carrera, Janet Leigh, Cicely 
Tyson and Ozzy Osbourne were the odd fellows behind the facial masks recently 
at the Georgette Klinger Salon on Rodeo Drive. They all dropped in to try 
Klinger's new treatment, Line Solution Facial. 
</P>
<P>
TAILORED FILMMAKING: Giorgio Armani and Martin Scorsese will close the Venice 
Film Festival Sept. 15 with "Made in Milan," the lastest Armani/Scorsese 
collaboration. The 26-minute documentary is about Armani and his fashion 
business. The film was written by Jay Cocks, former film critic for Time 
magazine, and filmed by cinematographer Nestor Almendros. Armani does the 
narration. "Made in Milan" will be released in the United States at the end of 
October. 
</P>
<P>
A BUSH IN THE BIZ: If you think buying clothes is sheer material expression, 
you haven't purchased anything with the Karitas label in it. The collection is 
a project of the Karitas Foundation, a nonprofit organization that benefits 
children. And the force behind it is one of President George Bush's 
daughters-in-law, Sharon Bush. (She's married to Bush's son Neil.) She's 
coordinating efforts to raise money for homeless and abused children through 
the sale of clothing manufactured for the label by Bull Frog and Gund, among 
others. Look for the Karitas label at Nordstrom, Sears and J.C. Penney stores. 
</P>
<P>
HOT ROCK WEAR: We haven't seen the clothes yet, but we like the name: Red 
Rocker Hyper-Active Wear. The man behind the catchy label is Sammy Hagar, lead 
singer of the heavy-metal group, Van Halen. His "loose, fun, casual" clothing 
for men (cloned from his own stage wardrobe) will be introduced Sept. 18-20 at 
the Action Sports Retailer Convention in San Diego. If all goes as planned, the 
"moderately priced" Red Rocker line will be in stores by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
MODELING MATILDA: Olivia Newton-John and Pat Farrar, co-owners of 13 Koala Blue 
boutiques (the other 45 are licensed), will come out of the fashion closet this 
fall to appear in ads and catalogues for the company. This is the first time in 
the five-year history of the Van Nuys-based concern that the duo has gone 
visual with their line. Gloria Teague, chief executive for Koala Blue, says 
Newton-John and Farrar, both in their early 40s, "should be very effective, 
because they're our customer." 
</P>
<P>
POLO AND AUTOS: Ralph Lauren came up with another winner recently, only this 
was one he didn't design. His 1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic (a car) took the 
Best of Show Award at the 40th Annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (a car 
show). Knowing Lauren's penchant for infusing Americana into his clothing line, 
Listen won't be the least bit surprised if the Ralph Lauren models are wearing 
long travel dusters and goggles on the runways next season. DO NOT CROSS: David 
Quirk, an enterprising fashion design student at Iowa State University, has 
developed a line of clothing made entirely of orange plastic police barricade 
tape. Quirk says the folks in Aimes, Iowa, don't appreciate the nuances of his 
designs and mistake him for a traffic cop whenever he wears his special suit. 
So he sent photos of his creations to some of his favorite people -- Arsenio 
Hall, novelist/screenwriter Hanif Kureishi and MTV's Downtown Julie Brown to 
name a few -- hoping they would understand his sartorial vision. But it may 
even be too much for the hipsters. Arsenio Hall's wardrobe person liked the 
all-plastic-tape suit, but the star passed on it. Julie Brown's only response 
was an autographed picture of herself.

<P>
New Kids on the Block operated like a true American industry Wednesday night at 
the Pacific Amphitheatre: The kid-pop phenomenon from Boston made plenty of 
money, but it wasted a great deal of energy. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable resource was on hand waiting to be harnessed -- a sold-out house 
of nearly 19,000 fans, the vast majority of them deeply infatuated young girls 
just tingling with energy. 
</P>
<P>
New Kids, the object of one of the most pervasive outbreaks of puppy love in 
pop history, didn't have the foggiest notion how to focus that abundance of 
adoration and make it explode. Oh, the girls screamed like little Beatlemaniacs 
the whole time (Southland sales of candy-flavored cough drops and throat 
lozenges should be humming this week, what with New Kids' two sold-out Pacific 
shows and a big outing at Dodger Stadium tonight). But this was a crowd primed 
to scream at almost anything -- when stage hands made some pre-show adjustments 
to a tarpaulin covering the set, that alone caused an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of concentrating and multiplying their fans' hysteria, the five New 
Kids gradually drained it during a plodding two-hour show that wasted 
considerable time on disorganized patter and antics. The New Kids have been 
accused of being just cogs in a well-oiled machine wound up by Maurice Starr, 
the entrepreneur who put the group together and has written and produced 
virtually all of its music. Maybe the New Kids, who range in age from 17 to 21, 
figured that a tightly organized, quick-paced performance would confirm that 
they are just pale markings on their producer's blueprint for a white Jackson 
5. 
</P>
<P>
So they decided that the way to establish some personality of their own was to 
hang loose, investing the show with a playground feeling that involved lots of 
yakking and hollering, not to mention interminable stretching of songs. 
</P>
<P>
The chief slacker was stubble-faced Donnie Wahlberg, who carved out an 
oh-so-calculated bad-boy persona. Wahlberg played the kid with the worst 
attitude in class, the one who always got the girls tittering with his 
deliberately obnoxious antics. But he went overboard and managed to make 
himself truly obnoxious. At one point Wahlberg picked up a stuffed toy tossed 
his way as a gift offering and heaved it back into the audience with this 
peeved admonition: "You oughta stop throwing things." Maybe the fans and their 
parents ought to stop throwing away money on New Kids paraphernalia bearing 
this lout's likeness. 
</P>
<P>
New Kids launched most of its best ammunition at the start, with fire-pots 
flashing, lasers glowing, and all five members engaging in some energetic 
hoofing. But after a brisk opening 15 minutes or so, the time-killing began 
with a long, laborious introduction of the group's five-piece backing band. 
After that came an extended series of solo and duo turns by all the New Kids 
except oldest member Jonathan Knight, a serious candidate for the Andrew 
Ridgeley Award for superfluous presence in a pop act. The show offered only a 
handful of flashy, tightly crafted ensemble song-and-dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
If there's any real promise cocooned in New Kids, it lies with Jordan Knight, 
the 20-year-old singer who carried most of the show's musical load. Knight, the 
handsomest and by far the most talented New Kid, turned in a solid performance 
that showcased a generally assured falsetto, some limber dance moves and an 
appealing, earnest personality. 
</P>
<P>
Knight had a few rocky moments vocally, but he shone in comparison to what 
</P>
<P>
surrounded him. Danny Wood was gratingly off-key most of the time. Wahlberg was 
somewhat better than that, but his pitch was iffy too, and his grainy voice was 
only slightly less unpleasant than his manner. Wahlberg and Wood were in charge 
of giving New Kids' a rap dimension -- a shrewd division of labor, considering 
their singing abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Curly-mopped Joe McIntyre, the youngest and cutest New Kid, apparently is too 
ancient and husky-voiced now to pull off the imitations of a pre-pubescent 
Michael Jackson that have fallen to him on record; in concert, most of his 
numbers were strung together in a solo medley, suggesting that full versions 
would have taxed his ability. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from this show, accusations of lip-syncing leveled against the New Kids 
have been exaggerated -- or perhaps those accusations have caused the group to 
become more honest. As the abundant flaws made clear, this singing was live, 
except for some incidental (though still unacceptable) use of taped backing 
vocals during the more fevered dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Before anyone starts congratulating New Kids for their probity, though, it 
should be noted that the show was preceded by a video-screened fast-food 
commercial, courtesy of the New Kids' tour sponsor. Remember just a few years 
back, when the mere appearance of a corporate logo on a banner was considered a 
sellout? If the public doesn't express a distaste for commercials in concert 
venues, we're sure to see more of them. 
</P>
<P>
An alertness to such marketing opportunities -- which are vastly greater today 
than they were for the Monkees, the Partridge Family and other teen idols of 
the past -- has turned New Kids into a cash cow generating hundreds of millions 
of dollars. It could be that increased parental guilt in a two-earner economy 
has something to do with the band's income explosion as well. 
</P>
<P>
But no amount of money can turn the New Kids' sweet-nothing songs into 
something. Puppy love -- whether lost, found or sought -- was the group's main 
subject, expressed in a way that lacked any shading of complexity or emotional 
depth. The only departures were "Hangin' Tough" and "Games," which appropriated 
the familiar us-versus-them theme of heavy metal, "us" being the New Kids and 
their fans, "them" being all those who question the group's ability and staying 
power. The show also included a treacly ballad, "This One's for the Children," 
that paid lip service to caring -- presumably for the less fortunate -- without 
bringing up any unpleasant particulars. 
</P>
<P>
Starr's savvy for clean, catchy musical settings patterned after successful 
models (the Beatles on "Tonight," for example, and Stevie Wonder's sugary side 
on "Funny Feeling") may allow New Kids to keep reeling in fans and raking in 
dollars for a while. Of course, there's something to be said for getting 
pre-adolescent audiences interested in music -- any kind of music. But lacking 
songs with expressive peaks, songs that speak for the singers themselves, it's 
hard to imagine New Kids on the Block ever being able to hit any peaks in live 
performance. It's also hard to imaging them mattering in five or 10 years to 
the masses of kids who scream for them now.

LOW-VOLTAGE OUTING FOR NEW KIDS;

<P>
CONCERT: THE POP PHENOMENON FAILS TO HARNESS THE ENERGY OF AN ADORING SOLD-OUT 
AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Kids on the Block operated like a true American industry on Wednesday at 
the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa: The kid-pop phenomenon from Boston made 
plenty of money, but it wasted a great deal of energy. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable resource was on hand waiting to be harnessed -- a sold-out house 
of nearly 19,000 fans, the vast majority of them deeply infatuated girls just 
tingling with potential energy. 
</P>
<P>
New Kids, the object of one of the most pervasive outbreaks of puppy love in 
pop history, didn't have the foggiest notion how to focus that abundance of 
adoration and make it explode. Oh, the girls screamed like little Beatlemaniacs 
the whole time. But this was a crowd primed to scream at almost anything -- 
even the stagehands' pre-show adjustments to a tarpaulin covering the set 
caused an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of concentrating and multiplying their fans' hysteria, the five New 
Kids (who headline Dodger Stadium tonight) gradually drained it during a 
plodding, two-hour show that wasted considerable time on disorganized patter 
and antics. Maybe the group's members, who range in age from 17 to 21, figured 
that a tightly-organized, quick-paced performance would confirm that they are 
just pale markings on their producer Maurice Starr's blueprint for a white 
Jackson 5. So they decided the way to establish some personality of their own 
was to hang loose, investing the show with a playground feeling that involved 
lots of yakking and hollering, not to mention interminable stretching of songs. 
</P>
<P>
But pacing and high energy were New Kids' only hope. With its repertoire of 
Starr-written sweet-nothings that skim the surface of teen romance, this bunch 
certainly wasn't going to climb any expressive peaks on the strength of its 
material. 
</P>
<P>
The chief slacker was stubble-faced Donnie Wahlberg, who spent considerable 
time carving out an oh-so-calculated, bad-boy persona. He quickly went 
overboard and managed to make himself truly obnoxious. At one point, Wahlberg 
picked up a stuffed toy tossed his way as a gift offering and heaved it back 
into the audience with this peeved admonition: "You oughta stop throwing 
things." Maybe the fans and their parents ought to stop throwing away money on 
New Kids paraphernalia bearing this lout's likeness. 
</P>
<P>
The New Kids launched most of their best ammunition at the start, with 
fire-pots flashing, lasers glowing and all five members engaging in some 
energetic hoofing. But after a brisk opening 15 minutes or so, the time-killing 
began with a long, laborious introduction of the group's five-piece backing 
band. After that came an extended series of solo and duo turns by all the New 
Kids except oldest member Jonathan Knight, a serious candidate for the Andrew 
Ridgeley Award for superfluous presence in a pop act. 
</P>
<P>
If there's any real promise cocooned in New Kids, it lies with Jordan Knight, 
the 20-year-old singer who carried most of the show's musical load. Knight, the 
handsomest and by far the most talented New Kid, turned in a solid performance 
that showcased a generally assured falsetto, some limber dance moves and an 
appealing, earnest personality. Nobody else in the group came close to cutting 
it vocally. Danny Wood's grating, off-key singing was about as bad as it gets 
on a major stage. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from this show, accusations of lip-syncing leveled against the New Kids 
have been exaggerated -- or perhaps those accusations have caused the group to 
become more honest. As the abundant flaws made clear, this singing was live, 
except for some incidental (though still unacceptable) use of taped backing 
vocals during the more fevered dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Before anyone starts congratulating New Kids for their probity, it should be 
noted that the show was preceded by a video-screened McDonald's commercial, 
courtesy of the New Kids' tour sponsor. Remember just a few years back when the 
mere appearance of a corporate logo on a banner was considered a sell-out? If 
music fans don't express a distaste for commercials at concerts, we're sure to 
see them all the time.

CLINT EASTWOOD'S ACID TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You see, movies are all foolishness . . . an exercise in insanity . . . pure 
madness. . . . But, as we're in this thing, well, we might as well bluff our 
way through to the bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Wilson, in Peter Viertel's "White Hunter, Black Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Films about moviemaking often veer between honey and gall: the sweetness of 
self-celebration, the acid of iconoclasm. In "White Hunter, Black Heart" 
(citywide), Clint Eastwood reaches for the acid. He's adapted a famous, bitter, 
backstage roman a clef: Peter Viertel's scalding fictionalization of events 
leading up to the making of "The African Queen." And he's cast himself in its 
great central role: violently self-indulgent filmmaker John Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is modeled on John Huston, and the movie is a marriage of seeming 
opposites. In 1953, when Viertel wrote "White Hunter," Huston was a rebel and 
Hollywood outsider. The book -- which Viertel may have intended partly as 
vengeance for a bad time and partly as a plea for a reckless, brilliant talent 
to recover his own balance -- is a little poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is shown as a sublime egotist, stranding his company in the Belgian 
Congo, while he scours the plains in pursuit of the "big tusker," the 
magnificent bull elephant he wants as a trophy. Viertel's surrogate character 
-- screenwriter "Pete Verrill" (played in the film by Jeff Fahey) -- is the 
self-conscious voice of sanity and reason. And the characters obviously modeled 
on Sam Spiegel (George Dzundza's Paul Landers), Katharine Hepburn (Marisa 
Berenson's Kay Gibson) and Humphrey Bogart (Richard Vanstone's Phil Duncan) are 
stunned or somewhat helpless bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
Reading or watching "White Hunter, Black Heart," it's hard to imagine that "The 
African Queen" was made at all -- much less that it became a major box-office 
hit, Oscar-winner and well-beloved classic. Now, almost four decades later, we 
see John Huston and his film -- even his obsessions -- in a different light. 
Huston may have seemed a semi-legendary rogue in 1953. After his death, he's a 
legend, pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
The moviemakers play on this -- even quoting actual dialogue from "The African 
Queen" during the Wilson-Verrill script sessions and inventing a sequence where 
Wilson takes the Queen on a test run and almost sends her over Victoria Falls. 
Inevitably, a little reverence glazes over the criticism. Plot and dialogue are 
intact -- "Hunter" lists Viertel as one of three screenwriters -- but the tone 
has shifted. It becomes, more clearly, Wilson's tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood, playing Wilson, takes the biggest gamble of his career. He doesn't 
play a new conception of Wilson, or Eastwood-as-Wilson. He actually plays John 
Huston. He imitates the vocal timbre, the loose, aimlessly expansive hand 
gestures, the mockingly grand manner, the avuncular "Hey, kids." Occasionally 
the impersonation works shockingly well. In two scenes, when Wilson grins at a 
soccer match or slumps exhausted after another unsuccessful hunt, the 
resemblance is almost eerie. 
</P>
<P>
But it's erratic. The mix of mannerisms is distracting; it might have been 
better to soft-pedal them, take the role deeper inside. Sometimes, Eastwood 
seems to be weaving languid gestures in the airy, arch manner of a Restoration 
fop; he doesn't drink in interlocutors with his gaze the way Huston would. The 
voices are a weird blend: Eastwood's light and pinched, where Huston's was a 
slightly cracked organ, wheezing out ironic toccatas in a mash of Ohio drawl 
and pure stage blarney. 
</P>
<P>
If profligate, eloquent, life-gorging Huston was, for James Agee, "one of the 
ranking grasshoppers of the Western Hemisphere," considerate Clint seems his 
opposite: the model citizen, the ant. (Verrill is his more natural part.) Yet, 
beneath every ant's skin, a grasshopper's heart may secretly beat, and vice 
versa -- something Eastwood's "Bird" also suggested. This split is reflected in 
the movie's spare, visually laconic style. It doesn't dwell on the landscapes, 
the sun, the vibrant life around Wilson. Instead, it zeroes in on the 
characters and conflict, fixes them in a cool, hard gaze that verges on the 
clinical. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter" is a movie about an obsessive artist, a moviemaker -- but the 
story's dark joke is that the artist isn't obsessed with his own work, the 
movie he's about to shoot. He's obsessed with the movie he's made of his life: 
the willful, outrageous character he's created for himself. Like the classic 
American adventurer of literature, he's pulled back by his community -- the 
film crew -- and his "wife," the alienated screenwriter, trying to keep him on 
the set and out of the savannah. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a patriarch of flamboyant jokes, is a God who seems driven to become 
his own Lucifer. But the movie also make it clear that he's a secret moralist, 
a portrait that jells most strongly during Wilson's quietly furious put-down of 
the anti-semitic Mrs. McGregor (Mel Martin), and his challenge of a burly hotel 
manager who's been maltreating black servants. They're ferocious scenes, 
impeccably acted. And they connect Wilson to Eastwood's previous roles: fantasy 
heroes who actually deliver on their quixotic gestures. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter, Black Heart" was not a great novel -- in some ways, it's not 
even a good novel -- but it's always been first-rate movie material. And 
perhaps it's wrong to complain that Eastwood hasn't made a perfect version of 
it. The ideal "White Hunter" probably would have been shot around 1970, would 
have starred Huston himself and Paul Newman as Verrill, and it would have been 
directed by either Huston or Sam Peckinpah. But that "White Hunter" doesn't 
exist and the one that Eastwood has made is a good, solid, admirable, deeply 
felt movie. 
</P>
<P>
It's well-acted -- not only by Eastwood, Fahey, Martin and Dzundza -- but by 
Alun Armstrong as a sour location manager and Timothy Spall as a raffish pilot. 
The last scene has withering power. And it's a movie that's about something: 
the contradictions of the artist and American macho, the evils of racism, the 
byzantine madness of some big-time movies. It's about exploitation and 
betrayal, man's attacks on nature and the dark side of the adventurous spirit. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fine film in many ways -- even if Huston's persona becomes Eastwood's 
own big tusker: the prey he can't quite shoot. He doesn't bring back the Big 
One, but he doesn't return empty-handed; intellectually and morally, there's 
plenty of game for the pot. 
</P>

ROSENTHAL TACKLES THE ENVIRONMENT, CENSORSHIP AND HER OWN AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rachel Rosenthal, the grand doyenne of L.A. performance art, is no conspiracy 
theorist. Yet she's making connections -- among the environment, censorship and 
her own personal psyche -- meant to jar a society bent on compartmentalizing 
its problems. 
</P>
<P>
Well-known for the eco-feminist and animal-rights slant of her spectaclelike 
image, sound and text collages, Rosenthal has taken on the task of speaking for 
the biggest silent being of all: the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Her "Pangaean Dreams," which tackles global, personal and political questions 
for the upcoming era, is being presented through Sunday at Santa Monica Museum 
of Art as part of the Los Angeles Festival. All performances are sold out. 
Collaborating with Rosenthal are Leslie Lashinsky, Dain Olsen and Eileen 
Cooley. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece is presented as a shamanic journey," Rosenthal says, seated in her 
West Hollywood studio with a pair of affable dogs at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I go back 250 million years ago, when all the continents were fused together, 
to when Pangaea broke up and all of the continents started to move." 
</P>
<P>
The journey isn't exclusively geological, though. Rosenthal interweaves the 
plight of Pangaea with her own aging process, extending the global metaphor to 
her recent "dismemberment." 
</P>
<P>
"I am dealing on a personal level with the realization that my body is 
disintegrating," says Rosenthal, a young-looking 63-year-old given to wearing 
lizard-shaped earrings and other fanciful oddments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep readjusting my work to the kind of movements I can do now. I've 
been going through breakages of my bones and all kinds of rifts in my body. In 
the past year, I've been in total agony." 
</P>
<P>
The personal aspect doesn't stop there, either. "I use this breaking up (of 
Pangaea and of her body) as a breaking up between two strong states of mind of 
mine that are completely in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"The convulsions we're going through as a society now have to do with trying to 
create a new society out of different paradigms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard because of the needs of privacy, the need to pursue your own 
happiness, and yet somehow (you have) to create a world that will be cohesive 
and make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, who recently turned down a $11,250 grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts because of a requirement that grantees sign a pledge not to make 
"obscene" work, says censorship is part and parcel of those "convulsions." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult, but there was never any question for me," she says of turning 
down the admittedly needed funds. "I couldn't have lived with myself if I'd 
taken that money, signing my name to that piece of obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
The Rubicon she faced represents a larger problem, Rosenthal says. "What is 
happening with the NEA is happening on so many levels in this country (that) 
it's frightening. On the other hand, it's waking people up, pushing things into 
a corner, making people realize the fragility and the preciousness of what we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
What's at stake is freedom, Rosenthal says, herself a refugee from World War II 
Europe. "Where else in the world can you say and do what you can say and do in 
this country? 
</P>
<P>
"The horrible thing is that if you don't do something about it, if you don't 
react and take action immediately, you wake up and it's gone. This is how it 
works in all the countries that have had a totalitarian takeover, so I get very 
nervous when I see that. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of aggressions by very toxic governments have been happening all 
the time," Rosenthal says, apropos of the current U.S. military operation in 
the Middle East after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"But we and other nations like ourselves seem to react only when it has to do 
with oil and other interests close to our economy. I'm very worried about 
chemical weapons. If they get started in any kind of war or skirmish over 
there, I'm worried it will create a precedent." 
</P>
<P>
As often in her performances, Rosenthal illustrates with a story. "It's the 
example of the poor frog that is put in the water, and then the water is heated 
little by little and the frog doesn't feel it because it's a cold-blooded 
animal," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"When the water boils, it's too late and the frog is dead. But if it's done 
gradually, the frog doesn't feel it." 
</P>
<P>
The American populace, Rosenthal says, hasn't noticed the temperature rising 
either. "People can't see it because everything around them seems to be OK. 
People have jobs and you don't go out and actually see anything terrible 
happening. We try to not notice all the homeless people, people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"That danger is on a social level," Rosenthal says of the connection between 
the political climate and other forms of global warming. "And the danger I've 
been harping about for years is an ecological danger." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, says Rosenthal, we persist in ignoring the damage we've done. "People get 
accustomed to smog, to having to buy bottled water. You still go to Baja or the 
high desert and see there's all this beauty and say, 'There's nothing wrong 
with the Earth, the Earth is doing fine. Leave me alone, I've got other things 
to worry about.' " 
</P>
<P>
This failure to notice -- like our inattention to the changes in politics -- is 
what Rosenthal sees as the greatest threat to the planet's future welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecology and the business of freedom are things that require an effort of the 
imagination. You can't be lazy. 
</P>
<P>
"As a species, we're tremendously selfish and destructive. I get very impatient 
with human beings; I never get impatient with all the other non-human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rosenthal thinks all this trouble may have a bright side. "In the coming 
decade people are probably going to take to the streets in strong and forcible 
ways. People will draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be in good enough shape to live into the 21st Century because 
I'm extremely curious," she says, returning to her concern with her own aging. 
"It's a tremendous 'whodunit' living in this world. I want to know what happens 
next. It will be either a complete turnaround or a total debacle."

MUSIC: AVANT-GARDE PERFORMER SANDRA TSING LOH COMPOSES A SYMPHONIC SCORE FOR 
DRIVERS AT A SANTA MONICA CARWASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Classically trained pianist Sandra Tsing Loh wants to be taken as a serious 
musician even though her Open Festival event Saturday, "Music at the Bonus 
Carwash," may do little to dispel her reputation for staging amusing 
avant-garde musical performances. 
</P>
<P>
The former Caltech physics major and USC English literature graduate student 
whose '87 Fringe Festival concert over the Harbor Freeway became the butt of 
Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" monologue has composed a five-minute symphonic 
work that's said to combine eerie "Twilight Zone" sounds with Gershwinlike 
passages to accompany the wash, rinse and dry processes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will think it's funny, brilliant or silly," Loh said. "What's 
important is that people respond, show up and it becomes a topic of 
conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Loh, 28, expects 40 participants between 6 and 8 p.m. to pay $15 to sit in 
their cars while listening to her audiocassette. Ten people have made 
reservations; 40 will cover her $300 costs for the event and the carwash on 
Lincoln Boulevard in Santa Monica cannot accommodate more cars in the two-hour 
period. 
</P>
<P>
After 1988's "Self-Promotion" concert when she showered her audience with 1,000 
$1 bills and last year's "Night of the Grunion" performance with the Topanga 
Symphony in Malibu -- complete with spawning fish -- Loh feels it's time to 
strive for critical recognition. Her first solo album, "Pianovision," produced 
by jazz musician Buell Neidlinger, is set for a fall release. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to create a big image that people will remember for the 
rest of their lives, a surrealistic dream people will walk away from and say, 
'I can't believe somebody did this,' " Loh said. "But with the album, my music 
is appraised on its own merits, not because there's money flying in the air or 
fish in the sand. It'll have to stand on its own." 
</P>

CHICANAS STRUGGLE AGAINST ART WORLD EXCLUSION ; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBIT: 'IMAGE AND IDENTITY' ASKS WHY CHICANAS ARE VIRTUALLY ABSENT FROM MAJOR 
LATINO ART SHOWS. 
</P>

As in most fields, women artists have a more difficult time "making it" than 
men artists, and the problem is compounded for those of Latino descent. But a 
show opening Saturday at Loyola Marymount's Laband Art Gallery is chipping away 
at that problem. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Image and Identity: Recent Chicana Art from 'La Reina del Pueblo de Los 
Angeles de la Porcincula,' " the exhibit features works by five women of 
Mexican heritage. The group complains that Chicana artists have been virtually 
passed over by major Latino art shows, including "Hispanic Art in the United 
States" at the L.A. County Museum of Art in early 1989; the recent European 
traveling show "Le Demon des Anges"; and to a lesser extent, "Chicano Art: 
Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-85," which opened last weekend at UCLA's Wight 
Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"There have definitely been omissions, and this show will help (to make up for) 
a lot of those glaring ones that have happened recently," said Sybil Venegas, 
curator of the exhibit, which includes five or six works each by photographer 
Laura Aguilar and painters Barbara Carrasco, Diane Gamboa, Margaret Garcia and 
Dolores Guerrero-Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to racism and sexism, said the women of "Image and Identity," there 
are several possible reasons for their difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia noted that women artists often deal with more personal, introspective 
themes, and therefore may create work seen as "less universal." Carrasco said 
Chicana artists addressed more political themes than men, which goes against 
the current trend of what she called "stereotypical" Chicano art. Gamboa 
believes women artists lack the camaraderie prevalent among men, and 
Guerrero-Cruz said that many women can't produce a large enough body of work 
because of such additional concerns as raising families. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times there is an underlying sexism that assumes that somehow men are 
more competent, and then (Chicanas) are put down on a cultural level as well," 
said curator Venegas, who teaches Chicana and Mexican art history at East L.A. 
College and Cal State Long Beach. "Mexican females are really outside of the 
mainstream. Any one of these women could have been included in 'Hispanic Art in 
the United States.' " 
</P>
<P>
In that show, Venegas said, only 3 of 29 artists were women. In three other 
recent Latino shows, women account for 20% to 29% of the artists: "Le Demon des 
Anges" had four women in a pool of 20, "CARA," has 41 women out of 169 artists, 
and four women are among the 14 in "Aqui y Alla," running at L.A. Municipal Art 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been excluded from a lot of the other shows, and the odds are against 
us in many ways as women," Gamboa said. "It's real obvious and hard to 
overcome, but it's important for the few of us that are doing it to stick with 
it. This show will help us do that." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero-Cruz agreed. "I am a woman and a Chicana -- which gives me two 
strikes. But I think our time has come. It's only recently that we've been 
complaining about it and have been able to start showing our works. This is the 
first Chicana show in which we have a large body of work that gives an accurate 
description of what we can actually do." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other Chicana shows, Venegas pointed out, but they have mostly 
been held at smaller, less respected community galleries. The last Chicana show 
in Los Angeles, she said, was in 1983 at SPARC Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is happening here. We are finally going somewhere," Venegas said, 
noting that the idea for the exhibit actually originated with Loyola 
Marymount's Chicano student group. "This show will make a difference because 
with the Laband Gallery, this stuff is coming into the institutional level. And 
because it's being institutionalized, people are going to see it as 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also said the tide is turning. "Our work is going to be making the 
statements. There's so much strength there that it can't be bottled any more. 
It's got to happen, because the work is meaningful and people will see that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Guerrero-Cruz: "I think we're going to surprise people. We really have 
some strong work, and we just haven't been able to show it.

BESSIES VIE WITH BOOS AT N.Y. AWARDS; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: PROTESTERS CALL FOR PHILIP MORRIS, PARTIAL SPONSOR OF THE DANCE AND 
PERFORMANCE AWARDS, TO STOP SUPPORT OF SEN. JESSE HELMS.

The scene outside the Brooklyn Academy of Music suggested a political rally 
rather than an awards ceremony. Self-styled cigarette girls and Marlboro men 
handed out rolled-up "Helmsboros," flyers calling on Philip Morris to cease 
supporting Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and urging a boycott of Philip Morris 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the name invoked most often Wednesday evening at the seventh annual New 
York Dance and Performance Awards (or Bessies as the awards are known) was not 
that of a performing artist but of Helms, whose efforts to impose restrictions 
on National Endowment for the Arts grants have inspired an activist response 
within New York's performing arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Both scheduled hosts for the event -- performance artist Karen Finley (who won 
a Bessie) and actress Danitra Vance -- withdrew to protest the partial 
sponsorship of the evening by Philip Morris Co. Inc. Philip Morris, which also 
supports the Next Wave Festival and a number of other arts events, is a major 
donor to Helms' current re-election campaign and a planned center to store 
Helms' papers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Stephanie French, a Philip Morris vice president, confirmed the 
company's continuing support for the Bessies as well as Helms. "Not all 
viewpoints were represented last night. We support Helms because of our tobacco 
interests. This does not mean we agree with him on other public-policy issues." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the BAM Opera House, the 3 1/2-hour ceremony was evenly divided between 
political pep talks (anti-Helms, outspokenly gay, and in support of an 
unrestricted NEA) and the awarding of the Bessies. 
</P>
<P>
In the performer category, awards went to Arturo Armijo, a dancer with Susan 
Marshall and Dancers; Victoria Finlayson of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; 
Penny Hutchinson, long time dancer with Mark Morris; Jonathon Reisling (now 
with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) for his performances with the 
Jamison Project; Louise Smith, for her performance in Ping Chong's 
"Brightness"; and Gail Turner, for her collective work with Meredith Monk. 
Recipients in this category receive a $500 cash award. 
</P>
<P>
In the category of choreographer/creator, for which $1,500 is awarded, there 
were nine awardees: choreographer Margarita Guergue and musician Hahn Rowe for 
their collaboration "We Were Never There"; the collaborative duo Eiko and Koma, 
for their dance "Passage"; Ulysses Dove for "Episodes," choreographed for the 
Ailey troupe; Karen Finley, for her controversial work "We Keep Our Victims 
Ready"; performance artist Robbie McCauley, for "Sally's Rape"; and Belgium 
choreographer Wim Vandekeybus. Choreographer Garth Fagan and performance artist 
Pat Oleszko were given sustained achievement awards. 
</P>
<P>
Special citations went to Annabelle Gamson, for her reconstructions of Isadora 
Duncan and Mary Wigman dances; Beate Gordon, for her presentations of Asian 
performing arts; and to Martha Wilson, founder and director of the performance 
space Franklin Furnace.

But the lords of darkness (the censors) said, "Let no one approach this tree. 
Let no one dare pick this fruit." And a girl whose name was Blood Girl knew 
this history. The maiden bravely asked, 'Why can't I know this tree's miracle?' 
And she jumped over the oppressor's words of warning and approached the tree. 
She approached the tree so that the myth could bring us together in its image. 
Because the woman is the freedom that provokes action. And the hero is the 
unhindered will."

<P>
 -- From "The Calabash Tree" 
</P>
<P>
by Pablo Antonio Cuadra 
</P>
<P>
Quito Downs, a writer and artist who lives in El Toro, grew up in Nicaragua 
during the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. As a teen-ager, he voiced 
his discontent by writing letters to the editor of La Prensa, the country's 
only independent newspaper. Several of the letters were published, but Downs 
left Nicaragua before he got to meet the editor, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, an 
internationally known poet and journalist who was imprisoned twice by Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
Downs was among the first to arrive to hear Cuadra, now 78, and other poets 
give recitals Wednesday night at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra, who combines the pre-Mayan myths of his homeland with the modern 
folklore of Central American Indians, read three poems, including "The Calabash 
Tree," dedicated to Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the publisher of La Prensa whose 
assassination in 1978 was a catalyst for the 1979 Sandinista revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra originally was a Sandinista supporter but became disillusioned with the 
movement's policies and eventually backed the Contras. In retaliation, the 
Sandinistas shut down La Prensa for 15 months in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government -- headed by Chamorro's widow, Violeta Barrios 
de Chamorro, who defeated Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in the February 
presidential election -- presents another opportunity for Nicaragua to achieve 
democracy. The Nicaraguan people, he said, have always loved freedom, but in 
the past, totalitarian governments have risen from the very revolutions that 
promised a better life. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra hopes that this time it will be different, since more countries are 
turning to democracy. The Eastern Europeans, he said, have helped pave the way. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra was a member of the 1920s' Vanguard literary movement, which sought to 
create a poetry indigenous to Nicaragua, free from European influences imposed 
by Modernism. He was influenced by the poet and revolutionary Augusto Cesar 
Sandino, who fought off a U.S. Marine occupation of Nicaragua during the 1920s 
and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra stepped down recently from his position as editor of La Prensa but still 
edits the newspaper's literary supplement. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian poet Juan Gustavo Cobo Borda also read Wednesday, along with Daphne 
Marlatt of Canada. The readings were part of La Terra Nova 1990, a weeklong 
festival organized by Cal State Fullerton to celebrate contemporary poetry of 
the Americas. The festival is a co-production of the Los Angeles Festival and 
the 1990-1992 Orange County Festival of Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
While Cuadra, Cobo Borda and Marlatt read in San Juan Capistrano, Guatemalan 
poet Carlos Illescas read at the La Habra Library along with Peruvian poet 
Blanca Varela. Veronica Volkow of Mexico, Alfonso Barrera Valverde of Ecuador, 
Gonzalo Rojas of Chile and Eduardo Mitre of Bolivia read at the Corbin Center 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup, selected by organizers Florinda Mintz and Paul Vangelisti, drew 
criticism from the Southern California Salvadoran community because it 
originally included David Escobar Galindo, a Salvadoran poet linked to the 
right-wing Cristiani government. Galindo eventually canceled so he could attend 
the United Nations peace talks that resumed this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We never meant to offend anybody," said Mintz, an Argentine writer who lives 
in Santa Ana. "The goal was to bring the poets here as individuals and artists, 
as world citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The festival closes today after an all-day student poetry workshop at Cal State 
Fullerton.

HANDCUFFED SUSPECT ESCAPES FROM POLICE CAR IN SEPULVEDA

<TEXT>
<P>
A man with his hands cuffed behind him escaped from the back seat of a patrol 
car in Sepulveda after undoing a seat belt and slipping the cuffs under his 
legs, Los Angeles police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Smith, 27, of Sepulveda escaped about 2 p.m. Thursday from the patrol 
car parked in the 15100 block of Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
He was still being sought today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was pulled over on a routine traffic stop and officers learned he was 
driving without a license, Capt. Jim Whitley said. When they checked the name 
he gave on a police computer, they learned a Michael Smith was wanted on a 
narcotics-related arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was arrested and placed in the patrol car. While officers were 
preoccupied with something outside the car, the suspect escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Whitley said officers learned after the escape that the suspect was not the 
same Michael Smith wanted on the arrest warrant but is a parolee. However, 
Whitley said the escapee is still being sought because his theft of handcuffs 
and interference with police violated his parole. 
</P>
<P>
The escape was the second in three weeks from a patrol car in Sepulveda. On 
Aug. 29. Willie Lozano, 31, was arrested in the 15700 block of Nordhoff Street 
when officers spotted him carrying merchandise believed stolen. 
</P>
<P>
After being placed alone in a patrol car, he unlocked his seat belt and slipped 
the handcuffs from his back to his front by sliding them under his legs, police 
said. He then jumped into the front seat of the patrol car, which was left 
running, and sped off. He later crashed the car after a chase and was charged 
with auto theft.

U.S. and Australian naval ships fired warning shots and halted an Iraqi tanker 
in the Gulf of Oman today as part of the effort to enforce trading sanctions 
against Iraq, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
A joint boarding party from the two ships -- the United States' Brewton and 
Australia's Darwin -- boarded the tanker Al-Fao to identify its cargo before it 
was permitted to proceed to its destination. 
</P>
<P>
"A joint boarding party . . . boarded the tanker, conducted a coordinated 
investigation and determined that the ship contained no prohibited cargo," the 
Pentagon said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ship was permitted to proceed to its destination -- the Iraqi port of 
Basra -- nearly five hours after the first shots were fired, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush confirmed that the incident occurred but gave few details during 
an impromptu session with reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the action was taken "in accordance with the United Nations 
resolutions, in accordance with the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
The President said the shots were fired because "it required a bit of a warning 
before the captain pulled over and permitted the boarding party to have a 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if today's events placed the United States any closer to a war with Iraq, 
Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope that this matter can 
be peacefully resolved. And the way for that to happen is for Iraq to comply 
with the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the third in the effort to put a stranglehold on Iraqi 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The first shots were fired on Aug. 18, when U.S. Navy ships attempted to halt 
two Iraqi tankers from departing the Persian Gulf region. However, neither of 
those ships was boarded.

TEENS ARRESTED IN WOUNDING OF 2-YEAR-OLD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DETECTIVES NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT THE SHOOTING IN LYNWOOD WAS 
DELIBERATE.

<P>
Three teen-age boys were arrested today in the wounding of a 2-year-old boy, 
but the shooting that prompted outrage among city officials is no longer 
considered deliberate, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The three youths, two aged 15 and one 16 years old, were booked for 
investigation of the attempted murder of Jonathon Fabian, said Sheriff's 
Detective Craig Ditsch. 
</P>
<P>
Their names were withheld because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon was shot in the stomach Tuesday as he played with a push toy in front 
of his home in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said three teen-age gang members, at least one carrying a gun, ran 
away after two shots were fired. Because no other gang members were seen in the 
area, investigators speculated that the boy may have been the intended victim. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators said today that the boy was not the target. 
</P>
<P>
"The three suspects were walking on Muriel Drive when they exchanged words with 
a group of rival gang members who drove in a vehicle," Deputy Bill Linnemeyer 
said. "Two of the boys on the street fired at the car, which drove past the 
2-year-old boy, who was caught in the cross-fire." 
</P>
<P>
The boy was in critical but stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew 
Medical Center today. His condition was expected to improve. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn had called the shooting the "crime of the 
century." The Board of Supervisors offered a $25,000 reward Thursday for 
information leading to the capture of the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood Mayor Robert Henning had declared that it was time to "stop coddling 
murderers no matter how old they are." 
</P>
<P>
"If gang members want to shoot each other, that's one thing," Ditsch said. "But 
it always bugs me when I see innocent people hurt. That feeling is just 
magnified when it's an innocent little boy."

SOARING ENERGY COSTS PUSH WHOLESALE PRICES UP 1.3%

The economic punch of the Persian Gulf crisis hit home today as the government 
reported a 1.3% increase in wholesale prices led by staggering hikes in energy 
costs -- and economists said the worst is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the figures "a matter of 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's index of crude goods, including crude petroleum 
products, rose 9.3%, the sharpest hike in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who didn't know this was coming obviously doesn't own a car," said 
David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "We've got at 
least a couple more months of prices increases." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of the shocks will take two to three months to manifest itself at 
the producer level and could take a little longer to go through the consumer 
level," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with skidding retail sales, which slipped 0.6% in August, and weak 
industrial production, which fell 0.2% last month, economists forecast a grim 
scenario of the U.S. economy in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst of all worlds -- higher inflation and weakening demand," Wyss 
said. "It's a hard combination to fight. You combine the (price) number with 
the weak retail number and the economy has real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"The timing (of the price increases) is very bad. Consumer confidence has been 
hurt," Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
After declining 0.5% in July, the department's index for finished energy goods 
climbed 9.5% in August. The crisis in the Middle East pushed gasoline prices up 
16.9% in August after they had fallen 5.3% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil prices skyrocketed 38.8% in August, the largest monthly 
advance since January's boost of 25.3%. Natural gas prices, however, slipped 
9.4% after rising 6.6% in July.

Poland today welcomed former President Ronald Reagan as the true father of 
Eastern Europe's democratic revolution, and he returned the compliment, saying 
it was the Poles who showed the world how to break the grip of communism. 
</P>
<P>
"Here . . . you began the global democratic revolution that is sweeping every 
continent and touching every people," Reagan said to warm applause on the first 
day of a two-day visit to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"You and your countrymen have won more than the admiration of the world for 
launching your democratic revolution," he told senators, deputies and ministers 
at a ceremony at Warsaw's Royal Castle. "You have won the world's respect for 
restoring your nation's independence against all odds."

MIND STILL OPEN ON ABORTION ISSUE, SOUTER SAYS

Supreme Court nominee David Souter said today that he has not made up his mind 
on the abortion rights issue and would consider both sides if he is confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with repeated probes for his predisposition in the case of Roe vs. Wade, 
Souter broke from his pattern of not commenting and stated flatly that he does 
not have a position. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs. Wade," Souter 
told the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I 
would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I must go the other way," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's comments came during his second day of testimony, during which he also 
said he was obligated as a state official to defend limits on the separation of 
church and state -- but he probably would have ruled for the opposite side had 
he been the judge. 
</P>
<P>
When in the New Hampshire attorney general's office, Souter defended former 
Gov. Meldrim Thomson's order that flags be lowered to half staff on Good 
Friday. He also prosecuted two Jehovah's Witnesses for covering the state 
motto, "Live Free or Die," on their license tags. 
</P>
<P>
Souter told the Senate Judiciary Committee today that he was obligated to 
defend the state if arguments could be made, and he maintained that he could in 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
But, he acknowledged, "If I were sitting as a judge today, I probably would 
have ruled the same way" as the one who decided the flag-lowering order was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
As for the license plate motto, he said the state did not have "a particularly 
compelling interest" in keeping its slogan visible. The couple did not cover 
the numbers on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
But Souter said it was important for him to pursue the cases. He said part of 
the job of upholding the Constitution was to bring forth arguments on issues. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, meanwhile, touted Souter today. He said on the White House lawn 
that his nominee's performance has been "magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he watched parts of the hearing Thursday and today "and my admiration 
for Judge Souter -- respect for him -- is even higher" than before. 
</P>
<P>
He said Souter had handled the panel's questions "with such intellect and such 
a knowledgeable manner" that no one could accuse him of evasion.

DECREE BARRED IN CHALLENGE TO GORBACHEV

The Soviet Union's constitutional watchdog has struck down a decree on rallies 
issued by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Tass news agency said today, in 
the first such attempt to limit his powers. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Compliance Committee ruled unconstitutional a decree issued 
by Gorbachev in April that took the power to authorize rallies in Moscow from 
the City Council and gave it to the Soviet central government. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a presidential decree has been struck down by the 
committee, which was established this year as part of reforms proposed by 
Gorbachev to oversee compliance with the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's power to rule by decree, granted by Parliament in March as part of 
his new presidential post, appears virtually unlimited as laid down in the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
He has used it most frequently in relation to rebellious republics, ordering 
paramilitary groups to turn in their weapons and declaring invalid a law passed 
by the Russian Federation that claimed control of the republic's natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass report that the committee had suspended the decree suggested that 
Gorbachev is expected to rewrite the document or repeal it. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional committee, whose 19 members were named by Parliament in 
April, was established as a rough equivalent of a constitutional court, part of 
an attempt to create a division of powers in the hitherto monolithic Soviet 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But it does not have the right to repeal decrees or laws by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Once the committee rules a law or decree unconstitutional, the measure is then 
suspended for three months. During that time, the Parliament that passed the 
law -- or in this case, the president -- is supposed to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced just two days before a rally is to be held by 
radicals in Moscow calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov, who has been severely criticized for his handling of the country's 
economic crisis.

The chairman of the House Banking Committee today described some government 
sales of failed savings and loans in late 1988 as "a giveaway" and said many of 
the deals should be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's top banking official said the government is 
considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale contracts but does not intend 
to break them. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released at a House hearing, investigators for the banking 
committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts received $78 in assets and 
government-granted benefits for every $1 of capital they put up to buy the 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"These so-called deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway -- with the 
recipients of the government largess being some of the fattest of the nation's 
financial fat cats," Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said. "We are hopeful that 
there can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said his committee will "haunt" the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency 
responsible for disposing of failed S&amp;Ls, "until we have hard evidence that 
everything is being done to recover as many of the billions as possible." 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, who heads the RTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
told the committee that the RTC's efforts "are to minimize costs to the 
government within the provisions of the contracts." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not considering breaking the government's agreements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee report concluded that 94 S&amp;L deals completed in late 1988 
will cost the government about $71 billion in assistance to buyers of the 
thrifts, including as much as $4.2 billion in tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators' study focused particularly on the sales of American Savings 
Bank FA of California and two giant Texas thrifts, Southwest Savings Assn. and 
First Gibraltar Federal Savings Bank.

Britain said today that its annual inflation rate broke through the 
psychologically important 10% level in August for the first time in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The retail price index, the country's main measure of inflation, showed a 
year-on-year rise of 10.6% last month, up from 9.8% in both June and July. 
</P>
<P>
It was higher than financial analysts had expected, but the London stock and 
currency markets took it in their stride and were little changed by the news. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation level, which excludes home loans and local taxes and 
is seen by some economists as a more accurate measure of price increases, also 
rose from 7% in July to 7.9% in August.

President Bush today sent Congress legislation to forgive part of Latin 
America's debt and aides said he will follow it by seeking authority for a 
free-trade pact with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
With the Persian Gulf situation focusing attention on world oil supplies, a 
free-trade pact with Mexico could help spur production in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has the world's eighth-largest reserves of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The United States already has such an agreement with Canada, under which all 
tariffs and other trade barriers will be lifted by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush would 
like to have congressional agreement to begin free-trade talks with Mexico 
ready when he goes to Mexico City in November. 
</P>
<P>
In a signing ceremony at the White House, Bush said the current attention on 
the Middle East does not lessen his Administration's commitment to Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has called for an eventual free-trade zone extending from the Arctic 
Circle to Cape Horn. He said the legislation sent to Capitol Hill today is an 
important step toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation submitted today would forgive about $7 billion in loans owed to 
the government by Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
</P>
<P>
Latin nations owe U.S. banks an additional $48.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also seeks to make it easier for U.S. companies to invest in Latin 
America. Bush called the package "trade, not aid." 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said the free trade measure could be sent to Congress as 
early as next week.

Iran is earning windfall revenues to the tune of $700 million to $800 million a 
month as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis triggering higher oil prices, 
Tehran radio reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying Iran has 
become the only secure place in the Gulf to load oil and that demand for 
Iranian oil was now very high. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of higher oil prices, the increase in Iranian oil revenues, since 
the crisis began Aug. 2, is running at $700 million to $800 million a month, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian oil minister, however, reiterated a stand he took shortly after the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last month: that member-states of the 13-nation 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should not pump more oil to make 
up for a shortfall on the world market.

Industrial production dropped 0.2% in August, the worst monthly performance 
since a 0.2% decline in April, the Federal Reserve said today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the government's first report on the manufacturing sector since the 
Persian Gulf crisis, and economists had expressed concern over the effect of 
sharply higher energy prices on factory activity. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial production had been sluggish even before the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, although it had fallen only twice previously this year, in April and in 
January. It was unchanged in July. 
</P>
<P>
Output of durable goods, motor vehicles and other big-ticket items was off 0.2% 
on top of a 0.3% decline in July. Manufacturing of non-durable goods such as 
food and clothing was unchanged after a 0.5% gain a month earlier.

RETAIL SALES DIP IN AUGUST DESPITE GASOLINE INCREASES

Retail sales slumped 0.6% in August despite a huge jump in the amount of money 
Americans spent on gasoline, the government said today in its first report on 
consumer spending since the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had said in advance that the report would be skewed by sharply 
higher gasoline prices that would offset falling sales elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sales in nearly all other categories declined. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase in gasoline sales apparently represented increased prices 
rather than volume. The American Petroleum Institute said gas prices rose about 
20% since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said overall sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $149.2 
billion, down from $150 billion in July. The July sales, which rose 0.4%, 
turned out to be stronger than the 0.1% gain originally reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
But a 1.1% advance in June had been the first increase since last January and 
analysts worried whether developments in the Middle East would jack up prices 
and erode consumer confidence, driving sales back down. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, two major consumer confidence surveys plummeted after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Since consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity, there was concern that a drop-off could help push the nation into a 
recession. Retail sales account for about half of overall consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department report said gasoline station sales jumped 6.4% in 
August, the largest increase since an 8.3% advance in August, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the gasoline category, retail sales tumbled even farther, down 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales fell 4.3%, their largest drop since a 5.6% decrease last January. 
Excluding the automobile category, sales would have risen 0.4%.

Can sultry seductress Barbara fool sex-starved Martin into betraying the 
secrets of France's revolutionary new tank to an evil foreign power? Or will 
faithful Francoise open his eyes before it's too late? 
</P>
<P>
French state-run arms exporter DGA (Delegation Generale pour l'Armement), which 
supplied Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with some of his best weapons, has 
decided that such soap opera fare could attract female recruits to the 
international arms trade. 
</P>
<P>
In an unlikely partnership, the DGA has teamed up with the romantic weekly "We 
Two" ("Nous Deux") to produce an illustrated love story for its recruitment 
campaign. Patriotism triumphs in the saga that starts publication next week. 
</P>
<P>
In an action-packed 24 pages of photo-drama, including steamy bedroom scenes, 
arms engineer Martin Saint-Priest -- "30s, elegant, charming" -- is pursued by 
two determined women. 
</P>
<P>
Tireless Francoise works at his side on the top-secret Leclerc tank program, 
her love undeclared, and unaware that Martin, too, yearns for her embrace. 
</P>
<P>
Busty Barbara makes her entrance on the Isle of Levant, where the exhausted 
team are enjoying rest and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The trained Mata Hari seduces Martin and comes within an ace of stripping the 
veil of secrecy from the arms program. But suspicious Francoise spots her 
making an impression of his keys to the computer and the spies are caught. 
</P>
<P>
The Leclerc, France's main battle tank for the 1990s and beyond, makes cameo 
appearances in the tale. The spies marvel over its 120 mm gun, its 
1,500-horsepower diesel engine, its speed, maneuverability, armor and 
night-sight. 
</P>
<P>
DGA Director of Communications Patrick Lamarque said the agency decided to 
sponsor the project to persuade women that an exciting career in the arms trade 
may await them. 
</P>
<P>
"We Two" sells 650,000 copies a week and is read by more than 1 million women, 
according to the publishers.

LEWIS' MANAGER SLAMS BEN JOHNSON;

Carl Lewis' manager said he is not concerned with Ben Johnson's expected return 
to track competition, calling him "a cheater" and questioning his ability as a 
drug-free sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Douglas, manager of the Santa Monica Track Club that includes Lewis and 
Leroy Burrell, also today likened some of the initial negotiations for a 
multimillion-dollar showdown race between Lewis and Johnson to "a circus." 
</P>
<P>
"What he (Johnson) does really doesn't concern us," Douglas said. "I don't 
consider him a threat unless he comes back on drugs. He's a cheater . . . he 
made a lot of money out of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson beat Lewis in the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Seoul Olympics with a 
world-record time of 9.79 seconds, but was stripped of his gold medal and his 
record after testing positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was banned from competition for two years. Lewis, who finished second 
at Seoul in 9.92 seconds, holds the world record. 
</P>
<P>
But with Johnson's ban coming to an end, he has resumed training and hopes to 
race against Lewis, possibly in the form of a lucrative showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas acknowledged that talks for such a race have begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been approached several times," Douglas said. "Nothing has been 
finalized, and I know that because I'm the one who does the negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas said that the offers have "all been too much of a circus." 
</P>
<P>
"One was for them to run on a boardwalk, another for a race in a parking lot," 
he said. "I don't think the people were credible." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the largest offer so far was for $6 million. He refused to give 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear: We want drug testing, the financing has to be good, and 
it must promote the sport," Douglas said. "Many other people, not just Johnson, 
can offer us that." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is here with Lewis and Burrell, who are scheduled to race in the 100 
meters in tomorrow's Toto Super Track Meet '90. Burrell beat Lewis in the 100 
at the Goodwill Games in July and owns the year's fastest time -- 9.96. 
</P>
<P>
If Johnson and Lewis are to race each other again, it could be in Tokyo, which 
hosts the 1991 World Championships. Johnson has said he hopes to compete in 
that meet.

<P>
Emmy Award-winning sports television producer Chet Forte pleaded guilty today 
to federal income tax and fraud charges 
</P>
<P>
His attorney said the charges were a result of compulsive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Forte helped make "Monday Night Football" a national pastime when he worked for 
ABC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
The plea was accepted by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Rodriguez. Forte, 54, 
faces a maximum 11 years in prison and $27,000 in fines when he is sentenced 
Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Forte was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges he fraudulently obtained 
nearly $1.5 million in loans from banks and mortgage companies. He was charged 
with failing to file a 1987 income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
The charges allege Forte concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in debts 
owed Atlantic City casinos, as well as Internal Revenue Service assessments.

Florida State officially joined the Atlantic Coast Conference today after 
receiving unanimous approval from the Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an outstanding opportunity for Florida State, and I'm sure they'll 
make the most of it," said Charles Reed, chancellor of the state university 
system. "It's a good fit for the Board of Regents' goal of making 
student-athletes students first." 
</P>
<P>
The ACC formally extended the invitation Thursday night, and Florida State 
officials and the regents immediately moved through bureaucratic details to 
sanction the move. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State President Bernard Sliger was elated with the outcome after months 
of deliberations over possible membership in the ACC or the Southeastern or 
Metro conferences. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an achievement for Florida State when you consider where we were 15 years 
ago in regard to this," Sliger said. "If someone would have told me we'd be a 
likely candidate for a major all-sports conference . . . personally, I feel 
very, very good about what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State officials called a news conference for Saturday at which Sliger 
and ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan will discuss details of the membership. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a terrific opportunity for us in terms of every aspect of 
athletics, in terms of how they view athletics and how we view athletics," 
Sliger said. "This is the fast lane, and we would hope we can keep up." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State is ranked third in this week's Associated Press football poll and 
finished in the top three each of the last three years. Only once in those 
seasons did an ACC team finish in the Top 10; Clemson was ninth in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Corrigan said in a prepared statement that Thursday's vote to expand followed 
long talks and that Florida State had been an attractive candidate from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
The current members of the ACC are Clemson, Duke, Georgia Tech, Maryland, North 
Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia and Wake Forest. Duke and Maryland 
voted against the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I questioned whether expansion was in the best interests of the ACC," Duke 
athletic director Tom Butters. "I never had a question about Florida State." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Florida State marks the fourth time the ACC's membership has 
changed. There were seven charter members in 1953 -- Clemson, Duke, Maryland, 
North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina and Wake Forest. Virginia 
joined later that year, South Carolina left in 1971, and Georgia Tech joined in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that if the ACC added a ninth school, a 10th would 
naturally follow. But ACC President Tom Spragens, Duke's faculty 
representative, said he would oppose that and does not sense support for it.

FAIRPLEX PARK'S FIRST WEEKEND SEES SHEPHERD, JOHNSTON STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of three weekends of racing at Fairplex Park on the L.A. County 
Fairgrounds in Pomona opens Saturday with 12 races on the track and the 
simulcast of the Woodward Handicap from Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodward is expected to feature the leading contender for Horse-of-the-Year 
honors, Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodward will be shown between early races on the program and will offer 
win, place, show and exacta wagering. It will not be part of the Pick Six nor a 
portion of the early daily double. 
</P>
<P>
On-track action will be highlighted by the $50,000-added Phil D. Shepherd 
Stakes for 3-year-olds and up. The winner of the 1 1/16-mile Shepherd receives 
an automatic berth in the $150,000 Pomona Invitational, the richest 
thoroughbred race of the meet. The invitational will be run Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Fillies and mares are in the spotlight Sunday in the $50,000-added E. B. 
Johnston Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Two added-money events for quarter horses also are slated. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 3-year-olds meet in the $12,500-added Call Caleb Stakes, honoring 
the track record-holder at 870 yards. The $15,000-added Express Stakes on 
Sunday pits 3-year-olds and upward at 350 yards.

<P>
T.K.'s Skipper, the fastest aged pacer of all time, will contest the second leg 
of the American Pacing Classic on Saturday at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old will be trained in California by Joe Anderson for New 
Jersey-based Nick Sodano. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the leading driver at the Orange County track, will pilot the world 
champion Saturday night in the field of nine. The race will be carded as the 
ninth on the program. 
</P>
<P>
In his last outing, Sept. 1, T.K.'s Skipper clocked a mile in 1:49 2/5 at 
DuQuoin, Ill., in a time trial effort, to become the fastest aged pacer in 
harness history. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the first leg of the series, Riviera Hanover, will return to face 
T.K.'s Skipper. Returning from a bout with a virus will be the Robert 
Gordon-trained Speedy Alba, who registered four wins in a row at Sacramento and 
Los Alamitos before calling in sick on Sept. 1.

SOME SINGERS ARE GREEN, BUT PITCH IS EARNEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Goldie sings! And Meryl too, a little bit, though you were probably expecting 
that after the big musical finale of "Postcards From the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
Hawn and Streep spoke some, too, at Thursday night's all-star benefit at the 
Greek, though not very much specifically about Proposition 128, the upcoming 
"Big Green" state initiative for which the show was ostensibly set to raise 
money and local awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Since the evening was also being taped for airing Wednesday at 10 p.m. on ABC 
as a pro-environmentalism special, where it will be shorn of any specific 
references to the California ballot contest, the tone of the show was less akin 
to a political pep rally and more along the general lines of "The Earth Day 
Special -- Part II." 
</P>
<P>
Among the sponsoring "Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet" were Bette 
Midler, Cher, Olivia Newton-John, Lily Tomlin, Streep and Hawn, with Robin 
Williams as the sole "other" on the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
It was a better night for comedy than music, with Williams' typically 
out-of-hand 20-minute rant -- aimed at Hussein, Helms, Souter and 
right-to-lifers -- the obvious highlight of a middle-of-the-road affair. About 
five-eighths of it was suitable for TV. 
</P>
<P>
One of Williams' impressions was of an ABC editor frantically at work, and the 
comedian kept fretting, with some palpability, about how the 7-year-old staring 
at him from the front row was throwing him off on the more risque portion of 
his act. "You're going to go through puberty tonight, Tommy," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
The unintentional comedy of Cher's final number was nearly as impressive. 
Though she carried herself with some dignity for most of her five-song set, the 
chuckles started coming during "Fire Down Below" when the diva was joined by 
seven chain-wearing dancers who gyrated, mostly unchoreographed, to what 
sounded like an uproarious parody of a metal guitar solo. Cher fared better 
earlier with "Many Rivers to Cross," a soulful song that doesn't lose its charm 
turned into a showy pop ballad. 
</P>
<P>
Midler and Newton-John were big draws by virtue of the fact that they rarely 
grace a concert stage any more. Newton-John allowed that it had been eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Midler, who brought a band, came off best in her old racy "Soph" persona with 
"Pretty Legs and Great Big Knockers," but got the big applause for her ballads. 
Newton-John inevitably looked a little silly singing to accompaniment tapes -- 
especially on "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" from her lullaby album. TV's older 
demo'll love it, though. 
</P>
<P>
Equally mawkish, Hawn recited poetry ("I think that I shall never see . . . ") 
and crooned the Muppets' "It's Not Easy Being Green" in a somewhat more assured 
alto than you'd expect (but hold the record contract). 
</P>
<P>
Streep followed with a good, earnest speech about environmentalism 10 years ago 
versus now -- it'll be remembered far better than her McCartney/Grammy one -- 
and then was joined by the entire company for "What a Wonderful World," to 
which she and Hawn both bravely contributed verses. It's not easy being a green 
singer.

Rodney Dangerfield left 'em laughing after three days of testimony in his 
lawsuit against Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
The comedian's lawyers surprised a federal judge Thursday by resting their case 
after calling only Dangerfield and a hotel employee as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield contends that he suffered a serious eye injury in a steam bath at 
the resort in March, 1988. He completed his combative and contradictory 
testimony with a flourish, getting jurors and spectators to laugh as he told a 
joke to demonstrate how he uses his eyes in his stage act. 
</P>
<P>
"My dog found out we look alike. So he killed himself," Dangerfield said, his 
eyes bulging for effect. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Roger Foley recessed the trial until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield, 68, is suing Caesars for $225,000 in lost wages and $5 million in 
punitive damages. Caesars countersued, seeking $100,000 and punitive damages.

BURNS, 94, STILL LOVES SHOW BUSINESS 
</P>

By 11 a.m., George Burns is sitting in his Hollywood office, schmoozing on the 
phone and finishing off cigar No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
He's just nixed an offer to work with Bob Hope in Australia for five weeks. 
"Too tough," he explains. "I'm 94. I faint twice a day, sometimes three times a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
A long pause, then the gravelly, smoke-filled voice breaks into laughter. 
Although he lacks a stage and a large audience, the elder statesman of comedy 
can't help but turn a phone conversation into a joke fest. 
</P>
<P>
On being interviewed: "It's very nice to be 94 years old and get out of bed to 
be interviewed. At 94, you can't make any money in bed." 
</P>
<P>
On the new comedians: "You mean the younger kids like Milton Berle and Danny 
Thomas? Oh, they'll all make it." 
</P>
<P>
During his 86 years in the business, Burns has become known as the 
self-deprecating master of the one-liner, a best-selling author and 
Oscar-winning actor. But the show-biz legend offers one simple reason for his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"I love show business," he says. "That keeps me going. Lemme tell you 
something, and this goes for all your readers: Fall in love with what you're 
going to do for a living." 
</P>
<P>
For Burns -- whose real name is Nathan Birnbaum -- the love affair began in 
1904 on New York's Lower East Side. His father had died, and the 8-year-old, 
born ninth of 12 children, wanted to earn extra money. After selling 
newspapers, running errands and shining shoes, he found his real calling: 
performing. With several friends, he formed the Peewee Quartet and combed the 
streets looking for people willing to shell over a coin for a song. 
</P>
<P>
By age 14, Burns had left school for vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
He tried impersonations, trick roller skating and Latin dancing, and even 
played in a trained-seal act. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very lucky," he recalls. "In those days, there were places to be bad. 
There are no places to be bad today. The only place you can play today is the 
comedy clubs and the Johnny Carson show. But in vaudeville in those days, they 
had thousands and thousands of theaters. . . . When I started in show business, 
it would take you seven or eight years to play every theater. And I was bad for 
a lot of years, but I didn't think I was bad. . . . I thought the audience was 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
Burns' luck changed when he teamed up with an unemployed Irish-American actress 
named Gracie Allen. She played the scatterbrain; he was the straight man. "I 
was able to think of the things, and Gracie was able to do them," he says. 
"That's what made us a good combination." 
</P>
<P>
After performing together for three years, the couple married in 1926. Over the 
next 36 years, they made movies, created a legendary radio show and TV program, 
and formed their own multimillion-dollar production company. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I went on the stage to work with Gracie, I used to walk out by myself 
to see which way the wind was blowing so the smoke from my cigar didn't go in 
Gracie's face," Burns recalls affectionately. "If I blew smoke in Lucille 
Ball's face, she'd blow it back. But . . . Gracie, she was very fragile. She 
weighed about 95 pounds, dainty and beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
After Allen's death from a heart attack in 1964, Burns submerged himself in his 
career -- going on to win an Oscar for his supporting role as an 
ex-vaudevillian in "The Sunshine Boys," playing God in the movie "Oh, God" and 
its sequels, and penning numerous bestsellers, including "Gracie: A Love 
Story," an affectionate memoir about his wife and their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
He still lives in the Beverly Hills home the couple shared and visits Gracie's 
grave once a month. "I talk to Gracie sometimes. I tell her a joke, but she 
doesn't laugh. She's heard them before," he says.
